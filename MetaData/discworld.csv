noticed a recurring theme. In every single one of his books where rank, Mr. Pratchett seems to have a fixation on Seargents. Well, perhaps not a fixation, but a sincere respect or admiration. I was just wondering why.

His reply:

Sergeants are useful, and have to maintain a relationship with the men below and the officers above. The have to master a lot of skills. For an author, that means 'useful'.

- [Tiffany Aching](http://cam-crea.com/en/creations/Dolls/FanArt/Tiffany%20Aching/tiphaine_0001.jpg): Even if things evolve along the way, followed around by a sheep and 3 Nac Mac Feegles.
- [Susan Sto Helit](http://cam-crea.com/en/creations/Dolls/FanArt/Susan%20Sto%20Helit/): Her white hair with a touch of black, there is a black tree with a crow, an hourglass, and she is carrying a scythe.

Work has been completed on The Long War (the sequel to The Long
Earth) and as reported later in this issue will be released in June.

The Long War - the second book in The Long Earth series will be
released on 20 June 2013. And is available to pre-order from Amazon
now.

Terry and Rob have locked themselves away and have been working
extensively on the next full adult Discworld novel - they are making
good progress and the words are really steaming along. I can also
confirm that this novel will NOT be Raising Taxes.

Some of the newspapers have reported that Rhianna Pratchett will
take over writing Discworld novels after Terry stops.  Rhianna and
Terry actually meant that Rhianna is well placed to concentrate on
co-writing the adaptations for Narrativia and working on spin off
works because of her in depth knowledge of Discworld.  Rhianna has
no plans to write Discworld novels as she feels Discworld these
should remain her father's legacy.

The Discworld App comes a step closer.  A screenshot of the App was
recently pasted on the Terry Pratchett Facebook page.  The App will
initially be released for the iPad only and there are currently no
immediate plans to support other platforms

It seems plausible that Vetinari intends to someday hand leadership of Ankh Morpork over to Moist Von Lipwig.  He's given Moist a lot of power already, Moist's reign could be more like Zaphod Beeblebrox, or Lord Julius from _Cerebus_.

Tiffany Aching is obviously cut out to be one of the greatest witches of them all... probably THE greatest.  But that doesn't mean that she'll be able to become ""head witch"" (the leader they don't have :D ) overnight.  The key problem, so teaming up with Nanny and Agnes will be tricky.  I think the next generation of witch books will probably feature more travel (as communication tech continues to bring the Disc closer together), with Tiffany often aching for her home.

Lady Margolotta may never feel the need to retire, the greatest control is self-control.  I could see her leaving her castle and studying in the Hublands, maybe.  Rumor has it some of the monks up there *really* know a few things about control.

But of course she couldn't leave without finding a successor, who has the trust of the mountain orcs and goblins and Om-Knows-What-Else.  If needed, he could raise an army to unite Uberwald, but he wouldn't do that, would he?

Nutt has one more possible advantage in politics:  Since he's no human, or vampire, he is equally untrustworthy to almost everyone... and so he's universally acceptable.

Vimes... well... who could replace Vimes?  Nobody.  So nobody will.  Carrot and Angua will head the Watch officially

In *Snuff*, effectively expanding the Watch far beyond the city walls.  Commander Angua will be the best-informed head copper in the history of head coppers, and Commander Carrot will be as universally respected as Vimes ever was, but with a lot less burning hatred and a lot more of people belatedly realizing they've been outsmarted.

Thinking about these things has made me a lot more optimistic about the future of the series.  Of course things are going to be much different after Terry goes

    (Chorus)
    Ohhh a wizard's staff 'as a knob on the end
    A wizard's staff 'as a knob on the end
    If there's only one thing on which you can dep-e-e-end!
    It's that a wizard's staff 'as a knob on the end!

    SONG STARTS HERE

    I saw in Ankh-Morpork the other day
    An unlicensed thief see 'is luck slip away
    'e nicked off with a bag but then froze up in dre-e-ad!
    As out popped a knob

    [Chorus]

    A wizard once went on a visit to Klatch
    The weather was in an 'orrendous dry patch
    So he slapped 'is knob right in the palm of 'is 'a-a-and!
    And he spread wide 'is magic all over the land!

    [Chorus]

    Down Uberwald way they're a funny old lot
    'owever you look it don't matter a jot
    But even there they know if you see a kno-o-o-ob!
    A wizard is usin' 'is tool for the job!

    [Chorus]

    Some Fourecksian bandits were right soddin' thick
    Tried robbin' a man all 'unched over a stick
    But 'e flourished it then an' 'e started to la-a-a-ugh!
    Cause they all saw the knob on the end of 'is staff!

    [Chorus]

    A friend of a friend asked a wizard
    'ow come the knob on 'is staff was so key
    The only thing on which all wizards agree
    So 'e gestured 'im close 'an 'e said:
    “Ohhh
    As a wizard stores power 'is knob starts to grow
    Without it you can't get the magic to flo-o-o-w
    You just tap on the end

    [Chorus]

I remember being scared shitless because I wasn't that keen on the book covers and feeling a bit like I was intruding as well

I ended up in a bare but wonderful cottage, explained through each canvas, given a cup of tea and Josh Kirby was incredibly sweet to a nervous 14 year old wannabe illustrator. He also amused me by telling me how he reserved the revolving display of prints for 'Pratchett wannabes who made him money', and I could see exactly what he meant. I spent a very happy afternoon drinking tea and staring at his walls, while he very bashfully talked me through everything and seemed as shy of me as I was of him.

The Truth was either about to be released or just released, so I can't even remember if the art I saw was the final cover. I remember the colour scheme was the same, and I think it was close enough if not the same.

It was the last cover. Josh Kirby died a year later. I feel honoured to have shared that moment with him. He signed my copy of Guards! Guards!, and for a 14 year old that felt like the end of the world, I felt this more than made up for that! As a Discworld fan and wannabe illustrator I couldn't have picked a better 'date'.

* Sam Vimes - cards are watchmen and a few vagabonds that Cmmdr Vimes uses when necessary.
* Assassins - those men of learning
* 'Killers' - thugs and killers. Tensions came to a head
* Local Wizards - the Dean came back to AM for the day
* Uprise Wizards - wizards who

Each character in the game has a variety of stats associated *(a simple 1-5 metric, and William de Worde - AKA the GM - plays out the simple scenario using the relevant stats. The players can give simple orders to their characters *(""ignore the jewels, but attempt to kill any Assassins you see."")*, but the character will need to be smart enough or loyal enough to understand and follow them!

Each mission has three stats that will be needed - trying to break up a pub brawl req. Strength, and the sums of stats for each character tell of how well they do, but characters will interact in surprising ways! 

Each player has a list of DOs, and away you go!

Has anybody seen those forum threads?  It's something like: you're given a list of characters that each start with, and if a character reaches 0, they're eliminated.

Based on that

THE FIRST PERIODIC ANKH-MORPORK CRIPPLE MISTER ONION INVITATIONAL

**sponsored by Hoyle

*Catering by Sister Drull*


For three days, we'll take the highest-voted 12 characters.

Then we play a series of games, people wouldn't just automatically vote for their favorite character.  We would actually ask ourselves, ""who at this table would really be most likely to win?  What strategies might they use?  What alliances might form, and would they be adhered to?""  Of course noone really knows the rules of Cripple Mr. Onion, but that fact will be of help to us because it means we can freely apply the [Rule of Cool](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool) and the [Rule of Funny](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny).) At the end of each round, the lowest-voted player will be eliminated.

The schedule will look something like this (assuming that the last-listed character is eliminated in each round):

* DAY 1 players: A, D, E, F
* DAY 2: G, J, K, L
* DAY 3: A, H, C
* DAY 4: I, E, K
* DAY 5: A, D
* DAY 6: B, E
* DAY 7: A
* DAY 8: J
* DAY 9: A, G
* DAY 10: A
* DAY 11 HEADS UP!!!: A

After each round

After day 11

BY THE WAY... the tournament itself will not take place in this humdrum dimension.  Hoyle is not bound by normal spacetime, past or future, living or dead!

2/18/13 UPDATE 12:08pm PST:

Well, let's go for it!

**Nominations will continue until I see that we have *TWELVE* players, say, *EXACTLY 24 HOURS* afterward... and then it's showtime!**

***

2/18/13 UPDATE 03:43pm PST:

Okay, so in about twenty-six hours!**  (still plenty of time to cheat, so start making those throwaways!)  And don't be afraid to downvote!  I have a feeling that's the only way we're going to break some of these ties.

2/19/13 UPDATE 04:30pm PST:

Alright

(I was wondering how to account for reddit's infamous ""vote-fuzzing"" (or whatever causes upvotes and downvotes to seemingly fluctuate)

1.  Bugger it

Id like to see more Rincewind. Having been sidelined as professor of cruel and unusual geography is a waste of a character. Having being introduced to discworld via the adventure games Rincewind and all the Wizards have a special place in my heart. 

Teppic (Pteppic) needs a new adventure. Perhaps as a video game. The assassins guild and all the narrative that goes with it is too good to waste and a game (think assassins creed but in ankh morpok) would be amazing. 

A final vetinari novel would be good. Maybe to tie in with Vimes. The trope of the tyrant slayer grandchild and a tyrant would be too good to refuse. It's pretty obvious Drumknott would be the antagonist. 

I don't really care about Moist von Lipwig although I did enjoy both novels and if it wasn't for Watchmen it would be my favourite books. 

Granny Weatherwax needs one more adventure before she dies as well. 

Susan is one of my favourite fictional characters but the whole Death's Granddaughter is played out. 

I don't think ive left anyone major out.

Review:  The Long War

Reviewed by Jason Anthony

If you haven't read The Long Earth yet you may want to look away
because its hard to review The Long War without including spoilers
for The Long Earth.

The Long War is set a decade after Joshua and Sally return from
their long adventure with Lobsang.  In the preceding ten years the
Black Corporation have given the technology behind the Mark Twain
(Lobsang's ship) to the world and now 'twains' are a fairly common
sight over the Long Earth.

Joshua feels his travelling days are over and has settled down with
his wife Helen and his son Dan deep in the Long Earth.  His life
however
help with protecting the Long Earth trolls because they are being
badly mistreated by humans.

Along with Joshua and Sally
Earth's characters again and its interesting to see how a decade in
the Long Earth has affected each of them.  It also introduces a
whole raft of characters as well as two new sentient species - the
beagles and the kobolds.

Once again
You get lots of disparate threads that slowly progress the story
forward with no real obvious idea for the reader how they are going
to resolve.  Then suddenly something dramatic happens and the pace
suddenly changes.

I really did enjoy the book but at the same time I feel that it
seemed to take too long to go anywhere.  I loved how the
relationships between the characters both old and new developed
through the story.  When the tension did build it was gripping and
at times there were some poignant moments.

If you enjoyed The Long Earth then you should definitely read The
Long War.  If you haven't read The Long Earth
see if you like it!

Comedy as an art form has always had a bit of trouble with the written word.

You go around to various points on the board winning over volunteers over to your cause either by charming them, or bribing them.  These volunteers will then run the spell back to the university for you.

For me Terry Pratchett effected my whole life. From the age of eight my mother got me to read the Discworld series, I read all of his books and still do loving every second of them. At the age of eleven I realised that I wanted to follow in his footsteps and become a writer so I spent days writing, starting with poems, then short stories and then at 14 I finished my first book.

A vampire novel set on another world called Vampiric. Needless to say the book did not get published, a novel from a series similar to Kelly Armstrong's ""Women of other world"" series, about a Werewolf called Cadaras and his journey for revenge. This too did not sell or get published but I didn't give up because my sights were still set on Terry Pratchett.

Now, a steampunk-esque series about a young aristocrat that becomes a skytraveller was released on kindle and has begun selling. I have contacted several agents and if I'm lucky this will be the one.

I never truly realised how much he gave me, the world and politics/religion. He made me who I am today, so what about you?
