--------

The whole topic has deviated. I want to get to the bottom of the being a dick rule.

Not everyone is aware that it is a 'catch-all' for shit behaviour. Why not just write ""Mods reserve the right to remove players at their discretion"" if you want a catch-all.

Players like myself and others will point at the current ruling and say ""Get rid of him. He's being a dick"". And then matters like this arise.

In relation to what happened between me and Pkome I just think it's a shitter when I would have to log off for a while or stop what I had intended to do because somebody else can't play the game with consideration for others enjoyment.

AGAIN! I am not anti-PvP. I'd play on PvE if this was the case. It is not.

A rule we do have is ""No harassment"". For those that don't know the definition it is as follows:

""A feeling of intense annoyance caused by being tormented.""

Now as far as I can see this is another rule that gets ignored to the discretion of the mod online at the time. But whatever.

It's becoming clear that the only way to beat the people that ruin the game for you is to go find another server. What kinda server is run with that ethos in mind?

Anyway. There's my opinion and my clarification on what this thread was about. It's raised a ton of discussion which is quite cool

Thanks to the people that were constructive. As for those who can't read or think ""Go somewhere else"" is the answer

Thanks! -Pete


ORIGINAL

It's time this was either elaborated on and enforced

Certain players get their rocks off it seems jerking around other players and typically ruining the gaming experience

Responses of ""Go PvE"" can fuck off. I enjoy the survival aspect of the game. But this isn't COD here. It's a game where killing is an aspect of it

The Reddit servers shouldn't be represented by childish sociopaths whose only form of pleasure is making other players mad and frustrated. It will eventually come down to the abandonment of the server in favour of one run with a better sense of fairplay by mods who care about the well-being of it's users.

I'm not throwing my toys out of the pram and I'm not complaining about the PvP extents on the server. I'm trying to address an issue that does need to be spoken about properly and an outcome reached.

Hi all

Now that details of the exploit our servers have been facing today are becoming widespread, and how we plan to respond moving forward.  Skip to the TL;DR if you don't need details.

----

First sign of trouble was at 5:54am* this morning

At 9:06am, who in turn gave those privileges to 10 more players.  Collectively, this group used the full range of admin powers to attack C, such as WorldEdit, bans/unbans, etc.

We became fully aware of this about 20 minutes later. As we began to assess the damage, exactly.

It quickly became clear that someone had gained access to forty_two’s account, the hackers were about to log onto S using forty_two’s account again - forty_two confirmed that he hasn't logged into any unknown servers lately ruling out a MITM attack. It's also impossible that the hackers cracked his password so quickly. (A few other admin accounts were compromised, but not able to do any meaningful damage.)

Once we realized that hackers were able to bypass authentication entirely for certain users

* Immediately took backups of the S and P servers (nothing was lost)
* Brought down all servers
* Parsed through the logs of every account that was compromised and given illegitimate admin privileges
* Made a  [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/wjxg5/server_admins_did_notchsephblingetc_log_in/) to /r/admincraft with the thought of cross-comparing plugin lists to find one with a back door. We decompiled and pulled PEX and NoCheatPlus apart
* Retrieved the most recent available backup of the C map (approximately 10 hours old)
* Set up the temp chaos map (event.nerd.nu) once it became clear this wouldn’t be fixed soon.

To eliminate the chance of it being a plugin bug/backdoor, and [advertised this fact](http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/wk6ey/creative_and_whitelist/). Within an hour, the hackers took the bait (twice) and connected to the (now whitelisted) c.nerd.nu server, again as forty_two.  The details of what we learned are on [barneygale’s r/minecraft post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/wl0zy/psa_exploit_in_minecraft_login_server_hackers_can/), but the net result of our investigation is that there was a major exploit in the Mojang authentication servers, and thus a proper solution was beyond our ability.  Essentially, **it is possible for Mojang authentication to be bypassed entirely for some users**

We’ve spoken to Mojang staff about this, but hold off on posting a general PSA about the exploit, as it is unfortunately easy to execute once known.  However, since full details of the exploit are now circulating rapidly, we feel it important to get everyone on the same page (especially if you have your own servers to protect!).  Our recommendations for how to handle your own servers are listed in [barneygale’s r/minecraft post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/wl0zy/psa_exploit_in_minecraft_login_server_hackers_can/).

*all times in US MDT

----

Here are the actions we will be taking

* **Once the exploit is resolved
* We will be reconfiguring our backup scheme to ensure more recent backups are available in the future.
* We will be expediting our move from PermissionsEx to bPermissions

Thanks for your patience and understanding as we handle an issue that has been largely out of our hands.  And please remember to thank everyone who did an incredible job staying on top of this for 18 hours now and counting

----

**TL;DR:** Servers brought down due to Mojang-level exploit allowing bypass of Mojang auth for certain users; C was attacked using this exploit; all servers will come back up with current maps once exploit is fixed (S and P exactly as is

Thanks to everyone who has been working to get the servers and maps ready

Some details on how 1.5 Redstone Update features will work on the servers:

* Hoppers will be completely allowed, furnaces, etc.) unless you are the owner of said object. This will prevent someone from, for example, placing a hopper next to a chest they don't own and stealing its contents. This will NOT prevent a hopper from being placed next to an unlocked chest, even if the chest is locked later, so be careful!
* Since they are containers, and trapped chests. Remember on S: ""No use of LWC-locked blocks for the purpose of base defense or any other use than to protect the items within the locked block."" (Also remember that you can't LWC-lock minecarts with chests, since they are entities.)
* Minecarts with hoppers won't be allowed
* Anything else in the 1.5 update will be available in its full glory!

The only plugin we haven't gotten working fully in 1.5 at this point is SafeBuckets. We'll be debugging it today; if we can't get it working in time for launch we'll let you know what the alternative arrangement will be.

Look for more specific details about the new P and S revisions later this weekend!

As it currently stands there is a lot going on within nerd.nu

There are lots of new staff coming on

Behind the faces of our [pretty](http://redditpublic.com/wiki/Ooer) front line staff there is a small team of [tech admins](http://katmou.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/gremlins-gizmo.jpeg)

this is...*bad*.

When a problem arises

\#RedditMC is where we all hang out

That

So starting now we will hopefully be taking a more interactive role in the community, and our frequent demands of pizza.

*So

There are some things we are currently aware of

1. Live maps are down
2. Abuse of logging on Survival
3. Rollbacks and frequent crashes on PvE
4. Chaos server down
5. Length of downtime upon crashes
6. Mob limits [S &amp; P]
7. Frequent spam attacks

Phew

Not to fret

#### Live maps ####

Not a whole lot of movement

A more frequently updated carto should be in the works

#### Logging during PvP ####

As many survival players well know there has been a lot of talk about how to deal with loggers, things like switches inventories, item duping and invulnerability are words associated with logout cool downs, and not something we are able to allow to happen.

Thus a reactive approach was taken, and also recorded to logs, building a history for each player that can be called upon to reinforce bans for logging. Currently running quite successfully.

#### Rollbacks and crashes on PvE ###

PvE is somewhat the black sheep of the nerd.nu family. With the introduction of PTM in the generation of the map the number of entities grew considerably. With so many overhangs

Despite the noticeable positive effect this had on server load it still was not enough. So a hard cap on **all** mobs was implemented. As the setup currently stands every 5 minutes all loaded chunks are scanned for mobs

The outcome of this test has been a much more stable server

#### Chaos ####

This follows on quite well from the previous point. As it is, we have expended all we can just keeping the other 3 up and operational. No ETA.

#### Lenth of downtime on crashes ####

There are currently 3 active tech admins. With Wraithguard01 working on heavy development of CommandHelper and Amaranthus on holidays we are doing all we can to cover the time zones

Steps are being taken at creating bots to automate the restarting of the server when a crash is noticed

#### Mob limits on S and P ####

As previously stated these limits are there to give us some measure of stability

#### Frequent spam attacks ####

As most S and C players will know we are quite popular for spammers

We are running low on funds to host all three of our Minecraft servers. In an effort to limit bandwidth and maximize server resources for Survival and PvE, the administrators ended up deciding unanimously that with our lack of money, P and S are the two servers which will remain running. Please complete your builds by this weekend; Creative will go down as soon as the new P and S revisions begin. A backup of the map will be available shortly after the server closes.

Survival and PvE will likely receive an influx of players after Creative is closed down. We encourage our regular P and S players to share their food and diamonds with any Creative immigrants who approach them. Bans will be issued to any players who accuse Creative players of 'taking over their server' or similar offenses

Additionally, it is unlikely that most of these players will be unbanned, as their lack of respect for the map proves them to be toxic players. A complete list of players who will be banned is available [here](http://tinyurl.com/26qgesb).

1) Reddit servers depend on several admin plugins written for the hMod platform




2) Minecraft was updated





3) hMod can't be updated. The code was written very poorly and is very outdated.




4) Bukkit is the future but currently it's not the present as it's unstable and incomplete with builds coming thick and fast as they work on getting it stable.




5) We're currently testing bukkit and several plugins including some plugins have been made by AllNaturalX and author blues.




6) There is a whole bunch of issues with using different version of the plugins and versions of bukkit that are causing hassle.

",2,146,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/thw20/in_one_week_may_18_pve_will_reset_to_a_new_map/,"That’s right! The time has come for PVE to get a new map. Over the past three months we’ve thoroughly explored and conquered Rev 7 and it’s been an incredibly fun experience. I hope you’re all proud not only of the stunning things you’ve built, but also the strong and supportive community you’ve helped to create. I know there will be many questions, I’ll cover the most common ones now and will try to answer any additional questions in the comments.

 
**When will the reset happen?**
In about a week

    
 
**What is the status of the current revision?**
The current rev is still alive and running. **All the rules (*such as no griefing*) continue to apply**. After the reset the map will be made available for download at [nerd.nu/backups](http://nerd.nu/backups). Use the next week to finish your projects and get things ready for the download. 

     

**What is a reset?**
When a map reaches the end of its life we take it down and replace it with an entirely new one. The old map is saved

    
 
**Why reset? I like this map the way it is.**
PVE maps generally last 2-3 months. The current (and seventh) revision started on February 19. We reset the map either when it breaks or when it gets old and activity levels drop. Three months is a long time to be playing on the same little patch of land and sea. A fresh map brings exciting new opportunities and gives everyone, diamondless equals. 

______________________________________________

Finally

It will be a 6000x6000 map made using the current vanilla terrain generation settings. There will be no resource plumping. Ore levels, ect will all be vanilla. Basically, to help ensure the map is stable, we didn’t mess with anything underground. Above ground is a different story, however. 

The surface of the map has been heavily modified with World Painter. Much of the ocean has been drained (though there is still plenty of water for those that want it) and you can now find extensive forests and plains stretching across the empty basin at level 45. Explorers will find massive mountains, and more. Additionally, the biome sizes have been increased dramatically. Imagine a desert that you could explore for many in game days and still not reach the edge. Vast jungles that stretch from the highest peaks to the depths of the former sea bed. A massive stinking swamp where the mooshrooms roam free. You’ll find it all on PVE Rev 8!

Hello

I wanted to give everyone a quick update on why PvE was still down right after the map reset, some assumed it was just the influx of players and chunk loading, but the tech admins soon suspected something more.

Initial probing found that the server was using far more memory than it should have been, and re-introduce them one by one in order to get to the heart of the memory problems. This process led him, and us, to believe that the source of our issues lie with WorldGuard trying to run far more processes than it should be, thus increasing memory load to the point of crash.

If that's really what the greater S community wants, but also want a certain level of maturity in how we use pvp.

As [Bukkit](https://twitter.com/EvilSeph/status/231613334351380482) and plugins continue to be a work in progress, we have worked out many of the planned changes for the new revisions, so now's as good a time as any to start announcing them.

Two things to keep in mind:

* This is not a complete list - more to come in a future Part 2. We haven't figured out what to do with all the new 1.3 features
* Nothing here is permanent. We're taking a wait-and-see attitude with many of the 1.3 changes to see how they work on a large server. Please bear with us until we can try them out (at which point feedback will be much appreciated!).

----

**The Planned Changes** (part 1)

* The **difficulty** of the S server is increasing to **hard**.
* **Map Sizes:** 6000x6000 worldpainted for C
* All new 1.3 **structures and world gen** will be incorporated as-is on S and P. Please note that player traps continue to be banned on P
* All **blocks** that are new to 1.3 will be allowed on all servers. Note that ender chests do not require LWC
* Rules for killing **passive mobs** (including all villagers and farm animals) are *not* changing on S or P. In particular
* **Villager trading** is planned to be incorporated as-is on S and P.
* We will be reverting to **vanilla XP** on S and P - with the 1.3 XP/enchanting changes there is effectively a 4x buff already, mob spawners). On P, make sure to protect any mob spawner you intend to use for grinders, etc.
* On S and P
* We intend to change **minecart behavior** to be the same as boats on S and P - that is,,False,,t5_2s52h,False,,True

1346639495.0,z9dcf,Mob farms are a problem on PvE. Here’s what we’re going to do about it.,strangestquark,54,3,57,"As you may or may not know

__________

**The Problem**

*1*) There are too many mobs. We have well over 10000 mobs

*2*) It is pretty much impossible to define in concrete terms what numbers are reasonable for a farm. It depends on need and purpose. It depends on how many people are allowed to use it. It depends on how many other farms are in the area. It depends on how often the chunk is loaded. There are a million things to consider. On top of that

*3*) The previous solution to this problem

_________________

**The Solution**

Quite simply

*Advantages to this approach*:

It’s humane. This allows us to try and take as many variables as possible into consideration. Farms that are actively used by large numbers of people (in a city for example) would be allowed to have more mobs than a private farm in the wilderness. It allows us to talk to people and figure out the situation before taking action. Basically

*Disadvantages*:

You have to trust us. Sure, Ooer, and I work hard day in and day out to provide a fair, fun, and friendly server for all of you to play on. I hope you can look at how we’ve conducted ourselves and how we’ve run the server and trust us to act as neutral arbiters. 

__________

**Additional changes to mob policy**

I would like to take this opportunity to announce that all farms must now make an effort to lock themselves to the general public. Farms should be protected and locked behind an iron door with a redstone torch. We will no longer be replacing animals unless they are griefed from a locked farm. 

The reason for this is because the logs are hard to read and search. There are many (on the order of dozens) of animal grief reqs every day. Each one can take 15-20 minutes to figure out and deal with. Frankly it’s too time consuming and stressful and we don’t want to deal with it anymore. None of the admins want to log on and spend all their free time searching through logs day in and day out. So we’re asking you to help us help you. Secure your animals. 

Keep in mind that although “the map is open for exploration” and we don’t allow people to create large inaccessible areas

___________

**TLDR**

We’re not allowing absurdly large animal farms anymore. Admins will be removing animals from farms that are too large. We’re asking you to trust our judgement. The alternative is a hard plugin enforced mob cap and no one wants that. 

Farms need to lock animals behind protection + iron door and redstone torch. We won’t replace animals lost to easily accessible farms

http://www.minecraftdl.com/reis-minimap-mod/

Ok, I've got just about every city (there are over 20 separate cities), EVERY nether portal (overworld and netherside), EVERY end portal, and every grinder I could find (I'm sure there's more), and additional landmarks (like Poseidon). 

If you're on the overworld map in the nether by the spawn portal then you're in this list,y, and z coordinates and I will add you. I've found the ""generic"" coordinates on the overworld map to be somewhat accurate, but also somewhat unreliable so hence one reason for this download. This is not a diss to UMC or Zuziza who put the map together but sometimes I had trouble locating a specific city (Necropolis, for example. Thanks to ZombieEater123 for the help in locating his city and end portal) due to non-exact coordinates. In fact, the overworld map was a HUGE help in this project so I commend everyone involved in the making of it. This is to be seen as merely an addition to their hard work.

I believe this to be an excellent tool for brand new people to the server, West, and North, in addition to their rail station and nether portal coordinates. So, if you're coming from the north to Seneca you'll find the Seneca North waypoint most applicable because that is the waypoint that was marked on the north border of Seneca and, it is marked on a north road going to Seneca. Some of the smaller cities only have one waypoint. I tried to mark most stuff due to easiest way to get there from the roads. Also, I personally traveled to each and every waypoint in this list to obtain maximum accuracy. The ""generic"" coordinates are good but they don't include the y coordinate which can get confusing sometimes

If I have gotten a coordinate wrong for your city, just message me here on reddit or in game and I will update this list. If you have a grinder or other landmark you want listed again, just message me here or in game but PLEASE include EVERY x,y,and z coordinate and I will add it or fix it. If I don't get all 3 coordinates this defeats the purpose of my list.

I organized the list in general by quadrant. You can install and rearrange the list if you wish by following the directions below:

To install coordinates:

1. Go to your .minecraft folder.
2. Click Mods folder
3. click the rei_minimap folder
4. Replace your p.nerd.nu.DIM0

OR

Open the p.nerd.nu.DIM0, DIM1 is The End, and DIM-1 is The Nether dimension. 

Copy and paste wanted waypoints into these files

You can also re-arrange the waypoints in notepad this way if you wish. Also

Also, we've got rivers that can actually be traveled via boat (as opposed to vanilla terrain), mountains that actually LOOK realistic, as well as highlighting the really cool stuff Minecraft can do, i.e. the Pico region. I sincerely hope we have a map this cool next revision and onward! Thanks again Thrawn!

I think I've covered everything. If not I'll post here. I really hope you all benefit from my hard work. Let me know if there is anything else I can do. If people find this helpful I plan on continuing this work for as many revisions I play on this server. Just let me know! Current version

So I'm not running on an alienware computer
    
When applying these settings
    
**Task Manager:**
    
To open task manager
    
Notice how you have some processes running without the actual program running? Sometimes programs like Chrome, not okay, or even if it's safe or not. Go through and end the processes that you don't need running. The processes ""dwm.exe"", ""explorer.exe"", and ""winlogon.exe"" should never be ended. Your cat will die if you end it.
    
Open Minecraft and log in. Then go back to your Task Manager Processes tab. You should see the process ""javaw.exe"". Right click it and set the priority to ""High"".
    
**Java**
    
Make sure you have the most current and correct version of running on your device. To check which version you have
    
    64 bit output:

    Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 23.6-b04
    

Next
    
If you have a 32 bit OS you should get the 32 bit output as seen above. If that is the case
   
For 64 bit computers only:
    
If you are running only the 32 bit Java on a 64 bit OS
    
If minecraft is running java out of \Program Files (x86)\ you are using 32 bit java for Minecraft and should do the following
     
* [Download and install](http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) both Java JRE for 32 and 64 bits. 64 should install to c:/program files and 32 to c:/program files (x86)
* Go to your path variables by typing ""system path variables"" into your start search. The first option is ""Edit the system environment variables""
* Open that up and go to the advanced tab. Click on ""Environment Variables...""
* Under the bottom half of that window is the System variables. Scroll down to Path and select it. Click edit.
* Make sure that both bin directories are in there. It should look something like this on the end of the current variable value. 
    
    ;C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\bin C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin;
    
* Hit OK for each of the three screens open
    
To verify that everything is working correctly, go to Google and do some research. Open up Minecraft and log in. Open your Task Manager with CTRL + SHIFT + ESC and under the Processes tab right click on javaw.exe and go to properties. If you are running 64 bit java for minecraft it should read ""C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin"" under the location.
    
**Allocating more RAM to Minecraft**
    
Here is a great [tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QttgiVI97R0) that explains why allocating more ram is important and how to do it. Please note that allocating more ram **may** make you have lower fps. Test it out and see first. To see how much RAM you have in the first place hit Win + R and type ""dxdiag.exe"" again. Click ""OK"". Under Memory is the amount of RAM you have. [Example](http://i.imgur.com/71Dw7LB.png)
    
I wouldn't set the max heap to 100% of physical RAM
You can use the 'g' suffix to indicate gigabytes. For example
    
If you're running a 32-bit system
Default sizes are system-dependent and determined at runtime. Don't just plug things into the command line and expect instant results. Do reasonably good experiments and track your results. 
    
**Allocate more RAM to Java**
    
~~Open your Control Panel and click Java. Select the Java tab and click view. Under Runtime Parameters there will probably be a blank field. Enter in ""-Xmx**RAM**m"" with **RAM** being the amount of ram you have. Refer to dxdiag.exe to find the number that you should use. Here is my [dxdiag](http://i.imgur.com/71Dw7LB.png)

    
**Optifine**
    
Check out the minecraftforum.net post for [optifine](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/249637-147-optifine-hd-b4-fps-boost-hd-textures-aa-af-and-much-more/). Follow all the instructions on there and remember to **back up** your .minecraft folder so you can revert back. Just copy and paste it to your desktop. If you don't download correctly or something kills Minecraft

[Here](http://pastebin.com/fp6hQ3Qs) are the settings that I have for optifine. Under video settings
    
**Magic Launcher**
    
""One thing I would add is (if possible) for people to use the [Magic Launcher](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/939149-launcher-magic-launcher-100-mods-options-news/): it makes it very convenient for installing multiple mods (it makes it so much easier for me to upgrade REIS mini map + optifine) when there's an update
    
I don't know how this program works with my other fixes as I have not tested it. Magic Launcher has a setting for adjusting the amount of allocated RAM

**Computer management**
    
If you have a lot of files on your computer
    
Open your temp folder by hitting Win + R and typing %temp% and clicking ""OK"". Go ahead select all the files and delete them. Skip over files that are being used by another program.

Lastly
    
Laptops: In your power settings make sure it is set to Max Performance and not balanced or power saver
    
Also try running Minecraft in fullscreen mode. ne0codex suggested it and I did get about 10 more fps when I tried it.

**We will be resetting all three of our servers - c.nerd.nu, the current revision for all three servers will immediately end. A new revision will begin on each server once all of our servers and plugins are updated.

I'm sure there will be a lot of questions related to this announcement - we'll address the main questions below

----

**The servers reset when 1.3 is released - but when will 1.3 be released?** It's up to Mojang, August 1st.**

**What is the status of the current revision?** The current revisions are all still alive and running. *All rules (such as no griefing) continue to apply.* After the servers are reset

**What is a reset?** We take down the current map and replace it with an entirely new one. The replacement map for each server will be completely new terrain, nothing is carried over.

**Will the new revisions launch the moment 1.3 comes out?** No - we can't launch our new revisions until CraftBukkit and all of our plugins are updated. This could be hours or it could be days, we'll announce everything as it happens.

**So what happens while we wait for the new revisions?** Once 1.3 is launched, and may be occasionally reset, though stability should improve as we get more familiar with 1.3 over time.  Join the chaos and explore 1.3 with your friends!

**Will we be able to use (insert 1.3 feature here) on the servers??** We won't know for sure exactly what 1.3 looks like until it launches

**Give me more details about the new (C

It does two things: lets you know how much time has elapsed since the last crash/restart (protip: restarts are roughly every 2 hours) and lets you see the player count without having to constantly spam the refresh button in Minecraft.

The actual server contact is limited to the single server list ping packet, this should *reduce* the packet traffic).

This should work for any Nerd.Nu Minecraft server (see [http://minecanary.com/#/u/c.nerd.nu](http://minecanary.com/#/u/c.nerd.nu)

1333812298.0,rxx14,[PvE] Ultimate Lottery!,MinecraftMan1,59,14,145,"[So today

So

How the lottery works will be like this: I've built a redstone game in Melonville where people guess which grass block will survive under stone for the longest time possible (The death of each block is detected by a BUD and indicated by the turning off of a redstone torch). There are five grass blocks overall.

The blocks are number 1-5 from left to right. Since the order of the deaths are completely random

**Rules:**

Each person gets two picks. This is what you do: Get the numbers 1, 4 and 5 and create a number out of them. The same number cannot be repeated twice. Legitimate numbers include 15324, 42135, while 22514 and 33333 are not. There are 120 possible combinations overall, so if 60 people compete, there will be no more numbers left. Leave a comment in this post stating the numbers you choose, your in-game name, and the coords to your base if you want me to trek a long way and deliver the diamonds to you.

ENTRIES ARE FREE

**ENTRIES CLOSE AT 11:59PM, 2011, AUSTRALIAN EASTERN STANDARD TIME (MELBOURNE). This is Monday 8:59am US Central Time, Monday 1:59pm GMT, Monday 7:29pm in Calcutta. I'm not responsible for anything if you can't convert time zones. Use a tool online or something.**

This lottery is only available to players who actually play on PvE. I'm not giving you 64 diamonds on Survival.

To make it fair: If nobody wins the lottery

No two players can select the same number twice. :)

eg:  if you do /check
#1. [OPEN] Mar.14@19.43.54 by Deaygo - can you make this water flow?
#2. [OPEN] Mar.14@20.00.00 by Deaygo - I found some grief

If you don't want the water to flow anymore you can type /done 1 and that will tell the mods that you don't need that request anymore.

The time has come to reset the PVE map. This second map has had an excellent run, but it's time to move on. This is not a sudden decision. We've been talking about it internally for some time. We've listened to the general chatter in-game, on mumble, and IRC to gauge whether this is the right decision, and we feel it is.

I know this announcement will be met with a spectrum of reactions. Some of you are in the middle of new projects and it seems heartless of us to reset the map right in the middle of that. Some of you stopped playing weeks ago and have been ready for a map reset for some time now. The unfortunate truth is there's never a good time to reset the map. For those of you who are just starting new projects, brand new project when a map reset was announced, so believe me, I do understand.

But

Not long after the reset, you will want to make sure lava flow and fire spread are turned *off*. Otherwise, your world will burn. [(Spawn would look like this.)](http://imgur.com/a/VPhFT)

I will be happy to answer questions on why's and wherefor's of the reset in the comments



**WHAT TO DO DURING THE NEXT WEEK**

Starting immediately

Take screenshots! Shoot video! Document as much as you can and get it posted for people to see! Some people on the other nerd.nu servers have *never* been to PVE. Let them see what they've been missing.



**WHAT TO EXPECT WITH THE NEW MAP**

Believe it or not

* An even more ""epic"" landscape
* Plumped ores
* Iron now reaches all the way up to level 76
* Redstone veins have been reduced slightly. Its use is limited in SMP and the amount available will easily faciliate the needs for interesting projects
* Gold has been increased ever so slightly to accomodate the increased need for gold in boosters.
* Flowers
* Higher trade rates. The current rate is 3 diamonds per nether block. The new rate will be 4 diamonds per nether block. (The rate on the first map was 5 diamonds per nether block.) The rates reflect the relative ore plumping.
* More mobs. This is a side-effect of the more epic landscape. It won't be as bad as the first map
* Lava flow will be back on.



**THE PLAN**

Exact details are still being worked out with the tech admins, and then opening up the server to the users.



**GET STARTED!**

Please! Go take screenshots, I'm way more impressed with what I see *every day* on the PVE server. Let's show people!",,False,,t5_2s52h,False,,moderator

The 17th s.nerd.nu map will go live at roughly the same time as p.nerd.nu's new map.

Some notable changes:

- 4 portals on the roads.
- 6 warp signs at spawn
- you can exit spawn via drop - you don't have to use the warps if you don't want to.
- significantly expanded protections around warp &amp; portal points.
- ice strips on the center of every road for faster travel and interesting jousting.
- warps are now at each 500
- the server is now on HARD difficulty (you can starve to death and zombies can break down wooden doors

As usual: any problems with protections or the map need to be swiftly reported to an admin and we'll take care of it!

* There is mild plumping over **all** of the map. I varied the ore plumped by biome:

&gt; Extreme Hills: Redstone

&gt; Jungle: Iron and Coal

&gt; Ocean: Lapis

As you may have seen [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/19ukum/the_redstone_update_15_will_be_released_on/), the 1.5 [Redstone Update](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Redstone_Update) patch will be going live next Wednesday, on [March 13th](http://mojang.com/2013/03/minecraft-redstone-update-pre-release/). With that in mind, it's time for us to announce our plans for the patch! In particular:

* **p.nerd.nu** (P) and **s.nerd.nu** (S) will be **ending their current revisions** when the 1.5 patch comes out
* **c.nerd.nu** (C) will be **staying on its current revision** through the update to 1.5 - **no reset planned**.
* As has become tradition

I'll leave it to the server admins to announce their plans for the new revs (and the end of the current ones) - I will just say that we have some really exciting changes in store for the community :)

----

Now

* **So what happens when the patch comes out?** We'll end the current revisions of P and S, at chaos.nerd.nu. C will stay exactly as is, running 1.4 - so hang on to your current .jars so you can keep playing there.

* **How long will it take to update the servers?** It depends. We have to wait for new versions of Bukkit and our external plugins to come out, or a week or more. We'll make sure to keep you guys updated (usually by posting a spreadsheet showing our progress).

* **Okay, depending on the load on the other servers.

* **What does a server reset mean?** It means we wipe the map, build/fight with a new group, or get to work on that dream project of yours.

* **What if I want to keep building on the current rev?** We always put up copies of retired revisions up for download at [nerd.nu/backups](http://nerd.nu/backups)

* **Will we get to use (insert 1.5 feature here) on the servers?** We can't say for sure yet - we'll have to see what the patch looks like when the final version comes out, it may take us a while to figure out how to get hoppers/droppers to play nice with LWC.)

* **It's a Redstone Update - can we do a redstone building contest??** YES! Still figuring out when and where would be the best place to do it

Thirty-four days later, especially since the new update is already running on chaotic S?  Well, for most of the time since 1.6.2 was updated, we were waiting on plugins.  Once those were done, there were some issues presented by the new content (mostly related to horses) that we wanted to sort out before the server update, the solutions to which can be found below.

For this new PvE update

**Horses:**

We will be seeding horses pseudo-randomly across the map for players to find and tame.  **Horse accessibility will initially be restricted as wolves and ocelots are; that is, use /unlock-horse and right-click on your horse, and anyone will be able to ride it.  To undo this and restrict riding permissions to only you again, use /lock-horse and right-click on your horse.**

Since this was generated on 1.5.2, when generated, will actually have horse armor on the map), but for now, enjoy these recipes and keep your horses safe!

Also for this rev only

**Nametags:**

None of the dungeons on this map contain nametags, now's your chance to try it out!  Same goes if you want to keep around a mob not named Grumm or Dinnerbone, though we take no responsibility for any less-than-dramatic results that occur.

Please note that your names must comply with P chat rules (including but not limited to: no homophobia, and we reserve the right to remove or rename any mob that does not.

That's it!  Apologies again for the long delay in updating to 1.6.2, comments, concerns you have about this update.

----

Hellooooo everybody!

With map preparation finalised, the only thing that might delay or hold us back is one of the admins falling ill or otherwise being unable to make it unexpectedly. If something comes up we'll let you know as soon as possible, but we're not waiting on anything in particular to get this revision up and running.

However, and it would have been an unfair amount of short notice to spring the new revision on you *this* weekend.

Chaos events will be ongoing on s.nerd.nu until then

----
**General details about the upcoming revision**

----
- Map size will be the standard **4000x4000** (i.e. from -2000 to +2000 on both the X and Z axes)
- We're running with the **four cardinal roads** this map
- Roads are protected up to **25 blocks** above and on average **5 blocks** below their surface. Roads are protected much further down in the ocean biome(s), but only around **6 blocks** below their surface. Similarly, we'll monitor any cases where it seems people might be abusing the protections offered by these areas.

----
**Changes being brought in with the new revision**

----
- **Enchantism** - Currently setup and working perfectly fine on the chaos events
- **PvPTimer** - We'll hold off on bringing this on board until at least a few days after the map launch, players who have first joined the server will have (an optional, they can turn it off if they choose) **1 hour** of gameplay free from PvP. PvPTimer also comes with an option for protection upon respawn - we'll be keeping this as well unless there's any serious concern with it.
- **Rebalance Villagers** has apparently been facing some issues. Per totemo, we'll progress with vanilla-style villagers.
- Crafting recipes for horse armour and saddles should hopefully be available upon map launch
- **Creeper spawners** - An idea suggested a short while ago, and i've tried to ensure a reasonable distribution in each of the four quadrants of the map. I can't guarantee which abandoned mineshafts out of all of them will be discovered, so the numbers i've replaced are done with that in mind.
- We've dropped the 5 minute timer on despawning carts

----
**Things that aren't changing/will carry over into the new revision**

----
- Your clan chat should still work fine from the previous revision
- Books will still only require 3 paper to be crafted.
- PlumpXP will still be in effect
- Armoured head drops will continue to be in effect.
- Any additional changes similar to this can be found listed on the **second floor** of the spawn building.


----
**Some pointers for the first day of the revision**

----
- To combat the concerns of a complicated spawn setup whilst maintaining that we do need the additional floors to hold information relevant to newer players, and into the PvP-enabled zone. This is to make sure that people using the warp signs aren't given a massive advantage on the first day over those that prefer to walk their way down, as well as to give a second chance to those that might have accidentally clicked the sign.
- **Land claims** - Bolded because it's a hassle *every* revision, so please, in the interest of freeing up the workload for us and making things easier on everyone involved - **talk to the person you're contesting the land claim with first** and see if you can't come to a resolution between yourselves. Getting a moderator involved often means we'll check the LogBlock timestamps of whoever placed what first, and more often than not all we'll end up doing is separating your claims down the middle if they overlap. Please try to be reasonable with one another if you end up having claim issues, and please make a modreq rather than personally message a moderator if you need it to be resolved on your behalf. Modreqs go into a queue, and we handle them in the order they come in.

Hopefully i've covered what needs to be said about this upcoming revision, so chances are i've forgotten something completely obvious. Some additional interesting ideas about changes have been thrown about behind the scenes in the past couple of days that we could consider bringing onto Survival with this upcoming revision, but i've held off from mentioning them until there's anything concrete there. I'll be keeping everyone up to date with any further changes, both here and on the forums!

Wanted to give everyone an update on where we stand with the servers and our plans to launch new revisions of S and P.

First off, and in an effort for the datacenter to preserve uninterrupted services for other users, our servers had to be taken offline for a period of time. During this time, the servers were coming up and going down fairly often, as you probably noticed. As it was a pretty unstable situation, we didn't want to post that things were back up until we were sure things had stabilized again.

That is now the case

A side effect of the downtime is that it slowed our progress a bit in getting everything updated for 1.5. Regardless

This timeframe is still subject to change, which is not ideal, and as of this morning some of the external plugins we rely on for P and S are still definitely broken. But we'll be aiming for a weekend launch throughout this week, determining whether everything is sufficiently working to proceed.

Ever since I first joined MCPublic early of Rev 13. (Feb 2011) It was my first time on a public server. I have had the pleasure to meet some fantastic people on the servers. Sure, you guys have helped me overcome some serious life challenge that I have suffered through. Up until I joined the servers, I had never had “real” friends before, you guys were so welcoming and caring about me and welcomed me in open arms. I never felt any since or fear of intimidation from anyone. One of my first friends was Marting11. When I was a MC noob he helped me with my shitty redstone contraption I tried to make. After he was finished he showed me around the map. Taking the CTA rails around the server was amazing. To see these magnificent works of art you guys built.

Since then


* Verros- From The Netherbox to Dome5 to The Big Ignuf, JernAdams1735, imwoood etc.) And for that I thank you for bring me and the server as a community together through the numerous community events you have hosted in the past, and I hope there are many more to come.


* Skylord_Char- Oh god, I had never really talked to someone else online before. But when I first heard you and your English accent and just general goofiness, you just put those fears away. Since then, you have been a remarkable not only friend, but mentor to me weather you knew that or not. Mentor, when my home exploded in May of last year. I had nothing. I was devastated. Hopefully you remember this but I went on mumble later the week of the incident and was so freaked but you talked me down, and actually gave me a few laughs in a time where laughs were pretty much all I had.

Today


* John(*Jern*)Adams1735- Damn. From the first time you joined and helped me build my shitty little town

From the beginning, you were always happy to help. Now, as a head admin, you have the get done attitude while still holding onto the personal aspect of server life, you always seem so approachable about whatever needs talking about. Which, really, was not always fair I went to you about everything. But no matter what it was, and you took appropriate action. I haven’t always been fair to you in the past


* To all past and present staff- Im going to be very blunt here. **THANK YOU** for putting up with this shit for as long as you have. To sacrifice your time and energy into something that your not being payed to do, it was completed in a timely manner. But modreqs are just a fraction of what you have to worry about as im sure you know. From ban appeals to just making sure the servers run like clock work. Through the highs and lows, you made sure the community chugs through like a steaming locomotive.


* Everyone else not mentioned- Wow. What a great group of people. Hopefully I have had the chance to meet and chat with you a bit (if I haven’t yet PM me :D). You guys have been great friends of mine ever since day one. I’ve never found a server quite like this one with such a great user base. You guys are the important thing. Without you, modreq it, thats why if someone needs a hand with something, you lend a hand. **YOU** practically control the server. So I hope when the next revs come out you will lend a hand to one another, and continue to be the thriving server base we were and still are today.

After almost two years of working on Brom and its various franchises I’ve decided it’s time to branch out and try something new. I’m going to follow my dream of building roads to connect the towns and cities of the server and I hope you’ll join me!

The RBA will be supportive

_____________

**Why roads?**

When I first joined the server as a newbie many moons ago I got my start by walking the player made roads out of spawn. I found a nice spot half way down the East Road and built a house. Not long after I started making friends in the neighborhood and haven’t looked back since. 

I feel that roads are far more accessible to newbies than the rail system (though I do agree that the rails are extremely important) or nether. Even a poor, roads encourage exploration and make it easier to meet new people. 


**What’s the plan?**

Our initial priority will be to connect cities and towns to spawn and to each other. Ideally we would like to partner with cities on individual projects and arrange some sort of resource sharing. However

The road designs will be simple, crafting, food, and other amenities. 

Our first project will be connecting the city of Pico (or

______________

Once the map launches we’ll head out with the Pico folks as they hunt for a spot. Once they’re established we’ll start blazing a trail back to spawn. The eventual RBA headquarters will be somewhere on the road between Pico and spawn. Once the Pico road is up and running we’ll start on projects to other cities that may be interested. 

**Updates and additional discussion will be found at /r/pveroads**

Here's how it's setup:

* No /give
* No /tp, etc just like survival
* WorldGuard protections are disabled, obsidian is placeable, fire burninates, and TNT explodinates.
* PVP is turned on globally
* There are no protected areas at all
* Because this is chaos
* Regarding the rules - there pretty much are none.  Except racism
* We reserve the right to disable stuff that lags the server too bad and makes it unplayable for the masses.
* The lack of rules applies to the mods / admins also
* The map should be considered *volatile*.  We can reset it at any time, we will.
* There won't be backups, it takes last priority over the existing creative and survival servers.
* Do not message the mod chat with chaos server issues.
* This is hosted in Denmark
* **Edit:** Client hacks are not permitted.  Those caught using hacks will be asked to stop

And one final note.  While we know people have been screaming for a PvE only server, and as such we want proper hosting in the same datacenter as creative and survival.  This is on our todo list, but hardware must first be acquired.  Be assured we are working on it.

1292531149.0,en07t,What to expect during the map reset on the 20th,sirmalloc,41,4,33,"In anticipation of the upcoming Minecraft Beta release on the 20th

First things first - before the reset, we will do one final backup of the creative and survival maps and then open them up for a TNT party.  The backups will be posted to [nerd.nu/maps](http://nerd.nu/maps) at some point during the day.  Cuboid protections will be turned off, chest protection will be disabled, and TNT will be enabled.  We are still banning fire, lava, and water mainly for the fact that when they are mass-spammed, any users in the area will get knocked off the server and be unable to join in the griefing.  Be aware that massive TNT explosions have a tendency to crash your client

When the beta is released, we will setup a vanilla server at c.nerd.nu running a fresh map and **no plugins**.  This means no /give, /tp, /warp or any other commands that hey0 and it's plugins provide.  This will be a **temporary map**.  All the existing mods and admins will be ops on the server and can give you items, teleport you, etc at their discretion.

At this point, we'll need to test compatibility of the plugins that we utilize: WorldGuard, Cuboid, Borderlands, and GriefAlert being the most important.  The technical admins will be on Mumble during this phase of testing, and will possibly enlist the help of others on Mumble to test.

Once we have a stable hey0 server up and running with our usual plugins, until then, don't get too attached as it could be reset at any time.

First thing they notice is the portal to The End closes. Huh, we'll just build it over the location of an old one. Except it doesn't work. No End Portal. No limitless supply of easy enchantments and XP.

The next thing that happens mobs can now destroy blocks. The Withers caged up around the world break free, and anyone that had them on a private estate... Well, I'm sure we can rebuild in time...

But we've got other problems. Creepers are spawning more and more frequently, the worst ones dump the unfortunate miners into a cavern full of monsters or pit of lava. Ouch. It gets harder and harder to move around as the days go on, and people have to bring stacks of tracks with them wherever they go to repair the damaged railway. Except the mobs keep coming, with greater and greater frequency. But that's just in the Overworld, the Nether still connects all the cities.

Except the next thing that happens is all the Nether portals erupt in explosions of lava, as more mobs descend on the players, hounding them into their houses.

The next worst thing to happen is all the beds disappear. We can no longer spawn near our caches of weapons, to try and trudge through a nightmare hellscape of broken tracks and burning, empty cities. It's like a scene out of The Road, players scavenging the most basic of blocks, hoarding iron and coal like diamonds.

But there is a rumour, and are rebuilding. The thing is: They have the last bed on the server. They can respawn as soon as they fall in battle to plug the walls before Creepers and skeletons can make it into the main fortress. Groups of players start a migration, away from spawn, carrying seeds and potatoes, wearing leather armor like refugees from Mad Max and trying to coax along stubborn livestock with the promise of wheat. Weapons are crude, stone swords mostly but a few players have enough flint for arrows. Many fall on the exodus to be sent back to spawn, their gear scooped up by the surviving players. Some wait for their friends to rejoin the group, quitting the server in frustration. Those who continue on bring much needed supplies and manpower to the fledgling fortress.

Then the final apocalyptic event: All crafting tables vanish, for now. Every able bodied avatar is armed as best they can scrounge. Maybe a few heroes still carry enchanted bows with infinite enchantments, and the glint of unbreaking diamond swords can be picked out amongst the gloom along the ramparts. But the nights are growing longer, things are breaking apart, and the crops are having a hard time growing in the snow.

Then one night, relatively safe. Except from over a hill they heard a sound nobody on the server had heard in days. Withers. Four of them. The scouts ran all the way back to the fortress. The Withers followed hot on their heels, and death followed the four Withers. Skeletons and Creepers mob the walls and gates, the defenders throwing everything they've got at the small army of hostiles.

Clever traps help thin the numbers, picking off one or two players here and there but the majority are dying from the Withering barrage. Finally, the archers manage to bring down two of the three headed boss mobs, another going down to a lucky elevated fellow and his sword. But the last one is tearing apart the settlement, crops and livestock are blown to shreds as people run everywhere, trying to bring it down, but not before it destroys the last bed on the server. Those who die fighting it respawn impossibly far away, a single crafting table appears beside it's corpse

Someone digs out twelve cubes of Obsidian, all the tools are shattered, all the crops are gone, and the livestock is scattered or blown to hamburger. But those four beacons blaze into the sky for the rest of the day, and when night falls and the monsters descend on the ruins they find no players. If they are capable of coherent thought, they might wonder at the four beacons left behind, blazing in the night like perfect falling stars.",False,pve,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/1jemry/how_the_world_could_end/

There has been a lot of back and forth on the use of Cuboid.

Overview: Cuboid is a tool that allows the user to edit the terrain and create walls of blocks simply by selecting the two endpoints.

In the near future there will be two servers; a creative server

The survival server **will not** have cuboid. It will also not have item spawning or teleportation.

This thread is regarding the creative server. The biggest argument against cuboid has been that it takes away from the survival aspect. So, this decision only affects the creative server.

Here is my suggestion: Due to it's destructive potential, replacing blocks, and creating walls. Now obviously, if a structure is created entirely of cuboid, it is pointless. A structure that took no creativity or imagination to build is pointless, and does undermine the point of ""Creative"" mode. But, this is the case for any silly structure built, cuboid can simply be a time saver. It allows you to complete tedious tasks quickly, we're already ""cheating"".

(For all those familiar with Cuboid functions, Faces, and Walls commands will not be allowed. Simply too easy to screw up. See my [Cuboid Tutorial here](http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/dpx0n/official_server_welcome_and_tutorial/).)

The thing I want to prevent is people taking the time to create large iron grinders and then having to shut them down because the number of villagers causes too much lag (villagers are excluded from the mob plugin). To prevent this happening

1. Set a hard limit to the number of pods a city could have in their iron grinder

2. Once a city has produced a 15 pod grinder

3. Once a city has produced a single functional pod

4. Do no policy on the issue right now

**Mob cap**: Hopefully we can get rid of the mob cap. We will see the return of normal farms, be responsible with your farms. 

**Player cap**: We're aiming for well over 100 (I'm hoping for 150ish) players with minimal lag and no crashing. Everyone who wants to play should be able to get in.

Up until last Friday.....since then it has been a dicksplosion. 

Friday my friend was toiling away in the mines clearing out some diamonds. Out of nowhere a townie from next door runs up and mines them right out from under her. I know the mines are public but she cleared the way to the vein and it was clear she was actively working on it. She got upset

Saturday she logs in with a fresh attitude ready to build! She quickly finds out she can no longer build in her already established base because the same town that ganked the diamonds has been given protection on it. The solution was to give her access, I wasn't there to witness it but I'm pretty sure her [head exploded.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HY-03vYYAjA)  Why was this protection granted in the first place? It was obvious the town had not built anything on the land, isn't that a requirement? Did the mod who granted it not come out to even look at what they were granting? 

Now for my own thrilling sob story! Yesterday, my fault I admit. They had two choices, ask me if it was public or take my stuff and log before I could talk to them. They chose to take my stuff and log. How is that not being a dick, how is that not a violation of the Golden Rule of the servers? Instead of taking the law into my own hands I put in a /modreq which was closed without so much as a /msg to me. 

I was guide for Everquest so I understand being a mod is usually a thankless (sometimes hated

**We plan on these changes going live this Friday

One of our goals in running the PvE server is to provide an experience that is as close to vanilla Minecraft as is practical. Recent technical advances have enabled us to take a few steps in that direction. I'll run down each of the changes and provide details as to how things will work. 

---------

***-/home and beds-***

Our tech admins have managed to get beds working as they are supposed to. That means that we no longer need the /home command and it will be disabled. Although we have all got used to using /home to get around

Beds will work exactly as in single player. To set your spawn: get in the bed at night and wait until the screen fades, but don't count on that ever happening. There will be a brief period (a week or so) where /home and beds are both active to allow people to get things all set up. 

---------

***-Water/Lava buckets-***

The bucket testing is going well on survival and we feel ready to implement it on PvE. Here's how it will work:

-You have to gather water or lava in a bucket like in single player. You can place the source block

-If you need flowing water/lava

-Mods will no longer place water/lava for things like farms, ect. 

-**PVP with lava is strictly prohibited**. This includes placing lava next to someone to hurt them, so please be good. 

---------

***-Nether-***

Just a reminder

The trade signs have been fixed. After this new nether has been picked clean we will set up one or more nether trade signs at spawn. Exact pricing will be determined at that time. 

Hopefully this will be the last nether reset. Once the trade signs are set up and the nether is stable we will start doing protections there again. Until an announcement is made,,False,,t5_2s52h,True,,True

[Server load diagram](http://i.imgur.com/QXM2h.jpg) - 8 is 100% (roughly speaking)

With load averages well over our capacity

To combat this, resulting in a *freezing* type affect on game play that many of you will now be familiar with. 

The results of the profiling precipitated a rewrite of SafeBuckets

We also tuned some plugin configurations, but for the most part it has come down, meaning we are steps closer to launching Creative again!

Over the coming days we will continue to profile the servers and speed things up where possible. We avoid affecting game play where possible

I am sorry to say we have a *lot* of work to do in order to launch Creative. We need to get the server load to a manageable form and once again update NerdBukkit to remove all growth from the server ( *Both as an anti-griefing tactic and as a removal of a resource intensive portion of game play not needed* ). The map has been ready for a while but we just haven't had the capacity to run it :(

While we are all getting annoyed that Creative is slow to launch I hope this provides some measure of insight into why we have been taking so long. We are honestly worried that launching another server will not only just be a lagged out server nobody can play on, as the issues may be fixed at any point rendering the new hardware redundant, and the increase in monthly spend is not something to be taken lightly.

Once you've made a modreq to get a region protected

1. Region Owners can now add members to their regions using the the command:

            /region addmember REGIONNAME USERNAME1 USERNAME2 ... 
    
2. Region owners can remove members using the following:

            /region removemember REGIONNAME USERNAME1 USERNAM2 ... 
    
3. Region owners can add additional owners using the following:

Region members will have full access to edit inside of a given region (say, but owners are able to add and remove members as well as add owners. If you want an owner removed, you must still make a modreq to do so. This setup is much like how subreddits are moderated, where you can't have a coup to overthrow town mayors.

The main reason we went with vanilla terrain in Rev 9 was to see if somehow modified terrain was impacting server performance. In the end the tech admins determined that modified terrain in and of itself doesn't do anything to slow the server down. Rather

This will be a very special map with a unique generation scheme. The center of the map from 0, it will be flat and tame. 

From +/-1000 to +/-2000 the map will consist of unique terrain generated by the Terrain Control mod. There will be massive jaw dropping land formations and sky islands. This is the type of terrain that the PvE server was started on and that we most recently were able to enjoy in Rev 7. 

_________

**Ores and plumping**: 

The center portion of the map with the vanilla generation will have vanilla ore levels and distribution. 

The outer portion of the map with the TC terrain will feature ore plumping. The exact nature of the plumping will vary depending on biome. We'll leave the details to you guys to discover but some examples are:

-Iron and coal can be found from bedrock all the way to the tops of the highest land formations and sky islands in all TC biomes.

-Extreme hills biomes in TC terrain have emeralds up to the top of the mountains and diamonds up to y50.

-Jungle biomes in TC terrain can have lapis

Caves in the TC terrain are essentially the same as vanilla. 

__________

**Portal placement**:

The portals will be in the corners again, who knows. 

__________

**Spawn**:

Spawn will be a single building surrounded by simple landscaping at sea level. The portal and train station are visible from and right next to the exit from the rules. 

__________

**Mob policy**:

We've been testing c45y's new mob management plugin on the server over the past few days. Testing has gone extremely well. The plugin is amazing! It will be active in Rev 10 with the current settings. Any changes to the config will be announced in game and [on the wiki](http://redditpublic.com/wiki/Pve_Mob_Plugin).

If you'd like to see an image of where we are now you can take a look at the TODO list on the wiki. http://redditpublic.com/wiki/Todolist

Here is a status of all the servers.


* **Creative**: *Up and running*. Some minor tweaking of plugins needed.


* **Chaos**: *Up and running*. Needs a few not-so-minor changes to be truly chaotically fun.


* **PvE**: *Not up*. Needs to have a creeper nerf plugin working (i.e. creepers can't blow up spawn/protected areas) also /home is broken.
After this we could probably roll it out. All we'd REALLY need is the creeper nerf which is coming.

* **Survival**: *Not Up*. As well as the above it also needs to be marked out for seperate pve areas too possibly.


What I'm looking for though here is suggestions. The only two servers currently operating are chaos and creative. What are they missing? What's wrong with them? Any and all suggestions considered



My Goal is to have the four servers running and stable by at most this day week. I've written some (very poor) plugins to help and AllNaturalX has worked his butt off too so thanks for your patience and we'll be back online as quick as we can.


In the mean time try out chaos or creative.

During high usage times we regularly run at 4-9 ticks per second while the ideal is 18-20. This makes everything run at a quarter the speed it should thus making movement

It seems obvious a large part of this lag is caused by players idling in experience grinders letting massive numbers of mobs build up so they can kill them all at once to gain levels. Just today a player sat in a blaze mob grinder long enough to make 600 blazes spawn and kill any client that came close. That many mobs also has a large effect on server lag.

So, it just means you'll have to actually kill them as they spawn rather than idling waiting for them to build up.

I'm working on other ways to get profiling data from the server and fix performance issues in both the server and our plugins.

1324601173.0,nnbhg,[PvE] Rules Update - Effective Immediately,strangestquark,36,5,8,"Hi everyone

I'll post all the new parts below

---------

Updates to PvE common rules:

* Be a good neighbor

* Any building scaffolding or access structures such as tard towers (towers that are only a single block wide) should be removed when no longer necessary. Permanent scaffolding or tard towers are frowned upon and may be removed by staff. Long-incomplete structures that are in the way may be removed at the discretion of server admins. 

* Be respectful of the map and do not mar the experience or view for other players. Certain “very low quality” structures including but not limited to cobble/netherrack boxes and floating skyrails may be removed if they significantly impact the surrounding area in a negative way. Such removal will be done entirely at the discretion of server admins. 

* The map should be considered open for exploration. Players are not allowed to completely block off large sections of the map. Access to land and buildings should not be ""restricted"". Anything can be explored by anyone. Rare exceptions include structures such as private animal farms.

---------

Clarifications regarding the Nether/End

* All server rules still apply in the Nether and End. 

* The End should be considered volatile and could be reset at any time. Don’t store blocks or items in the End that you don’t want to lose. 

* The Nether may be reset from time to time. We will try to give several days’ notice before a Nether reset

* Due to the possibility of resets

--------

Clarifications regarding protections

* Protections serve two distinct purposes:
* (1)To prevent unauthorized edits to player made structures and other builds (this includes strongholds and NPC villages significantly improved or worked on by the player). 
* (2)To control the development of a town or city

* Protections are not used for “claiming land.” Mods will only protect builds (houses, ect) and clearly established cities. Requests to protect empty land or to protect a very large buffer around a structure will be denied.

* Protections generally will cover the entire area above a structure (to sky limit) and about 10 blocks below the lowest floor.
* We will not protect to bedrock unless your structure extends down that far. Underground resources are considered to be public property. Mines, will not be protected.

I do want to make it clear we are not attempting to completely change minecraft.  What we ARE trying to do is encourage pvp by making competitive level gear easier to get and more rewarding to use.  As of right now there are no huge changes to the game; instead there are fairly large tweaks that we feel will help in that regard. 

These will be going live in the coming days.  I will make another post when they do.  I just figured we'd throw it all out there before hand to give everyone the heads up. 


* We will be reintroducing XP plumping.  Everything will drop 2-3x more XP than it does right now (we're not sure on exact numbers yet...).  This will make obvious effects by halving or thirding the time it takes to get your XP to level 30.  

* C45Y will be implementing an unenchant command.  Hold the item in your hand you want unenchanted and type /unenchant into the chat box.  

* C45Y also made it so enderpearls will now always do 2.5 hearts of damage no matter what armor you're wearing.  This is to discourage (or make it impossible in some cases) to pearl away from fights or spam pearls in all directions.  It doesn't remove pearling

* Yours truly implemented a glicko2 (www.glicko.net/glicko/glicko2.pdf) rating system for survival seeded with every kill from the revision and updated pseudo live, and All kills rank for each player.  C45Y has built a very nice sortable leaderboard with that data and some additional goodies that will be put onto nerd.nu.

To put things into perspective, PvE often has over 12,000 mobs plus 2000+ items on the ground. It's just too much for the server to deal with. This is the main limiting factor with regards to lag (ticks per second) and player capacity. 

In the interest of (hopefully) getting more people on the server and in drastically improving performance we're implementing a hard cap on the number of mobs allowed to exist. PvE will now be capped at 3000 total mobs

After the cap was implemented we saw a massive increase in performance. We went from 9 ticks per second at 50 people to 20 ticks per second. We need to keep watching to see how things look when the server is maxed at 80. If the performance improvements hold we will be able to increase the player cap.

I hope you all are enjoying something different from vanilla; almost everyone seems to like it for what it is and I'm glad we'll have at least this map different from vanilla even if this process is vetoed in the future. I would like to make the best of this opportunity...

Solution?!
If we all go under the most popular areas, we might really kill off mob spawn in a big way. It is a lot of work, I know, but please consider the long term effects of lighting up all the things. This process requires that you do a few different levels of work, finding caves low and high, and maintaining a sense of direction so that one might find their way back. I've found that minimap helps a lot. I think we can make a difference if we try - if everyone spent a few hours into just placing torches underground, we might save ourselves a lot of time in the future from lag reduction and help grinder builders.

Historically, competitive server. We largely want players to resolve these kinds of disputes on their own, within the existing gameplay (though we actively discourage public accusations, instead asking users to /modreq like always).

That said, and otherwise toxic behavior by some players, in-game and elsewhere, has gotten disappointingly out of hand the past few weeks. For example, we’ve had to remove S from nerd.nu/modreq for now because players were repeatedly using it to criticize other users for modreqs either made or directed at them.  C’mon guys, it’s ridiculous that we have to do this to protect players reporting issues.

It’s unfortunate, it’s clear that we need to shift the enforcement line.  So we're going to take the following steps to nip this in the bud right now:

* We are not in the business of protecting players' alt accounts - but if a player has made it clear that they don't want their alt accounts publicized, **is out of line and will be treated as harassment.** I don't care whether the players in question are mods or not.
* Moving forward, excessive trash talk/taunting/trolling (regardless of who started it), and otherwise spammy behavior. Consequences may be issued after the fact. “They were trolling/harassing me worse!” is **never an appropriate justification for your actions**.
* Attempting to manufacture work for staff, or similar behavior, may lead to bans without warning.
* In general - if something you have said has made someone uncomfortable and they have asked you to stop

If you have an issue with another player

Some farms have already been reduced in number, try to keep the total number of mobs below 20. If your farm has currently less than 20 mobs in it, please remain at that number, don't breed up to the limit. A good rule of thumb would be to keep one or two breeding pairs of pigs, sheep, cows and chickens, and then breed as your projects demand, kill the excess mobs to return to the bare minimum.

The current rules were written by many different people over a period of many months. We've edited the text to remove redundant information and to provide a more consistent writing style. It's also about 300 words shorter. 

For the most part

-**Clarification on PVP**: Basically

-**Property disputes with expanding cities/projects**: Detailed clarification of current policy: (1)try to avoid the conflict

-**The End**: Confirmation that we do not plan to reset the end during the course of any particular revision.

This post is so that everyone has a chance to look over and review these changes before they go live. Any questions

-------------------------------

Revised PvE Rules:

**General**

-All MCPublic universal rules still apply.

-No killing or trapping other players in any manner except in clearly marked PVP arenas. Only reasonably sized arena style (think spleef arena) builds are eligible to have PVP enabled. Enabling PVP will be done on case by case basis

-Do not leave large numbers of items on the ground from mining, ect. This is detrimental to the performance and stability of the server.

-The map should be considered open for exploration. Players are not allowed to completely block off large sections of the map. Access to land and buildings should not be ""restricted"". Anything can be explored by anyone. Rare exceptions include structures such as private animal farms.


**Structures**

-Don’t build very close to other players’ structures

-If you have a large project such as a city or megabuild, /mail, or /msg them in chat. If you are unable to come to an agreement, contact a moderator for assistance.

-Scaffolding

-Be respectful of the map and do not mar the experience or view for other players. Certain “very low quality” structures including but not limited to cobble/netherrack boxes


**Nether/End**

-All server rules still apply in the Nether and End.

-The End should be considered stable and will likely not be reset during any particular map revision.

-The Nether should be considered stable and will likely not be reset during any particular map revision.


**Protections**


-Protections exist solely to prevent grief and other unauthorized edits.

-Protections are not used for “claiming land.” Mods will only protect builds (houses, ect) and clearly established large projects such as cities. Requests to protect empty land or to protect a very large buffer around a structure will be denied.

-Protections generally will cover the entire area above a structure (to sky limit) and about 10 blocks below the lowest floor.
-We will not protect to bedrock unless your structure extends down that far. Underground resources are considered to be public property. Mines, will not be protected.


**Banned Items**

-TNT (mods will not place)

-Flint and Steel
-Make a /modreq to request fire

-Water and lava buckets only place static liquid. If you need water or lava made to flow
Mods and Admins reserve the right to deny flowing water or lava.

-Redstone mechanisms, player traps, etc) may result in a ban

-Portals
-Players may not build or light portals. Official portals are provided at spawn and in the wilderness.",,t5_2s52h,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/tmkzi/revised_pve_rules/

1331437507.0,qr3y0,Let's talk about [Survival],SuitableUsername,42,16,90,"Foreword: This is *very* long. 

I've been around in this community for almost two years now.

I'm a pretty old hand, 100-slot-per-server monolith of the minecraft community, hosted on a pretty expensive dedicated server.

I would like to stress that for once I am not trolling

I have primarily been a survival player since the day Creative and Survival were split from the initial

However.

As of late

I've posted my often rude and offensive opinions on as to why this is to multiple people

The true reason for survival being boring is because we scare everybody away.

The survival crowd has ended up whittled down to a small bunch of regular players

Mumble, so that we could make obscene jokes without fear of reprimand. This was to the point that Alansmithee came on our mumble and asked us to come back, because ""mumble was completely deserted without us"". 

Most are killed, to another server. The type of server Survival is, it is very unwelcoming for a newbie. There is flat out no solution to that- We can't implement PvE zones, that just won't work, and you can't change the temperment of the core playerbase.

Rather than more moderation

A breath of fresh air.

I'd like to suggest, or completely remove the rule altogether.

Hear me out, and not necessarily one that I fully support myself.

PvP logging is something that is nearly impossible to detect. You can't tell whether or not somebody did it intentionally or not, frequent crashes, etc etc. 

Should a mod or administrator be (unfortunately for you) watching you PvP log

But this isn't fair to those who are caught

You're wearing full diamond, and you decide to end the java task. Is that PvP logging?

You're wearing full diamond, and thus you are unable to damage them, and you log out- Is that PvP logging?

You're wearing full diamond, and you are unable to hit him, so you log out- Is that PvP logging?

I would assume that the answer most of you would give for the first three examples would be No

But how does one prove any of these things? There isn't really a discernable way (unless the logs show that you closed the java process through a different disconnect reason

I tenatively suggest that the logging policy be dropped completely until such a time as we have ways to prevent these glitches

Here's why I feel no alternative will work:

If we give moderators the ability to ban for PvP logging, of course, cause a huge amount of drama and bring the entire logging policy into question once more. 

Administrators

C45Y's log-trawling plugin that alerts whenever somebody logs during PvP does not remove any of the issues I stated above.

I would very much appreciate discussion on this particular point, when viewed critically, would work.

My second point is in relation to NoCheat.

NoCheat provides an invaluable service to these servers, Nodamage, et cetera.

However, and -aside from the blatant forcefielders, who will plague survival regardless of NoCheat's presence- there was very little difference in the amount of hackers.

However

I experienced a similar thing on the Chaos map, I could reliably hit people, and contrary to the claims that the server ""runs at 20 ticks with or without NoCheat"" and that ""extensive stress testing had been done on the matter"", once NoCheat was re-enabled, PvP went back to being nigh-unplayable. 

I made a point similar to this to Amaranth

There was absolutely no consideration given to the possibility of alternatives- something that is very, could end up killing the survival server.

That is not, I would like to take the opportunity to pose a question: Why should somebody who does not play on the server be making arbitary and gameplay-changing decisions about the server (for another example of this, see the debacle about disenchanting weapons using forges).

It's really those sorts of things that should be put to the community to decide, everybody who plays using craftbukkit!)

Survival without PvP is like.. I don't know

My third

Some will disagree with me. I in part disagree with myself

I feel that we need more of that

My fourth and last point

Clans are both a boon and a curse to any server.

They unite the server against a common enemy at their best- Or they dominate the entire server and ruin it for everybody else at their worst.

I have no adequete suggestion for how to deal with clans- In reality, Team Britain and now the Wolfpack.

The last two revisions have been rather terrible- In part because of NoCheat, Usurp ruled 1.1 and now it seems that the Wolfpack, assuming they do not all get banned, will dominate 1.2)

Rather than discouraging clan behaviour

Why not work clans into events? Clan-based arenas and the like could be really very fun. 

A conclusion.

I don't really appear to be saying anything of use on the topic of clans, Survival is stagnating. It's becoming progressively less and less fun, and I've had almost twenty-five people come to me with the suggestion of us starting our own servers and running them how we see fit. 

I don't think s.nerd.nu is beyond redemption just yet. I'd bloody well like to at least try to haul it out of the slump it seems to be in

I've done my best to verbalize my thoughts in a non-trolly manner, be taken seriously, rather than being shrugged off as ""eh, he's trolling"" once again.

Oh, which is silly.

On C, we're still working out what to do with dispensers - they're still banned for now, but there are a lot of creative ways to use them now with 1.3, so we'll be looking into options for potentially unbanning them.

1347250404.0,zmys1,Reviving Survival,Rcub3161,35,7,45,"This revision and the last have been deprived of pvp

1) The maps now are too spread out

2) Some sort of PvP rating system, k/d ratio, favorite weapon, clan, and anything else you could imagine that has to do with pvp (suggestions appreciated) I know doing these things would be a challenge for our tech team, but I believe they could do it and it should be a priority, somethings could be exploited but players who would exploit it would be punished. (Barneygale inspired)

3) Now, for example I got cow eggs and pig eggs from the last arena. Using this rating system players should be able to obtain these items causing them to want to knock off the top players, to be the top and get these items. If say nyislanders2121 was the top pvper and was the top rated pvper for one week he would get x prize, if we could keep that title for another week he would get a different prize etcetera. I don't know about you but if there was a way I could obtain these items I would without a doubt want to try and get these items, another prize could be a sharpness V sword or protection V armor, though that might be getting a little too extreme. (Barneygale inspired)

4) Bounties using said rating system we could set up a true bounty system where players could offer iron or diamonds for knocking a player off the number one spot or number two spot. It would be a way for players in the number two spot or below to have a chance at getting to number one spot since everyone will want to kill that player for the bounty. This wouldn't require killing him just once

5) Clans, it was suggested that clans be able to open up other clans chests for a limited amount of time, but I feel that would not fly on survival. Also there would be a way from in game to see which clans are accepting members at that time. But, creating a clan would have to be done from the nerd.nu website.  (Barneygale inspired)

6) Buff experience again! Players would not have to sit at their grinders for anywhere near as long in rev 15 because of the XP buff, but at what cost? Players spend more time than ever on grinding because of the new max level. Not only should we buff experience for mining, but buffing experience dropped from players would be great also again, more reward for killing other players.

7) Enderpearls, revs past 17, the end would be free game, chaos. This is great because there will not be any endgrinders since they would get griefed to hell, therefore causing enderpearls to be more rare. Another great suggestion was brought to mind not too long ago in another post, have enderpearls even with full port IV armor take away 2.5 hearts, basically no absorption of four pearls and your dead without regeneration and health potions. Link to the enderpearl suggestion post: http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/zjtst/a_wall_of_text_about_mcpublic_survival_and/

8) Logging, it would stay until not hit for x amount of seconds.

All these things will require a lot of work and time from the tech admins, even though I use me and I, it is a collaboration of many.",Survival,False,,t5_2s52h,survival,http://www.reddit.com/r/mcpublic/comments/zmys1/reviving_survival/

Therefore, fresh start for all players. No inventory, chests, or anything else will be carried over from the current map. 

For this next map we are planning to go back to PVE’s roots. Back in the day, and each map had a unique and memorable feel to its land. Since 1.8 came out we’ve been trying vanilla terrain, but to be honest, it’s got boring. All the maps look like plain variations of the same thing. 

This time around, nothing nearly as crazy as PVE 1, 3, or 4.

Teasers: [1](http://i.imgur.com/5gYZj.jpg)  [2](http://i.imgur.com/4aRO7.jpg)

I know there will be some questions

*“Why reset now

- **In an ideal world we would have waited for 1.2. To be honest, waiting for news on the update. There’s still no set date and the map is too old as it is. I can smell the mothballs from here. We won’t have jungles. However, the new terrain has some interesting features that will more than make up for it. As far as cats go, we’ll have a trade sign at spawn for them.**

*“Can I keep my inv/house/chests?”*

- **No. We all start fresh and clean.**

We already have a rudimentary rail system that centers on the spawn terminal. From this location

-Brom
-CityMaybe

-Pico

-West Portal

Our main rail terminal

[photo of station interior](http://i.imgur.com/ahwLc.jpg)

This massive facility is powered by the most advanced redstone technology known to man and is capable of managing arrivals and departures from 25 separate destinations. The brains of the operation is the collection of four BromTech Mark 9 Completely Automated Rail Transit System (CARTS) computers. 

[photo of CARTS computer](http://i.imgur.com/iRjj7.jpg)

Capable of performing an astonishing 1 operation per second, resulting in the fast, easy, and luxurious travel that the modern consumer so desires. 

[photo of CARTS computer interface](http://i.imgur.com/D3dNu.jpg)

The current plan is to start accepting connections to destinations located to the south and east of Brom. Locations north and west of the city will be added later. We will work on lines as we can

For that reason, with a brief stop in Brom to transfer. 

If you plan on making a rail connection to Brom

For locations east of Brom, -30. There are 5 open destinations in this direction. 

For locations south of Brom, 100. There are 4 open destinations in this direction.

I would like to hear from town and city mayors that would like to connect to the system so we can start to coordinate our efforts. Builders of awesome megaprojects are also welcome to connect to the system.

1375583641.0,1jnrrv,It's like Christmas morning every new revision. You guys rule.,_____Y,29,4,1,"I can tell you that I've been gaming for many years now. I used to raid endlessly in WoW

Every start is filled with the most intense rush for land claims, and just general pandemonium. It's honestly the perfect gaming scenario - dozens, if not over 100 people all sprinting about, trying to get started in this cruel world, with nothing but the skin on their character. Some form clans and support eachother, others become roving traders, and a dastardly few become fearsome raiders once communities are established.

The part about this community that I absolutely love is that you can do *anything* your heart desires. This comes with the guarantee that your hard work won't be destroyed, something you rarely see on Minecraft servers these days. Afraid of pay-to-win? The only benefit of donating is keeping what is, in my opinion, the best server out there afloat. Not sets of Prot X diamond armor with a godsword for donators, just the guarantee that the place that you've made your home will remain there when you get back.

I always like to revisit older revisions before new ones start. I know it may not seem like awhile to you veterans, traded with other clans, and worked my way up simply cannot be matched by other servers. We have history that everyone who has been here can relate to.

That's why I'm making this post. No other server, I went to work to request the two days following off. To sum this gooshy-gushy rant up:

We've talked to the techs and worked out a plan for transitioning to 1.4.1

* All three of our main servers (C/P/S) will remain on their current revision until *at least* when the 1.4.1 patch is released. Once the patch is out, and s.nerd.nu - so **hang on to your 1.3 .jar** so you can connect! At some point each 1.3 server will be taken down, depending on (1) user activity/interest and (2) whether we need the server to set up the new 1.4.1 revision. But hopefully we'll be able to keep them going for a while, and minimize downtime.
* Shortly after 1.4.1 comes out, though stability should improve over time. We'll also be using temp chaos to test our other server plugins, so don't expect a full chaos experience all the time - we may be testing things like LWC, protections, and non-flowing water/lava over the life of the map(s). But this should still be a fun way to explore 1.4.1 with your friends :D

For those of you who are active on PvE, in an effort to reduce the total number of mobs across the server and improve server performance.  We know that many of you are unhappy with the way we handled this decision, including how the decision was reached, communicated, and implemented.  We have been collecting a lot of feedback and discussion over the past few weeks.  With this in mind, the objective of this post is threefold:

1. To apologize for the execution of the mob culling policy;
2. To provide some context on how we arrived where we did
3. To present a set of alternatives for handling mobs on P

----

**First off

On behalf of all the admins, without having to to subject you guys to another mob cap, which I don’t think anyone enjoyed.  We’ve known from the moment we set this up that aspects of this approach would be inherently subjective - there’s no way to establish a farm size that makes sense for every single farm on the server - so we have tried to be as fair as possible in enforcing this.

That said, but letting you guys know to come talk to us if you felt it was being enforced unfairly.  We have tried to act in the best interests of a happy, stable server - but if the players don’t trust the approach and its implementation, then we have failed in our objectives.  Regardless of how we proceed, we want to do a better job of communicating.

Thus, while we discuss alternative approaches, the mob culling policy is not in effect.** This does not mean go absolutely nuts with mobs.  Remember, mob drops are still plumped. But while we figure out a fair way to proceed, we’re not going to be enforcing strict limits.

----

**Second

As you know, PvE had nearly 11,000 mobs in loaded chunks at any one time, and we were running at roughly 2 TPS, or 10% speed.  By comparison, Survival had 3000 mobs and was running at 20 TPS, or 100% speed. After testing and searching out all possible sources of memory usage and lag

*Ticks per second (TPS) is a measure of how fast the server is running.  TPS is exceptionally important, redstone accuracy, boat/cart lag, and many other things.  Having low TPS and high memory use not only lags the game, but puts the server at risk of crashes, like the rollbacks and map corruption we’ve seen in previous revisions.

We knew that past implementations of mob caps were met unfavorably, (as we're now running at a constant 20 tps with roughly 4.5k mobs on average) there have been both positive and negative comments regarding it. We're sorry if any of you felt that your concerns were not heard, but trust me, we pay attention to everything said on the forum and subreddit, and do our best to be active in-game to get a feel for all of the various opinions  brought up in chat. If you ever have any questions or concerns, all of the  server and head admins are approachable, through PM’s in-game, on IRC or in mumble.

There is a great deal of discussion that goes on between the mods and admins, and in them you'll find a good deal of discussion regarding mobs and the PvE philosophy in general. We have tried to leave this threads as unedited as possible, only removing reference to a few specific incidents (in an effort to avoid stirring up further drama) and sensitive information from logs. The gaps in the dates between posts are when enough admins were together in IRC that we could talk there, rather than through forum posts, but these issues have been under constant discussion for over three weeks.

----

**Finally

All of us want what's best for the community, mob drop plumping is still in effect.

Under these extraordinary circumstances, **we've decided to put these various options to a vote.** Voting will be open **after the conclusion of tonight’s creative event**, and we will be using the results to help us make our final decision. In an attempt to reach all of our players and not just the ones active on the subreddit, **this voting will occur in-game, with a /vote command and a broadcasted link to this thread.** Voting will be open for a week, with only one vote per player.   Of course, you’re also welcome to leave feedback below.

----

**Option 1:** Have no practical restrictions on mobs.  Only extreme cases directly affecting server/client performance in the area (e.g. out-of-control villager breeding) would be looked at.

* **Pros:** This allows every player to have as many mobs as they wish.  No subjective enforcement needed.
* **Cons:** Historical data strongly implies that this will significantly affect server performance.  Reduction to 2-4 TPS is likely.  The risk of crashes

----

**Option 2:** Continue with a refined version of the current approach, whenever possible.

* **Pros:** No technical limitations on the existence or breeding of mobs, or the farm is actively being tended to.
* **Cons:** Impossible to develop universal standards that are appropriate for every farm on the server.  Inherently subjective; requires judgment calls from the admins
	
----

**Option 3:** Use an experimental mob cap plugin, but will be public knowledge.  Any reductions in the cap will be announced ahead of time.

* **Pros:** Allows unlimited mob breeding as long as a chunk is active.  Enforcement is objective.  Because enforcement is on a per-chunk basis
* **Cons:** Experimental plugin, especially if the per-chunk limits are gamed by players.

----

**Option 4:** Use a hard mob cap

* **Pros:** No mob breeding lag spikes. Guaranteed target mob numbers and server stability.  Enforcement is objective.

Other suggestions are welcome, as Appleanche suggested in a thread earlier today.  Another is to mess with the extent of mob drop plumping.  And while all of this is happening, we’ll be looking for other ways to improve performance, which may allow us to revisit this later.

I had an interesting idea for a charity event/end of the revision party. This could only happen if PVE and S were reset around the same time. The basic idea is that S would invade PVE The plan goes as follows:

1. Both maps are saved before it is announced downloading later
2. It is announced a few days before the event that S will be **invading** PVE
3. The PVE'ers are given time to construct bunkers, and get ready to battle, S players ready potions and weapons
4. A fancy plugin(multiworld?) or other tech-admin wizardry connects the two maps/servers via a plugin
5. The S people invade the PVE server, and superior number of carebears
6. The chaos begins!

Just an idea

1322673281.0,muwl1,[PVE] Regarding Glowstone &amp; The Nether,Appleanche,26,1,38,"So I'd say less than 5 days in the large majority of glowstone was gone

Glowstone in most small to mid sized servers as well as SSP is a (very) common resource. It's also a very useful and unique one that no other block can duplicate.   Like most players who missed out on the gold rush it's sort of frustrating not to have such a (imo) critical block unavailable.

Now the mods have come up with the idea of swapping Lapis for Glowstone at a 16:1 ratio [here](http://nerd.nu/forum/index.php?p=/discussion/8642/pve-nether-the-end#Item_5).

To me 16:1 is really high.  Lapis in itself is uncommon and you'll get about 4-8 per block.  Veins at least in my playing time are typically fairly small too.  I branch mined at level 13 for about 2 hours last night and explored some caves around level and managed to find just a stack of lapis.  That would only amount to 4 glowstone blocks for 2 hours of searching.  

Compare that to other servers where 2 hours in the nether would probably get me at least a dozen stacks of glowstone dust equaling around 200 blocks of glowstone.

So I guess my first idea would be to cut the ratio in half to 8:1 to reflect this.   Or possibly substitute something that is easier to find but up the ratio.  Redstone might be a good one to do at high ratio

Another question I have is if it's possible to regenerate the Glowstone in the Nether without resetting anything else? That way it's still natural and sort of a challenge to get,False,,t5_2s52h,False,,,t3_muwl1

**Now

Probably the most anticipated command of the revision, that sounds so bad to be glad for). The only issue with our current setup is that this will only work for public chat, and not /me or personal messages. However, if someone persists in messaging you privately after you have requested them to stop, then it's toeing the line of harassment and we can look into moderating such an issue.

The commands for this are straightforward and are case-insensitive

/ignore playername - Will ignore the player with the specified name

/ignorelist - Will list the people you currently have ignored

/unignore playername - Will allow you to return to seeing the player's contributions to chat

And it views like this in-game: http://i.imgur.com/JRG8lGt.png when you type each of these commands.

We will be looking into the potential of getting something set up so that private messages (and /me) are possible to ignore as well

The second big change we're bringing in - **invisibility potions** (as well as **night vision potions**) are once again brewable! The potions were blocked previously over concerns about players abusing the ability of being invisible

&gt;**Edit**: Looks like something's unintentionally blocking the fermented spider eyes from completing its brewing cycle and it won't create invisibility potions from the night vision ones. Apologies for this

* Invisibility potions will wear off upon striking another player
* Invisibility potions will wear off upon being struck *by* another player

So plan your potting wisely

I would like to emphasise great thanks towards **smiler100** for putting together these features that made bringing back invisibility potions possible

To keep some general anticipation going (and to prod myself to hurry up putting it together), and what we would like to carry over, newly implement, or remove as part of Revision 22. 

To declare now, we will simply be opening up discussions about it. I look forward to hearing everyone's input on this topic when we get the post set up, so please stand by and note down any ideas you might like to bring up in discussing the new revision.

New/returning features that will be available **at launch**:

* **Clan chat** will be available for all players - details [here](http://redd.it/1ba4v1) (format will be the same as on C). Remember - *this is a group /msg system

* I’ll be running a **weekly arena league** this revision

* The **survival leaderboard** at http://nerd.nu/survival should be back up and running again (with a clean slate) at the start of the rev!

----

Gameplay that hasn’t changed from last revision:

* The book recipe still doesn’t require leather.

* All enchantments are enabled.  All potions are enabled except invisibility (for now

* Use /unenchant to remove enchantments from items (including books).

* No villagers.

* Experience will be plumped (more on this in the comments).

* Please get a mod to protect your beacon pyramid so people don’t steal the valuable blocks all the time.

* Earn the skulls of the vanquished!  If both you and your opponent are wearing all iron/diamond armor (with Protection 3 or 4 on the chestplate and legs)

We’ll also be adding a bunch of features during the rev

----

Finally, but there are also some where the intention is clearly to prevent other players from playing the game.   And it’s ultimately this latter behavior that we’re not comfortable having on the server.  Yes, it’s a competitive server, but it’s also a server for people to have fun playing Minecraft with PVP.  The line should be drawn where your actions become solely about denying other players that opportunity.

Here’s the general idea of the policy we have in mind

&gt; *Do not repeatedly attack and kill ungeared players

&gt; * *Ungeared means PVP equipment

&gt; * *A good rule of thumb is that if your group has killed a player twice in the last half hour and has no items to show for it

But we’re gonna try not adding this to the rules, no matter how worked up you get over the game.

### General Tips

* Don't grief.    
* Griefing: Deliberate destruction or obstruction of another's creation.    
* Griefer: One who griefs.    
* Play the single-player game before joining the server! There are a lot of nuances of the game you need to be     familiar with before you try to play multiplayer.    
* When you enter the server for the first time
* To talk
* All commands must be typed in chat
* To get back to Spawn at any time
* Need a quick refresher on available commands? Type ""/help 1"" and ""/help 2"".    
* Make an awesome structure
* Have a lot of items you need to get rid of? Don't just drop them. Go to Spawn
* Lava, Bedrock, TNT, Mob Spawners, Flint and Steel, Fire, Minecarts, and     Switches are banned. These items are either not optimized for multiplayer and result in a crash
* Be warned: The server restarts every hour automatically to clear lag and memory leaks.
* Have a complaint
* Want a reserve slot on the server? Donate to Kiva

### Causes of Server Lag

The following are purely hypotheses.

* Large number of droped items on the ground.
* Large amounts of water/lava dynamic spreading.
* Many players online at once.
* Thousands of stored player files.
* Disk usage.


### Future of the Server

There are many things we plan to implement in the near future.

* Player stats
* Automatic cartograph generation and upload

 *  The holes ALL OVER the map. There is absolutely no reason for those

 *  The mountains were ridiculous. Just as the holes they made it to difficult to raid another base. And if someone does raid a base it is almost impossible to push them back. Again I would use a vanilla map.

 *  The map was to huge. Takes 10 minutes by a straight tunnel to get to a base (if you don't fall in a hole) 

 *  Moderating. I found several instances at a certain base where in a protected door, no mods were present. While I know you all have lives and worked for hours to set this up with little sleep. It could have been moderated better.

With my bitching over, drove more people apart. This event has shown many people how to work together and co-operate to 
accomplis a common goal. While it had it's ups and downs

---------------------------------
Alright

So the basic idea is to split the map into sectors and limit mobs in quadrants as well as globally.  The current PvE map is 6000x6000

    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

So what we would do is have a mob cap across the whole map for mobs, that would allow 6.6667 (so we will round that to 7) per sector.  Now, this does not mean you can only have 7 sheep.  What this means is that you will never go below that seven.  If there are sectors (which there will be) that do not have their max count, you will be able to have more in your sector to a maximum (tbd).  This will ensure that you wont lose all of sheep (you will have at least 7).

I know that while this might not be the best solution, this is kind of what we are left with.

What we currently makes sense, if I am not on a major road or near a gate site travel is prohibitive: it's a very long slog. If I want to trade with others from a distant home not on the beaten path I can walk all the way, but to paraphrase someone else, it's Minecraft, not Walkcraft.

Right now there's only one easy way to get to spawn (if you are /sethome far away): stash everything and die. There! You're at spawn

Adding (enabling) the /spawn command would remove this asymmetry, but it's prohibitive once you are settled far afield.

There's an argument that this might lead to more space usage. However

And this isn't PvP
