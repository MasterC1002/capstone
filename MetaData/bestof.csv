As I’m sure you know, and you definitely let us know about it. There has been plenty of community feedback, both positive and negative:

http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/xylrj/just_wanted_to_say_ive_absolutely_loved_this/

http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/xygvd/discussion_for_bestof/

http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/y0rpe/were_on_day_5_of_our_weeklong_no_defaults/ 

The moderation team has discussed this issue up one side and down another. As moderators, it’s bound to make many someones unhappy. We’ve examined the subreddit very closely both before and after the change, and noticed a marked increase in both the quality and diversity of the submissions when the default subreddits were removed from the mix. According to our community poll, the majority of the userbase agrees. The moderators held a vote, and unanimously decided to extend the ban on default subreddits indefinitely. **As of this post, and until further notice, /r/bestof will no longer allow comments from default subreddits to be submitted here.**

Quality and diversity aren’t the only reasons for this change, but at the same time it is instrumental in helping new communities grow and prosper.

* /r/WritingPrompts jumped from 237 users to 2771 thanks to being [featured here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/xvq71/a_redditor_is_given_a_prompt_to_write_a_story_but/c5q2m4v?context=1). That’s a pretty significant spike in traffic

* /r/sex gained over [1

* /r/olympics topped that with over [2

These are just a few examples of what has been happening every single day this week. To document what I like to call “The /r/bestof Effect, it will show how far the subscription count has jumped. He currently provides his excellent service to the meta community /r/SubredditDrama, and I would like to thank him for extending that service to /r/bestof as well.

We are also toying with the idea of holding a “Default Subreddit Megathread” once per week

I know some of you aren’t very happy with us right now, however, promote a few alternative subreddits that address some of the concerns users had about missing out on content:

* /r/defaultgems - a counterpart to /r/bestof. Subscribe to both!

* /r/tldr - a daily recap of reddit brought to you by /u/qgyh2

* /r/dailydot - a community newspaper to catch up on reddit for the day

Thank you.

One side effect is that there has been a sharp increase in meta posts recently ([1](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/xz22y/how_many_people_dislike_the_exclusion_of_the/), [4](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/xygvd/discussion_for_bestof/)), and I *do* apologize for adding to the problem, if you consider that to be a problem. Personally, I always enjoy a good meta discussion, but I digress. Let's get down to business.

I want to conduct a poll to see exactly how the community stands on the issue. Keep in mind that polling on reddit can be extremely unreliable (there are always problems with vote cheating and influence from other subreddits), I want to quote a few comments that members of our community have made both in favor and against the experiment, and let you make up your mind on your own...

---

**In favor:**

&gt;I've been upvoting far more often than I usually do. It's really interesting, it was funny.""

http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/xygvd/discussion_for_bestof/c5qox2e

&gt;Why are we trying to accommodate the people who use bestof as a way to unsubscribe from the default subs and still have their feed full of the small bit of those subs that have something useful? That's not what bestof is for. The inclusion of the default subs naturally leads them to monopolize the visible content in this subreddit, by their own admission, have zero potential to submit content that will be seen, because they intentionally don't subscribe to the subreddits they come here to read. bestof is a subreddit where you share great comments with other people so that people who have missed those comments can see them. It is not a place where you share great comments with other people so that people who have intentionally and specifically gone out of their way to avoid those comments can see them. The entitlement! The parasitism! I see no reason to suffer it.

&gt;It would be great if we could include default subreddits and not have these characters ruin everything else

http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/xygvd/discussion_for_bestof/c5qqo6c

&gt;I love the change. I'm subbed to most of the default subreddits still

&gt;Not only am I seeing rad comments I wouldn't have seen otherwise

&gt;I suggest making a bestof for the defaults. Though

http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/xygvd/discussion_for_bestof/c5qr9j3

---

**Against:**

&gt;As someone who's unsubscribed from several of the default subs

http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/xygvd/discussion_for_bestof/c5qplp2

&gt;I know a lot of people are loving this, the best of reddit. I simply feel that because more people visit the default subs, some of the highest (and lowest) quality comments can be found there. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for other subs being posted on here more often, but I know for a fact that I will be missing out on some great comments if we take away the defaults because I don't check the comments section of every post. And that's probably the same for several other redditors as well.

http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/xygvd/discussion_for_bestof/c5qpg6k

&gt;I will say that I am enjoying the quality of the submissions as of late but that being said I do think we are missing something from not allowing defaults in. The reasoning I have is that we all do not spend the same amount of time on reddit. When I check and askreddit thread in the morning the top comment may be entirely different than if I were to check it in the afternoon. For all I know it may not have even been submitted yet. But once I read the askreddit thread once
My point is that not everyone sees all the default subs

Lots of people expressed their support for my efforts

Then two days after the original post **SoaringDodo** sends me a pm with exactly that intention.

You can imagine the rest of the story... 

**Here's the obligatory: [Look what came in the mail today](http://i.imgur.com/RBqVp.jpg)** Ups

Here is [what came in the mail](http://i.imgur.com/NGa7G.jpg). 

Which I took to [the shelter the same day](http://i.imgur.com/DochS.jpg). 

We have very poor website but you can at least see [this photo taken with the new equipment](http://www.petango.com/Adopt/Cat-Domestic-Shorthair-Mix-14358691). Camera is very fast [even on Auto and with flash](http://i.imgur.com/ZyZop.jpg) and that is very important at the shelter.

But here is what made this story even more special for me: Spending past few months at the shelter and being witness to many horrific stories of neglect and cruelty to animals really took a toll on me.

 My nihilism all flared up and I started closing off to people. And then this total stranger comes along at restores my faith in humanity *(at least for a while)*. 

Not just that he donated his $400 camera in PERFECT condition with accessories


So on behalf of shelter animals of Yakima county

**May the karma rain upon you and all your endeavors**.


**TL;DR** (I post picture of crummy photo equipment from local animal shelter

I came back the next day to find a little red envelope. I got all giddy and checked to find a reply from Krakkagar. He said what's your address

I'd made plans with friends for that night and knew I'd have little time between receiving my meat and catching my train. 8:30 came but still no sign of Krakkagar. 8:45 came and I was getting twitchy because the train station is a decent 20 minute walk and my train was approaching. 8:50 came and there was still no sign of Krakkagar so I had to run.

I had a great night and when I returned
&gt;Dear Sagerian
&gt;I hereby pronounce ಠ_ಠ upon myself for not honouring our agreed apointment. I almost had a pregnant when the big boss man told me 
&gt;it was the night to clean the entire display. 
&gt;
&gt;Yours faithfully
&gt;
&gt;Fuck Bitches
&gt;
&gt;P.S. PM me when you get this and you'll get a tasty reward.

When I hopped on reddit I was red again with a message from Krakkaga saying check your door. I replied saying I was sorry I missed him. He messaged again and I told him I'd be up for quite a while.

An hour or so later the doorbell rings. I hear ""bacon delivery"". I said something to the effect of: ""oh wow

And with that my new bacon delivery friend was gone.

The people in my house were pretty confused.

""He just brought you bacon at 2:30 in the morning?.. For free o_0""

If anything

And cured my pretty horrible hangover this morning.

Thank you so much Krakkagar for my tasty bacon

TL;DR: Redditor promises bacon

I killed with it.  Dad would have loved it.  I hope you all do too.

---------------

 

When you’re a child

As you get older

Then

September 13th was that moment for me. 

My dad was the greatest man I’ve ever met.  I would frequently hear people who knew him tell me “You are just like your father”.  I would only be able to muster out something about how I was far more handsome than him

We would argue all the time about politics.  His crazy ultra-right wing lock up the borders and give guns to invalids talk against my rhythm-nation common man Marxist rants.  We would battle for hours, either we would realize that we were both basically arguing the same point, or my mom would come in and scream at us both to shut up.

But, besides this breathtaking visage, it was our love for making people laugh.  Thanksgiving dinner was a time to get everyone together and doing the other thing we both truly loved…  making fun of my mom.  Whether it was the smoke alarm signaling that whatever was in the oven was ready, or trying to have her remember a joke or read something aloud.  We had a blast with it.  I hope all of you will pick up where my dad and I left off and ask my mom to tell a joke or read anything aloud.  And don't feel too bad.  You can tease her all you want, she won't remember anyways.

I'm not sure exactly when it happened, so it's only fitting that I attempt to make you all laugh uncomfortably.  If any of these really do make you feel uncomfortable, just know that my dad would think they are funny.

So here I am... doing exactly what my father would have been proud of me for:  Milking this bereavement time for all that it’s worth! 

I'm not sure exactly what my dad died from.  Something called a myocardial infarction, he didn't have opinions anymore.  Actually, now that I think of it, this may have just been his way out of getting Social Security. 

We always joked that I'd be changing his diapers when he’s old.  I'd say ""I'll have people for that by then"".  Turns out I won't have to do that indignity for my parents.  That means you too mom.  If anyone knows a good nursing home

*Pats stomach*  I grew this gut just for this occasion.  That's just like normal...  Everyone laughs at that joke but my dad.  Only kidding...  of course my dad went to the gym steadfastly

He was also right in the middle of refinishing the cabinets in the kitchen.  I guess he REALLY didn’t want to have to finish those.  We will add this to the list of unfinished projects.

I probably could have been a really great rockstar.  But my picture perfect upbringing from loving parents ruined all of that.  I couldn't get any rage from anywhere!  What could I possibly be mad at?  Scream about my mom and dad still chasing each other around like schoolkids?  All that gross kissing and hugging?  Or their hilarious little fights where they weren't talking to each other? 

Here's some things that I've always wanted to say in front of my Dad but never could:
Ronald Reagan wasn't that great.  
Sarah Palin is an idiot.
There's probably some rap music that you'd like. 
The warranty plan is almost never worth it.
You won't ever need that receipt.  
You don't need that manual.  
You'll never send in that warranty card.  
The neighborhood kids are not stealing your internet. 

All bourbon tastes the same to me.  I always thought you were faking it when you could taste the difference.

A law banning giving infants loaded guns is not a ""Slippery slope"".

I never really liked watching football

I'd like everyone to remember who my dad was.  He would be the one making you laugh right now if he saw you crying. 

*While crying*  Excuse me

 What is the coolest most spontaneous thing to happen to you while traveling?

from soniaghm
[+1]via  /r/travel/  sent 1 hour ago

In 2005, he slipped and fell, and had to be taken to the hospital by water ambulance (an adventure in itself!). A couple of hours later, my Mom called me from the hospital--they were releasing him, but couldn't give them a ride back (it was a holiday of some sort), so I needed to take his wheelchair to him.

It was raining when I left the hotel with the folding wheelchair. It only weighed about 20 lbs, my legs were bruised and scraped, my hands hurt, and I was on the edge of tears.

Then, it suddenly grew lighter in my hands. I looked around, and a man in a business suit was supporting one end of it. I thanked him... grazie... and he smiled and nodded. On the next bridge, a young couple with backpacks carried the chair for me. On the next, a pair of nuns assisted me... and so on, all the way to the hospital, across almost every bridge.

On the way back, but he was in a lot of pain. My mother assisted him while I dragged the chair (still with help from numerous strangers!), but it was slow going, and my Mom had a hard time taking his weight.

On one particularly steep set of stairs, and helped us across the next few bridges, holding my father tightly, whispering to him in Italian, and stroking his hand gently.
That was the longest, and very worried about both my parents--but it restored every shred of faith in humanity that I might have lost in my 38 years of life up until then. The world is full of love and kindness.

tl;dr Had to drag a wheelchair halfway across Venice... unoccupied... and then back the other way
