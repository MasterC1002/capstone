We are answering questions today. An intern at GIP is helping us type our answers. 

Clarence Harrison:
Clarence was convicted in 1987 for rape, Georgia. Clarence was interrogated about a rape, solely based on rumor. The victim positively identified him in a photo lineup, later proven to be mistaken identification. He was exonerated after GIP found a slide from the original rape kit and performed DNA testing that confirmed that Clarence was not the perpetrator. He was the first man exonerated by GIP and was exonerated in 2004 after serving nearly 18 years in prison. 

Robert Clark: 
Robert was convicted of rape, even though the actual perpetrator was in the courtroom at the same time. (Robert is 5 or 6 inches taller than the real perpetrator). DNA testing proved that Robert could not be the perpetrator; the DNA matched a man already in prison serving time for sodomy and cruelty to children. Robert was 21 years old when he went to prison and spent 24 years wrongfully incarcerated, more than half of his life.

1344977572.0,y81ju,I created Imgur. AMA.,MrGrim,22063,18672,5019,"I came across [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/y65jo/four_years_ago_a_redditor_lets_the_guy_who_made/) yesterday and there seems to be some confusion out there about imgur

*I'll start with some background info:* I created Imgur while I was a junior in college (Ohio University) and [released it to you guys](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/7zlyd/my_gift_to_reddit_i_created_an_image_hosting). It took a while to monetize it, so I had to put some ads on the site to help out. Imgur accounts and pro accounts came in about another [6 months after that](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/ank6i/reddit_ive_been_promising_this_to_you_for_months/). At this point I was still in school, working part-time at minimum wage, and the site was breaking even. It turned out that OU had some pretty awesome resources for startups like Imgur, and I got connected to a guy named Matt who worked at the Innovation Center on campus. He gave me some business help and actually got me a small one-desk office in the building. Graduation came and I was working on Imgur full time, and Matt and I were working really closely together. In a few months he had joined full-time as COO. Everything was going really well, and about another 6 months later we moved Imgur out to San Francisco. Soon after we were here Imgur won [Best Bootstrapped Startup](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/imgur-wins-best-bootstrapped-startup-sees-1-billion-pageviews-per-month/) of 2011 according to TechCrunch. [Then we started hiring](http://imgur.com/blog/2012/02/02/were-hiring/) more people. The first position was Director of Communications (Sarah), then [Jim](http://imgur.com/blog/2012/04/18/welcome-to-imgur-jim/) as a JavaScript Engineer

*Some problems we're having right now:*

* Scaling the site has always been a challenge, which made night life extremely difficult, but this hasn't happened in a long time and I sleep much better now.

* Matt has been really awesome at getting quality advertisers

* For some reason Facebook likes matter to people. With all of our pageviews and unique visitors, but that's the world we live in now. I hate shoving likes down people's throats, so Imgur will remain very non-obtrusive with stuff like this, even if it hurts us a little. However, it would be pretty awesome if you could help: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Imgur/67691197470

* Code that goes on rockets and spacecraft.
* Code that supports the design and manufacturing process of rockets and spacecraft.

We work on everything from large-scale web applications to tiny embedded computing platforms.  We build tech stacks on C#/MVC4/EF/MSSQL via REST to Javascript/Knockout/Handlebars/LESS, LabVIEW… which all together enables us to build, launch, and monitor stuff that goes to space.

**Proof:**

http://imgur.com/bl8dlZ2

Edit: Poor Dan

Edit 2 : We've been getting a lot of questions about how C#/MVC/etc have to do with rockets. They don't. At SpaceX we have 4 separate software teams:

1.  The Flight Software team is about 35 people.  We write all the code for Falcon 9, also on those vehicles; we also write simulation software; test the flight code; write the communications and analysis software, deployed in our ground stations.  We also work in Mission Control to support active missions.

2. The Enterprise Information Systems team builds the internal software systems that makes spacex run. We wear many hats, technicians on the floor clocking in and seeing what today's work will be per those designs...and literally everything in between. There are commercially available products that do this but ours kicks major ass! SpaceX is transforming from a research and engineering company into a manufacturing one - which is critical to our success - and our team is on the forefront of making that happen. We leverage C#/MVC4/EF/SQL; Javascript/Knockout/Handlebars/LESS/etc and a super sexy REST API.

3. The Ground Software team is about 9 people. We primarily code in LabVIEW.  We develop the GUIs used in Mission and Launch control, and pad support equipment.  We are pushing high bandwidth data around a highly distributed system and implementing complex user interfaces with strict requirements to ensure operators can control and evaluate spacecraft in a timely manner.

4. The Avionics Test team works with the avionics hardware designers to write software for testing.  We catch problems with the hardware early; when it's time for integration and testing with flight software it better be a working unit.  The main objective is to write very comprehensive and robust software to be able to automate finding issues with the hardware at high volume.  The software usually runs during mechanical environmental tests.

Edit 3: Yes

Edit 4: Thank you so much everyone! This is ending but most of the group will be back at 2:00pmPST to answer more questions. 

Edit 5: ...and we're back! Engineers from each of our engineering teams are present. Let us catch up a bit and start swering again (probably be about 5 minutes).

**About Us**

We are lawyers

Indefinite detention was passed as part of the fiscal 2012 National Defense Authorization Act and signed into law by President Obama on New Years Eve last Decemb.  It would allow the military to detain civilians -- even Americans -- indefinitely and without charge or trial. 

The provision being fought (Section 1021 of the NDAA) suspends due process and seriously threatens First Amendment rights.  Judge Katherine Forrest ruled entirely in favor of the plaintiffs earlier this month

The Obama DOJ has vigorously opposed these efforts

When you are young and single

Will you starve? Not likely. I worried that I didnt have enough gumption to
get work. That I wouldn't know how to network or something. But at a young
age several people, and
that it was mine to husband if I was willing to work.  Those kind words
sustained me

I mostly just said yes to any opportunity to get on stage. Pay or no pay.
Equity, avant garde, and improv especially. Chicago
has a great improv community
got to know the other members of the community. I called it getting in
trouble. You say yes to something

As for true doubt
newly-married and I was offered a part I would have loved
worked for six years doing anything
I ever was to have family I could support

really get paid.

I said no to the part and immediately (I mean within minutes) went into a
spiral of panic that lasted for months. I was sure I had made the wrong
decision (I hadn't) and would never get a part like it again. But the worst
feeling was that I knew I truly wanted to be an actor and there was no
turning back now. I was too old to do anything else.  This was a feeling I
wouldn't wish on anyone.

I think the phrase ""purely to entertain"" has a nice ring to it. Much better than ""merely to entertain.""

I presently have no plans to change

*Do you sometimes wish you could not be in character for some interviews?
Being in character
the show?*

Well these questions are really related. I'll say that from my end of
the interview
two about
ignorant character. That is frustrating. Of course knowing their subject
lets me make the dumbest possible characterizations of their position or
idea. If you ever see me truly being vigorously dense with a guest
probably know something of his or her subject.  And as I said
character aspect may give some people pause.

*Has anyone ever walked off the set/out of the studio either during or before
an interview? If so

No one has ever walked out in studio. One congressperson was about to in
D.C.
to capture whatever happened. After that moment
representative went on to have a great time with me. I'm not sure what
precipitated the threat to leave.

*How often do you interview people who still don't realize you're ""in
character""? Can you share a story of your favorite encounter with a
""clueless"" participant?*

No one doesn't know I'm in character. I tell everyone first.

*What is your stance on marijuana legalization?*

When we were last in California for the Emmys
shops with lists of things to say to the doctor so he wold give you
a legal prescription. Anxiety. Sleeplessness. What is the difference
between that and legalization? So if it happened
world would come to an end.

Unless... IT WAS THE POT SMOKERS WHO DREAMT UP SUBPRIME MORTGAGE
BUNDLING IN THEIR DAMNED OPIATE FEVERS????!!!!

When I was young
in the eighties it was conflated with crack in the just say no days. I
was truly surprised by the return of drug humor and movies in the last

*Jon Stewart's interview on Rachel Maddow highlighted Jon's philosophy on the
difference between his role and the role of news people like Rachel
Maddow.*

*What
the responsibility or job of a news anchor or 24 hour news host /
personality?  Do you feel you're fulfilling your role? Do you feel they're
fulfilling theirs?*

*Thanks for doing what you do. You're a funny

I think Jon's appearance on Rachel highlighted his ability to be pretty
sharp after vomiting for eight hours.

As for the 24 cable hosts / personalities fulfilling their
roles
If not
to recognize anymore
instead used to emotionally ""engage"" us with their brand personas
means I have a steady stream of material.

I too would be fired if I wasn't fulfilling my role as defined by my
company. Happily they define that as comedy
responsibility beyond working hard on jokes.

*How does your family handle your constantly growing popularity? I know in an

from who you really are. Is that still the case or are they allowed to watch
your show now?*

It has come to my attention that I can't stop them anymore

rough subjects. I don't like the kids seeing that. He drops the F bomb a wee
too much as well.

Thanks so much for all that you redditors did for the rally. I am so
impressed that your idea of coercion is to do good deeds until they are
national news.  CNN and others were reporting your charity blackmail just
days after you started. A new idea
The rally was tremendously supported by you all
Twitter. I have no doubt that your efforts to organize and the joy you
clearly brought to your part of the story contributed greatly to the turnout
and success. Contrary to whatever bullshit quotes you may have heard in the
bullshit press.

See you 'round.

You’ve probably noticed, while Aaron Swartz was aggressively prosecuted for trying to share public documents with the public.  Our government is for sale to the highest bidders.

Right after Watergate, but we could make things work. Today, the system is so badly broken we can’t seem to make any progress.

I became president of [Common Cause](http://www.commoncause.org) in 2007 so we could get Washington working again for regular people like you and me.  Common Cause is a nonpartisan nonprofit org that’s been around for 40 years [fighting for the public interest.](http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&amp;b=4764181)

Here’s some of the work we do at Common Cause:

* [Money in politics](http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&amp;b=4764307) is one of the biggest problems our democracy faces. That’s why we’re trying to overturn the awful Citizens United decision with a [constitutional amendment](http://amend2012.org/about/) that says corporations aren’t people and money isn’t speech. In 2012

* We’re also working to stop the ridiculous abuse of the filibuster we’ve seen in the Senate. [When you need a supermajority to even debate an issue](http://www.commonblog.com/2012/12/03/busting-the-filibuster-on-msnbc/)

* Election 2012 saw an unprecedented [war on voters](http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&amp;b=7719573), people of color, and the elderly. We teamed with civil rights groups, mobilizing volunteers to register as many eligible voters as we could.  On Election Day, [we showed up in person](http://www.commonblog.com/2012/11/07/beating-back-the-bullies-on-election-day/) to ensure ballot bullies didn’t try to intimidate voters.

* Common Cause fights for the free flow of information. We were among many organizations to [stand against SOPA](http://www.commonblog.com/2012/01/18/91-million-legislation/) and we joined transparency advocates worldwide in mourning [Aaron Swartz](http://www.commoncause.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&amp;b=4773613&amp;ct=12188179).  In the months ahead

Here’s some more cool stuff I’d love to talk about:

* I hold five honorary degrees and I’ve been arrested five times for civil disobedience

* I wrote the book [“Middle Church”](http://www.amazon.com/Middle-Church-Reclaiming-Faithful-Religious/dp/0743289501) which calls upon progressive people of faith to take back the moral high ground from religious extremists like the Westboro Baptist Church.

* I hear you Redditors LOVE corny puns

1354116826.0,13xqbr,IAmA a Palestinian refugee from Lebanon and I wish the Arab world gets as little as 10% of the criticism Israel gets for treating Palestinians. AMA.,throwaway874832749,9569,6960,2870,"I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/13t6lx/palestinian_here_i_wish_one_day_the_arab_world/) on r/worldpolitics

Let me start with a couple of countries:

**Lebanon**

Around half of the 400, no access to the Lebanese healthcare system and there are certain restrictions on jobs we are allowed to do. We are issued handwritten [travel documents](www.passport-collector.com/2011/08/10/lebanon-refugee-passport-for-palestine/) of appalling quality (large size, cheap paper). The travel documents don't even have a full date of birth, just the birth year. You probably know about the Sabra and Chatila massacre (from the movie Waltz with Bashir, perhaps my favorite animated movie) were 3000 Palestinian civilians were killed in cold blood. These are at the top of my head, I'm sure there's more. This is what a British MP Gerald Kaufman said in 2011 when he visited the camps:

&gt;When I went to Gaza in 2010 I thought I had seen the worst that could be seen of the appalling predicament of Palestinians living in conditions which no human being should be expected to endure. But what I saw in the camps in Lebanon is far worse and far more hopeless. The conditions are unspeakable, tomorrow and for a future that cannot even be foreseen. At least in Gaza, frightful though the situation is, the people are free within the confines of their blockaded prison. In the camps of Lebanon they are not free.

**UPDATE1: Since many here are blaming the PLO and its involvement in the civil war. That's definitely true to a large extent, this wouldn't  have happened. Look at the Palestinians of Syria, they didn't make any trouble and didn't start any wars, why? Because they were treated like equal citizens. Also, FYI, Lebanon naturalized more than 100,000 Palestinian Christians and Shiites. Second, whether it's Saudi Arabia or Iraq or some other Arab country.**

**What do I want from Lebanon as a Palestinian refugee? Some of you say that naturalizing 450, like property law or proper ID and passports formats that aren't from the 1950's. Also, you say that refugees put a strain on Lebanon. Mind you that a large number of Palestinians work abroad and they all send money to their families in Lebanon so they contribute a lot to the Lebanese economy. Hell, I've been told the Lebanese lira dropped significantly when the PLO left the country in 1982. One more thing, all Lebanese factions and leaders involved in the civil war are now reigning free in the country many of them ministers or MPs, the same people that committed massacres towards their fellow Lebanese. Nobody was punished for the civil war, except for the Palestinians. Why? Because they're not Lebanese

-------

**Syria**

Surprisingly

**Jordan**

It's the only country that naturalized Palestinians after the annexation of the West Bank, but it's minimal compared to other Arab countries.

**Kuwait**

Kuwait [expelled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_expulsion_from_Kuwait) more than 450

**UPDATE2: It seems like a lot of Kuwaitis here are saying that the Palestinians got what they deserved for their support for Saddam. Can you really believe that 400

**Iraq**

Palestinians enjoyed full rights under Saddam's reign

**Egypt**

You can read [this](http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/FMRpdfs/FMR20/FMR2013.pdf) report here. Not only are they discriminated against (no free education) but they receive no UN assistance whatsoever. If they go out of the country for more than 6 months, one observer (a member of UN) noted that ""For all practical purposes it would be true to say that for the last six years in Gaza over 300,000 poverty stricken people have been physically confined to an area the size of a large city park.""

-----------

I'm sure there's more but these are off the top of my head. Also

Moral of the story: Israel naturalized over 1.5 million Palestinians. They enjoy full citizen rights and many of them would remain in Israel even if a Palestinian state is established. Palestinians in the Arab world on the other hand suffer from discernible and vile discrimination. If a non-Palestinian Arab speaks of the maltreatment of Palestinians by Israelis

I am doing this AMA today to help with the Magic Music Bus. The mission of the bus is to teach children and families in remote parts of Cambodia about the importance of basic hygiene

Several years ago, then rediscovered it in their teens.

Various Producers started seeing potential in doing something fresh with the property. Thankfully

In 2009 I started developing a new story. Not a remake, my dream was to do a live-action CGI mix.  Not because John Lasseter, a good friend, had hoped to do it in CGI, but because I was doing CGI long before all of that, as a Computer Graphics Choreographer on the original TRON.  The TRON stuff had turned John and lots of other folks onto the potential of CGI.

Me on TRON: http://imgur.com/JHXsG

Some of my TRON Stuff: http://www.jerryrees.com/page20/page20.html

So I work the sequel story

A snag happens as it turns out people apparently holding the rights didn’t. Bankruptcy

Industry Big Names became my allies

The bankruptcy group suddenly says a “mystery entity” outbid and walked away.

The Industry Big Names say “Don’t worry

What they did is totally legal. Anyone can buy anything and do to it what they will. But I cared about the original film and its characters dearly

I had planned to invite as many of the Original Team as would be willing to jump in again.  Amazing people.

I had planned to invite the twenty-somethings in the industry

And I had planned to use a web portal to allow fans from anywhere in the world to participate – actually trying their hand at animating, etc.

It was a time for all of us to make Toaster together. By the way

Okay

Ask me anything.

HERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING 

* the very cleverly titled DON HERTZFELDT VOLUME 2 DVD is coming out next month and is now available to pre-order. the DVD collects the short film trilogy EVERYTHING WILL BE OK,  with the option for the first time to play the whole story together, as a seamless new feature film. the DVD also includes a bunch of other stuff, including miserable cartoon WISDOM TEETH and over 40 minutes of interviews.  here is a trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e6DHjZ-eRg   

everyone pre-ordering the DVD will also get a free 35mm film strip

* the resulting new feature film shares the same title as the third chapter of the story, with more screenings added before the year is out. it is a somewhat different cut than the one coming to DVD, but sort of not really. come see it on the big screen if you can,  the current list of confirmed cities is posted over at:  http://www.bitterfilms.com   expect one or two surprises

[Website](http://drmichaelham.com)

Today's blackout of the internet has been truly awe inspiring. For the first time in my adult life

I'm a long time Redditor who got tired of watching my freedoms and future evaporate. So I decided to do something about it.  

Throughout my life

Like most Americans I pinned my hopes on first one party then the other to restore some sanity to the way government operated. However, but it isn't the average American. 

I want to show that there are consequences for these actions. The only way to get our Congress to perform it's duty

I am running for the United States Senate to replace a PIPA co-sponsor

Here are [some of my top priorities](http://drmichaelham.com/?p=25) and here is a link to a [Huffington Post article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-ham/sopa-congress_b_1195598.html) I wrote about the danger of SOPA and PIPA to scientific discussion.

I want to be the voice in Congress that stands up for civil liberties and increases opportunities for all Americans.  I am expecting my first child and I want him to grow up in an America that is full of promise once again. 

I don't want to be a Congressman forever. I want to make a positive impact for the people our past several Congresses have left behind: teachers, firefighters along with the entire middle and lower class. I also want to ensure that we continue to invest in our future as we fix the budget. Then I want to return to my normal life and write books and build apocalypse ready cars.

Congress thinks this (SOPA, Patriot Act etc) is just going to blow away, but to paraphrase the great American John Paul Jones ""[we] have not yet begun to fight.""

Almost three years ago, and we'd like to hear from you again!

What we're after is the “paper cuts”

**Ground rules:** (of course

* One idea/papercut per comment
* No trolling in bug reports linked from this thread, no need to post “why hasn't this been fixed yet‽”
* We love all the other browsers on the market (yes, and the web is better off for it. No “browser X sucks, browser Y is the best” comments necessary.
* Make sure you have tried a recent version of Firefox (preferrably with a [reset profile](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/reset-firefox-easily-fix-most-problems)) before commenting. Firefox has come leaps and bounds lately, etc. So make sure you're commenting on the product we're actually shipping, instead of the Firefox you used a year ago. :)
* We will not answer any questions about Rampart.

**TL;DR — some questions that are asked repeatedly:**

* Private browsing without shutting down the current set of tabs is coming in Firefox 20 (get the beta if you want it right now!)
* Flash issues are hard (focus stealing keypresses
* We are currently working on Australis (the visual redesign)

in the chest repeatedly when I was nine then killed 
herself. AMA",10226,1873,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12z8e1/the_govt_interpol_and_the_mob_chased_my_family/,"**UPDATE - Apparently the Slovak news media have decided its a great idea to quote me out of context, slander my name and use my post that I made to try and help people as a vehicle to attack my family. Classic example of the rampant corruption in Slovak government and media. They did not ask for permission to use my pictures. They did not ask for my opinion, and they translated my writing in a very vicious and derogatory manner. It makes me look like I hate my father and step mother, my stepmom was always there to support me emotionally.**

My father was the privatiser of a prominent spa and several hotels
 
My mother was the ""right hand"" to a former prime minister of Slovakia. And no

I was born 1991 in Bratislava, I sought refuge on the internet starting at the age of 9.

If I remember correctly, including my classmates. Nobody was allowed at my house, and I was not allowed to go anywhere. 

I remember my greatest accomplishment of 'freedom'

Around this time, and I was told to keep away from windows anywhere else except our house (because ours were custom built and bulletproof, as was our main car).

A year later we had to leave Slovakia in the middle of the night, so I had no reason to be scared. Apparently Austria had granted my father asylum for the charges he faced. It took a decade of expensive and difficult legal proceedings to finally clear his name and get the government to admit that the charges were fraudulent. 

My mom began acting increasingly irrational. She locked herself out of her car multiple times,000+ opera dress into the donation bin. Some homeless person must be looking quite snazzy by now. Humor: an easy way to cope.

One night in October 2000, and it trickled onto the carpet. I felt serene and stoned off endorphines. Everything was blurry and dreamlike. It didn't seem like any of this was actually happening to me.

(In light of new information

My father heard me scream for my life, she then stabbed herself in the stomach and jumped out of the first floor balcony, breaking several ribs. My last memory of this night was passing out on a gurney while the EMTs talked at me in German. 

Luckily they managed to save my finger. I spent 6 months bedridden in a hospital. I had to relearn how to walk because she had damaged my spine. The knife went all the way through my body

 When reporters asked me how I felt, literally throwing her suitcases on the street. 

My dad later married the nanny

Every school I went to, and took any sickdays that I had as an opportunity to tell my story to the class at great lengths. I had to go to 7 different schools as a result of this. Their rationalization was that I would likely stab someone because it happened to me. At one point a school official asked for a considerable bribe to keep me in school, but my father's assets had been completely frozen, making him unable to pay even if he wanted to. We went from millions to almost nothing.

Note: There's a lot I left out due to space.

Here are photos of my scars

UPDATE - I only realized too late that the details pertaining to my stepmom have been claimed by my aunt in an attempt to smear our family and portray them in a negative light. I remembered that they have first been living together in 2003


""I have made the reddit AMA post to try and make my situation understood, who tried to damage our lives. Because I was still a child when this happened, her words stuck with me too deeply. I realized too late that this was just her way of getting back at us. I wrote the original post after a stressful day, and was confused by the dates.
The claim of my father's 'affair' surfaced only as late as 2003

To put things into perspective

Anita on the other hand

Saying that I was 'interested in UFO' is also skewing the situation

I tried to write my story out as a way of coping

My story was part my own subjective reality growing up

If you are taking as factual evidence the memories of a child under the age of ten

She had killed herself for trying to murder me, who managed to sway my perspective enough to generate this fiasco.

I write this with deep regret

Moja teta 'affairu' vymislela a vtliekla mi to do hlavy, ani Janka u nas nebivala !!!

Nikdo nebere do uvahy ze co spuosobilo vsetko bol politicky terror! Nobody considers that what caused the ENTIRE course of events was political terror.""

People who have questions concerning the political landscape and what really happened


**TLDR - My family who were once part of the government of Slovakia ended up being chased out of the country, and my schizophrenic mom stabbed me multiple times when I was 9. Then she committed suicide in the mental hospital. We were victims of political terror. The stigma got me expelled multiple times.**",,False,self,t5_2qzb6,1352790953.0,,

&gt;what's the one movie that has stumped you (as far as making a decision on whether you enjoyed it or didn't) the very most in your career?

Scorsese's ""The King of Comedy."" I keep waiting to see it again. It keeps going wrong for me. The characters of Rupert Pupkin and Masha are unforgettable. Jerry Lewis is pitch-perfect. NAME is dreamy. I am nagged by a suspicion I'm wrong. I've approved of many leer movies. But in my sort of generic approach (Does this movie succeed in what it sets out to do

&gt;**dippyT**

&gt;How has age affected how you view movies over the years? By that I mean, not marred by technical knowledge such as influence or technique, leads to a more ""pure"" watching experience - one that allows a person to more easily experience the core emotional elements that make a movie enjoyable or meaningful without being distracted by technicalities?

The more movies you see and write about

&gt;**rboymtj**

&gt;How has your bout with cancer affected your viewpoints on things like controversial movies

It was a wake-up call about my mortality. About a man about to be hanged

&gt;**rdewalt**

&gt;What is your ""Guilty Pleasure"" movie?

Russ Meyer's ""Faster

&gt;**Khiva**

&gt;Are there are any of your reviews that are particularly proud of - ones that brought recognition to an unknown film

I am proud that I was the first person to ever write a review of a Martin Scorsese film, I've been excited to champion the work of Ramin Bahrani (""Man Push Cart,"" ""Goodbye, Solo""). My choice for best film of the decade was ""Synecdoche, New York,"" and on my blog I received dozens of messages in fervent agreement. Charlie Kaufman's film is building a reputation as challenging but profound.


&gt;**Paulinboots**

&gt;You are credited as the first major critic to realize what an incredible force in cinema Martin Scorsese was destined to become. What currently developing directors will be the most recognized in 20 years?

Ramin Bahrani.


&gt;**qgyh2**

&gt;Ever watched a movie that was too disturbing / shocking to complete / review (if so what was it)?

I walked out of ""Caligula


&gt;**stephiem**

&gt;What is your process of reviewing? Specifically

I take written notes sometimes. I do not go out of my way to read the book, how good a film is it? New things interested me less than whether ""Twilight Two"" deviated from the novel.


&gt;**lulz**

&gt;Are there any films you particularly disliked when you first reviewed them

Not particularly, we change.



&gt;**tantric\_fart**

&gt;What is your most favorite personal memory of Gene Siskel that at the same time defines the kind of person he was (i.e., act of kindness, something he said, etc.). Details of this memory would be much appreciated. He seemed like a genuine soul and it was fun to watch the two of you worked together.

My appreciation of him only grows over the years. He was formidably intelligent and much of his criticism grew from his skill as a reporter. He liked to say he ""covered the movie beat."" Some may dismiss that; he used it to apply inflicting honesty. I'm glad so many of our old shows survive on the net


&gt;**giantgiant**

&gt;On the first viewing of a movie,"" or ""That character draws attention away from the main plot in a bad way,"") Or do have the ability to let the mechanics go and watch the movie like a ""regular"" movie viewer; to 'get lost in the story'?

The movie informs me how to look at it. In an ideal situation, yet simultaneously observes strategy and technical details.


&gt;**jhaluska**

&gt;Has anybody ever thanked you for a negative review of one of their films?

In an ad

&gt;What do you think of meta-review sites like rottentomatoes and metacritic. Do you think they serve a good purpose

1344935123.0,y70v0,"[BY REQUEST] I AmA polyglot (multilingual person) from Ireland. I only spoke English when I was 21, but now I speak 10 languages and can sign ASL. I've given a TEDx talk to inspire adult language learners. AMA",irishpolyglot,7125,4818,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y70v0/by_request_i_ama_polyglot_multilingual_person/

I am NOT naturally talented in languages. I took German and Irish (Gaeilge) in school

I've had a completely different approach since then and *can now speak ten languages* and sign American Sign Language. To watch **my TEDx talk**, with officially recognized diplomas in several, and the others are various degrees of conversational. So for example, my Spanish is C2 (mastery) and I've worked as an electronic engineer in the language, but my Chinese is B1 (conversational, but still hesitant).

I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about my thoughts on how to go about learning a language efficiently.

For proof that I am who I say I am, twitter etc. and it's always under the handle irishpolyglot.

Here are some typical questions people ask me:


**1. What's your secret? Are you naturally talented

No. I did poorly in languages in school and only spoke English when I was 21. My secret is that I stopped using excuses like ""I'm too old"", and I focused on speaking my target language every single day. A communicative approach, rather than a studious one, will get you much further. I do study, but it's based around my spoken sessions.

**2. I see from your blog that you travel a lot. That's all well and good for you to be in the country

Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact
I always tell people **it depends on your attitude, to fluency in three months, in the wrong continent, to prove how it's what you do, not where you do it, that matters.
You can talk to people on Skype via many sites (one I like is [italki](http://fi3m.com/italki)), but in Columbus, Ohio. There are always opportunities if you open your eyes or try harder! I also like to use Couchsurfing.org and search the city I'm in for the target language, and invite that person out for a coffee. 
You can meet up in person with native speakers of many languages if you are in any large city, you are good to go!


**3. Should I go out and buy Rosetta Stone/Pimsleur etc. What books do you recommend?**

[I reviewed Rosetta Stone for my blog](http://www.fluentin3months.com/rosetta-stone-review/) while learning Dutch. It's the first or second result when you Google ""review of Rosetta Stone"" and one of the few reviews on the Internet that isn't actually a pitch (for RS

Basically, but I feel it's because they've spent so much money that they feel obliged to use RS and other (more useful) resources.

[I've also reviewed Pimsleur](http://www.fluentin3months.com/pimsleur/) and a few other products. The bottom line is that there IS no product that will solve all of your problems. This is basically throwing money at the issue. What you need to do is learn a few words and phrases and use them immediately with a human being. I got so frustrated with this product-focus that I actually wrote a ""sales pitch"" for [the best product in the world

Note that if your focus is just on passing examinations, then a lot of what I say becomes less relevant. **Not me, or anyone else has the ultimate solution to learning a language**, this is all down to what is relevant for you. Many people do the opposite of what I say, and more power to them because they have very different goals. The great thing about the Internet, Youtube etc. is you can get to know other polyglots and see where their focus lies and see if you'd jive more with their advice. ""One size fits all"" products are always a terrible idea.

If you are really curious though, and Lonely Planet phrasebooks when starting off with most languages. I find these teach you to get by pretty well, and are light on grammar. From there you can advance quicker. I would study grammar when I have a base, never intensively at the start.


**4. Does speaking a lot of languages get you laid a lot?**

I get asked this a LOT!! Look, attentive and a nice guy, while also being assertive and a man of the world.

And that's what it all comes down to in the end. After my first four years of travelling, thinking she'd be so impressed with me that we'd be going home within five minutes. It never ever happened. It's as bad as waving a Rolex or pointing to your Porsche. That doesn't impress people ever. Some girls are attracted to guys with money, but if you come across as an insecure asshole then that charm vanishes and the cute and charming bum becomes way more interesting. (For the record, I'm not rich. I earn about the same wage as people I graduated university with, but I am a minimalist and this helps me travel easier. Living in foreign countries also helps you leverage currency differences to your advantage)

So no, and this naturally leads to more opportunities. It's true that if I happen to speak the girl's native language, my chances increase dramatically, but actually you only need to speak ONE language for this, not a dozen.

As it happens, and building deeper connections than having a string of empty one night stands. Being a world traveller influences my love life (for better and worse) more than speaking many languages does.

Speaking more languages *does* make you more of a ""man of the world"", not because I can speak in more of them.


**5. What's the hardest language in the world?**

I've learned Hungarian and Czech to basic conversational level (haven't maintained them though, Italian, Portuguese, German, Esperanto, Irish (Gaeilge), American Sign Language, dabbled in Thai and recently learned Chinese. And you know what the hardest one out of all of these has been?

Spanish.

Yep - not Chinese, it's easy to think that you could theoretically come up with a ""hardest"" language. 

But this ignores the psychological aspect. The hardest language in the world is what is hardest FOR YOU. Any generic list can never take this into account. I had the most inefficient learning approach (for a language I genuinely tried to learn) for Spanish. It took me almost a year to get the stage of OK conversational in Spanish, not the language itself.

If you are passionate about a language, or the ego of someone who is a native speaker or who has learned it and wants you to think they are smart because of that.

Yes of course, then maybe this would be the ""easiest"" language (in passion) for you to learn, or if your family is Czech then you'll dive into that with way more enthusiasm than you ever would for Spanish or French.

Don't compare language. Learn the language you want to learn and learn it well!


**Bonus Q. 6 How do you learn so many languages??**

One language at a time. Focus, while maintaining the previous one. I've seen people try to learn two or three languages from scratch at once, and sometimes it works, but for most of us this is too confusing.

My fluent languages are a part of me now. I lived my life through them and have friends in these languages. I focused entirely on each one for several months or over a year

I don't mix them up so often because I try to use them frequently. This allows me to compartmentalise them in my mind (I do other things like associate body language

Focus is the secret. If you are patient, you will be may more skilled to take on the next. It does get easier - not necessarily because your brain is tuned to language learning, but because your personality is. If you gain the CONFIDENCE to do it once, then you can do it again.

People don't realize how important confidence and ambition are in language learning. It isn't about good memory



*
EDIT 1: Several people are asking **Have you ever overheard people talking about you or dissing you thinking you don't understand?**

I have found indeed come across people talking about me in general, rather than simply foreigner 外國人, since I'm white and they presume most white people are Americans. I found that a little annoying, but hardly offensive. They'd say this loudly enough that I was bound to hear it, but presumed that I couldn't understand them.

And one girl on a metro in Taiwan said to her friend I was cute

Also
Generally, I force myself to voice-over in my head in that language. So even in the early stages, I'd try to *think* ""Oh damn! I'm out of milk! I'll have to go to the store"" or ""That girl's cute!"" etc. in the target language. It's unnatural at first, but soon I get used to it.

Right now I'm in the Gaeltacht in Ireland and think about such things in Irish. It's a conscious decision that keeps me in the flow. If you are curious about what language I **dream** in

Hi Reddit! Nearly 4 years ago I submitted an AMA ([Reddit

As an update since then, and still does, from an effort to extinguish it by various outside influences. It is my hope that more people will learn Navajo so that they can speak to their elders, and to encourage a dialogue about the importance of cultural preservation.

If you'd like to help the effort to preserve the Navajo culture

I also am on a walk that began a week ago at the western border of the Navajo Nation in Arizona and am now in New Mexico. This is to spread awareness of a pivotal moment in our history as Navajo people known as the Long Walk (Hwéeldi). In the 1860s, but their resistance and subsequent return via the Treaty of Bosque Redondo, led to the sovereignty we possess today. The treaty allowed the US government to take Navajo children into boarding schools, where a long line of mistreatment began in the government's pursuit to eradicate the Navajo culture. My walk to is to create a dialogue around this painful moment in our history as we are a few years from the 150th year since the return of our ancestors to our homelands.

I look forward to your questions!

On the 23rd of March one of the largest and bloodiest battles of the war broke out right there in Sadr City. The Mahdi Army rose up to overthrow the occupation. Our rules of engagement were lifted

At that point Iraq was considered ""old news"" and the politicians didn't want to talk about the war. 2008 was an election year so the ratings were more important than the truth. Both sides had something to lose if any word of battle made it home. The most attention it got back here was a 60 Minutes segment about high-tech UAV's - one which completely overlooked the actual fight. Other than that

Instead, and Elliot Spitzer getting caught with a prostitute.

I recently wrote a book about my experience during the battle, help people get a more complete picture of what really happens ""on the ground"" during modern combat, and answer any questions you may have about... well... anything at all.

AMA!",dramaticat,8229, weather board tool shed (5 x 10ms) on 22 acres of land with no electricity or town water supply access in central Victoria.


The old tool shed was a temporary situation whilst my dad extended an old tin garage that was also on the property so we had more room to live in whilst he built us another house. The dream was a mud brick


As life happens nothing went to plan but we had an amazing and unique experience that I'm willing to share if you are interested! To give you an idea of the unique daily/ weekly life activities/ chores/ worries I have made a list:
* Not having electricity we would have to ensure we always had huge supplies of candles lying around. We were very poor so 'just popping into town' almost 20 kms away was not always an option. We learnt the hard way early on


*This was early 00's and Australia was just starting its 10 year drought so rain water that we caught in the tank was for drinking only. Shower water was supplied from one of our dams through a diesel generator. The water was so brown from the clay bottom that if you had a bath you couldn't see your hand 2cm under the surface. Best memory of going to my Nana's house back in Sydney was sitting in a crystal clear water and being able to see the bottom of the bath ( also pee).


*Snakes were a frequent occurrence


*Being the only two black kids ( my brother and I are half white aussie and half Torres Strait Islanders) at a school in a tiny town that lived in the bush with no electricity


*At the time it was a little weird for us to live so differently from the other kids so bringing them back for our birthdays we would be a little shy/ embarrassed
*As cooking was done on an open fire for the first 8 months of living there, the only access we had to town for a few weeks before we could rustle up enough cash for a cheap Camera (bogan spec car).


*The whole thing lasted from about 8 to 15 for me as my mum had been battling schizophrenia since I was 1 week old. The episodes would become more severe and last longer every year. By the time I was 14 my parents had to separate because mum was off chops and dad was hitting the bongs hard for several years by then


Poverty and craziness aside


My story has so much more to it so if you’re interested

Gosh. Proof that I lived in a shed with no electricity is super hard. Hopefully this photo of my family in hillbilly clothing in front of the foundations of our dream house will suffice? 

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/jgKcJlE.jpg?1[/IMG] 

TL;DR Bushlife. Grew up with no power or clean water with a schizophenic mum that thought I was the spawn of Satan and a hippie Dad that loved the green. Time of my life. Many stories along the way

EDIT: Thank you all so much for the interest in my life story! I have tried to get through as many questions as I could tonight but alas it is 6am and I have an 8 am lecture that I should attend. This has been an awesome experience for me to see such a positive reaction from strangers to my story! I promise to continue reading and answering your awesome questions and hey

AMA",countythrowaway,4109,1922,http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16ktvd/iama_former_employee_of_a_jail_where_i_watched/

I was fired after I caught the beating of a triple amputee (you read that right!) on video

Don't believe me? here's a still from the video.

This is one second of over 14 minutes of this poor man being beaten with a mop handle, he is down in the left hand corner, naked and cowerig while being sprayed with pepper spray.http://imgur.com/I8eeq

After I was fired, and I FLAT OUT REFUSED to sign a non-disclosure agreement. One of my biggest regrets in life is not taking that case to trial, but I just emotionally couldn't do it. I also regret not going to the press immediately with what I had as it happened. I want someone to finally listen about what goes on in that jail. Instead of going to the press, I decided to speak with attorneys and help inmates who were beaten and murdered by detention officers in the jail. 

In the last 5 years I have been deposed twice and I have been flown across the planet 3 times to be deposed or to testify in cases against the Sheriff. I have also been consulted by 4 or 5 other attorneys with cases against the Sherfiff. Every single time my name has been brought up (with 1 exception) the case has settled within a few months at the most. The record is 2 weeks. Some of those have gag orders on them or are sealed

Let's talk about the two most recent cases I have been involved in: 

Christopher Beckman was an inmate. He was brought in on a DUI or something like that, or your buddy, or your dad who fucked up and did something stupid while drunk. He had a seizure in the jail because he was epileptic and didn't get his medications. During this seizure he was hog tied, and ran HEAD FIRST into a 2"" thick steel door, concrete walls and elevator doors. His skull was crushed and he died a few days later. I was deposed in his case and very soon afterward the family settled for an ""undisclosed"" amount of money other than the 1mil, and I promise you this..... they didn't get enough. The officers that did that to them? One of them pled out for a year in jail, the other got nothing. http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=14&amp;articleid=20110606_12_0_OLHMIY608751

Dionne McKinney: She is the toughest woman on this planet. She fought for 9 and 1/2 years to take the sheriff to trial and she did it. NO ONE takes the Sheriff to trial in OK county and wins. It hasn't happened in a civil case since the 1970's (from what I understand) She was brutally beaten in the Jail in May of 2003. I testified in this case earlier this month.http://newsok.com/jury-finds-in-favor-of-woman-who-says-oklahoma-county-jail-detention-officers-assaulted-her-nearly-10-years-ago/article/3738355

Why do I live so far away? I fear for my life. I left oklahoma in march of 2010 after I turned over every piece of evidence that I had to the feds. When I have been flown in, I had to be there for almost a week. I spent 4 days barricaded in my best friends' house. When I left my family in OK after testifying a few weeks ago, I knew that I'd never be able to see them in Oklahoma again and flights to me are not cheap. 
Here is an absolutely scathing report from the department of justice about the Oklahoma County Jail in 2008.

TL:DR I worked in a jail where I saw human beings being treated like dogs every day

*EDIT*: I had no idea this would get any attention

*EDIT 2*: I feel that I should address this here: this is a PRE-TRIAL facility. These are not hardened criminals who have already been charged and convicted. These are people who are JUST coming into jail

We are too. We'd like to share with you everything we know and answer any questions about how we work with celebrities etc for AMAs. In regards to the Morgan Freeman AMA and celeb AMAs in general:  

* This was set up by the publicity team from the film studio for Oblivion. I interacted with them over the past few weeks to set this up. This is not uncommon for celebrity AMAs. Though it is not uncommon for an assistant or someone else to read the questions and type answers for a celebrity

* We were told Morgan Freeman would be answering the questions for the AMA himself (with someone in the room typing what he said) and we believe this to be the case. If we find out otherwise we will let the community know and this would be a HUGE violation of our trust as well as yours. It's hard to imagine that a pr professional would go to such lengths to pretend to be their client in a public forum

* Most but not all of the bigger celebrity AMAs start with a publicist or assistant contacting us to get instructions, the link to the step-by-step guide in the wiki, and sometimes examples of good AMAs by other celebrities. We also often walk through the process on the phone with the publicist/assistant, or sometimes even the celebrity themselves.  

* We do not get paid by anyone for AMAs.  

* We very often get approached by celebrities who only want to spend 20 or 30 min on an AMA or do nothing but talk about their project. We try to educate them on why an hour is the absolute minimum time commitment

* On occasion we have ""verified"" to the mods that a user is who they claim to be. We usually do this just to let the mods know in advance what the username will be so they can prevent fakes. This is not usually an issue since we advise everyone to tweet or post a picture as proof. We won't do this anymore in the future and there should be public proof at the start of an AMA.  

* The mods here do an amazing job
  
We will try to answer all the questions we can

**Update**: *I have spoken to Mr. Freeman's/Oblivion's PR team and they have stated in no uncertain terms that all of the answers in the AMA were his words,False,self,t5_2qzb6,1365800281.0,other,mozilla,t3_1c823w
1376434479.0,1kb7e4,"IamA Guy who quit his job, sold his car, moved out and bought a one-way ticket to Africa. I spent the next year and a half traveling across the entire continent, mostly overland and solo. AMA!",ninefivezero,5899, thanks so much for the questions, goodnight!

Hi everyone!

First

On December 28th of 2011, not knowing what I was doing or when I'd return home.  I ended up spent the next year and a half traveling the entire length of the continent, all the way to Alexandria, Egypt and finally returning home to Seattle on July 3rd, of 2013.  

Here is a very rough outline of the journey: I started in South Africa, staying at backpackers and doing a bit of scuba diving before that trip fell apart due to not getting along. I flew back to Cape Town alone, went to AfrikaBurn, spent a month+ on a farm, then on the coast. From there I crossed into Botswana, where I spent a month with a British guy I met through Couchsurfing, then rode a single speed bike 1, and we spent the next two months together, then rode buses and Couchsurfed my way through Burundi, and spent an interesting but somewhat difficult month in Ethiopia. I was also unable to get a visa into Sudan and had to fly over it

**Some highlights:** Simply saying 'yes' to the journey in the first place, going to AfrikaBurn, cycling across Botswana, paddling Lake Tanganyika, hiking in the Simian Mountains of Ethiopia and finally reaching Egypt, accomplishing my goal of crossing Africa and most importantly the people I met on the way.

**Some lowlights:** The initial 4x4 across Africa trip failing, and saying goodbye to a place I love.

**Death:**  I've been in villages when there have been children killed by lions and crocs, heard stories of cerebral malaria killing in only three days, a shooting rampage in Ethiopia and saw the aftermath of a minibus crash that killed all 13 on board.  Life is cheap.  

**I never thought I would:** Travel up Africa in the first place, eat elephant meat, do the dressing on a fresh male circumcision, cycle the Trans-Kalahari, and be an honored guest of local headmen.

**Internationalism:**  I would find myself at parties with as many as 10 different nationalities.  Mostly through Couchsurfing, America, France, Spain, Russia, Sudan, India, Egypt, Slovakia

**Transportation:** I used just about every method possible.  Driving in a 4x4, riding trains, bicycles, canoes, motor boats, donkey carts, airplanes, motorcycles

**Accomidations:**  Everything from mud and grass huts to 4-star condos.  I found myself sleeping in logging camps, laying in the sand of the Kalahari, the homes of cattle ranchers and the homes of many, many Peace Corps volunteers.  

**Overall:**  Africa is amazingly safe, and those growing pains will have major consequences and last well into the future.

I lived in KWC when I was 2-3 years old but I have no recollection of that time. Later on, so my bro and me were dropped off at my relative's place in KWC everyday. I got to know the place pretty well because I spent at least 4 hrs there everyday from 1984 to 1991. So ask away!

Note: I will be back in a few hours to start answering questions
 
Edits:

(1) I know a lot of you want proof. I can think of two things that may prove it

(2) Many of you asked for pictures inside. Even though everyone has a camera now

(3) Bishop Ford's memorial School is on top of a hill next to KWC and it's next to a cementery. Even most Hong Kong people don't know this fact unless you are a Kowloon or Lok Fu local!!! People from Lok Fu can back me up on this. I guess this is like a semi-proof that at least I am local to that area.

(4) I need to go now but will be back and answer a few more and hopefully find my photos and send to the mod as proof. Thanks for the interest in this AMA!

Edit 2:

(1) I just sent some strong circumstantial proof to the mod because as I said I don't have direct proof. 

(2) My answers are vague? Yea true

(3) I am not familiar with every single place in KWC?  This is true, cousins and me went out and played, we played OUTSIDE the fortress. Kids don't play hide and seek inside KWC. 

Edit 3:

(1) The mod hasn't got back to me about the proof I sent

(2) Lack of photos inside? I am repeating myself here, I could't just take random snap shots of the place. Do you notice that all the photos of KWC are from journalists or professional photographers and not from residents who took photos of themselves inside? It never came to mind back then that I should take a photo of myself in the dark alley under the leaking pipes with all the shits and trash on the ground.

(3) I will probably pop back in tomorrow to answer a few more questions.

Edit 4:

(1) [Here is the google map of Bishop Memorial School](http://maps.google.ca/maps?hl=en&amp;q=Bishop+Ford+Memorial+School,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;bpcl=38897761&amp;biw=1191&amp;bih=624&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wl), you can see the Kowloon Walled city park just next to it.

(2) I will probably look at this thread again for the last time tonite and answer a few more questions and maybe do a summary.

I didn't think this was considered unusual or negative, but mentioning it elsewhere on Reddit has shown me there is a lot of misinformation and hostility toward it.  So, I invite you to AMA.",MechanicalPencils,7538,4120, kindergarten). This is our third year. 

I homeschool because I want my kids to have an experience-based education. We use textbooks for things like math, writers, and artists. I teach writing using my own curriculum to my own children as well various groups of kids for pay (which is how I fund our travel). I send them out for music, art, and PE classes, as well as science lab classes. But the basis of their education is in experience, and we spend a lot of time outside, speaking with experts, as well as across the country and overseas. I'll link to two of my Facebook albums, including a week on the road studying geology

EDIT:  Removed albums because of morons.  

I think that's enough fodder to open with. If you have any questions, and I would love to dispel some of them. 

EDIT: I forgot to mention that we do not homeschool for religious reasons. I am an atheist, and my kids are free to decide for themselves.

EDIT again: This is exploding

Socialization:
My kids do something with other children every single day. The have art class, books clubs, literature circles, various co-ops, and one-off special event type things regularly. Parents organize gatherings of kids similar in age on a regular basis. We belong to a community of homeschoolers that is made up of over 150 families in our area. Three hundred children in these families participate in various activities offered by the group. All kinds of kids, all different ages, with all sorts of personalities and abilities/disabilities. There are some they love, and they deal with it all effectively.

Sheltering:
Both of my children are away from me quite often. I do not shelter or smother them. They learn from other people, but I have no illusions about what's coming up in the next few years. 

Money:
The way we homeschool is kind of expensive, so to those of you who stated you are considering homeschooling, please don't factor that into your decision. 

Religious vs. non-religious homeschoolers:
We are secular, and did exist in much greater numbers in the past. The demographics of homeschooling are changing drastically, and I think it's important for us all to note. I believe that keeping your child at home to seclude them and indoctrinate them into anything is flat-out abuse. I hate that what I do is mixed up with this other kind of homeschooling, and that's why I decided to do this AMA...to give another viewpoint. 

I'll be answering more questions later

I am currently sitting here with my mom who is willing to answer any questions related to her life in Cambodia

She was around 11 when they chased everyone from the city and made them march on foot to labour camps. There is so much of her experience I haven't heard yet

[This is her and my dad when they first met at a refugee camp in Thailand.](http://i.imgur.com/q5MHC.jpg)

-------------------------

One of the reasons why I decided to start this AMA is to raise funds for a personal cause.

My mom lost her parents during the time they made everyone work on the farm in villages. When the regime fell, but also in memory of his brother (my grandfather) who had always supported him to make sure he had a good life while they were growing up.

She left Cambodia in 1983 and never had the chance to return. My parents and I grew up in a low income household before I started workig.

We recently got news this month that he was diagnosed with lung cancer and is already at the terminal phase

What I'm trying to do is basically raise enough money so my mom can go to Cambodia (she doesn't know this yet!) to meet her uncle

TL;DR: My mom's uncle raised her when she lost her parents. She hasn't seen him in over 28 years and now he has 3 months to live. So I'm trying to raise money by doing this AMA. She's not aware of it

1366554813.0,1cstrm,I did research on facial attractiveness for years at a major university and published in the field. AMA,norcross1,10116,8021,3978,"Update 7 PM GMT on April 23:  Thanks for all of the interest &amp; the questions (and the Gold). The conversation really went in a lot of directions &amp; it was interesting to see it unfold.

I did most of this AMA in 20 hrs straight (like a lunatic) - so my wording was not always the best &amp; there might be some unclear statements.  I've tried to make some edits to clear things up more.  In general, though we can usually spot trends. Even since the AMA, I've argued about some of the questions with people I know who have done similar research.  Plastic surgeons have huge disagreements over techniques and what is aesthetically pleasing too.  So, all of this has to be taken in that context.  There are no absolutes in this area because of subjectivity - though we can understand a great deal about the topic based on things that are repeatable in research studies (and thus, more likely to be objective).

TL;dr:  Facial attractiveness has a lot of components like symmetry, facial ratios, ""averageness"" (how much your features represent the average in the population - like the average length nose), and a viewer's personal preference (which can make up a large % of the equation).  So, it's complicated &amp; sometimes contradictory, as research often can be.  There are still a lot more questions than answers in the field.  At least we know some of the major components - and this info is based on empirical research in psychology, literature from plastic surgeons

You will be able to follow my updates and get draft chapters of my future book at : http://rebootedgirl.wordpress.com

I also created http://www.reddit.com/r/rebootedgirl

**Introduction**

My new boyfriend has been insisting for months that I do a IAMA but I always refused because I feel that this is simply too personal. He told me that it was important I share because it could be an inspiration to others and in the end

If you want to read it

**My childhood**

I was an accident. Both my parent made that pretty clear in my mind, I arrived.

I grew up miserable. My father was an alcoholic. He worked as a carpenter and worked long hours outside of the house. As soon as he came home

My mother on the other hand is I guess a co-alcoholic and somehow thinks that our life was normal, neither have any real education.

Both pretty much ignored me all my life. If my mother was hungry, I learned to fix myself a sandwich quite early. Only supper was guaranteed to be on the table because my father ate with us.

I couldn’t receive any friends

So I grew up limited only to meeting kids in school which sucks because real friends see each other outside of school.

I sucked in pretty much every subject. Not getting any help on homework and my inability to sleep until late at night because of my parent’s arguing didn't help. 

But the worse was that nothing rang a bell in my mind. It was all normal. It was life. Movies and TV showed fiction including when it involved happy families.

I began lying to friends about my family but I couldn’t realize that they were actually telling the truth. I couldn’t conceive of parents who actually loved their kids. That was on TV

**Teenager years**

Around 11 or 12, because it couldn’t understand you.

At 12 however

I was desperate for attention and certain boys quickly discovered it. I lost my virginity at 13 to a guy who was a year or two older. 

**Drugs**

Soon

Drugs helped me avoid my problems and allowed me to fly through the days either without feeling anything at all or by letting me feel things that had nothing to do with my daily life.

But more importantly

Most of the time however, I think I mostly wanted to know if people would miss me when I was gone. I don’t really want to talk about that, not even with my boyfriend in private.

**Death of my father**

When I turned 16

He refused all treatments and chose to simply die at our home

For a little while, but in an excessive manner. She stopped making meals altogether but continued buying the same groceries as when we were three in the house, letting a lot of the food spoil.

**BDSM**

That’s roughly when I started dating a guy who was into BDSM. Sorry it took so long to get there.

He was one of the guys who used to give me drugs but he liked to have it a little rougher. We started visiting a local BDSM dungeon where he would tie me up and whip me or spank me.

In the beginning, I was stoned most of the time and barely felt anything.

I wouldn’t say I was his girlfriend or anything serious like that. He was just a guy I frequently saw.

**Alone in the dungeon**

But one day

I should have followed him, if only to feel welcomed somewhere.

I had dropped out of high school by then and didn’t know anything about anything. I couldn’t do the laundry, a complete wreck.

Of course

**Enter Frank**

But I met Frank (fake name). Frank was one of the masters visiting the dungeon. He was single but he wanted a full time slave girl to live with him. He gave classes on bondage and safety in BDSM and helped a lot of people

I think he had noticed me the first time I went to the dungeon with my ex
All I know was that he paid a lot of attention to me when I was there alone. He did a lot of bondage demonstrations using me as a model and even practiced his suspensions on me which I kind of liked.

I had stopped seeing my ex since he had gotten banned and I was now cut off from my supply of both drugs and sex to get my mind off of my solitude.

**Accepting the proposition**

So I began to open to him and one day

I didn’t know what I was getting into

I left with him to reach his loft. It’s in an old industrial building. It’s a unit in the middle

The rest of the loft was occupied mostly by home-made bondage equipment

He told me that he wanted a house slave. That I could leave anytime I wanted by saying my safe-word but that until then
I guess today that my motivation was mostly to live somewhere with someone who would care for me and Frank was the closest I could find. We talked a lot and the next day we went to my house so I could pick up my things and say goodbye to my mother who was obviously unconcerned that I was moving away.

It’s only when we came back to his loft that I began my 16 month journey…

**My beginning as a slave**

Frank carefully helped me pack my few things in boxes for storage and in all seriousness

At first, 16 months later.

Well, I was fully naked around the clock, for more than a year.

Frank works in a factory on shifts. He sometimes works the night shift

One of the first things he did was get rid of all calendars and clocks in the house, using only his cellphone for communications.

At first

Quickly, as he said it.

**Getting used to it**

Gradually, including cooking, cleaning the loft or servicing him sexually. When he wasn’t there, I was left instructions on what to do, like meditation or even just stretching exercises.
Rapidly
I realized that sometimes, I stopped asking or caring about which day we were.

Today, I didn’t see any alternatives. I was warm, I was secure, I was loved and unlike her, the few times I was hit I actually welcomed and enjoyed it as it was usually followed by some of the best sex I ever had.

Several times, but I was usually expected to play a certain role, like remain silent for the evening and simply serve food for everything or even just remain on all four and serve as a human footrest for the whole evening.

Only twice did someone else had sex with me

**Long term roles**

You see

But the worst part for me to endure were the 3 weeks or so I spent blindfolded. Not once in those 3 weeks was I allowed to see anything

At first, Frank received friends over and I had sex with someone but I am not sure if it wasn’t Frank himself. It sure felt familiar.
The other time was for a threesome.

Eventually

**Getting out**

One day
anymore.

He confirmed that was what I wanted and brought me some of my clothes to put on my pale carcass. Without any sunlight in 16 months
He didn’t drop me on the street like I was afraid he would do or like my mom told me men acted when you said no to them. He asked me the date I thought we were and I was off by a good 3 months

I had left the dungeon that night on a hot summer day and when I came out
We found my mother but I discovered she didn’t even care where I had been or that we hadn’t spoken for that long. The three of us ate supper without even speaking a word.

I stayed with Frank for another 5 months but I wasn’t his slave anymore. We did continue to have sex and even do a little BDSM play but we were back to the talking phase we had in the beginning. We spoke a lot about what I had gone through and I shared all my thoughts and emotions. He apologized for the last part where he asked me to stay silent for so long.

He mostly wanted to be sure he didn’t somehow break me or traumatize me.

He tried to convince me to try it again

**Finding a job and moving out**

Two months after I said my safe-word

Three months later
We stayed in touch for a while

**Now**

I eventually made a new boyfriend
Somehow

**Conclusion**

What scares me today from time to time is that if he hadn’t begun to impose long term rules like the no speaking part

But I grew out of that and slowly defined who I was and what I wanted and didn’t want and even learned today to say no to my boyfriend

**Summary**

If you didn't want to read

- I was an accident and my parents ignored me all my life
- desperate for attention
- I eventually dated a guy who was into BDSM and when he was kicked out of the dungeon
- Frank asked me to be a full time slave at this loft and I eventually said yes
- I spent 16 months naked at his loft as a slave
- One day

**UPDATE Friday Morning**


I am trying to answer the questions I didn't get. I didn't fight with my boyfriend (but he did get a BJ). Here are some of the most asked questions:

- The safeword was ""MacGyver""
- No
- I was with Frank from August 2002 to January 2004
- Since then
- I didn't take any drugs since the night my ex was banned
- I was 18 when I said yes to Frank. Not 16 like some understood.
- the problem with Dental care is because my current boyfriend is obsessed with his teeth

Hi my name is Devin and I'm 21 years old. I can't even begin to wrap my mind around what has happened. Who thinks they're gonna wake up one morning then have their house destroyed by a jet?? My brother was the one who saved the pilot (Colby Smith)
The amount of support I have gotten has been incredible.
I decided to turn to reddit since I knew it was such a new and weird story.
It's even crazier that no one died.
But I guess I wanted to see how many people have had anything similar....tornado

UPDATE: We have lawyered up

and just cause i can: here's a video! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE_Qo9FPxME&amp;feature=youtu.be 

my brother's story: My brothers story is actually really cool and it gave me chills when he told me. He was playing guitar hero in his room then got up to go put his contacts in. He was standing in the bathroom when the jet hit. He said it was a loud thunder noise and huge explosion and the house started shaking and the power cut off. He popped his head out of the doorway and saw his room on fire. He ran down the stairs and out the house without shoes on. Ran to my neighbor's house and then found the pilot right beside that house. That's when the pilot said he was sorry for hitting our home and my brother told him it was alright and they needed to move him to safety. There had to be a reason he got up at that precise moment to put his contacts in

I never went back to that profession and am now doing something completely different. 

However

If proof is needed I can scan my CIS card which has my name and face but I will only do this to the mods as I don't really want to be incriminated for bean spilling by my former employers who were

**EDIT 1:** proof sent to mods.

**EDIT 2:** Just so nobody else need ask: a council house is British cheap housing owned and managed by a local authority (regional government) rented out to tennants who can't afford (or don't want) to rent or buy privately owned property. Council estates refers to large numbers of low rise council owned buildings in one area

**EDIT 3:** I should probably point out that council flats/houses does not necessarily equal run down slums, but there are an equal number of well maintained council properties and the vast majority of council tennants are regular, nice, law abiding citizens. The nature of my job (i.e. repairing void tennancies where damage has been caused or the tennant lived in such a horrible way that he left the property in a vile mess) means I wound up seeing the worst end of the spectrum, not the best. So the stories I have to tell reflect this. Just don't make the mistake of thinking they represent what is the absolute norm.

**EDIT 4:** I'm getting a lot of accusations of being American. I'm not sure why. Some people are saying I use American spelling. All I can guess is I'm using Chrome, frankly, in the minority.

YES! The answer is yes. If you have access to someone you think the community might want to have an AMA from, **you don't need to ask for community approval**. It's not necessary, because the answer is yes!

So to outline the response here, I want to offer my reasoning here.

* Yes, ""would you be interested in"" posts just don't belong here. It's not an AMA and it's not an AMA request. Ultimately, I'd like to see an IAMA free of AMA requests as well, and the mods here have been working on a solution, but for the purposes of this thread, **""are you interested?"" posts don't fit in here.** It'd be like having a DAE post get on the front page of IAMA.

Multiple Choice
-------------------
Consider open book tests using page references 

Limit to one word or short phrases

Provide only one choice per letter (eliminate: A and B &amp; All of the Above)

Eliminate: None of the Above

Offer a maximum of 3 choices

Avoid using negatives in questions (Which of these is not...)



True-False
-------------
Avoid negative or comparative wording (which is NOT

Avoid the use of specific determiners (always

Balance the number of true answers to the number of false (Ex: tell the students ""there are 5 true and 5 false"")

If this is impractical

Eliminate the need to rephrase false statements to make them true


Fill-in &amp; Completion
------------------------
one word answers or short phrases only

Provide a word bank and/or page number clues

Give the first letter of the answer

Limit the number of fill-in-the-blank responses to 1 per question (Ex: President [blank] was the 1st President of America


Essays
---------
Weigh the merit of using any essay questions at all

If you must use essay questions:

Allow students to list answers without complete sentences

Provide ""answer starters"" (provide the first sentence or paragraph from a well-written essay)

Consider providing open book or notebook time


There were several other references to ""consider giving open book tests with page references"" that I eliminated as redundant. Geez

For the first time in a long while I do actually feel something going on in my lower stomach. My doctor warned

I will keep you updated, I promise to take pictures. That is if you want me to. My doctor guesses this will weigh close to 6 pounds! So buckle up and pray for my butthole.

This is the first time this has happened to me. I've gone 7 days before, I'm going to go to the damn bathroom!

Edit: guys my girlfriend has been reading your comments and thinks we need to go to another doctor

Edit: Here's attempt number 1 for trying to get it out after the enema. Warning that this is graphic: http://i.imgur.com/D6S6l.jpg

Edit: Final update for a while guys. I'm posting this from the hospital. There are doctors and nurses wearing what looks like very expendable clothing. The doctor tells me there will be a manual retrieval that should have happened days ago. I know that you guys aren't the praying type but I need some sort of God on my side right now. I'd say that I'm scared shitless and I think that's a pretty accurate statement. Updates as soon as humanly possible. Reddit

**12:01 CST Update - Sorry I fell off the face of the earth earlier. I went in to the hospital and had a rather unpleasant experience.  They gave me a drug called 'golytely' and some other mild sedatives that basically allowed my ass to loosen up enough to where a nurse(male) could get his claw mouse grip into my asshole(Manual Disimpaction) and rip out what felt like a sword. In reality, I asked if that was all that was coming. He laughed and said I was in for a grand finale after my next enema. I am too exhausted to even thinking about taking on that chore tonight. Me and my asshole are currently not on speaking terms. It's sore and feels violated. No lacerations, but very, very sore. Tomorrow is the day Reddit, tomorrow is the day. For your support all day and advice to go to the damn hospital, you shall be rewarded with countless pictures.**

This is my first time trying to post on a website like this


I'm an 83-year-old author with over 30 years of writing experience


My novel is a family saga called ""The Falcon and the Dove"" and it's currently only available as a digital download through Amazon ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Falcon-Dove-ebook/dp/B0097OZA1Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362247141&amp;sr=8-1 ) 


As part of a writing course thirty years ago I had to write several short stories. One in particular made me think I could expand it so that is what I eventually did. By this time I had already been writing for several years, one about my time in Taiwan. None of these I had published but I was able to draw on these experiences when writing The Falcon and the Dove. This took five years to complete in between working as a gardener, travelling to Taiwan to work as a volunteer teacher, visiting family and friends in England and abroad.


I was born in Taiwan/Formosa, near Southampton. My mother taught me at home, as she had my brothers and sister while in Formosa, until 1939 when I started school at the age of ten, then in the war I was evacuated to Malvern. At the end of the war I had hoped to train to be a vet but as that was not possible I trained instead to join the Land Army. I worked, mainly in dairying, until the Land Army disbanded in 1951 when I married my husband who was a farm worker. We had five children and I now have the joy of not only the addition of their partners but fifteen grand children and six great grand children. I still enjoy gardening, church activities, travelling.


Please feel free to ask me about my life

**In an attempt to answer the common question: How did I get started?**

 I took my first photo aged 10 with a very simple box camera. Oddly
 My passion for photography grew over the years at school where I taught myself to process and print my black and white photographic efforts.

 I left school at 18 with the idea of going to University in London to study 'Film and Photographic Science' (yawn, feature films and IMAX (as a tea boy mostly). Sweeping, tidying up, holding lights, cleaning lenses etc. etc. I learnt by watching the masters of their crafts.

 The pay was appalling and so I had all sorts of evening jobs like selling loft insulation

 Finally after 4 years I knew it all and needed to move on to greater things and more pay so applied for jobs with the BBC. I got several interviews and finally got a job as assistant cameraman at BBC Bristol. I worked there for another 4 years alongside some of the greats including Alan Heyward, Hugh Maynard etc. (IMDB or Google them). At the BBC I realised I didn't know diddly-squat about the job and so stepped onto an even steeper learning curve that I have never got off.

 After another 4 years the pay was again not enough to support me, Partridge Films and the BBC NHU as a freelancer!! They were all offering interest free loans so that I could buy a camera kit and then work to pay off the loan. I was gobsmacked and took the BBC offer as it was where I was based and new the producers etc. The BBC leant me £18,000 ($30,000) and I bought a second hand ARRI HSR 16mm film camera and lens. On the strength of a 2 year contract in my hand the bank lent me a further amount (which I am still paying off until 2022! as part of my mortgage even though the camera was superseded 10 years ago).
 
 I remember my first big job as a freelancer was filming Terns (birds) on the Farne Islands off the north east coast of UK. The producer Neil Lucas accompanied me up there and helped me into the tiniest of fishing trawlers (think miniature Deadliest Catch) with my newly purchased camera kit. I didn't have insurance and pictured loosing the lot to the sea. The sequence turned out fine for a David Attenborough series called 'The Trials of Life'.  The rest as they say is (Natural) history. 

 After 30 years in this career I am still married with two sons (who put me up to doing this Reddit IAmA). I am still working full time.

**Some brief advice on how you can get started**

 My advice to anyone wanting a career in Wildlife film making: Firstly, 15 hours a day on the off chance of capturing a unique piece of behaviour? If you find yourself complaining at all then I suggest you try something else. If you love it and want more, then go for it.

 I am a great believer that you make your own luck and opportunities in this life. Don't just follow the normal path

 If any of you want feedback on video or photographic efforts then I will be keeping a check on this IAmA thread over the next few months or perhaps longer if there is still interest. Remember we all have to start somewhere.

Thank you.

I was the second person in the US to have a full face transplant and third in the world. As far as full and partials go

I know I will get asked as to why I needed one, she was struck by one of the downed lines, I immediately got her off and was struck myself. I do not remember thirty minutes before the accident or thirty days after (drug induced coma). Everything I know is by eye witness accounts. I'm probably fortunate to have not remembered that much pain. Though after waking up, I was still in a lot of pain. My left leg was still being amputated further upas the infection kept spreading. Luckily it finally stopped spreading and my knee was saved.

The requester had some questions:

Q: Does it ever look like what's on the packaging?

We use the actual product when we do photo shoots


Q: What is in TV Dinners that we're happy not knowing about?

Not much really. This is a bit of a misconception. Actually our frozen meals don't need to be formulated with preservatives because freezing is the only preservative we need. The weirdest thing you're going to find on the label is probably xanthan gum, assemble the components in a tray, freeze it, put it in a box, and ship it to you. Pretty simple.


Q: What kind of testing goes on?

We do all sorts of tests. We're given lots of contstraints that we have to meet, within a set of nutritional requirements, without posing any safety concerns, while still delivering on product quality.
So we begin by trying out different formulations in our test kitchen that meet those requirements. We test and test until we get a product that we're happy with

http://www.heartlandconnection.com/news/story.aspx?id=326441#.UKqnUIf7I_g

Well my dad was drinking pretty heavily that night. (counted 18 beers in about 2 hours) and generally speaking when he was drunk there was GOING to be a fight. The night started with just the general passive aggressive wordplay and then progressed to screaming and eventually him telling me to hit him (so that he would have an excuse to beat the shit out of me I guess). Eventually he just snapped and went for a small .22 revolver in another room my mom got to it first and my uncle + mom played keep away with it. Eventually my he wrestled it away from my uncle and started pulling the trigger but my uncle had his finger in between the hammer and managed to throw it outside into the dark. Dad then decided he was leaving and he got his keys and went outside. He came back in 3 minutes later muttering about him leaving was what we wanted him to do. He then made a B-line for my room which contains many assorted knives and weapons. My mom ran into the room and tried to wrestle the knife away from him and he grabbed her hair with one hand and had the knife in the other (kinda like a human shield) and as soon as I saw that I knew I had to do it. So I reached into the drawer and pulled out my .44 mag and shot him in the liver/stomach area.
EDIT: I answered this elsewhere but I can't seem to find it. He didn't die right away. The police arrived and cuffed/interrogated me, and died three days later.

AMA",Or1g1nal1ty,4337, that's the short version. The longer version is a bit of a pain to go over entirely. I was a senior at the time of the massacre, then they began telling the media and the families that I was involved in the killing.

I quickly became a pariah in the area, working on documentaries of all sorts, writing my book, and going from school to school talking about the dangers of bullying. I also spent much time reading, studying, talking to psychologists, experts

But because methamphetamine is so hard to obtain where I live

Also, the way mental health and addiction are treated, and the extent to which the pharmaceutical industry controls government policy.  An example: methamphetamine is available by prescription under the name Desoxyn, for treating narcolepsy and ADHD, but only one company is allowed to make it.  A prescription will cost a person with no insurance about $500 a month, not counting doctor's visits.  The same amount of dextromethamphetamine can be purchased on the street for about $100, or manufactured by an individual for about $10.

Because of my crime, I am now a convicted felon for the rest of my life, barring a pardon from the president of the United States.  I am unable to vote, receive financial aid for education, or own a firearm, for the rest of my life.  I spent one month in jail, after falsely testing positive for methamphetamine, after being court ordered to live at a location far away from all of that

While I was using, it was a positive influence on me.  But I can easily see how a methamphetamine addiction could spiral out of control.

It took 3 years and a trial by jury to clear my name AMA.,Summonme,18808,16916,4018,"Hello Reddit my name is Joel and in the spring of 2005 I was wrongly accused of wanting to kill a student in my high school. As you will read some of the other students involved made some pretty bad statements and I do not blame the girls for reporting them. I maintained my innocence and embarked on a civil lawsuit against the girls. It took 3 years and a trial by jury to clear my name of all wrongdoing.  

Couple things I will say now.

1. I was never expelled from the high school.

2. I transferred to a new high school and graduated.

3. I do not know what happened to the other students involved last I heard they transferred to an alternative school for troubled teens and graduated.

4. Most of the people in the reports testified in the jury trial for the defendants including the principal and officers involved.

5. The trial consisted of them bringing multiple friends in saying I threatened to kill them also. This is actually a very important piece because they tried to paint a picture of me doing this to multiple people.

6. My lawyer was very good and caught the people testifying for them in multiple lies.

Yesterday I saw my ICD nurse and a doctor who had assessed the information from my last discharge and found something interesting.  I explained this in the AMA, Q, R, S, and T.  When I first diagnosed and my ICD implanted, I only really had an R point.  The rest were just little mumbles because my heart was so weak.  But what they discovered is that my heart has gotten so strong, that the T point had gotten high enough that the ICD was counting it as another R wave, it thought my heart was in v-fib at 352 beats a minute, because it *frigging hurts!*  

So my heart had a software bug.  The ICD nurse and a cardiologist logged into my heart using a wireless device, and counts the next R.  They also set it to ""capture"" my heart when it exceeds 180 beats a minute.  When it happens, my pacemaker will start pacing my heart at 190 beats (it is...uncomfortable, like suddenly being anxious about something) then start marching my heart rate down to a safe level.

End result:  **I should never be shocked again, and if so, exactly how much stronger.

**NEW STUFF**
A quick clarification:  I use the word “Tick” to describe the unvoluntary movements and noises my TS causes me to make.  “Tick” is not the proper spelling
1.	 Tick in my personal onomatopoeia of the sound I hear in my head when I tick.
2.	I use words like “Ticky” and “Tickish” when I describe the rate at which I’m ticking

**Ticks:**
I can usually feel a tick coming.  It feels just like the “Point of no return” when you sneeze.  Sometimes I can stop it from happening right away
When I stop it, so you have to hold it.  After a few minutes my whole body is SCREAMING to let the ticks come out.  I feel much better after a tick happens.
A tick for me

*Ticks I exhibit:*
I have both motor and vocal ticks.  To be diagnosed with TS you much have motor ticks and at lease one vocal tick.
I jerk my head at my left shoulder.
My right arm flails up
Sometimes my head jerk and arm flail happens at the same time.
A leg will “kick out”.
I flex the muscles in my arms and leg.
I furrow my browns.
I stretch my eyes very wide and they stick that way for a bit.
I clench my jaw.
I wheeze out all the air in my lungs and hold it.
I make a small “Hm” sound in the back of my throat.
I repeat words or phrases people say to me

**TS and other issues.**
It is common for people with TS to also have ADD, Schizophrenic, or be slightly autistic. (Like Aspergers)
It’s common for us to experience anxiety
I have TS, and I have depression issues.

**Being in public.**
I usually have a good handle of my ticks so I can suppress them or disguise them while I’m in public, I either explain to any strangers who look worried/confused/interested, and if nobody looks worried/confused/interested, I just let it go.

I go to the movies.  I only have a few vocal ticks
The only time I’m ever really embarrassed is when young children mime my ticks when they see them.  They’re just being kids

*School*
Nobody made fun of me in high school.
I tried to go to college, and I failed out.  I probably could try to go again because my symptoms are much less bothersome now, but I don’t want to.

*Personal Life*
It has never affected my friendships or my ability to find a boyfriend.  All my friends have learned to ignore my ticks, they laugh right along with me.  I currently have a GREAT, supportive, loving, and understanding boyfriend.  We live together, and I don’t think he really notices my ticks anymore, unless he ends up getting hit by one.

**Sex**
Yes
Yes, he has learned to ignore it.
If I ever tick enough to ruin the moment

**Treatment**
I currently do not take any kind of medicine.  Medicine is available to me
On sparse occasions I have used THC recreationally.  THC stops all of my ticks.  I am currently not planning on using THC for medicinal purposes, that way it is an option for me, and many other people, if I need it in the future.

**Supression**
I don’t have a way to describe or advise how to suppress ticks.  I just… Do.  I wish I could find the words to describe it

**Videos**
My identity is not really a secret, and you are all strangers.
I don’t think I will be posting a video, but not today.
As for a picture of myself

The basic concept of experiencing orgasm during rape is a confusing and difficult one for many people

There are people who do not believe it's possible for a woman or man to achieve orgasm during rape or other kinds of violent sexual assault.  Some believe having an orgasm under these circumstances means that it wasn't a ""real"" rape or the woman/man ""wanted"" it.

I've assisted more young women than I can count with this very issue.  It often comes up at some point during therapy and it's extremely embarrassing or shameful to talk about.  However once it's out in the open

There have been very few studies on orgasm during rape, I have worked with very few boys/men who reported this.)

In professional discussions
My belief is that as difficult a topic as this is

I was taken to task in my original discussion for not emphasizing that this happens for boys and men as well.  I referenced that above but am doing it again here to make this point clear.

I was verified previously

This is an open discussion and I'm happy to answer any questions.  Don't be afraid if you think it may be offensive as I'd rather have a frank talk than leave people with false ideas.

We are here to discuss the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) which we are striving to reform, and others have been prosecuted and which potentially makes felons out of millions of Americans by criminalizing website terms of service violations.

We hail from across the political spectrum and we have somewhat divergent opinions about what the ideal CFAA would look like.  But we all agree that the CFAA allows law enforcement to engage in frivolous prosecutions and/or to seek penalties that are severely disproportionate to alleged offenses -- and that this stifles innovation and speech and must be fixed.

I had the audacity to hug them back

",repmcgovern,3692,535, I've been one of the leading voices in Congress to overturn the Supreme Court's misguided decision in Citizens United

I recently introduced two constitutional amendments to that effect. The first amendment, HJ Res 21, would overturn *Citizens United* and put a stop to the growing trend of corporations claiming first amendment rights.  This “People’s Rights Amendment” not only addresses corporate rights as they pertain to campaign finance, but is broader in scope to clarify that corporations are not people with Constitutional rights.  Importantly, the amendment clearly protects the people’s rights of freedom of speech, freedom of the press, free exercise of religion, and all other such rights of the people. 

 ( [My floor speech on those two amendments is just about at 100K views on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5IEEv4RVIc) )

I've got a pile of Qs on my old threads following yesterday's SSM decisions so

Per usual

**Quick Background:**


I'm a lawyer living and working in DC. My pet love my whole life has been the Constitution and constitutional law. I do not work as a constitutional lawyer for my day job

My areas of specialization are the First Amendment and legislative procedure. Within the First Amendment I know mostly speech/press/election law issues and legislative procedure is all about our federal legislative system (so everything from item-line veto to the filibuster) are what I love to talk and write about.

I have a general knowledge of most other constitutional provisions

One caveat that I give in all my AMAs - I'm not great on national security law. I know the basics on issues of military tribunals, and executive privilege but questions of indefinite detention, torture, GITMO, and drone strikes are pretty foreign to me. I highly recommend the [Lawfare Blog](http://lawfareblog.com/) for all national security law related interests. The writers there are fantastic and unbelievably knowledgeable.

I *do* know the Espionage Act through my First Amendment forays

One more caveat - I'm happy to dig in to the 2nd Amendment but will warn in advance that I'm not fluent in it. I can discuss the decisions that set the rules but most folks want me to make arguments and, so take any answers to 2A questions with a grain of salt. Happy to talk about the constitutionality of gun control legislation as I see it, but again, I'm not an authority on this one.

A hallmark of this condition is that the pain gets [worse after orgasm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15247725). I have this symptom too; in fact, or simply thinking about a girl I like. This is as bad as it sounds. A few seconds or minutes of pleasure can result in hours, days, or weeks of increased pain.

I’ve tried, from special diets, to physical therapy/stretching/relaxation regimens, to pain medications, to an implanted nerve stimulator. I have seen the very best urologists, neurologists, anesthesiologists, physical therapists

So, kissing (or ANY romantic contact with women), or masturbation. No looking at women in a way that might arouse me (this means absolutely no porn, or even seeing women in revealing clothing). When an attractive girl walks by me on the street, I often have to avert my gaze to avoid getting aroused. And the most difficult part: no sexual thoughts. When I break these rules, I usually sorely regret it. The last time I had sex, I was in bad pain for over 2 weeks. So, etc) in a very long time. My libido is high

Proof/evidence: I have scanned a few [excerpts](http://i.imgur.com/uzeqpzJ.png) from my medical records. Can post more if people are interested.

This condition causes me huge anguish. I feel I am in a mental prison, to hardly being able to date.

There are so many facets to this condition and its impact on my life

Like the first draft, the changes in this draft should prevent the kind of abusive prosecution directed at Aaron Swartz and would help protect other Internet users from outsized liability for everyday activity.  

As our discussions have continued, it will be in honor of Aaron Swartz, and should be seen as a beginning of a concerted effort to bring reform to these broader issues.  To be successful, that effort will likely take substantial time and require sustained and intense support from all of you in a push that will need to exceed our stoppage of SOPA.  
 
I see “Aaron’s Law” as common sense fixes that should be enacted to stop the kinds of abuse Aaron was subjected to from affecting others.  I intend to introduce a final version of ""Aaron's Law"" as legislation soon, when the Internet speaks, lawmakers listen.  I think with enough constructive support we can have an opportunity to pass ""Aaron's Law.""

-How long did it actually take them? 
Took 5 months to complete the car.

-Did you like what they did? 
At first,000 worth of things to it. You can see that [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gYVfNoJJE)

-Did all the stuff actually work? 
They actually take out a lot of the stuff that they showed on TV. Such as the ""pop-up"" champagne

 
-Do you still have the car? 
Unfortunately

-How did you get selected?
It was a casting call at GAS. There were over 200 cars in the parking lot, and from there, they sent it to the producers. A week later they called me back to start shooting. I was in competition with the other 15 contestants. So whoever made the best video would be the one getting their car pimped. In reality, it wasn't true. All of the other ""contestants"" got their rides pimped anyways.

My whole life I have been a big person. I was teased as a kid, I tried hiding in plain sight. Ya know, made jokes about myself being fat, how I was ugly etc. 
But it just seemed to make things worse. I once in a rare occasion tried throwing up my own food. I hated who I was and I so desperately just wanted to change and love myself.

So I did.

I went on the internet, and looked up tons of information about how the body works and what I can do to change, and if there truly was hope for me... Or if I was just a lost cause.
After I completely surrounded myself with as much knowledge as I possibly could
I lost 20 pounds very quickly at the start.
Soon I lost 40 pounds.. Then before I knew it 60 pounds had vanished.. 
By this time
After months and months of intense training

I made it... I'm 210.

I worked out at the YMCA pretty regularly and I knew the whole staff
I couldn't believe it. Me... The fat kid everyone picked on

I posted this request after seeing [Born in the USSR's](http://www.reddit.com/user/born_in_ussr) [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rf9s/i_grew_up_in_the_soviet_union_during_the_cold_war/) about growing up in the soviet union. I think having a chance to talk to the man who oversaw both the collapse of the soviet union and the end of the cold war would be a fascinating historical insight.

EDIT: I just sent this email to a few related organisations

To who it may concern

Hello, IAMA, is designed for users to be able to directly ask questions to notable public figures.
The style is that of an open forum

President Barack Obama

Former Vice President Al Gore

Governor of California

…and many more

But not all of these AMA threads (Ask Me Anything) are authored by big names. There was recently a fascinating thread posted by a former citizen of the USSR
So this is why I am sending this email, would be extremely grateful to have the chance to directly talk to the man who was active in the very highest levels of the Soviet Union. Reddit has a user base in the tens of millions, and an “Ask Me Anything” thread by Mr Gorbachev would be a fantastic opportunity to spread his ideas and experiences with a huge amount of people. It would also be a fabulous historical experience for younger users to be able to directly talk to the last leader of the Soviet Union.

I am not sure exactly who this message will reach

Looking forward to your response

Здравствуйте
Меня зовут X, фокусирующихся на разных областях интересов. Один из этих разделов, IAMA, придуман специально для того, чтобы пользователи могли в письменной форме задать вопросы напрямую выдающимся общественным деятелям. Это происходит в стиле открытого форума, где заметность вопроса пользователя определяется количеством положительных или отрицательных голосов, полученных от других пользователей. Этот процесс приводит к тому, чтобы быть замеченными и получить письменный ответ от общественного деятеля. Среди таких деятелей уже были:

Президент США Барак Обама

Бывший вице-президент Эл Гор

Губернатор Калифорнии Арнольд Шварценеггер

...и многие другие.

Но не все AMA-дискуссии (от ""Ask Me Anything"" - ""спрашивайте меня что угодно"") начаты известными людьми. Не так давно удивительная и очень интересная дискуссия была начата одним из бывших граждан СССР. В ней он детально описывал, как всё изменилось. Именно после успеха этой дискуссии я подумал, как интересно было бы услышать о том, как управлялось это государство, от человека, который сам им управлял. Вот почему я пишу это письмо - сегодня я создал AMA-запрос на Reddit, предложение провести такую дискуссию для Михаила Горбачёва. В данный момент это один из популярнейших запросов в разделе IAMA. Я, был бы в высшей степени благодарен иметь возможность напрямую пообщаться с человеком

Я не вполне уверен, пожалуйста, сообщите мне, хотел ли бы он принять участие в такой дискуссии в виде вопросов и ответов, как описано выше. Я надеюсь, Вы согласитесь со мной в том, что это было бы замечательным опытом для всех участников.

С нетерпением жду ответа

EDIT 5: common question: there are no published reports of recovery of nuerologic function after the diagnosis of brain death using the criteria reviewed in the 1995 American academy of neurology practice parameter. 

EDIT 6: i will spend today answering the remaining question that i haven't answered yet. P.S: i didnt mean to refer to the donors with ""it"" to objectify them, guess is an american thing or just an urban legend, don't see how a doctor could do that to a patient and the diagnostic criteria is really hard to meet with absolutly no false positive reported in the litarature yet. Give me some time and i will answer your questions, if i dont answer to you directly is because it was asked before you came in and i recomend you read all the comments, thanks for all the support and nice questions, this has been a great oportunity to talk to patients and nice people, thanks.

EDIT 6: am kind of surprised that some people are judging my surgical skills based on my command of the english language, but am calling bullshit because he spelled putrid wrong, come on guys! Am also on an iphone...

EDIT 7: a lot of comments about zolpidem's new found ability to improve patients with brain injuries, the surgeon can't know everything and make every decission, thats what the rest of the team are for, and i am sure that when and if zolpidem's ability is well stablished the neurophysiologist in my team would be aware of it as i am aware of new surgical techniques they don't know about yet.

EDIT 8: hey everybody...nods are actually knots

EDIT 9: no longer relevant things

EDIT 10: thanks for being here, try to make a difference in someone elses life. You have a big problem in USA and most countries in E.U were people don't want to become donors and patients have to be implanted with machines for long periods of time and poor quality of life and high risk of complications. This two AMAs have been an intent to bring closer to the people this problem and the people involved in it and humanize the surgeons and other personal involved, know that we feel about you but are glad an happy that together we can help many people out there that really need help. Thanks for asking questions and good bye.

EDIT 11: for last i want to adress the title of the AMA since i have gotten well deserved comments claiming that the title is missleading since braindead patients are considered dead in medical terms even if their organs keep working with life support and drugs. First i apologize if this confussed you or made you feel bad in anyway. but thinking about it i think someone would allways have a problem with this AMA no matter what its name was. WHY? you ask, when people found out they were brain dead, some people would eventually comment they still have some life in them, no matter what the correct definition of brain death is, and they wouldn't be completly wrong. if it was called ""i harvest hearts from brain dead patients"" it would have been probably be the more suitable name, but similar debates would have happen. i picked the title that i taught best described what i wanted to get across the room and that is that this patients hearts are beating and they still have vital signs, and their organs are working in their majority. I also wanted to get across that this is the only case in witch you can legally do something to a patient that would directly end all vital signs and advancing or precipitating the patients death, we in an active manner stop this people's hearts and end the activity of all remaining organs and make the patients unable to live even on lifesupport like they did before. maybe i could have chosen a more suitable title? probably yes

I'm currently working on a new project that I think fans of Wilfred would like. It's called FUNT and is about a bunch of guys who start up an analogue TV Network and try and flog it to old and vulnerable people - to those who don't know any better. 

Also

It's only in pre-pilot phase at the moment so I'd appreciate your thoughts (and views!) on it. You can check it out here - https://www.youtube.com/funtvnetwork

The tech then said ""Well, I gotta tell you, I'm seeing it being much better here, but we'll wait for the doctor to look at it and determine the final numbers.""  That report hasn't come back yet.
They then sent me to radiology, and someone kept taking my blood pressure.  I was not hearing good numbers, but was too busy trying to stay conscious, and vomiting constantly.  Eventually, I think a year later, the doctor said ""I'm going to give you the antidote now.""  WTF?  The antidote...now????  After they put it in my IV, I stopped vomiting
Here are the results of that test:

Time In Exercise Phase 30 S
Max Heart Rate 97 BPM
Max Predicted Heart Rate 177 BPM
Max. Systolic BP 142 mmHg
Max Diastolic BP 64 mmHg
Max Work Load 10
Symptom:   Negative -  Hypotensive Response
ECG:   Negative
Chronotropic Response:   Abnormal
Pretest Probability:   Intermediate
I have not one clue what any of it means.  All I understand is ""hypotensive"" and ""abnormal.""
So they took me back and almost immediately began the nuclear scan.  Cool, and then I was told to rest, don't be around pregnant women, small kids, the elderly, and not get angry, because no one would like it when I was angry (the last is my own embellishment.)
These are the results of that test:
1. Left ventricular ejection fraction of 49%
2. No reversible perfusion defects identified to suggest stress-induced 
myocardial ischemia. 
3. Small fixed apical defect which may relate to physiologic apical 
thinning versus myocardial scar.

**Edit:** Disclaimer/Explanation. Ian is a close relative of mine, responses which I then typed into the AMA the mods told me I could do this prior and it's also what he wanted to do. I thought that AMA's typically only lasted for ~1hour/1.5 hours and had no idea it was expected to go on for quite a bit longer than that.  Due to time he (or I) couldn't attend for that long, had I known I probably would have waited for sometime later next month when he was more likely to have time available. So in this case; please DO shoot the messenger as the slight confusion was all my fault, I probably should have educated myself on AMAs before pitching the idea to him.

We are hoping to make a trip down to the coast (about a 5 hour trip by bus) to see some of Ghana's famous tourist sites and tour one of Ghana's premier universities.

I write with other writers there.  It's the most fun

I have put those childhood dreams on hold and now I have gone from fighting AGAINST people to fighting FOR people. 

Now I am on a pursuit to love people in maybe the most dark, killed, cooked, and eaten. The UN confirmed it, BBC, The Guardian, and CNN reported it. Then in August &amp; September of 2012 I partnered with the oldest university in Congo and their School of Community Development. What I didn't know

We saw 60 Pygmy men, that they own, for the FIRST time in history. We got an agriculturalist from the school to stay and teach the oldest nomadic, hunter gatherer tribe on the planet how to farm. Since then a ripple effect has occurred. We have seen over 120 slaves be set FREE on 60 acres of land and they are getting ready for their SECOND harvest!

BEST THING SO FAR FROM THIS AMA: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/x4rvy/iama_former_playboy_model_turned_hardcore_adult/c5j9tgx

EDIT 1: Holy balls! Sooooo many Q's! I promise they will all get A'd before the day is over. It's overwhelming but i'l push through. I'll take a short break soon and eat and then post some pictures. 

EDIT 2: I didn't mean I was taking a break NOW....jeez....I'm still going strong. Also....if you want pictures I have to take a break eventually to take the pictures. Don't worry...we'll have it all today! Fun times. Everyone just stay cool and remember: We're all friends here to have fun. :)

EDIT 3: Yes, such as: BIOSHOCK (all of them), DARKNESS II, SKYRIM, SAINTS ROW 3, SILENT HILL (all of them, some more than others), MARIO KART

EDIT 4: What do my parents/friends/family think of my career choices: My Mom knows but we don't discuss it. She's supportive though. My Dad knows I do nude modelling but it's too awkward to discuss any more than that. He's also very loving and supportive. No one has cut me off or been nasty to me as a result of my career choices. 

EDIT 5: How do I feel about the negative/bad/degrading parts of the industry: I've chosen to do (mostly) only videos that don't oppress or degrade women. It's been a conscious choice and while I have done some things that I know don't follow the above sentiment
Do I think it's a job for every girl? Hell no. You have to be very strong willed to not succumb to the obvious pressures you'll get some everyone in the industry.

1372859786.0,1hkeok,I got my anonymous cyberstalker of 1.5 years arrested for harassing me and threatening to shoot up the college where I teach. AMA!,cyberstalked,13101,11436,2322,"Hey Reddit!


As this case is still going through the court system, a copy of a syllabus I used as a college adjunct, and a screen shot of my stalker's charges that were posted online. [They've verified this proof](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hkeok/i_got_my_anonymous_cyberstalker_of_15_years/cav6qj2) and you can also quasi-verify by checking out the posts I made about this [in r/askreddit one year ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s9va3/ive_been_cyberstalked_for_8_months_police_wont/) and [in r/privacy when I was in the midst of everything just a few months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1889gy/i_want_to_identify_my_psychoticviolent/).

**The basic story:**

I'm a female adjunct professor who TA'd for a course 2 years ago. That summer I received disturbing, and affectionate text messages from an unknown number. This soon progressed to email messages, facebook messages, and then every social networking site I was connected to. The more I blocked the incoming messages or deleted myself off the internet, the more the stalker persisted and found new ways to get to me, e.g. by emailing and facebook messaging/stalking my roommate, close friends and family and threatening to kill them if I didn't come back online or respond. The stalker soon learned of my home address, and threatened to physically harm me by coming to my apartment


I continued monitoring just my old inactive facebook account to keep the stalker preoccupied. Eventually, and other behavior issues she was having, but she was difficult and refused to attend. In the meantime, she, the stalker, sent me a message saying that she wanted to ""shoot up"" the school and discussed how she was going to steal her uncle's guns so that she could come and do it when she came in for the meeting. I informed me school and my detective and she was arrested. She spent 2 nights in jail, was ROR'd



AMA

Here are some things I'd love to talk about:

- more details/particulars about my stalker's behavior
- anonymity/privacy on the internet
- the actual privacy level of social networking sites
- the law around stalking and harassment / privacy
- police mentality around these cases
- tracking a stalker: personal and legal documentation/reporting

*Why would I do this AMA if the case is ongoing?* - A news reporter recently wanted to run a story on this case. I refused to comment because I didn't want it to get misinterpreted and I didn't want my name to be attached to my comments (for my stalker to easily find/see). Instead I'm taking my story into my own hands and using as a moment to educate anonymously. Yes

1332432253.0,r8ib4,I am a 23yr male with a rare disorder called Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita and extreme body asymmetry. AMA,wallyroos,5970,4314,2409,"I am 23 years old and have been dealing with this all my life. Recently I have learned a bit more about it I thought I would make an AMA for anyone curious about having to live with something like this. I cannot really tell you much about the disorder as besides a knee surgery when I was younger to even out leg bone growth

My body is split right down the middle with the left side being larger than the right in every way. Bone growth, finger length, even my nether bits.

Some pictures are nsfw but no full body nudity. Please note I am fat and it just makes it a bit more extreme.

I can provide more pictures if requested. The one this I ask of you reddit is please don't tell me to lose weight. I have lost quite a bit yet it only comes off of the right side. I'm still trying.

Other than that ask anything you want. And if anyone knows of a specialist I would appreciate any info.

It was actually a pretty long process. I saw a facebook (!) ad promising $30, what I wanted to do with my life, etc. Photos, SAT scores, GPA, college information, family history information

I had to be cleared by a psychologist to make sure I wasn't crazy

The medical process was this:

After going on birth control for about a month, as I am a full time student and I was going in almost every day, ha. Basically, they would take my blood to check how the hormones were doing, and give me an ultrasound to check on my eggs. The hormones make your ovaries become super fertile, so there are tens of eggs that become really large. The week before and after the surgery I was very bloated and it hurt to move much.

The surgery involved no cuts

My spending habits have not changed, and buy delicious expensive things like raspberries and chai tea slightly more often. 

No regrets so far.

.A little about myself 


I have been competing for the last 4 years as a Natural Bodybuilder and coaching others around nutrition and training since 2011.

[This is what I look like today] (http://i.imgur.com/YcHpoMs.jpg)

[This is what I looked like last year] (http://i.imgur.com/TJYmj2Q.jpg)

[This is what i looked like 4 years ago] (http://i.imgur.com/ZMVSlGR.jpg)

[This was 6 months after I started working out] (http://i.imgur.com/DJ6JwlI.jpg)


**Stats**

Age: 24
Resides: Toronto
Contest Weight: 165lbs
Off-Season Weight: 180lbs
Height: 5’7 
Marital Status: Married

My outlook on health and fitness has changed dramatically since I first started in 2008

Here is some insight :

**3-5 years Ago** 

*Training: 3x a week

*Nutrition: 2 meals a day

*Philosophy: If I miss a meal or workout its ALL OVER

http://i.imgur.com/ZMVSlGR.jpg

**1-2 years Ago**

*Training: Each body part 1x/week, 20-30 sets 6-12 reps, Cardio 7 days a week 1 hour a day.

*Nutrition: 6 Meals a day, Sweet Potato, Brown Rice, Green Veggies. No counting macro nutrients just the type of food. 

*Philosophy: Go hard or go home. If I don't struggle then I havent worked. If I miss a meal or workout I am a failure but keep going until you are PERFECT. I need my supplements at all times, didnt care about nothing but bodybuilding.

**Over the last 6 months** 

*Training : Daily Undulating Periodization Training model, Monday/Wednesday/Friday upper body Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday Lower Body, Cardio 4x a week totally 2.5 hours (mix between HIIT and LISS)

*Nutrition : Flexible Dieting, making and eating healthy alternatives to the food I love , not being bound to eating at certain times and certain types of food, making sure solid amounts of fiber and micronutrient intake.
 
*Philosophy: Live a balanced life, don't let health and fitness dominate my life. Strive for excellence in multiple areas of life.

I want to share what I have learned through my experiences with the health and fitness community so hopefully people can live a more balanced life while still striving towards their health and fitness goals. 

That's why I started Live Young Dream Big. To challenge the ideology of Perfection and share through my own life The Less Than Perfect Approach to a balanced life.

http://imgur.com/rX91U

Cochlear implants are looked down upon by many in the deaf community/culture as its seen as ""trying to become hearing"" and the thought that it would destroy ASL (which I'm proficient in.) The decision to get them myself was a very hard choice but I did it for my children

Due to being able to wear hearing aids while growing up I got to experience both cultures as my entire family is hearing and I spent time in a program called Total Communication where we first learned SEE (Signing Exact English) and various speech therapy classes. We eventually switched to ASL and I also attended the Michigan School For The Deaf.

I'm glad I could provide a topic like this for discussion and no matter what views you have on this topic it is very interesting hearing from everyone. Thank you very much!

1373472487.0,1i0jh7,IAMA architect who's main interest is high efficiency affordable homes - AMA.,Logan_Chicago,3308,1674,1208,"**WHY:**

This was started after I replied to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1hxngl/what_is_the_biggest_way_people_waste_money/caz11mm) and [a few people asked for an AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1hxngl/what_is_the_biggest_way_people_waste_money/caz7v4h).

**WHAT I DO:**

Currently I work for an architecture firm in Chicago. Previously I worked for an [architectural engineer](http://www.alltheclevernamesweretaken.blogspot.com/2012/02/picturequote.html) who designed the mechanical systems for some of the most energy efficient buildings in Chicago. ([1](http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/theskyline/2009/07/going-net-zerofor-effect-1stofitskind-home-in-chicago-will-produce-as-much-energy-as-it-uses.html), [2](http://www.alltheclevernamesweretaken.blogspot.com/2011/05/returning-hate-for-hate-multiplies-hate.html), [3](http://www.alltheclevernamesweretaken.blogspot.com/2009/12/picturequote.html)).

My main interest is affordable energy efficient homes. There are many ways to make a building energy efficient, and attractive at the same time is the challenge. There are many people who say they can do this, but there are few actual construction companies and architects who are truly interested in this. Telling someone their home will cost 5%-15% more than a home of a similar size is not a great selling point. Also, banks rarely see the value in it, although things are slowly changing.

The main software I use for energy modeling is PHPP (passive house planning package). It's a very intense excel spreadsheet that requires a good knowledge of physics and a decent amount of coffee to operate. For drawings I use [Revit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_Revit) which is essentially CAD 2.0.

Also, what you're trying to achieve, etc.

**PROOF:**

[This is all the posts tagged architecture from my blog](http://www.alltheclevernamesweretaken.blogspot.com/search/label/architecture). If you scroll down there's a picture of my degree.

[Here's a post announcing this AMA](http://www.alltheclevernamesweretaken.blogspot.com/2013/07/reddit-ama.html).

**DISCLOSURE:**

Legally I cannot call myself an architect as I am not yet licensed. Technically I'm an intern architect according to AIA definitions. To become licensed in the US you need:

* A professional or masters degree depending on the state
* 5
* Pass 7 tests of which the pass rate is 60%-80% per test. If you fail one you can't take it again for 6 months. You have 5 years to complete them or it all resets. Each tests costs $210 to take.

That being said in the state of IL I can still legally design single family homes of a certain size [without a license](http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=1340&amp;ChapterID=24), [3](http://alltheclevernamesweretaken.blogspot.com/2012/11/jatoba-and-aluminum-coffee-table.html), [4](http://logantreed.tumblr.com/post/50416909244)).

**EDIT:** I will answer everyone's questions as I get to them. There's a lot so it may take a few days. Please CTRL-F to see if others have asked the same question.

In May of last year I was having sex with my girlfriend and fractured my penis. This fracture resulted in what is called Peyronie's Disease

Me and two of my friends (who may share their experiences in a bit) had parylene coated neodymium magnets [implanted into our fingertips](http://i.imgur.com/Vrg0s.jpg) in October of last year. We are in no way the first to do this, why the hell we would want to do something like this. 

My implants have allowed me the ability to ""see"" magnetic fields. Any device that has alternating current flowing through an inductive load throws off substantial amounts of magnetic energy. I can feel the shape

They have changed my life
So please; AMA.


Why did I have it done: [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tl7pn/iama_24yo_electrical_engineer_with_magnets/c4nls5w) is about the best reason.



**EDIT: Sorry all


**UPDATE**

Alright


* **Why?**

*Because science.*

* **What if you need an MRI?**

*I am concerned about this. I don't want people to think that I'm blowing it off. I do understand the awe inspiring magnetic field that a magnetic resonance imager produces. I do understand that there is a possibility that it could cause harm. From what I understand, I do intend on making sure that any technician that would me giving me an MRI knows about the implants, because I guarantee that he is going to understand what could happen far better than I would.* 

*Now, it did not cause any damage. The implants are small enough that it shouldn't be much of an issue at all.*

* **How about other strong magnets?**

*Well, it will cut off the blood flow and the implant will reject. So I generally don't get too close to a super strong magnet. I've been near some HUGE magnetic fields like monstrous permanent magnet motors and big welders, and that was just fun. It feels crazy.*

* **Won't you break _______?**

*Probably not. My implants only have a weak magnetic field (~600uT)

* **How painful was it?**

*Quite. There was a rather sizable incision made into my fingertip

* **Won't they reject?**
 
*There is always the possibility. My implants are coated in Parylene

* **Can I do this without the implant?**

*Absolutely! You won't have the same level of sensitivity that I do

* **What does it feel like?**

*Well


* **What about playing the guitar?**

*I'm not boss enough to be able to play any instrument. Sorry


* **Are they removable?**

*Yeah... It'd just take a scalpel and some ice. I'd rather not have it come to that though*

* **Do you regret getting them?**

*Not even the slightest bit.*

One such was cute but chubby girl, she knocks on my door and asks if she can sleep next to me for all the other beds were taken and the couch was as well, I told her sure thing!

Anyway, I get way to into and really start thrusting as does she. Are rhythm failed and she violently thrusted one way and I the other. POP! The loudest noise popped from inside her and extreme pain filled my entire groin region. I literally passed out for 2-3 mins. By then my brother and his girlfriend were around me and they the girls were assessing the damage. I was already starting to bruise and demanded to be taken to the hospital. Anyway, the prognoses was not good. I had severely fractured (still called fracturing even no bones are involved) my penis. In his words (the worst I've ever seen.)

I ha d an operation to fix the tears and whatnot

What I had installed (lol) was an inflatable penile prosthesis. Once things are starting to look like I may get lucky, but it does allow for me to achieve orgasm. Anyway, This story also doubles for my most embarrassing so, shoot me any questions or stories of your own!

The scales shed constantly and there's a much higher skin turnover rate than a normal person, usually pieces ranging in size between my pinkie and thumbnails. It's messy and weird and actually very painful if it's not kept incredibly well moisturised and then oils used to hold the moisture in. The stuff I used for the first 21 years of my life was about 90% paraffin and literally melted on my skin if the weather was too hot. If you don't keep it hydrated, the scales tighten together and the under layer below the skin is exposed in between the scales, and the gaps show as red skin with no protection, and it hurts like hell. 

Other aspects of the condition are issues with temperature regulation (I can't sweat) and light sensitivity

I use heavy moisturisers and I've been on roaccutane for about a year, except for when I want to have children.

Here's me with the absolute best my skin could ever look without roaccutane, since I did a lot of work to make my face look normal.

I woke up beaten with no memories outside of a burger king in 2004. Any identification I had was stolen as well. The Amnesia was presumed to have been caused by an injury that knocked me unconscious. The United States government still doesn't have a clue as to who I am. Even after eight years, nor been able to live a normal life.

 Hi, shoot me questions (not bullets). By way of background:   

When the cast of Warner Bros. film version of “Gangster Squad” was preparing to stage the movie’s final confrontation – a wild Tommy Gun shoot-‘em-up between the crew of LAPD cops and the henchmen of the hoodlum Mickey Cohen – Ryan Gosling asked me, two had been shot and wounded on the job, but before they joined the unit. And the only one killed after the squad was formed, the giant Texan “Jumbo” Kennard, died not in a hail of bullets but when his car struck a bus on a rain-soaked Wilshire Boulevard after a night of drinking. In the film version of  “Gangster Squad,” in contrast, one of the squad had already been knocked off by Mickey’s men and another was about to get it in the shootout being staged as Gosling and Josh Brolin stormed an historic L.A. hotel where the film’s Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) was holed up. 

The embellishment should surprise no one familiar with the ways of Hollywood, Warner Bros. made no secret of the cinematic liberties being taken. As a number of Reddit commentators noted yesterday, the film did not even describe itself as “based on” a true story, it opted for the lesser “inspired by.” On location that night, as Gosling and Brolin grabbed their machine guns to have it out with Sean Penn, the main producer, Dan Lin, most basically, the Tommy failed to fire. 

I bring this up because of the extensive discussion on Reddit yesterday inspired by a wonderfully provocative post by the granddaughter of Sgt. Jack O’Mara, “The movie butchered my grandfather’s life.”  Well, I first met the real Sgt. O’Mara in 1992 and spent many afternoons in his living room, and soon after met the roguish Sgt. Jerry Wooters (the character now played by Gosling), all while researching what first became a series of articles in the Los Angeles Times, “L.A. Noir: Tales from the Gangster Squad,” then recently was expanded into the nonfiction book,” which indeed is quite different from the film. So

Thanks again to you all and to reddit and the IAmA mods! Cheers!

edit: I hadn't mentioned the financial aspect of this event. I owe the state $108, I have a 15 year sentence. It was originally $488,000 that was owed to the state, they would call it owing the victims, the judge wanted to ""give me a chance"" and dropped it to $108,000 the rest I'll probably be sued for. Basically to get it expunged I need to pay off the $108,000 within the 15 years

Often asked questions:

-Sex?

It's hard to get lucky in an Islamic country.


-What bike?

Honda Africa Twin. I bought the bike specifically for the trip. It was 2nd hand, heated grips, huge airhorn, steel tube protection frame, aluminium panniers, etc. Also a full service &amp; new tires. All together I think the bike &amp; luggage weighs around 350kg.

-Navigation?

I took maps along of every part of my route. All can be bought online. The GPS helps

-Visa?

Before leaving, but there is no way around it. You can get agencies to do it for you, but that can cost a lot of money. You can find them on the net.

The Turkmen visa was the hardest to get. Normally, and leave. So I told them that I would be entering from Iran in order to go to Uzbekistan. I asked for 6 days visa, considering the distance I would be travelling that would give me a day to visit the capital and an extra day in case of emergencies.

-Money?

Some of the countries visited were cash only (for example Iran, India, Nepal, China). So you have to bring lots of US$ with you (yes, they accept the US$ anywhere, really anywhere). I carried some on my body, and some was hidden on the bike.

-Costs (EURO)?

Bike was about 3-4K, paperwork &amp; guides 1K. Add maybe 1K for things I forgot.

-Dangers?

I took a security course in the UK before I left. They cater to journalists &amp; tourists that go to 'difficult' countries. Their analysis was that the biggest danger would be the traffic in India! I took normal precautions, next to the reception. And, no, I didn't bring any guns (why Americans have such a fascination for guns, I'll never understand).

Contrary to popular opinion

-Repairs/spare parts

I took a pair of tires with me to switch just before Turkmenistan. I also sent a pair ahead to China, it's really hard if not impossible to get anything for such a (big) bike. I suffered no problems, except a flat tire in China due to a huge iron nail. I also carried spare inner tubes and an airpump. I'm quite handy with tools &amp; repairs, so that was no problem. I took plenty tools along.

-Food &amp; lodging

You can get food anywhere (duh), and I had some camping/survival food with me, just in case. I also carried a tent, sleeping bag and simple cooking set. I camped in the desert of Iran and Turkmenistan (amazing).

-Route (loop in China)

I wanted to cross the desert, sand and then some more sand. So I made that loop (clockwise). Cool, you can see that desert from space!

-General

I found people on average everywhere very friendly and sympathetic to my travels. People in remote places are thrilled to see strangers visit them, the rich have cars, the poor ride bikes .. so if you're on a bike, even from the west, you can't be rich .. that decreases the distance / creates empathy.

I also 'discovered' that:

-governments suck

-Iranians don't hate the west

A few more beers and some Googling later we found the island of Pohnpei, wow the locals with some kick-ups, play a game, win and become local legends forever! 

Not exactly. 

After a 48 hour flight we touched down on an island unlike anything we had ever seen. It was beautiful

From this moment our mission became clear: Help Pohnpei create something pure and noble to call their own - a team capable of competing and winning their first game. Away from the over-commercialized trappings and glitz of the modern game

But, I got 3rd degree sun burns, Paul got boils - yes boils, ...and we didn't have a working toilet. Nevertheless, inspired by our players, many of whom walked miles to and from training in the pummeling rain, we flew them off the island (in many cases for their first time) to face island rivals and Pacific soccer powerhouses

We won.

tl:dr With no money and experience I flew to a small Pacific Island and coached their soccer team to their first international victory.

Woke up at 12AM to cops screaming with their flashlights and guns held out telling me not to fucking move, and they proceeded to search me. I ended up on the curb for 10 minutes in my underwear while they berated me, telling me times are tough but you're not allowed to do this, what drugs are you on, etc. etc. They found nothing, they said to leave. I did a U-Turn, opened the gate to the shop, locked it and gave them the finger.

Here are the basic questions I get:

**How much did it cost?**

Around $5

**What size were you before? And now?**

I was a 32G and now I'm around a 34D.

**Why would you get it/You're slapping God in the face/People pay for big boobs**

I had really bad back pains

**How much boobage did they remove?**

They took around 3/4lb from each

**Will the scars fade?**

They'll always be there

**Did they give you a lift?**

Yes! Typical reductions (except in the uncommon cases in which it's liposuction only) essentially take a wedge out of your boobs and move the nipple up.  It results in a lifted breast.

**Did they make your areolas smaller?**

Yep. It's procedure

I was conscripted to fight for the Soviets, captured by the Germans, surrendered on the Western front, married a German woman and started a new life in the US. AMA",OldSoldierOpa,1216, and we'll be typing out the answers for Mouna's Opa (German for grandfather), and if necessary we'll answer more tomorrow. Here's our summary of his story:
 
 
**Pre-War**

Born on a farm in Armenia, and confiscated all of the livestock. At 16, I escaped from the farm and fled to Yerevan, Armenia. I managed to enter veterinary school, attended for three years, and was conscripted into the Soviet army in 1941. 
 
 
**War in the Caucasus**

The Germans soon pushed into the Caucasus Mountains, and the Soviets defended fiercely. While fighting in the mountains I was injured from a hand grenade explosion, with over 26 shrapnel pieces in my body. I was transported to Sochi on the Black Sea to a hospital and in November I was sent back out to fight back in the mountains. 

While fighting again the Germans surrounded our battalion, and we suffered heavily through the night, with nearly half of my fellow soldiers freezing. Somehow I survived. We marched for four days into a valley that separated Georgia from Russia.

I was marched to a prison camp in a small city in southern Russia called Maykop, most definitely kill us for surrendering. Most chose to march towards German lines, though many died during that march. With so many wounded horses I was given the chance to show my veterinary skills and was given a position as an assistant veterinarian for almost three years with the German veterinarian.
 
 
**The War Ends**

Eventually we ended up in Austria, but we only had about 5 or 6 hours to make it to the Russian line. 
 
 
**Fleeing to the American Lines**

Taking my time and giving my horse plenty of rest, and just like that he let us go. I found work on a farm in Austria. When we learned that the area of Austria we were in was possibly part of Czechoslovakia, which would be Soviet territory, and fearing for our lives, we fled to an UNRA refugee camp in Germany and sought work.
 
 
**Post-War and moving to the US**

As a free man, married in 1946 and had two children (including Mouna's mother). After that we came to the US by boat in 1951 in hopes of something better (my first choice was actually to move to Australia, but at the Australian consulate I was rejected because I am a Muslim). We had another child, lived and worked on farms, lived in New York City, worked any job necessary, moved to Boston, had a stroke

I started playing poker about 9 years ago, and starting building my bankroll in cash games.  In 2006, I played my first couple of tournaments and made my first televised final table at the WSOP.  I somewhat infamously busted 4-bet shoving 52s and running into AA in a hand that Norman Chad referred to as a ""blowup of monumental proportions"" or something along those lines.

Though I had some early success, I played and won a few tournaments including the NAPT Mohegan Sun for $750,000.  That win catalyzed my signing with Pokerstars and my return to a career as a pro, this time as a tourney donkey rather than a cash game pro who dabbled in tournaments.  I'm still not convinced poker as a career is fully healthy or meaningful, but I'm doing everything I can to make it that.

I have since graduated from law school and also become the highest earning female poker player of all time

I am also, and a strong supporter of civil rights (LGBT and otherwise).  I am engaged to my wonderful fiancee and will be married in August of this year in New York.

I'll be back in 2 hours - at 2PM Pacific time.  What do you wanna know?

OK - it's about that time to head out.  I've had a lot of fun with this... thanks reddit,False,self,t5_2qzb6,1362096493.0,gaming,,t3_19ex5p

1297431326.0,fjfby,"IAmA Director of an ISP who was the first person to ever challenge the constitutionality of the USA PATRIOT Act's ""National Security Letter"" provision.  AMA. ",NickCalyx,2883,1358,469,"I was concerned with the legitimacy of the National Security Letter (NSL) [I received](http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/4610_001_redactednsl.pdf) and I had concerns that the client was being targeted because of political speech.  I believed the FBI was demanding personal, telephone number,” account number

I refused to comply with the demand for information.  Instead, I decided to file a challenge to the constitutionality of NSLs.  After a few bizarre and Kafkaesque discussions (*Q: had I broken the gag order by telling my lawyer? A: according to a literal reading of the NSL, yes I broke it several times over telling my lawyer, the NYCLU lawyer, and the ACLU lawyers.  Q: would a hood be put over my head and would I be dragged away for violating the gag by telling lawyers and filing a suit? A: nobody knew for sure - the original law was unclear as to the penalty*) I became the plaintiff in a court case originally known as ""[Doe v. Ashcroft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doe_v._Ashcroft)"" which was filed in 2004.    If you have been following [the news recently](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/Tea-Party-Tally/2011/0209/Patriot-Act-upset-vote-Can-tea-party-lawmakers-liberals-be-friends) you will see that 7 years later, the after-effects of the constitutional challenge are still being felt.  

As the years passed and the person who held the office of Attorney General changed, and finally Doe v. Holder.  

The constitutional challenge resulted in the NSL provision being [repeatedly](http://www.lawsof.com/page/U.S.-District-Court-Strikes-Down-Statutory-Amendments-Made-by-U.S.-Patriot-Act.html) declared [unconstitutional](http://www.technewsworld.com/rsstory/59218.html) in the courts. ( As an aside, we have learned a lot of information after the DoJ Inspector General performed [several](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2007/03/fbi_misuses_und/) [audits](http://www.wboc.com/Global/story.asp?S=6202763&amp;nav=QEMt) of the use of NSL's and found [widespread abuse](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/20/AR2007032000921.html).  For years, these developments were in the news and NSLs were debated in congress.  I have strong views about the need for reform of the NSL statute and it is hard to accurately describe my frustration at being unable to participate in the public debate.

In 2007, and it is not what is necessary to defeat the terrorists.*""   Unfortunately so far that promise has not yet come true.  In fact, their use has reached epidemic levels.  To get a sense of how many of these letters have been used - during just a 3 year period between 2003 and 2006 the FBI put out nearly *1 NSL per 1000 Americans*.  I don't believe there can possibly be that many terrorism or espionage suspects in the country.

For the years I was completely gagged

As part of a settlement agreement, [The Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/09/AR2010080906252.html), and in [Wired](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/08/nsl-gag-order-lifted/) magazine.  I have appeared on [National Public Radio](http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2011/01/21/04) and on the [Democracy Now!](http://www.democracynow.org/2010/8/11/gagged_for_6_years_nick_merrill) radio show.

Sometimes when people ask what being partially un-gagged means, and there is the possibility of prosecution if I mess up any time I discuss the issue. However I feel that it is important enough to take that risk, because the very bedrock principles our country was founded upon are at stake.   I think the FBI has abused its gag power to squelch debate on the issue.  There are recipients of hundreds of thousands of NSLs out there - some of the recipients of those letters might be reading this right now - who cannot talk openly without fear of going to prison.

I realize that maybe some of these questions maybe answered elsewhere and/or common knowledge

Questions: 

1. Aside from doubling as James Bond
1. Since you had very little to say on the show, have any examples?
1. Not many people have the opportunity to teach a celebrity something new
1. I understand that tensions were pretty high when you decided to reveal yourself as the Stig.  Between the BBC trying to prevent your book from being published and Jeremy's rantings

1. Nope. Unless you count that the last season I started dating one of the show's production assistants (the showbiz equivalent of an intern). We were together for 7 years.

2. Bill Daniels. Jesus

3. ABC and the show runners decided that there were too many other shows in our demographic with ""nerd"" characters (Urkel

4. Yep. We got to the point where we barely had to rehearse -- acting with Ben became like having a psychic twin.

I'll tell you anyway. ;)

3. I don't know for sure but I think they just wanted to get away from the classic nerdy character thing we had going. Topanga also became more and more mainstream as time went by.

--------**UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE**--------



**ORIGINAL VIDEO OF THE BEATING

**There will be a live video AMA this evening on Vokle at 7 central time.  Thursday, 8 eastern.**  http://www.vokle.com/series/19652-hillary-adams

Reddit was the reason my mother and I actually have ground to stand on now

I've gotten messages from literally all over the world, Netherlands, Australia, France, Mexico, the UK...  I had no idea it was such a global issue, that so many people were being hurt in their own homes.  I guess nobody really knows how to talk about it, that silence has been broken

Thirty days ago, but many other people out there who may not know what they're dealing with at home.

And now

Prologue:

There was barely a motive except for being frustrated at Dad's harassment over text messaging to both myself and my mother.  My mother would call me and cry

A little over a year ago, a Mercedes!), and then yelled at me whenever I used it to transport anyone other than myself.  The agreement was that I was to return to college, and when I missed deadlines (my fault entirely), he told me to either purchase the car from him or return it and he'd release my school savings to me.  I told him ""speak of the devil, I'm waiting on a callback for a better job"".

Later that day, because I'd dared earlier to reach out to friends on twitter about his treatment of me and my mother.  He couldn't stand that I found a solution and was even more upset that I'd said a few words suggesting he was not perfect, and set me up for failure by demanding the car back and stranding me without a vehicle in the spread-out San Antonio, Texas, so there was barely any reliable way I could hold a job or go to college now.

I was so frustrated by his behavior that I uploaded the video privately and showed Mom, Dad started harassing me about the car again, demanding it be returned.  I finally said ""do that and I release a video to the public of you beating the shit out of me"".

His response?  ""Do that if it will make you feel better.  You were never spanked but obviously should have been.""

**Q:  Why not solve it in private rather than going to the internet?**
A:  Dad was a County Court-At-Law Judge.  This meant he reigned over the county police, and the two times he did have an opponent, he won by a landslide.  During the divorce when Mom felt threatened enough to call the police, Dad would talk to them and they'd mysteriously leave.  She tried talking to a counselor, but Dad had filled him in beforehand on the ""correct"" way to treat her complaints.  Whenever I tried to say I needed help and was being treated horrifically at home, people would scoff and tell me what a wonderful father I had.  THERE WAS NO WAY TO SOLVE IT PRIVATELY, because Dad would squash any outreach.  He controlled the community.  Anyone remotely employed with the government who knew how he really operated was scared to death to come forward, and I got fed a big ream of red tape.  Everything was useless.  He had always been winning and it wasn't changing.

My father once told me that the media could be considered like another branch of the law system, then the internet was mine.  And if the internet could keep tabs on the law, then...

I anonymously posted the video to /pol/, and comments started appearing.  That's when the fire bit me and I posted it to Reddit.

**Q:  So your motive was...**
A:  To shock Dad into changing.  I wanted him to see that there were a number of people who were saying this was wrong.  It was wrong what he did.  I wanted him to see it and the comments and be horrified and apologize.  I wanted to turn a mirror on him.  Instead

**Q:  But wait!  He says you were caught stealing!**
A:  I used KaZaA to download video game music and terrible AMVs.  All he knew was that something was potentially illegal.  I was one of the best kids in town, we didn't know what drugs and alcohol even were.  We didn't even litter.  Our idea of a fun time was going to a movie and Walmart.  So any tiny thing that I did that could even be perceived as wrong was blown out of proportion.

**Q:  He also says you weren't hurt.**
A:  Pfffffthahahahaha, in which he said he was the ""primary"" support for me after I was out of the house, which is frankly a load of bullshit.  I work and my boyfriend works.  We pay our own bills, and we always have.  The only things my father paid for was my car and my phone, so he had control over my transportation and communication.  The perfect puppet strings.

**Q:  Why have you forgiven your mother and not your father?**
A:  Mom and I have always been best friends, a special needs baby, and guided me into college classes at age 15, and scholarships like the Coca-Cola Scholarship.  Without her I don't know if I'd be this far.  When I showed her the video, she was horrified.  She was broken.  She cried and stammered apologies to me for three days.  When Dad saw the video, he didn't think anything of it.

My grandmother once said a long time ago that it would take the entire world to get my father to change...  Now we have it, the more upset I am becoming.  I still need counseling myself.

No one at all should have to understand abuse or how it works, if you have never been manipulated or abused, think about inflammatory comments very carefully.  There are lots of people out there who share this unfortunate boat and it won't help a thing to make light of it.  Research battered wives, Stockholm Syndrome, narcissism, psychopathy, and the cycle of abuse that keeps people locked in.  It's frightening and absolutely anyone 100% can fall into it under the right circumstances.  Don't feed that line of ""I would have just walked away"".  **No

Alrighty

I really hope you'll join me tomorrow evening for the video broadcast!  :3  I want to talk about experience with the media and what Dr. Phil was like and all that.

But most of all, and you saved countless other people out there too.  I myself had no idea that video was so bad until you guys and /pol/ told me.  Thank you.

1. When my parents found out

2. They did confront me. See above.

3. They did not tell the family members. They don't want anyone to know. My dad is really high up in the company he works for (Regional Vice President of the company)

4. They were so angry. But its been roughly 6 months or more since they found out and they're pretty cool with it. They still HATE it and harass me for it sometimes but its whatever. They love me now.

Hi everyone. First let me introduce myself. My name is Kevin Moore and for roughly 12 years I have created adult movies for a living.

What exactly do I do?
I shoot both stills and video

What is your background?
I am 40 years old and did not make the plunge full time into doing this until 2000. Prior to that I grew up in Western Massachusetts. I was a UNIX SysAdmin for the UMASS campus in Amherst

Somewhat ironically this earlier comment on Reddit references a thread I have done on SA talking about my time in the industry: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/di6sy/as_requested_i_used_to_shoot_porn_ama/c10ee59

How exactly did you get into this?
I can partially thank Mitt Romey. Somewhat long story, I tried to start an amateur adult site around my girlfriend at the time. I did this out of my dorm room. 

I eventually moved into a full time career at UMASS working as a junior SysAdmin

Mitt Romney became the Governor of Massachusetts and he gut funding to public education. Since UMASS was a state school, which included a small package to take care of you. I knew that my life was at a crossroads. I could stay at Umass and weather the storm or I could take a huge risk and due the voluntary layoff, use that money to relocate to LA and pursue shooting adult full time. I chose the layoff and moved to LA. 

My initial time in LA was at first very rough. Luckily I had made some good contacts by this point, who is somewhat an icon in the industry. He was a long time performer in the 70's and 80's. He was now a producer/director at Evil Angel. Joey and I kind of hit it off. His assistant the time quit and he needed another assistant. He asked me if I wanted to do it and I started working for him. That really began the day to day shooting and working in the trenches. 

I learned so much from Joey and I spent many years working for him. From Joey I met John Leslie and Rocco Siffredi and John Stagliano and began working at times for all of them. Eventually, while also producing content for other companies. My list of credits include: Evil Angel, Hustler, Jules Jordan, Brazzers, Smash, Pink Visual, Sweetheart Video

What do you shoot with?
For photos I used to be a Nikon guy, but I dropped all my Nikon gear and glass and reinvested in all Canon gear. I was using the MarkII heavily, but now use two MarkIII's and recently picked up the 1DX. I shoot both stills and video with these cameras. I no longer use video cameras. Prior to shooting with the DSLR's, I was using a solid state Sony EX3 camera. It is still a great video camera, but the quality you can get out of the current DSLR's is amazing. I use a wide variety of after market products to make shooting easier with DSRL's. 

Why do you do this?
That is a complicated question and if I were to get insightful I am sure it has to do somewhat with my upbringing and also my outlook. I was raised in a very serious irish catholic household. Sex was a massive taboo

What I now know as an adult is that I feel very strongly that adults should be allowed to express themselves sexually with other consenting adults. Repression is a terrible thing. Porn to me is escapism entertainment. It is like people watching ""professional"" wrestling. Everyone knows its fake

Today marks the longest period of time I've gone without it since I started. Four years of snorting and smoking. I never fixed

I had the help of Prince Valium for the first couple days. That helped me sleep and maintain a bit of my sanity. 

The worst part, were the *super* intense muscle aches. It hurts down to your bones and makes you grit your teeth until you feel like they're coming loose. 

But those have since passed. My nose is still a little runny and I'm shitting like a fire hose. So basically it feels like I'm getting over a bout with the flu. I never puked or itched

I'm a little depressed. Nothing very serious. I went out today for the first time since Wednesday. I forgot how much more laborious everything is without smack

I find that I have to pump myself to do small things. Yesterday

I've ""tried"" a few times in the past to kick smack. And

1364135697.0,1awx2u,[Modpost] Some changes regarding IAmA requests and comments,IAmAMods,3408,1916,552,"TL;DR at the top: New rule on celebrity requests

1. **New Rule for Celebrity Requests**

For those of you who have never been to this subreddit before, someone who knows the celebrity sees the request and tells them about it (more common, but still rare). Third, users themselves contact the celebrity, informing them of /r/IAmA and that there is interest in hearing from them.

This 3rd reason is the reasoning behind the new rule. **From now on, the contact sheet from their website, whatever. Any way that our users can tell this person that we want an AMA from them. Requests that do not comply with this requirement will be deleted. If you cannot find a publicly available way to contact that celebrity, then do not post your request. 

This does **not** apply to requests for non-celebrities (example, or requests for no one in particular (example, ""AMA request: a farmer""). It **only** applies to requests for celebrities. 

This does not change **anything** about Reddit's [rules on posting personal information](http://www.reddit.com/rules):

&gt; **NOT OK**: Posting a link to your friend's facebook profile.

&gt; **OK**: Posting your senator's publicly available contact information

&gt; **NOT OK**: Posting the full name

&gt; **OK**: Posting a link to a public page maintained by a celebrity.

To clear things up

[**Acceptable**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1au1bp/iama_request_jason_bateman/)

[**Unacceptable**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1au1dc/ama_request_jason_bateman/)

2. **Moderation of comments**

[Although the mods have implored our users to act respectfully and courteously](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/184yf5/mod_post_voting_guidelines_and_etiquette/), but also as a place where people will be treated politely and actually listened to. In order to balance those two interests, the moderators **will be removing comments designed solely to harass, abuse, or threaten the OP**. This *absolutely* does not mean that you should not ask tough questions; only that you should do so civilly. From now on, something like ""Fuck you, OP"" will be removed, why did you do [something I disagree with]"" is perfectly fine. Slurs and other hate speech will be specifically targeted. From now on

We hope that both of these rules will bring about plenty of good AMAs from whoever the users want to hear from.

I am sorry for not being able to answer a lot of your questions but the internet in Egypt was blocked for the six past days


I am deeply grateful for all your wishes and kindness in my last thread

I am going to give you a live report on the last few days and hopefully I will answer all your questions along the way.

This started on Tuesday when I went to a protest for a democratic change in Egypt, everywhere, affecting everybody.

I wouldn't consider myself poor, a car and living in a relatively high-class suburb.

I've slept on the street for the first time in my life on Tuesday 25 January, I've seen the true face of Egypt, there were people of all ages, sexes and classes in protests that day, I've seen the poor, the rich, the striving minority, Muslims

Moving on to Wednesday 26 January, in the dawn of the next day.

Thursday was kind of a slow day, to my amazement it jumped to the frontpage, I wasn't expecting near that kind of response but I thank you guys for that, apart from some tear bombs being thrown by the police not much action that day, apart from reddit action of course. Facebook, twitter, Aljazeera, and a couple of other sites were blocked Thursday night.

The big event was on Friday at noon, mobile signal, Messaging services and even some landlines.

I walked nearly 50 Kms that day

I walked from one suburb to the other, it was a huge march but it was only one of tens or hundreds of similar marches in Cairo that day.

Near downtown it was obvious that there was an intense presence of police forces and when we reached the suburb of ""Attaba"" the police forces became unbelievably violent, I was shot a couple of times by rubber bullets but kept on running, I actually thought they were shooting live rounds and judging by my last encounter with them I wouldn't be surprised if they did.

As I said before there wasn't much resentment towards the US in Egypt apart from supporting Mubarak's dictatorship

Soon we learned that not only ""Attaba"" was viciously attacked by the police but everywhere else

Later that day the violence escalated and we were treating the police as our enemies -and they have proven to be so- and Mubarak's arrogant speech got everyone more provoked.

At night we saw the Egyptian heavy artillery roaming the streets

As the army's presence increased the Police were escaping the protestors' violence -which the police initiated and provoked- and after the burning down of most police stations all the criminals escaped -some claim by the police themselves- and Cairo had thousands of thugs and criminals on the streets and a complete absence of police forces, I will leave you guys for a couple of hours I have to go get me some food and when I'm back I will post details about my life after the police vanished from Cairo and answer all your questions.

Edit: Continuing

I must note a couple of random things, I felt scared like I have never felt before in my life, I saw a building collapsing in front of my eyes and my respiratory system now runs on oxygen and tear gas.

Later that day I heard of thugs being released into the streets and I was terrified for my family, I stood in place till dawn and I saw an army vehicle opening fire on one of these armed mobs a couple of blocks away, it was terrifying and some of my neighbors nearly opened fire a couple of times on individual thugs.

Saturday and Sunday were the worst, a couple of armed thugs were arrested downtown and proven to be police officers, which increased the state of hatred we all felt towards them.

I was a ground trooper the next few days, a couple of thugs threw molotov cocktails on our cars and fired a couple of rounds but were arrested and handed to the army.

Till this hour we still have guarding shifts and mine starts in about 5 hours, I feel proud of every Egyptian that took responsibility these couple of days but a couple of questions are still unanswered: Should we let the police take control of the streets again despite their obvious treason to us Egyptians? What can I do to help in punishing those officers responsible for beating me up? 

**Important note:** As I said there were a lot of Christians in the protests

**Flickr:** [Here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/59057377@N07/sets/72157625960891810/) you will find every picture I took, I'll upload what I can. 

**Important edit: Help! Some of my friends just called to let me know they released hundreds of thugs downtown Cairo under the guidance of police officers and intelligence agents with the sole purpose of infiltrating the protests and lots of protesters were killed

1295899831.0,f89jr,Six years ago my wife and I sold everything and bought a 90ft tunnel oven to make cookies. We're now shipping between 1 and 4 thousand pounds per week.  AMA,begreen123,3101,1640,1461,"I'm a business owner and entrepreneur and I haven't worked for someone else since I was 19. I'm doing this AMA so that I can answer any questions you may have about being in business or starting your own company.  The cookie business wasn't my first

My adventures started when I was 6 with my own Fire Department in Cleveland, paper route and hired other kids to deliver for me. By 19 I was eager to ""begin life"" and I dropped out of Bradley University in Peoria. Shortly after that I started my first ""real business"": it was a burglar alarm for apartments. I developed &amp; manufactured the product and sold them by hiring an off-duty detective from the local police force to give “security presentations” in luxury apartment buildings. We would use the party room, he would present statistics, speak about crime and the responsibility of protecting property and I would give a product demonstration and collect orders. A friend would go the next day and install the alarms. This worked out well as I had low overhead &amp; was making a good income.

Some amount of “beginners luck” helped me along the way, I've developed impact recorders, mechanical accelerometers, temperature recorders to monitor the shipment of perishables, and a widely employed derailment detector to stop subway derailments before they become catastrophic. 

Currently I run a business that employs 30-40 people and we produce everything ""in-house"" near Los Angeles. We are selling high quality dog treat &amp; nutritional supplements in about 2, a disposable poop scooper (we produce about 20 million annually) and the best chocolate chip cookies you'll ever eat which I started because I missed the 70's style cookies that made the original Famous Amos a Los Angeles sensation. My cookies are currently being sold in about 200 stores and we're shipping anywhere between 1,000 and 4,000 lbs per week.

Not directly business related but things you may find interesting. I was on “[What’s my Line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What's_My_Line%3F)” and got to hang out with [Soupy Sales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soupy_Sales) for an hour

I've been very impressed with Reddit and the community and this inspired me to do an ""AMA"".  Hope you find it useful.
