I've been fighting tooth and nail with the county parks executive. He doesn't want the course in ""his"" hardwood forest. Even though he doesn't live anywhere near the park and never sets foot out there. 

We (and our course designer) view the forest as wasted space, busy pavillions, etc. Basically a danger zone just begging for injury and a really boring layout. Not something worth spending $10k on. Fund raising is hard in such a small town (we average about $1k / night for a LOT of time investment,) and we're not about to spend all of that money on a lame course that will not be used.

I plan to have a couple more experienced DG'ers demo 2 holes for the county board using two practice baskets

There are a few areas that the Parks Executive has ""issues"" with, there is no valid concern to be had.

A little more info about the course:
Based on the advice from my prior post we turned over the initial design to someone who lives, I focused on playing devil's advocate and working to get the county's permission. We've mapped out lefty holes, righty holes, short technical holes, double tee pad placement to cater to beginners and still have the pro-tees be challenging and technical. Also 2 pin placements for almost every hole. 

The course is cutting through a hard wood forest, but as well as it flows through the natural areas we had to work with... wow. Just wow... We won't have to remove a single mature tree (outside of dead limbs.)

So yea... I'm nervous and can't focus at work today... I sparred with this guy at the last county meeting, staring down 3ish months of work and time spent. 

I'd appreciated some good vibes if you've got 'em to spare...


edit - Wow, then I'm off to the course!!

1363139461.0,1a6sk0,Public Service Announcement: Don't Be That Guy,Allurex,124,10,64,"Hello

I played a PDGA Sanctioned tournament and someone was intentionally playing in a division lower than where they should have been. We were playing on a Par 60 course in rainy conditions, players rated 935+ are required to be playing in the Advanced Division (in Sanctioned Events), but this person was playing Intermediate.

Normally there would be no kind of issue with this, so it's possible that it was his first tournament and simply didn't know which division to play in.

I ended up running into and talking to this guy before the 2nd round, who sometimes plays and does well in the Advanced Division. Instead, he usually plays in Intermediate just so that he can win. He has even avoided joining the PDGA so that he can play in whatever division he wants; because without a PDGA Rating, a member can play in any division.

Some notable quotes from this person-

* ""I didn't drive 3 hours to play in this tournament and get 3rd or 4th in Advanced

* ""Those guys are lucky I didn't decide to play in the Rec division and sweep that""

Along with more similar rantings. The point being

Remember, then by all means stay in Intermediate until you do. What you **shouldn't** do is play in a lower division than you know you really should. If you know you will win Intermediate handily, then you should probably play in Advanced. 

I'm also not saying that you need to join the PDGA so that you have a rating. I know that not everyone wants to be a PDGA Member, just make sure you don't make that decision specifically to avoid having a PDGA Rating. 

Further, make an informed decision about what division you think is best for you. If you aren't sure, ask other players and the Tournament Director for their advice.

To summarize

* **DO** Play Disc Golf Tournaments (Local and Sanctioned both)!
* **DO** Play in a division where you feel comfortable.
* **DO** Join the PDGA if you want to. Membership has many benefits and having a player Rating is just one of them.
* **DON'T** Play in a division lower than the one you know you should be playing in.
* **DON'T** Play in a lower division because you want to win 1st place instead of 3rd/4th or so in the higher division.
* **DON'T** Avoid joining the PDGA just so that you can play in whatever division you want. The PDGA isn't for everyone but that's a bad reason to not join.",self,t5_2qk68,1363199281.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/1a6sk0/public_service_announcement_dont_be_that_guy/

I was talking to some friends while driving home from a wedding in North Carolina this past week and they recommended me trying disc golf (despite none of them actually doing it) as we have a few local courses and were under the impression it is fairly inexpensive. I was looking for some advice or guidance towards an affordable starting kit (assuming such things exist). I snooped around on Amazon for a few hours but really have no idea what is a good or bad deal.

Thank you very much for your time and assistance.

[Link to Vote] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDZrYW1tWkVYOE01cXNNOHl5dm5GR2c6MQ)

[First Update] (http://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/vvu0q/update_official_reddit_disc_golf_disc/)

I am very pleased to announce that Millennium has accepted our offer and will be printing reddit discs for /r/discgolf. Here is the e-mail that I received:

We are just as excited to have these done as you are. This could be a very good thing for the both of us.

For the first stamping, Millennium Quantum and Sirius $15, and $2 for minis (if there is a demand for them).
 
Here is a list of the blank discs and weights we have available for stamping... You can pick up to 4 models to stamp. (You might have the reddit community do a vote on what 4 discs they would want)

Standard Plastic - $10.50

Astra (160-64, 73-75g)
 
JLS (160-64, 73-75g)

Omega Supersoft (150 class, 70-72, 73-75g)
 
Aurora MS (170-177g)
 
Polaris LS (151-59g

Quantum Plastic - $15

Sparkle Astra (160-64, 73-75g)

Orion LF (160-64, 73-75g)
 
Orion LS (160-64, 73-75g)
 
JLS (150 class, 73-75g)

Sparkle Quasar (170-72

Zero-G Quasar (140-50

Zero-G Scorpius (140-50

Sirius Plastic - $15
 
JLS (170-72

Orion LF (150 class, 70-72, 73-75g)
 
Orion LS (160-64, 73-75g)
 
Polaris LS (150 class, 73-75g)

Scorpius (170-72
 
Sentinel MF (165-69g
 
Give me an idea of what discs and weights you guy's would like us to have printed up and we can go from there.
 
Take care
Alex

TL;DR - We are voting on the 4 discs we would like to have stamped. My guess is that they'll do 25 of each. Let the voting begin. 

HOW IT WILL WORK: Please vote for 2 discs. We will discuss weights after we have the discs picked out. I'd like to divide the discussion in half for simplicity sake. 

EDIT: I made the list easier to read.

A lot of you may remember me from my post a few days ago:
http://www.reddit.com/r/discgolf/comments/1i9ot7/overweight_and_tired_of_it_want_to_try_disc_golf/

I hit one of the local courses tonight with a buddy and I have to say that despite the 90 degree temperature and not really knowing what I was doing I had an absolute blast!

It took us about an hour to do the 9 holes that make up that course, my back however was screaming. (which is to be expected)

A few things I noticed this first time out:

-As a right handed thrower

-I am quite out of shape and by the 4th or 5th hole I had to really concentrate hard to keep what little form I had in check (Obviously I had never seen the course so we didn't keep score despite me parring the first hole)

-All of my shots seemed to gain a lot more altitude than I was expecting (probably just me being a noob)

-The 9th hole on that course is an abomination and ate my mid range (although my buddy that threw it agree'd to replace any discs he threw and lost before we went out

Yeah so that's all that I can think of for now. Just wanted to reiterate that I had way more fun than I was expecting and can't wait to get out again!

Thanks for listening

I've noticed a disturbing trend here and on a couple of other disc golf boards that I post on. it feels like a LOT of people expect to be able to walk out on a disc golf course
At the end of the day, but a sport none the less.)

There is NO ""get good fast"" magic formula.
So

1. Disc. the. fuck. down. You don't need a 13 speed driver when you are first starting out. This is a mistake that most people make. Get out there with a teebird or a midrange or a putter and get your form down. Look at the flight chart to see where you need to be throwing. http://gottagogottathrow.com/discgolf/pdf/JoesFlightChart1.pdf 

2. Slow is smooth. Smooth is long. So slow the fuck down.
3. Practice your putting. Now go do it again. And again. OK
4. Go to the field by your house and just practice throwing. Stay off of the course sometimes. Just go practice your form.
5. Watch the Beato videos. Now go watch the climo and felberg videos. now go practice them.
Beato Vid - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nED7gcXobEo . Feldberg Towel Drill (amazing

6. listen to the old guys (they know how to get better. they've seen it all. our course elders helped me with my game more than anyone else could have.)

if you don't give a shit about getting better, I play for fun and to get better. I'll never play Open, or maybe even Am I, but I am always looking to get better. 

Vets
I hope this is beneficial for some of the new cats. I love seeing the sport grow! It's amazing that it's boomed so much in the time that I have been playing. 

Disc on!

1362548043.0,19rd53,The wizardly method of marbling - an easy and artistic way to dye your discs!,,82,13,30,"**[Click here for pictures!](http://imgur.com/a/SwnPh#0)**

**Materials:**

* iDye Poly or RIT Pro (MUST be the Poly version; RIT should work as long as “ND” isn’t on it)

* Shaving cream (foamy and/or gel)

* Clear laundry detergent (or something similar)

* Dinner plate (ceramic

* Stick (paintbrush

* Squeeze bottle (whatever kind)

* Acetone (or non-acetone nail polish remover)

**[Click here for pictures!](http://imgur.com/a/SwnPh#0)** - in case you missed it :)

**Methods:**

1. Mix ~1oz water, and dye in a squeeze bottle.

2. Put foamy

3. Put a small amount of dye (droplets) on top of the shaving cream and make a design.

4. Place a disc onto the shaving cream

5. Leave it alone once it's down. Once ready

**[Click here for pictures!](http://imgur.com/a/SwnPh#0)** - in case you missed it :)

**Tips**

* Acetone will remove the stamp

* All discs don’t dye the same. Not every plastic will take dye perfectly. And you can’t dye a darker color disc with a lighter color dye. Colors of discs and dyes will mix (blue dye on a yellow disc…). Go to DGCR for more info (see links below). See [this thread](http://www.dgcoursereview.com/forums/showthread.php?t=30082) for more info on which plastics take dye.

* You won’t know it without reading the package, but I don't use it. 

* Laundry detergent is for thickness. Clear detergent doesn’t change your dye color.

* I used about 1-2oz of water with a little non-acetone nail polish remover (that’s all I had) I used a cleaned out dish soap squeeze bottle.

* Squirt shaving cream onto the plate and foam it up real nice. Make it even and thick. Don’t allow air pockets.

* Squeeze little bits of dye out at a time on top of the shaving cream. Then swirl around in a pattern you like. Or random. Whatevs. Don’t overdo it.

* Push disc down until the entire flight plate is covered. Be mindful of the fact that the dye nearest to the edge of the flight plate will push out and kind of smear the dye pattern. You could probably form your shaving cream to have a bit of a concave section to avoid this if you’re crafty like that. I don’t really care.

* Leave it alone as long as you want. See my ‘Cloud Storm’ - it was lifted after 5 hours. Tentacular was 24 hours.

* If you don’t like your first dye, mix, or change colors (you cannot lighten colors as far as I know)

Dan Howard created this shaving cream marbling technique.

I just want to throw those two names out there anyway. These dudes are the pioneers of radical dyeing as I know it. Disc Golf Course Review has an entire subforum devoted to disc dyeing. [Check it out here.](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dgcoursereview.com%2Fforums%2Fforumdisplay.php%3Ff%3D25&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHbo8yU7kLyIQFW_ct6rZU67V3xxQ) The subforums and mainly the members of DGCR are invaluable and awesome. Super friendly! If you pay a little bit you get access to the VIP Lounge that has VIP dyeing tips and you can sell/trade discs in the Marketplace

**[Click here for pictures!](http://imgur.com/a/SwnPh#0)** - in case you missed it :)

**Background:**

I didn’t want to spend all the time necessary to cut out a cool design and deal with dyeing discs the traditional dip dye way because I don’t have anything I want to dye onto a disc. For reference, and dye your disc in dye that has been heated to like 100 degrees or so.

I love the artistic dyes. The spin painting is my favorite

     I live in Portland, as well as perfect for a few long bomb/safari holes on the quiet ones..
     So now to the point.  This course, and smack dab in the middle of a relatively posh neighborhood.  The neighbors are not stuck up rich people (as I might have thought), most of them are very nice and curious about this sport that has taken over their park.  I have had the last two days off work,and spent them both there,  so I have had a chance to meet quite a few of them...Including their disc golfer children.  These boys (thankfully) warned me before I made a crucial mistake.  They informed me that the neighborhood watch will not hesitate to call the police on any illicit behavior seen going on in that park, AT ANY TIME, children present or not.  
     I spread this warning to all of my fellow ent-aholic, we do a dis-service to the sport of disc golf and maintain the negative stereotype that I often encounter when I tell people I play with frisbees by myself in the park.
     It is easy to understand where the stereotype comes from and all I am asking is the we all take an effort in the coming summer, not just out of respect for the neighbors but your fellow golfers, keep an old altoids tin on hand for cig butts and pack out your trash.  If you indulge in illicit behavior, be aware that others may not share or respect your life choices, in other words...""If you come between a mother bear and her cub, you're gonna have a bad time"". And as far as noise goes, I have no idea how loud (or long) I will scream and cry (like a little girl) when I hit my first ace
     Disc Golf is a great sport for all ages and walks of life, and the same can be said for the course you cherish.  I contributed nothing, but have grown an immediate fondness for it.  The least I can do is respect the neighborhood and those kind enough to share it with me, all I ask is that you to do the same.
     That is my soapbox, and discs.
Happy throwing!

My only exception? If you OWN the basket or you are playing on a private course where the owner let's you write on it.

As noted, convey's a tainted image to non-players, it takes time/money/maintenance to clean up, and all the people who worked hard to get the baskets installed don't want you writing on them.  We all love great baskets and we all love Aces... let's not muddle the two.

For me

We originally called it ""Double Disc"" ... but it was quickly renamed ""Devil's Disc"" because oh my god - it will piss you off. But its helped.

The rules are simple - Throw two discs on every throw

Two drives, but only 1 bad and you've got bogey or worse. 

Things its done for me:

- I've slowed down. Every shot is much more important if I am going to score well.

- I play for par and take the safest shot possible every time. 

- it has COMPLETELY removed good luck from my game

- I have new scores to beat on the same courses I have been playing this whole time

- Its helped me learn to throw more than one mold on every shot (I don't have 2 of any mold in my bag).

Give it a shot! It does suck when you park your first drive for what would be an easy bird, and your 2nd putt rolls away and you're left with a 5 or 6 on your card... and your first shot set you up for an easy 2... but having to deal with those situations more often has helped me learn to play smarter, take fewer throw it and hope shots, and take the bad stuff in stride.

Apologies for spelling/grammar.. typed this on my phone during my lunch break.

(please add or edit for a cool document for n00bs!)

These are localized rules of Northern Santa Barbara Disc Golf.  I also find it an interesting cultural exercise to see what unwritten rules exist in other locales.  So bring it!

1)  Clean the course as you play and never litter.  Our club is buying new trash cans and drinking fountains for the whole park and they will be labeled as gifts from the DG'ers.

2)  Never vandalize or abuse the chains, etc.)

3)  Keep park patrons happy.  Don't throw into them or cajole them.  Be gentle until they've been in your line for longer than a minute after noticing you

4)  Euro attitude towards intoxicants:  all about low profile and attitude.  If you're tripping balls on 1000 mics of liquid LSD, invisible, and recycle all my empties!

5) Keep your park safe.  Our club talked so much shit to a local suspected child molester who parked for hours a day

6)  Always hand putters back to their owners when clearing your own disc from the basket.  Ask before picking up a disc not resting in the basket.

7)  Call every single number you find on a lost disc.  If you don't

8)  Help your bros and sistahs find their discs when they are lost.  It looks really douchey when three people are looking for a disc and you're practicing your mid range game.

9)  Encourage your female friends to pick up the game.  Remind them that disc golf is like  a convertible Ferrari:  any woman looks twice as hot in context.

10)  Play ready disc golf (except for tourneys)

11)  Pay attention to where others in your group are

12)  A putt that rolls back to your feet gets a redo

13)  A rolling hillside Death Putt should be kicked and stopped if it rolls at another player in non-tourney play.  I make sure I kick it no nearer than 20'

14)  If a player can retrieve a disc from a tree without climbing or using a tool

15)  Wave faster groups through and wave them up when everyone is clear.

16)  Mob play (groups of 6+) only make sense if the park is pretty empty.  Let folks play through always!

17)  Encourage young people and newbs to greatness and offer to play with them to teach them some throws.  I keep old

First I must say

The biggest change is the creation of several niche discgolf subs

Also, the creation of a FAQ will ease the burden on users who consistently spend their time answering the same questions, or digging up old posts, while also providing a better centralized repository of common knowledge for the community. The FAQ page contains definitions, techniques, and advice, as well as links to posts, and other reference materials.

We are also introducing a variety of CSS related tweaks. The most important is the top subreddit bar which provides the same links within all of our community subs for easy navigation. (The FAQ will be moved to the official FAQ page soon.) We can also employ sidebar pics, as we are looking for more feedback from all of you.

I really want to say thank you again to all the hard working members of our community that have helped discuss and develop the changes you see -- I couldn't have done it myself, he has kept me up to date with the community when I am too busy to do so (while out discing of course!), and his constant efforts deserve the recognition.

In closing

I had a conversation with /u/spoonraker on a thread here the other day about the importance of pivoting on the heel of the front foot rather than the ball

This conversation was in the back of my mind today when I saw Robinson Cano of the Yankees hit a homerun in a game against the Tampa Bay Rays. The broadcasters commented on his smooth weight transfer, and took some screencaps.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/LkZCw#0) is the slideshow from the beginning. The most important one though is [here](http://imgur.com/a/LkZCw#2), it's pretty clear that he is pivoting on the outside of his heel. His [finish](http://imgur.com/a/LkZCw#4) is actually fairly balanced front to back.

For me, and I'd guess that it would be difficult to get full power behind your throw if you do the same throwing a disc. 

Of course
