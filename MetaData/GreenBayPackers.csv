1367009783.0,1d6f2f,Aaron Rodgers is the Greatest QB in the League and Big Ben is vastly inferior,VCOMAC,211,36,52,"This should be patently obvious to even the untrained eye

For starters, and he still played every game. He was sacked over 20 times more than Ben and Rodgers just did not give a single fuck. That is why he is a great quarter back.

And I havent even talked about his passing. Although to be fair what is there to say that hasnt already been said. The list of NFL records on his wikipedia page more than speaks for itself

Single season QB Passer Rating record (122.5)

Highest career passer rating in regular season with a minimum of 1

Most games with a passer rating of over 110.0 (12) and 100.0 (13) in a season.

Most consecutive games with a passer rating of over 100.0 (12) and 110.0 (11)

Highest career completion percentage in regular season (65.7%)

Most passing yards by a quarterback in their first playoff game (423)

Only quarterback in history post over 400 yards passing

Best touchdown to interception ratio in NFL history.

Tied NFL record for most consecutive games with at least two touchdown passes (13).

Tied NFL record for most consecutive playoff games with at least 3 touchdown passes (3).

I think that the highest touchdown to interception rating thing is perhaps the best indicator of how amazing a player Rodgers is. On the other hand Big Ben's records? All about how he was really young when he won big. He was the youngest qb to ever reach x wins, instead of just a decent QB surrounded by amazing talent.

I could go on, and at only 29 could very feasibly have another good 8-12 years of play in him. Ben Roethlisberger is a decent QB who is nearing the end of his career.",,False,self,t5_2qqd2,False,,

I posted a stat about Cobb's rushing last week and am looking to make this a weekly post on this sub if there is interest.

Back to number 29. Our 2nd round pick rookie was on the field for all 75 defensive snaps and was thrown at 7 times which was the most of any Packer defender. The defense was on for a significant portion of the game with GB only having 65 offensive snaps.

He got his hands on 4 of these balls, this upcoming defender is definitely a playmaker.

Hayward only allowed a single completion all game to Tony Scheffler for 6 yards. 6 total yards over 75 snaps against the offense putting up the most yards/game average in the NFL (307). Let that sink in.

Titus Young and Megatron were both made non factors whenever Casey was involved in the coverage. When you can hold one of the best skill position players in the NFL to zero yards in a game while in your rookie year then you've clearly got something going.

Now on his 5th interception in 11 games

Opposing QBs now have an average of 28.5 passer rating when throwing at Hayward, he does his job and significantly more.

Not a Packer fan worried about their team's fate.
Lombardis were stored in their cases with care
In hopes that St. Rodgers would put one more there. 

The Bears were all nestled in Appleton's beds
While delusions of victory danced in their heads.
My folks wearing cheeseheads
Knew Sunday would bring us all one more win near. 

And on Lambeau Field
Soon seats would be shimmering with gold and with green.
With gates open wide
With plump tasty bratwurst
The Packers would win in the rain,
For now the moon shone on calm tundra below. 

From the couch I awoke
Calling Tebow a miracle
A hyped-up QB
We all know the real thing's our dear St. A-Rod. 

We bask in his glory and fill up the stands
To watch coach McCarthy give sterling commands:
""On Driver, on Woodson,
On Jennings, and Clifton!
Throwing and running
Swift interceptions

And then,
Mumbling and grumbling with lies from the mouth:
""Your 13 and 1 season is one big fluke
Your green and gold's ugly

But we must feel sorry for the whole Windy City
We'd be steamed too
They watch once again as their Bears take a dive
Left forever living in 1985. 

""U mad bro?"" I shouted
""Perhaps you'd pass one more time to our guy Raji?""
""You know,
That shook when he danced like a bowl full of jelly?"" 

But St. Rodgers swooped in like Tramon on a pick
""Never mind him
""Tomorrow with family
Bears thrown to the curb

""The Niners, and the 'Boys?
Soon broken and trashed like cheap children's toys.
God's on Tebow's side? That argument's weak
Five words: Ice Bowl

As gameday drew near
To give touchdown gifts
He exclaimed
""Merry Christmas to all! The Bears still suck!""

When a team has a season like the Packers last year, the Packers did nothing to stop teams from adapting to them.

Look at the Patriots.  One year they shred everyone by throwing non-stop cut option routes to welker.  Next year

The Packers didn't do that.  Now teams worked on dropping 6-7 skilled DB's and then pass rush the QB and Rodgers no longer has his wide open WR's 15-30 yards downfield every play nor does he have any time to try to throw them open.  But they are still trying to do that same thing that they were doing last year.

First play, Finley in motion and settles in the backfield, where Lacy waits.  Rodgers fakes the hand-off, Lacy picks up a block, Rodgers lobs the ball to a sprinting Jordy Nelson.  Touchdown on the very first play, on a play-action pass, catching the safety on the fake.

Two days before the game expectations are met and the Metrodome collapses for no reason whatsoever.  The NFL scrambles  to find a replacement venue and settles on Lambeau.  Frazier asks Pfeterson

The day of the game most of the Vikings players are sick.  Their wives cooked them a big traditional Minnesota dinner.  Since Minnesota cuisine is so awful the players resorted to licking each other’s buttholes to get the taste out of their mouths.  As a result they contacted minor cases of e coli.  Some of the o-line can’t even play because they licked more butthole than most and got sicker than most.

Throughout the game the Packers repeatedly hold the Vikings to field goals.  But like water was turned into wine, Clay crushes the defender and his helmet comes off.  No matter.  He whips his hair around Ponder and cuts him in half like Kabuki Quantum Fighter.

“Can you heal him?” Frazier asks Peterson.  “Do you really want to waste a miracle on Christian fucking Ponder?”  Until this time

Some how some way the Vikings hold off the Packers.  Two minutes are left in the 4th, Kuhn’s lead blocker is stunned for a moment.  Kuhn runs into Raji and almost butt fumbles.  Almost.  Gaining a head of steam Raji crashes through the hole just as Allen appears.  Raji hits Allen so hard he knocks the inbred redneck out of him.  Kuhn scores with :28 left in the game.  “Even Crosby can make this kick and send us into overtime McCarthy thinks.”  Crosby can’t.  Packers are down by 1 and kick off.

With less than half a minute remaining, anything.  “Just throw it  away!  Take a tackle!  Anything!” Frazier screams.  Cassel elects for anything.  As he zigs and zags he slowly backs to the endzone.  Cassel makes it to his own endzone, trips and Clay lands on him.  Packers win by 1.

Fans and Packers storm the field in glee.  They hoist Clay

then Aaron Rodgers should absolutely should get the award.  Rodgers does so much for his team and has outplayed Manning this year.  

Rodgers: 39 TD, 108 QB rating
Manning: 37 TD, 105.8 QB rating

Add on a less effective defense and inferior offensive line: it becomes clear that Rodgers has bested Manning this year in terms of statistics and provides just as much (if not more) value than ol' number 18.  

I think that people are all over Manning because he has made such a large comeback from serious neck injury.  This doesn't make him the MVP though; it only merits Comeback Player of the Year.  Manning joined a team that made it to the divisional round of the playoffs last year WITHOUT him!
