Last weekend I threw together a little GUI  utility to make the process of running games in a separate X server really easy. I wrote it very quickly and it probably has lots of bugs

**Screenshots

Make sure you follow the installation instructions: there are a few terminal commands to run!

Lemme know if it breaks for certain games

Benefits of running a game this way:

* No matter what the game is

* It may run faster

* If the game crashes the X server for some reason it won't take out your other applications

* Even games that allow switching back to other applications sometimes mess up when you restore their size

Future plans: I have a few more ideas floating in my head to use this system to make multiple monitor gaming *just work* on Linux, etc, and use Ctrl+Alt+F7 and Ctrl+Alt+F8 to switch between the game and your desktop, as with the single monitor (I think that would work, right?). Thoughts?

Note: I was learning `quickly` and Gtk in the process

I started looking at the launcher script and the Steam directory layout and ran into some really poorly done things. If anyone knows how to forward these points to the Steam devs at Valve, I'll just list some examples below to show you why I consider this to be done poorly.

* **Steam messes with files which are supposed to be handled by the package manager:**  
  The Steam launcher script (*~/Steam/steam.sh*) runs the following code:

    sh ""$UPDATESCRIPT"" &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 || gksudo --disable-grab --message $""Enter your password to update $STEAMSCRIPT"" sh ""$UPDATESCRIPT""

  This means, create a copy of this file in */usr/local/bin* (which is usually prefixed to */usr/bin/* in *$PATH*) and modify this one. Everything else is just really bad.  
  If it would be really properly done

* **The launcher is missing fundamental error checking**  
  A shell script which is ran out of CLI context should always deal with possible errors in a way which makes it possible for non-technical users to see what's the problem when something goes wrong. 
  Right now

    sh ""$UPDATESCRIPT"" &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 || gksudo --disable-grab --message $""Enter your password to update $STEAMSCRIPT"" sh ""$UPDATESCRIPT""

  But before running this code, even when this line couldn't be ran at all. The other bad things happening in this line of code have been described in the previous point. Furthermore, this line should be changed to be a little more cross-desktop friendly, use *kdesu*/*kdesudo* on KDE environments etc.

* **The launcher script is using the not quite most elegant bash-code**  
  There are some rather clumsy things done in the launcher script:
  * Instead of using bash builtin parameter substitution
    **current code:** *PLATFORM32=\`echo $PLATFORM | sed 's/64/32/'\`*  
    **improved code:** *PLATFORM32=""${PLATFORM/64/32}""*  
  * Improper use of tools. Instead of using the *-q* argument of *grep*
    **current code:** *egrep '\^[Uu]niverse *= *[Bb]eta$' ""$STEAMROOT/Steam.cfg"" &gt;/dev/null; then*  
    **improved code:** *grep -qi -e '\^universe *= *beta$' ""${STEAMROOT}/Steam.cfg""; then*  
  * It uses deprecated tools

&gt;Direct invocation as either egrep or fgrep is deprecated



I could continue this list forever focussing on the launcher script alone and there are 10 times more bad things on the whole application. So if anyone knows how to forward this to the Steam devs at Valve

**Note regarding Games awaiting Greenlight approval**

Also see [Steam Greenlight](http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=765) - last time I checked there were 200+ games that were hoping to get Greenlit that stated that they'd be supporting Linux.  There's ones that have clearly done little development and others that just look awful, [Legend of Aethereus](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=92957124), [Monster Minis Extreme Off-Road](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=93025511) etc etc).  Obviously, you can support those games that seem good by voting them up on greenlight (note: it is possible to filter for just games with linux versions stated)

...

**Awaiting responses from developers**

Air Forte, Bullet Candy (Perfect), Eufloria, Fieldrunners, Jamestown, Legend of Grimrock, Limbo, Torchlight

...

**Existing or greenlit games where the news ain't so good** - [**Super Meat Boy**](http://steamcommunity.com/app/40800/discussions/0/864951475490355056/), **Wizorb** (""we have no plan to release Wizorb on Steam"" via email), Amanita-design games (**Machinarium**, **Samorost**, **Botanicula**) - (""well, we do think about it but right now we are too busy. I am sorry."",via email), but it would require a bit of work on our end and we-'re swamped with Avadon 2""

...

&gt; A separation of subreddits would make it easier for both parts.

&gt; - People who need support can navigate to a single subreddit (etc. /r/steamforlinux) and find a bunch of (helpful) submissions.

&gt; - People who are only interested in gaming itself on Linux

**CONS**

&gt; I'm not in the beta yet

- [beatool](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/13khmh/meta_post_rlinux_gaming_is_not_for_steam_bugcrash/c74rtwd)

&gt;  I'd rather come to /r/linux_gaming for everything related to gaming on linux than have to jump around 5 different subreddits depending on what I want to see/ask on what is essentially the topic of gaming on linux.

We are a small indie game development studio called Anchora Games. Earlier this year we released our first game Forgotten Myths which is a free to play online trading card game.

A couple of weeks ago we received an email from one of our users regarding platform availability. In order to play Forgotten Myths CCG, and we released Forgotten Myths on Linux a few days back.

Today we submitted Forgotten Myths CCG to Steam Greenlight for two of reasons: Users will be able to receive game updates much more conveniently and the game can get more attention in a digital distribution platform available in PC

* CPU: *Intel i5 2500k (3.3ghz)*
* GFX: *EVGA GTX 580*
* HD: *OCZ Vertex 2 SSD*
* MB: *MSI P67A-GD55*
* RAM: *8GB DDR3*
* Windows: *Windows 8 Pro (64 Bit) fully updated. (NVIDIA 306.97)*
* Linux: *Ubuntu 12.04 (32 bit

**Information**

I attempted to do these benchmarks on 12.10 (64 bit) but ran in to problems with it
I also set the performance modes in nvidia-settings and the nvidia control panel from ""Adaptive"" to ""Full Performance"" as well as disabling vertical sync on both systems. All of the benchmarks were done as fairly as possible. This Windows 8 install is no more than 3 days old and the Ubuntu install is fresh. All processes or programs that load on boot
other than what is installed by each operating system by default were disabled.

I allowed each instance of Steam/TF2 an initial load before going in to the benchmarks and used the timedemo feature to benchmark the in-game FPS. This was on my community server running cp_dustbowl and it was 10vs10. I captured about a minute of game footage from first person perspectives as well as free look

I ran 3 rounds for every different benchmark I did also. For the start up benchmarks I allowed the game to load one time before starting the 3 actual tests. I began the stopwatch when the screen turned black after clicking ""Play"" and stopped the watch when the menu items loaded.

For screenshots of the settings I used for low/high click use these links: [low](http://i.imgur.com/AIujC.jpg?1) &amp; [high](http://i.imgur.com/aQemd.jpg?1).

For a video of a short MGE round I played click this link: [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJruzlYuWo0)

Ignore the FPS in that video. I used the startmovie feature of TF2 to export the demo to individual frames and then later compiled them in to a video. The actual FPS I get on that map and arena is between 800 - 1000 FPS.

I then ran a test to time from when I joined a server (connect &lt;ip address&gt;) in console to when the select a team screen loaded. I gave this an initial connection too

If you have already installed TF2 you just have to launch it and it will convert the existing installation and download some additional files.

Once you launch TF2 for the first time after converting

I have a GTX 660

I'm not running it on an SSD

Now, and this time ""set launch options"".

Type ""-novid"" without quotes and press OK. Then exit out of properties.

If you want to install mods or cfg files such as autoexec.cfg I found this guide

It's pretty much the same for TF2 but instead of the 'dod' folder it would be 'tf'.

I mean I was fine with playing TF2 in wine, nothing happened in the world of Linux gaming. Sure Wine kept getting better

Then the arrival of Steam happened. Once again I felt like I was having a surreal experience. I didn't have to run Steam in wine but rather I could run it natively, a few years ago Killing Floor came out and I played that so much before Vista crapped out. It was my favorite game at the time alongside TF2, and nowadays I can play it on my Linux laptop natively just as I would on the PC version.

Both systems have their pros and cons

**STEAM**

*Pros*

* Large gaming library that *might* be migrated to Linux OSes
* Lots of Triple A titles who might get ported
* Huge community and support
* Steam Sales
* Many of their games have achievements.
* Larger userbase
* Steam updater updates only the files that need to be updated.

*Cons*

* DRM
* Sluggish at times
* Lacking Linux games (some games that have been ported to linux are not showing up as SteamPlay
* Their mutliplayer feature locks out those who might have got the game elsewhere.
* You don't own the game

**Desura**

*Pros*

* Not inherently DRM (many games can even be downloaded without the client
* Open source client *Desurium*
* Lots of Linux games!
* Alpha-funding. It's like Greenlight on Steam only easier to get in.

*Cons*

* Getting some of those games take more advanced knowledge (*chmod +x game*)
* Not nearly as many Triple A titles
* Community is not as prevalent
*  Installing/updating multiple games simultaneously is likely to crash the Desura client.
* Updater downloads the whole package.

Now this is a list that I started off the top of my hat to start the conversation

Edit: Think about this scenario...

A game you really want is on sale on both platforms

Edit 2: More consideration from /u/sakuramboo. Added to above list

Edit 3: /u/gamedeveloper makes a good point. Added to Con for Desura

Edit 4: Forgot the biggest Steam Con. You don't own the game

Edit 5: Some of you mention buying it from the developers. I think this is a great idea and I wish I would have put it in the title. So

It seems the explanation I gave above was quite poor.  I apologize

What this does is (ab)use chroots, if a particular program is problematic in the distro of your choice, but you know it works in another distro, you just set it to use that distro and it will just work.

For example, I just picked a distro I knew QL worked in and ran it and it worked.  Transparently.

I primarily intended this for things which are not necessarily game specific.  For example:

1358708879.0,16xwro,[DESURA] Looking for developers (x-post from r/gamedevclassifieds),NothingMuchHereToSay,73,8,4,"Hi

To clarify anything first

Desurium is the community developed open source continuation of the previously closed source Desura client [Desura](http://www.desura.com/).

I discovered this client a couple of years ago and have noticed that the development for Desurium is currently lackluster and we need more developers.

Currently, Mac, and Linux. Unfortunately, the latest Desura client is only currently available for Windows and Linux.

The in-development Desurium client outperforms the older Desura client on Linux. However it is only available to be compiled on Linux. The Windows version of Desurium is currently incomplete and needs more tinkering with.

A Mac client is on the roadmap

Windows and Mac developers are strongly encouraged to contribute to this project (additional Linux developers are always welcome too!) Desurium is licensed under the GPLv3

I'm here to recruit anybody who is interested in contributing to the development of Desura/Desurium

1338830971.0,ukhmv,The Humble Bundle V help thread,hirnbrot,62,5,60,"I thought we'd consolidate every piece of HIBV info we have into one thread.


My system:

archlinux 64-bit with pure alsa (no pulseaudio)

GeForce GT 540M (optimus) and intel HD3000

What I have found out so far:

In general dependencies seem rather light on these

- Bastion runs flawless on my system (with intel or nvidia graphics). There is also an update available (since 2012-06-02)

- Limbo doesn't run in the ""linux"" version

- Psychonauts is really crashy

- S&amp;S works without problems. `ldd` shows no particularly obscure dependencies

- I haven't tried amnesia yet (too scared)

Fixes:

#Bastion:

Download the updated version.

#Bastion crashes on input (moving mouse): 

&gt;The solution is to add this line &lt;dllmap os=""linux"" dll=""libXi"" target=""libXi.so.6""/&gt; to file 'OpenTK.dll.config'.

#Bastion resolutions:

Minimum resolution is 1024x768

#Limbo:

Try the windows version with wine.

**07.06**: New ""linux version"" is out and this one actually _works_ with my intel card. Launching it with bumblebee still fails due to ""Missing Shader Model 3.0 Support"" or something equally silly.

#Limbo has no sound:

Install the 32-bit version of libpulse (lib32-libpulse in arch and libpulse0:i386 in ubuntu).

#Psychonauts:

Wait for icculus to get his ass in gear :-).

Watch the bugzilla at https://bugzilla.icculus.org/buglist.cgi?product=Psychonauts and try the patch at https://bugzilla.icculus.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5533#c2

**EDIT**: New  Psychonauts build is out on the humble store. Not sure if it is just the patch already posted (which doesn't fix everything) or something new. 

------

**07.06**: They just added Braid

Super Meat Boy is a brand new build (icculus did say he wanted to finish it sometime)

I'm downloading them right now and will add info.

Lonesurvivor is distributed as a tarfile

It is a 32-bit build even on 64-bit systems

It runs in flash player which I can't figure out how to get to fullscreen mode. For a horror game like lone survivor this is _bad_.

Lackluster ""port"".

Braid is an Icculus port

It ships most of its libraries (SDL etc) as usual.

It seems to work well (to be expected given it had some time to mature) but right now I'm looking to set the language to english (I hate to play games in german since the translation is usually bad).

Supermeatboy seems to run and install okay

One thing I did notice though is that the replay can sometimes be out of sync with the world (so it appears as if meatboy is walking through razorblades),False,,t5_2r2u0,1339090647.0,,archlinux,t3_ukhmv

I'm Ourson, [WAKFU](http://www.wakfu.com/en/mmorpg/game/presentation) , Fly'n or the epic animated serie also called Wakfu. 


We just released Wakfu on the Ubuntu software center


But


I do not have time to provide a native package for every single distro. 
But, you are awesome and, you are welcome to do it !


I've setup a [public mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ankama-linux-support) so you can follow and participate in the packaging efforts as a community.


Wakfu has always been somehow available on linux
Hopefully


So please
That whole move to publish WAKFU on ubuntu is kinda a personal initiative. 
I really think the winds are shifting and
 

What could we do to improve the experience ? What other of our games would you like to see on linux ?  If you do happen to be on Ubuntu


Finally

And thanks to the Ubuntu ""MyApps"" team for making that possible.

I know it's been a while since Brutal Doom first gained widespread attention
For those of you unacquainted with Brutal Doom
  
**Step 1: Install GZDoom**  
For those of us on Debian based distros (Ubuntu
    $ sudo apt-add-repository 'deb http://debian.drdteam.org/ stable multiverse'  
[Then download and import this gpg key] (http://debian.drdteam.org/drdteam.gpg)  
    $ sudo apt-get update  
    $ sudo apt-get install gzdoom  
Done. [Everyone else gets to deal with this mess](http://zdoom.org/wiki/Compile_ZDoom_on_Linux)  

**Step 2: Acquire .wad files**  
Which you of course have from owning Doom/Doom2/Doom Final and did not acquire through the reprehensible method of googling things like 'Doom1.wad', or 'tnt.wad'.
 
Rename all of these files *including their .wad extensions* to be entirely lowercase. Remember
  
**Step 3: Acquire Brutal Doom**  
Brutal Doom: http://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom/downloads/brutal-doom-version-181  
Alternate Soundtrack (highly reccomended): http://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom/downloads/doom-metal-soundtrack-mod-volume-3  
Go ahead and extract these.  
  
**Step 4: Assemble and Configure**  
Now take all those .wad and .pk3 files and dump them in your gzdoom folder (/usr/games/gzdoom). If you're one of those folks who hates mucking about outside of your home folder and doesn't care about other users playing this on your system
Now you need to direct gzdoom to autoload these, so my zdoom.ini looks more like this: http://pastie.org/6232801  
You'll note that besides things like Path=/usr/games/gzdoom/brutalv018a.pk3 I've got some paths about lights and brightmaps. [Explanation.](http://zdoom.org/wiki/GZDoom#Dynamic_lights_and_brightmaps)  

I appreciate your attention and ask for corrections/ways I can improve this. Have fun

Bart K. here, and we've built up fine community and a good reputation.  We frequently do paid commissions of art and music for specific open source game projects, but thus far we've been unable to fund the creation of 3D art because it's so specific and expensive.

To be specific

To give you an idea of what art costs

September was a fairly typical month.  We spent a total of $688 ($488 on commissions, which meant that *the $520 balance came out of my own pocket*.  I am not, for the record, particularly rich; I'm just an average software engineer with a wonderful and supportive wife. :)

We recently received a big sponsorship from [Gameboom](http://gameboom.com) (thanks guys!)

All that being said, which means that we're less able to provide help to a lot of very deserving FOSS game projects.  We could afford maybe one 3D commission a month (if we get a good deal on it), but that would pretty much lock us out of sponsoring any other projects.

So

Interested in helping?  Just click the Donate button on our [homepage](http://opengameart.org).  If you want to donate but hate PayPal

Remember, forever!

Peace
Bart K.
http://opengameart.org

P.S.  I will continue to put a lot of money toward commissions myself

P.P.S.  Can't donate at the moment?  An upvote would be appreciated. ;)",,t5_2r2u0,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/dwtei/opengameartorg_needs_your_help_so_that_we_can/

The only down side is the clicking the game once launches steam in offline mode. You are free to leave that version of steam running and any other games in the same bottle that require steam will launch on the first click. The only thing that bugs me is that I can't get rid of the duplicate offline steam icon in the system tray.

Bonus - You can also use steam grid icons to make the games look all nice in grid mode. Just right click the game in grid mode and click on ""Set Custom Image""

1347245367.0,zmtyr,My experience so far switching to Linux,,53,7,39,"I'm running Mint 13 Cinnamon.

**Background:**

A little background - I'm not the average computer user that wants to try Linux out

**Setup:**

i5 750, they wouldn't install properly, and even after a manual install performance in games was poor (ESPECIALLY in Wine) so I put my old GTX 460's back in (SLI). SLI proved to be pretty poor performance for Wine games, better for native games, but I play a couple Wine games a lot (SC2 and LoL) so I ended up disabling SLI.

**Performance:**

With the single GTX 460 1GB

I'm thinking of selling both my GTX 460's and the 6950

**Game availability:**

I have bought a few humble indie bundies

So far PlayOnLinux/Wine have been great. I haven't run into a game that I want to play that won't run yet.

**Work:**

As I said I'm a systems architect/admin

So far I REALLY REALLY prefer Linux for this. The workspaces alone - oh man. I have three monitors

I'm already familiar with the command line

**Everything else:**

Booting up is faster (main partition on a SSD

Tunneling into work is great. I VPN in

**Problems:**

ATi drivers were a nightmare. =/ I'd rather be running my more powerful 6950

Steam is a bit of a pain to configure - so far the few games I want to play have separate Steam logins through PlayOnLinux

* * * * * * * 

Not the greatest writeup, and I can do everything I want to on Linux.

We are 5k ppl in here :) having a central reddit server to join to play and instructions on how to get the game would be nice... also some kind of way to submit games suggestions and vote for next month game of the month... something like vote for next map kind of thing :)

i suggest a month so its enough time to install it/learn how to play/spread the word/etc...

I'm the dev behind a 3D space game called Salvation Prophecy.  I've been getting my linux groove on

Salvation Prophecy a military space epic.  It is single player.  It combines space sim battles, take part in big space battles, and land on planets too.  You work your way up in ranks by completing missions until you command your entire faction's battle strategy.  It's set against the backdrop of a futuristic war between humans, mutants, and robotic races battling for galactic domination, with an interstellar species of hostile aliens peering out of the murky depths of space.

Then we put a copy of DUKE3D.GRP that we got from buying it not googling it into our ~/.eduke32/ folder.  
Then we extract the contents of the moddb download into our ~/.eduke32/ folder.

Long story short - I couldn't make Brutal Legend or Shank to recognize any of my gamepads.
Today I found out that xboxdrv can work on top of ANY joystick/gamepad using evdev.
So with this simple mapping I have xboxdrv create another gamepad which mimics xbox360 controller using xpad driver and works out-of-the-box in both Shank and Brutal Legend (and should with others too):

&gt;xboxdrv --evdev /dev/input/event15 --evdev-absmap ABS_X=x1,ABS_Z=y2,ABS_HAT0X=dpad_x,ABS_HAT0Y=dpad_y --axismap -Y1=Y1,-Y2=Y2 --evdev-keymap BTN_TOP=x,BTN_TRIGGER=y,BTN_THUMB2=a,BTN_BASE3=back,BTN_TOP2=lt

/dev/input/event15 should point to correct event device of your gamepad. This is the mapping for PS2 controller adapter. You can adjust it by removing --silent and adding --evdev-debug to output evdev codes for pressed buttons/axes

I also managed to fully simulate xbox360 controller for wine games but thats out of scope of this subbreddit.

You can also setup mapping for SDL2 gamepad API using Steam Big Picture mode. That'll work for Steam games only though (those using SDL2 library).

1. Download the linux Desura client from [desura.com](http://desura.com/) and install it. If you're using Arch Linux you can install it [from the AUR](http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=52511).

2. Start it up

3. Click the little blue Desura logo at the top left

4. Type the following commands:

    ""gc_linux_disable_windows_warning true""

    ""gc_beta 1""

5. Now we get to adding games. I'll use Minecraft as an example here. You're going to need to create a quick shell script to execute your game. (A lot of Linux games already come with one

6. Type this in the file and save it:

    \#!/bin/sh

    java -jar ~/.minecraft/bin/minecraft.jar

7. Get into a terminal and use chmod to make your new script executable:

    sudo chmod a+x ~/.minecraft/minecraft.sh

8. Get back to the Desura console. Type in this command:

    gc_link_add [NAME OF GAME] [PATH TO .SH FILE] none

    So for our Minecraft example we would do:

    gc_link_add Minecraft /home/[USERNAME]/.minecraft/minecraft.sh none

9. Select your game from your Desura games list and start playing! You may have some trouble starting Desura after you quit the game. If this happens

Hope this helped for those of us who want to get an early head start.",,t5_2r2u0,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/kqth6/howto_use_the_desura_beta_client_to_addmanageplay/

It's a script that extracts the video file from a twitch or ustream page and passes it on to a video player of your choice (mplayer by default). That way streaming a 720p video will only take 5% CPU load instead of 50%.

* [Arch](http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bumblebee)
* [Debian](http://wiki.debian.org/Bumblebee)
* [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Bumblebee)
* [Ubuntu](http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee)

**II. Make Steam Use The Correct GPU**


If you are using Optimus, and every game you execute in Steam will follow suit.  There are two ways to make this work.  Neither solution is difficult, but one is much less efficient.

&amp;nbsp;

**A.** The Proper Solution.

This solution is the best and it's supported by Valve.  Do yourself a favor and do it this way.

Step 1. Open Steam

Step 2. Open your Steam Library

Step 3. Right click on the game that requires your Nvidia GPU

Step 4. Click Properties

Step 5. Click the General tab

Step 6. Click SET LAUNCH OPTIONS...

Step 7. Insert the following text and click OK:

    optirun --bridge primus %command%

Step 8. Close the Properties window and start your game!

&amp;nbsp;

**B.** The Quick But Inefficient Solution

The reason this approach is inefficient is because it will cause your GPU to constantly run

I myself was quite disappointed with the fact that I had to install 14 packages from repos and 21 packages from AUR

**Details**:

The hack basically consists of  two parts:

* replacing lib32-gtk3(which requires it and a dozen of its deps built from source) with lib32-gtk2(which is in multilib)

* compiling lib32-gconf without polkit support(lib32-polkit requires around dozen AUR packages)

**WARNING**:

Building lib32-gconf with this PKGBUILD

**Additional hint**: if you don't use any software that uses GTK3(which IMO is bloated and comes with tons of unnecessary stuff)

So please test to see if it really helps. It would be great if it does.

I am happy to report that it is quite possible to use a game controller with SOME Steam Games

But *Puddle* doesn't take full advantage of the 11 or so buttons or the three controller pads that a game like *Half-Life* or *Team Fortress 2* could.  And My left hand would really like to meet the right hand on a game controller rather than playing Finger Twister with the keyboard.

So this is a call to all Valve fans

Another thing that would be nice to have would be to see *Portal* come to Steam for Linux.  There are probably a million or so threads about this, the whole reason I signed up for Steam was so that I could play *Portal*.  But given how Valve just went through a round of layoffs including the lovely Jeri Ellsworth, and the entire Video Game and VFX industry is going through a financial crunch while Hollywood and Silicon Valley write corporate executives big bonus checks, putting *Portal* on Linux doesn't seem likely at this present time.

It occurred to me, gain a new lease of life and be enjoyed by a whole new audience. In fact, not just The Suffering, but other games that used the Riot Engine (Drakan).

It occurs to me that there are a lot of games like this, underrated, and based on technologies that are no longer worth protecting, but still rigidly locked to a given set of platforms.

Short of the surveys carried out on rainy Geography trips many years ago

The survey is quite short and should only take a couple of minutes. None of the questions are compulsory

I'm not sure if this'll see the light of day
