A friend of mine told me once that shit always happens when it rains. She was right. 

The last load of the weekend (yesterday afternoon), and I packed the main before both jumps - (I don’t own my own equipment yet, and have been trying out different rigs at the DZ to make an informed decision for when buy).

Dive exit and a quick ‘cannon-ball’ before going flat and pitching at around the 3000’ mark. I probably waited about two seconds before checking my burble, a bag at almost line stretch and those lines starting to spin up. My first thought? *“I hope I don’t have to cut away – I’ll have to find the main and freebag”* – Probably not the most common reaction (or is it?)

I tug the lines in a futile attempt to free what I assume to be the last rubber band keeping the bag closed, before bed, when I’m bored on the train, and before I get in to the plane. Look, Locate, Peel, Punch

Shit. The next thing I know I’m jarred upright (it was a pretty brisk opening) and there are these beautiful red handles and pure white above my head. I use my risers to move away from jump run and stow my handles in my jumpsuit. I look up and realise that this reserve looks a bit smaller than what I’m used to

The main and freebag were already back inside before I walked through the doors (it landed just downwind from the landing area). I sat down in a corner and undid my straps as everything hit me at once. “What if someone else jumped that rig after I packed it?”, “I wonder how much a reserve repack is?”. 

After the usual questions from everyone as to what happened, and went home. Still shaking.

TL;DR: Jump 47, bag lock, under fully inflated reserve just above 1000’.

--

So after this poorly written wall of text

* When did you have your first mal? Have you even had one yet?
* Did you sleep well that night?
* How were you when you landed your reserve? Relieved? Scared? A weird combination of the two?
* Reserve parachutes are designed/packed to open fast

I became obsessed with skydiving when my Dad started jumping when I was 10 years old. That was 25 years ago. I did my 1st tandem when I was 14 (Australia has the best tandem rules). I did a total of 3 tandems while waiting to turn 16

At 19 I moved away to go to University and became even more broke

There was a long gap in my log book until I was 21. I went back out for a few solo jumps and loved being back in the air. I just didn't have anyone else in my life who was into it. I've always been someone who needs to share an obsession with a crew of people to stay motivated Add to this the high cost of the sport and the fact that I was busy spending my meager funds on other things... well you get the picture.

Fast forward to my lasy jump 6 years ago. I was 28 and had been out of the air for about the same length of time as my most recent break. I was moving interstate and decided that I should really go back out to Toogoolawah and get current again before leaving the area.

I bought two jump tickets, but it wasn't until I went to investigate further in the toilets that I realised how bad it was. In the space of 10 minutes the inside of my thigh was completely bruised a hideous purple. 10 minutes later when the adrenaline had all worn off I was in huge amounts of pain. So much so that I couldn't face another opening and had to call it quits.

As you can imagine

Another 6 years past but skydiving had never left my thoughts. I still watched skydiving videos

I've recently moved to Phoenix

I went through the half day ""1st jump course"" and was happy and proud that I still remembered everything I had learned ~20 years ago. I had a near perfect repeat of AFF stage 1, docking, tracking. Perfect.

So they signed me off as an A licensed jumper and I was able to get in a jump at the Rookie Roundup event at Eloy on the weekend to celebrate. That jump was chaos and I was harshly reminded that no matter how easily I picked everything back up and felt comfortable in the air

And I'm so eager and excited to climb that curve and improve with every jump.

If you're out at Eloy and want a jump with an eager newb,False,self,t5_2rkgw,False,,,t3_1cy7u6

My Grandfather has Alzheimer’s and has trouble remembering what was said 2 minutes ago

He saw the picture of me with my student rig on and said, Grandpa's memory about things going on around him is fuzzy.  But when he got to talking about skydiving, he remembered the terminology perfectly.  There was no hesitation in his speech and he was really happy.  It was like the Alzheimer’s dropped away.  I grew up knowing he used to be a pilot that could fly everything from 747s to little Piper Cubs, but I never knew he did paratrooper training.  That was a really cool conversation.

There are a lot of details about my Grandpa’s military service that he never did talk about due to its “sensitive” nature.  Today was just awesome because I found out my Grandpa used to be a skydiver and I got to see him happy.  Next time I go out to the DZ,False,self,t5_2rkgw,False,,,t3_i884w

However, and that usual bullshit line ""Why would you jump out of a perfectly good airplane?"" 


It seems to be really difficult for people to grasp the reality that some people want to fly, but so is going flying a plane, joining the army etc, skydiving just has that extra public perception about it that puts it into a very small box. 
 

Meh, I would far sooner ask an accountant ""why would you spend your life doing that shit?"" then again, he probably does it so he *can* skydive.

2) Do the Pro-Tracks that you have to wear a distraction? How much do they affect your freefall?

2b) According to the rules, and if this were to happen, would it effectively disqualify you?

3) How much experience in other disciplines did you have before starting to speed skydive? What skills do you think are necessary to have before attempting to speed skydive?

4) The normal exit height is 4, and the recorded speed is the average between 2,700 meters (8,858 ft) and 1,700 meters (5,577 ft). How critical is the 1300 meters before passing through the first 'gate'? Would additional height be of any benefit (e.g. would jumping from 15,000 ft provide you with better chances of falling faster where it counts?)

I'm very thankful that everyone survived even though they have a swag of injuries among them including; a broken pelvis and fractured cheekbone, an injury to the neck that requires monitoring, (the recipient of which was very disappointed that his brand new relwork suit was cut off his body until they dosed him up with morphine).

Edit: the passengers  also suffered burns from the fuel, including the emergency services put in a selfless effort to help those in need.

I think we're incredibly fortunate not to have lost anyone

started &amp; what is the intended interpretation.


When sequential RW was just getting started in the mid 1970s it started in ST, TX, KS, IL western USA. Jumpsuits were small. Most skydivers wore boots. Belly reserves and ripcords were the norm.


Of course, the myth of **the right stuff** vanished. If Heydorn could bounce, ANYBODY can bounce! Thus, the brighter pioneer sequential types began to notice that the quality/quantity of people getting killed by impact appeared random... **good** skydivers and **bad** skydivers both bounced about as high. We noticed that it was not that **He screwed up** but rather that fate is the hunter and there is a real element of chance in skydiving.


We learned that the bright blue friendly sky was balanced, as a group were termed **black death**. The exit count used by my 8-way teams and several others was **Blue sky/ Black Death**. Sport parachuting became **Sport Death**. While the Black Death thing was an insider thing which translated to **Hey yall, lets avoid danger up there** it later got adopted and/or banned by folks who did not and do not understand what it means.


So just as **goodby** means **God be with you**


**Blue sky/black death** is a salute to the sky/earth that means
something like **lovely up there/watch out**

I know all the requirements to become certified as an instructor. 

When I did my first (and only) jump two years ago I had a million questions and only a little time to talk to the instructor that I jumped with. He worked full-time and traveled with the seasons, life got in the way and I didn't have the time or finances to keep jumping.

Now I'm doing what I have to do to afford the certification process. 500 jumps and 3 years from this spring I fully intend to begin the instructor certification process. Any instructors out there willing to share their personal situations? No need to share personal details like what you make a year

1. Do you work as an instructor full-time and or/year round or do you have other part-time jobs that you do year round/seasonally? Do you travel with the seasons?

2. Do you just do instruction or do you do other things around the DZ? (Packing parachutes, etc.)

3. If you work part-time

4. What the highest/lowest you've earned per tandem jump?

5. What the average amount one can expect per coaching session?

6. Are there certain types of training you get paid more for teaching? (Free flying, wingsuit, etc)

7. Anything else you feel is valuable information for an insanely interested individual that visits this sub-reddit every single day because he can't think of anything else.

It was all kind of surreal and fun from the get go. Before we loaded, were coach rated, aff instructor rated, or tandem instructor rated. I felt damn sure getting on the Otter that my gear was all correct. Someone even reminded me to tuck my braids into my helmet. One of the guys who is a regular load organizer put himself by the door so he could help me spot and watch me. Cool.

I'm used to being one of the first ones on a load, other jumper, me. That position has a weird safety belt. I felt like an idiot because I did not know where on my harness to hook it to. Fortunately no one else thought that way (or at least voiced it) and I was helped out with my dilemma.

Ok, if I fell out of the plane, I had a parachute on after all! In the plane I got another two gear checks. The ride to altitude was sooooo very nerve wrackingly short! Before I knew it, the green light was on.

Out went the first two guys. They both had some awesome exits (they have had 100's of jumps each). Then before I could blink

WHEEEEEEE! Totally freaking unstable.  I suck at diving exits. I started to reach for my pilot chute, took a deep breath, got stable, waved and threw off.  I was at about 4,500'.

My parachute had the end cells all nicely curled up and not inflated.  No biggee. I reached for my toggles.  Grabbed the left one and totally missed the right one. And a fast dive to the right ensued. Muttered a few chosen words and grabbed the right toggle. Pumped the brakes a few times and finally had nice clean nylon above me. On my previous jump I flew for a good while with the right end cell closed because I just couldn't clear it. The canopy was steerable and flying good and I DID eventually clear it.

I whooped and hollered because I knew that I had just done very well. The canopy ride was cool too because I managed to do a decent front riser turn for the first time. It took all my strength (I'm on a 190 right now. Fully geared I weigh about 140ish)

CSC has a HUGE student landing area. I love it. But it is way far away from the hangar. I stowed the brakes, and nothing could wipe the smile off of my face.

The debriefing:  Apparently most everyone on the plane (remember all those coaches and instructors?) was worried immediately about my exit.  The load organizer said he saw me flip over and reach for my handle before I was stable. He was happy when he saw me return to an arch and get right before throwing. So basically I was told in a very nice and constructive way by about ten people that I need to work on my exits. This kind of made me chuckle.

I realized today just how many people I have looking out for me and love teaching.  The skydiving community is a great one.  And I learned that I actually LIKE sitting by the door.

1370115007.0,1fh870,How to deal with unsafe jumpers. Story inside,b_masterfleX,15,2,16,"So yesterday I was at my home DZ making some jumps. On my second jump I go up with two jumpers whom I have never met before. Before we even got in the plane I could tell that one of the jumpers was very inexperienced with only 13 jumps, it was not until we were already off the ground that I learned she had never jumped out of a 182 before. On the ride up her boyfriend talked her into hanging off the strut then letting go When it was time to jump. Again I could see she was not comfortable with doing that. I tried to explain to her the proper way to climb out of a cessna because the wind is very powerful. So when we get the 3 minute call she turns to her boyfriend and say ""I have no idea where the DZ is"". Now she is sitting at the door and is going to be the first one to exit. So when the door opens she begins to climb out to hang off the strut

My question is how do you approach someone who you know is trying something they shouldnt be? I have only 44 jumps so I felt like I should have said something but was not sure what to say or do.

Back at my home DZ everything was easy and the instructors were great. They ended up getting shut down and I moved west. I am just trying to get current and I realize that the USPA has so many rules that just seem to be unnecessary. I am all for having an organized body which can provide recommendations and can help unify the sport but skydiving is supposed to be about fun and respect for the sport. 

Recently it seems that the USPA is just a money taking organization with motives much like goodell over at the NFL. If it were just me I would try to be patient and get over it but for the past month I have been trying to introduce a female friend to the sport. She cant wait to go but there is so much bureaucratic stuff in the way - (1st - my membership renewal got delayed

The point is that there are regulations over when I can start jumping with a camera. What i need to be wearing. When I can start to do wingsuit

I think we need a regulating body for tandems and we need safety for the DZ planes and such but I just am cautious of where to draw the line. I am VERY OPEN to discussion and am curious about what some of you have to say. Also - please refrain from criticizing me or anyone else over an opinion (you should know I take safety very seriously and actually am signed up to take a few safety courses on my own but I do not want to have more mandated things.. I am broke enough already.) I was training to be a private pilot and got up to my solo when I decided to stop because of all the FAA B.S. and I do NOT want that to happen to skydiving.

I'm honestly about to leave with all the sexist shit going, frustrating as all hell, and most attempts at shutting them up are met with replies of 'screwing with dropzone etiquette.'

It's painfully obvious why there are so few returning women at this particular drop zone, into skydiving in general. Which makes me substantially less likely in inviting friends and family anywhere near the sport.
