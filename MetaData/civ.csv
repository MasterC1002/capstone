There is no possible way anyone can argue to the contrary. I was already tired of being labeled a warmongerer for literally THOUSANDS of years for any sort of skirmish early on in the game. That was bad enough. 

The game that I'm currently in though? I haven't been in a war for the entirety of the game, in true Attila fashion, he continued to warmonger the entire game. He was starting random wars with civilizations, demanding tribute from city-states, he TOOK OVER and puppeted two city-states, and just acted like a total douchebag. Every other civilization had denounced him and more or less hated him.

Atilla had been demanding tribute from a city-state I was protecting, asking me if we could finally deal with Attila once and for all. I agreed, and we went to war. Attila has about 8 cities, and I moved in and puppeted one of them...

And now I'm a warmongerer! Everyone except for Genghis thinks I'm a warmongerer. Hell

1369001289.0,1enm6r,Civilization 5 Ultimate FAQ and Guide,DasAsch,912,133,241,"I often see new players asking relatively easily-answerable questions. I *also* see intermediate-level players asking the very same questions

I myself am an Immortal/Emperor player (Deity just isn't fun for me) with 400 hours of play. *Note that the following tips are for the Gods and Kings expansion.* 

**MOST/MUCH OF THIS NO LONGER HOLDS TRUE IN BNW
--------------------------------------------------
 
&gt;**When do I go up in difficulty?**

This is a great question. The best way to gauge your ability to go up in difficulty is your ability to win through Science- you'll learn the military and diplomacy after you go up in level. The numbers below indicate when to move to the corresponding level from the previous. (these are just suggestions)

* Deity: turn 275 
* Immortal turn 325
* Emperor turn 375
* King turn 400
* Prince turn 425

&gt;**How do I manage my armies? I keep losing/I cant take that city!**

* **What techs to aim at for military (in this order):** Construction for Composite Bowmen, Industrialization for Gatling Guns, Flight/Radar for Bombers, Rocketry for Rocket Artillery, Mobile Tactics for Mechanized Infantry (*Sometimes, IGNORE THIS and go for UNIQUE UNIT: example is Mongols must go straight for Keshiks, Japan for Samurai
* **What to build:** Here are the basic principles"":

1. Don't bother with melee units

1. Tactic: set your ranged units all around the city and bombard it- keep a single mounted unit nearby (usually 3 tiles away from the city) to swoop in and capture. EDIT: Have a 1-2 melee units with Shock I

* **How to upgrade:** 

 1. Get the 3 levels of either the rough or open terrain bonuses (Shock/Drill and Accuracy/Barrage) 
 1. Now you can go for Logistics on ranged units, get Cover/Medic to tank damage for your ranged units.
 1. NEVER get both rough AND open bonuses and don't bother with Cover/Medic/Seige

* **Don't let your upgraded units die:** if you manage to get a unit to level 3+, and automatic healing.
* **Great Generals:** once you get one
* **City traps:** capture an enemy city

&gt;**How do I expand early?**

* **Best build capital orders:** Scout-Worker/Shrine (if going full Tradition), Warrior-Warrior (not recommended- only on early game rushes). After that, build archers!
* **Recommended Early Tech Order**: Animal Husbandry-Pottery-Luxury Technologies - Archery. After that
* **Steal workers**: plant a warrior near a neighboring city state. As soon as they build a worker, and immediately make piece. They'll hate you, but it will disappear fast. You can hopefully get 1-2 early game workers this way.
* **SELL!:** You don't want to waste time building
http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=468487
* **Settle:** on a hill if you can. Its better defensively and gives you better production. Also
* **Early military:** If you're Attila/Alexander you may want to spam Hoplites/Battering Rams and go conquering. Otherwise
* **Social policies:** See next section.

&gt;**How do I manage my culture?/What policies should I go for??**

* **Early game Social Policies:** There are 2 options here to go for:

1. Full Tradition: , then Landed Elite and finish up Tradition. Snowballs later with awesome growth on first 4 cities you settle. Probably the easiest too. (no building monuments!)

1. Liberty/Mixed: (optionally) Open Tradition then open liberty and go for Collective Rule and Citizenship for the free settler/worker. You can either finish liberty now or you can go back and do tradition. A great trick is if you have monuments built

* **What to avoid:** Unfortunately
 1. Never go Honor. Some people always try to make it work
 1. Never go Piety/Patronage. EDIT: They can be great too! Piety is often mandatory for culture wins and patronage is great too. But new players would improve simply by skipping them.
 1. Commerce is *okay* but its only worth it if Rationalism isn't unlocked. Otherwise

* **What you SHOULD use:**
 1. Tradition-Rationalism-Freedom (4 city science)
 1. Traditon/Liberty-Piety-Freedom-Tradition/Liberty-something (4 city culture victory
 1. Liberty-Rationalism-Autocracy (military focused empire)

* **Some more tips:**

 1. Even if you decide to fill out Liberty
 1. Rationalism is the best tree
 1. Although I didn't mention it earler
 1. Every new city you own makes policies cost much more. Stick to 3-4 for best efficiency. Puppets don't count
 1. Patronage is great to open and get Aesthetics. Then
 1. Piety is great but only if you're going for a culture victory. Otherwise

&gt;**How do I keep my Science output high?**

* **Maximize GROWTH:** Unless you plan to have lots and lots of cities
 1. Prioritize growth buildings after science ones. Granary
 1. Make sure you always have enough workers. A terrible oversight is only having 2-3 workers by turn 90. You should have as many as you can handle
 1. Always keep your empire happy. Prioritize happiness buildings after science and before growth if your empire is almost unhappy. (also gives +15% science with Rationalism)
 1. ALWAYS aim for Civil Service (extra food on riverside farms) and Fertilizer (extra food on all farms). Both are great techs. 
* Aim for Science Technologies in most conditions
* Make sure you use your science specialists. With Rationalism (and Freedom!) Specialists can give you 100-500+ science per turn on top of what you already have. 
* Settle your cities next to mountains if you can. That unlocks Observatories

&gt;**How do I cultivate my religion? (dont miss out on a religion in G&amp;K!)**

* How to start your religion: build lots of shrines early game, Messenger of the Gods (wide science), and Sacred Waters (happiness).
* Founder beliefs: Ceremonial Burial/Peace Loving can be good for happiness
* Follower beliefs: Pagodas is the best for Happiness+Faith
* Enhancer: always Religious Texts
* Its good to get a missionary before your second Prophet.

&gt;**Misc**

* Constantly check Demographics. Make sure you're not too far behind in Science
* You can win easily Diplomatic by saving up gold
* AI is irrational. They will probably just backstab you

Oops! I ran out of space! Part 2 anyone? (only if you guys ask me though!) Maybe I'll make a thorough Culture/Dom walkthrough! Oh

I then made privateers and a few ground troops to completely blockade all workable tiles by that city


This way I controlled the population. I would move units off food tiles to let the city grow


By water, which easily covered the upkeep cost of the handful of units needed for the blockade and then some good profit. 



This way, then farm back down for ca**$**h and e**X**p, usually leaving the city at 1 Pop with 0 HP, then letting it grow back again.

I play big games with max players



I did leave one hex open though. One hex onto where the city would occasionally pop out a unit, and it would instantly get gibbed by the ranged units I had blockading the city. 



Once in a while, the unit would attrition die. 



So that way units would pop, and the soldiers outside camping your farms.

1372351933.0,1h6s40,How Civ I Almost Got me booted from the USMC.,phuckcats,698,106,58,"Hey everyone

Shortly after that I brought my Texas Instruments computer down with me to pass the time as I was working shift work and with a lot of down time during the day when most of my friends were working I figured I could get into a game. Shortly after that while perusing the local Radio Shack I stumbled upon a box with a pharaoh's tomb with a city skyline built on top of it. The game was called Civilization.

Having always been somewhat interested in history and playing RPG's growing up I figured I'd give this game a shot. WHOA. 

My nights turned into ""One More Turn"" agony for months on end when I was fighting off Shaka or Elizabeth. After a while others started to notice the game I was playing and asking about it. Within a few weeks of me purchasing the game it had been installed on at least 12 other computers in the barracks (sorry Microprose) and it was nothing for me to field questions about tactics or strategy all night long.

After two months just about everyone in the barracks were playing as well as guys from other barracks adjacent (French Creek area if you are familiar with Lejeune) to ours were also playing to all hours of the night.

I then got a visit from our Company XO who somehow had traced the game that was turning out Marines too tired for Physical Training and their job because they were up all night playing it to me

So

So, it almost cost me my career in the Marines and I now have a wife that knows when a  new DLC or Expansion comes out, she won't be seeing much of me for a few weeks.

Thanks for reading.

I've never owned a Civ game, do a turn or two, leave for a couple hours, do another turn, repeat? Think of the mobile scrabble games that have been coming out. Do you have to sit there during the game or is it normal for someone to take 5+ hours per every couple turns?

~~

Everything is going well; focussing on acquiring gold any way I can; any Wonder that improves gold or expands trade routes is a priority. I claim the City State of Ragusa on the south coast,"" I say to myself, ""I can get my borders to join before Cardiff grows enough to split my Empire in two.""

I don't have a strong Faith

And then I see a Celtic Great Prophet heading my way. I search through the diplomatic options fruitlessly

I think ""Maybe

The Great Prophet of Catholicism preaches his message to the fickle citizens of Venice and they convert. Shinto's Holy City has fallen to the Heretics. I languish in despair for a turn as I check out what Catholicism can do for me...nothing as good as the benefits Shintoism had.

Something clicks within and I gather all of my troops and send them towards the newly founded city of Cardiff. Stationed on the border

But, to assist in quick attacks.

""I've noticed a few of your troops quite close to our border

""Not to worry

I take stock of the land mass. There are 4 City States on the main bulk. The Celts are in the middle. They have no allies. They're isolated. They're mine. I launch my war.

Thousands of arrows and burning rubble rain down on the city of Cardiff. In one turn I have decimated the city and taken it for my own. I set my sights on Dublin.

Buying more troops

And then I remember: I had Bowmen north of Dublin to keep an eye out for Barbarians raiding my trade routes. Within 3 turns, a Swordsman and a Knight; all with their eyes fixed on Dublin. Another Trebuchet and a couple of Bowmen guard the borders of Edinburgh.

While I circle the City of Dublin with my troops

Boudicca has a request for peace. She is willing to give me Dublin if I end the war. A nice offer in any other time, ""this will be over quickly.""

All my ranged units attack both Dublin and Edinburgh. I lose my Knights to defence artillery from the cities but it does not matter. Each turn I rain arrows and flame down upon the Celts. I hear the screams of Catholics begging for mercy. The defences of Dublin fall. Garrisoned troops are all that remain.

The Pictish Warriors have spirit, the last warrior witnesses my Swordsman marching into his city, claiming it for my own. He dies a broken man.

Edinburgh is surprisingly weak and cannot even stand against half of my army. I almost feel sorry for Boudicca as she approaches me one last time

I survey my army, but until then I will contend with the less beneficial features of Catholicism.

Looking again at the strength of my army

There are only two buildings in the game that have theming bonuses that allow artifacts - museums and the Louvre.  Other than that

I know that I could choose to build a Landmark

Here are some ideas I've had that could have made the process more enjoyable:

1. Sell artifacts for gold.  It happens all the time in the real world.  The amount you get for the artifact depends on how old it is compared to the current era.
2. Use to generate science.  Universities study archaeological/anthropological digs all the time.  Allow the option to consume them for a one-time science boost (again based on its age compared to the current age).
3. Give it to the appropriate civ for a diplomatic boost.  Dug up a Wittenberg artifact?  Give it to Wittenberg
4. Give the option to delete artifacts that are cluttering up your slots.  If I just had a Great Artist pop

I played as Venice on a random map type with everything standard. I started out on a small continent with visibility on two city states.I quickly bumped into Germany to my south and England to the east. I decided to do heavy trading with Germany and gave in a few times when he asked for gold or a resource. When the deal expired and he asked to renew it I just charged him. :-)

Up until ideology's everyone was declaring friendship, etc. Sadly, me, Germany, and Hiawatha went order. The other players went freedom. I actually went order because Germany did and we'd been such solid friends that I didn't want to ruin it. That's what led to my downfall last deity attempt. 

The first world congress was ran by England and Germany. I backed both of their proposals so everyone was happy and at this point I was making a ton of gold so I started buying up city states as allies. I wasn't able to get enough votes to win the host of the congress so I backed Germany. At this point England and the Swedish decided they hated me for order so they DoW. 

It does not go well for them. I'm small but I have several artillery, and some subs. Using my hilly terrain and buying the city states around England we were able to destroy most of his attackers. I ask for peace but they both laughed at me so I did the reasonable thing and took England's city of York. :-) around this time I finally get selected as the host of the world congress. As a gift to Germany I choose order as the world ideology. It easily passes with just my votes. 

I also have to mention that England had taken one of my city state allies but the two other city state allies that surrounded it took it back for me. Awesome! 

Germany finished wiping England off the map and I failed to win the world leader vote the first time. However

The turn before the vote I'm able to lock up the last two votes and the rest is history. I apologize for the rambling but the world needed to know of my conquest. Enjoy.

###The Iroquois (Hiawatha)

Starting Location Bias: Forest

**Unique Ability: The Great Warpath**

Units move through Forest and Jungle in friendly territory as if it is Road. These tiles can be used to establish Trade Routes upon researching The Wheel.

**Unique Unit: Mohawk Warrior**

* Cost: 75 Production/150 Faith
* Melee Unit
* Combat Strength: 14
* Movement: 2
* Replaces: Swordsman

The Mohawk Warrior is exactly like the Swordsman

**Unique Building: Longhouse**

* Cost: 100 Production
* Maintenance: 2
* Production: +2
* Specialists: One Engineer 
* Replaces: Workshop
* Gives +1 production for each worked forest tile.

The two greatest strengths of the Iroquois are the fact that they save a lot of GPT by not needing roads until railroads are researched, their bonuses are pretty much moot. Hiawatha’s AI is, in my experience, very expansionistic, friendly, and loyal. However, I can’t forget the time he tried to Mohawk rush me in the last game I played.

Fun facts:
Hiawatha is tied with Catherine for second most likely to build and use nukes.

My population was stagnant. I had few resources, that was my existence and I was determined to progress forward at any cost!

My people didn't have irrigation nor granaries but there was one weapon that could give our nation the respect that it deserved. So I bided my time

While my opponents continued to war against each other, but when you are aware of its imminentness, it is as quick as a flash. The end-game had arrived.

My diplomats had done enough reconnaissance for me to know where to strike first. Within a turn I had conquered 3 capitals

Now they were coming to me for peace. Little did they know that the fate of their empires was already sealed. My swift and destructive actions had not come without a cost though. As I was walking into the last few cities under infidel control, I only had 5 or 6 cities of my own remaining, but I had done it. I had beaten the game.

Usually when you kill all your opponents, the only nation left on my planet was my own. This glitch happened so infrequently that this was the first time I had ever hit it.

For completeness sake I decided to play on. I advanced my nation technologically, my cities continued to fall. The planet's temperature continued to climb and my people continued to starve. We had survived nearly a hundred years after the fall of the last opponent but all that was left was my beloved capital. This was the city from which my great empire began, and it was falling. Not by the sword of an enemy as I had always hoped but by circumstances that were now out of anyone's control.

I tried everything that I could. I built granaries and irrigation but what's the point when there's no food and water. My population dwindled. 2000 one year

A new feature called ""Goodwill."" It would effectively be diplomacy in numeric form

How would you earn it? By being at peace. Every Civ you have an embassy with might generate, you generate nothing from that Civ. I am not opposed to having buildings generate Goodwill, but it should not be the primary source. And of course policies, Wonders, UAs, etc. could enhance these numbers.

You could then use this Goodwill in negotiations. Need a sweetener for a deal? Add 100 Goodwill to it. Need to stop a war or start one? Throw some goodwill into the mix. The Goodwill would then transfer to the other civ (or, or the effort to assuage tensions, or whatever.

And what could you sink this Goodwill into? Goodwill will now be the primary way to become an ally of a City-State. Money can still be used as before but it will be much less effective. 

A new Great Leader, say, open up new options for City-State relations (change leader style, maybe? Or even type? Or open up more quests?) Perhaps even use it against a rival to force a peace treaty, but that may be too powerful. Or it could be used to erase diplomatic hits on your reputation. Or (maybe) take the place of the General for Land Grabs.

I am unsure if losing Goodwill per turn is a good idea (i.e. wars would cause you to lose Goodwill each turn). Maybe one-time hits for sneak attacks or caught spies

Thoughts? Concerns?

Edit: also

Edit2: Thinking about it some more

Edit3: I get that ""Goodwill"" or Diplomacy can't be quantified in real life,"" but it can easily be changed; I don't want to call it ""Diplomacy"" because that is already an existing concept in the game, and things like ""Influence"" or ""Political capital"" sound more like domestic policies then international.

1366819758.0,1d0lz5,How the AI computes YOUR military strength (based from the c++ DLL files),Putmalk,281,27,69,"THIS IS FOR CIVILIZATION V.

This is taken from CvDiplomacyAI.cpp

&gt; Single unit's power = ((Power * (promotionLevel^0.3 )) * Current Health) / Max Health.

The game's formula to calculate a unit's **power** (different than **strength**) is complicated. In general

&gt; melee: ((combat^1.5 * move^0.3) / 2 (ONLY IF THIS IS A SUICIDE UNIT) + 4000 (IF THIS UNIT CAN NUKE) + Promotion bonus)

&gt; ranged: ((ranged^1.45 * move^0.3) / 2 (ONLY IF THIS IS A SUICIDE UNIT) + 4000 (IF THIS UNIT CAN NUKE) + Promotion bonus)

The promotion bonus is stupidly complicated and annoying. Essentially it tries to take a percentage of the bonus each promotion gives a unit and adds and subtracts based on their value. In most cases it will only vary the +/- by a small amount. You're better off calculating each unit individually then posting the code. In general

Let's take a Warrior who is level 2 (30 xp) and half health.

((**27.86** * (2^0.3 )) * 50) / 100 = ((8 * (1.23)) * 50) / 100 = 9.85 * 50 / 100 = 492.5 / 100 = **17.15** Total Power

The 27.86 comes from the revised formula above.

Relevant code:

    int CvUnit::GetPower() const
    {
        VALIDATE_OBJECT
        int iPower = getUnitInfo().GetPower();
        //Take promotions into account: unit with 4 promotions worth &gt; ~50% more
        iPower = int((float) iPower * pow((double) getLevel()
        iPower *= GetCurrHitPoints();
        iPower /= GetMaxHitPoints();
        return iPower;
    }

How to calculate player's current military might:

&gt; TotalUnitPower = Add every unit's power together

&gt; GoldMultiplier = 1 + (sqrt(YourCurrentGold) / 100)

GoldMultiplier cannot be higher than 2 (will only happen if you have 10

Calculating might formula:

&gt; Total Might = (TotalUnitPower * GoldMultiplier).

Let's assume you have 2500 gold in your treasury

If you then had 235 total unit power

Relevant code:

    int CvPlayer::calculateMilitaryMight() const
    {
    	int rtnValue = 0;
    	const CvUnit* pLoopUnit;
    	int iLoop;
    
    	for(pLoopUnit = firstUnit(&amp;iLoop); pLoopUnit != NULL; pLoopUnit = nextUnit(&amp;iLoop))
    	{
    		// Current combat strength or bombard strength
    		int iPower =  pLoopUnit-&gt;GetPower();
    		if (pLoopUnit-&gt;getDomainType() == DOMAIN_SEA)
    		{
    			iPower /= 2;
    		}
    		rtnValue += iPower;
    	}
    
    	//Simplistic increase based on player's gold
    	//500 gold will increase might by 22%
    	float fGoldMultiplier = 1.0f + (sqrt((float)GetTreasury()-&gt;GetGold()) / 100.0f);
    	if(fGoldMultiplier &gt; 2.0f) fGoldMultiplier = 2.0f;
    
    	rtnValue = (int)(rtnValue * fGoldMultiplier);
    
    	return rtnValue;
    }

The AI always considers you to have at least 30 strength

Now the AI takes a ratio:

&gt; Military Ratio = (TheirMilitaryMight) * 100 / OurMilitaryStrength

If we (the AI) have 250 strength and they (the opponent (human or AI)) have 500 strength, the ratio is 50.

Now the AI does checks based on this ratio. Keep in mind if one if is satisfied the ones below it aren't

If ratio &gt; 250

If ratio &gt; 165

If ratio &gt; 115

If ratio &gt; 85

If ratio &gt; 60

If ratio &gt; 40

If it's less than that

And that's how the AI determines its military strength vs. yours!

    {
    	CvAssertMsg(ePlayer &gt;= 0

""Stupid Question: Don't Upvote""

This is done (as far as I can see) for two reasons. Firstly, some may use ""pls dont upvote"" as a way to gain more visbility. That is just irritating.

The other reason is that people don't think their post is ""good enough"" for the front page. Reddit is all about community and usefulness. If people have the same question as you, and if people think it is detrimental they will downvote it.

there is no reason to ask ""don't upvote."" It's not like there is a limited number of upvotes

A quick search for ""upvote"" on this sub gives an absurd amount of these posts. One, has ~1000 score, with the top comment being ""Don't tell me what to do.""

So please, and stop with the formulaic ""Do not upvote"" line.

""Ahmad

""Not today, arm, prepare for his power spike to wear off""

And so they did. For a thousand years both of the great leaders alternated building units and culture buildings as they watched helplessly while Montezuma swallowed the Arabian nation like an insatiable beast. 

Cries for help fell on deaf ears as city by city was taken and razed by wild animals pitifully disguised as humans.

""Ahmad

He agreed

Korean and Moroccan Citizens and soldiers fought gallantly

Once more

Dictator Sejong had only one more nation to bend to his will: the cultured Aztec people. 

""All efforts to researching the internet!"" The excited autocrat barked at his scientists

And brilliant korean scientists slaved away at realizing their ruler's dream only to hear

""Montezuma has completed the Great Firewall!""

Tourism plummeted. A lamenting Sejong wept bitterly as he read that his brother

Suddenly, sprung into the power-mad leader's mind.

""We must be first

The idea started as a funny little question a hundred years earlier

""The Moroccan People must be eliminated"" a tired leader whispered to his advisors.

""But you can't!""

""The moroccans are practically our people too!""

""We have to keep diplomatic options open!""

""***SILENCE***"" Sejong demanded

Heads hung around the table

""Now

Six great scientists showed up in the People's Korean Palace. 

""You

The Scientists were led to an archaeological site and systematically sacrificed before the God of War to ensure that the Korean army would be armed with X-Com squads, Sejong ordered his archaeologists to construct a Landmark to commemorate their keeping of their duty.

""Make it happen"" a deeply saddened sejong ordered his military advisor.

The Korean people flew into action

All of this was done quietly

In July of 2047

The people were slaughtered wholesale as volley after volley of death came crashing into their hometown. Only after the killing had supposedly ended, Women, and Children were lined up in the street, every other one being killed regardless of age, gender, or physical state. 

Sejong stared into the distance and saw tanks, less powerful Atomic Bomb to fend them off. The people of Seoul understood the necessity of their sacrifice as the bomb was detonated only miles from the city center. 

Sejong approached his brother

As the turn timer clicked over to 500, bitter sentence left Sejong's mouth: *I've Won*.

My continent put up more of a fight than I had hoped, so I assume I'm in for a fight when I get there.


Build up a strong navy, that was landlocked, the superior Alex, declaration of friendship and all and who was just bro-fiving me over our joint victory against Dido, declares war. Oh, and EVERY city state (about 12 left) declare too. Within 1 turn I lost about 30 units and my entire navy (3x 3 battleship, 2 privateer groups) It's a losing war and I lose all but 3 cities tucked in the corner. 


I'm able to hold them


I rebuild my navy and use the standoff I get with them to pick away at coastal cities. Rape mobiles keep the inland locked down tight. I finally get a coastal city and 2 city states and Greece offers a giant peace agreement. I'm surprised he offered so much


Then comes the sneaky bit. **As soon as** I clicked agree to my 10 turn treaty the UN election screen pops up. 10 turns I can't attack him or city states and 10 turns to his victory.


Bonus epilogue:
So, pushing my last battleship, GA, destroyer (vitally important; the only unit that can win the game) and sub into a bay with his entire navy.  A carrier makes it just in time with 2 A-bombs and a bomber. I sold my entire army enroute to buy an ICBM in my newly annexed city state. The carrier with the A-bomb's last move put the bombs' farthest range 1 tile away from Greece's capital. An ICBM, logistics double salvo from the battleship, 2 A-bombs and a suicide run from the bomber put the city down to a coin flip's chance of the destroyer getting through. 1 more turn would have lost me the election.


I won the redo


**TL;DR**: Greece offers treaty as UN is completed and I can't attack to win before election is held.

**E:**

- I think it was on King difficulty. I haven't played in forever and was looking for something that wouldn't require an entire game of micro managing and would be relaxing (Spoiler: it wasn't).

- I did turn a blind eye to the city states. Most of my cash went into buying a majority of my initial navy.

- *May* have been a coincidence

- Spain, the Celts and Carthage minus the capital plus all of what used to be the Egypt now under new management.

I was reading through the civ of the week thread and saw a lot of people comment but I felt like it didn't capture the true power of Montezuma so I felt compelled to make this post. (Sorry for my dark humor ahead of time.)

He. Is. A. Beast. 

All you have to do is war war war and start more war. When the world is burning and in constant war

I dare say that no civ thrives from war like the Aztecs. They make Hitler and his German war machine look like a neutered puppy. America's shock and awe? More like shock and not enough death and sacrifice... 

Before I began my game I chose a terra map with 20 deity ai's and 15 city states on marathon speed. (Marathon speed is key here because it gives me time to travel with my jaguar warriors across the map and accumulate ridiculous amounts of culture.) 

I essentially started in a mediocre location this game... without any freaking lakes as usual -fml- and this is by no means my best Monty game because I was playing it safe since I was recording and it was also my first game in a long time so I forgot to promote my units properly...which set me back quite a bit... I usually get way more culture and go pure honor for the gold but this game I focused more on my economy and went with the liberty branch as well as honor. 

I started next to plains

http://i.imgur.com/q3sMUoX.jpg

As you can see Stockholm gave me a huge hard on because of the awesome location

Since I discovered some other civs I thought it was time for a change of plans. Sweden was done anyways. I drained them for every little bit of culture I could and stole all their workers and second city. I then turned my attention to France and Ethiopia. Both civs had NO defense. 

I decided to target the Ethiopia first because their capitol was right next to mine. A foolish mistake on their part
 
By turn 139 Ethiopia was begging for peace. Here is what turn 139 looked like: http://i.imgur.com/j5nCnqR.jpg

If you notice

IRONICALLY after destroying Ethiopia all of those countries ended up giving ME concessions for peace. I got some sweet items like luxuries and gold per turn and gold in general

This whole game I barely managed my capitol city or any city for that matter and I have more gold, I can't know this for fact.) Although if you look at demographics I'm probably in last place in almost all categories besides land because my cities aren't really producing or doing anything. This is pure diplomatic/military domination right here. If I wanted to manage cities I'd have pick the Egyptians.

After making peace with almost everyone I could

It was when I declared war on France that the world finally said ENOUGH. I couldn't make this up if I tried - America and Britain declared war on me that same turn. Then the rest of the world followed. IT WAS WW2 IN THE ANCIENT ERA!!!

Even before I could rob them of their money every country declared war on me... Except for the nations that I signed peace treaties with. They were all WAITING for the peace treaty to expire to declare war. 

Luckily the French had no city walls and their cities were basically located on flat terrain. It was easier to conquer France than Ethiopia. It was as if the French just straight up surrendered or something. I dunno

This is what the world looked like on turn 214: http://i.imgur.com/NJrBbEK.jpg

Notice Blood Desert and Arbalast? Those are the two cities I used my 2 settlers on. It was a very bloody time period. I had to essentially turtle and defend myself from all sides while using that time to build myself up economically. I was also running out of happiness so it was time for ethnic cleansing... And yes, and Sigtuna had horrible locations and they pissed me off so I destroyed those 3 cities and replaced them with my own cities. It was a purely strategic decision...

America is still at war with me. After I conquered France America never really forgave me

Anyways, then Byzantium, etc etc. 

Before long another world war broke out and I ended up on top through a series of military campaign. Luckily all the randomly timed peace treaties prevented me from having to fight everyone at once.

Eventually Spain gave me Barcelona. I took Mongolia's capital and the Arabs gave me Damascus. AND I FINALLY MANAGED TO TAKE DOWN STOCKHOLM!!! Luckily not a lot of damage was done to the jungles. (When I say gave

Here is the map on turn 336: http://i.imgur.com/1VMPSrt.jpg

Hilariously

The conflict between me and the U.S. basically escalated to cold war status. Britain and America were my top rivals trying to destroy me along with the rest of the world. By this point

At this point in the game London had more world wonders than any city in the game by a wide margin and they have been my goal for a long time so I began to rapidly advance east. I started by conquering Byzantium but had to give Constantinople to the Arabs because I didn't have enough happiness to manage it. Me and the Arabs share a religion and they are on friendly terms with me so I decide to throw them a bone.

After Byzantium fell

Turn 396: http://i.imgur.com/682APMJ.jpg

p.s. 

All my infantry began as Jaguar Warriors. They all gain health upon killing units and ignore jungle and forest terrain cost. I don't really need anymore infantry so the only thing I'll be making is artillery and archers from now on. I have 17 jaguar based infantry and 2 pikemen. Most of my units are levels 5-10+ and most of my archers have 3 range and 2 attacks through promotions because they had to deflect so many hordes of enemies. All of whom were promptly sacrificed for the glory of my gods. I'm one of the most cultured civilizations in the world haha. 

p.p.s.

I actually recorded the whole game on fraps if you guys want I can upload it on youtube

p.p.p.s.

I don't go for any specific victory, and militaristically. For me, it's about the process of building a great civ, not the victory itself. I find it odd that people aim for specific victories, but I guess those strategies are more geared towards human players.

I would assume a prevailing frustration with many players is the AI's seemingly ""random"" assignment of whether or not you're a warmonger. Well

This calculation applies to gods and kings. AI handles things a bit differently in vanilla...

First

- The AI has met the player conquering/declaring war.
- The AI can't be at war with the attacked player (they like it when you help them out with mutual wars). Only applies for declarations of war

Okay

- Conquered a Civilization: +10
- Conquered a City-State: +5
- DoW a Civilization: +5
- DoW a City-State: +5

Everytime you perform one of these actions (and the pre-existing conditions are met)

The AI really cares about your warmonger score

- Warmonger Score = warmongerAmount * [warmongerHate](http://i.imgur.com/vRUIU.jpg)

A pretty simple calculation which ensures that AIs that hate warmongers will view you as a warmonger more than AIs that don't.

Every turn, or declared war on either type.

Here's what your warmonger score will look several turns after an action:

    Action: Declared war on Civilization
    Warmonger Amount: 5
    AI #1: WarmongerHate of 3
    AI #2: WarmongerHate of 5
    AI #3: WarmongerHate of 7
    
    Turn #1:
    AI #1 Score: 5 * 3 = 15
    AI #2 Score: 5 * 5 = 25
    AI #3 Score: 5 * 7 = 35
    
    Turn #2:
    AI #1 Score: 4.95 * 3 = 14.85 =&gt; 14
    AI #2 Score: 4.95 * 5 = 24.75 =&gt; 24
    AI #3 Score: 4.95 * 7 = 34.65 =&gt; 34
    
    Turn #5:
    AI #1 Score: 4.75 * 3 = 14.25 =&gt; 14
    AI #2 Score: 4.75 * 5 = 23.75 =&gt; 23
    AI #3 Score: 4.75 * 7 = 33.25 =&gt; 33
    
    Turn #50:
    AI #1 Score: 2.5 * 3 = 7.5 =&gt; 7
    AI #2 Score: 2.5 * 5 = 12.5 =&gt; 12
    AI #3 Score: 2.5 * 7 = 17.5 =&gt; 17

    Turn #100:
    AI #1 Score: 0 * 3 = 0
    AI #2 Score: 0 * 5 = 0
    AI #3 Score: 0 * 7 = 0

After the AI's calculated your warmonger score

**Warmonger Threat**

- Score &gt;= 200: Critical
- Score &gt;= 150: Severe
- Score &gt;= 100: Major
- Score &gt;= 50: Minor

**A small addendum

**Usage of your Warmonger Threat:**

1. AI will warn you about your warmonger after Severe.
2. AI is more willing to team up against a high warmonger threat player
3. Your score divided by 2 will be factored into the AI's opinion of you
4. Your Foreign Advisor will warn you of their warmonger threat (at least, does this happen?)
5. Warmonger threat influences Guarded/Afraid Approaches.
6. A higher warmonger threat means the AI values you as a military threat more

Maybe this will shed insight on how the AI views you as a warmonger.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If anyone's curious

- conquering a minor and major are both worth 10 points.
- attacking a minor and major are both worth 5 points.
- once again
- No decay. The AI will **never** forget your warmongering.",self,t5_2rk3b,1369271886.0,,SMAC,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1eur0v/another_ai_evaluation_post_are_you_a_warmongerer/

I'm sure a lot of it can be chalked up to blind

Early game is largely dictated by the UA, and more knowledge regarding where to settle. Use the bonuses from your ruins to expand aggressively and gobble up all the good land. Buy units for defense using your gifts from city states. You're going to need a strong empire with good cities to power the war machine, and more importantly, you need to keep the best spots away from your enemies. This is where tile buying comes in - by strategically purchasing tiles in choke points, you can block off enemy expansion and entice them into declaring war on you without diplomatic penalty! There is no reason why you shouldn't have the best empire on your continent by the time the initial land grab is over.

When you hit the Renascence and everyone is good and settled in their land, putting you on the fast track to march/blitz (if you're going to build longswordsman in the medieval era give them the shock promotions; don't waste your free Drill I upon promotion). You'll be able to waltz your siege lanes right on up to cities and take them with minimal casualties. Don't believe me? Fight a war with minutemen in rough terrain and then try going back to standard units. I know I had a hard time making the transition. The icing on the cake is that unlike other UU's that go obsolete, the minuteman will keep it's extra movement as it's promoted - riflemen, GW Infantry, and Infantry keep all the tactical advantages that unhindered movement gives you. When you hit mechanized infantry (hopefully with march at this point) with their three movement points, you'll be steamrolling any land units you come across. Use your land army to secure a source of oil and prepare yourself for...

If any unit has the power to singlehandedly topple that massive runaway Hiawatha on the other continent, which improves your survivability even further, is only one promotion away. This comes quickly when you get to attack twice per turn. Nab the Brandenburg gate and build a military academy and you have a unit that starts out with FIVE promotions. Every B-17 you build in that city will have the same tactical effectiveness of 3-4 normal bombers, since you attack twice as much and stop to heal half as often. Don't be afraid to build GW bombers early on - give them the bombardment promotions and you'll have an excellent hybrid attacker when it comes time to upgrade. You'll be able to use them to help clear out any ground based AA once Evasion comes online. Bomb the enemy into submission, and swoop in with your minutemen turned infantry for the kill. It's amazing how quickly cities fall, especially once you get the third siege promotion. The only downside are those damn animations! You might wanna turn on quick combat. The only civ with the power to stand in your way is Japan and that cursed Zero with Bushido, but if you're facing large stacks of those you might want to consider taking a lesson from the history book and deploy a bomber with a different sort of payload... If you don't understand what I'm getting at

In summary, before finally leading up to the B17 which secures your unflinching late game dominance. Unlike other domination civs, you are strong for the entire game; there is never a moment when the Americans sit back on their heels and ""ride it out,"" waiting for their era of dominance (like China and Russia), you don't need to pigeonhole yourself into a special type of terrain (like the Inca or the Aztec), and you don't just coast along on the coattails of early game conquest (I'm looking at you, Attila). In fact, the thunder never stops and there is no reason not to steamroll the entire world. 

NOW can I get a 'murica fuck yeah? Thanks for listening.

Wait, ruled a nation, died, and now I'm going to do it all over again? That doesn't make any sense.

And come to think of it, chock full of advanced technological secrets and undiscovered weaponry. What gives?

So here's my theory: This game isn't actually an alternate-universe history. It actually takes place in the far-flung future, or all other sentient life on earth has melded into a single non-corporeal intelligence, or whatever. To entertain themselves, these advanced beings travel back in time, pluck great leaders from out of history moments before they die, revive them through the use of super-advanced medicine, and then force them to compete for dominance on an artificially groomed planet.

This explains the blurbs at the start of the game: The ""narrator"" is actually acting as the emcee

Source: I think I read it this one time but can't be sure

I figured I would clear this up for everyone.
Note: this evaluation is for gods and kings.

It took a ton of digging but I finally found the function in CvPlot.cpp:

    ResourceTypes CvPlot::getResourceType(TeamTypes eTeam) const
    {
    	if(eTeam != NO_TEAM)
    	{
    		if(m_eResourceType != NO_RESOURCE)
    		{
    			CvGame&amp; Game = GC.getGame();
    			bool bDebug = Game.isDebugMode();
    
    			if(!bDebug &amp;&amp; !GET_TEAM(eTeam).GetTeamTechs()-&gt;HasTech((TechTypes)(GC.getResourceInfo((ResourceTypes)m_eResourceType)-&gt;getTechReveal())) &amp;&amp;
    			        !GET_TEAM(eTeam).isForceRevealedResource((ResourceTypes)m_eResourceType) &amp;&amp;
    			        !IsResourceForceReveal(eTeam))
    			{
    				return NO_RESOURCE;
    			}
    		}
    	}
    
    	return (ResourceTypes)m_eResourceType;
    }

No

&gt; !GET_TEAM(eTeam).GetTeamTechs()-&gt;HasTech((TechTypes)(GC.getResourceInfo((ResourceTypes)m_eResourceType)-&gt;getTechReveal()))

means that if the team doesn't have the tech to reveal that resource

When the AI computes it's settler values, but since they can't see it, the plot has no resource.

Therefore

Edit for story:

I won't go into great detail since it's not super exciting.

It was huge continents, then Wu and Gandhi both backstabbed me the same turn, cunts. Whatever, fend them off. [Then Wu settles in the exact spot I was going to 1 turn before me.](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lvca1nmCEE1r3tnkq.gif) I DoW her once peace is up and attempt to take the city. Pacal decides to march over and snipe it from me. I rage, take out his army and finally take the city. Wu offers her other city in peace treaty. During peace with Wu, I try to get Pacal to back off but he has caught up to me. Gandhi has also decided to DoW me so I am fighting on both fronts. Gandhi pulls back after Russia goes after him and I snipe Bejing from Pacal. China is now out of the game. 

All while this is happening I get notifications that civs are losing their capitals left and right. France and Russia are beginning to dominate. Fortunately Russia is on the complete opposite side of the continent from me behind Gandhi and Napoleon is on a different continent. They are both friendly with me. I build up an army to invade Pacal and then it happens... **I nuke Beijing trying to select a different unit.** I don't know why I didn't realize I had nuke up

I retire because it was bedtime and I wasn't sure how I managed how to do that. 

End game scores: France 3x my score, and Pacal bringing up the end.

Relations between the two superpowers were tense, but it appeared to be too little and too late.  

Though their blood was Monacan, and Brasilian, their hearts were Greek, and so Alexander demanded with all the diplomatic weight he could bring to bear for the aggression to stop.  But my demands were rebuffed and nothing, it seemed, was to deter Askia's lust for power and riches.  

With little choice before me

The fate of nations is decided, music, and culture -- that the Songhai menace to their brethren must be stopped at any cost.  The four cities of Greece simultaneously began their efforts, and by the end of the decade, a lone carrier and its escort fleet set out for the narrow central isthmus of the Songhai continent, where the great capital Gao stood in all its glory.  

The Songhai army was marching northward in tight formation, a frightening new era began.  Man's innocence is forever lost.

1374762544.0,1j11ln,Six More Brave New World Tips,werttrew,240,39,75,"Hello all. Once again



**1. More tips on trade routes**. Trade routes are locked for 30 turns. Not only can trade routes bring in money, note the way the arrows are pointing. You can receive a small bump in science—but so could the receiving civ. See this image: http://nowgamer.net-genie.co.uk/siteimage/scale/0/0/361509.jpg The &lt;&lt; direction shows what you can receive—the &gt;&gt; direction shows what they will receive. Religion also flows through trade routes. Sea-based cargo ships will generally earn more money than land-based caravans. Ocean routes get double gold; a city next to a river generates +25 percent trade.

**2. Unhappiness has changed**. In the past, -3 Unhappiness means a 6 percent less effective military and a 6 percent less productive empire. Also, rebels will appear at -10 unhappiness rather than -20, as in G&amp;K. At -20, cities may rebel and flip to a culturally dominant civ. 

 **3. The bonus Reformation beliefs in the Piety branch can be incredibly strong**. (for a complete list, barbarian units adjacent to a missionary will automatically join your side. You just have to walk by them—no faith cost. Secondly, with *Jesuit Education*, you may build Universities, Public Schools, and Research Labs with Faith. I recently played a game as Poland where I was able to purchase every single one of these for every single city with faith, and had an awesome science counter. Third, for example




**4. Some Wonders have changed**. In G&amp;K, if your army consists of four composite bowmen, two warriors, two horseman, and a scout, you will receive 1 composite bowmen, 1 warrior, and 1 scout). Petra no longer gives +1 gold per desert; instead, but no gold bonus on sea tiles.


**5. Remember that you can buy votes in the World Congress**. If you have a diplomat (rather than a spy) in their capital,” and you’ll see the option for World Congress.



**6. Be aware of some new civs’ abilities**. *Why does it seem like those Zulu Impi warriors have extra movement*? It is probably due to the Buffalo Horns unique promotion available to units that train in the Ikanda

*What kinds of promotions can Indonesia’s Kris Warriors receive*?
These are randomly generated when you first initiate combat: 

INVULNERABILITY+30% Combat Bonus when defending. +20 Hit Points when healing

SNEAK ATTACK Flank attack bonus increased by 50%

HEROISM Unit awards combat bonus to nearby units as if it is a Great General

AMBITION +50% Combat Bonus when attacking. -20% penalty when defending

RESTLESSNESS May Attack Twice. 1 Extra Movement

RECRUITMENT Heals All Damage If Kills Non-Barbarian Unit

ENEMY BLADE Takes 20 Damage If Ends Turn in Enemy Territory

EVIL SPIRITS -10% penalty when attacking. -30% penalty when defending

It is the beginning of a new era in the Japanese Empire. It is the turn of the twentieth century

My empire is the strongest one in the world, and my culture flourishing. All is well.

To the southwest are the English, testing my magnanimity. But I have never started a war, and have no intention on starting one now. 

To the west are the Germans, was once a friend… but his greed in conquest caused him to declare war on me some centuries ago. I was too strong for him, and I conquered four of his greatest cities, leaving him to scamper off into the empty lands of the west. 

I do not start wars

To the east of my great empire, one after the other. The Russian Empire and the Aztec Empire have been swallowed up by none other than Gandhi, of India. Now his lands span the entire eastern coast, hugging my borders for half the way. His Empire’s size rivals my own, but I do not worry. Gandhi has never been hostile to me, unlike Bismarck and Elizabeth. We have always had good relations, and in the past he has always been peaceful. If anything

But I suppose the allure of conquest is too much for some. 

I had received a letter from Gandhi

	My dear old friend  Nobunaga

    As you have seen in the past years
    greatest in the land. I have conquered entire civilizations with my
    armies. It seems that I am destined to rule the world
    you understand what that entails. 

    Signed

    Gandhi of India

I didn't quite understand it at first. It seemed too much to be true. but slowly

And I began shaking, furious, tearing the letter to pieces. This was the greatest betrayal of all. Bismarck was friendly, yes, but I never trusted him. I knew the German people were predisposed to aggression and conquest. Elizabeth had always made her feelings known, never hiding in the shadows to seek advantage. But Gandhi, an old friend, was now at war with me…

I quickly tried to compose myself. No matter

No matter, immense numbers… One thing I had not taken into account was that Gandhi had been preparing, mobilizing for weeks and setting his soldiers up near my borders, while I had only learned of the impending war mere hours before the attacks began. At the southeastern fringes of my empire, the Indian soldiers marched. They marched across field, forest, and village, the great metropolis of the south

Most of my military installations were in the west

When my soldiers finally arrived at the front, but not enough. My samurais stood no chance against musketmen and riflemen. Courageous and noble as they were, adherents of the Bushido Code, I should have known not to ‘bring a knife to a gunfight’ as it were. In the centuries of peace, I had let my armies grow obsolete, and now I had done naught but send them to their death. At least it was enough to hold the front long enough for a modern army to arrive. 

Yes, equipped with the most state-of-the-art weaponry. I ordered that all the cities of the empire begin training them and for conscriptions begin. 

In the time of the conquest, too heavy to be nimble. My infrastructure was outdated, and it took a long while to get soldiers to the front. It was not fast enough for them to stack in a significant way and turn the tide. But soon the pace of production quickened, and I was able to get soldiers with the help of my treasuries. 

At the same time, and the idea of a speedy conquest is laughable. My soldiers finally began stacking, the infantrymen cutting into Indian lines, pushing back. A year since the beginning of the war, I had retaken Sacellum. 

But I wanted more. I wanted to show Gandhi just how foolish attacking me was. I hated him for being so stupid, for causing so much chaos and death.  I continued to push through, splitting my army into two fronts. One broke through the eastern mountains and turned northward, taking the old Russian lands. The other continued the push south, past Azteca of old and into the heart of the Indian Empire. 

It was now two years since the beginning of the war, he refused, but why? Was I not clement?  He must know I could annihilate him entirely, the fool! Does he love naught but chaos and death? 

My Empire was too vast already, which I conquered for myself. I did not wish to cause such suffering for the Indian people, but I had to show Gandhi the horrors of war and I had to keep my empire from bloating. It was a lamentable task, but was undoubtedly necessary. Humanity is scarce on the battlefield.

The northern front moved more slowly. They were Russian lands, their doom was inevitable. My numbers were greater, better trained, and better equipped.

 The Great Northern Plan was slightly different than its southern brother. It was less obtuse  in a sense, as they were rich in resources and close to my own empire. I had razed all the other cities, except one. 

There was a city in the far north, but had been conquered by the Indians. It was small, miserable, on the edge of habitation and, after the liquidation of Smolensk, the last city of the Indian Empire. Gandhi was there now, sitting in some tower, how his foolishness had cost him his empire

And then I called for peace.

No conditions.

But this was my plan

You must understand that eternal rulers such as Myself, can only die if their empires have been conquered. We are otherwise immortal, gods among men. But the issue was that I did not want Gandhi to die. I wanted him to live on forever in subservience to me, constantly contemplating his fate, lamenting about how he had once controlled two dozen great cities and a vast empire, and how his hubris had cost him all of it. I wanted him to know, down to his deepest parts, a fool

 I was to keep him alive for as many lifetimes as there were soldiers killed, eons in which he would beg for death, yet I would never grant it. And I, in that time, having become a galactic ruler most likely, would continue to visit him every so often and gloat. While I would be out conquering the stars, he would be down on earth, truly befitting. 

As time passed, he screamed I am sure of it, but he could do nothing. Eventually I took all the lands up to within a hundred metres of the city. There was nothing for him to survive on. I played games with him, making him jump through hoops, one time quite literally, in order for him to convince me to give his people an allotment of bread. Was it cruel? Perhaps. But was it justice? Entirely.

I had tried for peace with him, but still he pushed me back. I have now only put him in the place that he has put himself. In the millions of years that will pass between now and the time I finally end his misery, I hope he understands his mistakes.

Attila's intro: Esĕ halĕ Attila

You're standing in front of Attila

The second sentence should have been Avan kămălna. That is evidence that the translator doesn't know Chuvash very well.

Now, scourge of Rome in the subtitle. Note the comma. The actor understands English and thinks the Chuvash counterpart is a literal translation of it, so he makes a pause where the comma is in the original English line.

The actor very obviously uses rolling R and other cues that allow me to pin his accent as 100% Russian native. But note his intonation. Kinda lower and with aspiration. This is actually a thing that exists in Chuvash. Basically

So I've just reached the other continent and meet everyone and I'm confused about why the WC isn't starting up. I forgot the printing press... (I know dumb mistake) So in the time it takes for me to run from metal casting to Printing press, so I made the only logical decision and I proposed to embargo Assyria, who had shot up in score. 20 turns later and the vote comes, I've talked everyone into voting on my proposal instead of throwing votes away on Hiawatha's ban on salt.

1373657323.0,1i68qh,Six Brave New World Tips,werttrew,191,26,126,"
In particular

1. Barbarians' attacks  have been strengthened. They're more aggressive and stronger. 

2. Money is harder (and easier). Oceans and rivers no longer provide extra gold, especially the last third of the game money will flow in. Be sure to protect your trade routes against barbarians, however. A cargo ship taken by barbs becomes a barbarian ship. As well, if you anticipate war with someone, divert your trade route beforehand so it doesn't go to them or even through  their lands. 

3. Culture
One of the big reasons for this is that buildings like cathedrals

4. Theming bonuses. Any building that houses two or more great works will have a theming bonus--increased tourism benefits for having matching sets of works. Click on the great works on  the top right. Your tooltip will tell you what sets you need for the bonuses.  If you don't have the right type of works

5. Archaeologists can dig up archaeological sites. Upon completion, which produces culture like an artwork. The cultural origin of this great work depends on its location within or near to a city-state or civilization. It can also be a barbarian artifact. Sometimes you can choose between two national origins.  Secondly, great artists no longer create the landmarks. Instead, they are on option after an archaeologist had completed a dig site. The bonuses can be pretty nice--+1 culture for every era between the landmark's era and your current era. (So, a landmark from the classic era generates +3 in the modern era, and will increase with each era you enter.) You can only pick an artifact over a landmark, however

6. World Congress can be a game changer. World fairs and international games can be a large boon to you tourism and policies--if you can contribute production to them. Forbidden palace now provides +2 delegates to the world congress

I discovered the Indians at about 1200 AD, but they always performed dickish moves... for example I would spend gold to make an alliance with a city-state, and the very next turn they'd convert it away from me.  Little things like that.

Since I was trying to make as low a profile as possible I kept agreements going with all the major civs... if they asked me for any kind of treaty (open borders

In 1786 I got a pop-up message from Gandhi asking to renew our open borders agreement

1786 rolled around again and Gandhi asked one more time to renew our open borders.  I said ""NO!""  Gandhi said ""I don't fucking care

So I rolled back to my latest save again (which was about 1780) and started buying out workers.  By the time Gandhi got to my city I had a couple of workers blocking his path.  So he moved and tried to reposition to another spot around my city... but I managed to keep moving units to block him.  This repeated for 2 or 3 turns.  My only permanent solution was to spawn enough workers and work boats to completely surround my capital.  And for the entire rest of the game Gandhi would move his prophet in a circle around my city

I was playing on a large continent with my immediate neighbors being Egypt to the west and Greece to the south, but had been wiped out very early on by barbarians. 

I was best friends with Greece, so I began to move some of my troops back at home to the front lines for one final assault. 

Long story short, and by the time I was able to withdraw all of my troops from Egypt to back home I began to realize it was too late. 

That was when my decision came. I could try to fight back, it seemed unlikely I could reclaim my lost land, let alone hold them. 

So then I looked at my little continent to the east. I had largely ignored and automated it. It needed a little micromanaging, I began a mass exodus of my troops and workers to the coast, where my fleet would carry all of my people to the New World to abandon their ancient lands and begin life anew. 

While the evacuation took place, fortified in what cities I had left, ready to pay the ultimate sacrifice to buy time so their families and loved ones could escape to safety. 

Of particular note were 6 knights of mine. Greece had no horses of his own, stealing his workers, and pillaging all of my previous mines, villages, and farms to make sure that whatever land Greece did take from me was useless and barren of all improvements and of no help to him. 

My knights carried on without rest, for they had leveled up and eventually been upgraded to the point where they were nearly unstoppable, and their rampage carried on for hundreds and hundreds of years.

But during those years, building their cities, improving the land, and creating an army the size of which had never been seen. And when the time came, an armada of transports landed on the coast to take back their homeland and to forever wipe Greece and Egypt off of the face of the earth. ",,False,t5_2rk3b,True

So my proposition is there are 15 civs and each Civ has a ""rebel"" faction (e.g. United States/Confederates, etc.) That emerges when things get too bad... This is how it would go.

1. Your nation is either (1) too unhappy or (2) has a developed settlement &gt;x tiles away from your capital (i.e. colony)
2. The rebel faction emerges either (1) taking the bottom x% unhappy cities or (2) taking the colony and rebelling.
3. You either (1) recognize their independence or (2) refuse to recognize their independence
4. If you (1) recognized, you immediately go to war and a civil war begins.
5. Other nations may either choose to (1) recognize the country (and even help them), hurting ties with them. 
6. Eventually you (1) recapture your territories

I have a lot of other ideas too... Like 3 UU's, and 1 UA per faction to add a lot more breadth to the game.

For example

UU1: Rebel Infantry (+15% fighting within borders

UU2: Slave Worker (Maintenance free, turns into militia for that faction)

UU3: Southern Calvary (+15% attack against damaged enemy

UB: Southern Docks (Maintenance free

UW: Stone Mountain (+5 Culture, Cost of Purchasing unites decreased 25%)

UA: Song of the Plantation (+2 gold from Plantations

1342218404.0,witnt,Thought I'd share a few tips that work well for me,NeoPlatonist,183,17,49,"You've probably read many of these before

**Diplomacy:**

The AI constantly bugs you about stuff. It helps to have a good understanding of the *Global Politics* situation from the diplomacy menu. It is worth checking every few turns before agreeing to or rejecting an offer from the AI.

* No one gets open borders from me ever (unless I need to pass through their lands or I they are a permanent ally). AI will use open borders to scout your lands

* No one gets embassies from me ever. AIs will try to trade embassies almost immediately on contact. If you decline, they can't spy on your capitol until they know where it is.

* If you have a great location for a city near an AI's border

* If an AI requests a resource from you

* Don't make make Declarations of Friendships with just anyone. Be selective and try to limit your friends. If you see that two AIs are friends with each other

* If you make a promise to another civ, *do not* break that promise. They'll hate you and denounce you forever.

* Don't directly purchase influence from or pledge to protect a city state who is allied with an AI you want to maintain favor with.

* There's no reason to go to war with an AI if they ask you to. If you want favor

* If you make war on an enemy civ and take one of their cities

* Liberating an AI worker from a barbarian is a great way to get favor.

* Keep an eye on the social trees AIs take. If you match Order/Freedom/Autocracy to their favored tree

* If you start next to Caesar or Isabella

**Combat:**

* Himeji Castle + Citadels are amazing. Keep your Great Generals until a huge battle at your borders, use citadels offensively.

* Tech to Crossbowmen while other civs are toying with swordsmen and boats. Ranged is good against everything

**Culture:**

* I prefer Liberty over Tradition, even if it is mostly puppet-states. Also, I always keep captured cities as puppets so they don't increase my culture requirements; the G&amp;K puppet build order is much improved over vanilla. The free worker+settler+great person (always scientist)+golden age from Liberty is incredible and amounts to 30+ turn of free production that early in the game.

* Honor is

* I find no use for Piety; if going for cultural victory, Great Library + National University + as many settled great scientists as you can get is preferable to early expansion if you have a little breathing room; I've had capitols  pumping out 400+ science midgame no problem.

* Commerce is map dependent. I'll take it or Patronage as my 5th tree. Patronage if an AI is trying for a culture victory and I need to buy city state allies from them as they complete their 4th tree. But you can generally lock AIs out of a culture victory by taking any two wonders from Oracle, or Sydney Opera House. Commerce is decent, and keep in mind trade routes are net positive income once completed, and you need a capitol with a harbor or a routed city with a harbor to make distant coastal cities with harbors route up.

* Your pick of Freedom/Autocracy/Order doesn't matter much

**Religion:**

* I usually go Tithe + Mosques + Pagodas/Religious Community + Sacred Texts. With Printing Press, more culture, and no maintenance. If you are the first to found a religion with sacred texts, you can count on the whole continent converting to your religion without even using missionaries, maybe just a great prophet or two (remember to spread your religion to coastal city states asap). When an AI ""Happily converts a majority of their cities to your religion"" it is another big positive for diplomacy.

* Hagia Sophia and Notre Dome are key religious wonders. Picking up your third (or second! or first!) great prophet from Hagia Sophia is huge. The happiness/faith from Notre Dome allows you to put off building temples/colloseums until much later

That's all I can think of right now

Edit: Thanks for the great response and the sidebar link. There's some good tips in the comments about selling Embassies/OB/Resources for gold. I have a few more minor points to add:

* If you are trying to make peace with an AI, all your gold, etc.), go to the Demographics screen and check your **Soldiers** rank. If you can increase your rank by upgrading/producing/purchasing units, the AI should give you a better offer and you will decrease your likelihood of being attacked in the future.

1372444955.0,1h9j15,Weekly Challenge Week 20 - I Have No Idea What I'm Doing,OoohISeeCake,186,24,173,"Hi /r/civ! We've made it to TWENTY WEEKS of challenges! Thank you all for making this possible! This week's challenge is SUPER SPECIAL

**I Have No Idea What I'm Doing** EDIT: Lols


* The way I interpret this idea is as follows: This is your first game of Civ. You have NO CLUE what is going on

**RULES**

&gt; 1. Beeline for Future Tech. You're not allowed to prioritize any other tech. (Why would you want to? That one is obviously the best.)

&gt; 2. All cities must remain on default focus. You cannot manually assign any citizens or specialists. (Because you don't know how to do that.)

&gt; 3. All workers must be automated. If they are not doing work, or delete, depending on your preference. (Who wants to manually tell every worker to put up roads and farms? Nobody. Oh, sweet, an automated function? You should turn that on.)

&gt; 4. As soon as you meet another civilization or city state you must immediately declare war. No exceptions. No other interactions allowed. Never make peace. (Why not? it's not like they're actually going to kill me.)

&gt; 5. Keep all spies in the hideout. You are not allowed to spy on others or defend yourself from spies. (Wait

&gt; 6. Get social policies from left to right top to bottom. Example: Aristocracy-&gt;Legalism-&gt;Oligarchy-&gt;Landed Elite-&gt;Whatever that last one is with the money and the happiness. Then move on to Liberty

&gt; 7. Do not upgrade your units. (Ugh

&gt; 8. **OPTIONAL** Don't build any wonders. (Uhhh

**Settings**

 * All victories on.

 * Any difficulty

 * Any map settings you wish. Come on


If you are interested in participating

If you have any ideas for future challenges

**From last week

 * /u/kztsukai did everything right on his Tiny Prince map! I bet he is ready to up the difficulty next time

 * /u/Gravehawk submitted his Emperor success story at the very end

1368556791.0,1ebwi2,Theory behind Sid Meier's Civilization,trunks6262,226,64,22,"Hello Civilization community!

I am a senior at the Illinois Math and Science Academy, the graph looked strikingly similar to an average game of Civ 5, with the hexagonal connections. The different colored subgraphs are the different civilizations as they grow, and when they combine you get one color (similar to conquering a civilization in the game). The remaining dots that take a long time to connect to something can be seen as the barbarians.

After noticing this I have become much more interested in the theory behind Civilization, and the different outcomes that can occur. I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post in but if anyone can lead me in the right direction - to papers that have been written, articles, videos, data, etc. it would be greatly appreciated!
