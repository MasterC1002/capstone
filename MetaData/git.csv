**git-ws**

`git-ws` is a command line utility designed to help working with multiple git repositories at once. It's currently intended for personal use only

Using `git-ws` in a folder calls git commands (and shell commands) in all folders which are git repositories.

---

**Most useful commands**

* `git-ws ?`: displays auto-generated help for all commands
* `git-ws ? 'cmd name'`: displays auto-generated help for a command
* `git-ws query`: displays all repos detected by git-ws
* `git-ws push`: push staged changes
* `git-ws push -a`: push staged changes
* `git-ws pull`: pull latest version
* `git-ws pull -s`: pull latest version
* `git-ws status`: displays short git status
* `git-ws submodule au`: stashes local submodules, and pushes
* `git-ws do 'cmd here'`: runs a subshell in every repo
* `git-ws do -c 'cmd here'`: runs a subshell in every repo with changes
* `git-ws do -a 'cmd here'`: runs a subshell in every ahead repo

---

**Why is this useful?**

Real-life situation: I'm working on my game, etc).
I create a `OHWorkspace` folder

* `mkdir OHWorkspace; cd OHWorkspace`
* `git clone https://.../SSVUtils`
* `git clone https://.../SSVUtilsJson`
* `git clone https://.../SSVStart`
* `git clone https://.../&lt;etc&gt;`
* `git clone https://.../SSVOpenHexagon`

Now my directory tree looks like this:

     
    OHWorkspace/
        	...
        	SSVUtils/
        		.git/
        		...
        	SSVUtilsJson/
        		.git/
        		...
        	SSVStart/
        		.git/
        		...
        	SSVOpenHexagon/
        		.git/
        		...
    
    
I work on all the repos simultaneously. I constantly need to check what repos I've modified.

* `cd OHWorkspace/; git-ws st` (st == status)
* returns a human-readable list of changes

After I review changes

* `git-ws do -c 'gitg'` (this opens gitg in every repo with changes to commit) 

After I use gitg to make my commits:

* `git-ws push -a; git-ws sub au` (all staged commits in ahead repos are pushed to GitHub - then, and pushed, so that the online and local submodules are up-to-date)",,False,,t5_2qhv1,,http://www.reddit.com/r/git/comments/1haxm0/gitws_a_commandline_utility_im_working_on_any/

I'm hoping for some advice related to the git workflow we're currently using at work.  Here's the current process:

1. ""git pull"" - This should be done on the master branch.
2. ""git checkout -b TASK-ID"" - Create a new branch for the task.  TASK-ID would be something like ""PEGAS-101""
3. Work on the task and commit changes as needed.
4. When done with the task
5. ""git pull"" - Get any changes that have been made since the last pull.
6. Resolve any conflicts and ensure the current version in the master compiles.
7. Checkout the branch you have been working in: ""git checkout TASK-ID""
8. Merge in the changes from the master: ""git merge master""
9. Resolve any conflicts and commit the changes.
10. Check out the master again.
11. ""git merge --squash TASK-ID"" - This treats all of the commits in the branch as one commit when merging.
12. ""git commit"" - Add any additional information
13. ""git push"" - Push the changes back to the server.

This has worked out well for us so far

* All changes go to the master and you cherry-pick the fixes you need.  This is O.K., that we may not even have that issue that needs fixed.  Or, the code has changed enough that to make it work we need to make significant changes to the production version.
* We have a single release branch that hold all of the tags to all of the different versions we have.  The question becomes
* We have one branch per release and fixes in one branch get merged/cherry picked into the other branches if possible.  This seems to be the most reasonable as we can update individual versions as needed

What are your thoughts?  Please keep in mind that I'm not git expert yet, I figured it's best to ask here in case there are any technical issues/constraints that are git-specific that may affect what we're trying to do.

Searches of the interwebs aren't being terribly helpful thus far; Most seem to just be set up guides for and initial install/setup Gerrit on a bare server.  Are there any other options I am missing?

I share it because I've been finding it useful for ad-hoc notations on branches.  I don't get bothered by extremely long branch names because I have another alias / utility that lets me switch branches using a simple `dialog` / GUI script so I'm never typing the full branch names anyway.

Another approach that has been suggested is to use **git-submodule** and have the shared code in a separate repo that is added to the other repos as a submodule. However

I've also looked into [**git-stitch-repo**](https://metacpan.org/module/git-stitch-repo) for combining repos.

    git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always

After almost five years of using git

* I'm now thinking of all branches as tracking branches. Some local branches track remote branches. Other local branches track `master` or other local branches. But everything's tracking something. It's symmetrical--we do the same thing from git's point of view when we push to a remote and when we merge into local master. They can both be done with push.

* The workflow is symmetrical. It's always `git pull` (to rebase) followed by `git push` (to push by fast-forward merge). No need to checkout master

* I can always fall back on `git fetch` and `git merge` if something smells fishy.

* Topic branches are short-lived (by definition). I don't care about retaining a branchy history with them because there's no useful information I can extract from the branchy history. And

* I can always set up specific branches to _not_ rebase with `git config branch.&lt;name&gt;.rebase false`.

Hopefully this should eliminate quite a bit of checkout and merge command typing ... not to mention untangling messy branch histories.",,t5_2qhv1,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/git/comments/1du9s7/took_a_deep_breath_and_set/

Hi everyone

My goal is to set up a GIT server so that other devs in the organization can collaborate on projects; I should start by saying that we can't use Github because of red tape and a stubborn contracts office but the good new is we have all the resources we need to set everything up internally.

We typically use centOS for everything server related and almost all of our dev's are windows users. 

This is more of a configuration/structure question than a *How do I use GIT?* question

**Questions:**

1. Does anyone have any tips for configuring an Git server using centOS. Shoud I use SAMBA or something so the repos are directly accessible from remote clients?
1. How should I organize my directories, I have a directory on my computer with a few repos in it for separate projects; in theory I might be collaborating with completely different people on all of them but, right now, it's just local and I'm the only one making commits.
1. Are there any questions that I need to be asking that I'm not?

I think I understand the solutions the author talks about. I mostly just don't understand some parts about the problems he explains. I think in order for me to fully undertand the solutions

1. There is a paragraph about *blame*. I don't understand the problem the author is illustrating and how he came to the conclusion that he did about *blame* not working in the way you would expect it to in the given scenario.

2. The author says that there are two reasons why revision control exists: (1) to help the act of writing code (syncing changes and backing up) and (2) configuration management (managing parallel lines of development, these two reasons conflict. I don't understand how they conflict.

3. I don't understand the last sentence of this paragraph: ""Feature branches seem like a happy middle ground. They solve the basic problems of parallel development. You’re thinking of integration at the least important time

    $ git branch
      * (no branch)
      master

And apparently I was on the ""no branch"" branch. I was trying to merge my changes but got:

    $ git merge master
    Already up-to-date.

Which was strange so I did a pull:

    $ git pull
    Username: 
    Password: 
    You are not currently on a branch
    'branch.&lt;branchname&gt;.merge' in your configuration file.
    Please specify which branch you want to merge with on the command
    line and try again (e.g. 'git pull &lt;repository&gt; &lt;refspec&gt;').
    See git-pull(1) for details.

Which lead me to do:

    $ git pull origin master
    Username: 
    Password: 
    From https://github.com/xxx/xxx
    * branch            master     -&gt; FETCH_HEAD
    Already up-to-date.

So I thought

    $ git push
    Username: 
    Password: 
    Everything up-to-date

I then concluded that the merge might have been successful and so I decided to switch to the master branch to check it out - I think this is where I made my fatal mistake:

    $ git branch master
    fatal: A branch named 'master' already exists.

And of course

    $ git branch
    * master

Did I just destroy an entire days worth of work? Or is there a way to get back?

I'll explain my goal: I have two Mac laptops that I do most of my web development on. What I'd like to be able to do is code on one laptop, if I have the one Mac laptop doing something else, I can always go on the other Mac laptop, pull the latest changes down, continue coding, commit, and push the changes back to the Windows computer.

I tried [GitStack](http://gitstack.com/)

**EDIT**: After reading these comments

Consider the following scenario:

* My Windows Vista computer has a network share called ""Git"". Currently
* One of my Mac laptops has an existing project called ""awesome-project"". It is *not* currently a Git repository; it's just a normal folder.
* I want to push the project onto the Windows Vista computer and then pull it down on my other Mac laptop.
* The ""Git"" share has been mounted on both Mac laptops.

Commands to run on the first Mac laptop:

    mkdir /Volumes/Git/awesome-project/
    git init --bare !$
    cd /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/awesome-project/
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m ""Initial commit""

I would like to see if we are using this correctly for our situation.,kassanu,9,0,12,"My friend and I are working on a project for class and we decided to use git to get into good habits with version control.  He is totally new to version control and I have used git on my own for a personal project but nothing too serious.  We set up a repo on GitHub and we are using the GitHub for Windows Program (http://windows.github.com/) for managing our repos.    
  
We both cloned the repository that was on GitHub and began working on our files(both on the master branch) but when it came time to commit and sync our code it got really messed up.  I committed first and synced fine to the repo on GitHub.  When he went to commit his changes it failed to commit and said something about a detached head and there were problems merging files to the master branch(The GitHub program showed that he had a branch called DETACHEDHEAD).  We ended up having to destroy his repo and transfer his files to my computer and manually merge everything so I could commit them to GitHub myself.
  
I don't really understand what had happened.  Was it a problem that we were working on the same branch and made changes to the same files?  I have never used git with multiple people so I'm unsure if we can edit the same files and then sync them or if we would have to create our own branches and merge them onto the master branch.  Could anyone explain what happened when I committed and synced my local repository to GitHub and after when he tried to do the same git created a detached head and said there were errors with our repository that had to be debugged?
  
Sorry I don't have the actual errors this happened earlier in the day and I've been trying to figure this out on my own for the past couple of hours.  If anyone needs more information about our setup I can provide any info.  Thank you!

1346254983.0,z0vtq,How can I get a more readable (albeit inaccurate) diff output?,0sse,9,1,12,"The other day I was reindenting a shell script to replace eight-space indents
with four-space indents. I decided to do this is one commit since it was one
logical change to a file in the repository. When looking at the output of `git
diff` I noticed something interesting.
[""Pictures""](https://gist.github.com/3497287) say more than a thousand words.

Notice that git says line no. 16 is unchanged
flow of the script it is (logically speaking) actually two different lines.
Because of changes in indentation the second-level `then` line now looks
exactly like the first-level one previously did. An equivalent situation arises
with the `fi` line on line 23.

Technically speaking the diff is correct and I have no problem with it. But in
my opinion it would be much easier for a human to see what is going on in the
diff if `git diff` would *show* these several diff hunks as one larger one
pretend as if the single context lines in between were part of the diff
itself. 

I already know about the `-w` and `-b` arguments to `git diff` that ignore
changes in whitespace. But in this case the change in whitespace is the whole
point of the commit! After some digging I found the flag `--inter-hunk-context`
which according to the man page seems to be *exactly* what I want
doesn't seem to make a difference no matter if I do `--inter-hunk-context=1` or
`0` or `10`

Does anyone know how I can achieve what I want? Have I completely misunderstood
the `--inter-hunk-context` option? Have I gone off the rails for wanting a
feature like this?

Local Environment



2 developers working on website

1 - Mac user

1 - Windows user



Development server located locally in office - 192.168.9.10 (dev)



Development server is a WAMP installation - C:\wamp\



**Global codebase**

c:\wamp\global\application

c:\wamp\global\system

c:\wamp\global\ipbwi

 

**Global assets**

c:\wamp\www\assets\



**Individual site**

c:\wamp\www\assets\



Currently the code is edited on the development server and all testing is done by accessing the shared server through 192.168.9.10 address. The servers wamp directory is shared to us using simple windows network share with permissions set to allow only us to write to it. The network share is then loaded into our editors (SublimeText/Textmate) and we work on a file



If one of us write a line which breaks the site, issues occur. 



When we manage to get the development server to a level where we're ready to push to the remote live site



Slight improvements have been made recently so that instead of pushing code which goes to all websites



I want to improve this setup with Git



Local development server

- Should be a 'bare' repository

- Needs to have a 'working directory' added to it pointing to the c:\wamp\www\ folder. Not doing this would mean the server would return no view as technically it would have no files on it. 

- Would be our 'origin'

- 2 branches



Each developer 

- Needs to have a local repository on their machine and an appropriate WAMP/LAMP installation



This is as far as I can seem to understand it. I'm not really sure which branch should be checked out on the dev server master/dev. I don't understand if we all locally have the same master/dev branches



I also presume the git repo can sit in c:\wamp\ and be told to ignore everything (using gitignore) except \global\ and \www\ so that it will only monitor



c:\wamp\global\

c:\wamp\www\

and ignore

c:\wamp\bin etc...



I know theres not really a direct question in this but can somebody tell me if I look to be along the right lines and explain the workflow for each day in terms of what is checked out where

Hi

I'm learning the language Go at the moment. Go allows you to import packages from git repos by writing the command: 

    go get github.com/name/repo

This basically translates into a git clone command.

When I run the go command

    package github.com/someone/web: exec: ""git"": executable file not found in $PATH 

After looking around the web for an answer, but I'm wary of doing that without knowing the effects it might have.

Note that I'm doing this on a Macbook with OSX Lion. Git version 1.8.2.

I am working with a team of developers and we are working with one main repo. In that repo

We do not want to use the dictator workflow because we cannot rely on just one person to review changes before they are added in to the production branch. We can use git blame if some one adds bad code but we get the ""I've been chewed out before"" reaction. Or because they do not know how to branch. (We have had a number of discussions on this)

I want to introduce a code review system where you can only commit to the main branch when two people have signed-off on the code. This means that two people will be responsible for saying this code is good to go in to production. It also means that two people have looked at the code.

Thoughts?

I finally thought I had it figured out. After loads of pain, I mothballed my old git repo and recloned a new subversion repo.

    git svn clone --prefix=svn/ url://fuck.it -s

Dandy. Now I create a new branch and check said branch out locally

    git svn branch svn/devhub
    git checkout -b local/devhub svn/devhub

Great

    git svn rebase

Oh, moving on:

    git svn dcommit

Stellar, its time to move back into trunk. Someone has since made changes, so I need to get their code merged with mine.

    git rebase local/trunk

Oh, but I keep hearing that that's a huge mistake if I'm planning on committing to svn. So, I spend the next 20 minutes resolving conflicts for bullshit commits that I don't want to even be considered. Ok fine, lets just bail and I heard about this interactive thing.

    git rebase local/trunk -i

Pick, ... , edit. Cool, I'm just going to get everything down to two or three commits, and that'll be great. Wait, why is it still trying to resolve these conflicts for squashed commits. All right, fuck it

Ok, pick my changes and trunk's changes and be done. Instead 3 hours have gone on, and I'm going through every last file manually resolving conflicts.

What gives?

I'm really trying to introduce git to my new company, I'm starting to think that it would just be a lot easier to work in svn because every time I make a change to anything I'm in conflict hell for hours.

I cancel the cp

    git checkout version_2

I'm trying to get the hang of git before my group migrates to it sometime by the end of summer, msysgit, tortoise - and just native git on another linux box).

Here's the scenario I'm trying to work through:

I have a repo on my ""server"" that I am able to clone from anywhere in my network. It's already a git repo because I ran 'git init &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m ""initial commit""' within it. Git works fine from that directory on that box.

Dealing with it as a remote...not so much luck.

So on my client machine I am able to clone the repo successfully. I can see the changes and files. If I add a new file to the repo, I try to push the change back to the server and I get this message:

&gt;refusing to update checked out branch: refs/heads/master
 By default
 is denied
 with what you pushed
 the work tree to HEAD.
 
&gt; You can set 'receive.denyCurrentBranch' configuration variable to
 'ignore' or 'warn' in the remote repository to allow pushing into
 its current branch; however
 arranged to update its work tree to match what you pushed in some
 other way.
 
&gt; To squelch this message and still keep the default behaviour

To ssh://kaosx@haf:/home/kaosx/liquidprompt/
! [remote rejected] master -&gt; master (branch is currently checked out)
error: failed to push some refs to 'ssh://kaosx@haf:/home/myuser/liquidprompt/'


essentially what I want to be able to do is
*clone (I'm used to ""checking out""
*make my changes or add/delete files
*locally commit those changes
*push those changes to the remote system(server)

Can anyone explain what I've done wrong above (I read the description in the error several times to no avail)

1360704339.0,18efmh,Forcing Re-review of submitted patches ,__r99f8f9,6,0,3,"This is a spiritual followup to my earlier post: http://www.reddit.com/r/git/comments/176xpu/nongerrit_code_review_options/


Since it is looking like it is the best option


Starting with a somewhat 'git-flow' type set up, and other branches for features or whatever.
  

What I would like to set up in gerrit is:  
  * Only Leads can push to 'master'  
  * Anything going to 'dev' needs to be reviewed  
  * Sandbox branches generally don't need to be reviewed


At first blush


The problem that I've run into with that configuration is that Gerrit treats anything that makes it to the committed side as ""reviewed"" and it can be fed through the system again with out creating a review request.  So a developer can create a commit, and then push it up to 'dev' without ever having had the code verified or reviewed by another.


Ideally


Anyone have any other suggestions?



1 - Various reasons including but not limited to of:  
  * Encouraging people to use branches for preliminary work and only merging to dev when done  
  * Allowing exploratory work to not require review  
  * Making collaboration on a feature between multiple developers easier  
  * Backing up code to a central server rather then keeping it all local until done  



EDIT:  
It might be doable if I enable pushing merges to dev for review.  So one can work on a branch


EDIT 2:  
This appears to be the same issue: http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=1142  
Need to investigate the patch to see if it should be applied. (ninja edit: Nope... it looks like that is a slightly different issue)

EDIT 3:  
I should have read that bug more closely.  This patch linked looks like it might exactly be the situation I've described.  Too bad it hasn't been updated since Oct  
https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/32881/

Here's an example:

1. I clone a repo.

What am I doing wrong or misunderstanding here?

Hi, and reddit has always been a huge help to me before.

I have a project hosted at GitHub, and the other day I pushed a minor documentation change and got a failing build notification, which was odd since I didn't touch the code. The logs indicated that Travis was unable to clone the repository to even attempt a build. I attempted to make a fresh clone myself, and got this error:

    error: refs/remotes/origin/master does not point to a valid object!
    error: Trying to write ref refs/heads/master with nonexistent object 15dcb6deae4a1850e36a6df8fa66032a35b2d1b0
    fatal: Cannot update the ref 'HEAD'.

I tried to fetch into an out-of date clone on another system and got the same error. I rolled back the commit with a hard reset and forced a push to GitHub (acting on advice from GitHub support). So then I could clone and fetch again, breaks it again.

Deciding to experiment, I deleted my master branch on the broken project at GitHub and pushed my master from the working project into the broken one. Once again, clones from the broken project fail, while the fork works perfectly even though they have identical masters.

Each time

Does anybody have any idea what's going on? I'd like to salvage my broken project

1) I know it's frowned upon to push rebased commits to a branch others are working from. I'm not sure if there's something I'm missing, or bad in some other way I don't see?

It's strange to me to work on a branch and not rebase along the entire time to make sure it works entirely with the very latest master, and the code would effectively just replay on top of the master branch to get rolled back in, creating a single chain of history. If you don't do this, you're hoping that the code all just works once it's merged back in, no? The only reason I like commit bubbles is for seeing a bunch of work as a separated-out branch, but it feels arbitrary, too. The only reason it branches from a particular point is that's when the person started working on it (or it's the last place onto which they rebased). It seems pointless to me to have parallel branches that effectively keep the feature/fix/whatever from knowing about the latest stuff in master (or wherever) until it's all merged together at the end. The commits the branch skips over in master seem skipped over for no reason

3) As I said, say, have 3 people break off and work on a feature together, pulling from each other for a week or two before merging back in to master do this? Is there a branch leader who pulls the original, the others pull from that person, and the leader pulls back from them? This would allow that person to keep rebasing onto master to stay in sync, pulling from others, but it means the others would be out of sync. Does each person rebase onto master at will,,False

We also agreed that we'd split the repository into about 5 new repositories. This could easily be done in a lazy way just by copying directories and files into the new repositories

From what I can tell

1) When I run 'svnadmin dump ./directory &gt; svnrepo.directory.dump' svnadmin provides the error message:
""Can't open file 'directory/format': No such file or directory""
Which begs the question (having never used SVN myself and only being here for a couple weeks and thereby never having to use it) what the hell is the format file? I can't find one anywhere in the repository.

2) Is there a more intelligent way of doing this?

3) If there isn't

pull/push -&gt; fetch/checkout is working okay right now


**Context**

Single project


**Objectives**

* Master is always prod ready/stable

* Workflow is clear to any new dev (who may not know how git)

**Idea**

* Master - singular commit for each version (squash all commits in version branch when version complete)

* Develop - main working branch

* 1.0-wip - version/feature branches

* 1.0-squash - when a version is finished create a squash branch


**Issues**

* Not sure how to deploy rapid hot fixes to prod

* Unsure if the faff of squashing branches into single commits for master would be worthwhile (would look really neat though!)

My problems came when I tried this. Git refused to connect to the box after I set up my keys, I fired up wireshark, and discovered it was trying to connect to the IP listed in my PuTTY config under 'Default settings'; which was different to the git server IP. I tried to work around this by modifying the default config to point to the Git server. This worked, but now I received a 'Fatal: Server unexpectedly closed connection', as well as a pair of malformed packets in wireshark. 

Confused, and reinstalling, making sure to choose 'Use Openssl' this time rather than plink - same again. Git stubbornly refused to try with anything other than plink. I uninstalled PuTTY entirely, then Git, then reinstalled Git (this time i got no option as to what ssh to use, I asssume it checks for PuTTY during install) - same result.

In frustration

GIT_SSH=C:\Program Files\PuTTY\plink.exe

Argh. Modified this to point to ssh.exe

Now that the long windedness is done with, and this was a remnant from my initial attempt using plink? I made an attempt at scrubbing my system between installs to try and avoid this, but I'm curious if there was a step that was missed.

This leads to my question: “Can Git

To my knowledge there are many differences in how you handle software and hardware data in software configuration management (SCM) and product data management (PDM) respectively. This relates to the fundamental difference data representation in these two systems.

• PDM manages objects

PDM uses an object oriented data model where data is represented via a business item connected to a data item

The data representation in SCM is more or less a file system with directories and files. Anything represented as a file or directory may be managed and stored in SCM (all kind of file types and objects). The metadata is stored together with the file itself and not in a separate database

Let's say I have a tool branch, but making it generic so that it can be used for other things one day.

So, I want to test it with the proprietary data, so I switch to the proprietary test branch, merge in the tool branch, do my tests, and all is well. Eventually, maybe a few hours later I've done this a couple of times, however, this orphans the test branch

It seems like it would be possible - and maybe part of git already, and it goes against the ""don't rebase branches in use by others"" tenet, my test branch being the other user in this case, but it still seems like it should be possible, and not such a terrible thing if I'm staying inside the area I've not pushed anywhere - i.e. staying inside my commits from the last few hours.

My problem is that we have 10 feature branches going simultaneously.  Each of these features branches lives for anywhere from 2 to 7 days before being merged to 'develop' - that is a LOT of change over the course of a two week sprint.

I merge from develop at least daily just so I can be sure I'm not going to have a huge conflict at the end.  **If I have a feature branch that has been out there for 10 days or more

I know you are going to say ""make smaller branches"".  That is not an option in this case.
