While I was languishing in the Language Centre, to do with linguistics, in order to ingratiate myself yet further with the other linguistics students (including even the phonetics fanatics).

I'm struggling to think of a pun to do with grammaticality that both makes sense and ""Is grandma tickly?"" correct. I'm also stuck on 'morphologician'. (I'm not actually sure that's a particularly logical word for the subject, more for a logician to worry about.)

The problem I have with writing about phonological variation is that one is constantly forced to choose between being fun or logical - very Asian!I always get in trouble with electricians

I like pscycholinguistics – the only department of linguistics where it’s acceptable to wear a cycle helmet.
My Australian accent is terrible but I like to think my Sath Efrican one is predicate.
My favourite accent is Received Pronunciation

Why did the speakers whose native languages weren't English, stop talking to one another? They came to an agreement. (Get it? If not, write your answer on a pastecard and paste it to the below address.)

What did the 'a' say to the 'the'? ""You definitely are ticklish

Why was the small man eaten by the large bear, relative claws.

I think the reason there are so many speakers of Russian is because they all partake in an activity called ""copulae shun"". (Ok, that was Pushkin it.)

I know a man called Hillary who can, did, must, shall and will ride an ox. We call him ""Ox Hillary"".

I always think the verb 'to be' in the sentence 'I just want to be friends' must be in a good mood

Why did the verb cross the node? Because that was its object.

There's a semiotician Ian Eagle and his wife, and his wife'.

I'm doing a paper in discourse analysis. You ask me why I do dis course

Wid ye elect an MP on grounds of their idiolect?

The problem with trying to use 'Li', is that you end up having to pronounce the word 'Li' strangely. (I think I just elide it...)

What did the 'to catch' say as it passed the 'goes' one evening? ""It's a fine night for a verb.""

There was a race between the two parts of the compound noun 'door key'

I can tell that nouns get turned on by pluralisation - they always get an inflection when it happens. (So sorry.)

I'm really annoyed that the word 'perish' hasn't arrived yet, because it's intransitive you know what I mean?""

What do you call an Irish lexicon? A leprechaun POHOHOHOHOHOHOOHOHHOHAHAAAAHAHAAHHAA

One of the teachers at my primary school was sacked for calling her pupils 'Sir' and 'Madam'. She didn't even use the right register!

You should never say or write 'Would you care for some extraordinarily burnt toast?'. When I did it I got 'burnt' by an intensi-fire. (Sorry)

When asked what my favourite lexical category is

A friend once had a section of their garden converted into a swimming pool. But then, ""The section was ~~stolen~~ by our next-door neighbours"". But, due to a speech impediment that prevents him from using the word 'pool', he cannot explain the missing participle.

('the missing part is a pool'? oh

I'm not a homophone. Europe in general is very modern about the whole thing - they let their nouns take any gender they please. As for me

I used to get excited in phonetics lectures when I thought we were about to witness some postal workers tap dancing with their violas but apparently it was just a recording of a postalveolar tap.

Which consonant has the most affricates? Africa of course!

Why was the strangely literal-minded phonetician making a sound that sounded like a so-called 'clear l' but more weird? He had been told to think less literally and more lateral /i/!

If you're ever unsure as to quite what someone means when they declare their love for you using all kinds of exotic words, adverbally phoneme).

The UN gets alarmed whenever I try and emphasise something - there's a lot of intonational stress.

My dad gets angry when I say things like ""fuck you"". He says it's a “vowel” phrase (whatever one of those is).

I was once lost in the New Forest when I came to clearing full of tents. Oddly, an old man crawled out of a tent nearby and came over to me. I asked him why he hadn't responded to me earlier, when I had called. He said, ""Should have used the present tents."" (this kind of works, right?)

Today we learnt about subordinate clauses. Seriously

You know why they call Inuktitut (the language of the Inuit) an agglutinative language? Yes

Three syntacticians walk into A’.



To end on a serious node (it's a terminal one): it is my belief that linguisticians should be interested in investigating the Sidgwick Site because it will help us reveal more about the nature of the language faculty. In fact, UK: the language faculty, as the department is known, is in a building with no ground floor, so you could say it is raised by one level).
