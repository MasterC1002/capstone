Certain people complained that the MIT Mystery Hunt puzzles were too hard because most of them had absolutely no instructions. In response

What I believe to be the first Duck Conundrum is available [here](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/00/set5/6/Puzzle.html). 

Now

---------

**TIME CONUNDRUM**

RULES:

You are about to embark upon a Conundrum. Unlike other puzzles, at each time step, look at what is written on your instructions for that time step, and carry out the instructions. You always carry out one numbered instruction per time step.

Note that you follow the instructions as they are written when you get to them; if instruction 5 says to cross off instruction 4

Unlike other Conundrums, and, if you do things wrong, inconsistencies and grandfather paradoxes. Your goal is to make it through with a single consistent history.

(1) Timesteps

During each time step

* You take the action listed on your instructions under the number of the timestep.
* Any items present act. Items only take actions if you have instructed them to do so, all pushing the button together.
After the timestep is complete

(2) Items

You will encounter various items:

* The name of an item is exactly the string that appears in ALL CAPS whenever the item is mentioned.
* You are not an item.
* An item is ""present"" if it is in the room
* Items will never be brought into or removed from the room without cause. You are not a wizard who can spontaneously create things. Of course
* An item's age is defined as the number of timesteps since it entered the room as measured by an internal clock on the item. So if it entered the room on timestep 4, then on timestep 2 its age is 4. ""Younger"" and ""Older"" refer to comparisons of this age.
* If there are several copies of the same item present and the instructions do not specify a particular one (e.g. they say ""the BANANA"")
* If the instructions refer to ""The BANANA
* A ""DUCK"" is an item that occasionally moves on its own. At the end of each positive prime numbered timestep (after you finish whatever you do, it will enter the TIME MACHINE. If it is in a TIME MACHINE, it will press the Big Red Button on the TIME MACHINE it is in.
*A ""ROBOT"" is an item which, 5, 15, 25, etc), resets the TIME MACHINE's dial to be equal to the ROBOT's current age.

(3) Wording

* ""A BANANA that is yellow"" means that there is exactly one such banana, it does not matter which is being referred to.
* ""All BANANAs"" means all of the bananas. There could be none.
* An object which ""just arrived"" or ""just appeared"" is one which appeared in the middle of the room after the previous timestep and before the current one.

(4) Other Notes

* You will often be told to use letters and numbers interchangeably. You should always use the conversion A=1, unless otherwise specified. You should never have to convert a number that is not between 1 and 26 to a letter.
* If you ever find yourself with several sets of instructions in the room
* Time is infinite in the past and future; you simply take no actions before your instructions begin or after they end.

(5) Starting

* You begin on timestep 0 (the time when you unlocked this puzzle). On timestep 0,"" write in these blanks. They are numbered from left to right.

* The room is empty except for a single TIME MACHINE

*Time Machine Manual*

The TIME MACHINE causes time travel. It has two controls:

* A dial
* A Big Red Button. When pressed, the items appear on timestep 20.
* The items appear in the center of the room (not in the TIME MACHINE)
* The TIME MACHINE does not move itself

**Warmups**

If you've already started the puzzle

But if you have some time before you start

**Warmup A**

0: Begin with an empty room except for a TIME MACHINE with dial set to 0.

1. Get a DUCK and put it in the room.
1. Add 1 to the TIME MACHINE's dial.
1. There is now a DUCK in the TIME MACHINE.
1. There are no DUCKs in the room.
1. There is a DUCK in the center of the room.

**Warmup B**

0: Begin with an empty room except for a TIME MACHINE with dial set to 0.

1. Subtract 1 from the TIME MACHINE's dial.
1. Subtract 2 from the TIME MACHINE's dial.
1. The TIME MACHINE is not empty.

Below is the real Time Conundrum Puzzle.

--------------------------

Answer: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

**Instructions**

1. Hurray! Read the answer from the new INSTRUCTIONS that just appeared. This is the correct answer to the puzzle; go ahead and call it in. You're done!
1. What, the new set of INSTRUCTIONS is necessarily older than the one you brought with you, so make sure to use it instead, according to rule #4.2. But because it has the right answer already written in and we wouldn't want to write over the correct answer, whenever you're told to write a letter, write it in the ""Answer"" blanks on the original (younger) one. Now, write the appropriate letter in the seventh slot. (Not the correct letter; that would lead to a paradox. Write the unique letter which does not lead to a paradox.)
1. Read the TIME MACHINE's dial
1. Read the TIME MACHINE's dial
1. The ROBOT that just appeared is going to reset the TIME MACHINE's dial now. Figure out what he will set it to
1. Ok
1. Note that there are more than 4 items present.
1. Count the number of vowels present in the names of all the items. Subtract the sixth letter of the answer
1. Decrement the time dial by the 4th
1. Count the number of Cs present in the names of all the items present. Write the sum of that number and the time dial in the eighth slot.
1. Go buy a CUCUMBER and put it in the TIME MACHINE.
1. Add the square of the 9th letter of the final answer to the time dial.
1. Press the Big Red Button.
1. Append the following instruction to the end of step 22 of the younger INSTRUCTIONS
1. Having two sets of INSTRUCTIONS is confusing. Burn one. No, two of which you need to transfer over to avoid paradoxes. First, caesar shift the ""S"" in step 4 forward by the 7th letter of the answer. Second, cross out step 12 and replace it with ""Increment the time dial by 4, then square it, then decrement it by 1."" Although, looking back on it, burn one set of INSTRUCTIONS (the one you can burn without causing a paradox).
1. Write the length of the shortest item name present in the 5th slot.
1. Add 7 to the TIME MACHINE's dial.
1. Having the ROBOT around is probably confusing you. Go to the dump and dispose of it.
1. Eat the CUCUMBER
1. Oh, but never actually acquired one. To fix it, you'd better go to the store and buy a new ROBOT. Bring it back and put it in the TIME MACHINE, then press the Big Red Button. Note that eating the CUCUMBER was fine, since you already bought the CUCUMBER in step 11.
1. There is in the room a TIME MACHINE with dial not set to -4! Set it to -4
1. There are two items present with multiple copies of the item (of different ages) present. Put the youngest copy of each in the TIME MACHINE. (One of them might not fit so well
1. Decrement the TIME MACHINE's dial by the eighth letter of the answer.
1. The object present with the shortest name has never been created nor destroyed; it is in a perpetual time loop. Figure out the period of the time loop (using the normal age rules #2.5). Note that this length is equal to the sum of the second and third letters of the answer.
1. Figure out the COMPUTER's age. Add one, then write the result in the 6th slot.
1. Remove the DUCK from the TIME MACHINE.
1. You now have something written in the answer space! It's not the answer of course - you already know the answer, anyway, you have a thing written in the answer slot; maybe you should call it in even though it's wrong?
1. No, open a web browser, and navigate to the puzzle page for this puzzle. Type the phrase written in the answer space into the ""Call In Answer"" box, but don't click submit. Relieve the MONKEY of his current possession, and hand him the COMPUTER you typed into. Put him in the TIME MACHINE.
1. Instruct the MONKEY that on the next timestep he experiences, press the Big Red Button.
1. Increment the TIME MACHINE's dial by 3 less than the 5th letter of the final answer.
1. All right, and write the actual final answer. Xerox these INSTRUCTIONS, and put the original into the TIME MACHINE.
1. Press the Big Red Button. Set the TIME MACHINE's dial to negative the first letter of the final answer, and a set of INSTRUCTIONS. Take the COMPUTER and INSTRUCTIONS with you (but leave the TIME MACHINE). Leave this strange, strange room, and go back to the rest of the Hunt.

23 prisoners go to jail. They are immediately sent to isolated cells and have no communication with one another.

The Warden makes his way from cell to cell

&gt;In the prison is a switch room

&gt;After today

&gt;No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, or I may jump around and come back. Eventually, everyone will have visited the switch room about as many times as everyone else. 

&gt;At any time anyone of you may declare to me

&gt;If it is true, you will be fed to the alligators.""

You learn of the plight of these prisoners and want to try to help them. You have one chance: You can write up a letter with a strategy

What do you tell them to do?

EDIT: For the record

EDIT 2: I recommend trying to solve the puzzle for smaller numbers of prisoners. I have it solved for 5 prisoners right now.

EDIT 3: This remains unsolved as far as I know.

EDIT 4: Since this remains unsolved

    The room has four states: 00, 11. Consider the infinite sequence of states: 
    00 → 01 → 11 → 10 → 00 → ...

    The first time you enter the room
    From that point forward

    So if you first encounter the room in 00
    whenever you can. Pass otherwise.

    This procedure will assign every prisoner to a ""job
    end up with the same job. You should make the declaration to the Warden after 
    you notice that someone else has done your job for you.

Since I just built a regular expression tool that references a 120

So after running it for around a half hour

Edit: Reddit replaced the caret with superscript.  Assume the list was prefiltered by length and the RegEx start and end of word token can be removed.

* RegEx:     ....
* Most common letter in 3861words:     A
* Correct. Find letter and replace in RegEx.
* RegEx:     a...
* Most common letter in 193 words:    S
* Miss.  Update RegEx.
* RegEx:     a[!s][!s][!s]
* Most common letter in 132 words:    E
* Correct. Find letter and replace in RegEx.
* RegEx:     ae[!s][!s]
* Most common letter in 111 words:    O
* Correct. Find letter and replace in RegEx.
* RegEx:     ae[!s]o
* Most common letter in 1 word:    R
* Correct.  Answer is ‘aero’

Here are the top 10 hardest words to guess using this algorithm:

* jazz	21
* jeu	21
* jeux	20
* zill	19
* zax	19
* jazzy	19
* zinc	19
* queue	19
* pazazz	19
* zills	18

But [any regular expression guru](http://xkcd.com/208/) can see that there is a better expression that can be written.  When the second list was generated, but an additional piece of information was gathered when the placement of the letter was revealed.  Namely, ONLY the first letter was an A. 

Using this new information

* RegEx:     ....
* Most common letter in 3861words:     A
* Correct. Find letter and replace in RegEx.
* RegEx:     a[!a][!a][!a]
* Most common letter in 152 words:    E
* Correct. Find letter and replace in RegEx.
* RegEx:     ae[!ae][!ae]
* Most common letter in 3 words:    O
* Correct. Find letter and replace in RegEx.
* RegEx:     ae[!aeo]o
* Most common letter in 1 word:    R
* Correct.  Answer is ‘aero’

And here are the top 10 hardest words to guess using this algorithm:

* zill	19
* zills	18
* yill	18
* yills	17
* will	17
* yin	17
* wills	16
* vill	16
* yins	16
* yuck	16

So the new winner is ‘zill’ (I put the word ‘will’ in the title because it’s the first common word that shows up).  ‘jazz’ can be found in 14 guesses.

Also

So there you have it

but you can't do: 0 + 0 + 0 + 6 = 6 since that would include a digit. also you can't touch the equal sign (for example turning it into &lt;= )

you can use a square root

The river is infinite and straight. The boat is at a station on the river when you start bombing. It has a constant velocity, so the boat goes past the same number of stations every day, always in the same direction. You may only bomb once every 24 hours, and only on midnight.

You can see the official site [here](http://www.oldsantafetradingco.com/the-thrill-resource-page) or the Today show story [here](http://www.today.com/news/want-find-his-hidden-treasure-worth-millions-head-outdoors-1C8576285).  

Here's the poem:


As I have gone alone in there  
And with my treasures bold
I can keep my secret where
And hint of riches new and old.  

Begin it where warm waters halt  
And take it in the canyon down
Not far
Put in below the home of Brown.  

From there it’s no place for the meek
The end is drawing ever nigh;  
There’ll be no paddle up your creek
Just heavy loads and water high.

If you’ve been wise and found the blaze
Look quickly down
But tarry scant with marvel gaze
Just take the chest and go in peace.

So why is it that I must go  
And leave my trove for all to seek?  
The answers I already know  
I’ve done it tired

So hear me all and listen good
Your effort will be worth the cold.  
If you are brave and in the wood  
I give you title to the gold.



And the 3 additional clues:

Clue #10:  
The treasure is hidden higher than 5

Clue #11:  
No need to dig up the old outhouses

Clue #12:  
The treasure is not in a graveyard

But if you manage to get to the shore without goblin standing and waiting for you

The problem is that the goblin is exactly 4 times as fast on dry land as you are rowing your boat.

This game is played with 6 envelopes.  Here are the dollar values of each envelope.(all in USD)

5   10   20   40   80   160

The basic gist of these envelopes is that the value starts at five and doubles each progressive step upwards.
We both draw a random envelope and are told that our envelopes are adjacent in value (either mine is half yours of double). Then we are given the option to switch.

You happen to have the 20 dollar envelope so switching sounds exciting.  You run a quick calculation in your head and calculate your EV to be (10+40)/2

But you are clever.  You think about if I want to switch too.  Assume I have the 10 dollar envelope.  Then my EV is (5+20)/2

Well obviously we both can't gain from switching... somebody has to lose that trade. The prize money doesn't magically multiply by the act of switching. Can you find the flaw in your own reasoning? (:P) Do you want to switch with me?

The problem is that your worker is paranoid.  He has to be paid exactly 1/7 of a gold bar each day every day for all seven days or he will leave.  For example if he has any less than 2/7 on the second day he will think that you will shaft him and leave.  If he has 2/7 on the first day he will take his extra 1/7 that he didn't earn and run away with his small profit.  These rules apply to all the days.

I was watching Bear Grylls in ""Worst Case Scenarios"" a month ago.  In the episode
 
I'll set the scene:

* you are wearing your white-collar business attire and going for a job interview in the middle of nowhere.

* your jeep's engine overheats and starts to break down.  You pull over and notice your mobile phone has died.

* standard desert temperature scenario - extremely hot at night and freezing at night.
 
1.  You want to stop the engine from overheating.  Do you:
a) turn off the air conditioner and turn on the heater
b) release the radiator pressure cap
c) pour water over the engine?
 
2.  Your engine no longer works and you need to find a viable water source.  You take your car's licence plate and walk 30 metres away from the road.  You dig deep and extract large lumps of damp sand.  Using what's around you
 
3.  The temperature is falling below zero
 
4.  The next morning you spot dirt-bikers riding through the desert.  You can't seem to get their attention using a mirror and you want to burn something in the fire to get their attention.  What should you burn?

Edna Mae Wittkop had lived in Michigan's frigidly cold Upper Peninsula all seven decades of her life, had plowed the heavy snow from her driveway early this morning while she'd baked him a pumpkin pie. The pie was still warm when she decided to deliver it.

She slipped her feet into a pair of heavy boots and threw on a down jacket, lifted the pie and waddled out the kitchen door. Edna Mae made her way carefully down the freshly shoveled driveway and across the street.

Breathing raggedly, huffing from exertion. She entered and stopped cold in her tracks.

**EDIT #3 (10/8/12 4:30PM ET): Didn't think anyone would be still be going at it! Again, but so far no winners. (Thank you to those who have tried and are still trying!)**

Hints for once you get past the Kansuko puzzle part...

* There is a special subreddit with hidden clues. If you find this subreddit
* There is a special user account that has been leaving comments for over 30 days. These comments are seemingly innocent
* The first letter of the encrypted phrase is H.
* The hidden clues on the subreddit tell you the post and particular word to take the first letter from
* The encrypted phrase will need a keyword to decipher.
* Once decrypted

I'll give it another day or so before getting REALLY specific.


**EDIT #2: Enter as many times as you'd like. Think of it like the National Treasure movie. There are some seemingly innocent 'posts' or DoGood letters, and pull out each letter. I've given you the first letter to confirm if you're on the right path.**

Thanks to all those that have attempted so far


**EDIT #1:  12 hours in and no winners yet. I guess I did make it a little difficult. Some people have gotten pretty far, the puzzle/clues span over 17 subreddits in the past 30 days, but you don't need to visit each one!**

So I fixed some of the problems they found

-------

To celebrate, agreed to give away 5 books. To top it off, I'll personally throw in **[Reddit Gold](http://www.reddit.com/help/gold/)** and other goodies to the first 5 people who finish the scavenger hunt.

*Warning - I love National Treasure

The hunt starts at [www.kansuko.com](http://www.kansuko.com) - simply type ""reddit"" as the Puzzle ID.  It might help to try an easy one before attempting the Reddit puzzle. Use the ""Check Your Work"" button as you go and when you're finished! This puzzle is about Intermediate level. 

The hunt will take you all over Reddit. I'm also posting in /r/codes

Nothing in MY post history will help with this challenge.

Work alone or together

Unfortunately after the cable was laid it was discovered that the individual wires are not labeled. There is no visual way of knowing which wire is which and thus connections at either end is not immediately possible.
&gt;
&gt;You are a trainee technician and your boss has asked you to identify and label the wires at both ends without ripping it all up. You have no transport and only a battery and light bulb to test continuity. You do have tape and pen for labeling the wires. What is the shortest distance in kilometers you will need to walk to correctly identify and label each wire? 

I have a solution that I believe produces the optimal answer.

edit: For the bulb to light up, A and B, and you attach them to the plus and minus of the battery respectively. The light bulb will light up either way you attach the wires to it.

You have a massive bucket containing 99, and select another. It's grey. You repeat this process a few more times, and each time you do it, the marble is grey. Suddenly, an onlooker speaks out: 

**OBSERVER**: 5 to nothing; grey in the lead!

**YOU**: What's the point in keeping score? You know grey will win.

**OBSERVER**: Perhaps so. But if you were to repeat this process indefinitely

**YOU**: That's almost impossible; grey is already winning by five. Soon

**OBSERVER**: I don't think you understand how long a time *infinity* is. If you repeat this process indefinitely

**YOU**: That may be true

What do you think? If you iterate this process *forever*

**PROBLEM TWO**

This problem is similar to the first. You have another bucket

In the bucket are one red marble and one grey marble. You select one at random. You then put it back and then add grey marbles to the bucket such that the new total number of marbles inside the bucket is twice what it was before. Then you select another marble and repeat the process. (So after the first selection, etc.)

I'm working on my design thesis and it's going pretty well. All my projects are coming together—except one. 

I'm trying to come up with a 3 word phrase that loops

1) *3 word phrase that loops.* This is pretty straight forward. There are three different iterations of the phrase. Word 1, 3, 1; then 3, 1, 2; and back to the original. 

2) *Each iteration has a different (or slightly different) meaning.* Here's a basic example. ""Dogs run fast."" It can be looped to ""Run fast [

3) *The phrase is self aware.* This is the most important part. I've come up with several good phrases (out of the 100+ I've made)

I'm way overdue on this project. **I discussed it with my prof and he suggested I post it online to see if I can get some help.** Once I decide on the phrase there's still a lot of work to be done in converting each word to images and designing posters.

Thanks guys.

In order to get a plane ticket reimbursed, I needed the ticket number. The airline told me that I was looking for a 13-digit ticket number starting with '001', and that it would appear on my bank statement. 

When I checked my bank statement, there are only 100 possibilities for the complete ticket number, given the information I had (assuming my hypothesis was correct). 

So I decided to try all of the 13-digit possibilities on the airline's website until I found my ticket number (001xxxxxxxx00, ...). As I tried one wrong combination after another, I felt myself slowly losing confidence that this process would succeed. It didn't feel like my confidence was declining linearly either. Each successive failure seemed more damning than the last. The first few wrong guesses didn’t concern me much at all, but as I got closer and closer to exhausting all the possibilities without finding my ticket, my confidence began to decline drastically. Is this rational?

Suppose that before I began guessing
after n wrong guesses? How should my confidence change with each successive failure?

Many levels consist in turning on the lights pairwise and you want all the lights to be on to finish the level (but you are completely aware

You have two rooms, with the following rules:

* you can press one switch one at a time
* each switch controls exactly one light (there is a 1-1 bijection)
* if the corresponding light is on, pressing the switch will turn the light on
* when two lights of the same color are on at the same time
* if there is a light (color A) on and I press the switch which turns on another light (color B)
* if there is a light (color A) on and I press the switch corresponding to a light which is already on

When all the lights are on

Example with 2 colors (4 bulbs
[123142 should do the trick (I will denote (ab) two bulbs with the same color and choose an arbitrary ordering)
* (12)(34): the first two switches turn on bulbs of the same color, then 2 does nothing
* (13)(24): pressing 1, the 31 are the same color and 24 are the same color
* (14)(23): pressing 1


The example with 6 is rather surprising

There is a trivial solution, but I wonder if it possible to go from O(n^2) to O(n*log n) or something intermediate.

__________________________________________

I pick two real numbers through some process unknown to you. It might be random and it might not. Maybe I always pick ""3"" and ""100"". Maybe I roll two dice. Maybe I write C code by mashing a keyboard until it compiles and prints two numbers (or produces Windows ME). Maybe I always use 0 for the first number, my aunt is used to that kind of call from me.)

I put these two numbers on slips of paper and put them in two envelopes. I thoroughly shuffle the envelopes

Your goal is to pick the envelope with the higher number. Can you come up with a strategy that guarantees you a better-than-even chance of winning?

It has to do better than 50% no matter how I picked the numbers--if your strategy includes the rule ""switch if the number is a 2"", and in that scenario your strategy will fail at least 50% of the time. This means your strategy must work even if I have guessed what your strategy is and am cherry-picking numbers specifically to defeat it.

I cannot emphasize enough that you do not know anything about my process. Not only do you not know the numbers

Edit: Added that the numbers are distinct.

Solution:
[Call the number you saw ""x"". Use the logistic function to calculate p(x)=1/(1+e^-x). Choose a random real number between 0 and 1. If it's lower than p(x)

Assume there are four persons – a student, and the Devil.  
Assume you are one of them –  only you don't know which.  
Your task is to figure this out by a single yes-no question to the remaining three.

The following conditions are presumed to hold:  
(1) The TV license inspector never lies.  
(2) The student only lies to the TV license inspector.  
(3) The politician only speaks the truth to the Devil.  
(4) The Devil always lies – except when the person asking the question knows the right answer beforehand: in that case the Devil speaks the truth.  
(5) Everyone involved knows these conditions hold.

____
The following clarifications are given to serve the interpretation:  

- [The concepts of asking and answering a question allow 'reflexivity'

- One is said to know the right answer beforehand if and only if one can tell whether a given answer is truthful without recourse to the other answers to the question.  
- No 'observational' information is available apart from the given answers.  
- ”Given answers” bear no meaning other than a set of three yes-or-no's.  
- The persons involved speak the (un)truth according to the conditions 1-5 alone – whether or not they know who they are themselves.  
- ”A single question” means one and the same question for everyone.

Rules:

Several termites have stumbled across a perfectly good rotting log in the middle of the woods.  Look at [this section](http://i.imgur.com/zPG3D.jpg) if you don't believe me.  Well...finders keepers.  The only problem is

1. The log is broken up into cells containing various amounts of sustenance.  The bugs can enter a cell in the log through any opening in the bark adjacent to their current position.  They cannot exit and reenter the log at a different location.

2. The bugs can claim a contiguous region of cells.  Specifically

3. There are two classes of termites

4. These termites are very territorial.  Because of the massive infighting

5. I don't really know that much about bugs.

Here's that image link in case you missed it: [http://i.imgur.com/zPG3D.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/zPG3D.jpg)

Some of you might find this useful.

I found a [site](http://puzzles.about.com/od/freeeasynytimescrossword/Free_Daily_Easy_New_York_Times_Crossword_Puzzles.htm) with some older M, give them uniform names (they have a dizzying array of naming schemes - I've named them m001-puz.pdf for the first Monday puzzle, w151-sol.gif for the solution to the 151st Wednesday puzzle, etc. based on the numbers used on this site).

Next, you can print a page with a puzzle and the solution on the reverse!

I had a professor this past semester who promised 10 pop quizzes throughout the semester. The end of the semester was drawing near

Well, we can cross that one out as well. Of course, this reasoning soon arrives at the conclusion that on NO day would the pop quiz truly be a surprise. The days wound down. The last day of class came, and there was a pop quiz, and I was not surprised. But would I have been surprised if it had been the second to last day? That requires the possibility of the final day having a quiz, thus not being a surprise. The possibility of the last day having a quiz is necessary for any of the earlier days to have potentially surprising quizzes. 

I'm a lover of logic puzzles (though new to this subreddit)

I've bounced a lot of ideas around and I think I've come up with the following mechanics.

The questions are always in the form of ""What's so special about _______?"" where _______ is either a commonly known person or object with an uncommonly known fact or where it is a person or object that is not commonly known.

For example:
Q: What's so special about Pluto?
A: It used to be considered a planet.

Given the question the contestants ask yes or no questions to get to the answer.

The second mechanic to the show would be that the contestants can suggest changes the rules of the competition after answering a question right and that the host would generally grant the rules changes provided they aren't entirely unfair.

I'd like to get a test run going soon. I was thinking 3 contestants on each of two teams

If there is enough interest I may do a test run as soon as tonight.

Organize 40 numbers 1, and 14 3s. (The value doesn't matter, so you can use ABC as well)

Each row makes overlapping ""sets"". A set is 3 different numbers, and so on: sets are in position 123,345,567,789.

EDIT: Okay it's solved by our resident expert on bubblebaths.

EDIT 2:

But I found a new constraint: Don't use a both a column and its complement. 1113 Complements 1112, 2223/3323, etc. This leaves only 10 columns ( and matching offsets or complements) to choose from, to fit 10 slots! Now it's just a matter of ordering these and choosing which offset/complement to use!

The available columns:

    1111111122
    1112222222
    1221223323
    2233232333

The complements (minus complements which are also offsets):

    111 11113
    111 33333
    133 33223
    332 32322

Apparently no love over at /r/math. This is a problem of my own creation and wanted to see what people here thought. I submitted the solution to a mod to verify this isn't just a troll or stupid guessing game. I am sharing this because I think people will be genuinely amused by the answer.

Hints:

[spoiler](/s""This problem is objectively logical and if you get the answer you will have NO doubt it is the one and only answer. I am sure there are plenty of boring coincidences."")

[spoiler](/s""It is not complex

Hint / Why I think it is interesting:

[spoiler](/s""The three 'incorrect' answers represent a unique / complete set

Disclaimer / JUST in case you have doubts or it needs to be clarified:

1. [spoiler](/s""One of the properties that makes the set unique is that all the words have six letters. Removing that quality

2. [spoiler](/s""...but not larger than 6"")

3. [spoiler](/s""Technically

4. [spoiler](/s""...and to get really technical

Theresa kneaded her forehead with her fingers

""You sure? I don't like leaving you here alone with him.""

Theresa nodded

When Theresa didn't show up at the next house, but the phone kicked into voicemail after just a few rings. She left a message: ""Theresa, where are you? I'm going to finish the Smyth's house and then go get my daughter. I'll see you tomorrow.""

Mrs Fernandez returned home to a sparkling clean house at 6pm. When she walked to the backyard

1364290723.0,1b17bc,Need some help with a formula to handicap scores in a competition. [ REDDIT GOLD AVAILABLE ],throwawayhugo,3,3,3,"Hi all

I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this kind of thing

I'm creating a competition where the most improved customer (in terms of sales volume compared to their previous trading year) wins a prize. Note: When I say 'customer' I actually mean a reseller of our product. The aim of the competition is to incentivize our resellers' sales teams to sell more of our product.

However

* 2 customers = 43%
* 9 customers = 32.7%
* 9 customers = 11%
* 14 customers = 10%
* Remaining customers = 3.6%

Currently,000 units of sales last year, this year he sells 55,000 - a 10% increase.

Obviously,000,000 volume of sales compared a smaller one of 10,000.

To make the competition fairer it was decided that 50

This was satisfactory to everyone, and there still existed the problem of being unfair to larger businesses, as if one of the smaller companies won a single large account they would gain a large % increase over their previous year and win the competition.

So my proposed solution: A handicap to be placed on the companies which scales by volume. e.g. For every extra 10

Customer 1 previous year: 100
Customer 1 current year: 120
Increase 20%
Increase with handicap 21.2%

Customer 2 previous year: 400
Customer 2 current year: 470
Increase 18%
Increase with handicap 21.6%

Using the above formula there is a slight advantage that can be seen from dealing with a larger volume. However

https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_P0LTB1J3UIc1Yzck15aHRhM0E/edit?usp=sharing

I’d like your collective help in thinking up a new/improved formula to handicap the lower volume resellers to make it fairer for everyone. Or a complete redesign of the competition which also makes it fair for everyone.
As this is for a competition it needs to be as simple to understand as possible.

If anyone provides a better solution I’ll give them reddit gold. I know this isn't a large reward

Here's one I was toying around with:
The riddle area shows ""1?"". The answer field shows ""(blank)+(blank)-(blank)"". You have 5 buttons, 5 and 6 sided irregular polygons and a loop (no vertices).

-I will bring with me anyone who can guess the colour of his own eyes. I will come back everyday

Unfortunately, but they don't trust each other so communication is also out of the question. Before leaving, though, the captain says one last thing ""I see at least one person with blue eyes"".

B plus C is 7 more than D plus A

The answer is divisible by 2

B times the D is 15 more than C times than A

I was never very good at algebra so this is the best I've come up with.
B=(15+CA)/D

DB=CA+15

B=(D+A+7)-C
