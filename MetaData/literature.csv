The falcon cannot hear the falconer;

Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;

Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world

The blood-dimmed tide is loosed

The ceremony of innocence is drowned;

The best lack all conviction

Are full of passionate intensity.


Surely some revelation is at hand;

Surely the Second Coming is at hand.

The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out

When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi

Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert

A shape with lion body and the head of a man

A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun

Is moving its slow thighs

Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.

The darkness drops again; but now I know

That twenty centuries of stony sleep

Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle

1370284146.0,1flgxx,The case for Lolita: how to recommend a favourite novel and not seem like a weirdo,cafeBellow,175,38,79,"
I don’t know why Lolita is so taboo today. Well that’s a lie

But one has to put it in context. Nabokov’s Lolita has sold more copies than Harper Lee’s To Kill A Mocking Bird, more then any Dan Brown. And at any rate, Lolita was very quickly a massive commercial success. 
          
So the more pertinent question is: when and why did it become unmentionable? 

My guess is that it has always been pretty taboo. But what I notice and really hate is that people who have never read it or any of Nabokov’s other works are the quickest to scorn it

And as someone who occasionally takes a book out of home, and a man who wrote prose ecstatically. But I did, and the times that I have read the book I don’t ever remember going to a public place with it. And you would rightfully then ask: are you not just perpetuating this taboo you are here trying to debunk? Regretfully, yes. But as a reader, after an opening page of this: 

	Did she have a precursor? She did, one summer, a certain initial girl-	child. In a princedom by the sea. Oh when? About as many years before Lolita 	was born, as my age was that summer…
  
	[Spoiler alert – don’t read on if you want to read the book and haven’t] 

Given that

So you see, he, Nabokov, was not writing for the fiery and simple-minded libertarian any more then he is writing for the reserved libertine; he was writing for readers, and those who can read him, will be well rewarded. 

The narrator and main character: Humbert Humbert

Finding himself where he does: a Northeastern American city
But suddenly, Humbert finds Lolita by accident. To get her, he goes through a chaotic, grotesque and hilariously erotic choreograph. 

He will do anything, with all the lies and distastes that that implies. And Charlotte, deeply in love with the charming, good-looking, cosmopolitan Humbert, immediately sends Lolita away to camp, so the “lovers” can be alone together. Out of the sheer necessity of the lies, the need for her murder. 

Fate, anxious plotting goes to waste. A dream come true! 

Now with his little stepdaughter

It turns into a nightmare. Two years and two lengthy circuits across the American scene, because he never really has her, only her body. In the end, his punishment: Lolita runs off with a monster. Humbert, in despair, attempts to track them; after bouncing around the country, into a sanitarium, Lolita finds him. Now a different person

And as Nabokov famously said: “Lolita has no moral.” 

But all I can say is that Humbert’s fate seems classically tragic; Humbert is the hero with the disgustingly tragic flaw. Humbert is the symbol of every man driven by desire.

1376408746.0,1ka7lh,What is Postmodernism?,bronzeclocksofbenin,177,51,101,"Seeing as that my other post on the postmodern canon was so popular

**1:** What do you think defines postmodernism? Do you think it's existence relies on the ideas of modernism (i.e.

**2:** Do you think postmodernism is a literary school of thought or a literary time period? Do you think Cervantes and Sterne could be considered postmodern writers? 

**3:** Is postmodernism still applicable to the present world? Will the Dada-like questioning of the literary experience ever disappear form the literary scene?

**4:** What are the main problems of postmodernism? Is postmodernism a perfect device with which we may describe the world

**5:** Do you think postmodernism is defined by an ontological contortion

**6:** Is postmodernism destroying or elevating the artistic experience in literature? Would you consider a postmodern text art even if it blatantly attacks the idea of coherent artistry?

**My own analysis:** This is my attempt at a definition of postmodernism

""Modernism deals with the angst of a world that is falling to ruin. The modernist writer explores this by examining the psychological state of the individual. For the modernist, which utilizes stream-of-consciousness to examine the life of a man in a single day.

Meanwhile, the individual's journey through space and time is less epistemological and more ontological. Such a journey is complicated because, unlike the modernist, the post-modernist sees reality is relative; i.e., all reality is socially constructed. Example: Alasdair Gray's ""Lanark"", where reality is fluid and seems to echo the protagonist's fears and feelings.

All in all, nostalgia, or angst. The post-modernist is like Coleridge ; the writer tries to make the fantastic commonplace by emphasizing ontological phenomenon."" 

So, I believe that Cervantes and Sterne could be considered postmodern writers due to their attack of a coherent reality and a questioning of the aesthetic. Postmodernism relies upon modernism for the most part, but it can exist in special circumstances as defined above. Postmodernism is defined by its questioning of the ontological and the nature of static existence, and I would also like to add that postmodernism depends heavily on the questioning of the value of the literary medium itself (thanks to davinox for this input). The main problem plaguing postmodernism today is that its running out of fuel: in the same way that modernism relied upon a seemingly decaying world of pre-WWII Europe, the idea of postmodernism relies upon a fluid view of reality brought about by the rapid demise of the European superpower (or, in Cervantes' case, the fall of the age of chivalry). Ultimately, and we not at that end anymore. The Cold War is over, India, and the developed parts of Asia will see a new literary movement separate from postmodernism. In conclusion

1366073168.0,1cffvm,Let's talk about 20th Century Japanese Lit.,massdisasterblast,144,26,32,"There is a lot of love among our generation (I'm 29, I thought I'd kick off what I hope is an interesting thread about some of the most loved and thought-provoking works and writers we can come up with.  I'll start with some of the biggies:

The Setting Sun by Osamu Dazai -  A book about the waning days of the old guard of the Japanese aristocracy, and the existential crises she encounters as her world changes.  It is a work that covers a lot of ground.  It tackles her evolving sense of her place in the world, the dissipation of her aspiring artist brother as well his dabbling in Marxist thought, leading to his eventual suicide, and the role of the artist - both literary and traditional - in post-WWII society.  Also of importance is the nature of the ""influx"" of western thought into her world, shown in one instance through her idiosyncratic understanding of Chekov.  It contains a lot of cool, thought provoking ideas, paraphrased, and is deeply critical of their self-destructive lifestyles.  I would consider it sort of a Japanese The Sun Also Rises

Thousand Cranes, Kawabata has a famously understated style.  His works are also about the melding of old Japanese thought with new western-impacted ways of thinking and living, and his prose is excruciatingly beautiful.  He mourns loss and mourns the human condition, and his works are a tribute to emptiness and loneliness.  Snow Country is probably his most famous work but Thousand Cranes is my favorite; his description of the intricacies of the Japanese tea ceremony are transcendant.  Again, mourning is the name of the game with Kawabata, as well as his fascination with what I would describe as ""sublime nothingness.""  A word of warning, though:  To us readers today, some of his allusions and foreshadowing can be a bit heavy handed.

Spring Snow by Yukio Mishima - This is the first book of Mishima's so-called Sea of Fertility tetralogy, this book helps the uninitiated such as myself better understand the intricacies of the 20th Japanese ""human condition"".  It is a story that takes place after the Russo-Japanese war about a young man from a sort of nouveau riche family reared in an old aristocratic household for the sake of social standing and refinement.  Mishima was also a singular genius, and though much is made about his incredible personal life for good reason, his art is stunning.  Beauty, heartbreak, longing, and a tenacious desire to encapsulate the Japanese ethos set this work apart.  This book is Mishima coming into his own as another Japanese writer who should have won the Nobel.

A Personal Matter by Kenzaburo Oe - This one is a postmodern classic by another Nobel laureate.  A story of a man grappling with what you have to consider as the aftermath of a bout of a nihilistic loss of all hope, you may want to check this out.

Kokoro by Natsume Soseki - Another book about the changing nature of Japan,"" as he is called, are particularly enlightening.  Even when you finish this one, the nature of the sensei's story and his telling of it leave you with more questions than answers, and you begin to have the idea that everything is perhaps not quite as it seems.  I read this work over a decade ago, and I still think about it fairly often.

Obviously I've just barely touched on some of the most famous works of the past hundred years, by all rights, be included.  These are books you would read in an Intro to Japanese Lit class, so they seem like a good place to start.  I would be interested in other works you guys seem to think I erroneously omitted, because like I said this is just a very superficial start.",,False,t5_2qhps,True

Anyway

Wizard of the Crow by Ngugi wa Thiong'o (Kenya): This book is hilarious, but I don't know if there is a contemporary African author who is a better writer than Ngugi. He also wrote the classics Petals of Blood and A Grain of Wheat, which, although quite different and of an earlier era, and with different goals than Wizard of the Crow, are also highly recommended as well. Ngugi is a writer who I'd very much like to see win the Nobel.

Anthills of the Savannah by Chinua Achebe (Nigeria): Achebe is an author a lot of people have read, which I think is fantastic. However, Anthills is a very strong book in its own right, and I find it to be the better novel. I don't know if there is a better work on the problems of post-colonial governance.

Houseboy by Ferdinand Oyono (Cameroon): A very powerful and enraging novel about the waining days of French Colonialism in Africa, and very bleak in some ways.

Xala by Ousmane Sembene (Senegal): A searing novel (it was adapted into a very fine film by the author), to a degree, the trouble of the synthesis of the colonial style of governance with deeply-ingrained African social and moral codes. This one is fairly bleak too, and the film, in particular, has a pretty troubling final act.

The Book of Chameleons by Jose Eduardo Agualusa (Angola): This one is different from the other books I've listed. It is a very recent novel (I believe from 2007), dreams, reincarnation, and reinvention, and features as its narrator a lizard who lives on the walls of a house who is a reincarnated Jorge Luis Borges - and, as I've learned on reddit, much to my delight, as I said previously it is quite literally an oneiric work. However

I like to see Chekhov's opus as a study of man in general. From early stories like Heartache, and ""understands"". To the angst we find in Vanya, angry at having arrived at middle age and with not much to show for it. Having expected greatness of himself, he has to reconcile his reality with his dreams, as we all do. There are no villains and no evil in the world, everyone does what they believe they have to do. 

In such stories as ""Anna on the Neck"", due to her affairs with his superiors? Is it her fault that she becomes a cold and calculating femme fatale, or is it a society that has delegated her to a piece of decoration for the rich and powerful men and has deprived her of any meaningful method of personal advancement? 

In another story, laden with gifts given to her by ""admirers"". He loves her and knows it was his fault, he wasn't there for her and she grew up with a cruel taste of wealth but none of the ability. As he weeps over his grave, he asks God to forgive her even if she was a whore. 

Chekhov's true skill lies in capturing the whole of experience in select works. Time is transitory and human beings live either in the future or the past, he is concerned with creating portraits that convey the present as well as possible and transmit timeless landscapes of human interaction. 


Any grand ideal or message in Chekhov is intrinsic to the situation and not to the story or the writer's own method. We may find vestiges of philosophy and the like but these are natural outgrowths of treating humanity with sympathy and simply telling their stories

*The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner* by James Hogg

This tells the story of a young man who believes that because he is one of the righteous and saved, or may not exist at all. Published anonymously in Scotland 1824, it's one of the best examinations of totalitarian thought I've ever read.  

*Jurgen* by James Branch Cabell

A comic fantasy novel from 1919 that is also a thoughtful examination of religious belief and the meaning of aesthetic beauty, the more rewarding it becomes.

*The Arabian Nightmare* by Robert Irwin 

The tale of an English spy in 15th century Cairo who finds himself afflicted with strange dreams that pull him into a world of stories, often exciting tale.

Edit: Here are a few more I thought of while reading through people's responses:

*The Ballad of Typhoid Mary* by Jürg Federspiel

Morbid and interesting piece of historical fiction the details the life of Mary Mallone, but highly fictionalized to comment on the society of turn of the century America and foaming with a witty gallows humor.

*Traps* by Friedrich Duerrenmatt

Tells the story of a man who finds his himself on trial as part of a parlor game. What starts as an interesting diversion turns into an examination of guilt and justice.

**From his correspondences:**

&gt;I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound and stab us. If the book we are reading doesn't wake us up with a blow on the head, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea inside us.

                                                    * * *

&gt;We are as forlorn as children lost in the woods. When you stand in front of me and look at me, as reflectively, as lovingly, as we would before the entrance to Hell.

                                                    * * *

&gt;Write to me only once a week, I answer one of your letters, then lie in bed in apparent calm, but my heart beats through my entire body and is conscious only of you. I belong to you; there is really no other way of expressing it, and that is not strong enough. But for this very reason I don’t want to know what you are wearing; it confuses me so much that I cannot deal with life; and that’s why I don’t want to know that you are fond of me. If I did, how could I, fool that I am, or here at home

                                                    * * *

&gt;I write differently from what I speak, and so it all proceeds into deepest darkness.

                                                    * * *

&gt;You once said that you would like to sit beside me while I write. Listen, when involved with others, would feel he was losing himself, and from which, therefore, he will always shrink as long as he is in his right mind… That is why one can never be alone enough when one writes, why there can never be enough silence around one when one writes

                                                    * * *

**The Castle:**

&gt;I can’t think of any greater happiness than to be with you all the time, even though I feel that here in this world there’s no undisturbed place for our love, neither in the village nor anywhere else; and I dream of a grave, deep and narrow, where we could clasp each other in our arms as with clamps, and I would hide my face in you and you would hide your face in me, and nobody would ever see us any more.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/vz247/happy_birthday_franz/

1. Gosh this arts vs sciences stuff is heavy-handed. Could this have been handled better by Atwood? How?

2. The technology has aged in an unflattering way that I think Atwood could have easily foreseen/fixed -- especially as she goes into some detail in a note at the back of the book about all the research she did. CD-Roms? Really? Did this bother you?

3. Plot point: I didn't buy Jimmy/Snowman's reason for shooting Crake, it somewhat ruined the story for me. Yes, Crake just killed Oryx. It still doesn't make sense to me. Can anyone explain it? Did anyone else feel that it required a suspension of disbelief/was Atwood really stretching character to fit plot?

4. Leaving the radio in the watchtower and that not causing some angst. Snowman's response when he realises he's left it: oh well. After he heard voices on it anyway? Really? Just unbelievable and seems like a forced plot point.

5. Oryx's character. Atwood has written some amazing feminist things -- Handmaid's Tale of course comes to mind -- but Oryx's character is such a cipher that I had to suspend disbelief for her. Is Snowman's memory that untrustworthy? I feel as if we're meant to trust Snowman's memories (or else the narrative structure doesn't make sense) but then Oryx is completely unbelievable.

* Cathy/Kate: her character is among the more controversial aspects of the book. I've heard critics complain that her character was boring and unbelievable because she is ""all evil"". While normally I'm not a fan of one dimensional characters, and forces the people around her to confront their own. Because of her twisted world view she is unable to see the good in others, a view which other characters, especially Adam and Cal, go great lengths to disprove to themselves. My English teacher always said that a character cannot be a symbol, but her existence as pure evil may be one of the few exceptions to this rule.

* The ability to choose goodness: This theme one of the most prevalent in the novel and is lain out clearly in Lee's ""Timshel"" discussion (which I personally found to be one of the most profound and inspiring scenes I've ever read). Steinbeck expresses the idea that you can choose to be good, Abra in response to Aron's perceived image of purity, Aron after finding his mother, etc.) Cal struggles with this the most, trying to force his way into virtue until Adam presents this ultimate choice on his deathbed.

* Inheritance: One of the largest barriers for the other characters to ""choose goodness"" is the guilt they feel from what they have inherited. This inheritance is often portrayed as money (such as Adam's inheritance of Cyrus' stolen money and Aron's inheritance of Cathy's money), to choose goodness. The failure to do so is shown in Aron, who after learning about is mother becomes distraught and broken, indirectly leading to his death.

* Steinbeck's maximalist, detailed environmental descriptions, and brief comments about various aspects of early 20th century life, I have to admit I filed to see the importance in some of the side plot lines. I found the long, regular descriptions of the Hamilton family excessive, and personally I think these should have been shortened considerably (I do, however

&gt;""Critical appreciation"" means having smart, especially in writing. Vital for critical appreciation is the ability to “interpret” a piece of literature, which basically means coming up with a cogent, interesting account of what a piece of lit means, what it’s trying to do to/for the reader, what technical choices the author’s made in order to try to achieve the effects she wants, and so on.

Which resonates with something I've been thinking about — I feel I don't usually get everything I can out of a literary text, so I'm looking for recommendations of books, essays, what-have-you to educate myself. Any guidance would be appreciated.

1353240018.0,13e9eg,Hello r/Literature. Newbie here. ,Ezera,70,23,38,"Hello everybody

To start things off

I have not read a lot of books so far and I'd like to change that. Off the top of my head

- The History of Love
- A Farewell to Arms
- Breakfast of Champions
- Disgrace
- Lord of the Flies
- Jane Eyre

I am currently reading 1984 by Orwell, with little tid-bits here and there on how to be an efficient dictator and how to oppress optimally. 

Brave New World by Huxley is next on my list and I feel that 1984 will serve as an excellent prelude to it from what I've gathered from a few friends I have. Some of the political theory goes way above my head and I'm not quite sure what to do about that at the moment. Also

I was hoping that /r/Literature could give me a few tips, but I do believe it's an idiom coined by Shakespeare! God isn't this language amazing?). I'm not entirely sure on what my preferences on books are currently, but I think I prefer more modern books; whatever the adjective modern entails in the world of literature! To explain myself a little bit, I would have to say that I prefer a more ""now""-style of writing. I found the language in Jane Eyre a little daunting, and when I was reading Disgrace, I found the text to be soft and mellow as I drifted along the story. I'm sorry if I don't make any sense.

Lastly

Thank you for taking time off reddit-ing to read this. Cheers!",,t5_2qhps,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/13e9eg/hello_rliterature_newbie_here/

From *Invictus* By William Henley

     ""In the fell clutch of circumstance
     I have not winced nor cried aloud.
     Under the bludgeonings of chance
     My head is bloody

    

Also from The Things They Carried

    ""A true war story is never moral. It does not instruct
     human behavior
     not believe it. If at the end of a war story you feel uplifted
     rectitude has been salvaged from the larger waste
     and terrible lie. There is no rectitude whatsoever. There is no virtue. As a first rule of thumb
     you can tell a true war story by its absolute and uncompromising allegiance to obscenity and evil. And 
     in the end
     way that dawn spreads out on a river when you know you must cross the river and march into the 
     mountains and do things you are afraid to do. It's about love and memory. It's about sorrow. It's about
     sisters who never write back and people who never listen.”

    

and from Cormac McCarthy's Novel ""The Road"".  I don't know if this is my favorite quote from the book (there are too many to count or judge) but for some reason this passage always leaves me feeling breathless and could not have been a better ending to the book.

    ""Once there were brook trout in the streams in the mounains. You could see them standing in the amber
     current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. They smelled of moss in your hand.
     Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in
     its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep
     glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery.”

To relate back to Fahrenheit specifically, it could be. But as far as relation to the real world? Maybe not so much, especially how things are today (internet, etc).

Anton Chigurh is a killer. He’s ruthless, and poised; he doesn't show the slightest amount of remorse for his actions. As readers, we cannot help but be stunned by his relentless disregard for human life. Even his fellow hit men label him as a “goddamned psychopath”.  Despite this however, Chigurh evokes an inexplicable feeling of admiration, or at the very least a sense of awe—he seems to operate on a different level than most of us. There is a strange sense of order and consistency to Chigurh’s actions, and McCarthy paints his character as something more akin to a force of nature rather than a human being. It seems far fetched to think that someone who acts like little more than a killing machine could have anything even faintly resembling a moral code, yet the underlying order of Chigurh’s behaviors suggest that there are principles that he lives by that have shaped Chigurh into the character that he is.

The Wizard of the Crow:  This is Ngugi's most recent novel, farce, and satire in a novel that is a (admittedly longwinded) distillation of the experience of postcolonial SubSaharan governance and, more broadly, life.  This book is hilarious, and you'll find humour in its pages that sees Ngugi in a more whimsical place than you're likely to see in his earlier books, which focus more on the problems of Kenyan independence and all the troubles brought by the Mau Mau Uprising and so forth (more on that below).  I really don't want to give too much away

Weep Not, it is interesting to read if you have a fascination, like I do, in seeking out where an author finds their voice.  It is a story about the relationships between colonizer and colonized, labor, economics, and violence.  So, it is a Ngugi novel.  However, almost as if the book could serve as an outline to Ngugi's more major works.

The River Between:  This is a book about change, because, like Chinua Achebe's famous Things Fall Apart, it seeks to describe in 150 pages the roots of discord in colonial African culture, and succeeds in a rare way.  It is a top down look at ""how we got to where we are"" in Kenya in the mid-twentieth century.

A Grain of Wheat:  In the most broad sense, setting it apart Ngugi's earlier works, this book is much more about interpersonal relationships in a context which most of us will find alien, at least to a degree.  Once again we find themes of older East African modes of thought clashing with colonially-influenced, nascent ways of interpreting the world, but Ngugi here really delves into how these changing thought processes effect people on an individual level.  More required reading.

Petals of Blood:  In my (admittedly pretty worthless) opinion, this one touches on Ngugi's familiar themes of education, isolation, and colonial influence on thought, while expanding his ideas on self-governance and the personal toll revolution, violence, and social change have on the individual.  This is not a long book, it is this one.  Once again, sometimes mysterious

The largest suggestion of this is when the narrator's train of thought gets interrupted when something happens to Tom in the novel. I don't have the book with me at the moment, when Dickie wakes up from his nap and sees Tom staring at him.  
  
The narrator is also extremely sympathetic to Tom's point of view. The most concrete evidence of this is that the narrator describes people very similarly to how Tom describes people. The narrator focuses on things like Marges shape and ugly hair, but I believe this has a larger meaning.   
  
The third person narration would make sense in Tom Ripley's case because it emphasizes the detachment that Tom has from the rest of the world. Tom easily switches identities and can examine the identity of ""Tom"" through someones else's eyes with relative ease. When pretending to be Dickie

One class I am taking is ""Faulkner and His Literary Heirs"".  It is a 400 (senior) level discussion.  For the 1st half of the semester we read Faulkner

We had a pop-midterm the class before Spring Break: 

In one sentence

Once we got back from break

Here are 25 anonymous college students' thoughts on reading the works of William Faulkner.

1. I've learned how to read past what is merely written on the page. 

2. Experimental writing is how you get the reader to *really* listen.

3. Boys like complete round things and are terrified of menstruation. 

4. It has become more clear to me than ever that whether or not the author intended an insight doesn't matter.

5. His writing method keeps the reader on his toes.

6. The idea of revealing narrative through different voices.

7. Faulkner has taught me that you aren't always supposed to understand what you are reading.

8. Until reading Faulkner

9. The same act can be seen as either courage or cowardice.

10. Be careful of what gets you from one sunrise to the next

11. The Civil War caused fractures in Southern society that will never be fully healed. 

12. In a hunting story

13. History is indebted to those who came before

14. I have finally realized how regressively obsessive the human mind can be.

15. I find that the “disturbing” aspects of character psychology exposed by Faulkner are more familiar than not

16. Always distrust your first reading

17. Don’t have a family.  I have also learned the power of deliberately deferred meaning.

18. The tension between knowing your history so you can change it and dwelling upon it is treacherous and even fatal without the application of new thought.

19. Love

20. Repetition with revision.  

21. The passage of time as something that digs down rather than moves forwards.

22. Memories are not always of the past but present with us every second.

23. I loved the juxtaposition of people and their narration.

24. History is cyclical and an always present reminder and influence

25. While discovering true knowledge is a nearly unachievable task

Much of *Moby Dick* is didactic, and even religious references are meant to ""teach"" the reader something (be it scientific, labor-oriented, spiritual, philosophical, whatever), or even to humor the reader with sarcasm and wit, or is he delivering varying meditations so as to give the reader something to think about? Sometimes Ishmael's message may overlap with that of Melville's

The narrative point of view in *Moby Dick* is not consistent, the separation may provide evidence that when Melville wanted to say something specific, he used Ishmael to do so, and when he wanted to step outside himself, he reverted to third person omniscient. Who is to say, though? 

Many scholars [here's one](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/25111433?uid=3739832&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102049168843) suggest that the switching back and forth between narration styles is a structural or modal conceit that Melville uses - a la Shakespeare - to manage the stage production of the novel

1. Proust, and he died before the last 3 volumes of In Search of Lost Time were published. His oeuvre wasn't exactly Nobel-worthy at the time of his death. And with the average age of literature laureates 63, these people died before they had had a decent shot at the prize. 

2. And even if the writer did live long enough to have had a lot of chances to win, won the Nobel, but his work has lost its relevancy, and so his reputation has faded. Basically, just because some old author's work is still read a lot today does not mean he or she deserved the Nobel; there may have been better writers around the globe at the same time whose work is no longer quite as popular as it once was. And besides, the former author still has a big readership, and I think that's better than a Nobel.

3. There's been so much anti-American bias since the award's inception! No. Just no. That bias has only been there for the past few years. The USA has actually had 10 people win the prize (Sinclair Lewis, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck, Saul Bellow, Isaac Singer, Joseph Brodsky, there are plenty of other countries with Nobel worthy candidates, but within the first 50 years of the award

Sorry for the rant, Joyce), but there have been plenty of others who never had a shot, either due to other writers at the time being considered better or thanks to an early death.

I recently finished the ebook version (thankfully we didn't have to wait as long as we did for Harry Potter on ebook.)

I really enjoyed the novel. I'm not a regular mystery reader so I did come to this more out of curiosity about Rowling's writing than anything about the blurb capturing me. I'm really glad for that and sometimes I think readers need to be ""tricked"" into tasting something outside of their preferred flavor. 

It's a solid story told very well. In this it differers slightly to my opinion of Harry Potter which I feel was an incredible story told well. The basic plot of the book could probably be found in hundreds of detective novels but the characters and way they went about their work were infinitely more interesting than finding out ""whodunnit."" 

The book is narrated by two characters. The main protagonist Cormoran Strike is the detective and is a really interesting character. I'm not familiar enough with the genre to see if he's exceptionally cliched or not but I found him extremely well written and characterised. He has two figerative hooks. Firstly that [he is an amputee after a war injury which is kept from the reader for a few chapters and is shocking when you suddenly read in a brusque tone that he removes his prosthetic. Interestingly enough this is kept from the other narrator for much longer. This sort of created an interesting subplot as we're teased with information about the injury and we get to see a disabled character very intimately and how they deal with their injury and assimilating back into life. The internal monologue re. the disability and him debating on how to tell his assistant so that she doesn't pity him is probably some of Rowling's strongest writing to date for me.](/spoiler)

Strike's second ""hook"" is that [he's the illegitimate son of a famous musician. This again is something that colors people's perception of Strike. Especially as the investigation involves Strike meeting people who not only know of his father but actually know him. While not as interesting as the disability to the reader it adds some color and texture to the store and some of the interactions Strike has.](/spoiler)

The second narrator is Strike's temporary assistant, but rather Robin is enamoured with the thrill of investigating a case. 

The meat of the book is definitely when Strike manages to track down and interview witnesses. Every conversation feels extremely different

Rowling touches on her favorite theme of classism quite often through the novel. In investigating the suicide of a supermodel

Oddly enough Rowling frequently mentions Gordon Brown which dates the story slightly and you'd think with her politics if she was trashing any PM it'd be Cameron. 

A couple of negatives that I had were that Rowling attempts to phonetically write accents which is something I feel never works well. She chooses to do this primarily with black or low class characters which feels uncomfortable at times. 

The flow of narration shifts quite abruptly between Robin and Strike which can be jarring because you're not quite sure in places where Strike's narration ends and Robin begins. 

I really look forward to Rowling's next books as I feel like the genre has gotten extremely lazy and more sensationalistic and is ready for someone like Rowling to enter the market and produce quality work that doesn't need to rely on some flashy crime or deep religious conspiracy to catch interest. Unfortunately it does prove that success in the genre is probably more based on name recognition than quality but when you have both in a writer like Rowling we as readers win. More people reading good books is always great. 

This is a huge wall of text I'm afraid. I'd be happy to answer questions on the book for people who haven't read it.

I also hated the narrator who, unfounded upper-class guilt to eject this belligerent transient from his property. He has an entire philosophical and religious crisis about some guy who wants to freeload. And yes I understand how and why he's supposed to represent depression and poverty and all that. 

The story actually amused me as a satire at first because I thought it was mocking the guilt and platonic charity of people like the narrator when faced with poverty and grief-stricken people like Bartleby. The narrator had all of this sorrow and guilt in trying to think about how he should help Bartleby and in return Bartleby just freeloads and smugly refuses to do anything.

I am also interested to hear people's insights into the different themes of the novel.  I found rebirth to be an important theme in the novel; the idea that from a persons lowest point he/she can be reborn to a whole new life.  I think this is showcased in the idea of ""you are always killed by a women, guiding them).  I also saw this theme mirrored in the concavity/convexity trash heap.  It is said that when a section of the waste is turned into energy the land becomes hyper fertile and grows a forest in a few days, kind of showcasing the out of death and waste new life can flourish idea.  

I was wondering if anyone had insight into the themes about communication and silence.  Gately is most in demand when he is unable to respond; Lenz likes walking with the other guy back from meetings because the other guy stays silent and lets him talk the whole time.  Hal goes from being able to communicate but being emotionally dead to being emotionally alive and unable to communicate.  CT communicates everything

I also thought that there was a theme that reversed the common literary theme that physical deformity meant moral deformity.  In this book it seems to be the opposite.  Mario is the most deformed character

1358117225.0,16ijij,A Re-Evaluation of DFW: The Pathos of an Author's Persona,ekantavasi,54,20,33,"David Foster Wallace is, the cartoonish characters, which makes it extremely difficult to parse what actually makes his work unique or powerful.

My working theory basically has something to do with biographical pathos -- how the depression and mania that haunts the DFW-author-persona is used to create a sometimes touching meta-narrative and how his experimentation and (maybe frequent) failures in using certain techniques also elicits reader sympathy.

The most obvious example of the latter would be Octet, depending on the reader’s mood, much like how The Depressed Person can be both comedic and tragic.

But this pathos can be traced in his other, non-narcissistic way (thinking of James Wood’s and Jon Franzen’s criticisms, mainly). But this in itself contributes to the tragic narrative of the author-persona; the man who could not connect with others, who was deeply troubled by a self-obsession so complete as to amount to solipsism.

The reason this doesn't just make for bad fiction is probably the sheer amount of effort and technical skill he dazzles us with. You can practically see the muscular tissue of his sentences straining to lift the meaning they never or are only rarely able to. He’s like a wannabe Atlas

Note 1: I've got no illusions about how interesting the question of whether or not DFW is my thing or not is (that is to say, they aren't the endpoint in mind here. I'm not trying to either destroy an idol or apotheosize a writer. I did used to be a huge DFW fan, and can certainly see the appeal of many of the techniques that I might now condemn. For example, I used to believe Everything Is Green to be a beautiful snapshot, a pure expression of extreme aching offered up without catharsis. Now I think it's sort of an amateur lit-experiment. But either way, this isn't about what I ultimately approve or disapprove of so much as it's about understanding the guy's work.

Note 2: I'm talking about the author and his biographical details as a character that is NOT meant to be the ""actual"" David Foster Wallace so much as the David Foster Wallace that lives in his audience's heads,False,,t5_2qhps,1358146673.0,,,t3_16ijij

Based on his left leaning philosophy I might guess is that it is more a satire of people who were irrationally fearful of socialism and over all I lean more towards this explanation.  I think the end of the story is somewhat in line with this.  The guy becoming a super man and then getting shot is a pretty big exaggeration.

2. What do you think was Joyce's main idea/overall agenda in this collection? 

3. It has been said that Joyce paid little or no attention to the literary fads of the time. Does that allow the work to hold up better over time?

4. What are your opinions on the cyclic nature of the collection (life cycle)?

5. Do you feel that their were any contextual reasons for the repeating themes in the collection?

6. The stories seem to have a complex relationship with religion. What do you feel was the overall consensus on the subject?

7. Discussions on a specific theme or idea (such as disillusionment, ect.) are fair game.

I think the problem with many of the adaptations is the liberties they take with the text, and just to enjoy the film for what it is, and the artistic direction the director takes it in.

I'm biased towards Macbeth and will give my favourite version of that play only:

Macbeth (1971) - Polinski adaptation which really expands on the character of Ross in an interesting way (has him as the 3rd murderer, general battle scenes, murder of the innocents scene) much of which isn't in the original text, which I think may have stemmed from the murder of his wife and unborn child by Charles Manson's disciples and also his experiences as a child when his house was raided by the SS (he said his murder of the innocents scene was inspired by his experiences as a child.) I also liked the attempts at realism, changing the soliloquies to inner-monologues. 

Throne of Blood is also a great adaptation

Another great version is the Shakespeare Re-Told version starring James McAvoy. I think the fact that it takes place in a restaurant works well to play with the idea of a clichéd feminine space (kitchen) with acts of clichéd masculinity (chopping up a pig.) I also think the Gordon Ramsey-esque King Duncan is a nice addition.

Anyways

I also didn't like how it was being taught. The majority of my classmates were hipsters who spent more time dropping acid and going to indie rock shows than actually reading the books, so basically any observation you made about the book could potentially be correct. I hated this. What the end result was that people would be talking about transgender struggles present in every literary work and the professor would simply nod and say ""that's a good point"" or something.

Should you stay away? You can but you cut your nose to spite your face that way. As long as you get any pleasure from the fiesta you have a right to go.

I remember it so vividly; I was in my 9th grade English Literature class during one of our ""silent"" reading days, eccentric hippie who had claimed to have read the entire Russian literature section of the L.A. Public Library – walk over to his aged, tacky Ghettoblaster and turn it on. Suddenly, this chilling, hypnotic music flowed out of the speakers. I continued reading, and some forty minutes later, after the music had ended, I still get chills when I think about the first time I heard “Breathe.”

Anyway, impressionable, pubescent mind, but more so in tandem than not; the overall dramatic effect was so much more poignant when I saw them as a mirror reflection of each other across two different forms of media. I noticed a marriage of themes, a sort of agreement on the state of the human condition (if that makes any sense at all), and I find that this concurrent experiencing of both works enhanced both for me.

So, what music do you think of when you think of these books?

My exposure to American writers in the latter half of the 20th century has been limited to one Palahniuk novel (Fight Club, and a clutch of short stories by David Foster Wallace, besides the more obvious genre authors - Stephen King, George R.R. Martin, etc.

Can you give me pointers where I should start with American authors? My education and reading so far has been limited largely to British authors, Fitzgerald, Margaret Mitchell).

For instance,  but is virtually unknown where I am (India). What would be a few good Philip Roth books to get into his oeuvre?

OK, and The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (in that order).

I enjoyed KotS the most and also thought it was the best of the three. It and WUBC both made ample use of ambiguity, there were just too many things left completely outstanding: 

What happened to Creta and Malta and where did they go? Did Noburo kill Malta? 

Who was the 6-year-old who saw the men burying the heart outside his window? Who were those men? Was it Nutmeg's husband's heart? Why was Nutmeg's husband killed and who killed him? 

What was the connection between Nutmeg's father's mark on his cheek

The faceless hotel employee is a friend for Toru

If Kumiko aborted the kid because the Wataya family had some evil thing that kept passing down to generations (as Toru postulated)

Why didn't Cinnamon ever speak? What was the connection between Cinnamon being mute and the muteness of the 6-year-old who witnessed the two men burying the heart?

I could keep going, but I'm just gonna focus on wrapping up these couple main ones and leave the rest wherever they fall."" 

It's not unresolved plots that I have a problem with necessarily. (Infinite Jest is my favorite book, at least.
