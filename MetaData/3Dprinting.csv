Today there're about a dozen 3D printing projects on kickstartr, and only one of them is a desktop 3D scanner, by CADScan in UK).

I used to work on industrial laser scanners and have a good knowledge of how they work, USB drivers, desktop software, calibration, etc. On the other hand, the company I worked for build their scanners in-house, so I have no experience about getting them manufactured (cheaply) overseas and imported.

For an initial device, with resolution of 0.1 mm (at lower end of scanning volume).

I estimate the cost of a low-end device will be in the $500-$1000 range. Low-end here means one camera and one laser.

EDIT: can anyone give me a rough estimate of the cost of manufacturing and shipping a cheap 3D printer at 1000 and 10000 quantities ? I think the scanner should be cheaper to manufacture than a 3D printer.

Hey everyone

The project

ProtoExchange exists on a simple bidding platform in which a visitor would request an object. The requested object would be open for bidding by modelers and/or producers. The Visitors would then choose the winning bid and the appropriate bidder would be awarded 100% of the bid winnings (ProtoExchange will not take a percentage of your hard work).

EDIT: In addition, improve, and draw inspiration from! Please check out the video on indiegogo for more information!

Anyways

If you have any questions

**TL;DR** Started a sweet

As big GoT fans, we posted a high level [instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Iron-Throne-Dock-for-your-Iphone-and-your-mobi/) detailing each step.

That tutorial garnered some bloggers’ attention ([Mary Sue](http://www.themarysue.com/iron-throne-phone-dock/), which snowballed until [Wired.com](http://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/01/game-of-thrones-smartphone-dock/) featured our phone dock in January. We were ecstatic and continued refining the phone dock design, while simultaneously accepting pre-orders.

Yesterday we received this cease and desist[letter](http://imgur.com/x6gkbzB)

edit:
here is a link to our [Website](http://nuproto.com/) and the [iThrone](http://nuproto.com/iThrone.html) page

HBO contacted us and they aren't interested in licensing it to us. They say that the charging dock idea has already been licensed to someone else.

Trying to help local forensic artist identify someone.,ebrake,25,1,16,"Since word has gotten around that Im the local go to guy for 3D printing I was approached with an unusual request from my local sheriffs department.

They have a forensics reconstruction expert that does clay modeling on human skulls to help identify the John and Jane Does.  She has such a high success rate that other police agencies have started to contact her about helping with some of their cases.

The problem is that they can not ship her human skulls that is part of evidence on the other side of the country.  So the solution that they have come up with is Resin SLA 3D prints of the skulls.

The other police department had a CAT scan preformed on a skull and sent the file down to her.  The problem is that it is not in a ""solid"" 3D format that the 3D printers use. Its in individual image slices that medical imaging software assembles to create a 3D image.

So Im trying to find a way to convert this CAT scan to a useable .STL or IGES format so that it can be accurately replicated.

Google has led me to: Mimics Innovation Suite http://biomedical.materialise.com/mis

Unfortunately I can not buy the software on their site (dont even know if I can afford it they have no listed prices) and I have received no response to my information requests.

I also came across 3D Doctor software (http://www.ablesw.com/3d-doctor) however they want over $2

So I thought I would ask the great minds of reddit.  Do you guys know another way to covert CAT scans to a 3D friendly format,False,self,t5_2rk5q,False,,,t3_17ixa1

Anyway

* You can now see stl files in 3D.  [Take a look at Mr. Alligator](http://www.bld3r.com/obj/18001?webgl=True) (may not work it [all browsers](http://caniuse.com/webgl), and to be honest, i had no idea how to get it working two weeks ago. 

* After a lot of issues

* Also, to the way blobs are stored, and a host of bug fixes. 

What I'm still working on: 

* The next major upgrade i want to add is Thing Tracker. I'm not super familiar with it

* I am also working on implementing a feature that lets you link to an etsy page for models you created. 

* Infinite scroll is coming as soon as we have more content. 

* I also want to make the whole sharing process just a bit simpler.

So, check out the site at [bld3r.com](http://www.bld3r.com/). Please, continue to let us know what you think. We really do take the feedback seriously. If you have any models you want to share, that would be awesome. ",,False,self,1372172382.0,t3_1h1esz

1363709048.0,1alkcd,Sumpod - What a nightmare,Phaelon74,23,1,15,"I was in the market for a 3D printer back in July 2012.  I went to the site that has all the currently available 3D printers side by side and viewed all the models.  I really liked the print quality of the UP (before it was Afinia for the USA) but at the end of the day I settled on the SUMPOD because of its build and the ability to CNC with it.  When I purchased the SUMPOD Big Aluminum I was given a 6-8 weeks lead time.  Fair enough.  Fast forward to last week when I just got my box.  Not my printer

My original intent was to buy a fully functional 3D printer to begin familiarizing myself with 3D printing and then to dig into it and actually build my own second printer.  Now it looks like I will be rebuilding the skeleton of a SUMPOD to something completely different.

Here is a link of the pictures I’ve taken of my currently progress and the mess of parts I have with no materials list/instructions. http://s157.photobucket.com/user/Kahlid74/library/Sumpod.  I’ve found a forum with lots of other people in the same boat as me (http://sumpod.proboards.com/) and I’ve posted a build on there.  The purpose of this post is not to complain about a purchase that has come to bite me in the ass but as a warning to anyone thinking about getting a SUMPOD.

Yes, because Reddit is an awesome tool like that.

So here's some of the basic stuff I need to know. 

-What is the best 3D printer for personal use that is a good balance with easy maintenance/reliability

-What are some of the major issues that you guys think I'll run into as a newby?

-I've noticed a lot of people say ""the novelty runs out quickly, what is the best 3D modeling software in terms of affordability and comprehension?

-In layman's terms

-Has anyone had experience or know of some sources that relate to this venture I'm about to go on? I've never heard of an average Joe just hitting the streets with a 3D printer

* The heat bed takes about 45 minutes to heat up to 95 C **IF I blast a [Space Heater](http://www.amazon.com/Lasko-754200-Ceramic-Adjustable-Thermostat/dp/B000TKDQ5C/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366132504&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=space+heater) directly onto the heat bed**. 
* 9 out of 10 times the first layer **will not stick**.  I've calibrated the bed like the solidoodle wiki page explains (as well as watching several videos on youtube explaining how to do it) and no matter what
* On at least 3 occasions, it spit out unused spool through the side of the extruder.  I'll try to get a picture if this happens again.  The ABS that was spit through the side is now wasted (and it was ALOT!)
* Literally **EVERY.SINGLE.TIME.** that the part actually **does** stick, the part will simply be pulled off of the bed and move with the head and one piece.  
* Support - it's a joke

Oh I thought of a Pro: **it's cheap**.  It only cost me $800 for the biggest disappointment of my life.  If you think about it I could have had a son that would both cost and disappoint me more.

The printers need constant maintenance and tinkering. Every single time they print something, calibration is off, filament doesn't retract, filament gets chewed up, software crashes, slices are wrong, it doesn't end. 

Someone brought in a B9 (SLA printer). The resin stinks and is toxic. Leftover resin can't be reused so every print is 10-30$. After several failed prints (calibration issues ? software issues ? who knows) it went back to where it came from.

Where is desktop 3D printing going ? 
Is it like Nano Technology

So I've been lurking the sub and saw at least a couple people interested in a review. I'm new to 3D printing but I'm willing to answer any questions.

I'm located in California so the printer was shipped internationally. The box came with pressure sensors which were tripped. The only damage looked to be superficial

Its fully assembled which is nice but definitely not ready out of the box. Comes with the necessary screws drivers for leveling the plate and some basic maintenance. Also had their glue

Support has been awesome so far, and respond quickly when I asked for supplemental information that is missing from documentation on removing the case. Replacement case was missing their brand so I think it was sent from the manufacturer. I could check but the box is all the way over there...

Their documentation isn't the best

Its a good looking piece of machinery; the owner of the company has it out in front so visitors can't help but take a look. Aesthetically

Setting the Z-gap

The Cubex software is only useful for converting .STL or .Creation files into cubex build files. I'd rant about the lack of features but I'm pretty sure it's not meant to do anything else. I've got to figure out what software to use to design stuff. Oh god

I was able to print out a few small things but only in one color. Due to the print plate I'm unable to properly align the print jets

One print jet is jammed so I need to do a lot of work on it to get the filament running properly. The steps are in the documentation

1348940908.0,10oatn,I need help getting the word out about my experience with a terrible company.  (Botmill),Exsanguinatus,24,6,7,"Settle in

*TL;DR at the beginning

January, and I find a deal on a do-it-yourself kit from Botmill.  Seems like a decent deal:  I don't have to locate my own suppliers for what is effectively a Mendel.  They tell me I'll get everything I need to assemble it, as well as a pound of plastic to work with. Hella fun to build something like this.  I mean, it's like the ultimate in Lego assembly to me.  So I make my purchase.

Almost immediately

    I'm only about 30 minutes away
    This is only the third time I've tried to get this problem resolved. The owner, and I've called most of this weekend so far.  So far, no response.  And, oh, yes.  I have troubles.
    When I last talked to Gil, and assembled extruder, as well as a new set of all the other plastic;  the reason being, if the extruder was that bad, the rest of the parts were probably crap as well.  I was shipped my parts and I got them something like a week later than I was expecting them, and lo-and-behold, I only have the extruders.  The rest of the replacements did not come.  Since I was in Florida this weekend
    Nobody's answering the phone

A little note to the readers...  Gil's already ominously informed me that our communications are private and should not be posted anywhere.  My words are my own

Obviously, either.  I didn't think about it during assembly, so I didn't complain about it early on.  In the end, I had to put something together to handle power myself.  They also sent me an additional heated print bed, but there's no instruction on how to assemble it, nor was there any power supply for it, either.

It took ten days, and the parts were still shit...  so now they'd set up a bunch of printers themselves and were printing out parts as fast as they could...  and that I'd have to wait for them.  By this point, it's not mid-March.

Finally.  March 28th comes around...  MARCH FUCKING 28th!  Two months after my money was withdrawn.  Let that sink in a little....  I'm contacted by one of their employees confirming my delivery address and am given a tracking number later that day.

Assembly finally starts.

Different extruder entirely.  That's ok...  I can figure this out.  Turns out I have the hardware for the ""Adrian's Extruder"" type

April 12, and the printer's together except for wiring.  I've been in constant communication with their ""tech"" guy sorting out various issues...  In reality, I've had to figure out damn near everything on my own, as they still had pretty shitty assembly information available.  Wiring was highly entertaining, as I had to track down the steppers they sent me online and figure out what wire is supposed to go to what pin.  The information I was given by their support guy was no fucking help at all.

So, but I'm not concerned with that at the moment.  I'm trying to align each axis and make sure my machine is squared up.  This leads to a great deal of frustration, as no matter what I do I can't keep the print nozzle a constant distance from the print bed while aligning the z axis.  I'm not a machinist, so I'm at a little bit of a loss as to why this would be, since I appear to have done everything correctly in terms of assembly for now.  Several things happen, such as my over-tightening of an adjustment screw on the bed and snapping one of the plastic pieces....  I'm tired, frustrated, and I set the whole thing down for a couple months.  I'm not too worried about it, the whole process has been draining.

Fast forward to September.  I've brought the printer home with me to show my dad and request his assistance.  He's done just about everything in life.  He can fix this shit if I can't.  I explain my issues, and the end of September by now, but I try my luck anyway with an email.  No response.  Only to be expected.  I get the bed decked to within 5 thousandths of an inch of flat for about $40....  investing more of my own time and money on this project.

Finally, and the only easy part of this whole discussion with Botmill takes place.  My extruder's been being really weird, so I go to change out the brass nozzle.  While disassembling it, the thermistor in the heater block just falls apart.  I'm kicking myself in the ass at this point, and contact Botmill.  They kindly ship me out a new, although completely different, replacement free of charge.  Finally

December, so I'm trying to use the regular channels for assistance.  Two submitted tickets to support and about two weeks later, no one's contacted me back and my support tickets are gone.  Obviously, I'm confused, so I try emailing Gil Mayron again.  I'm put in touch directly with support.

Suffice to say, and the recommended temperature settings pretty much burn the plastic.  I'm trying to figure this out with their support, but nothing I can get out them seems to do the job.

I use the same software. I get copies of their settings. The GCode produced by the software yields nothing useful.  I try the demo GCode files available...  Nothing ever prints right because temperatures are inconsistent and the first layer of plastic is shit because all the plastic melted out of the extruder nozzle by the time it's gotten to the correct starting position.  The only thing that every printed close to correct was code supplied by Botmill

Fast forward to June.  I've had a temporary room-mate and no room for my disaster of a printer.  He's moved out, two of my steppers seize up sold as soon as power is supplied to the printer!  I contact support, get basic troubleshooting advice which, as someone whose worked in computer technical support, is pretty much no help (unplug everything and plug it in again...  Really?).  So I'm still stuck with a non-functional printer.  Just more non-functional than ever.

I make it August 8th, but it would be nice if I could get at least a *partial* refund, since I have a long documented stream of issues...  but I'm not holding out on those hopes.  Mr. Mayron finally responds with the most condescending answer possible: ""Other people have gotten our product to work.  No refunds, no returns, no nothing.""  Thus, he implies that all of my whole string of problems are entirely my fault.  *MY FUCKING FAULT.*  Bullshit.

Now I'm mad.  I go hunting for other information and come across whole swaths of conversations on the RepRap forums, now I'm livid.  I demand a full refund for his shitty attitude and link him the conversations I found on that forum.  Things only went downhill from there.

I may have to look into taking them to small claims court.  If anyone's still reading by this point

What I am planning to do is start small, and then build up to printing an interesting object of their own design. The ultimate goal would be to impart the (I think) significant sensation of moving an idea --&gt; to design --&gt; to actual object. I should note that in total the course will only have 15 class hours (5 classes, three hours each). 


The printers the course will use are the Thing-O-Matic


The modeling program I am planning to teach them to use is Blender. I think this works for a few reasons:

* All of the computers at the college have Blender 2.5+ already installed and ready to use.
* I think that while Blender has a steep initial learning curve
* I am kind of a FOSS guy
* Also


I have a reasonable amount of experience teaching a variety of art and traditional printmaking courses, I would greatly appreciate any input on the course as described, or possible pitfalls to avoid when teaching 3d-modeling and printing!

A red blood cell has a diameter of 8 µm (8*10^-6 of a meter).  That's a factor of only 12.5 difference. Maybe soon we could extrude human cells like ketchup out of little tubes.

Anyway
Only issue could be they don't have a lot of available colors but well this could be one of the reasons why they are one Indiegogo.

Quality is a big factor for me

What they say:
&gt;High quality 3D Printed cases with switchable panels
&gt;ALL SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS: It doesn’t matter which device you have
&gt;HIGHEST QUALITY: We have selected the best materials and developed a unique way of combining 3D Printing with top quality coating to deliver optimal protection

May be I'm not objective due to the fact I backed the project, the quality seems to be really reliable this time. 

I really am a tech addict/enthusiast and hope we'll be able to create what we want from 3Dprinting.

1. I'd have to print it in stages and snap the pieces together.

2. I'll probably need a more robust frame to build it all around

3. I'll leave spaces for locks/hinges etc.

4. I'll be sealing and waterproofing the whole thing.

I realize asking 'what's the cheapest bestest no maintenance-est printer' is like asking what car will never break down or what's better

  About me: I use a Windows PC. I'm versed in 3d modeling and design. I'm comfortable building computers, so I'd rather avoid something that could be great if only you have to solder in some new components if possible.

  About what I intend to use it for: Practically, craft shows and the like. For fun, for printing replica props such as the Portal gun or swords and costumes such as Iron Man helmets or stormtrooper armor components.

  My (preferable) criteria:

- I'm comfortable spending around a grand. Obviously the best deal is best

- I understand that at this price range I will not not be printing amazing, acetone, assembling, painting etc. I don't expect to go from the printer to a sale, rather use it as a tool on the road to a finished product.

- Since I'm using it as a tool in a series of steps, calibrating, tinkering side of the experience. I know that it's still in it's infancy in the consumer space and I will be doing maintenance and calibrating here and there, but I'd like as much of a 'out-of-the-box' experience as possible.

- A build area of 40x40x40 feet. Just kidding. Preferably around 8 inches cubed. I plan on printing larger models in sections and assembling them afterwards

- ABS plastic for durability

- I'm in the US so I'd prefer the same for support

  I've looked a bit [here](http://www.3ders.org/pricecompare/3dprinters/) but I'd like some real input. So far I'm leaning towards a Solidoodle 3 due to it's build area/price point/construction, and from what I've read they work well with their customers.

  I'm also considering the [Robo3d](http://www.robo3dprinter.com/products/robo-3d-abs-model-fully-assembled) for it's print bed and price

  And lastly I toyed with holding out for/investing in the [Gigabot](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/re3d/gigabot-3d-printing-this-is-huge) but the price, and still being in the Kickstarter phase deterred me.

These printers may not be as good as I think they are going to so I guess I wont know till I get one but most of the printers say they can keep accuracy to 0.2 of a mm which is enough for about 60% of the products I've had to make out of plastics.
Failing that I know a lot of the companies I've worked for in the past sometimes get scale models created of their new products and I was thinking it may be a faster way of creating desk size prototypes of offshore products to show off and possibly sections of equipment for training purposes ext.

1. You do NOT need a heated bed
McMaster Carr PN 8474K141, 8474K171)

2. Turn off the Rep 2's cooling fan

3. On the Replicator 2 print at 248C. This is the correct temp for the best layer adhesion on this printer with Nylon 618.

4. To account for the strings you need to change 'Retraction Distance' to 6mm (under the Dimension tab in Skeinforge settings)

5. Change your Preheat temp to 248C as well under the printer's Info and Settings menu.  This is for loading and unloading.  Remember to change this back when you go back to PLA.

6. It is highly recommended that you upgrade your extruder to one of the spring tension models from Thingiverse.  This makes a world of difference for Nylon AND PLA.  I have not tried printing Nylon with the stock (delrin plunger) extruder.

For less than a half year ago I was sitting on the fence and pondering on getting a 3D printer or not. I spent quite some time reading and researching about 3D printers out there before I decided to get one.  I had many potential printers in my mind but ended up with the Makergear M2 and had my first successful print attempt yesterday! 
So here is for you all fence sitters out there; some unboxing pictures and soon more.

I am, but that doesn't mean I want to spend that much either since this will be mostly a Christmas present/student loan purchase.

So

The models:

* Star Vase - a simple vase. Price: $0.99
* Nexus 7 Stand. Price: $0.99
* Guardian Catapult: $2.99

These prices seem to be way lower than what most people charge ($45 for a vase desgin?!?!?!)

The sites that I submitted to:

* http://3dburrito.com/
* http://3dlt.com/
* http://www.layerbylayer.com
* http://3dprintingmodel.com/
* http://www.ponoko.com/

If I can bitch for a minute, picture styles, tags, categories, etc.

The sites that I did NOT submit to:

* cubify.com - only does physical models
* shapeways.com - only does physical models
* fabme.it - does not accept models as far as I could tell
* azavy.com - too small
* createthis.com - too small and poor quality models
* cuboyo.com - too small 
* grain3d.com - too small
* turbosquid.com - not 3d printing oriented
* cgtrader - not 3d printing oriented
* grabcad - not 3d printing oriented

So, or you've bought or sold models successfully) please let me know and I will consider uploading my models there. 

If there's any other suggestions I'm open to them. I'm not expecting to get rich
