Not that it probably matters to those here, along with terrorists with the intelligence to operate them, are more available then we would like to believe.  

However

Ziplock bags - 3 small and 3 gallon size.
They take up almost no space, and I have seen first hand a gallon size used to treat a sucking chest wound.

Zipties - at least 10
Once again

Baby wipes - 
No soldier would ever be in the field without them.  Use to field wash, mosquitos and other bugs are attracted to strong scents.

Waterproof bag - 1

Line your Bug Out/Get Home bag with one to keep all your clothing and equipment dry.  It's standard operating procedure in the Army but I have seen to many civilians neglect this.  Worse case senario

Contractor Bag - 3

Available at any hardware store.  Extremely versatile and lightweight.
You can even cut it to make a tarp.  

Duct tape - 1 roll

I prefer the black gorilla tough tape

Headlamp

An absolute necessity!  I rarely use my flashlight, we ONLY use red light.

Magnesium Fire starter

If you absolutely need a fire

A couple other notes

Watch cap and gloves

It gets cold at night....

Of course, get a decent bag.  My assault pack, a Spec-Ops T.H.E has been through 3 deployments and though a little dirty, has never ripped or torn even with the abuse I have put it through.

I haven't been entirely satisfied with any of the ones that I have seen. They all seemed to be missing something. This is my Get Home Bag (GHB). It could easily double as a BOB if I had to use it that way. It stays in my vehicle at all times. Since I had to pull it out of the car to update it for warmer weather I decided to completely disassemble it and take pictures.

My GHB is designed to be able to get me home from about 250 miles away if I have to walk. There isn't enough food to really last the walk home from the maximum range but I expect that I would be able to supplement that along the way. Even if I can't there is enough food that I wouldn't starve by any stretch.

There are a few items which are not pictured which I have with me whenever I am traveling. The primary reason that I travel is because I am a rifle marksmanship instructor for [Appleseed](http://appleseedinfo.org). Since they are technically not a part of the bag itself I am only going to list them: hiking boots, 9mm handgun and holster. I would usually have a rifle of some variety with me as well. Other things I would have are a book for reading and my Every Day Carry (EDC) items like my smartphone, money and Advil.

It is a deficiency that there are a few items that are not contained within my bag at all times. I

If you want to build a get home bag try walking home in the summer on a nice day. (bring water)  Have a friend or spouse ready to come pick you up if you fail.  Use the experience of walking home to help see what you might need.  Winter or summer, and a fleece.  Build your kit around this and you can travel much farther and easier than a trash bag and condom will get you.

If you need a BOB then start with 50-60L pack not some 15L day pack.  Buy a decent three season tent with a full fly


A good quality non suspension bike is a great investment.  A small child bike trailer is also a good investment if you need to carry supplies for more than one person or for a longer journey.  Rear baskets or paniers are also an option.

Container gardening isn’t only for savvy urban gardeners and folks with limited space to grow, just tip the container over!

After extensive research to plan his own potatoes-in-a-barrel



1. Select and prepare a container
You’ll need to pick out a container such as a 50-gallon trash barrel or one of those half whiskey barrel planters. Alternatively, or is okay to cut holes in. Next you’ll want to clean your container with a mild bleach solution to get out any of the nasties that have been lingering in there.

Good drainage is critical for the cultivation of healthy potatoes so you’ll want to cut or drill a series of large drainage holes in the bottom and bottom sides of your container. Alternatively



2. Choose a variety and plant potatoes
Seed potatoes can usually be found at nurseries early in the growing season, the side with the most buds facing up, and putting them in a cool light room out of direct sunlight to sprout. Putting the tubers in an open paper bag can have this same effect.

Fill in the bottom of your container with about 6 inches of loose planting mix and compost. You’ll want to use a planting mix with a peat moss-like soil amendment like this product made from repurposed coconut husks, making certain to leave plenty of space between each cube. You can use the whole potato but I like to cut the potatoes into 1 to 2-inch cubes for planting. Loosely backfill the potatoes with another 6 inches of your soil and compost mix and water to dampen soil. Keep the soil damp at all times but be careful not to overwater.



3. Add more soil
When they have about 6 to 8 inches of foliage


4. Harvest the potatoes
After about 10 weeks or until the plants flower and start to yellow



Other tips to grow bushels of barrel potatoes
After the first harvest
Bush beans are a great companion plant for potatoes.
Instead of using soil
Experiment with different containers
If the above steps aren’t sufficient

I tend not to use the term ""prepper"" because of the negative connotation that it has earned lately but I like to think that I'm prepared for the foreseeable disasters. I've chosen a home with enough land to grow food and raise small animals while also having direct access to much larger hunting grounds but also out of flood plains while still being on a major artery in my area which assures easy access and near constant electricity. I still like to think that I prepare for the worst though. Right now, and the well pump to provide water. I'm also getting ready to store about three months of fresh water on hand in the basement and install solar and wind power on my property to diversify my electricity source. I don't keep nearly as much food on hand as I'm sure many of you do but I keep far more non-perishable items on hand than the normal person. 

So here is my case in point. We got SLAMMED by the blizzard this year but I didn't even bat an eyelash. I wasn't worried about power loss or my ability to leave my house for days at a time. I looked around and couldn't think of a single thing I needed to go to the store for that I didn't already have in abundance. I recall the ice storm and I'm currently prepared to survive that and more. 

Point being. who here is surviving for TEOTWAWKI and who is preparing for those instances that some of us seem to have to face once or twice a year lately?

In that post, and if it's positive, maybe launch this thing for real.

So

- You promise to give me your feedback. You can post here if you want

- The pack will be sent in the packaging of our non-profit (I am personally covering the cost of it)

- You should be a somewhat frequent poster in preppers or a similar subreddit.

I'll pick a few people (5 or so) from the people who post here asking to be a reviewer

There are pros to us and I'm sure cons as well, and it will help fund a hunger relief charity. It's exciting.

If you want to be a reviewer

Thanks!

**EDIT 1:20pm EST:** Thanks for the responses; I have responded to each person

Here is a picture of one of the packs: http://i.imgur.com/1S2UHOo.jpg

You will see that these packs are a combination of: Rice, and a Vitamin/Seasoning powder. ***We didn't mean to do it, but it turns out that these are actually vegan.***

Anticipated pros: tastes good, portable, low sodium. 

Anticipated cons: lack of variety

***I will message everyone when I ship them out***

This was my first time using a common home-storage technique I learned about from this sub for long term food storage. My only deviation was instead of using one 2000cc O2 absorber (the recommended amount for 5 to 6 gallon buckets)

Up until this point, and cornmeal. I'd possibly use these for our own food variety and as a little barter in a total collapse, but more likely for friends and family in a short term disaster.

I plan on filling a couple more buckets the weekend after next

PS: I did this yesterday and will be opening the buckets after work to make sure the absorbers have removed the O2 and compressed the contents properly after work today. Will update later.

Unless you have unlimited resources or a crystal ball

But I don't see preppers doing this at all.  I see preppers preparing for the extremely unlikely event of societal collapse

To me, and they've mapped out exactly how they'll distribute the winnings among friends and family with minimal tax exposure.  They're determined not to be one of these chumps that blows through their windfall and winds up worse off than before they won.

Meanwhile their day to day financial situation is a mess

My dad is a prepper.  His pickup truck is outfitted to withstand an EMP and he maintains an extensive aquaponic system in his garage.  But he doesn't have a fire extinguisher, and he does not carry disability insurance—let alone critical illness, organ transplant, or any of the other lines of coverage available.  All of these seem like things that someone who is committed to preparedness would prioritize above preparing for a nuclear winter or some such.

He had a pocket kit that was much more basic

Spool of fishing line

12 feet of parachute cord (12 strands in the cord

Small knife

Pump flashlight

Compass

GPS

Fishing hooks (mostly because they don't take up space and could have a lot of uses)

Space blanket (for warmth and signaling)

Garbage bags

Signal mirror

Flint and magnesium

Steel wool

A handful of fire starter sticks

Lighters

Signal tape

Small stove that can run off fuel or diesel.

Tea bags (he said the first thing you need to do while you're sitting on the shore watching your plane sink into the water is make some tea and take a deep breath)

Water filter and tablets

Marine radio with spare batteries

26 year old jerky

**He also had an awesome homemade ham radio made out of an Altoids can.** He has a homemade key he uses to transmit morse code through a friggin' Altoids can!

Water/windproof matches (they're not as useful as a few lighters

A foot of Heavy duty aluminum foil crumpled up

Whistle

Bear ""mace"" (I put that in quotes because it's smaller than normal bear mace

Flare gun with a strip of 8 flares (one of which we shot off into the water

Two parachute flares

Gauze in a zip loc

Small roll of duck tape he sawed down to a third of the original width

**A badass radio antenna launcher he made out of a slingshot and fishing reel.** He has a sinker on the end of the line

I don't have any problems with people supporting themselves but I think we need to revisit the idea of blog-spam and make it clearer and more obvious what our rules are. Unfortunately not everyone who is trying to make a go of it has the time or interest to participate in reddit the way that reddiquette suggests is proper. Reddit is a terrible way to get a blog off of the ground unless you win the lottery and go viral.

I am looking for suggestions as to how to manage the problem and have a proposal for consideration:

---

Owners of web-stores which have blogs or post articles of some kind can post once per week linking their own content if they give the /r/preppers community a dedicated discount code for their site. The submitted links must be to a to an article which would be of general interest to the community.

If a submitter does not have a web-store they are permitted to submit one article per week to their own content.

If either of those classes of submitter breaks the rules and it is verified they will receive one warning. A second violation will result in being banned from /r/preppers.

---

The rules will be linked in the side-bar to a wiki article containing the rules. If this change is approved everyone will start off from a clean slate.

Of course

Your input on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

I want to start by saying I just found this subreddit and I hope this kind of post isn't out of line. I just spent the better part of an hour reading a bunch of interesting links submitted recently and they have actually been quite enlightening for an hours' time

Now, etc. too much. I honestly always felt his desire to stock up on weaponry, ammo, etc. was a little overboard, since I assumed his only motivation for doing so came from zombie-related media. Recently, though, I've realized that he just has that natural propensity to be a ""prepper."" Once we were engaged, if need be, to start) preparation. I guess now I just see the benefit of being better prepared for an emergency and of satiating his desire to be prepared. My hang up is that I don't have the same innate urge at this point because it doesn't seem overly practical in our current situation. We live in a small one-bedroom rental that we won't be staying in much longer (8 months max). We're considering moving to a larger urban area to (hopefully) help ourselves out in terms of career advancement since we've been very limited because of where we live. Also

My main concern is that I don't know where to start since we won't be staying in our house (which, although I fully understand waiting for a future date defeats the purpose of preparing for an emergency that could happen any time. So my question for you all is (also serves as a **TL;DR**): **for someone very new to the idea of prepping who is interested in learning more about how to get started, what would be the best course of action for me and my husband, who I've recently discovered is a prepper at heart, in our current circumstances?**",,False,t5_2riow,True

I've been hovering for a while

Between /r/preppers

But I have to start somewhere

So my plan is to make my house livable without power for at least 1 week without needing to leave for supplies.

It is just my wife and I

We have a house (in central Massachusetts) with a pellet stove

As far as the house goes:

Setup the generator to power the house.  Right now I have to run extension cords and can't run the furnace off it.

Insure a supply of pellets &amp; make sure the oil is at least 1/2 full at all times.   

Keep (and rotate) gasoline

Prepare enough material to board up the house due to hurricanes/tornadoes

Test the backup sump pump.   If the primary fails, etc.

Equipment:

Secondary cooking source since I don't want to rely on the electric stove as it would draw so much power.

I would guess a camping stove with bottled fuel makes the most sense

Again

Light sources:  flashlights and lanterns.  I'll avoid candles as a fire hazard.

Fire extinguisher.

Tarps.

Shovels

(Chain) saw as we do have trees that might come down that can be a hazard.

As this is home, jackets, etc shouldn't be an issue.  Neither is entertainment.

Food/water:

Store bottled water for 2 people for a week.  Additionally

Store enough food for 2 people.  Make this part of our normal consumption to keep stocks as fresh as possible.

Account for a means of personal hygiene.   I'm not terribly sure what this is yet....baby wipes?  Perhaps a ""camping shower""?  We do have a tub

I am also planning on basic first aid/CPR classes and other ""survival"" courses to help get me ready for camping/fire starting/cooking

Does this sound reasonable?  Am I overlooking any significant areas?  Anything else I should be working on?

Thanks preppers!

1. Always keep at least a half tank of gas in your vehicles. (I know this costs money but you have to refill your tank eventually) Just make the 1/2 line the new E line.
2. Keep up with your dishes and laundry at home. If you're bugging in and need to conserve water you don't want to waste it doing these menial chores. I know you could always let them sit but if I'm holed up for a long period I'd rather not have a molding pile of dishes clogging my sink or dishwasher.
3. Practice with the gear you do own. Got a tent in that BOB? great! have you ever set it up? in darkness? I've seen too many videos of preppers' gear inventory and everything is still in the package.

It seems like in a SHTF scenario

It doesn't seem like a solid way to go for a number of reasons.  These folks are loners

1.  No matter how long you hole-up, how can we work together for any extended period of time?

2.  Maybe the show doesn't show it, and you made great efforts to hide from others where your bug-out base is; you have that much money and time to invest in survival skills that you learned from others, and you met others learning as well.  All people and contacts that might be useful when a SHTF scenario occurs.

3.  I honestly think when the SHTF scenario happens, a lot of us are gonna die.  Those that survive *have* to find a group.  And these groups are going to have to figure out how to work together.  Imagine if after 6 months, or a year or two, some guy just walks into you camp.  You ask, ""where did you come from.""  They tell you they've been eating franks and beans for the last year while you and your group struggled.  You're not really a guy I want in my group.  We've all been living off the land and helping each other as best we could, and you've been in some post-apocalypse Taj-Mahal worrying about where to store you feces and refuse.

Granted I'm an Montanan and I don't make a lot of money for a SHTF shelter...  But I *am* a Montanan.  I know a bit about harsh elements, and a bit about where I should bug-out too.  But being a Montanan means that there's going to be a lot of places to go and restart, and we can do it; we've done it before under hostile condidtions (be it the elements or enemies).  But you're never an expert at anything, you always have a lot to learn, and there's always someone better that can teach you.  And if you're gonna survive, you need them.

And I know a miniscule bit about survival, and I can appreciate their realism...  but the realism is flawed, because it's a black/white issue for them, and there is no such thing as a black/white issue.

At home, in a SHTF scenario, I really don't want to defend it.  We can go make the same thing elsewhere together.

The garden and the rabbits and the pigeons and such would be a decent short-term way to ""Bug-*in*

So I'm bummed that the ""prepper"" outfit seems to act (at least on television) like I'm your enemy, as little as I know about ""prepping"", you have to assume that everyone is the enemy, and we're not and we're not because it's a shit long-term plan for rebuilding.

A little bit about how this started and the concept behind the site. It really is a merging of several interests for me, and my long interest in prepping, particularly self sufficiency and security being my big ones. So I got the idea in my head one day and just decided to go for it.   


When you visit the site, bizarre, practical or fun, and really get people's imagination running and get them talking. Also, I feel that prepping should be for everyone. Regardless of who you are, where you live, how much you earn and so on


A little about my interest in prepping- as you can tell, even for a couple days, you will be a lot happier if you have what you need than if you don't.  And also, I find security really interesting too. How can you make your house/car more secure against break ins, protect yourself when you're going for a walk , and so on. Living in a big city, I've heard and seen a lot of crazy things happen to people.

The proliferation of social media and image hosting sites is both a boon and a curse to preppers.

Boon as it allows easy contact

With off line tools like jpeg-snoop and browser plugins like Jeffrey Friedl's Exif viewer it has become trivial to extract and view the information embedded by default in most smartphone images.  Armed with this information a simple Google maps query can reveal not only the location but also provide images of the location in question.  That picture you took of your preps in your retreat

Aha, phone number and address hmm should I copy that down.

Wow

How can you avoid these issues.  For pictures either disable location information on your smartphone or save them to your computer first then open them in mspaint and save them as a new picture.  This will remove all EXIF data including location information.

The article isn't for any publication

I hope this isn't too assuming or intrusive in posting this here.  I am very interested in your culture and would really love to learn more about it.

Finally

1. What do you do

2. How long have you been prepping for?

3. Why did you start prepping?

4. How exactly do you prep, etc. do you store away and what additional trainings or education have you sought?

5. Is there any specific calamity that you are prepping for?

6. Have you seen the show ""Doomsday Preppers"" on NatGeo? Do you feel that it is a fair presentation of preppers?

7. In my research into this

8. Is there anything you would find appealing about living in a post-apocalyptic world?

9. Do you feel that you're missing out on other things in life by spending so much time prepping?

10. What do you think about zombie and other post apocalypse movies? Any favorites? Any that you absolutely hate?

I write as well. A minor character in a story I'm writing seemed to take the forefront and I've been running with it. I can't quite get the mentality of 'doomsday' people down. This is where I need some help. I'm asking these questions because while I have a base for this character he was originally written from a perspective that he is insane. (don't take offence) Since I am assuming that you are not indeed insane I am looking for other motives / reactions to situations.

`The questions may come off as aggressive or sound like their intent is to wind you up. That is not why I'm asking. I prefer to be blunt though. This is the internet and I think you can handle it.`

* What would your response be if someone lumped your mentality or world views with other fringe groups like the Westburo Baptist church

* How important is the guns issue? i.e. could someone with no guns etc be considered a prepper (from other preppers perspective.) That is say a hippy commune where all the food is local grown and sourced etc etc.

* How would you personally respond if for some reason you had to take a mental health exam or met with a mental health professional and afterward they told you (accused you) of wanting a disaster to happen so that you could be an important person?

* Do you secretly wish the above would happen?

* How do you look at 'normal' people. This includes those living paycheck to paycheck as well as those who have emergency funds and retirement funds, or months of food, or clean water.

* Do you ever watch shows / read / or meet people who make you cringe and say: ""They give all preppers a bad name."" Does this happen far more often than not? (meaning that you personally don't agree with most other preppers) The point of this questions is to get a feel of the prepper community. i.e. are they fairly like minded or just a group of people with highly different goals / attitudes.

* Do you own guns? Do you know the ""weak points"" at local shops / grocery stores / gas stations / etc so if you had to steal or attack the building you could.

* Do you consider yourself Christian? If so what is your stance on those that come looking for food after whatever your planning for happens?

* How do you feel when someone attacks your beliefs with laughter and total disregard. That is like an asshole adult might handle a child that tells them Santa is real or a biologist might deal with a parent who honestly does not understand evolution.

* Lastly how much time do you spend doing prep stuff that other people don't. So everyone does dishes or takes out trash. If you were to do this differently than others

So for the past 2 years, however behind a 6 ft fence and prickly blackberry barrier, the backyard is where abundance flows!


I had to consider all factors when growing food; protein


For protein, filbert, beechnut, hickory, and pecans. Each species of nut....I planted 3 different cultivars (for all fruit/nut trees) By planting different cultivars, this greatly assists in the production and pollination. 


I did the same for all my fruit trees (too many to list). 3 cultivars for each fruit. The production after 2 years is outstanding!


I also planted a whole raised garden bed with Amaranth and couscous.
I have many raised gardens, I like to ensure the plants have some shade. It really improves the flavor for everything except tomatoes. All of my beds were built with hugulculture in mind; this is the 3rd year of the program, and it is amazing how much water you save utilizing this!   

Regarding carbohydrates, and beans. You get a LOT more carbs per sq ft with potatoes then corn, and taters need a LOT less water and fertilizer. 


In a pinch, head out to the local park and pick up as many breeding pairs of ducks/geese as you can! You will have to quarantine and medicate, however in a closed chicken run, you could raise a large flock for your freezer pretty quickly.

May be too soon

If you keep any surplus of ammunition, I will explain.  The number of AR15 variant rifles sold over the past few years has exploded with numerous new manufacturers and it has become one of the most popular rifles in the US.  

Standard AR15s shoot a .223 Rem or 5.56mm NATO,000 round cases go for $1,500.00+.  So naturally, people move to reloading supplies, but they too have become nearly impossible to find and prices have spiked as well.

My initial thoughts were that the market would adjust itself and we'd see a massive flood of cheap Russian and Serbian imported ammunition.  But so far I have not seen it.

Any changes experienced by anyone in the US?

I say all the militants, uni-bomber types and anyone else on the fringe; Why not form units or squads that operate as a seek and destroy boar killing paramilitary units.

Imagine units of 8-10 soldiers entering boar infested areas and hunting them. Living in the bush in these ""deployments""

There probably isn't a better training tool for developing communication and stalking technique. You could deploy in full battle rattler and actually go out in the bush and kill shit. People pay for boar eradication sometimes and if the boar meat isn't edible

I know preppers aren't ""gun nuts"" or anything

edit spelling

edit2: I could see this becoming an actual sport if enough people were interested. Teams have a time allowance to hunt with whatever techniques they want. Points awarded for kills or total weight. Would make a great Tv show as well. Hunting at it's pinnacle. Gun lovers and hunters love to argue which gun is the best or what round is better. Here is where you put them to the test in the field. 

AND..how awesome would it be to have a marine team, civilian teams, girl teams. The possibilities are endless. Help show America guns can be fun when used safely and for the right reasons.

I found this company by one of those ""Like"" giveaways a lot of military gear companies have been doing on Facebook lately. I wasn't aware of it, so I figured I would give his company a try.

I had wanted to buy some survival bracelets for a while, as I can't carry my Glock at work or a few other places, and wanted some protection for these times. I figured this would fit the bill. I had the [small monkey fist with the 3/4"" bearing](https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/58637_450801934969587_782828479_n.jpg) made for my girlfriend and the [6"" tethered monkey fist with the 1 1/4"" bearing](https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/540860_451575414892239_1072771903_n.jpg) made for myself for this purpose. I am currently looking for a couple smooth metal rings to loop the handle straps on so that I can attach them to a key ring. I don't want to just use a key ring, as I am afraid the key ring would snag and fray the paracord. If anyone knows where I can find such a thing, let me know. I made the keychain for me with the 1 1/4"" bearing just to add a little ""oomph"" to any force I could apply with it, and it seems to do the trick. Decent weight that I'm able to swing quickly.

I keep the [small knife](https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/481219_451277891588658_949683240_n.jpg) in my Get-Home-Bag so that when work sends me on trips, and sharp enough to cut anything I need it to.

The [Double Monkey Fist](https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/303673_452105778172536_1318983027_n.jpg) is also in my get home bag. I used one of my [belay devices](http://www.amazon.com/Black-Diamond-Device-Assorted-Colors/dp/B000S8WOOY/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360307362&amp;sr=8-8&amp;keywords=belay+device) as a handle and it seems to work pretty well. [(Picture Here)](http://i.imgur.com/whsrKtS.jpg) With the amount of weight out on the end of this, the weight of these 2 large bearings seems to deform the paracord pattern some. Not enough to let the bearings slip out or anything, but it doesn't look as nice when you're done. Not that big of a deal to me, though. I'll probably buy another one of these, but get the 3/4"" bearings in it instead to be able to swing it a bit faster. 

The bracelets are just basic bracelets, and functional. I'm not a big jewelry type person, so it took a bit to get used to wearing a bracelet. I might buy a blue one in addition to the ones I have to satisfy my OCD for when I wear blue clothing (the gray and copper look odd, and my work is formal enough that if it looks odd like that, someone's going to mention it.)

Where things get messy is buying a gun for a gift, in the state I live in this is legal, some states it is not. I could grow tired of a gun and sell it to someone, anyone, without any background check (it is your responsibility to make sure they are of legal age, and to cover yourself you should have some sort of bill of sale written up).

So

&gt; an unlicensed individual may make a “firearm” as defined in the GCA for his own personal use

I then did some Google-Fu and came across [Ares Armor](http://aresarmor.com/) that sold 80% complete AR-15 lowers

So

Ares Armor also have [this video](http://youtu.be/30i_6awxEG4) as a general tutorial on it. Remember this may not be legal in your state,False,self,t5_2riow,False,,,t3_133dcb

I've been working with a startup based out of New Orleans.  We've created an online software tool (not yet live) that helps people with disaster preparedness

- upload and *securely* store personal documents, insurance information, and pictures of valuables like art or other possessions

- create evacuation plans with a map interface

- send free SMS messages to anyone

- receive alerts for your area (e.g. severe weather)

and more. 

There is also a social networking component

1. A tree lands on your car during a storm.  With this tool

2. Massive local power outages

There are some other components to this software, but also maintain communication with loved ones in times of crises.  Further, it quickens the return to normal by facilitating recovery after a disaster.  The tool can be used by individuals or by businesses. 

We have one of the largest US retailers on board to put this in their store

* This is what it is:
http://cd3wd.com/download/index.htm
* It's a pretty huge file if you have to download it yourself. You would be getting a serious of zip files
* These are multiple ISO files in one package. You must know how to mount an ISO file as a virtual drive. Windows users need extra (free) software to do this. Mounting an ISO file is built-in to a Mac and Linux. 
* On the ISO files are mostly PDF files. You will need a PDF reader also. 
* In the continental  US postage is free. 
* I can try to ship internationally. It might cost extra for postage.

Family member has a decent amount of $ coming available and I'm advising to put some into physical gold and silver.

In the past I visited a gold/sivler jewelry pawn type coin store and the guy said something about the difference between buying retail

Does anyone know the amounts, I suspect it not unlikely to happen again sooner or later : (
