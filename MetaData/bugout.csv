Felt confident in my gear. Grabbed my bags and headed to the basement. Lights went out. I couldn't even find a flashlight.

There were a couple of obvious fully kitted tear away EMT pouches on the outside. Swedish Wildlife Hatchet, bunch of random 'survival' shit all handy. But Where the fuck was my flashlight or headlamp? or anything I needed at the moment? I couldn't tell you. It was a mess. I was embarrassed at myself. It was obvious I had fucked myself over. 

The Tornado hopped over us. Literally. By few houses. Then left. Then I get a call from my parents. All of there windows were blown out

But I had no time. And I needed essential stuff. 

The pack has spent its time sitting in my office

This was a giant wake up call for me. Never will it be likely that I'll be bugging out and arrive at a place to set up camp, purify water, etc. It's going to be something simple, like a tornado, or a hurricane, or an earthquake, or whatever you have in your neck of the world. 

So. Test your pack. I never ran a drill. I walked around with it to make sure it was the right weight. But I never tested finding something quickly. Test your memory/knowledge of your pack. Make an inventory, or you need to familiarize yourself with with it is.

1343888786.0,xjvb8,The realistic bugout bag,pacifica09,60,9,12,"I've had a bugout bag for a while.  The first few versions followed the standard format: a mixture of hiking gear but heavier on tools and self defence.  Then a while ago while reassessing my bag I had a realization; bugging out is probably not going to mean going into the woods for a few days.  The things you will likely need are much more run of the mill and less sexy.  I realized I was preparing for a disaster that is was very very unlikely.  My gear, even if they mean filling your bag with everyday items instead of tacticool gizmos.  This is how and what I currently prepare for:

**Most Likely**
House fire/ serious burglary/ injury to me or someone nearby / family or friend emergency
In the scenarios I have listed here I may have to leave my house on very short notice (something common to most disasters) or I don't have access to the resources I normally rely on (the things in my home).  This does not require any camping gear

* List of contacts and important phone numbers like friends, none emergency police, neighbours

* Cash and credit card.  The credit card is for traveling incase you needed to rent a car

* Well stocked medical kit in easily accessible location

* Method of quickly securing my home so I can leave it for long periods of time. -&gt; Safe or good hiding spot in home

* Full tank of gas in vehicle.


**Medium Likelihood**
Local or regional disaster such as utility failure, contact friends, family, and insurance, and stay somewhere other than your home such as a hotel or a shelter (school gym or stadium setup with cots and food).  The biggest challenge is going to be deciding when to leave and the actual traveling.  Therefor the next level of gear on top of what I listed above is:
* Compact

* Food; candy and protein bars for energy which you will burn up quickly when stressed.  Perhaps a few full meals that can be made and eaten easily such as in a car

* Clean change of clothes

* Entertainment for waiting in long lines

* Phone charger for keeping in contact with people who are concerned about you.

* Sleeping bag

* Low profile self defence


**Unlikely**
Large scale support system failure such as major blackout, bank run.  Although I believe that a bank run or other financial crisis might one day get moved to the ""medium likelihood"" category at the moment I don't feel it warrants it.  In this situation you might be leaving the place you live for anything from weeks to forever, competing with others for very limited resources, and not having much information on the situation.  This is really a different level of preparedness and takes real commitment to be fully prepared.  The bugout bag in this level of emergency becomes a get home bag.  The bag should contain everything you need to get to a place you have already prepared for long term survival.  You can probably throw away most of the stuff I listed above.  Instead pack load it out much like a conventional hiking pack:
* Good pair of hiking boots

* High density food

* Water and water purification

* Shelter and sleeping equipment

* Defence

* Medical kit

This last list is similar to bags I see many people putting together
* A place that has food for months

* A community already established to help support you mentally

* Things of value that can be bartered with.

I know its fun to shop and load up with high tech toys, keep the car full of gas, and not use the emergency cash stored in your pack.

**TLDR:** Most bugout bags are better for going camping then dealing with scenarios that are likely to happen.  Think of the disaster that is most likely to happen to you,False,self,t5_2s4l5,False,,,t3_xjvb8

1371495712.0,1gj6w7,"my thoughts after several recent ""my bag was missing something"" posts...",ghostmcspiritwolf,56,8,12,"I think a lot of people are concentrating so heavily on the absolute worst case scenario (societal collapse or something similar) that they totally neglect to think about what the bag is likely to be used for.

here's my quick list of things that might not be in your bag but probably should be:

1. cash
2. a keychain with a copy of every significant key in your life (car(s)
3. a copy of ID and other important documents
4. a small headlamp or other non-tactical light in an outer pocket that is easily accessible
5. extra AA and AAA batteries
6. Advil, and bandaids. first aid kits never come with a large supply of basic medication
7. hand sanitizer
8. very small toiletry kit
9. maybe some reading material
10. toilet paper: bodily functions still exist in the woods. leaves take some getting used to

all in all, and get somewhere safe fairly quickly. even if you need to have weapons, etc. available just in case, they probably aren't the most important part of your kit, and even if society collapses (I'm not a big fan of the ""end of the world"" predictions, but I admit prepping has a fun air of fantasy to it) you likely have a higher chance of dying from disease from not being able to wash your hands than you would from sudden involuntary lead poisoning syndrome.",,self,,

It is a bit overwhelming at first, get off the grid, etc, but then you wind it down to practical things:  a get home bag, or some camping gear.   

Then a bug out bag

But after a while you realize the most rational thing that will happen is a weather related event that forces you to just stay home for a few days while they plow the roads.

I live in New England and this happened just last week:  a driving ban on all roads.  Not marshal law by any means

And last week I was fairly ready:  we had food, ways to stay warm, etc., so I thank reddit for helping me get ready.

However

But tonight I bug'd out.  Literally.  I am typing this from a local hotel room.

Here's my story:

I went home after a day of chores to my CO2 alarms going off.  Not really knowing what to do (something I should have known!)

(I know it is odorless and tasteless

After about 20 minutes my wife came home with dinner and we started to cook

We stopped by the local fire department just to ask the pro's what we should have done and they pretty much looked at us like we were morons

So they walked around the house with a meter

They were fairly confident it was a defective/old alarm so they left and we went right out and bought 2 new detectors and set them up...and waited...

But nothing happened so we ate dinner and did our usual evening stuff...

....as my headache got worse. Then my wife started feeling bad


TL;DR:
Whether it was real or imagined, all the while the fumes (if real) were building up, making us worse.

Each minute we spent there was potentially extremely dangerous but we needed this

We are at a hotel now and already feel better.

So, every day situations that are so trivial and minor (or even possibly just imagined) that you need to be ready for.

TL;DR, replace them.

And get ready to bug out!

The area I would like to discuss specifically is shelter. I know many are minimalists, so it tends to be an INCH bag as well. [This](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0045TDU4K) is my 68L bag. I don't want to skimp out on quality for gear. The ideal aim is to get the most compact/lightweight (backpackers style) gear as possible. Living in Canada, I'd like to make it as 4-season as possible, while still keeping it compact. Not sure how possible this is, and how likely I would really consider camping out at -30 degree Celsius weather (I guess one wouldn't have a choice!). I want to add value to the BOB, but realistically it'd likely be most used to get me to a BOL/retreat and/or when the car breaks down.

The first time I was a foreign student in Beijing during the SARS outbreak. Young and foolish as I was

The second time happened more recently when a gunman seized control of my office building. I was in a meeting and didn't have time to make it back to my desk before we were evacuated. Fortunately, and apartment keys in my pocket so I could get home but I did not have my phone so it was a few hours before I could connect with concerned friends and family. I learned that when SHTF, your bugout bag is probably going to be whatever is on your person or within an arm's reach at that moment. What I wish I had at the time: A phone with 3g (to get updates on the situation via Twitter, etc. from those on the outside and to connect with friends and family immediately afterwards).

In the pouch I also have an old [Nokia 2600 Tracfone](http://www.amazon.com/Nokia-2600-Tracfone-Prepaid-Phone/dp/B0077EX1GW/) and battery (I keep it separate in the bag). On one of the zippers I have a [little LED keychain](http://www.amazon.com/MICRO-BLACK-KEYCHAIN-BRIGHT-FLASHLIGHT/dp/B001I9EICI/).

That's it. Just enough to continue living in society and begin piecing my life together again if for some reason I had to leave my apartment on extremely short notice.

* Sig Sauer will lap-dancing their way into the world of HK with the launch of their first SMG
* Glock has been generating a lot of buzz after a post to ""expect BIG news"" on their Facebook. Since then, a single-stack 9mm/.40, to a range of polymer rifle accessories. Last week, the revealed part 1 of a 3 part reveal, [Glock ID](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151344895316797&amp;set=a.158024376796.112283.106625151796&amp;type=1&amp;theater). 
* Remington will be showcasing their new [783](http://www.remington.com/en/product-families/firearms/centerfire-families/bolt-action-model-783.aspx), in my mind, is a great move.
* Winchester's new caliber,350 from a .17 HMR].
* Ruger will finally introduce the SR45, and possibly a .380 LC9 [not sure I follow the logic on that one…]. 
*Additional Beretta Nano models [good move for them
* Maxpedition is set to reveal a new line of CCW-specific gearbags [excited about this one], for their sake, the new line of knives has a warmer reception than their new Ferox.
* A bunch of new [Buck Knives](http://www.lawofficer.com/article/product-announcements/buck-knives-debut-new-knives-2)

There are three main components:

1. **Get Home Bag** - which is an [IFAK leg platform pouch](http://www.rescue-essentials.com/S_T_O_R_M_Operator_IFAK_p/30-1461.htm)

2. **Smaller
. And finally

3. **The large ""when I have to leave home"" [pack](http://proforceequipment.com/product-details.php?id=163&amp;catid=28)** by snugpak.

*Contents of each are as follows (and subject to change of course).*



**The Get Home Bag:**
* seatbelt cutter with glass punch 

* K-Bar necker-becker knife 

* 16"" collapsible baton

* chemical flare X2 

* 2 large zip-ties

* led flashlight w/ 2 sets extra batts 

* leatherman multi tool (I think its the wave) 

* bandana 

* first aid kit 

* protein bar 

* 25ft paracord 

* small whetstone 

* compass 

* signal mirror 

* binoculars 

* lighter 

* matches 

* thermal/solar blanket 

* trioxane (fire starter) 

* pair of leather work gloves 

* pen and paper 
 



**The Smaller modular backpack (also camping slingpack)**

* bivy sac 

* mess kit 

* granola bars 

* water purification tabs (looking to get steri-pen) 

* wind-up/solar radio 

* small lantern (with extra batts) 

* more intense first aid items (larger bandages

* 32 oz nalgene 

* 16 oz stainless cup by klean kanteen 

* bandana 

* matches 

* trioxane (fire starter) 

* 100' paracord 

* notebook and pen 

* ""how to avoid being killed in a war zone"" 

* sleeping pad 

* fleece jacket 

* Gerber LMF II with sheath 

* small crossbow w/ bolts 

* larger whetstone 

* toothbrush, floss 

* [Maxpedition roly-poly pouch](http://www.maxpedition.com/store/pc/MEGA-ROLLYPOLY-FOLDING-DUMP-POUCH-26p233.htm) to carry -my [sleepingbag](http://proforceequipment.com/product-details.php?id=177&amp;catid=4)




**The Leave-home-bag (the snugpak rocketpack)**

* The center space holds the Hazard4 pack (without the sleeping bag) with room for extra equipment such as

* 50' rope

* large gerber hatchet
 
* sleeping bag would then hang off back

* side compartments would be filled with more clothing


**NOTE** - And don't worry- there is still room for ammo. (I have an AR-7

And the ultimate use-all-of-this scenario would obviously be 
be someplace with car (and thus the get home bag)
and then from there decide either to stay put and bug-in or head out with the sink on my back.

I'm not sure how true it is but I've heard that clotting agents can make infections worse if the wound isn't cleaned.

That said, you may be better off using normal gauze and hope it clots by itself.

1343899457.0,xk0vg,My 3 stage kit list and explanations (long!),user24,14,4,14,"I haven't put all this together yet

It's a work in progress.

The kit is designed to help me through progressively more serious and less likely scenarios, ""up to 48 hours"" and ""more than 48 hours"", which I have labelled ""EDC"", ""Overnight"" and ""Bug out"" respectively.

EDC Bag:

I have put this together and carry it every day. I have empty pockets now and feel liberated. It's simply a cheap leather shoulder bag containing everything I've ever carried in my pockets.

Contents:

* tissue
* mints
* pocket FAK
* fenix LD10
* vic farmer
* keys
* change
* wallet
* carrier bags
* pencil+paper
* phone
* lighter
* playing cards

Overnight bag:

A small pack that will fit inside the BOB in the top section. It will be stored there when not in use so I don't have to scramble around to find 3 bags in an emergency. The contents of this plus the EDC bag should cover a night or two spent at a friend's house or hotel.

Contents:

* toothbrush
* toothpasta
* change of clothes
* hair bands
* hairbrush/mirror set
* deodorant
* mini shampoo
* razors
* mirror
* phone charger
* camera
* camera charger
* loo roll
* soap
* nivea creme
* flannel

BOB:

This is the bag I hope never to use. It's the least well thought out because I've never in 29 years of life had need of one of these

It's designed, and there's no way I would have ventured out with a big bag on my back if that kicked off near me. If the power goes down for a few days that's no reason to head for the woods; I can cook in the garden. We don't get extreme weather. Another problem is that once you strike off the obvious scenarios, the remaining ones are so diverse it's difficult to do a one-size-fits-all kit list. One bag to cover anything from local flooding to national warfare to mass civil unrest?

So TBH I'm dubious as to the value of a BOB and I think a bug-out-vehicle is much more practical than a bag

* USB stick with encrypted scans of personal documents, which is really crackable but any computer can decrypt it which is handy)

* PAYG WiFi dongle
* Shoes

* Local 1:50000 map

The BOB is a large plastic box I keep in my car- I've had a much smaller version since I got the car and it's come in handy several times when dealing with smaller things (mostly forgetting clothes on overnight trips or not having time to pack before leaving). I have a Honda Element, and I haven't listed a tent because I think I should be able to camp in my car.

I'm also trying to plan a BOB for the cat. So far I plan to include her carrier, two bowls, treats, a toy, towels to line the carrier in case of long car rides, a blanket, and her harness/leash.

Suggestions for things I should add to/remove from any of these three kits would be great. Guns aren't an option right now because of lack of money &amp; training (and they shouldn't be necessary for any of these situations anyway)

Here is what we have so far

* Two first-aid kits, where we've been going when the sirens go off.
* A battery-powered LED camping lamp.  We bought this 6 months after we moved here, which is bullshit, since we obviously had signed up for power.  The account was under my phone number, in my husband's name, and they had been accepting our payments for 6 months with no problem.
* A fire-striker my husband's mother gave us for Christmas a couple of years ago.
* A couple of Leatherman knives (just small ones
* A bedroll
* Several emergency blankets

I found a couple of good resources online for what to carry with you in a BOB

My main focus is that I want to keep this bag as cheap as possible.  While we're far from destitute, if at all possible, though if it's not possible, I understand.  Can I use any kind of bag, as long as it's comfortable?  What is the best style to use and why?  I've had my eye on a computer backpack that I can get for around $12.  Currently I have [this](http://www.wengerna.com/synergy-12338) bag, but I use it as a day-bag for travelling, and I'd like to not have to tie it up as a bugout bag.

1355616202.0,14x1ap,"This weekend I'm packing medical supplys, anything missing?",The_Real_XECH,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/bugout/comments/14x1ap/this_weekend_im_packing_medical_supplys_anything/, just us. The first one is inside my B.O.B. it is more of a general medical/hygiene kit and will be inside my main bag with my other gear. Second on the list is my ""medical kit"" it has more serious medical and is an overflow for what I can't carry on my back. It is a sturdy tan burlap strapped bag with zippers

I don't know much about medicine but have a general understanding of the basics. The kit I'm aiming for is more of a novice medical bag to treat injury and illness with essential tools and medicines.

The third would be a small kit with only a few things in it and would be quite small (pocket size) and would be kept in my car most of the time. I have not started making this one yet. Honestly I'm not sure where to start so any links to small kits or a list of useful medical that will fit in a altoids can or small baggie would be helpful.
