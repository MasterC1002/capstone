As a veteran barefoot/minimalist runner (3.5 years) and bf ultramarathoner

Don't be fooled by marketing: VFFs *do* significantly alter your mechanics from barefoot. Anyone who's been barefoot for a significant length of time notices immediately how unnatural the toe positioning is. The rubber constrains your movement

Paradoxically, since the toes don't have to fight the resistance of each individual toe pocket. And the sole is more uniform throughout, so your foot can actually adapt to the ground instead of adapting to the VFF sole pattern. I feel like I'm balancing on top of the VFFs, while closed-toe minimal shoes feel ""flat"" to the ground.

When I've tried on VFFs

VFFs have two things in their favor: One, here's the kicker: BFT doesn't wear them anymore. Now he only runs in sandals or nothing.

My recommendations for footwear are

1. Barefoot (when possible).

2. ""Luna sandal"" or ""Invisible Shoe"" style open-toe sandals.

3. A closed-toe minimal shoe like the Merril Gloves or Vivo Barefoot line.

4. Cross-country or road flats (expensive but low durability).

5. Flat-soled ""non-running"" shoes

6. Marshmallow running shoes.

VFFs aren't on there at all.

It seemed to come with its own set of downsides, I seemed to be running shorter distances overall. Second, pain eventually developed in my arches, forefoot, and achilles tendon.

The pain got to a point in my achilles tendon where I could feel it in the first 10 strides of a run. It was nothing severe - at most an annoyance and an inconvenience - but it did concern me. I hoped Google would give me an answer, was landing too far into the forefoot.

I was running almost toe first. My heel would ever so briefly kiss the ground, and as usual, within the first 10 strides or so, my achilles tendon started throbbing. Remembering what I had read, I shifted my strike back to just behind the ball of my foot. Careful not to let my foot land completely flat and slap the ground, but also careful to let all of my foot take part in my stride. Still landing on my forefoot, but letting my midfoot and heel do a good deal of work as well.

NEVER before has a change in technique brought about such instant change. When I was extreme forefoot striking I almost felt like I was running in place sometimes; moving my strike back instantly widened my stride and kicked my pace way up. My achilles pain instantly vanished

I’m 27, fairly fit, and have never been above 11% bf in my life. I have always disliked shoes (all shoes trap heat and moisture in a way I find uncomfortable), and I ran barefoot quite often throughout my youth. I’ve also always lived in shoes-off households, so I spent much of every day barefoot even before changing my outside footwear. My previous outside footwear included Chuck Taylors and today’s conventional tennis shoes. 

I changed my shoe preferences two years ago because it fit with my general health philosophy (i.e., I was blessed with an uncanny ability to not give a f**k, which helps when starting out barefoot running, etc. 

In the last two years, unshoes, and softstars: i.e., minimalist all-stars. 

**My story**
The exact timeline is fuzzy because it’s been a while. TLDR; **SEE THE TITLE**

Relatively soon after I changed my shoe preferences, switched back to regular shoes until it went away, and eased back into minimalist shoes/barefoot . That took about 2 months, but once I finished the slow transition, the PF didn’t come back, so I was pleased. 

Sometime later, I noticed the underlying bone was very sore. This blossomed into metatarsalgia, and my arches started to fall. It seemed like what I was experiencing matched up with [Morton’s foot-type issues](http://www.triggerpointbook.com/mortons.htm), so I tried implementing a Morton’s pad into my shoes. 

This didn’t really do anything, etc.,” so nothing came of this visit. 

By this point, and I just wanted some relief. I tried [fancy insoles](http://www.mortonsfoot.com/metatarsalgia.html) for a month or so, and those did nothing. My plantar fasciitis came back in my left foot, and I started having top-of-the-foot pain. The latter developed into a visible bump as the tendon over that metatarsal became increasingly inflamed. 

I started practicing a number of foot exercises, who knows), but they didn’t resolve my pain.

This is where I tried [toe-spreaders](https://nwfootankle.com/correct-toes). About 1 year and 6 months into this, but remained, as did the calluses and the small bump. After easing into them, I wore the toe-spreaders religiously 24-7 in wide shoes for about a month and was thankful for the relief.

Then the metatarsalgia pain started coming back in force, but I couldn’t find them online. I bought them because I had already spent so much money on shoes and curatives that I figured it didn’t matter. I put them into my VBF Aquas and started wearing them around. Within three days, my feet were completely pain-free. 

It’s now a month later, and the bump on top of my foot is gone. 

**Leftovers**
I understand an inevitable criticism here is going to be, most of the evidence around barefoot running suggests that the form is the most important factor. Indeed, that’s the entire point behind minimalist shoes. If one has to be completely unshod to reap the benefits we tout ‘round these parts, then we should probably stop advising people that VFFs will help them.  *Even the taurahumara wear shoes.*

My own feelings about this experience are pretty complex. I invested a lot both emotionally and economically into BR. I can’t say for sure that switching to “barefoot” caused my problems. After all, overall health, and the sequence of events, I do think it’s more likely than not that the switch did cause my issues.  

I’m sharing this story because I don’t want anyone else to go through what I did. Scientific and anecdotal evidence suggests barefoot is good.  It works for a lot of people. But, all I care about is that I can walk pain-free and run again. 

For now

So, then walking for 2, and gradually minimizing walking time while maximizing running time a la couch to 5k. Unfortunately, my endurance generally did not increase at all. My heart will palpitate if pushed too hard; it continued to do so, and so I was forced to limit myself.

Two weeks ago I watched [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=787hU5R79JY) and practiced the 'posture reset' portion of it. Although my cadence is still low (160-170) and my foot strike is somewhat heel-oriented, and I did it in VFFs. Previously I couldn't run for more than 1.5-2 minutes without getting dizzy and feeling like my heart was going to jump out of my chest. Yesterday I ran for ten solid minutes.

1337189556.0,tq8ft,My experience after nine months of minimalist running ,xan4tr,37,2,23,"Minimalist running has a had a huge positive impact on my life

* **Background**: I am a 30-something fit male

* **Starting out**: I heard about min running from a co-worker who is very over-weight but had been showing up to work in spandex and Huarache sandals (quite a sight) claiming he had been running regularly and he was really loving it and was up to 4 miles.  I quizzed him a bit, more efficient steps.  In any case, after a couple months it was clear that all my knee, ankle and IT band pains JUST SIMPLY WENT AWAY.  It became obvious that the repetitive heel striking of old, no matter how slight it seemed, when repeated thousands of times over the course of a run, adds up to the problems I had experienced with running all my life.  Since I was still running small distances and rather slow, running was now also fun for some reason.  Maybe it was just a magic feather running around in these funny looking shoes or maybe my body actually liked this new running style.  I wasn't sure.  And

* **Results after 9 months**:  I am happy to report that I can knock out six miles with an ease that I never imagined possible and most importantly it is 100% PAIN FREE.  ok, but that is a good pain!  I know my muscles are building and I look forward to adding another quarter mile or more to my distance every next week.  I honestly see no end in sight.  I feel like now that I've worked thru the first few months of foot muscle and ligament readjustment, it is now all downhill from here.  I fully expect to be running 10-15 miles at a time by the end of this summer.  I'm so addicted to running now I wonder if I will be running marathons at some point and running the Leadville 100 before long (ok pipe dream of course).  I'm slowly adding speed to my technique and I can run about as fast now as I used to in my old heel-stompers.  My calf muscles feel like spring-loaded machines.  When they have rested a few days, I feel like i'm running in low-gravity.  The quicker strides are more efficient.  Everything feels right.  I find I am smiling during and after runs.  Before, I recall just wanting to get the run over with.  There is definitely a significant mental component to running; when you want to be out there it is a totally different experience.  When i see heel-stompers slamming their weight into the ground it is painfully obvious what was going on. 

* **Lessons learned**: Your first few times out, you will feel like when you were a teenager and hit the bench press for the first time and couldn't cross your arms for a week.  Progress is sloooooow.  I estimated I added a quarter mile to my max distance per week or about a mile per month.  I experienced some small, dull pains in my feet which I attributed to my feet adjusting to significant muscle growth and various ligaments stretching out.  These always went away within hours or the next day.  Some minor acute pains cropped up and when they did I laid off right away.  Again, these went away pretty quickly and I think this too has to do with your foot re-adjusting.  At about the 7 month mark, I got too excited and ran 25 miles in one week.  The next week one of my achilles tendons became agitated.  I knew enough to know you NEVER want to injure your achilles significantly b/c it takes a long time to heal and has a memory of injuries so I laid off for 2 weeks with only light running.  The bottom line is to be patient.  You can get injured doing this if you run too much too fast.  However, if you train at a steady pace, you will reap major benefits and discover the joy of running in a way you have never before.  Also, give them 2 or 3 days off.

1306858605.0,hob63,Couch to Half-Marathon (barefoot) in 18 months,computertech,34,3,24,"I thought I would share my story about running. 

March of 2010 I weighed myself and I was about 180 pounds (I am short 5'6""). It was normal for me to sit on my ass all day (I am a computer guy) and eat a lot of junk food. I felt bad all the time

I then decided to start running. My wife had been running her whole life and I told her I wanted to start running with her. First day I went about half a mile and was dying, next day I went a little over a mile and an accomplishment for me was to be able to run for more than 5 minutes without stopping.  I was in a lot of pain, I would come home and ice my knees and shins. We did that for a week or so and I signed up for my first 5K.  

While training for the 5K I went out and got some $200 shoes

I then stopped by a running store on the way home and bought some Vibram five finger classic style. Two days later I ran in them and I couldn't believe: I ran some good 4 miles and I felt great.. or so I thought. Turns out I was doing too much too quickly.. and my calves felt like they were getting stabbed with every step I took. But what does a runner do when they are in pain? they run harder.. so I did, half way during a 4 mile race something popped in my feet. It was the infamous plantar fasciitis. I was able to finish the race completely barefoot but the pain was too much. 

That day I got the book by McDougal ""born to run""  and devoured it, that destroyed my arch and killed my calves.  i thought I was done. 

I then got another book by Michael Sandler called ""Barefoot Running"" and I actually went to a book presentation by Michael. In the book I learned that I had been doing too much too quickly and that If I were to run barefoot I had to start properly and take my time. 

So we did that, second: run 200 yards on grass / rest two days"" I had zero faith on the program. However, since my plantar fasciitis was still bad I gave it a shot anyway. I did that program plus stepping and massage-rolling the bottom on my foot on a baseball a couple hours a day.

After a couple of months I was up and running 5Ks again

I have signed up for a half marathon in September and a couple of 10Ks before then. Also

I have been practicing running a 5K every other day and then once a week I run as far as I can. Last night I ran 10 miles (my record) and besides a busted nail and sore muscles I feel great.

So

1. Start slowly
2. Don't run if you hurt
3. Watch videos and ask people
4. Focus on your posture while running: straight back, use your toes and your foot muscles to bounce your body up. 
5. You should feel smooth, almost like flying low.

tl;dr: I went from being a lazy ass to running 10 miles (and loving it)  in 14 months.

I've been wearing VFFs since 2007 and, unfortunately.

The newer models have anti-microbial stuff

Here are a few tips and tricks I've used:


* Baby powder

Put some baby powder in the shoe and/or on your foot prior to wearing them. It can keep your feet a bit more dry


* Tea tree (or some other) essential oil

Apply a few drops of an essential oil (peppermint, the entire load will smell like the essential oil. This will not prevent odor, but it can mask it really well.

* Baking soda

If you are letting the shoe sit overnight


* Pre-clean with a toothbrush

Before cleaning in your washer, you can just do this at the end of every day with a dry brush and some baking soda, then put a few drops of essential oil in them.


* Try to wash once a week

Yea


* Wash your feet when you can

Just finished your workout at the gym? Go wash your feet real quick! Just showed up to a friends house and need to take your shoes off? Leave the shoes outside to air and excuse yourself to use their bathroom to wash 'em up real quick. You don't have to announce ""HOLY SHIT gotta wash my feet!"" Just go take care of it if you get the chance.


* Consider two pairs

The most expensive option. One pair for non-exercise use

If anyone has any other tips

This past Friday, so she got a book out and ""diagnosed"" me with stinky feet.  Her solution was a tea soak (like the one I linked to - just to show I wasn't crazy, because I thought she was when she suggested it).

Here's what we've done:

- Prepare 2 regular black tea bags (Lipton is what we've used so far) in a mug.  Pour boiling water over them and steep for 15 minutes.  

- In a pan large enough to fit both of your feet prepare enough warm water to fully cover your feet. 

- After tea bags have steeped add the ""foot tea"" to the water.

- Soak your feet for 30 minutes (I'm doing this as I type).

- After 30 minutes towel dry your feet.

- After feet have aired out prepare the following solution:
1 tablespoon on lemon juice
2 drops of lemon oil extract

- Put the above solution on a cotton swab and swab feet.

- Let your feet air dry again.

- Try to stay barefoot as much as possible.

I've had 3 days of no stinky feet for the first time in my adult life.  I even wore hiking boots with wool socks

As to the shoes

So far this has been successful for me.  When I told coworkers today about the remedy and its success so far they acted like their lives would be changed forever!

*This was my first long run in the new huaraches from www.invisibleshoe.com. I think they did very well. I had no concerns about them staying on

*At the end of the run, and it didn't want to leave. I didn't want to break stride/rhythm to get it out so I left it there. But it wasn't that big a deal anyway. The last mile of this run was difficult. My ankles, legs and pelvis areas hurt. I think I am using a somewhat different set of muscles in these shoes than what I used with the Vibrams. 12 hours later I still feel sore, but it's a good sore. No injuries or anything like that. I did get a small blister on the left side of my left foot, same place as in the previous 2 shorter runs in the huaraches (from the left side ankle knot).

* Really run barefoot to start!: Only rarely use minimalist shoes, which is wicked easy to do. The feel will help you know when you are pushing or doing something wrong. I never 'got it' until after I started jogging more purely barefoot (after a shod run is a good time, just take off the shoes and hold them). After you 'get it', still run really barefoot every once in a while to keep your form tuned.

* Don't push with your feet!: Lean forward to speed up, push you up a to recover from the drop, then lift off cleanly as you move ahead. Your run should really just be a sustained fall forwards...

* Placement: although obviously don't land on your heel

* Cadence: unless you are going up a hill or jogging very slowly

* Be a wheel: keep your knees bent and hips low and upper body relatively vertically stable. Actually speed up and down with slight dips in the terrain. 

Any others or better descriptions of the above?

When I was in high school I joined the track team in an effort to be interested in sports. Within a month of practice I ended up at the podiatrist having my feet looked at and my gait analyzed. He told me that I was flat footed and need to buy these incredibly ugly

About the same time I quit track, I found that I didn't have any pain in any part of my legs when I wore them and up until 6 months ago I continued to wear them every day. 

I heard about ""toe shoes"" through my cousin and our good friend. They had the Fila Skeletoes and I though they looked interesting. When I had the chance I googled ""toes shoes"" and VFF's popped up. I hadn't even known Vibrams existed until then. After discovering this whole barefoot movement and the science behind being barefoot

At first I walked a little awkward in them since I wasn't used to having my toes separated like that and I was still hell striking in them. I almost gave up on them for a bit because I just couldn't get the hang of walking in them. Then one day I decided to stop concentrating so hard on the proper form and from then on I had no issues with it.

I have to admit I fell in love with my VFFs. As someone who is prone to massive blisters when I walk long distances

Not only were my blisters gone

Now that it's winter, the Chucks work fine, but I definitely won't be using them for every day shoes.

Now I'm not meaning to sound like an advertisement, my feet swell a bit and the openings of the shoes get a bit tight; I'm constantly readjusting the strap on my sprints because of this. I don't like the way they are sized either: my big toe fits, but I have at least a quarter of an inch of extra shoe on my three middle toes and just barely any room on my pinkie toe.

That being said, I'm seriously considering taking up running again as I've put on a few pounds and I feel comfortable enough now with my legs and feet to do something more strenuous than walking.

What are some of your stories with going barefoot/barefoot footwear? I'd love to hear your experiences.

I recently made the switch to mid-foot running and using minimalist shoes about 1 year ago. For the trail I use Inov-8 Roclite 295. For the road I began with New Balance MR10

I followed a fairly strict schedule of my transition to minimalism:

* began first week with 3 days of light jog/walk intervals of no more than 1.5KM each day.
* the next 2 weeks I reduced the walking segment of the interval by about 20% each week.
* by the 4th week
* starting with week 6 I began increasing mileage by around 10% each week.
* once I got up to around 8K each run
* I always stretch for about 20-30 minutes after each run.
* most days of the week I was doing foot exercises to help stretch the feet, courtesy of various minimalist website recommendations.
* I also had 2 days a week where i did some basic core exercises

During the first few weeks I had no pains in legs, and a slight soreness in calves appeared. I read this was normal and that it would go away. Well, fast forward a year and it still has not gone away.

Over the past year of training

During the 2 breaks, jump around, etc all without feeling any stiffness or soreness in my calves. But outside those breaks, my calves have always been sore. It's not painful, but its uncomfortable. 

When I begin my run
About 4 hours after each run

So I am reaching out to all you experienced runners for some guidance before I give up entirely. Is it normal for calves to always be sore? Am I doing something wrong? What can I do to get back to feeling good?

So, learn to love it!! For anyone curious, these are some things I found out about running in the rain:

1. Concrete tends to be slippery. It forms a layer of dust, but when it rains all that lifts up and makes it very slippery. Slow down and walk if needed. Asphalt tends to provide great traction though.
2. Do not wear cotton! I invested in actual running shorts and shirts
3. Your bear feet will dry up within seconds of touching a dry surface. What shoe do you know that can dry up instantly after being soaked!?
4. Your eyebrows move the rain out of your face so it doesn't fall in your eyes. Your eyelids help dry up any water that does fall in your eyes
5. Do not be afraid of mud! Walk over it and get that 'dirty' look. You can wash them on the puddles and your feet will be like new.
6. You can now walk over water!! Walk over those puddles. It felt amazing stopping and walking over puddles
7. Feel like alpha when you see everybody turn around because water or mud covers the road and there's no way around it

Hit my first milestone! Broke 10 minute mile barrier in my vibram KSO.

Ten years ago I started lifting and put on about 60 lbs of muscle and never ran so the tendons in my feet and calves never caught up to the extra mass. I've had the KSOs for a few years simply for dead lift and squats but never ran. Been floating between 10-13% body fat since then. Then I started climbing (indoor boulderimg) and decided I need to be around 7-8% body fat.....

So I started reading about minimalist running in my VFF.  I started with .33 miles. The next time I went 0.5 and my calves were thrashed. I felt like I had been paralyzed and had to relearn to stride when I ran because I was a former heel striker when I was younger. Then the next time I went I went 0.75 miles then finally I ran a mile in 10:24. Since then I've just been shaving my time down. Next time was 10:00 then today was 9:2!

I'm hoping to work it down to 8 minutes and maybe a 25 minute 5k in the next few months and complete a v6 in climbing.

I had some knee problems last year, really enjoyed myself.

But I don't want these knee problems coming back to haunt me in the future.  I've started running again this month, and the more I read, the more I see so many success stories of barefoot running.  And as I am a guy who is up in the hills at least once a week, I think trail running would be an amazing experience as well.

So I'm going for it today.  I'm comfortable barefoot, and I thank you!  I will post later today with the results!

Edit: Results!  Absolutely amazing!

I went down to a local park with a half mile loop around the lake.  I did 1.5 total, but resisted all but once (not surprisingly, down a small hill!)  It just feels so natural!  Landing on the ball/front side of the foot and kicking out, using that natural springboard!  You were all correct-I wanted to go on, but I resisted!

My one mistake was taking about 1/4 of the course on hot asphalt.  Have a few blisters on my feet from the roughness and heat

My biggest observation was the different parts that this style of running worked.  As mentioned, I'm a little stuff.  This time?  Nothing.  No stiffness, no pain.  My knees felt amazing!  I could feel some calf muscles being worked that hadn't before, but joints all the way down were great.

Thank you so much for your inspiration guys!  I'm hooked-I'm an outdoorsman

I do have a couple final questions.

1. I'm used to running in general

2. Would a 10-mile run by the end of the summer be out of the question?

3. What do you guys usually do during the winter?  I despise treadmills, so winters are cold).  Maybe some kind of insulated minimalist shoe?

1371015217.0,1g6g6o,Former long distance runner. Just read an article on barefoot running. I stopped running because of injuries and I would love some advice.,CrashAtlas,17,1,32,"Dear Barefooters

I was a serious long distance runner until several years ago. I started in my teen years and kept it up until well past my twenties. But I began to have pain in my knees. A kind of burning pain under my kneecap...kind of.... I cut back on the distance and swapped it up with occasional swimming and biking. 

Then I had an accident. Strangest thing. I was going up stairs, as if someone had tackled me and forced my MCL  and knee to bend inwards. I didn't have health insurance (the doc only saw me because my parents had spent so much money with him, he did it as a favor, so I got a diagnosis, but no treatment other than a leg brace...still it was free, so no complaints). 

I rehabed on my own

It's been several years. I stopped swimming because even that hurt. But I miss running terribly. I've gained weight. So I read about barefoot running and bought myself VFF. I ran barely half a mile today and felt like a cripple

I am looking for wisdom

Thoughts? 

EDIT: I want to thank everyone for their thoughts and encouragement. I have to admit that I have been so discouraged at times that I would never run again. Hearing stories about how you all have overcome injuries makes me feel like this is the right way. 

I think I will start doing some long walks barefoot (or in VFF's as I am not completely comfortable totally barefoot yet) and do some slow ""runs"" a couple of times a week to build up as you all have suggested. 

Just the idea that this might work is a huge encouragement. I realize I might not ever be as fast as I was

I just miss going out my front door and running. Going up the mountains and running. 

Thanks you guys. I have subscribed so I hope to be a part of this community.

1.  Blisters.  Blisters everywhere.  Small ones I grant you but at the end of those 10km runs I wasn't going to be able to wear the sandals again until my feet had repaired.  Fortunately the location of the blisters didn't affect me wearing my regular running shoes.

2.  ATS.  Pretty good

3.  Monkey Grip.  I'm having a mixed experience

4.  Vibram sole.  The sandal was surprisingly firm which I didn't expect, I think it's firmness is partly why it sticks to the foot so well.  I did think the 12mm sole was going to be a bit spongy but it's definitely not.  One thing I'd wish they'd do is angle the front of the sole slightly, the sole is literally stamped out of some rubber which leaves that cliff at the front which is just begging to clip things - I nearly stacked it on my first run.  I have odd sized feet as well so I'm going to take them in to a bootmaker and get him to clip one of the sandals to better fit my foot.

5.  Heat.  Most of my runs have been pretty warm and I was hoping the Sandal was going to keep my feet super cool.  Unfortunately

6.  Trail running.  I've run a little bit on the trails and the thickness of the sole made for a comfortable run however some of the trails I run are a bit technical and not particularly well maintained.  I think the few occasions where a stick or branch has lodged itself between sandal and foot has put me off seriously considering these for my trail running.",,t5_2rp0r,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/BarefootRunning/comments/1907zl/luna_mono_sandals_first_impressions/

But after reading Born to run

I then went for a real barefoot run when the weather cleared up a few weeks ago.  It was okay

Last week I went ahead and got some Merell Trails Gloves.  I went on a few runs

But then I watched some more running technique and form videos and off I went for the last 3 days.

Now the thing that is the most counter intuitive about good technique is the steps/min.  When running starts to feel hard you can't slow down your steps per minute

Your muscles are designed to bounce at that rhythm.  Suddenly my running went from feeling like a slog to feeling like I was bouncing along.

The next important technique is to listen to your body, you have to find the technique that will get you around it.

&gt;Since gravity is your main source of forward propulsion, not for propulsion. 



I've seen practitioners explain this with falling trees, that's what a Chi Runner wrote on Jason's site) and best of all the fact that all the elite Kenians have ""tiny legs, because they use gravity when running"". I must have watched different marathon broadcasts because none of those guys are leaning from their ankles.
Some Chi Runners will even even inform you that, effortlessly orbiting the earth slightly above ground, gravity providing all the forward momentum they could ever want.


Concentrating on lifting the leg (""stepping over a log"") instead of forcefully pushing off with the foot doesn't magically stop the leg from moving you forward. Isn't the storage and subsequent release of energy the whole idea behind midfoot landings and a high cadence? Where does that energy go but up the achilles and calves and back into the ground

The lower legs do a lot of work in all of this. Danny Dreyer, that way it's pretty easy to say that the lower legs are _only needed for momentary support_. If you do the exact same thing barefoot your achilles and calves will have to work quite hard and, most importantly, in a way they are not at all used to if you are just starting, to take the forces that previously went into your artificial cushioning. This will happen regardless of how much you lean forward.

There is no magic way of leaning forward and floating over the earth with hardly any involvement of your legs

Start slow





edit:
&gt;best of all the fact that all the elite Kenians have ""tiny legs

This is a bit unclear on my part, most likely without even being aware of it - which is funny in itself because that would hardly make it a ""revolutionary approach"".

Plus I can't even fathom the forward angle that would be necessary to get to those speeds by simply leaning forward and engaging your core. Remember

I've found that by getting a ball, is a great cheap training tool for running form. Please note that this is not considered ideal dribbling form for competitive soccer and is simply a training tool. Best place to look is your local thrifts store; I got mine for $1.50

First, if you get into the habit of staring at the ball it makes it even harder to start running with it.

As you walk

The key is to time when your knee lifts such that your foot naturally drops with toes pointing down and strikes the ball all on its own; there is no need to think about kicking the ball. Ideally this ought to occur when the ball is sitting where your other foot would be placed if you were standing up straight with your knees slightly bent.

If it helps

Think about walking *with* the ball rather than attempting to control its path. 

Once you can walk without looking at the ball and keeping it going on a straight course, and you don't even have to think about it. Then ditch the ball and go trail running.
The upside of using a ball over running without one is that serves as a good training tool for uneven terrain if none is available. You can up the difficulty by bringing the ball with you while trail running. 

You'll quickly find that it is much, you might notice that your balance improves due to having to correct for crappy touches when the ball goes off course--this forces you to use your hips to change direction

EDIT: another important aspect I forgot

EDIT 2: this is also a great way to drill ""off balance"" running and could provide an interesting alternate 'run' to help avoid overuse injuries from running on perfectly flat pavement all the time (more an issue in the burbs)",,t5_2rp0r,1356324671.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/BarefootRunning/comments/15at79/barefoot_running_drills_using_a_ball/

Hi all!

I Ran Cross Country and Track way back in high school (15 years ago)!
Recently got back into running after 10 years of no regular exercise. I was thin (6 foot

After about 2 months of about 15 miles per week (about 3 mile runs each run) back pain started. Got bad and Knocked me out for about 6 weeks.

Then I decided I probably went too hard too soon. Sedentary lifestyle to running in too short a time.

So I slowed down the running. Been hitting the gym (alternating upper and lower body) for about 6 months. My thinking is that my overall body / core was very weak and needed to be strengthened.

I also started working on my running form. Taking much smaller steps

Now i have Increased running

Recently started having left knee pain. I am determined to be able to run for a very long time

I am transitioning from Brooks Cascadia (relatively light, neutral) to New Balance minimus trail 10.

First thing I noticed: wow

On my first two runs with the new shoes (one on treadmill

It felt a bit awkward. Almost felt like I couldnt keep it up. Just kind of steange. Felt like I lost a few inches in height.

But it felt like a breakthrough. Am I on the right track? I can't seem to reconcile ""upright posture"" with bent knee / almost squatting feeling.
Any thoughts? Am I doing it right?

Thanks!!!

TL;DR: left knee pain. Trying to change form. Bending knee almost feels like squatting. Am I doing it right?

PS I have been lurking here for a while. Heard the Podcast about the barefoot runner (guy that did 80 marathons without shoes of any kind) and learned a lot. Thanks!!",,t5_2rp0r,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/BarefootRunning/comments/18qfds/changing_my_running_form_i_think_i_had_a/

Barefoot running: my attempt at fixing my stride

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPLVmS12RW4

I've been running barefoot off and on for the past two years

I went to a athletic apparel shop in my local mall with a group of friends, or my feet pointed sideways. But I honestly have little pain.

Since I still consider myself new to barefoot running

I'm scared though that my running form is gonna fuck me up in the long run, I'm aware of some of the criticisms of that book too. I also have a friend who's a physical education major who can help me out a bit. He's on the other side of the country, but maybe he can critique my videos along side you guys.

Anyway here's my theory: I run on roads, so my feet follow that.

Plus, I'm doing this when I run. I'm assuming that's bad. How bad is it? And, no, I do not have any pain in my ankles.

In my ""normal"" stride

So today I went back out for the first time, and it went great! No pain, and it felt much more natural. So the moral of the story is, don't let all these internets influence you too much. Listen to your body!

I did my research on what my form should look like and practiced it around the house. I just so happens to already have a pair of VFF that I use camping for water shoes and whatnot so I was excited to actually use them for running. 

As I said I'm not much of a runner and when I do go running I like to stick to a 2 mile route by my house and after that I am usually exhausted. But this time I wasn't at my house. I was at my uncles house in the Texas hill country so I decided that I was just going to run on the highway till I got tired

I started my run. I was focused on my form so I didn't really pay much attention to the discomfort of running that I usually feel.(running mostly on asphalt) I made up the hills pretty easily and going down them was pretty fun  but around 10 min in to the run and my calves started to burn like they never have before.   So I stopped, but without the contracting feeling that a muscle cramp has. I finally make it home. I ran 3 miles and it took me 24 min(I'm not running for speed don't judge)    That was 2 days ago and walking is still pretty painful. I'm walking with a limp in both my legs and it looks pretty funny.  I know I went much too hard for my first run and I feel that I didn't injure myself so I'm not mad at myself. I'm just wondering if my next run should be shorter or of the same length?   I ran better than I ever have with shoes.  I think I know why people do this!   It feels free and natural , and I believe that it is letting me run to my full potential.  I know this was a long post but to those who read some of it I would like to thank you. I hope that I can continue running like this and I hope that I start to love running like y'all do.

I'm new to the minimalist/br scene and wanted to ask if anybody here on reddit has a hammertoe and is able to run without top of the foot pain? (for those unfamiliar.... http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/hammer-claw-and-mallet-toes-topic-overview )  

As for a little bit more information, very slowly as everybody always suggests (I'm a longtime lurker). Because of that I'd like to think it's not a TMTS injury. About two weeks into the running, I started to get some pain around the area of the flexor digitorum longus tendons close to my 2nd digit, which is where I have the hammertoe. I've taken the past week off and the pain did lessen with each day.  I've never had any problems in the past with any shoes ever and I've always played sports and ran.  Around 5-6 years ago I went to a podiatrist and he told me that the hammertoe looked like it was the result of having broken the toe at some point without me noticing (oops) and then it healed improperly.  I didn't opt for any surgery then because it wasn't too big a deal at the time. I'm currently a fit, 20yo Male with absolutely no problems with my left foot and no calf soreness anymore in either of my legs.

My hypothesis is that because I've had this hammertoe for so many years now, I work in a physical therapy office and the therapists there thought that that could be the likely cause.

I have been minimalist running for a couple of years. I ran in Nike Free 3.0 for ages

However...

Many, stretching, strengthening etc etc. But every time I tried running again it would cause issues. I stopped running for months. I still walked barefoot etc.

Finally I gave in and went to a podiatrist - found one who is a runner and is minimalist-friendly. Interestingly he told me I should have (after the initial rest) kept regularly running

This is where you guys come in...

I've tried a bunch of the recommended shoes and I don't really like any of them. Firstly most have that huge heel wedge. I can deal with that, and probably most importantly, they all feel very restrictive in the toe box. I feel like to get one with enough toe/forefoot room I end up with a shoe that's too big. I've tried New Balance in the 2E and it's 'ok'. The store is getting in a 4E for me to try, but I'm not sure that's going to feel great either.

1355721671.0,14za00,My story as a by-myself pose/forefoot runner.,upgoat4peece,16,2,5,"Hello everyone.  I just looked for this reddit because I thought there HAS to be one.  Here it is and here you all are... showing me how I'm not as hardcore as I thought (freakin barefoot runners).

Anyway.  Six months ago I started running as part of an overall fitness plan (the morning my -now ex- wife informed me that she would be leaving 'fatso' aka me.)  

I was pretty fat at the time

Honestly

Brutal. That is the word I would use to describe the process of getting everything right.  I ran a lot.  I ran out of anger.  I ran out of frustration.  I ran to show her what she was missing.  I ran to show myself what kind of person I am.

Eventually

I started with a mid-foot shoe (a pair of kinvaras... still a really nice shoe over all).  As I moved to a true minimalist shoe, I was wearing a very snug pair of fila skel-e-toes.

The process of developing the physiology as a pose runner was arduous and alternately frustrating and rewarding.  I discovered I had major balance issues in my lower leg strength

My running episodes started quite brief, I would typically do plyos or other speed set type bodyweight exercises.  A lot of ladders, jump squats, lunges etc... (I have been trained VERY aggressively before and had some experience to help me forward).  I would wrap up my short runs regularly with 20/10 high intensity interval sets.

Over the next couple months I went from 1/4 mile to very nearly 7 miles on my longer runs.  I had a lot of set backs

I quickly jumped up to 4-5 mile runs and was defeated consistently by calf fatigue 3-4 miles into my runs.  I had some understanding that because my feet couldn't properly compress in my shoes, which was a severe and awesome pain in the ass.

Anyway... I love minimalist running.  Discovering the forefoot compression thing made my day.  Oh and here is a [picture](http://i.imgur.com/KAT7b.jpg) of how I modified my shoes.  I basically just carved away enough padding in the arch so that my foot could bend.  Made a phenomenal difference.  

Overall down to 180 lbs

TL:DR I ran a lot and some stuff sucked

1355671733.0,14xz00,minimalist shoes all day long?,Polloco,16,2,12,"I'm going to apologize for the length of this

So for the past 3/4 of a year or so, until I decided to get some dedicated shoes. I bought some Sanuk board shoes (not minimalist, but zero drop), a pair of Lemings (http://www.lemingfootwear.com/), and a pair of Soft Star RunAmocs for ""dressy"" occasions. I also wore 5 fingers for a bit but they ended up not working out for me to well. 

I've noticed that when I walk totally barefoot, I automatically switch back to heel striking when I walk. It confuses me a bit since I still run with the proper landing. 

I also have noticed that standing barefoot for long periods of time doesn't hurt my feet, but again, when in shoes, I go back to my heel more. 

Lastly, my right foot is sore when I just lay down or wake up from bed, but once I get moving through the day it kinda goes away. When I go running, it doesn't really bother me at all, and massaging it and touching it in places doesn't feel awkward or uncomfortable in the least bit. The arch of the left foot also tends to tighten up more, and I'm wondering if it's a result of the ankle sprain and the surrounding muscles. 

So basically, and what your experience is with it. I'm also interested in someone explaining why minimalist shoes and barefoot are so drastically different in standing and walking.

 I got into the shower with lukewarm water...it took a long time for my feet to warm up. As far as the skin goes

The lady at the shoe store and my friend both told me not to get minimalist running shoes as a beginner. I can't find anything online actually saying that's harmful besides the soreness I'd get (which i'd probably experience no matter what shoe i wore). Currently, they felt awkward and I didn't like how far away from the ground they felt. I actually think it would be BETTER to start with minimal shoes so I can practice good form early on. There's also the benefit of being able to lift weights with minimal shoes, but I don't mind lifting in vans either.

TL;DR

Need some running shoes

* Read about minimalist running and the benefits seemed to be just what I was looking for. 
* (background
* I purchased a pair of NB 730s. They were great. Especially since they're light and don't have the plastic heel support in the back to rub against my heel.
* I restarted the C25K program because all the ""transition guides"" say to start slow. I figured it would be a great way to start with new minimalist-ish shoes. 
* Almost immediately my calves and Achilles were really tight. After further research I understood this to mean 1) I wasn't stretching enough and 2) I was using new muscles and of course they're going to be tight. 
* I do eccentric calf stretches every day
* I'm still working on my form
* Now
* The odd thing is: they only ""hurt"" (again

Now my question is: Is this normal? It seems to be better some days, but I do have plenty of water bottles and NERF &amp; tennis balls to do the job.) How long will it be uncomfortable?

I've been running for ~2 years. I started with 1x/week (2-3 mi) for a year

I bought some VFFs last month. I'd been running in some ""marshmallow"" Mizunos that, I thought a few (short!) runs in the VFFs would be good cross training. 

So this is where I got myself in a bind. I love the VFFs! My old shoes are painful and awkward in comparison (I've always had a forefoot strike), etc). I can't seem to figure out if my old shoes are finally shot, or if the few runs I've done with the VFFs (.25mi, .5mi, then 1.5mi - all pain free) are to blame. I'd really rather not spend $100 to buy new Mizunos only to put them on the shelf after this half, so I'm left with terrible options all around.

One thing I notice is regular pain in the heels of my feet

So I have stumbled in to this subreddit today while fishing around in r/fitness so I wondered if this would be a good time to just switch over as I don't run regularly and my form is probably bad enough that it needs an overhaul anyhow. (I've read a bunch tonight and viewed videos and realize a lot of the problems in both my stride

I've wanted to tackle the Couch-to-5k plan for a while now but I wonder if doing that barefoot is going to be too strenuous on the feet or if they won't adapt soon enough.  Thoughts?

The logical part of me as well as other redditors were saying it was a stupid idea, hiking, climbing, and completing obstacle courses over 12 miles with anything on other than Vibrams.  Shoes are too clunky for me and feel like I have a better chance of twisting my ankles that way than in Vibrams when I was running on and over big rocks.  I felt like a deer sprinting through the forest moving with ease and loved the feeling the rocks, snow, water, and mud beneath my feet.  Although there were a few others that I saw running in Vibrams

A couple of people in my group of 12 got some cramps in their calves along the way and so did many others doing the course.  A few of them also had a lot of knee pain within the last few miles.  I had no cramps or pain the entire way and even felt like I could do some more miles after finishing.  Today I am a little sore but probably not more than anyone else who has completed this challenge.

I understand I am an outlier

I had my VFFs for a month or two before they got wet one day and started stinking.  Now, unacceptable, corn-chip-esque odor coming from them. I've soaked them overnight and let them sun dry countless times, to only have them stink again after one day of wear.  I haven't started running in them yet, as I wanted to get my feet used to the mechanics of walking and running with minimalist shoes before getting back out on the road.

Not sure how the deviation developed or when, my foot still functions like a foot but it throws the leg into misalignment when I run, barefoot or otherwise.

[Here's a picture](http://www.imgur.com/P20yY), but basically the inward ball of my midfoot (where the big toe emerges) protrudes down very slightly and bears more weight. If I let the whole midfoot rest on the ground my ankle rolls outward and I can't apply force straight into the ground.
