A wedding conspires against this, human behavior is such that people in large groups turn into passive watchers and expect to be entertained. This is not a problem. The problem is that the couple, consciously but more often unconsciously, feels that and turns into performers. They're not concentrating on each other.

1370547637.0,1ft8ji,10 things I wish someone had told me BEFORE my wedding day,faile556,194,13,83,"
1. You might not be able to get the ring on your spouse's finger. Stress, and etc all culminate into swollen fingers. That ring that fit just fine last week totally won't fit without some serious shoving during the ceremony.

2. You really won't care about the little stuff, so it no longer matters. I was surprised at how little I cared about things when they didn't work out on my wedding day.

3. You will still care about the big stuff. And something will go wrong to ruin at least one big thing

4. Everyone will lie to you 

5. You might not be able to SLEEP on your wedding night. Putting aside the post-nuptial nookie that's hotly debated on the wedding night. My new husband and I couldn't calm down, no amount of relaxing, hot showers, Benadryl or whatever would get us to pass out. We had to be up super early too for our flight so meandering onto a cruise ship with 2 hours of sleep totally sucked. 

6. Depending on how much time Wedding Planning took up prior to the wedding, it's totally over. You now have loads of free time. 

7. Things you think would be a no brainer

8. You will be surprised at who gives you gifts and who doesn't. This is a touchy one since everyone says, including the most arbitrary ones (labor day, really?!), didn't even get us a Congratulations card. It stuck out because it was very unlike them. Apparently some people really like weddings and some people really don't. 

9. The buck doesn't stop there. You think since the wedding is over the money is done leaving your account? HA! Wedding dress cleaning can range from $80 - $300 depending on what you need done and how you want it ""preserved."" Not to mention postage for the Thank You cards and getting pictures printed that your family and friends took, even if it was ""all inclusive.""

10. Finally, or something because of the stress, hugging all those people, travelling, and even sex (UTI, yeast infection or just general irritation). Even if  you did the deed before your wedding day your immune system could be compromised from all of the above and affect sex too.

I see it in forums and blogs. I don't often (if at all) see it in this subreddit

""I don't get why people spend so much money on 'One Single Day'. It's just a party

""I only spent $3.50 on my wedding and we've been married for 1

""My ring is made out of recycled cat turds that we harvested ourselves on our commune! Anyone who buys a diamond deserves to be forcibly sterilized!"" 

or even

""I'm not getting married because getting a piece of paper to validate your love is stupid and I hope your cake is poisoned because weddings and marriage are just to show off.""

What is this

I get not going into debt for your wedding. It is something I wouldn't do,000 wedding. Sometimes you can put $10,000 down, but would like an extra $5,000 to make it prefect for you. Sometimes you need to have that wedding ASAP because one of you is being deployed, or mom is sick and may not make it another year or two, or you're about to relocate and want to throw the party before you move, who am I to care? 

Nope, eloping or choosing not to, letting their parents help out of necessity or not letting them help out of pride. 

As long as you and your partner are happy

My wedding is not JUST one party, and going all out for me means that I have to spend what many people will consider a frivolous amount of money. Going ""all out"" for some people may mean $1,000. For others, it may mean $500,000. Why do we have to shame others either way? Why do we feel self-righteous about our budgets?

Back in January the death of my Grandfather was very difficult on me and I was having trouble coping with it
When it came to the wedding planning I was very helpful to my bride, it had nearly 2 football fields of wire, 50 pearls, and 200 pages to it, it took me about 100 hours to make) a lot of the craft stuff I did, because I have a job that allows me to work on various things in my downtime. So I stayed very involved in helping with the wedding, while buying a house for us.
Day before the wedding her bridesmaids friends are starting to call the shots, through this I never had a chance to look at all the things I made for the wedding, it became lorded over by the bridesmaids. 
I know it is traditional for the groom to not see the bride before the wedding, when she was admiring the way she looked, I know that that moment was such a sweet moment that I would have loved to have seen it, rather than being kicked outside to sweat out my soul in the hot August sun. I would have loved to take her hand and walk around to look at all the things we made, to just enjoy a moment of peace, it would have done much for my blood pressure and would have made the day so much better for me.

Step 2: Try not to panic. 

Step 3: Decide to elope! Yay! Congratulations! Better start planning!

Step 4: Make plans to go to the courthouse the next morning before work. Inform parents.

Step 5: Use lunch hour to call courthouse repeatedly to schedule a ceremony time

Step 6: After work
approximately 2 am. Fall exhausted into bed after placing order.

Step 7: Go to the courthouse in person the next day. Get marriage license by waiving waiting period. Discover that you can’t get married there today (Thursday). 

Step 8: Research elopement chapels and officiants. Make 200 phone calls. Leave numerous voicemails. Write a dozen emails. Wait for replies.

Step 9: Finally reach coordinator at small chapel. Book it for Saturday. Cringe at cost of last minute elopement package. Text details to immediate family.

Step 10: Purchase last minute airfare to fly groom’s sister in from Arizona. Cringe at cost of last minute flights. 

Step 11: Call local restaurants and ask for last-minute use of banquet room. Book dinner for 18 people following your wedding. Cringe at cost of dinner. Double cringe just thinking about costs of alcohol by the glass.

Step 12: Go to craft store. Buy veil

Step 13: Go to work! Try not to cry at work.

Step 14: Go home. Experience entire range of emotions associated with wedding planning. Sentiments may include
“My FMIL is trying to control everything!”
“This isn’t how I wanted my wedding day to be!”
“I can’t believe this! I get to marry my fiancé in 2 days!”
“Flowers? I need to have flowers? Oh God

Step 15: Try not to cry due to overwhelming stress and emotional onslaught.

Step 16: Fail horribly. Sob shamelessly on kitchen floor. 

Step 17: Dig through closet for dress to wear. Find nothing. Call mother to borrow dress. Find options

Step 18: Go to bed. Toss and turn all night. Fall asleep 10 minutes before alarm goes off. 

Step 19: Go to work again. Try not to cry at work while writing out vows.  Distract yourself with /r/funny. 

Step 20: Leave work and pick up groom’s sister from airport. Play it cool

Step 21: Go to bed. Toss and Turn all night. Wake up at 2am, 7am, and with alarm at 8am. 

Step 22: Go to work on your wedding day because you couldn’t get the time off with such short notice. 

Step 23: Rush home from work and frantically do hair

Step 24: Meet up with immediate family and drive to tiny little chapel hidden in not-so-awesome neighborhood.

Step 25: Wedding! Make sure to hurry through your ceremony in 30 minutes or less so that you don’t have to pay extra

(rhetorical question)

My stigma comes from a lifetime of feeling like a sub-par woman

The truth of the matter is, still, of my body? I know this isn't the form I want to always be, I know I have let myself go and have completely changed my eating and exercise habits, and I'm getting back to where I am comfortable, but I have to start thinking about my dress.

Today I reluctantly made an appointment in a wedding dress boutique in Portland

First of all, didn't even mention my size at all. She simply pointed to the sample size rack that I'd be looking through and helped me pick out one of each dress style. 

What happened next was magic.

I put on the full torso bra and the mermaid petticoat and began to slip into dresses. One after another, I got to see my body, my silhouette in these stunning gowns that I previously could never picture my current body in. 

I looked at myself for the first time and saw a woman, and with that cinched waist, I looked like a I had an hourglass figure. The dresses looked NORMAL on me. Simply, I looked like a bride.

I finally slipped into the mermaid dress, and when I saw myself, I began to cry. I looked stunning. The dress was perfect, it fit me so well, the corset back created the perfect silhouette and my body looked incredible. I have never said those words before. *My body looked incredible.*

She put a veil on me and I didn't have words. I never thought I'd be the woman crying over a dress or speechless because of a veil

I walked out of there happy. I did not purchase a dress, just to make sure, but I have a general idea of how each type of dress looks on my body. I no longer fear dress stores. The size stigma is always going to be there, but in my head now, knowing if something fits you correctly, it is going to look better. I might not ever be a size 4 bride. I might not even be a size 14 bride, but I know that I'll look my best and I'm even excited to purchase my dress.

Hi everyone!

I love this subreddit. Needs to be said up front. I'll probably say it again later on because I can't help myself. I have never found a place on the Internet that has a wider variety of brides who are all genuinely supportive of each other and sincerely helpful. Forums on the Knot, strictly adherent to ""rules"" for rule's sake, and Pinterest-level expectations of the final ""product"" (I say that sarcastically, because I think we all know here that a wedding is not a ""product"", but in fact, a pretty fucking special occasion). Hell, we even have DUDES on here

I'm so happy when I come here for a day and see a lot of self-posts. People sharing tips that I hadn't thought of. People with problems that I've faced myself and I can assist with. People with in-law trouble who just want a shoulder to lean on. I think *that* is the difference between /r/wedding and /r/weddingplanning. 

But we go through phases... one person will post their ring, please do not misunderstand me), but don't really provide a lot of insight into the wedding planing process, challenges we face, wins we want to celebrate, etc. We eventually (politely, because our mods are awesome) asked people to post their rings on /r/justengaged instead. But lately it's been all about venues and dresses. Which if it was done in moderation

I love this sub and think it has a distinct service to offer that gets easily lost in a lot of image posts. So just a few thoughts

* **Allow 'brag'-type image posts just one day a week** (ala what /r/TwoXChromosomes does with Fridays). Maybe it's Friday, engagement shots, rings, etc. These posts are still helpful, for ideas and inspiration. But we do have access to Pinterest for that. So maybe just limit them to once a week here on this super-wicked-awesome sub?
* **Images would still be allowed as replies to posts on any day of the week.** So it's not like you couldn't respond to someone with ""well, etc.
* **Requests for help in finding a specific dress, etc, would still be allowed any day of the week.** So someone who is looking for a green dress could still post a picture of a green dress and ask if anyone's seen something similar. 

**Bottom line: Brag/Check Me Out image posts are awesome

Thanks for your time! It would be great to see this upvoted for visibility (it's a self-post,,False,self,t5_2rv3t,False,,True

I do not want kids at my wedding. I felt it was rude to include that on the invitation. That and I did not have the space anywhere to include it. I went with the understanding that how you address the invitations is how you let your guests know who was included in the wedding. If it's addressed to ""Mr. &amp; Mrs. Jones"" then that's who's invited. If it's addressed ""Mr. &amp; Mrs. Jones and family"" that means bring your kids! I heard through the grapevine that my FH's father is just telling his side of the family to bring kids. An uncle and aunt were speaking to my FH's father and not us (I've reached out to his family before the invites went out as a way of introduction as we've never met. They know how to contact me. They should have contacted me.) We headed if off before it got too far and FH told dad ""we don't have the space for kids. We have space for the people that are specifically called out on the invitation"". APPARENTLY F-FIL took that as ""If my wife and I give up our seats at the reception then the kids can come."" Lo and behold we got a response card back with the aunt, F-FIL is not paying for our wedding. It is in no way his place to tell people they can come. He can tell them to get a hold of US as it is OUR wedding anyway. We'd be the ones with the answers to the questions. 

Today was my hair and make-up trial. I've been going to this woman for years and have always loved what she does with my hair. She had an idea for an updo. I was weary of it but I let her try it because I trust her. That and I wanted to see it for myself before saying no. When it was all said and done I hated it. The placement of the veil was not what I wanted either. I bucked up and said I didn't like it. I wanted my hair and veil lower on my head. To my amazement the world didn't end! She shrugged and said no problem. Did a quick trial of another updo and I loved it.

Due to Circumstances, in a surprisingly calm voice, that he wanted nothing to do with his son anymore, that my fiance wasn't his son anymore, that he was not welcome back home, that he was never to call or talk to his family again. He noted that if my fiance's sister attends the wedding, the dad will cut her off financially (she's still in school). And then he hung up.

Similarly, and while he still talks to me, the mere mention of a wedding will cause him to shut down and hang up the phone.

We're dealing. These are experiences we knew we'd have to go through, or if my dad ultimately gets dragged by my mom and then makes a scene or condemns us to an eternity in hell.  And we're figuring out whether or not we want to include their names in our program, etc.

We planned every detail ourselves, but it all ended up amazing.

With that said

1. **Set a budget first.** It was awkward, don't count on it at all. 

2. If you're like us, **give them a trusted contact that will take care of all day-of communication**. I actually had a vendor come up to me to discuss the terms of our contract **during the event.** This caused me undue stress during an otherwise stressful time, and had I given him a contact he could have talked business all he wanted and I could have been saved the stress.

3. **Go on a honeymoon immediately.** Due to our budget, one or two nights in the Hampton Inn by the interstate could do the job. My point is it's not about luxury, it's about decompressing with your spouse. Watch TV. Read. Go to a restaurant. I found what we did 90% of the time was talk to each other about our little stories about the wedding weekend, and reminisce on what will become the best memories of our life. 

 **EDIT:** But can't you do this at home? Yes and no. When we got home, no meals to be cooked, no garbage to take out etc.

It's all about this one stupid thing people keep telling me. This phrase is *killing* me, do what you want!""

It seems like whenever *any* issue related to weddings comes up, from relatives--I don't know why the world is suddenly acting like it's okay--no, expected--for me to ""get my way"" and ""do what I want."" I feel like when people tell me, ""It's YOUR day!! You should do it the way YOU want to!"" there is some kind of expectation that I'm going to throw a fit if I don't do what I want. I'm not a little kid--I understand that things cost money, that certain things aren't possible, that there are things called budgets and families that make things more difficult. I feel like when people tell me that I should do what I want because it's MY day, they discount my ability to act as a rational adult. If part of being a rational adult is being able to throw an event that is enjoyable for not only you but your guests as well while still keeping within a budget...well, damnit

It also seems to happen a lot online, but it's also really not helpful. Yes, it is your wedding, and you should strive to throw a wedding that is what you want. But as all of us know, there are a million little considerations that go into throwing a wedding--if I was really just doing whatever I wanted, it would be damned inconvenient for everyone else, which is definitely not okay. I honestly can't think of anyone who hasn't had to make some compromises in wedding planning--why pretend otherwise? 

So, where we aren't expected or forced to throw certain types of weddings. But I also feel like pretending that the only thing that matters is what I want is ridiculous.

1361033578.0,18n5vp,I am a graphic designer at a print shop who keeps seeing the same design/printing mistakes being made by DIY brides.  I'd like to help you out! AMA,punkusamericanus,68,7,39,"I have worked with a lot of DIY brides with their wedding printing.  I've designed and printed just about anything printed for weddings; save the dates, programs, wedding schedules

What I have run into, who doesn't know a lot about printing processes or setting things up to print. I want to help you save money and a lot of stress by giving you some tips on designing/printing.


* First
Let me share some stories with you to explain.

    -Some of those wedding invitation packages you can buy at Michaels or JoAnns have vellum paper in them - which is okay to run on your home printer

    -Another bride came into my shop with an example of what she wanted (black ink on a shimmery ivory cardstock) and asked for some quotes on digital printing.  I loved her for it because she knew exactly what she wanted and even had an example.  I quoted her on supplied paper, she returned with BLACK paper -she had impulsively changed her mind at a paper store- and asked if I could print on it.  I told her I could, but the printing cost would change because it would have to run it through an ink-press vs. digital printer.  The quote ended up being WAY out of her budget and she could not return the paper she bought. She was definitely upset with no one but herself.


* Be early.  If you want to send out your invitations in September
Furthermore


* Be organized.  Bring in examples of what you want.  Measure the sizes of the finished project.  Bring it your dress swatches from David's Bridal. Figure out how many invites you need.  This is one time where you will be admired and thanked for being an assertive Bridezilla.  


* If you want to DIY but don't know how to design, why wouldn't you pay a professional graphic designer to help you make your custom wedding invitations?  If you bring examples of what you like to your designer, and be very specific of what you like, there shouldn't be any problem for them to recreate it exactly how you like it. And it really isn't that expensive...a lot of places would charge between $25-$50 for design.


* Regarding etiquette and wording on your invites: it's totally up to you how you want to word it.  There's no right or wrong way to word invites anymore...I've worked with formal invites and very non-traditional brides. If it is really important to you

1366290737.0,1clq9f,My experience with David's Bridal,julio--,62,4,22,"Over the past month or so, get it altered there too. I had my final fitting yesterday and I have to say that this wedding dress experience has been nothing but positive! I'll share my story so that hopefully other brides won't shy away from what might be a great experience for them as well.

I'll preface this by saying that I'm a plus-sized bride who has lost 35lbs since buying my dress in December (going down from an 18W to probably a 14W). I live about 9 hours from where I bought the dress

Just days after we got engaged last March, but not plain. I didn't know anything about our wedding plans yet, but as it turns out, I would need something light and flowy for our destination wedding. This dress was everything I was looking for.

Fast forward to December, David's Bridal. I put off my dress shopping for as long as possible because of my body issues, and also because I live 9 hours away from my mom and MOH. I came prepared with five wedding dress choices loaded on my iPad, which I think really helped and sped up the process since I was aware of what they had and what I wanted to try. My consultant, Sam, was so helpful and made me feel beautiful and worthy throughout the whole process. What I didn't like about David's though, is that they have no mirrors in the changeroom

Dress after dress came out and nothing was working. Where was my #1 dress? It turns out they don't have my dress in my sample size. Instead, that she would work with me to find something else I loved. I took comfort in that, but still felt like I was taking the biggest risk in my life. 

Two weeks later, so perfect, and so me. I got tears out of my usually stoic mother!

David's Bridal in Port Huron

I felt trepidation about getting my dress altered at the Ottawa, Canadian, and unfamiliar to me. I haven't lived here long, so I don't know much about seamstresses around the area, so I thought that David's was my best option.

I had my first alterations appointment on March 5, but I kept positive.

Last Friday, waist, and hips since March 5. Oops! The dress was noticeably loose and I started to hate the way it made my body look. I had a more experienced seamstress pin the dress, and then I could see my body emerge! I looked fantastic in the dress and it accentuated all my hard work.

I saw my gown in a magazine ad while awaiting our plane home from our trip to Disney (where he proposed). I found the Rapunzel gown and was devastated because I HATED it. I decided before completely writing it off I'd try it on. A few weeks later [I did](http://i.imgur.com/BI0TEky.jpg). And I LOVED IT.
 
I had lost some significant weight the year before and was around 145

January of this year I was in Texas for work and staying with my fiance's sisters. We went shopping for my veil to match my gown. They put me in a size bigger than I ordered and [this](http://i.imgur.com/oikphzr.jpg) is what that [looked like](http://i.imgur.com/f0CiBjo.jpg). I'm about 180 lbs there. I'm not saying that it's the end of the world but I worked really hard to lose the weight and I was mad with myself for putting it all back on so quickly. I've never had to worry about my weight for most of my life

On the car ride home (Connecticut to New York state) my mother reminded me that I had the undergarments on this time, my mom was getting nervous with the digital camera. 

TL;DR: This wedding planning process has made me look at myself in a whole new light. I'm no longer worrying about ""one more pound"".

Good luck and best wishes.

Some tips - 

Relax and breathe. Realize things will get forgotten. We wanted to put out dry erase boards for our photo booth. I bought them and it was only upon arriving at the venue that I realize I forgot them completely. Afterwards, reminders, phone alarms, strings around your fingers. My grandmother was pretty upset that I forgot the mailbox for notes and cards, but that was mainly because she's high society Southern so she was just worried I missed out on money.

You can get mad later. There are things that are going to bug you, call her in a few days or when you get back from the honeymoon and give her what-for.

Make sure your photographer and all the vendors know exactly what you want and where it needs to be! I failed to put a few must-have photos on the must-have photo list, but I'm married to my best friend, so I'll be okay. It does you no good to give your coordinator a blank chalkboard and tell them NOTHING about what you want them to do with it.

Be sure to ask most of your guests for their cell phone pics individually because for some reason

If you can afford it, which she did, except the camera had some sort of malfunction and won't actually, you know, play the tape. Deep down, part of me WILL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF for not making official arrangements.

Lastly, to where you have to sit in the lobby and wait until the processional ends. Well, so my dad and I walk out there and I just see here and we both start kind of happy-crying. She says ""you look so pretty!"" And my coordinator asked her to get on the other side of the door. My best friend for almost half my life got to open the door for me to see my husband for the first time. I could have been snarky, but I loved our friendship and even included her in my thank yous later that night. I got my best friend back.

Just by looking at it

However! About a week ago, just some simple alterations needed"". The minute the seamstress (an extremely experienced lady who has been doing wedding dress alterations for over 15 years) saw it, she had a look of disgust on her face. ""Where did you get this dress?"" she said, and I sheepishly replied ""A seamstress from China"". She knew it, she tore the dress apart. Even though from looking at it any normal person would think it was amazing quality, from a seamstresses perspective it was far from it. When I tried it on, I hadn't even tried to sit down in it - she prompted me to do that and I seriously couldn't even sit down without it feeling like it was going to bust at the seams. Why was I so stupid? It looked so gorgeous, but I felt duped. 

She said that when she normally charges $100-$200 for alterations, it would be very difficult. She said, ""I don't want to be the person to tell you this, but you need to get another dress. I can make you look decent, but you will never look stunning. You deserve to look stunning."" I was so crushed, you have no idea. I felt sick. 

So I had to rush around and after two days of going around to countless stores, I get that) and that initially I said that it fit fine, just big in the top. I explained that I had no idea the work that needed to be done to make it fit normally, as I am not a seamstress, and I thought it would be easy to remedy. 

This whole thing has been a nightmare from beginning to end really. I am so disappointed that I had faith in a dress I had never tried on. I don't know why I would put such an important purchase in the hands of someone I had never met. I'm sorry if my first post persuaded anyone to buy a dress from her

The only upside to this situation is that I found the dress of my dreams. I am thrilled with it. I am just crossing my fingers that Wonderxue will refund the dress that they made me. If not, I should have just kept looking for a dress that would fit into my budget and still make me feel beautiful. There is a reason that first dress that started it all, the Justin Alexander, cost what it did.

And here are some thoughts/hopefully helpful hints on their creation:

All of the paper I procured at [Paper Presentation](http://www.paperpresentation.com/). I spent a while comparing prices here

The stamps for our address, I shopped around a while and their prices, turnaround time, and the ease of their online stamp maker thing was unbelievable. Each of our stamps was around $7.00.

The bakers twine I got from [Whisker Graphics](http://whiskergraphics.com/). They were having a sale at the time, some of which I purchased, but didn't end up using.

---------

Everything was hand lettered/illustrated by me (I used gouache and various artists inks)

One thing I figured out early on was to work at a much larger scale (at least for the handwriting) and then make it smaller in photoshop

The designing/illustrating process alone was very time consuming. I'm sure I spent at least 100 hours on that alone, to save money or what not, make sure to do it as cheaply, stress-free, and honestly as lazily as possible while still striving for a quality product. I would probably have DIYed my invites even if I wasn't so fond of paper and such, but if that were the case they would have been much simpler and less time consuming. Did we need a wedding map with ~~my favorite~~ the only coffee shop in town? Certainly not, but I really wanted to make said map

-----
 If you're undertaking a large invitation suite, etc.) listed with the paper color, dimensions, where the paper was coming from, how much I spent, etc. Having the paper color and dimensions was key though. Listing the paper colors helped me figure our color balance, and the dimensions let us know how much of everything we needed/how we could print the most things on the fewest sheets of paper. 

ALWAYS order extra. At the time of ordering

Finally, and I would say each thing took us an entire night to do. For instance one night we did all the stamping of envelopes and luggage tags, the next night we glued invitations together, etc.

The thing that went the most terribly wrong for us, was too big to fit in the envelopes I ordered. After some deliberation, and attempted fixes, we decided to make our own envelopes, and in the end I actually like them better!

Finally, was the most fun I've had working on our wedding so far. I really felt like I could see our marriage in the works, if that makes sense.

Digital! Although


* *What did you study in school?*

Studio Art with a concentration in Photography


* *How many weddings do you shoot per year?*

Between 20 - 25


* *Do you recommend using two photographers (a lead and an assistant

YES. I personally never shoot alone, do it. That being said, make sure that the photographer you're hiring is also more than capable of shooting alone. 


* *Do you include a disc of images

Yes. Each package includes access to all professionally edited wedding images with personal rights to the images.


* *Do you suggest having an engagement session done?*

Yes. It's a great way to get to know your photographer


* *What questions should I make sure to ask when interviewing photographers?*

Are they insured? Do they have backup equipment? What EXACTLY is included in your package (meaning, but it takes seeing a FULL wedding to really get an idea of their style.

I'll add more as I think of them!

1365225142.0,1bs6mx,"I ordered my dress from Wonderxue, a seamstress from China, via etsy. It arrived today. Here is my experience!",OVbunEN,58,49, particularly the seller [""wonderxue""](http://www.etsy.com/shop/wonderxue?ref=shop_sugg). I did

Back in January I had started looking for my dress. I ended up trying on #8641 by Justin Alexander and fell in love with it, as my entire wedding alone is only going to cost around $6000. There was NO way I was going to spend almost a third of my budget on the dress. No way. So I started looking at alternate options and found the shop called ""wonderxue"" on etsy.

I sent a message to the owner of the shop, and she said it would be no problem. I went to a local alterations place and had my measurements professionally done, sent those to Yuan and paid for the dress. It cost $490 + $35 shipping. I also bought a mantilla veil from her for $30 that she shipped with the dress.

There were a few hiccups along the way. For example, so naturally I started worrying, second guessing myself and quite frankly, freaking the fuck out. I was scared that my dress wouldn't come in time for alterations (I just had a baby, so my body is still fluctuating quite a bit). Then last weekend she sent me pictures of the finished product and said she would mail it this past Monday. It came TODAY! I was blown away that it got here from China in less than a week, and all in one piece.

Let me just say that the four month wait, and it fits like a glove (except in my boob area, but I'll get that altered soon). I am seriously amazed that I paid 1/4 of the price for this dress that looks like the same thing I tried on in the designer boutique. It feels GREAT, and the materials she used are beautiful. I really don't know if I would be able to tell the difference between this dress and the designer version if the two were held up together. They both fit the same, feel the same, etc. I would do this all over again in a heartbeat. 

My only suggestion for any of those thinking about doing this is to not wait until the last minute. Yuan is getting a lot of negative feedback lately from pissed off customers who didn't get their dress in time, but to get any necessary alterations done once you get it , it is well worth it to go this route. 

I put together this [album](http://imgur.com/gallery/ZL0Go/new) of pictures for you guys so you can see the original and her remake of the dress.

I made a hair appointment for a cut and style for a few hours before

THAT WAS A HUGE MISTAKE. When I got there, and once I sat down with her, I told her I wanted her to cut off as little hair as possible (I've been growing it for over two years, I used to have a pixie cut). SHE CUT OFF ALMOST 3"". By the time I realized she was cutting off too much, it was too late. To make matters worse, when she styled it, she used a huge curling iron and it looked like I was going to prom or something. I came home from the salon in tears

Later, wasting a good half-hour of light and time in the library. I was in heels, and we were both carrying lots of stuff for the shoot. It's a really confusing campus if you aren't familiar with it, and I should have given her more specific directions on where to park and how to get to the library. By the time we found each other, FH and I were sweaty, my heels were killing my feet, and we only had an hour to work with until the library closed. Between that and my hair

- Don't stress out. Seriously, musician was afraid her new boyfriend was going to beat him up or something, so he asked if someone else could play with him. Upside - 2 musicians for way cheaper than usual!! 2. Two months before the wedding, one bridesmaid applies for a job in another state, gets said job, and has to move and probably won't be able to come back for the wedding. Luckily, my niece was willing to step in, it wasn't even noticeable that she was added last minute. 

- Use the [Wedding Party App](https://www.weddingpartyapp.com/) (or something similar). We have so many pictures that we will treasure that are from different perspectives other than the photographer. 

- Be comfortable with your photographer. We used the same photographer for engagement pictures (2 sessions), which kept it fun. 
 
- (My only [small] regret) Give yourself plenty of time, but it didn't give us near enough time to socialize with everyone at the wedding (it was about 185 people). 

- Breakaway bouquet!! It was so fun to see the shock on those ladies faces!

- Just have fun. By around 10:30

What? Why.  Why would you do that.  Does Work Friend have a wife? Yes? Then you just invited two more people, but that's 'cause I'm paying them to set up the food). And not only his mom is worried about rudeness, he wants to have a completely open bar because ""just open beer, wine and soda isn't enough, it's just awful and people will  hate us."" 

He  ended up  inviting 8  extra people, we'd fit them into the ceremony (which has room for 100 to sit, and standing room for about 10-15 in the back). 

This put our final final guest  list to 112

So I was going through the list, one for the ceremony and one for the reception, and only list the invited names  for each occasion on the cards, to help clear up confusion). 

And I had a thought...there are several people we *know* will not attend. 

 One of his aunts is bed bound with severe MS and lives over 600 miles away. Another aunt is 95 years old and, in a *very* rural area. She has caretakers come in daily to cook for her and so on. I doubt his foster brother (that he hasn't seen in years and hasn't spoken to regularly in over a year), her wife that he's never met, and the foster brother's nephew (again, never met) are going to travel over 600 miles.  Then there's a family of three who, while they were close next door neighbors, probably won't attend because the husband has been suffering from a neurological problem that hospitalized him, they still don't know what happened and he's  doing monthly testing.  They're not going to want to travel so far with his health being so unpredictable  and the medical expenses they're dealing with. 

Then my grandfather and his step daughter, especially since my grandmother is invited and their divorce was *not* amicable. 

That's like, for someone they haven't seen or spoken to in a long time. 

So I realized we can just go ahead and invite everyone, right? No one's getting snubbed by only receiving a reception invite, his four friends won't be confused about wondering if they got ""bumped up"" to ceremony and reception, etc.  

Nope. He  flipped out.  He thoroughly believes that these people will come.  He actually got offended that I'd even *think* they wouldn't attend. He insists we keep the list with some people invited to just the reception.

I talked to his mom

It was challenging, but it turned out to be a really valuable exercise for both of us in thinking about why we're good with each other and what we can both promise to work on.  If we'd gotten around to pre-marital counselling this may have been unnecessary but since we didn't I'm glad we wrote our own.

**2. We didn't try to hide me or the gown from him ahead of time**

Oh my god I cannot even begin to contemplate what an utter flaming pain in the ass it would have been to try to keep me hidden.  This tradition wasn't important to either of us to start with and luckily none of the parents cared either, it meant we could just do all the prep in the same location, and nobody had to be constantly on guard to prevent us seeing each other.  (Edit: Plus we're each others' best stress relievers, so it was great to be able to spend the morning chilling and snuggling, especially since we were both too wound up to sleep much.)

**3. We provided transportation for guests**

Our venue was a bit of a drive away from where people were staying, but they were very grateful for it.  I was glad we did because if not I would have worried about guests either potentially driving drunk, or not taking the opportunity to enjoy themselves fully.

I know that my friend isn't obligated to plan around me, and her wedding. Another of her bridesmaids has already said she can't attend, along with much of her and her fiance's extended family. 

What should I do? Take out a loan to attend? Skip my honeymoon? Skip her wedding? Is there anything I can say to her to make this easier?",self,t5_2rv3t,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1jvw6c/help_my_friend_and_i_are_both_engaged_and_i_cant/

Restaurants that could be rented out for a small ceremony/dinner? 

Reasonably priced photographer?

Guitarist/Singer that we could hire to play a song at the ceremony?

This lead me to Vistaprint (Canada). The more I look around the site the more money I seem to be able to save so I figured I'd pass on some tips for other brides looking to use the service. This might work for other similar companies as well.

1) Sign up for an account and save the designs of everything and anything you could ever want from the site... even if it's out of your budget range.

2) Be careful with packaged invitations! $185 for 50 invites and RSVP cards doesn't sound too bad but if you drop the package deal and add the items separately with PLAIN envelopes

3) Be patient! If you look like you are interested in becoming a customer (by saving designs and items) they will want your business. Within 7 days I had an e-mail offering me 10% off the stuff I had saved and some other little offers for additional items (business cards

4) Be VERY patient! Within 30 days of creating my ""order"" I had a 50% off coupon for all invites in my e-mail. Now that I have some play room

1375052855.0,1j8ov6,Everything you always wanted to know about wedding ring tattoos but were afraid to ask.,,46,7,18,"[(Our tattoos.)](http://imgur.com/a/xx2cD#0)

There's a sad lack of resources on wedding ring tattoos on the web. Sites like The Offbeat Bride recycle the same set of pictures

That's why I thought sharing our experience might come in useful. Of course

**Demographics**

To give you some idea of which niche we fit

**Design**

Fingers are not ideal places for ink. You need a design symbolic of a ring rather than an actual ring, so no looping around the finger. A good artist will know what works. Ask them for ideas.

Interestingly
 
**Procedure**

R/tattoos has excellent advice on choosing a good shop. The pain is light. Our tattoos just stung on the sides

Then irritation and swelling set in

**Environment**

We were nervous about getting a visible tattoo

We found most people didn't really care. Some loved it. Some hated it. That's just something you have to accept.

Don't count on covering them for work or family. A big signet ring will obscure them

**Permanence**

Your tattoo is pretty much *permanent*. Laser removal may leave scarring and is a health hazard. Accept that if you split

My wife and I lived together for 9 years before marrying

**In closing...**

The bottom line is, make it a big one and wear it proudly.

I hope this was of some use to someone.  If you have any more questions... Shoot.

-Our wedding is in December so she said book a florist now as December is a busy season and it helps the florists to plan how much they will need to order. She said I can pay a deposit to book the services but I shouldn't have to finalize choices until October. 

-A good florist will ask what the brides waist size is suggest bouquets based on that rather that dress size since dress sizes can vary. (I never even thought of a florist asking for my waist size) She said someone with a tiny waist and huge bouquet looks off in pictures as does someone with a larger waist and a tiny boquet. She said ax experienced florist will make a bouquet that compliments the bride. 

-Make sure in your contract the # of flowers are stated. Your contract should say not only ""Bridal Bouquet with white roses"" but rather it should say ""Bridal Bouquet with 14 white roses""

-Be careful about going with a friend or someone that does flowers on the side for out of their house because they don't have the proper storage and usually the flowers will need to be ordered at the last minute and if there is something wrong with the order its harder to correct the problem with less time.

-If you are getting arrangements made for your ceremony try and get something you can use to also decorate the reception with to get more use for your money. Bridesmaid bouquets can be put in holders and used to decorate the cake table for example. 

-Before meeting with your florist regarding centerpieces (or if your centerpieces are DIY) don't make any final decisions until you ask your venue if there are any restrictions. Some venues don't allow candles or only allow certain types of candles or candle holders for example. 

-She suggested for a winter wedding that pewter and black are good colors for bridesmaids dresses and can choose a wide variety of colored flowers and they won't clash.

Unfortunately, going easily upwards of $1000. I did see one or two Groupons for something like $400 for two hours, but that seemed like an awful lot to pay for only two hours!

I did some searching online and found some people had done DIY booths

**[Here's what I built](http://imgur.com/a/Wdwgv)!**

[These are the instructions](http://diy.weddingbee.com/topic/diy-photobooth-using-pvc) that I used to model my booth off of. I used the photo to figure out which pieces I needed and about how much pipe - the only difference was that I added a second shelf (for more room and extra support).

A friend of mine was willing to lend me his PVC pipe cutter

Putting it together was mostly a matter of looking at the photos from the example I used

Then I went to JoAnn's and got fabric to cover the booth with. I used velcro both on the fabric and on the PVC pipe to cover it all. The fabric, but I wanted the fabric to match the colors we're using for the wedding.)

For the pictures, and a webcam (all of which I already own), along with software called [Sparkbooth](http://sparkbooth.com/) which is $60 (well worth it - it makes the process really simple for your guests and you can have it automatically print photos to a photoprinter or upload to a website or whatever).

I still have to figure out lighting - there's no flash with the webcam so it's definitely necessary. Right now my plan is to try a Halogen work light and some sort of light softener. And I plan to make signs for the booth.

After I put it together

Basically so far, so a total project cost of $350. Not as cheap as I was hoping honestly, but still significantly cheaper than most of the prices I saw, and we can use it for as long as we want. I'm thinking of selling it or renting/lending it afterwards.

First piece of advice? GET A DAY OF COORDINATOR! It was the only way that we could get the reception set up the day of and make sure that everything was the way that we wanted it to be. Our wedding would not have happened without her. 

Second? Make day-of schedules to be given out to family/friends/bridal party/ groom's party / anyone who you think will ask you when things are happening the day of. Give them out at the rehearsal dinner if possible. This will seriously help keep a million people from asking what is happening when on your big day. The last thing you want is to have to check your phone a million times because everyone is calling to ask you where things are / when things start. 

Ladies - when getting your stylist make sure to get a preview done first for hair and make-up and discuss how you want your bridesmaids styles to be. This helps them figure out how much time they need. We ended up getting my stylist for about 6 hours for 6 girls total. It was perfect timing. Trust them to know how long it takes. Get reviews of them from as many people as possible. Our stylist made me and my girls so comfortable and made us feel the best we could about ourselves :)

Gentlemen - please schedule things for your groomsmen to do the day of. My husband had not done this until last minute even though everyone wanted to get together with him for lunch/brunch and hang out before the ceremony. It really helped calm him down in the end! 

Talk to your photographer and possibly walk through your venue with them - We met up with our photographer beforehand and showed him all the places we wanted to take pictures. He gave us great feedback and took notes. We also gave him a specific shot list of photos we wanted and this was AWESOME. He followed it perfectly. I also made a pinterest board of photos that I enjoyed and sent it to him. He found great ways to incorporate the creative ideas with our venue. 

MONEY - TRY TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING YOU CAN BEFORE THE WEDDING DAY! We ended up not having to pay anyone the day of. It was either pre-paid or we are paying it this week. We didn't have to worry about too many tips since we didn't hire cars. The only person I paid in cash that day was my stylist. 

Write down your vows! Don't try to memorize them. I would have stuttered and gone blank had I not had a card with my vows on it!

Last piece of advice! If you know people/have friends who can be your vendors (musician, DJ, etc) try to hire them. We ended up saving a ton of money because almost all of our vendors were people we knew. Our DJ was a groomsman (who made an AMAZING playlist), our photographer works with my husband and cut us a great deal and yes he is a professional photographer, our videographer is a friend of ours, our baker is the wife of another coworker, etc etc I think we saved a couple thousand dollars by using people we knew.

I considered posting on Facebook but the wrong people might see it and be hurt. I post it here in the hopes that I can help make your reception a better celebration. I am a wedding DJ extrordanaire. I am a master at planning the timing and pacing of a reception. I can see how every decision you make is going to affect the energy of the party

Your guests are there to celebrate, like cutting the cake or the parent dances, your guests will get ancy but they won't dance because you haven't done your part to tell them the party is starting now. 

Are there exceptions? Sure. Some people might get up and dance when they hear a great song, and one where you just start dance music after dinner and the one where you start with the formalities will be first to a full dance floor every time. 

Being present also means you must embrace the spotlight and accept that there are times when the action is fully centered around you and the party cannot move forward without your participation. A good DJ (or band leader) will check to make sure you are ready before announcing something that you need to be a part of, get to the dance floor, and if dad isn't there already or on his way, go *get* him!

Don't jump in the photo booth with your bridesmaids first. Don't go to the bathroom. Don't go to the bar to get another drink. All of these things should be planned around the important moments. 

Imagine watching the Oscars and when Hugh Jackman announces the winner of best actress the camera cuts to the back of Glenn Close's head

It's so simple and yet so important that you be present, and better memories if you just do this one thing for me. Please, I beg you, help me to help you. 

That is all. We now return you to your regularly schedule discussion of dresses and venues.

So, and had nothing to say except snarky remarks about ""How quickly"" he ""settled"". What?? We've been together 2 years and friends for 10, dude. Not to mention that she was already engaged at this point with no wedding date in sight. 

So, so he wanted to let me know now instead of letting me find out at the last minute. 

Needless to say, as he is at work and I don't want to have this conversation over the phone.

This wouldn't be a big deal if we didn't have pretty much ALL mutual friends and if we weren't both doing this out of the home state of most friends. Even having the weddings within a few months of each other would be difficult if you account for travel expenses and vacation time @ work. 

So far I have booked the ceremony venue and the photographer, and only if there is availability. I have not sent out invites yet, thank goodness! They are ready to send, but not sent. I HAVE sent save-the-dates, though, and what a hassle it is going to be to change our dates. 

**Here is my plan:** She wants to get married on Friday? Fine. I will get married on Saturday. This way

**Here is my fear:** She finds out and changes her dates

**Here is the other issue:** She refuses to talk to me. We used to be close friends until I ended our friendship on the basis of her cheating on my now-fiance. She was pretty scandalous

**Here is another part of the plan:** My fiance is very close to her parents

Oh

Any advice? 

**Resolution: First off, I told him what was up and he immediately said ""I'm calling Mary (her mom)."" While most people said it would cause drama, like I said, they are super close. Anyway, Mary was super receptive and even said her daughter started pushing for this date all of a sudden, being really stubborn about it even though it's just a couple of months away., and ""no wonder why"".**

**She is used to her daughters outbursts and fits since this is not out of character. She called us back Wednesday and said ""Don't worry, period."" I have no idea what transpired but I'm assuming her mom called her out on her BS and she was embarrassed.

I understand my (now) SIL was just frustrated at trying to pick one style that everyone would like... It doesn't exist.  Everyone has a different body type and unless you're dressing triplets who eat/exercise the same way, they have boning, some have a corset which you can tighten, etc...  Strapless is in and it's cute, but it's not for everyone.  If they pick the same one on their own, consider yourself a winner and go buy some lotto tickets before that luck runs out!

I feel like this is a phase that many people have during wedding planning, and making me want to strangle people that I love. I'm really trying to keep it cool, and I'm generally a laid back person, but I totally get why some people turn into Bridezillas. OMG.

1) Be picky about your photographer, but my parents insisted on getting us pros as a wedding present.  For one thing, it's great to have everyone we love (including the photographer friends/relatives) in the photos!  Plus, they appreciated not having to work during the celebration.  And our photos came out AMAZINGLY well!  We have about 700 of them, and the rights to print as we please.  After hearing countless horror stories of awful wedding photos, I'm eternally grateful to my parents and think it's worth spending extra on!

2) Hire a professional DJ (or band).  Not only will a professional be better at reading a mixed-aged crowd and playing appropriate music, and I didn't worry about when things would happen because I trusted him to work with the site coordinator.  He was worth every penny!

My one wedding regret is that I worried so much about something silly.  I'm sure everyone does this, but I married my best friend with all our friends and family there to celebrate with us, and it was AMAZING!  And we have at least two things to laugh about when remember it :-)

The three of us have been close friends for several years.  I didn't ask either of them to be bridesmaids as my fiance and I decided to have just our brothers and sisters in the wedding party (it's going to be a small wedding), and I don't remember either of them asking me about my wedding stuff at all.  In the meantime, I've asked them a few times to go with me to bridal shows, floral consultations, tastings, etc and they've always had a reason not to go, which I never really questioned until now.

About 2 months ago Friend A's boyfriend of one year broke up with her and she's been taking it pretty badly - Friend B and I have been spending a lot of time trying to help her recover.  Last weekend Friend A was having a better night than usual and I mentioned something related to wedding planning (I don't remember what)

What I don't understand is this: I'm supposed to be there for them when they go through relationship troubles (Friend B also ended a relationship about a year ago)

I've been thinking about this constantly over the last few days and it's really been upsetting me.  I just don't know how to react.  Have your single friends been responding poorly to hearing about wedding things?  Any input appreciated. 

EDIT: Thanks for all your input.  I think you guys are right - A and B are pretty immature - I think I've matured over the years we've been friends while they have not done quite as much maturing.

At that point I tried on the first 4 dresses I'd found that I liked - in a private dressing room where no one had to see me in my underwear but me (guess I bought that new strapless bra for nothing!).

I didn't really like any of them on me, so I got to take it right home with me (just need the straps adjusted, which I'm going to have done by a seamstress I've worked with before). We were in and out of the shop in about an hour.

We had a short mini-honeymoon and then I had a day to relax before going back to work.
 
And that is when I hit rock bottom.

I knew I was at rock bottom when I was listening to the song I walked down the aisle to, reading my friends' Facebook comments about my wedding pictures, and crying. *Mourning* my wedding. 

I guess the only way it could've been worse is if I had been wearing my dress too, and turned to the Internet. Surely others have felt this way before me, and luckily I found that many have.
 
Some ways I am dealing with this out-of-the-blue gloom:

**1) Tying up loose ends.** I still have Thank Yous to write, doesn't mean I have nothing to remember.
 
**2) Planning more weddings!** My brother is getting married in December. My close friend is getting married in February. I am trying my hand at day-of coordination. I can still use all the knowledge I've acquired over the past 2 years of planning to help others have wonderful weddings!
 
**3) Spending time with my parents.** One of the best parts about wedding planning was all the DIY stuff I got to do with my mom and dad. There is no reason to stop now!

**4) Be beautiful.** I really loved being fancy and pretty on my wedding day, and I want to take the time to be gorgeous for my husband.
 
**5) Take time for me.** I lost 30 lbs for the wedding and started Couch to 5K. I now have more time than ever to get in the best shape of my life.

**6) Plan for the future.** One of the best things about planning my wedding, planning our budget, couponing, etc. I am a wife now, I've got shit to do.

**7) SPEND TIME WITH MY HUSBAND!** He is an amazing and patient man

1.) If you are a budget conscious bride remember to consider the cost of gasoline. You may be doing a lot of running around a few days to a week before the wedding. I had to stop and fill up three times in the week and a half leading up the big day! That was about $120 that I hadn't budgeted for.

If you gorge on mac and cheese because it's your favorite food, you may not like yourself very much later (especially if you are trying to watch your weight in the last few days). Lots of veggies and fruit.

3.) We held our ceremony [outdoors in our backyard](http://imgur.com/40LTD), then when I reached the ""altar"" I had my maid of honor [un-bustle my dress](http://imgur.com/DEC6z) and [lay it out](http://imgur.com/tITbT) for everyone to see the detail on my small train. Just a thought for outdoor brides conscious of trying to keep their dress clean for photos.

4.) Before you get close to your day, but I knew I would stress about making sure everyone was paid on the big day. I absolutely did not want to have to think about it - so I pre-paid all my vendors 100%, other than tip, which was handled by my maid of honor. I know this is risky, and I'm not suggesting it to everyone. Be proactive about what may preoccupy you from having FUN!

5.) This isn't a new tip, take some hysterical photos, send someone to the store for a sheet cake. First dance music screwed up? Tell everyone you're going for a drink and you'll try again when it's all sorted. The point is you can't make everything perfect, but it's purely up to YOU how you process it. Take control like the beautiful, elegant bride and woman that you are.

My fiance's brother asked me the other day if he could bring his girlfriend of 2 months to the wedding. I told him I was really sorry, etc. I was really nice because I do feel bad that he won't have her there, but (as I told him) we made the guestlist, sent out STDs (lol), and invites before they started dating. He seemed fine, like he knew that what he was asking was a longshot and expected it.

Fast forward to midnight, ""You're kidding right?"" and get a, ""Nope.""

He refused to answer my phonecalls after this, because I really want to invite you now!

Of course I had a final at 7:30am the next morning, and that he'd handle it.

It took me having a meltdown in his face the next morning (between finals) but I think he's coming now. I told him that he promised his brother that he'd be there, that's her problem. This isn't about her, this is about it being our day and family.

He promised me he's coming, in a complete panic that he isn't going to show up.

1371359930.0,1gfv56,A long-ass cautionary tale: Why you need to be careful when you choose your bridesmaids,nokidsnoproblems,35,5,4,"So

Yesterday I was a bridesmaid in a good friend's wedding. She asked me to be a bridesmaid a few weeks after she got engaged, so I accepted.
Shortly after, mentioned that she should be MOH (people, just don't invite yourself into someone's wedding party and don't pressure them to give you titles). My friend, always worrying about hurting someone's feelings, indeed made her MOH.

At first I thought MOH had it together. She was in constant communication with us and seemed to be making plans. I wasn't involved in the process quite as much

Dress shopping: We were told we could choose our own dresses from anywhere so long as they were a certain length, like with some extra color or bling or whatever. She didn't get her way on that, but she and another bridesmaid did end up with the same dress and she pouted about it.

The shower came along

Bachelorette party: At first, and then said ""well now I don't know what bar to go to."" She got there, checked in, and threw some random decorations on the wall. I paid for half the hotel room and I know that bridesmaid #2 chipped in for a fourth of it. I ended up deciding which bar we went to. No big deal.

Rehearsal dinner: MOH tells me why one of my good friends hates her: ""her boyfriend kept touching me and asking for pictures of me. It's not my fault he's gotta touch this."" Seriously? Classy lady right there.

Wedding day: We were allowed to start setting up at 1pm. Ceremony started at 4pm. Three bridesmaids (and bridesmaid #2's awesome husband and mother) frantically set up the reception area, and at 2pm, declared that her makeup artist was there and she needed to go in the other room. MOH sat back getting her makeup done for the next hour and a half. It should be noted that no one else, including the bride, got their makeup professionally done, and we all had our hair done before the setup time.

At 3:30, I did all the work for the shower and bachelorette party."" Needless to say, she did not help finish setting up.

During reception: MOH didn't budge from her chair. I got most of the wedding party on the dance floor

Post reception: We had 45 minutes to break down. MOH pranced around the room

1373912849.0,1icsx8,"How should I deal with a ""one-upper""?",shesaoneupper,35,5,37,"Beware

Backstory: When I was in college I met my two best friends (We'll call them Bella and Eve) and also another girl who would hang out with us every once in a while, clothing, bragging about how many guys hit on her (this one is constant.), every little thing. She has to be better. She is genuinely a good person I think, I just can't stand her being competitive. 

Now Kim has been with her now fiance for almost five years (this fall), he's said to other people we know he doesn't even wanna get married, and it's really sad but he flirts with our mutual friends to the point where they have asked him to stop talking to him and he brags about having a crush on one of them (since I'm not that close with her, it's not my place to break that news as I have no proof that he's cheated or anything, but we all think he will someday…).

Fast forward about 4 years. My now fiancé (we'll call him Sam), she tells me I should probably tell Kim's boyfriend so he knows and is prepared for the crap he's about to get. I text him that night and then Kim the next day. They both take it well, although he tells me to take it easy on telling her as she's really wedding and baby crazy lately. Two days after I get engaged he proposes to Kim. She announces it on Facebook that next morning (before I had even announced my own and she didn't even bother to text me to tell me, but although annoying it wasn't a big deal). I announce later in the week.

Now Kim has been prying me for information about my wedding for the last month. She asks me when I'm going to have my wedding, she invites herself and her fiancé to our wedding. She insults my family when she asks what my budget is, I tell her that besides a little bit that Sam's parents are helping with, we're paying for it on our own. She asks if Im shocked my parents aren't helping. I tell her that no, they've told me forever they were not going to pay for my wedding. She says ""they can't? or they won't?"" Either way makes my family look bad. She tries to get info about my wedding out of my friends, just lots of stressful nosy annoyances from her for the past month and a half.

But the worst of it all, just inseparable when we are near each other. After we finished college Bella joined the military. She most likely would have been my Maid of Honor had she not been in the military. I'm hoping she'll still be able to be a bridesmaid, but I'm not even sure if that's possible right now. I'm okay with that, and we have both talked about it and there are no hard feelings if she can or she can't be there. So I hint around to Eve if she would be my Maid of Honor a few weeks ago. She seems to get excited and I'm pretty happy. Of course I want one of my best friends to be my MoH. So this week I go over there and give her the little bridesmaid gift and card that I made and I ask her. She tells me she has to think about it. Kim has already asked her to be her MoH and she turned to her down, and being my MoH would really hurt her feelings. Now, Eve turned her down for a few reasons. One, she tells me she isn't all that close to Kim, so Eve and I both kinda figured that she would ask her sister. The other important reason she turned her down is Kim is VERY type A. Eve was afraid she would do something wrong unintentionally and Kim would flip out and cry (she does that when things don't go her way). Eve tells me that she really wants to be my MoH

I'm getting so tired of Kim manipulating everything to go her way, another lives across the country. Bella is not sure where she'll be, and the only other bridesmaid nearby is my sister (I talked to her already, we are not that close for sisters, she's okay not being my MoH and honestly can't afford it as she's just got out of school and might have to move to another state soon for a job. I will most likely be paying for everything for her to be involved in the wedding). 

I never thought I would feel this guilty asking someone to by my MoH. I'm guess I'm just looking for an outsider's advice and perspective about this situation. ",self,t5_2rv3t,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1icsx8/how_should_i_deal_with_a_oneupper/

I have this crazy wedding idea that has the potential to be awesome. I used to work at a summer camp

Our closest guests would be traveling about an hour to get there. We would also have some people flying in from other states. The closest hotels to camp are about 20 minutes away in a neighboring town. I started to think…who’s going to want to travel all that way just for a ceremony and reception? And will we be able to spend quality time with everyone who traveled to see us get married?

So here comes my (not so?) crazy idea. What if we made our wedding into a whole weekend getaway? The camp rents out cabins to the public in the off-season. They have heat and AC, etc. But the price per person ($12-15) is pretty attractive considering that area hotels run about $100 per night or more.

So here’s my question: Would you personally be willing to participate in such a weekend? Do you think many people would? (I realize it depends on our guests

We would likely plan activities for the weekend to keep people engaged (ha) and having fun (see sample itinerary below). 

-

Friday evening:

5-7 pm: Arrive at camp, etc.

7:30 pm: Welcome dinner at local restaurant (not paid for by the couple — just a chance to casually catch up with our out-of-towners)

9:30 pm: Campfire, share stories/memories of bride and groom

-

Saturday: 

simple bagels/fruit/coffee breakfast provided by couple (there are no breakfast restaurants in the area)

11 am: weenie roast outside cabins

12 pm – 2 pm: Give people time to get ready

2 pm: ceremony at [lakefront](http://imgur.com/lVqRsiE)

3 pm: cocktail hour on porch

4:30 pm: reception at lodge

8:00 pm: start hayrack rides/campfire (our favors would probably be s’mores supplies)

My FH and I sent out invitations for 130+ guests on May 20th of this year. As of right now, which is 12 days from today. With over half of the people with no response whatsoever, we are somewhat concerned. 

In a situation such as this one
We asked people who have dealt with weddings if this is normal. The simple answer is yes. From my future MiL, she said that the same thing happened at her wedding in 1987. 

Tonight my FH and future SiL had a game night with one of her friends that got married in March

When she got people who didn’t RSVP at all on the phone, but in one instance, a family of 6 that said over the phone that they would be attending did not end up there. So she spent about $120 for people who she thought was showing up, but didn’t.

The majority of our no-RSVP is family

When you get an invitation in the mail, if needed (of course, if you want to go). Then, send back your RSVP as soon as you know you can, preferably before the listed date. 

Once you have committed to going or not, $10 could be part of their electric bill next month that they do not have to pay. Or $120 may be 3 months of cable and Internet that they do not have to pay. If anything, that is a better way of saying “Congratulations” than slapping them with a bill of something that wasn’t used. 

I want my guests to enjoy my wedding, and mail it. That's it. I don't understand how this is a problem across decades. I would appreciate if it stopped now, please.

**The wedding**:

**Getting Ready [Album](http://imgur.com/a/WOqWf)**
The wedding party stayed in a gorgeous farmhouse nearby the entrance to the park

**[Ceremony](http://imgur.com/a/95ner)**

We held the ceremony at 4:30 at this [gorgeous overlook](http://i.imgur.com/SfgZi.jpg). It had been raining all day

The wedding party entered down the aisle. I had a maid of honor and a bridesmaid, the men had brown ties, and the maid of honor wore brown. 

My dad and I came from [here](http://i.imgur.com/410fe.jpg)

We had a close friend do a reading
Then we exchanged the rings. 
The officiant  (our mutual best friend and one of the best men) pronounced us husband and wife
We were announced

The guests proceeded to the reception for a cocktail hour while we did [pictures](http://imgur.com/a/llmKJ). 

**[The Reception](http://imgur.com/a/r3YVh)**

We had no DJ

[We were announced](http://i.imgur.com/fDzHT.jpg) to the song Marry You by Bruno Mars
We went straight into our [first dance](http://i.imgur.com/6OJbV.jpg). The song was Tethered by Sleeping at Last.
Then we did the father daughter dance and the mother son dance. 
Then dinner! We didn't want to keep our guests waiting for food.
Then we did speeches, ask couples married less than a year to leave, 2 years, 5 years… etc. until there is [one couple left](http://i.imgur.com/rky0f.jpg) ) We did that to ""The Book of Love""

Then we did the [Hora](http://i.imgur.com/CRgoE.jpg). SO. MUCH. FUN.
Then dancing! No bouquet toss or garter dance. 

It was so much fun. 

**My advice:**
* Don't worry about how many bridesmaids and groomsmen you have

* If you are trying to save money

* Have a back up plan for rain. No matter what. I still can't believe some people refuse to do that. We had a shelter reserved just in case the weather didn't cooperate. Warm and dry guests are important. 

* Before you talk to anyone at the reception

* Don't stress about the small stuff. Whatever happens, even if you forget your bouquet and are 15 minutes late to the ceremony because you went back for it. Even if your hair gets messed up because the veil won't stay in. Even if you mess up your dance steps that you've been practicing forever because you've never done them in a wedding dress. Just laugh off the things that go wrong, because things WILL go wrong, and have a great time. My wedding was not perfect, but I had decided that I would not worry about anything the day of and be the most easy going bride I could be. 

* Delegate. Make sure the day of your wedding, and to a few close friends. It made things fun and everything went smoothly!

* Keep track of costs. Keeping to a budget is hard sometimes. But you can do it! Shop around

* Get started on that guest mailing list now. It takes forever to collect all the addresses.
 
* Hand address your invites. It is an extra personal touch that our guests loved. We did not pay someone to calligraphy them, BUY EXTRA ENVELOPES. Even if you do have someone address them for you, they usually require 20% extra stationary. 

* If your fiancé wants to be involved and you are the bride, most of our vendors were pretty good about that. We split up who was in charge of emailing who, and made sure everyone knew it was a joint effort. Still, people will probably comment that the groom shouldn't care, or that the day isn't about him… just be prepared and don't be afraid to correct them!

* Schedule a time and place for your photographer to take your formals. Have a back up location as well. Telling them in advance is also good. And let them know if there are any special shots you want. I also say this as a wedding photographer. 

I hope that helps! And if you have any questions

Happiest day of my life. SO many things went wrong but the only one I truly cared about was that the photo booth didn't show up.

I had contracted the photo booth with a wedding-entertainment company here in Massachusetts. Through this Company, and he also installed the (battery powered) uplighting which- seeing in person, was NOT worth the $900 I spent on it.

The photo booth was a no-show, we had also planned to use the ""Memory Book"" they provided with the service as a guest book and had no other way to ask our 170 guests to sign in.

I figured I'd wait to hear what the company had to say- perhaps something awful had happened to the driver, and the photo booth was damaged. They tried to dispatch another tech to get a replacement photo booth, but they were all in use at other weddings.

I then had an email from the president of the photo booth company telling me that while it was very sad that I had no booth at my wedding, releases them from any liability as I understand it) and that it could have been a lot worse and that I was being unreasonable asking for my money back. He also said that he doesn't represent the Photo Booth company and that I was attacking him unfairly. Up until this point, I'd had no indication that they contracted out their photo booths.

At this point

I guess I'm wondering what you all would do in this situation. In my anger, the DJ was great but didn't have great things to say about the company). I did tell the president that I would be happy to involve my lawyer but he accused me of threatening him.

I've also left him a voicemail so that we could clear up any misunderstanding... but nothing yet.

I've always loved them and I think they look cool. I dont normally wear heels and I wasn't planning to wear heels on a day that I'm going to be nervous enough. I didn't want to worry about tripping or getting stuck/losing a shoe when I walk on the grass. I honestly did not believe my guests would think about them negatively.

So I go to a seamstress, just the ones I already had on and I explained they'd be brand new) and she literally berated me for 15-20 minutes about my shoes and why I need to wear heels and ""nice shoes"", not ""sneakers"", and it progressed into getting my hair done and wearing Spanx, or whatever, under my dress so I don't have ""you know, blobs everywhere"". I guess wearing Converse said to her that I don't care about my appearance, and my mom sat there and agreed with her... and all I could do was turn red and just agree and take it in hopes that they would just stop. It sucked and put me in a funk... but I'm ready to talk about it now.

SO... I know it's ""my day"" and ""do whatever you want"" but should I wear nice shoes to complete a certain look? Will brand new Converse really ruin a certain look? Are guests really going to look at my shoes under my dress? Are they *really* going to care about my footwear that much? Is she right?

1360691658.0,18dzi2,Negotiating with vendors... a few thoughts to share,catiebug,33,5,15,"Hi everyone! I've secured the last of my major vendors for my wedding and thought it might be worth it to share a few of my thoughts of the negotiating process. This is my second wedding

I also know there are a lot of vendors on this sub and would welcome you guys chiming in to agree or disagree with any of my points!

Some important notes to remember in booking and negotiating with a vendor

* **Services are not a product...** Not all DJ services are the same

* **Services can be negotiated...** There may be physical items in this deal that will never cost lower than a certain amount (flowers, Photographers, etc, are providing a service. They need to make their living and you need to not spend your life savings on a wedding. So there is a middle ground to be found. Typically prices on a website are a starting point for discussion, not ironclad.

* **Vendors are professionals...** A lot of them are very good at what they do. They really are. And it's not fair to insult them by asking for things for what could essentially be free (you wouldn't like it if someone came up to you at work and tried to get more from you than you can feasibly give). So be reasonable.

* **Some vendors are not professionals...** I spoke to a photographer who was clearly a great artist. But he had the attitude that he would be doing me a favor by shooting my wedding. He insulted photographers who charged lower prices, etc.). Just walk away. 

* **Professional vendors LIKE weddings and people...** They are curious about your story. They're excited when your fiance is involved for reasons other than he's got the checkbook. They can connect with something like ""oh we went to the same college"" or ""my wife and I also dated long distance"". That connection gets you even better service. And in rare cases (""oh we went to the same college"") got me an unexpected discount!

Negotiation notes (caveat here

* **Know where you are starting...** It's a real long shot to negotiate with the vendor whose basic package 3 or 4 times your budgeted price. Don't waste your time or theirs. Look for folks who are 1.5 to 2 times your budget and work from there. And of course

* **Know what you want... (and be reasonable)** I compared photography packages for a month before I even started contacting them. Websites, etc. During that prep time, I could clearly see some patterns. A second photographer did not *always* double the price. A professionally-produced album quite often jumped the price between $800 - 900. This helped a lot when my fiance and I sat down to really look at what we wanted. We came up with our personal package (7+ hours, 2 photographers, digital negatives with printing rights, engagement session, no album). If we weren't willing to spend a fortune, the location is beautiful and would be a great add to the portfolio

* **Price is important, the conversation is easier for both at that point. They can tell whether your style fits their style. They may connect with one or more elements of your story that makes them excited to work with you over someone else asking for that same date. 

* **Think about it...** If you get what you feel is a good price, it's reasonable for them to say they need to know sooner rather than later (like ""I can hold things until the end of the week while you decide""). But same-day decisions on an important purchase are not good. (I also recommend never buying a car the same day you first walk on the lot!). 

* **Get the offers in writing...** Make sure there is an email chain. If I spoke to someone over the phone, y, and z, for this price""). Even the most business-minded and professional of vendors gets overwhelmed with a lot of requests for information (especially early in the year). Do both of yourselves a favor and make sure there's record of the convos. Once you've narrowed down a final choice, you'll want to see a full contract. But that's a post for someone else more experienced with contracts. :)

I hope that helps anyone who is unsure about how to go about talking to vendors. For the record, so no Florist):

* DJ - Advertised for $1000
* Coordinator (""Day of"" only) - Advertised for $950
* Photographer - Advertised for $2950

1 Month ago: We sent ONE wedding invitation to the household addressed to ""Mr. and Mrs. _______ and Family"". We decided not to allow them to bring a date because we have too many cousins of dating age and already had over 400 people on our guest list. We also sent only one (not 5 all to the same address) because...HECK...wedding invitations are expensive! Not to mention stamps! However, since they had been dating seriously for so long.

3 Weeks ago: My aunt texted my mother and asked if her kids were allowed to bring a date. I told my mom to tell her no. But apparently my uncle had already asked my father, my aunt writes a scathing email to my mother regarding who should take my grandmother to the doctors that week, which leaves my mother in tears. The next morning, my cousin created a brand new Pintrest board called ""THINGS PEOPLE SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO!"" and the only thing she has posted to this day is an article on ""Wedding Invitation Etiquette"". My first reaction to all this was to immediately tell them that they are not invited any longer (all of them). It literally had me in tears because of how mean family could be to each other, for no reason at all it seemed. Not to mention, we're not close with this family. Both my parents pleaded with me not to do anything, especially not to un-invite them

My Dilemma: I'm afraid that seeing my aunt and cousin at the wedding will just bring up angry feelings, ""Thank you for being here!"" Additionally, they haven't RSVPed yet and the date is coming close. Do I call and politely ask if they are planning to attend?

I took my off-the-rack find to the woman who does my dry-cleaning (she also advertises herself as a tailor). She altered my friend's cocktail dress and it turned out really well. What happened with my dress is that she didn't measure me at all and just took out a bunch of material uniformly from the side. She sewed the front details into the dress (?) and then kept letting it out and taking it in, it's sitting too low and gives me considerable ""back cleavage"" which i didn't know was actually a thing until I saw a photograph I made her take of it from behind. In addition, it's stained from all of the wear in her tiny shop (dust from a corner, I'm assuming) and there are other issues with the buttons on the back that indicate the dress is pulled far too tight (which she protests). She failed to even hem the dress (which she was meant to do weeks ago) and the bustle isn't done. There was other work I wanted done to the neckline but that is clearly not happening. Since the shape is so messed up, I'm trying to find either a seriously talented tailor who can undo all of the work and then finish the job in less than two weeks. I was mocked for my last-minute desperation by the first company I tried phoning today and promptly gave up.

To keep things as brief as possible

1. Mother of the Bride is ALSO getting married this year. It was going to be in July (about a month before her daughter)

2. The first thing we did together was go to a wedding expo. They both entered a raffle for prizes and Bride won a $1500 certificate for a photographer (approximately 3 hour session). Mom was trying to be slick and tell Bride that she *already* had a photographer and she should give the certificate to her! Bride was ready to hand it over because she didn't want to her her whine

3. At the Expo, you and I have to go to the boutique soon."" Since I was trying to observe her and see how I was going to handle her personality, I didn't say anything at that moment.

4. Wedding dress selection day: Mom *also* selected her dress that day because remember

Which brings us to today. Today was simple. We had already elected the bridesmaids dresses and color. All we needed to do was find the right size and order them. Mom insists she comes along. Fine. First of all, she spends the entire time looking at dresses and shoes for herself. She manages to get a word in when she wants to shoot down one of my ideas, and then goes to try on some hooker heels. And of course the last blow is completely ignoring me when we're all saying good bye. Bride tries to call her back and make her say goodbye; I tell her to not bother and I simply walk to my car and drive away.

I sincerely don't care if she doesn't like me and I have no interest in pretending to like her, but Bride can tell when her mother is pissing people off. I'm trying my best to keep the stress off of her because she deserves it and I want her and my cousin to have the best day, but it's entirely possible that she is going to make me bring out my petty, vindictive side.

Yesterday an acquaintance of my mom's (she's met this person once) came over and gave us a wedding gift of $200 because she had heard from a mutual friend that I'm getting married.  I've never met this lady. I've never even heard of this lady until my mom gave me the gift and card from her. My mom is now insisting that I have to invite her and her husband to the wedding (my mother is paying for the wedding). 

I don't want them there at all. I have no clue who these people are. I don't want to deal with redoing the tables to find a place where they might fit in. Is it an etiquette thing that I have to invite them just because they gave us cash? Or can I just send them a thank you card and leave it at that?

Before I say anything else, both at the time and with what I'm about to go into.

So

**Tux trying on day:** from 1pm-roughly midnight. Tuxes, but I really felt like from what my fiancé described that it was a forced invitation that he didn't really want to give because he felt bad. So, I told my fiancé that I didn't want to basically self-invite myself to the thing and declined. People outside of the wedding party are invited to the bar hopping, but I am not.

**Rehearsal dinner:** not invited

**Cabin:** wedding party only

**Reception dinner:** technically invited

So that's the list. Again

However

I'm thrilled for my fiancé to go, really hurt. Only one other person in their entire wedding party has an SO. It honestly doesn't seem like a big deal to me to add 2 extra people to something like the rehearsal dinner, but that could just be me. Then when it comes to the reception... I know everyone in the wedding party, the groom's parents, and the other SO (but she and I aren't close at all). And that's it. So I will be sitting, alone, for the entire weekend, but I just don't want to go to any of it. I'd rather stay in my own home and have a getaway weekend on my own or with girlfriends than to go 4 hours away to sit and be miserable all weekend.

On the other hand, please let me know if you have any advice, and if I'm being ridiculous again. I'm almost sure I'm being more ridiculous/selfish/etc. this time than last time.",,False,self,t5_2rv3t,,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1arub2/update_my_fiancé_is_invited_to_friends_wedding/

I will preface this by saying that I have never had any real issues with my future in-laws in the ~7 years I have been with my fiance...until this weekend. 


We started making the guest list over a year ago. At that time, just bad business practices) and my mom could have sued him for it. There is bad blood there. My mom even mentioned how she thought my future in-laws would want to invite J&amp;L, and I realized how hurt she sounded. So over a year ago, I told my FMIL that we would not be inviting them. She isn't happy about it, but she says okay. She told me she would need some time to tell her husband. I thought it had been taken care of...until the invites went out last month. 


That's when they realized that I was serious about not inviting J&amp;L. All this time, ""I'm sorry. I know they are your friends, but I'm trying to take care of my mom here. I don't want her to be uncomfortable on this big day. I don't want her to have to deal with that."" Ok. Great. No problem....until this past weekend. 


I get a call from my mom and she says, my FFIL called my parents that morning to see if J&amp;L could be invited. He gave them this whole spiel about how they are such close friends and how J&amp;L are expecting to be invited. He asked my parents to convince me to invite them. My dad said, ""No. This is denganzenabend's and her fiance's wedding. You need to talk to them about it."" I was furious. Not only had it not been taken care of, now they were trying to manipulate me and my fiance into doing what they wanted!!!


So now the future in-laws have waited so long that there is no excuse that can be used without J&amp;L thinking my mom has cancelled their invite. I don't want to give J&amp;L the satisfaction of thinking my mom is standing in the way of them coming, they could have just said, ""Sorry. We are only having family at the wedding."" But no. Fiance and I decide that we have to invite them. It's the only way to save his parents from embarrassment and my parents from a bad image. My mom truly sounds like she is okay with it. I think she wants him to see how well things are going for her, and I think she wants to ""kill him with kindness."" 


So basically, while I'm so mad at them that I don't want anything to do with them anymore. I can't help feeling manipulated, and that sense of trust and respect is completely gone right now. /rant


Thoughts? Opinions? Any advice on how to move forward from this? Am I being a bridezilla? 



TLDR: I feel that my future in-laws manipulated me into inviting my mom's shady ex-boss. They did this even after I told them a year in advance that he wouldn't be invited. I'm upset and angry. My fiance is stuck in the middle



EDIT: Wow!! I didn't expect this to blow up so much. Thanks so much for all your kind words. It's nice to know that I'm not crazy, I am upset and hurt. Yes, I have lost my trust in them. And yes, I think that they seriously broke our relationship when they refused to listen to me for *over a year* about this. But my fiance's parents have loved me and treated me as their own for nearly 7 years. I believe that is why his mom was so upset after I spoke with her about this. She realizes that she has done damage to an otherwise great relationship because she didn't want to face the awkwardness of telling their friends no.",,False,self,1362769634.0,t3_19wrt4

[Second post](http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1imokf/update_i_am_this_close_to_scrapping_everything/)

After a few awkward and painful conversations with my parents, somehow, we would be able to come up with the money, but honestly it's extremely unlikely that it will happen at this point, and I know I don't want it badly enough to ask them to go into debt for it (I know they would if I asked for it, that's how much they want to do this). It really sucks that it's come to this, but it's reality. We simply cannot afford the wedding we planned.

So, siblings, and grandparents) and our closest friends. Probably around 25 people altogether. (Basically what I've been asking for since the very beginning.) Right now we are ironing out the logistics of moving the ceremony to a smaller space, I think it'll work out nicely, actually. We are also talking about hosting a casual family barbecue in May that can double as wedding reception/graduation party before we leave for our honeymoon.

I feel like a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders. Unfortunately, because I really do love all my aunts and uncles, and I'm afraid that some people will be really hurt when we break the news to them. I think this would have been a lot easier if we had decided on a small wedding from the beginning, but now we have to backpedal and un-invite people.

So my next question is

-**future Sisiter In Law (fiances brothers swife) used to work as a pastry chef at a hotel** about 6-8years ago. She is about 32 and I'm 27yrs old.

-**she wants to start a cake-making business

-3 months later I asked her again about the cake and she says she didn't realise I wanted her to make the cake

-2 months after that

-she has mentioned that she is looki forward to making it

-**she's since made two practice cakes (over styrofoam)** to enter into a local show and one cake for a family members birthday. The two cakes came last and **I was really dismayed at the quality of them.** The cake for the birthday was **near inedible.**

-**her dad has just been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer**. I don't want to add extra stress or expectation on her.

-I haven't heard from her in about a fortnight when we previously would email each other several times a week.

-my mum is paying for a good chunk of the wedding

-my fiancé and I have had a consultation with a very good professional baker who specialises in wedding cakes

-I was planning on (and have started) making my own gumpaste decorations for the cake but it's getting to be too much effort and I don't want the stress of trying to get enough done and have them look good enough. I see it as a whole lot of effort for something that isn't eaten and won't even last once they are near the moisture of the royal icing.

I'm worried about offending her

I wanted to be able to help her with her business but it has shifted the focus from us having a nice dessert to serve our guests

It is making me sick thinking about how we can handle this. I need to talk to my future MIL and get advice from her. The SIL has a bit of a wedge between her and the rest of the family due to her attitude and behaviour so MIL has seen it all and can hopefully help me too.

I've been busy Googling trying to find an alternative to throwing a bouquet at the end of my reception.

Has anybody, what, if anything, did you do instead?

There are a few reasons for me not wanting to throw a bouquet:

-my actual bouquet will be heavy and I worry about it crashing into something or someone.

-the venue is actually too small to effectively throw a bouquet anyway (plus has a low ceiling in the seating area).

-there will be very few single girls there

-it seems to me like a waste of money on a throwaway bouquet.

The best idea I've seen so far is to give it to my Grandma. But if I would make a 'thing' of it

for domestic life. Recipes were given to the bride to help her prepare for entertaining

Honestly Reddit, and it feels like a giant weight was lifted off of my shoulders. Does being relieved make me a bad person?

My advice to anyone getting married is really seriously think about the people you want to be in your wedding. Ask yourself:
1) Is this person a mature adult who can handle just about anything?
2) Is this person responsible?
3) Is this person dependable?
4) Is this person going to be there when I need them?
5) Is this person selfish and self-centered?
6) Is this person going to complain about anything? Or everything?
7) Can this person afford (time and money) to be in a wedding?
8) Does this person have other priorities (an infant, college education, another wedding) that may create a problem?
9) And most importantly

Reddit, and his parents. Seriously, learn from me.

* We had a small wedding (about 35 guests) far away from home on the Friday before Memorial Day. We drove the 900 miles and stayed with friends for a few days before the wedding. No matter what you do, and before you know it, someone will be telling you ""it's time."" I was getting dressed and joking around with the photographer and my bridesmaids when someone suddenly called ""it's time!"" and I was like ""really? already?"" Before I knew it, there was music and my dad was walking me toward the altar.

* We had a short outdoor ceremony in a gazebo. You won't remember a word the minister says, it's your day.

* We had a buffet-style meal with sandwiches, and I remember wanting more. The bridesmaids and groomsmen did us a solid by setting up the bridal dressing room with food and drinks and they made us go in there alone for about 10 minutes. It was really nice to get to sit down with my husband for a quick bite to eat. Make sure you get time with your new spouse.

* We had our cake made by a fellow Redditor and it was absolutely delish! Of course we forgot to bring a serving knife so my groom and I made it work with 2 plastic knives. Things will go wrong. Just smile

* My groom and his best man stayed up until 3 in the morning putting together music for the reception... then we hardly used any of it. Scope out your reception location and if there's not a huge dance floor

* Getting a great photographer is key! We had so much fun with our photographer and we got amazing pictures. She posted some of them last night and more are on the way and I am ecstatic! Find someone who does amazing work, don't give them breaks and generally treat them like crap, how can you honestly expect them to do the best job they can? Treat them right and they'll treat you right. So far, [we love the pictures she got.](http://i.imgur.com/oNPGo.jpg)

* Make arrangements for leftover food. We had a lot of leftovers and, you'll be throwing a lot of money (and delicious food) down the drain.

* It will be hard

So much more happened and I'll answer questions if anyone has them. To be honest I was feeling the stress the day before the wedding and I really started regretting not just going to the courthouse. But then the wedding came... and I wouldn't give that day up for the world. It was amazing being able to see everyone we love

I finally decided order of events, mum wants to manage the whole thing alone and doesn't trust anyone else to do it right, I just want to celebrate with my loved ones and my fiance just wants to get married (duh)..

and so I came up with a split day.

We will have a gorgeous midday ceremony, we will be able to socialize and talk to all of our family and really enjoy the company and it will all die down and be over by 6pm, this gives all our older relatives a chance to get home early, the day doesn't drag on and no one ends up tired and exhausted.

After this, speeches and plenty of food and we can all celebrate for as long and as late as we wish, there is accommodation for plenty and the following day me and my new husband will be able to fly off to our honeymoon.

Feels so good to finally have a foundation

However, almost the whole ceremony, the 1 year old was whining. They were a few rows behind me (I didn't even know who it was until afterwards) and it was very distracting and hard for me to pay attention (as I imagine it was for others). I sat there the whole time and wondered why that person didn't get up and leave to calm the child. I mean, usually that's what people should do. I've always seen it as rude to just sit there with a crying child and disturb everyone (is that just me?). 

When I found out it was my cousin whose child was acting that way, it worries me because this cousin will pretty much HAVE to bring her children because there's no one to keep them (my mother says her husband just ""doesn't do that."" Great husband, huh?)

1306693857.0,hmy0z,I am a wedding/party planner. Here are some useful tips and feel free to AMA.,absinthevisions,25,2,27,"I've planned 45 weddings and 15 parties. I'm currently working on 2 weddings so I know how stressful it can be trying to meet budgets and make everyone including yourself happy on your big day. Here are a few insider tips to help you save money and stress.

1. May

2. Do NOT scimp on the photographer!!! You will regret it for the rest of your life. You do not want to look back in 2 years or 10 or 50 and go WTF was I thinking? What was this guy shooting? The biggest part of your budget should go to first the food and then to the photographer.

3.If you want to save money select a non-wedding venue. You may have to get creative in your serch but places like museums, resturants, upscale private homes, aquariums,zoos, and parks that are not normally ""wedding"" venues will often give you a better price but are often more accomadating and willing to throw in perks. Perks can include: Free parking, tables, china, and coat service.

4. Read EVERYTHING and understand it before you sign a contract or pay for any service. Take your time with it and ask questions if something is unclear or worded in a way that you don't understand. This is one of the biggest mistakes people make in wedding planning yet it seems like the most obvious.

5.Buy items that do not have the word ""wedding"" attatched to it or come from the ""wedding"" section of a store. The mark-up on ""wedding"" items is amazing. You can easily pay 3x as much for the exact same item that you could have walked 2 aisles over and picked up. The difference you ask? One has ""wedding"" labled on it and the other dosen't. Take unity candles for example: a set of 3 white pillar candels with ribbon around them boxed as ""wedding unity candels"" costs $40. Yet in the same store

6. Do it your self as much as possiable. There are many great free tutorials on youtube and on wedding forums for everything like: Flowers, make-up, invatations, aisle runners, cake toppers, place settings,ect.  Just make sure you do multiple trial runs well before the date and you give yourself plenty of time to do it. Plus you have a back up plan.

7. If you are on a budget and want a designer wedding gown, ebay for an actual seller, craigs list, and local classified. BEWARE of the knock-off dresses from China. They are all over ebay and have several websites. They promise designer dresses for around $200-$700. These are cheap un-licenced copies of the dresses and the quility is not even close to a match. Some girls get lucky and get dresses that can be saved by a seamstress but most end up needing a new dress and they are out the money that they spent on the cheap one.

If you aren't into the designer gowns and just want a simple dress or a dress of color

8.Do away with the whole wedding favor for the guests thing. It's a waste of so much money that you could have put to something else. No one cares or remembers or wants anything they've ever been given at a wedding. Most people leave them on the table or throw them away shortly after getting home. Put the money toward good food and booze..your guests will remember that more.

9.If you want to save on the catering bill you may want to opt for a cheaper menu. You could go for an hors d'oeuvres only or a dessert only reception. You can also opt for a cake and punch only reception. These should only be done at non-meal times(2pm-4pm and 8pm to 10pm) and should be printed on your invites.
Some other options are brunch and buffet type receptions. 

Hope some of you find this useful. I'll add stuff as I think of it!

My fiance and I are getting married in less than two months (December 1). Almost everything is in place; dress, venues, caterer, cake, dj, officiant, the whole nine yards. Then yesterday I was taken completely by surprise.

My fiance wants to be a doctor and is working his way towards medical school. It's no secret that medical school is super expensive and most doctors spend decades paying off their student loans. Well,000 with no age cap, just whenever he finishes his degree. And then, if all of the money hasn't been used by the time his degree is finished, we would get the difference. The only catch is that my fiance has to be able to be claimed as a dependent on his dad's tax forms. That means he can't be legally married.

Too much time and money have been invested in the wedding to call it off or postpone it now. So it's been suggested that we follow through with the ceremony and just not sign the papers.

I won't lie. I cried. A lot. Hard.

I feel ridiculous and selfish

But this opportunity is too good for him to pass up. He wouldn't be in debt and we wouldn't spend the rest of our lives trying to balance a home budget with paying back student loans.

I'm so confused and stressed and I can't think straight. Does anyone have any advice they can give to try and work through this? It would be much appreciated...

Remember when I told you guys about the photographer that ended up having to bail on me due to her due date falling basically on my wedding? Well

Let's see... I originally had spoken with her on May 13th

And waited.

Two and a half weeks went by. I contacted her again. A few days later (now over three weeks out) I got a response back from her. ""Give it a few days to see if it'll turn up; if it doesn't

Three days later, but I opted to let it slide. Deposited it on the 24th (first chance I was able to get out to the bank.) And whaddya know, it bounced. So on top of having $550 less in my account than I had anticipated having this month, I have also been hit with fees. Needless to say, I'm livid.

Normally, but I have yet to get a response from her. I feel like she's now purposely avoiding me. I'm willing to give her a couple of days (in the likely event that she is doing weddings this weekend) before I start calling down the fire and brimstone.

I guess what I really want to know is if this is in fact lawyer-worthy, and it was my fault for not depositing it immediately upon receipt, but honestly I'm not feeling like that's the case.

We've been together for about 7.5 years now &amp; I can't imagine being with anyone but him. Right now our plans are to have a small wedding in August 2013 in Las Vegas with our families &amp; a few friends, about an hour from my parents &amp; grandparents. His family is exclusively in CA/AZ.)

I just can't get excited about *planning* my wedding

1. (Most importantly) Our families are from opposite sides of the US. His family lives in (&amp; can't afford to travel far from) California &amp; Arizona, since that would allow the most people to come. But in the 5 months since we agreed on a location, my grandparents' mobility has gone seriously downhill, to the point where they physically cannot travel &amp; I really want them to be there. Even Skyping the ceremony to them wouldn't really solve it, because my grandma is mostly blind &amp; both grandparents are pretty hard of hearing. Has anyone invented the transporter from Star Trek yet? I could really use one about now... 

2. (More selfishly) I don't really have any girl friends to plan/get excited about the wedding with. I'm frustrated because I haven't started making plans because I haven't resolved #1, &amp; while he is great for bouncing ideas off or venting to, he's not a flamboyant or girly guy either, &amp; I don't want to force him into helping with stuff he's not normally interested in. I have maybe 2 good girl friends, but they both live very far away from me &amp; we haven't been as close lately as we used to. How can I get over this? I know I don't *need* other people to plan my wedding, I just want to have fun with it like every other woman seems to!

3. (My problem &amp; I have to solve it, there's nothing in sight. My parents &amp; my fiance are encouraging me to go ahead with planning the wedding but I'm a realistic person &amp; it feels wrong to be planning a wedding while we're struggling to cover our normal bills. My fiance says ""Don't worry, you'll get a job soon!"" but who knows when ""soon"" will be? My parents say ""You need to reserve your date &amp; start finalizing details sooner rather than later, it will get more expensive the longer you wait"" &amp; I know they're correct but that doesn't change everything else. My first instinct is to wait another year to get married (we have an exact date for a reason, so we'd have to wait til August 2014) but then I have to take the chance that my grandparents &amp; some of my English relatives literally may not make it until then.

My maid of Honor is doing her PHD right now so she is basically super busy all the time.

Also right from the get go I told my whole wedding party my MOH situation and they were all more then willing to fill in where she couldn't knowing that I asked my MOH to be MOH because we have been best friends since we were 3! 

I think part of the reason why everything is working out so well is because we are being mindful of everyone's situation.  I have a wide range of body types in my wedding party so when we went shopping I told everyone the color the dress would be (Royal Blue) and said they could pick out whatever dresses they liked.  It took us all of 1 hour at Davids Bridal and they picked out 2 different dresses!  I think the hardest part was them realizing I wanted them to make the final decision on their dresses so everyone was comfortable!

I think the only issue we are running into now is on my end.  I keep getting asked to give the bridesmaids more to do.  But to be honest I really don't have a lot for even myself to do right now.

- While most people don't care, visit our website"" note on the bottom. new note: we did [weddingwire](http://www.weddingwire.com/)) I had many long conversations with people and decided it wouldn't be right to include registry inserts in the formal invitations. Most were invited to the bridal shower anyway which included registry information and others will find our via word-of-mouth or our website.
-  Organize addresses by her family, friends of his family, our friends. It took us a while to search through and make sure everyone was there and included.
-  Have and agree on a ""plus 1"" idea. We are giving our friends a plus one, it's something we can easily explain and justify.
-  ALWAYS buy more invitations than you need. Originally my SO told me to just order 80 (that was our list a half year ago with about 3 extra invites) I decided to spend the extra cash and got a little over 100. Definitely worth it.
- We decided no kids. We had no trouble with this when the wedding day came. ""Please join us for an Adult reception at (time)"" is a good phrase to use for the reception cards if you do the same so no one gets the wrong impression.
-  Right before we started putting on the stamps

*TLDR from original post: I don't like diamonds

I asked my mom her opinion on the matter. As it turns out she has jewelry that has been in my family awhile that she would really like us to use the stones from and have them reset. She has a diamond engagement ring/wedding band, and there are two of them, since they are earrings and all. Conceivably I could use her diamond from the engagement/wedding ring and put the two sapphires on the sides. So the SO and I are going to visit jewelry stores and see about what they can do to have the stones reset for me. Yay! I love this for the following reasons:

1. It will most likely fit our budget
2. It's more sustainable to reuse stones and I can have some diamonds with less ethical problems...if they are blood diamonds
3. I get to have beautiful sapphires AND diamonds that we never could have afforded on our own
4. The SO and I can have fun designing the ring
5. Jewelry stays in the family and mommy is happy!

I'm, but I really appreciate all of the input.

We have the venue, invitations, and all of the major stuff. However, we've been shopping for a photographer for about two months, and we still haven't booked. We have been going back and forth with potential photogs over email, and spent four hours last weekend interviewing two of them them. Now we are in ""contract negotiations"" with the one we want.

Things I didn't anticipate: 

* My fiance started a new job in June, he has been so stressed out from the workweek that all he wants to do is NOT think on Saturday and Sunday. Getting him to help with wedding planning has been difficult. I've done most of the work for him, but there are certain things I CAN NOT do, like try on his suit or the groomsmen's suits.
* The amount of time it takes to coordinate appointments with potential vendors and my fiance's busy work schedule is immense.
* Premarital counseling has taken up a lot of time and energy. It's energy well spent
* Choosing decorations requires several appointments to the rental company.
* Invitations don't just have to be SELECTED, etc., etc.

So I had dinner with my parents last night. I explained that from the beginning, we had no problem going back to what we originally wanted and saving the wedding money for a nest egg for whenever we buy a house. My dad eventually seemed somewhat open to the idea, but my mom.... she has a flair for the dramatic. The word ""humiliating"" was used like 4 different times over the course of the night. She said that if we didn't invite the extended family, she would stop going to the family reunions out of shame. She was laying the emotional manipulation on really thick, but I held my ground. She pouted a lot but listened to everything I had to say.


So here's where they are with money. When my sister got married a year ago, though, the company hasn't been doing as well, and the bonuses have been fewer and smaller. Dad said not to worry about it though, because he was planning on borrowing against his 401k to make up for it. I'm really not crazy about this idea, I hate that my parents would go into debt (sorta) just to pay for this wedding. Also, several months ago my mom sold $3000 worth of tools to a friend of hers, but she still hasn't come through with it. My mom was planning on using that money for deposits from the beginning


The thing is..... I don't know if I even want it anymore. The idea of running off one weekend and eloping is sounding better and better. I honestly think my dad would be secretly relieved. My mom wouldn't be happy, and I really feel like it fits me and my fiancé better than some big expensive party.

**[Pictures of the wine at our wedding reception](http://imgur.com/a/7ozSb)**

**Story:**

For quite some time, we decided to make another two batches as favors for our wedding guests. Let me know what you think and if you have any questions!


---
**Equipment Kit:**

Between our homebrew store, eBay seemed to have the best prices out of the three for all of the equipment/kits we needed so we bought everything from there. 

The **[kit we bought from eBay](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=2&amp;pub=5575034733&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5337214727&amp;customid=&amp;icep_item=350148648921&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg)** was about $110 after shipping.  The merchant, we've purchased many more products from them so I can say that they are a reliable company.

The equipment was for a 6 gallon batch.  To make this many bottles at one time



**Juice Kits:**

I bought two juice kits for this as we were making two batches and was in a hurry.  If you have the time

* 1) **[Vintner's Reserve - Sauvignon Blanc](http://bit.ly/1668BGD)** (Everyone at the homebrew store told me that this would be the wine that would be ready the soonest)


* 2) **[Vino Italiano - Barolo](http://bit.ly/1668x9M)** (Had good reviews online)


**Bottles, Labels**


Bottles: 
We bought my bottles from my local homebrew store as those were the cheapest (and I wouldn't have to pay shipping for them).  However

Each kit makes about 30 750ml Bottles or 120 187 ml Bottles.  The 187 bottles made for good favors as they were tiny and could fit in a purse.  We went ahead with 187 ml bottles and BOY was that a hit!

Corks:

The corks that fit these bottles are the #7 corks. These were super expensive at the local brewing store so I purchased them **[off of eBay](http://bit.ly/17Hhv8Q)**.  

PVC Caps:

I bought white and gold PVC caps for my wine **[through eBay](http://bit.ly/16698Z9)**.  PVC caps make for a professional finish to your product. They're very easy to use to seal your bottles with and they are very easy to remove when you want to drink it.  We were thinking about wax dipping all of our bottles but that is always very difficult to remove before drinking.  **[Here is a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RMO7xLXC6o)** that shows you the process of putting PVC caps on your bottles

Labels:

You can buy **[Avery Wine Labels](http://www.avery.com/avery/en_us/Products/Marketing-Solutions/Labels/Textured-Arched-Labels-Laser-3in-x-2_.25in-White-Print_To_The_Edge-9up-10shts_22809.htm)** from Staples

---

**WINE MAKING PROCESS:**

**1) Days 1-10: Primary fermentation.**

The kits came with everything I needed to sanitize and set up Primary fermentation.  The whole process took about 30 minutes on Day 1.  I made two 5.5-gallon batches using the kit's juice, and filtered tap water (not distilled) -  then I set it aside for about 9-10 days.

Note: This may smell up your apartment/basement/wherever you keep your wine. The smell will go away

* **Total Time it took: 30 Minutes**

**2) Days 11-21: Secondary Fermentation.**

All I did was check the specific gravity using the hydrometer and syphon the wine from the buckets to two sanitized glass carboys.  The whole process took about 15 minutes. I then let this sit for another 10 days. 

* **Total Time it took: 15 Minutes**

**3) Days 21 - 35: Stabilizing and Clearing**

On Day 21

I then topped up the carboys to about 5.5 gallons and added sterilized glass marbles to the carboys to displace the liquid so that there would be very little air at the top.  I didn't want to add too much water for fear that it would dilute my wine

* **Total Time it took: 1 Hour**


**4) Day 35 - Tasting and Bottling**

I poured some of the solution into a testing tube and checked the specific gravity/tasted it.  The gravity was solid and it tasted pretty good. I read that the longer you age it

I cleaned and sanitized 225 bottles and lined them up to syphon wine into.  I used the bottling attachment of the syphon (came with the kit) to fill each bottle

After corking

* **Total time it took: 5.5 hours to do 225 bottles.**  

- 1 Hour to sanitize everything
- 3 Hours to bottle the wine
- 1 Hour to cork all of the bottles (~4/minute)
- 30 minutes to cap all of the bottles


**5) Labeling**

- After designing the labels (the initials of my wife and I)

* **Total Time It Took: 1 hour**

---
Final Notes: 

* If you have a local homebrew store

* SANITIZE EVERYTHING immediately before use and CLEAN EVERYTHING immediately after use.  Doing so will help to make sure your finished product tastes great

---
**TL;DR**: My wife and I recently got married and made 225 bottles of wine to give to our friends and family for our wedding and as gifts.  The whole process took a little over a month (not including aging the wine).

**Verdict after 1 month of aging**: Tastes pretty good! Very drinkable!  The white wine is super crisp and lovely. The red is a little strong but has a deep/rich flavor.

**Verdict after 2 months of aging**: Thrilled that the flavor got much better!  Note: It doesn't taste like a fancy bottle of wine - but it does taste very similar to a $15 bottle of wine!

**Verdict after 6 months of aging**: The flavors have settled and are very full and bold.

We're going to age a few of them for a total of 12 months and will report back after we try them.

We hope that this post helps other people start their adventures in making wine/beer at home.  We are now moving forward on another batch using fresh grapes!  Wish us luck!

UPDATE: Thanks so much everyone for your input.  I will try to post updated photos at some point but I'm at work and dont have time to get them up. 

So far this is the feedback I have taken and what I have changed:

Main Invite:  I have done away with Papyrus and switched it all to noteworthy font. The name font I am keeping the same but will work on making the J look less like a T. 

RSVP Card:  All font is now Noteworthy. Cursive font is out.  I have added a line for names. 

Activity schedule: I also did away with the cursive font and changed all of the schedule to the same font, sat, sun) are the same bc those are images I dropped in so I cant change the font- I guess I could create my own with whatever font I like but I'm not sure how to get that washed out worn effect that is in the background of the words and I really liked that.

1372727178.0,1hgs5u,I went dress shopping for the first time today. What a weird experience...,Dhraciana,19,2,43,"I made an appointment and went to the local David's Bridal to try on dresses. I wanted to get an idea of what I liked in a dress. I'm not anti-DB

I went by myself for a number of reasons. One, I trust my own judgement about fashion and what looks good on me. If I'm not comfortable in it, I'm not going to put myself out there on my wedding day. Three, this was just a visit to try different style, cuts, etc. 

Well

However, I still felt like a kid playing dress up. I wasn't (consciously) expecting a revelation and sudden feeling of 'bridal-ness', but I just felt weird. Like I was pretending. I've seen hundreds (thousands) of pictures of models and real brides in dresses, but there was a complete disconnect between seeing myself in one and thinking...Bride. 

I sent my fiance a couple of pictures to surprise him (he didn't know I was going today), or the wedding really being real, or anything like that. I was absolutely looking for some sort of validation and didn't get it. Maybe if I had some friends with me, that would have made the experience more 'real'. I'm tempted to send my mom the pictures or send them to a friend and see what reaction I get.

Pictures here -- http://marybethbueno.com/a-love-story/
Video collage of pics here -- http://marybethbueno.com/joie-de-vivre-joy-of-life-2/

General Info -- we had a 5 month engagement.  Our families and many friends live out of state.  This is a second marriage for me (widowed) and a first for him.  We lived together nearly 2 years before the wedding.  Our colors were neutrals &amp; purples (any shade of purple,000 on the wedding, with my parents contributing $5,000 (very unexpected and appreciated).  We didn't keep extremely close tabs on that because we had expected to spend that much ourselves without my parents' help, so we weren't super strict on sticking to that number.

Invitations -- used a Groupon from Picaboo.  Ordered about 75 invites I think.  COST -- $40 (plus postage)

Ceremony Venue -- we got married in a park that is about 5 minutes from our house.  We chose it because we don't belong to a church and we've spent a lot of time running and biking the trails of this park

Officiant -- had a friend do this.  We paid for his hotel room (he lives 1.5 hrs away), another did a secular reading).  Cost -- $250 for 2 nights' hotel

Programs -- Wilton fan kits (it was Texas

Ceremony details -- we had a cooler full of ice cold bottled water that the ushers handed out.  We had a basket of kiddie stuff -- wedding themed color and craft books

Wedding Party -- we had 4 attendants each and no kids in ceremony.  Our siblings were all part of the party, and this was especially important because of it being a home reception (more details on that below).  For wedding party attire -- I picked the color of dress from David's Bridal and told the girls I wanted knee-length.  They had over 12 options to choose from, and all chose different styles.  They had freedom to choose their own shoes &amp; accessories.  They paid for their own dresses.  Groom took as many guys as he could get together shopping and they picked out khakis from Gap and white shirts from another store (they went to an outlet mall).  They were told to wear brown shoes &amp; belt.  For the House Party girls, I asked them to wear purple.  

Dress -- I admit, and my purse was also a Craigslist find.  My bracelet was $15 on sale, and my friend's mom (who makes jewelry) made my necklace (stunning!).

Getting ready -- I paid for all the bridesmaids to have their hair done, a splurge because we could.  :)

Music -- we had a friend of a friend run sound at the ceremony (iPad)and serve as DJ at reception.  He did this for free

Reception -- our house &amp; backyard.  My advice for anyone who is doing this is:  make use of all the space you can!  We moved our living room furniture into the garage so the living room was where we set up the buffet table, regular &amp; decaf coffee, cookies, etc.  We wanted a place the older folks could sit down and where people could relax in the a/c.  We also had a card table in the kitchen/dining area for the same reason.

We rented a dance floor ($700), honestly -- we have about 0.32 acres total) was divided basically into 3 sections -- you'd walk out the back door and on the porch was the photo booth.  Behind that were the tables and chairs (to sit &amp; eat).  In the middle was the dance floor.  To the left was the bar, cocktail tables, and port-a-potty (our bathrooms inside were available too, but this helped).

Decorations -- We made our own centerpieces (well, and for centerpieces, we'd take 3 bottles of different sizes and colors, and glue them together (with a pretty ribbon around them).  They were the vases for our flowers.  For the jars - we took tissue paper and mod-podged them and put in LED or tealights for lanterns, to set around the yard where needed.  (We also rented 6 purple uplights.)  We also had a ton of white lights -- we strung some strands from our porch to a tree above the dining area, and wrapped trees in Christmas lights (all white), plus had the bushes draped in white lights.  Very romantic and nice.  I have to say -- my hubby did a great job getting the yard in tip-top shape and hanging lights!  (We had a bbq one weekend and provided the food and beer and had some of the wedding guys hang up the lights).

Rental Costs for reception -- about $2200 -- biggest items were dance floor and photo booth.  We also rented 1 sterno, 25 chairs, chafing dish, a Port-a-cool fan to put next to the dance floor, port-a-potty ($125), bar, 5 cocktail tables

Food -- we spent about $700, 6 or so veggie burgers for those who don't do meat, pasta salad, fruit salad, potato chips &amp; onion dip (my aunt &amp; uncle brought it from Iowa -- you can't get my favorite dip in TX!), cheese &amp; crackers, and cookies/candy/cake.

Alcohol -- we paid a bartender $200, about 6 bottles each), gin lemonades, and we had a whiskey bar -- the bartender was making Old Fashioneds and Manhattans, and had other mixers for whiskey.  We had about 6-8 whiskeys to choose from.  Oh, and complementary cigars.  This was really cool.  People loved our drinks!  And the groom was telling guys to meet at the ""cigar lounge"" (our patio furniture in one corner of the yard) at 11 pm to share a cigar.  It was cool seeing all the guys do that.  We put up a tent (like the pop-up tailgating kind) over the bar area, with white lights around it.  We put the bar in front of our shed, too.  I honestly don't know what we spent on liquor -- that was hubby's jurisdiction.  Lol.  But it wasn't too bad....less than $1

Cake -- I got a heck of a deal!  We had a basic white, and did NOT tell them it was a wedding cake (the cheapest wedding cake they do, which was SMALLER, was $400).  It all got eaten (we didn't save the top layer), but everyone who wanted some got some.  We also had cookies galore, and candy.

Flowers -- I got them from Trader Joe's.  Picked them up the day before the wedding.  Just got assorted seasonal flowers in the right colors, and vases I could find, and then some!  We put bunches of eucalyptus (wrapped and hung with ribbon) in the bathrooms and port-a-potty, which made them smell really good.  TOTAL -- $187

Photographer -- FREE.  Found someone on Craigslist who is looking to go pro and wanted to shoot a wedding.  We ended up giving her $100 and also made a donation to the Wounded Warriors Project (she is from a military family).  And we'll buy a set of proofs

Shuttle -- we had a shuttle that would take guests from the hotel to the wedding, but it was full and helped a lot to alleviate parking issues in our residential neighborhood.  And the last shuttle of drunkards had the driver take them to a bar instead of the hotel, lol!  It was fun seeing our friends and families from different times and places of our lives come together like that.

Favors -- we weren't going to do these, and the photo booth pics, people didn't leave empty handed.  I also forgot to tell people to take centerpieces and decorations, but am giving those out now.

Hmmmm....what else?

We also had baskets in each bathroom with things like ibuprofen, hairspray, Immodium, lint rollers, sewing kits, first aid kits, etc.  Got a lot of that stuff from dollar stores.

We did a lot of borrowing

PROS of home wedding -- you can plan things just how you want them

CONS of home wedding -- you get obsessive thinking about possibilities

All in all -- we wouldn't have changed a thing!  It was awesome!  And I'd be happy to answer any questions any of you have about any of the details

EDIT -- I should add that we did as much decorating and re-arranging as we could before our families started to arrive, getting all electrical stuff sorted out (lights, DJ equipment), putting the tent up over the bar, etc.  It was actually really fun working together and having everyone spend the day together.

EDIT -- we also rented a generator.  Kind of noisy but well worth it!  We put it in the front yard where no one was hanging out.

EDIT -- a couple more details I forgot....

Guest book -- we did a fingerprint tree.  My mom made it.  She is so talented

1373402180.0,1hyj72,[UPDATE] Our Intimate backyard wedding is getting too big.,Heymarisela,19,2,4,"The original post is here 
http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1hsz2g/our_intimate_backyard_wedding_is_getting_too_big/

I came to the conclusion that I wanted to invite my teams SO because I wanted them to be with the person they love (if they have one) while they witness us publicly state that we want to be in love forever. Those invites plus some my mom added put us at around 125 and probably more than should be invited to my parents NOT super big house for my wedding. 

We discussed our guest list issue with my parents and we all hashed it out at great length. There was a day where we were set on the backyard wedding with just cutting my whole team from the guest list but after awhile that made me sad so a couple hours later I'm getting quotes on wedding venues to see what we could get that was bare bones yet still beautiful for 150 guest for not more than 2500 than our budget. Then it went back to my parents saying they want to do it at the house and we can just make it work. Got a call back from them about 20 minutes later wanting to the addresses of the possible venues. We were at a standstill because my fiance and I didn't want to invite less people but we also didn't want to rent a venue when our hearts and budget weren't in it. 

We had a long talk last night and decided FOR SURE (as in I'm not looking at venues anymore) that it will be at my parents house. We are ending up inviting a couple MORE people not less and changing the feel from intimate backyard wedding to loving party where people happen to get married. We will set up a chalkboard we have from our home brew tasting party letting people know to grab a drink and that the short ceremony will be at 5:30 and food will be buffet style starting at 6. We will NOT have enough tables to seat everyone at once and will instead have areas set up to encourage folks to drink for a while then get food, have less formal feel, be relaxed in the space we are on in, and focus on each other and spending time with our friends and family than doing it at a rental hall. Parking, seating, and restrooms are going to be a challenge but I have no doubt we will be able to provide enough of all three that it's not a problem so long as our guests don't have an issue with our wedding not being a ""proper formal wedding"" 

Our current solution isn't really a problem solver for hitting numbers because typically you can't just say ""screw it"" and invite more people and hope everyone gets along swimmingly and everyone fits but in the end that's what we have decided to do for us. I'll make sure to update again if we hit any other problems when planning out setup and final outcome. Hopefully everything comes up roses and we don't end up like in Father of the Bride and have to park all our guests cars on our lawn.

My fiance and I got engaged back in July last year. We decided pretty much immediately that we wanted a childless reception with only two exceptions- his brother and sister who are 12 and 4. His brother is going to be a groomsman and his sister will be our flower girl. We were initially worried about some push back from his family

My fiance's aunt was my co-worker/friend and she is actually the one who got us together. I want her to be in the wedding, ""we'll talk about that later."" I was completely taken aback by her response as I thought it was a little rude, but I let it go because I was newly engaged and wasn't ready to put my foot down about anything. We were also at a family party and I wasn't about to cause any drama. My fiance and I continued to tell people that we weren't inviting children expect for our two very special exceptions.

Skip ahead a couple of months and this aunt decides to spring on us that not only is she bringing her kids to the hotel we're getting married at (it's out-of-state)

Skip ahead now to about three weeks ago. My fiance, is totally pissed, and is whining about having to tell her kids they can't come. 

She intentionally sparked drama a couple weeks ago

I am fed up and I don't know what to do. I want to talk to her, especially since she knew this was our original decision (though she chose to ignore it). Is she being as ridiculous as I think she is, or were my fiance and I wrong for telling her that her kids cannot attend the ceremony?

I'm really stressing about this and just need some outside input. We're just trying to be fair across the board. She is the only person in either family who has a problem with our adults only wedding. And as I said before

Thanks for reading this wall of text!

TL;DR- Bridesmaid was told initially that wedding is adults only (except my fiance's little brother and sister who are in the wedding party), she flipped out and now won't talk to me. She has caused drama and deliberately avoided us since the confrontation. Do I apologize or tell her she's out of the wedding?",,False,self,t5_2rv3t,False,6months,

**Background:**

My fiancé and I have been together for 5 years

So, it’s just that the guys have always been the “lynch pin” of the group. This has not caused any issue at all.) Keep in mind that the men ask each other to be groomsmen *after* we both set dates, and John and Jane know that my fiancé and I will be married by the time of their wedding.

**Where I can’t tell if I’m being unreasonable:**

John and Jane start planning their wedding weekend. They aren’t going away for their honeymoon for a while, so it’s about $150/person.

I’m not invited. To any of this, especially if they are married.

The other thing is

Additionally

I’ve talked to my fiancé about it, *especially* John… and that weekend really is probably one of the only times he’ll see them for a while, especially in that capacity. John and Jane are moving far out of the country a couple months after they get married, so it really will be the last time he sees them for a while. I couldn’t take that away from him. So we’ve paid the $150 for the cabin and he’s doing it.

At the same time though, maybe I’m being completely unreasonable in my expectations.

1359935562.0,17u1rj,I find it difficult to find shoes in my (large!) size in mainstream stores. So I designed my wedding shoes and had them handmade for me.,Story_Time,22,6,6,"So I'm generally European 42 (a size 10.5-11 here in New Zealand) AND my feet are pretty wide across the ball of my foot. I can occasionally fit into a generous 41

My partner and I got Officially Engaged in March of 2012

Our wedding colours are blue, and while I can find HEAPS of silver shoes (which is great for my bridesmaids), finding myself a pair of gold ones was *very* difficult. Finding a pair of gold heels that FIT was even harder.

I really didn't want to go with a basic cream or ivory shoes that screamed bridal. I didn't want a stilletto, I didn't want crystal details. What I wanted a pair of crazy out-there shoes that would continue to be eye catching even when I wore them in the next few years. I even searched for drag queen shoes in my city but couldn't find them.

I had some misgivings about buying shoes off the internet, or they'd be cheap and nasty or **something would just go horribly wrong**.

Then I remembered a website a friend had told me about years ago, and **free returns**. You basically get on there, ***design your own shoe*** and then they make it up and ship it out to you.

It's pricey but at my size

Anyway

I told them what size shoe I wore and there was a space for notes about my feet so I could tell them how wide my foot is. I ordered a 42.5 Wide to take into account the extra width. Then, not the 42.5. 

Then, only 17 days after ordering, 12 days after confirming my size, I got home to find an email with a photo of my shoes, their construction having been completed. They told me they had been shipped and I could expect them ""early next week."" Well, Monday morning comes around and they're delivered to work, less than 3 weeks after ordering! 

Anyway

I'm from a capital city in Australia, a basic 3-course, house wine and beer package is $100/person - and that pricing is consistent no matter where we go, even if we hire a hall with external caterers and our own alcohol (we've investigated all of these options!). He keeps referencing his wedding, which was 40+ years ago

If he had a problem with the type of reception - e.g. He thought we should have a cocktail reception instead to save money - I would be more understanding. The problem is that he literally has no idea how much a function costs - wedding or not - and refuses to change his perceptions no matter what. Him and my FMIL recently attended a niece's wedding and afterward he told me that their reception ""only cosy $4000 and it was really nice, he still didn't get it! There is really no option to get our guest list that low, we are looking at 65+ people for just family. My FMIL agrees with us that he has unreasonable expectations, but he won't listen to her either. 

I have spoken to my fiancé about this, not me, so I shouldn't worry about it. I really don't feel that this is true, and I find it really hurtful that he would think either of us would be overly extravagant or irresponsible with money - we recently bought a house, despite both being full-time students, and are on track to pay off the mortgage in 5 years. 

The obvious solution is to sit down with him and talk about it, and won't withhold it if he thinks we are being extravagant, so that's not the issue - I just really don't want him to think that me and/or my fiancé are irresponsible with money. I get the feeling that he would make little comments throughout the planning process and on the day itself, which would majorly stress me out.

 I did mention once, ""so there are no hire fees and you can bring your own food and alcohol"". He hadn't considered how we would get a power connection to the caterers, who would serve the food/drinks, where the tables/chairs/crockery/glasses would come from, who would set it up, etc. - just mentioned the park and then said that it was easy to find somewhere if we looked hard enough, and started talking about something else so I couldn't interject and tell him all of this. 

I'm truly at my wits end with this - it is important to me that he doesn't see us as overly extravagant or bad with money

TLDR: Future father-in-law has no concept of how much weddings cost, but this is really bothering me.

She still won't talk to me. I sent her a text message (because I know she there is no other way to get in touch with her at this point) reminding her that I asked her to be a bridesmaid (she claims my fiance asked her

**Backstory:** My fiance has an older step brother, and my fiance and I have know each other for 10+ years. Phil moved out west for work, leaving his longtime (2.5 years) girlfriend back home. While out west, he got another girl pregnant and immediately married her (we'll call her Megan), not really giving his girlfriend or family back home any explanation, just a phone call that said ""I got Megan pregnant and now we're married"". No one has really met her or knows her because they never visit because now they have two children and my fiance's family can hardly find time to make the trip out to visit. As of now, they're looking to move back because his work might be transferring him. 

**Now, we would chat via text, FB message and comment on each other's statuses on FB, general things that friends do. But some of the things she says and views she has on things are a little strange, like when she married Phil, she called up his ex who was trying to get in touch with him and cussed her out saying how she was nuts and needs to let him go and to stop trying to contact him because he obviously doesn't want to be with her. Anyway, once we started planning our wedding, out on a date and even to the movies. I know some kids can sit still and be quiet, our reception venue is located in a historic building in the wine cellar, if she wanted me to. All I got back from her was ""okay."" Just the one word from my whole email. I was concerned because I sent her a few more messages and never heard back

I heard through my mother who went to lunch with my future MIL and she told my mother that Megan is livid that I don't want children at the wedding

She has also made rude remarks about me and my fiance and how we're planning our wedding to other family members and right now with them moving back closer to us, step-dad and step-mom) are offering to chip in for the wedding and making a huge deal out of it, and she didn't get any of that with her wedding. It would make sense, but this all started before family members started offering to pay for some of the big ticket items.

1373078028.0,1hq851,"I am in a bind /r/WeddingPlanning. Huge rift recently between my fiancee and her mother, not sure how to proceed.",Blanketsburg,17,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1hq851/i_am_in_a_bind_rweddingplanning_huge_rift/, and we'll be getting married June 21


We live in Boston, due to weather. My fiancee's parents are divorced; that's completely fine -- we get along with her dad and ""stepmom"" (long-time girlfriend, and they now live together, so it's a simpler term), but the relationship with her mother has been touchy. She has been married and divorced twice now (and she's 45 now), and we weren't the most enthused at her second marriage since they got engaged after a few months and thought she was rushing it a bit. At that time, she complained and took that to mean we ""didn't want her to be happy""; not the case. 15 months later (Fall of 2012), and my fiancee's younger brother (now 19) had recently moved to Texas for the military


Fast-forward to a few weeks before we are able to tell her *our* good news, my fiancee initially hides her ring, we all catch up a bit (we weren't able to visit around Christmas), and then my fiancee puts her ring on and we tell her the news. In the span of about two minutes, her mother went from ""Congratulations! I thought something was up!"" to ""Oh, I found I have breast cancer."" quite nonchalantly. All of breakfast was discussing her diagnosis and treatment, and no mention of her happiness of us being engaged. *Please don't take this to mean we are unconcerned about her mother's diagnosis; we certainly are. We were simply hoping for a more happy gathering.*


Skip ahead to February, our families wanted to take a look as well. My family is very close-knit, so they wanted to be involved. Her dad and stepmom wanted to join in whenever they could, and her mom wanted to keep updated. We scheduled a return visit to our first-choice venue, we first invited her dad and stepmom, but they were going to be out of state that weekend. So she asked her mom, and my mom planned on joining as well. Anyone from New England can tell you that the Winter sucked, her dad and stepmom could go, but when she asked when we were going again and we told her


**This is where everything gets out of hand.** This was not in person, blasting her about topics ranging from money, ""not wanting her to be involved"", my fiancee being ""spoiled"" and ""selfish"", us ""not caring about her in her time of need"", etc.My fiancee's mother has always been touchy with money, having withheld child support money from my fiancee when we moved out and she sold my fiancee's old bed, we had not brought up paying for the wedding at all, she proclaimed that even my fiancee's grandmother has ""always thought she was a selfish person who only cares about people when they give them things."" This was the most outlandish of statements


There was no contact for about three weeks, but her mother refused to apologize, and instead insulted her again for being selfish by ""making this about her"", despite it being out the wedding. Things came to a grinding halt when the Marathon Bombings happened in Boston. Her mother knew we had went to Fenway for the Sox game that day, and we were at Kenmore Square about a mile away from everything. At the time, with the lack of information and all the news reports claiming bombs, we were trying to get ahold of friends, that is. Both my fiancee's brother and grandmother told her she should call her mother


Until today, with him acting as somewhat of a mediator. I chose not to attend this session because I didn't want it to seem like we were bullying against her. My fiancee drove 90-minute drive across the state to meet with her mother, and unfortunately I got a call after everything saying that nothing had changed. Her mother still thinks we need to be ""more supportive of her"", that she's standing by all of her insults ""telling it like it is"", and that she doesn't need anyone to tell her what to do. I'm not sure how we can be any more supportive, since after the initial diagnosis, we had talked about her upcoming appointments, etc. She deleted us from Facebook (childish, etc. She referred to herself as a ""survivor"" once or twice during the in-person conversation. It's gotten out of control


My parents have offered to help with the wedding, and will be going full-time after the wedding. We pay our rent, bills, and student loans, and my fiancee's mother is the only one who thinks we have issues with money. During the conversation earlier today, she used an example during this past Christmas of me asking her to split the cost of a laptop for my fiancee before her classes started as a reason of us ""always"" asking her for money. We didn't get that gift, and she got her something else. Cancer is terrible, my fiancee's dad

I've been on pinterest for ever

My biggest gripe is that I make no money. Like i'm saying I scrape by every single month.. My boyfriend and I live together and while he makes a comfortable living, no family here, and a third shift job which makes it really hard for me to work around my schedule. So when people (like my mom, or my future mother in law, or my grandparents) start asking me, well what food are you going to have, where are you going to have it, and in my mind i'm just thinking

I really don't know how to go about the whole... budgeting aspect of a wedding. My fiance's parents make a comfortable living. My family does not. They live about three states away and my mom might as well be living in a condemned building and ""owns her own business"" which means they live off of her boyfriends pizza guy job and she lies on her taxes every year to survive. My dad hasn't had a job in almost 6 years

I would love a simple and small wedding, while his is closer to 120 people. And seeing as a lot of his family would be coming in from out of state, and ALL of my family would be coming from out of state, that would make the rehearsal dinner a must, Right? I haven't been to many weddings, but it seems like you have to treat all of the ""out of towners"" to a fancy meal the day before :l

I'm rambling now out of stress

**TL:DR** Not sure how to have those ""who is paying for what"" conversations and how to start budgeting for a wedding while i'm broke.

*edit* Man, brothers sisters cousin's wife stuff. 

And my fiance and i DO share bills and what not. but, but no one has offered anything to help yet. I just wanted to know the best way to go about figuring that out. Like do I just send out a a card like, ""Do you want to help pay for my wedding, check yes, or no.""?

3. The cups that you have sewn into your dress because being bra-less is awesome don't offer much support. I'm a 'D' cup but I had to buy those little 'cutlet' things so that I filled the dress out properly. I don't have saggy boobs

4. Because I wanted to wear flats

1368067430.0,1dz6ue,RSVP woes- family friend trying to invite people to our wedding...,iamjill,17,0,28,"OMG I never meant this to be so long. You have been warned- this is REALLY long. Sorry! TLDR at the bottom..

So I see RSVP woes on here all the time

My mom and dad met a couple about 3 years ago and became pretty close friends. They are now at every holiday, have them watch their dogs etc. The husband is just kind of lazy and has a bit of a creep factor. As a couple they are uncomfortably disrespectful of each other. They'll call each other names, make fun of each others weight, yell at each other about things they did or didn't do, and all of this in front of my entire family. Their only daughter is 18 (maybe 19) and is spoiled. They just bought her a brand new car, a brand new quad,paid for all of her college... You know the situation- has never wanted for anything in their entire life. Not necessarily a bad thing

We are trying pretty hard to keep our guest list down- as are most of us. Our contract allows 95 people, expecting at least 10 others won't be able to make it. Taking a bit of a risk but I'm pretty confident that it'll be under 100 when it's all said and done- it's a Thursday evening wedding. Buuuuut- we haven't gotten any declines yet so we will see..

Anyways, and that we really don't have room for anyone. She texts again saying ""Really? Even if she pays for it?"" Not wanting to explain our entire contract to her over text, and it being too late to call, and stupid me- not thinking it's a huge deal, I just repeated sorry no- we are trying to keep our number under wraps, and there is a 'b list' of people we are inviting if we get excessive declines. I heard from my sisters that my mom thought it was rude of her to try and invite someone, but at the same time she got upset at me for not just letting him come... There's never really been a way to please her... Any who- I thought that was that. 

A week later I get that families RSVP back. The way I have the RSVP set up is I have the line ""We have __ number of seats reserved in your honor"" written at the top, dad &amp; daughter). They took the liberty of writing 4 people will be attending and ""So and so family +guest."" So even after my mom told them we didn't have room they still had the gall to invite a random stranger to our wedding. And even when it states explicitly that there are only 3 seats allotted to them- twice!!

Our 'policy' on +1's I thought was pretty understandable. Serious relationships- a plus if we've met them, or in the bridal party. This is a family unit- they know plenty of other people there. I have never heard that this daughter is dating anyone. We had to tell many people to stop inviting extended family and friends to the wedding as news was spreading like wildflower and distant relatives I've never met or heard of came out of the woodworks planning to use our wedding as an excuse to go on a vacation. I'm not making that up- that's what my grandmother actually said to me. She was quite upset when I told her we only wanted people we know to be there, and I had to make many phone calls telling everyone to stop telling people about our wedding- we wanted an intimate event. And once we let one person bring someone- we don't really have a leg to stand on anymore if someone else tries to pull the same thing- right?

This was 4 days ago and I still get very upset at this- just the fact that we already said no and she's still trying to weasel around things and get her way. We haven't contacted the couple yet- we will be seeing the couple on Sunday so hoping to come up with how to handle this situation by then. 

I feel like I have to either be a bridezilla and tell her no- and then I would become one of those people she bitches about

So I have come to you guys! What do you guys think I should do? Allow the daughter to bring a date (and hate and resent him from afar?) or upset the crazy family friend and risk being called bridezilla for the rest of my days

So today my FMIL emailed me asking for a copy of our wedding budget and said that we can review it together next time we see each other.  Don't get me wrong I really appreciate everything my FMIL has done for us so far but I feel like this is an bit to far. 

 Yes she is helping financially but shes not paying for the whole thing.  And at one point she said she thought the wedding should be under $10 000 which is not the case since we are inviting 145 people and I wanted a few nice things at the wedding.  

I consider my self very money conscious and it bothers me that she feels we need to review it with her.  I know she will tell us we need to cut things but its a little late for that the weddings in 2 months!  Besides I know we can afford what we are getting and if we cut out things we won't be having the wedding we want. She has already taken it upon herself to do things for us that we didn't as for or want but we looked past it. But this is really starting to get to me.

Edit: Yes I meant overreacting not overeating my apologiesEdit 2: thanks everyone for your help! I talked with my fiance and we talked to his parents.

* Our ""here"" wedding is slated for April 2014

* Cost in many ways may be cheaper. Food is $70 vs $120 for here

*  We'd have no wedding coordinator to handle things for us ""over there"" like we would if we picked somewhere tropical. We'd be planning 95% of everything right from here.

We'd fly out in late January to book a place and hopefully schedule a photographer. To me, but we'd also lose out significantly on gifts that would either offset some of the wedding cost or prevent us from buying all the miscellaneous items people normally get.

My college room mate and I lived together all four years. We had an odd relationship in a way, we weren't huggers, we didn't squeal with excitement when we saw each other after an hour, we rarely talked during summers or other breaks. We lived well together for the most part and were similarly interested in our study/alone time and in having someone to eat wings and watch House with occasionally. 

Well, see each other only rarely when we have parties or for special events or really make an effort to plan an evening with them. Long story short we still enjoy their company but we have grown apart. There were a few tiffs over the years on the guys side about money and things but my roommate and I were pretty much the same, casually friendly to indifferent depending on the day. 

When they got engaged they asked us to help as they are not exactly planning type people. We have both worked in catering and have helped with others weddings before and we enjoy hosting/planning/decorating etc. I spent many a night on the phone with her while she cried because her fiance didn't understand how much something was supposed to cost or whatever. Great, arrange, organize, drive around, etc. We enjoyed it for the most part and we were glad to help friends. 
Despite all of this
In the long run, yada yada. 

Fast forward to this year and we are now planning our wedding. I knew in advance that they would not be willing/able to help us in the way that we helped them and that's not the point

I recently sent an email to her going over the basics of the wedding and talking about plans for engagement party/bridal shower things etc. The wedding is not until this coming spring so we have plenty of time to plan and we have already gotten the basics pinned down. 

The response that I got from her was shockingly rude to me. She basically told me that I shouldn't bother with any wedding ""stuff"" because after her wedding she doesn't understand why anyone cares about it and it was a total waste of money and time and they should have just eloped. Of course she is phrasing it like advice as in ""don't stress about it because it doesn't matter"" but can she not see how shitty that makes me feel to have put as much effort into something for someone else only to have them tell me that it wasn't worth it? It basically seems to me like, I'm over it now so you should just skip everything because it bores me and I don't want to have to do it again."" Even if she isn't going to be helpful in the actual planning, she could at least manage a little enthusiasm for it. 

She proceeds to tell me that she ""isnt sure how many things her husband can attend"" because of his work schedule (did I mention we took a WEEK off for their wedding?) and that they MAY be able to attend the engagement party. 

Also she doesn't like any of the dresses I suggested and doesn't want to spend money on something she'll never wear again ($120 dress I bought for her wedding is still hanging in my closet, do I say something? Let it go and hope it gets better? Ask her if maybe ""planning another wedding so soon after yours is just too much and she wants to bow out?"" I don't know.

Problem was

I found Beholden Bridal on Etsy: http://www.etsy.com/shop/BeholdenBridal   She has a range of styles and price points. I went with the ""Downton Abbey"" slipper, and they just had the right amount of sparkle and oomph to make me feel like I was wearing a very special, expensive pair of shoes.

And she was super sweet and easy to deal with. My MOH ordered them for me

OOh

Check her out! She made me a very happy bride!
