**Please note that this is how I do things**

----------------------

**1) Pick A Game You Love** 

You need to pick a game you absolutely love to play and genuinely will not mind starting over and over and over again

**2) Do Your Research** 

Find the WR run of the game you choose, statistics for various things (heavily dependent on the game) and set some time aside during the week to study these. This will probably be the most annoying thing to do out of everything because you need to take notes, mentally or on paper/computer, so you can understand mechanically how things function within the game and WHY these tricks work. 

**3)  Getting Your Baseline** 

Do a casual run, just delete the split from your timings so that your splits and the WR splits are the same reference points. This is very adjustable and heavily dependent upon the game in regards to how you time it, it would be impossible for me to suggest how to do so. After all this is done, you now have a baseline to work off of for later AND know where you stand compared to the WR. 

**4) Learning Time**

Break all the tricks, menu operations, whatever it is in this game you need to learn up into categories that are either easy, medium or hard difficulty. How you practice these is entirely up to you, but personally I go for the hard stuff first since it usually encompasses the easy/medium stuff in most games. Our goal here is to build up muscle memory for ALL things in ALL categories as best as possible. Do not worry or think about full runs right now, you want to solely focus on learning what, why, you'll be doing them more fluidly and the execution you have for them will improve massively over time. Repeating this for everything you've set into the categories mentioned earlier until you're capable of holding a conversation with someone while performing the actions basically out of almost pure muscle memory. There will be tricks this isn't possible for just due to how they work but it's assumed anyone serious about a game will know this.

**5) The Other Side of Learning**

Now break the run up into sections, music references and other ""tells"" the game can provide here is what you should strive for as well as consistency. Again, we want to be able to do all of this while being distracted, so that should be your goal as it was before, having a friend try to distract you with conversation is a great way to push this muscle memory building.

**6) It Starts**

Go back and do a full run and completely destroy your casual run times. The difference now is that we've got all that muscle memory, you will lose the muscle memory you've built up for other sections of the game.

**7) The Reset Trap and Why You Avoid It**

Eventually you'll begin doing races, the run is totally impossible to recover. This is false, many of the more famous runners have 1 or 2 pretty bad splits in their WR runs (by their standards). When you fall into this kind of logic of resetting for even the most minor thing, you WILL burn yourself out extremely quickly even if you love the game. The only time you should start resetting constantly is if something you do completely removes any chance of the run being salvageable later. For instance, if I can save 14 seconds throughout my entire run and a split i get is in the red by 6, I'm going to keep going. If that red dips past 14 seconds, then I'll reset right away because it is impossible to recover any further time loss in regards to the improving my time overall. **AdamSDA** ""There's also the issue of wanting a good

**8) Community Help**

Never let someone with a better time get to you. If someone beats your time, go practice their methods and generally don't ever view it as ""I've been defeated and can't beat the new time!"" The community for speed running is honestly one of the most helpful and respectful communities I've ever been a part of. You should never be afraid to ask for help, tips or anything regarding speed running at all, people here usually will go out of their way to help you.

**9) TAS Strats**

Once you're on par with WR runs and pretty confident in your abilities, which boosts the standards at which you hold your runs thus overall making your confidence and comfort with the game even higher after some time.

Questions asked frequently/answered on this subreddit:

**What is a Split?**

Splits are the times you keep track of while playing through a game. They enable you to see how far ahead/behind you are compared to a previous run of the game at a specific spot. Most runners have splits on the screen when they stream. The most common program for splits is WSplit

**Whats is a single segment and a multi-segmented run? And whats the difference?**

shnizalwizal: ""A single segment is a one sitting run

**About RNG

[gnuvince's RNG description](http://www.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/1fzhoo/a_couple_of_questions/caflp2k)

About random numbers, computers do not have random number generators, they have pseudo random number generators. What does that mean? It means that a sequence of numbers generated by a PRNG ""looks"" random, but is actually the output of a deterministic process.

These PRNGs work by selecting an initial value (called the seed; usual candidates are the current time

next curr = (curr * 214013 + 2531011) `mod` 2^15

And here are the numbers it generates for different seeds (0 and 1):

ghci&gt; take 20 $ iterate next 0
[0,23381,8388,19575,21854,5801,16072,898,23782,25994
ghci&gt; take 20 $ iterate next 1
[1,1850,28949,24452,4151,2590,30825,29227,12383,7891

1358385369.0,16pzxo,AGDQ is officially over. Just some closing thoughts I had on the event and speed running.,WastedPanda,79,7,55,"I hope this is in the right place. I couldn't really think of anywhere else to put it as it's about a speedrunning event. If this violates the rules please delete it

Another AGDQ has come to a close, and just general life to sit in a center far away from many of their homes to marathon their respective games, back to back, as fast as they could for the enjoyment of all the viewers for a noble cause of a charity donation drive. While providing interesting trivia or detailed explanation of the way the glitches they utilize in their runs, they show their passing for gaming, speedrunning, a community that they all rally around

As always, Carl Sagan, and Trihex wowed the viewers with masterful runs, filled with interesting explanations of the different tricks, glitches, and bugs while also explaining why they work the way they do, and sometimes even detailing us a bit of history for the glitches when they could.

For the more unknown runners; two specific people stuck out to me personally

1. The first runner which stood out to me was BlueGlass. Now now, he was sitting there or I could hear him talking and knew he was in the room watching off camera. Constantly asking questions, laughing, or even just viewing the runs whenever possible. Legitimately interested in speedrunning with all the different games and their respective glitches. Fascinated about the history or explanations of why the glitches work the way they do. Having what seemed to be the time of his life as he just sat there hanging out with some of the people of the speedrunning community and watching them work their magic. Of course, we also can't forget the way he powered through the Ecco games, same smile on his face and still laughing, even in a game that I know for a fact had been quite possibly one the most difficult game many of us have played. BlueGlass stated he'll start streaming after he's situated back at home, and it's no secret that the chat fell in love with him for his slightly awkward

2. The second runner which stood out to me was one that I hadn't seen play any other game during the marathon, but the only game I seen him play was "" El Viento. "" What stood out to me about Spineshark was his first impression when he sat down to play. A large smile on his face, and only saying at first "" I'm not very good at this game, but I really like playing it. "" I knew I'd enjoy the run just because of how enthusiastic he was just to play the short, twenty minute run of the game. He spent the entire time playing talking about the levels, bosses, things to remember when running it, but *he did it all while having a huge smile on his face and having fun just playing a simple game.* It didn't matter if he was the best ever or not

Though I only mentioned two specific runners right there, quite the opposite of what I think. I had a blast watching every run I could, even runs that didn't even seem that interesting to me at first like Skryim or Final Fantasy IX. ( Of course, I changed my mind on those two. Skyrim was pretty interesting to watch, and I had a blast with the FF9 watching because Spike and Puwexil were pretty interesting in their actions and how they explained everything )

One note I must address is the some negative points I noticed. A lot of people I seen on different forums and in chat were complaints about how chat was being run. "" IRC is filled with dictator mods, it's the lesser of two evils. Sure, it's an example of many being punished for the acts of a few, but to those complaining, where you keeping a good eye on chat? Sure, during bigger like Cosmo or Siglemic you had their typical watchers going about with their typical trolling, but relatively mild jokes. Of course Trihex's HEXMEN were out in full force during his JSR-HD run, were mild and fun trolling at most. Some people showed that they could not be trusted during other runner's games though. When Emptyeye and Mrs. Emptyeye were up

1. Yes

2. Many of the times the chat was shut off, others in the room, or even hatred directed at the mods for keeping them in line.

3. Many people think it's fine to spam or chat like they typically do in their normal speedrun chats. This is not always the case. Keep in mind that this was a charity marathon. You have people here that aren't normally used to the speedrunning chats. You have people from the charity that they're streaming for, but they still need to retain some professionalism. Where as your trolling with twitch faces is normally met with a couple laughs when you say that the BrainSlug face is "" BigNig "" you have to remember that they can't have comments like that in chat because they don't need accusations of racism or disrespect towards any race/color/creed against them because it could hurt the charity that they're representing. Also, don't expect all the people who may not typically watch speedrunning streams to fully understand the FrankerZ Kappa RESET spam.

4. When you're being deliberately disrespectful and asking questions like "" Hey

I enjoyed this years AGDQ. I'm really looking forward to SGDQ, and am wondering how they'll top it next year. All in all, major props to EVERYONE who helped make it possible through planning, donating, playing, or even the tech set-up. Can't wait to see the stream next year .

In closing, I'm not great. That's why my titles have NEVER been "" WR attempts. "" However, you have people that view Sig, Trihex, Cosmo, or other big runners like that, who then go around and view other people's channels as well. I can't tell you the amount of times I've had people come into my chat and watched me play for a minute or two before telling me that I suck and to just give up... Now, and I'll usually just laugh and agree with them. I only play SM64 because I think it's fun to keep myself on my toes and practice a few different games while looking for the next game to take seriously speedrunning. However

Remember, but being outright disrespectful whether it's in a personal channel chat, or during a marathon isn't right. It brings a negative view of speedrunning all over the community. Support all the runners whenever possible, and if you have any problems then keep them to yourself or take them up directly with the person they're directed at privately and not make a large amount of drama.

I just opened up the stream when he started talking to him on Skype and I'm not sure what to think of him. He did sound like a nice guy

What do you guys think?

Edit:

I guess this is Kryptic's twitch http://www.twitch.tv/krypticsader

Edit2: 

He donated some more and is now at $3810

Edit3:

I just noticed it says ""Krypticsader $5310"" at the top of the stream now. Insanity.

Edit4: 

$5385

Edit5:

$7785                              Is this real life?

Edit6:

**$10000**

Edit7:

**The full story** 

This is from the second skype call and is all we know at the moment.

His name is apparently Tyler(?)(Just tell me if I should not out his name or anything

Tyler is 21 years old and works as a fire fighter. He ended up in the hospital and watched Cosmos stream while staying there. He recently got paid and decided to donate.

So
	
Now, but also some issues that I seen, and I wanted to point some of those issues out in hopes that we could remember to try and avoid them to the best of our ability. This mainly focuses on the kind of chat that was going on during AGDQ, and the negativity/disrespect that was going through it at times.
	
1. Everyone involved are people just like us, and money to travel and play these games. Sure, they're "" just playing games "" but at the same time they've put a lot of time and effort into making sure that each individual run is as best as they can make it for our enjoyment, which isn't easy by any means because it's easy to become forgetful of how difficult some games are when you regularly watch the best runners at the games play. Being disrespectful or rude to them is just a huge slap in the face for what they're giving up to bring this event to us. This doesn't just apply to those running games either. It also includes those who helped organize the event, and those who are there to help out and make things easier for this marathon to go off without a hitch. 
	
2. There are cases of drama happening every now and then, and in turn help make the problem bigger. Let's try to avoid that because it it can turn others against one another and hurt them.
	
3. This event is for a great cause. Remember that it will probably be featured in many places, and the occasional ASCII art spam is common among speedrunning chat, as is a bit of trolling, but remember that not everyone there may be a regular follower of speedruns, or even a regular stream watcher. Our chat will reflect not only upon each individual runner playing at the time/the SRL and SDA communities/and the speedrunning community at large, but it could ALSO reflect upon Doctor's Without Borders because that's what the event is raising money for.
	
4. Respect the mods in the chat. There's most likely going to be 1-4k people watching at all time, they're simply overwhelmed and cannot keep up with moderation needs. Remember that if people behave themselves, the chat can stay up more and mods don't need to stress out over what's acceptable and what's not. Once again, they're people too who are giving up their time, and at some points sleep, to help this event.

5. **Racism, sexism and all other hateful comments have no place at this event. Check that crap at the door because no one wants to see it. For those who do see those comments in chats, remember that if enough people are positive in chat, that we can drown out that hate. Always seek to be actively positive to try and help this event go even more smoothly. Chat can be a major hype train that sets the mood for people's runs and that's good, however it doesn't take much for people to ruin it for others. Keep in mind that these men and women do not need to do this, and if it gets progressively worse each year, you never know whether or not they'll just give up on it as something that could have been had it not been for the negativity. Let's keep it clean, and positive to show them that this is something we'd like to see continue for a long time.**
	
I know that the /r/speedrun community is normally well behaved in chats ( ...right guys? ..guys? ) but not everyone is. If any runners see this, to talk to them about it. I'm sure this won't help the issue at large with chats going nuts, but at least it's an attempt to remind people to remember to read the rules for the chats and be respectful to everyone involved.
	
With that being said, as I'm sure many of us do. So let's try to do our best to help them out by not overloading them with moderation needs, or by being disrespectful. Support all the runners, and respect that they're coming together for a great cause.
	
Thanks for reading :)

RunnerGuy is a big fan of FrankerZ, and the streamer who is being raided becomes the ""conductor"" who picks the next person for the raid. Runnerguy would direct the train to Twitch users, most of whom were SRL people and knew about it, in order to see their reactions. Eventually, the train was beginning to run out of SRL people to link to (RunnerGuy wanted to find people who *didn't* know about the FrankerZ train, in order to get a better ""LOL WTF"" reaction), so non-SRL people began being linked as well. Some of these users were from Team Ludendi

Twitch user Crumps2 was linked, however, enacted an incredibly large number of bans so quickly (because the FrankerZ spam came so quickly and in large numbers) that it itself was IP banned for ironically ""spamming"" the chat. Subscriber mode was turned on in the chat, and Crumps2 and Itaku were both visibly angry. Itaku allegedly said that he was going to go through the chat logs and IP ban any user who participated in the spam raid (later clarified by another admin named George that only ASCII art spammers would be banned). Itaku and Crumps2 allegedly used a few slurs against the people from the FrankerZ train in their rage, and Crumps2 laughed at the raid by telling them it was only going to raise his viewer count to the point where he could apply for Twitch partner. The combination of the bans, alleged use of slurs, and Crumps2's condescending remarks angered the people from the FrankerZ train, as he was offline) chat and IAteYourPie's (in the middle of a Paper Mario All Cards race

Now it gets even crazier. A lot of mud was slinged around, and tells people to report Itaku ON STREAM. The admin named George shows up and turns on subscriber mode on Pie's stream to have a direct conversation with him as well as the other SRL runners on Pie's chat. I'll try and sum up the arguments both sides made here:  

FrankerZ Train/Speed Runners:

1) IP banning was a disproportionate reaction to the FrankerZ train.  
2) FrankerZ train was friendly
3) FrankerZ train exposes viewers to new streamers.  

Crumps2/Itaku:  

1) It was unnecessary spam
2) Caused chat servers to slow down
3) Raiders broke the streamer's chat rules.  

Both sides kept to their own chats

Familiarise yourself with the game. Familiarise yourself with streaming. Familarise yourself with how Speed Runs Live works. [This is the FAQ here](http://speedrunslive.com/faq/). 

The channel we will be meeting up in is:

Room: #/r/speedrun

There is no need to confirm your attendance. If you don't arrive within 15 minutes of the time

**Hints &amp; Tips** [](/WinWaker)

1. Keep in mind is that it takes time for your blaster bolts
strike your enemies. Far-away enemies take longer to hit - but if you want to
stay safe
1) For moving enemies
If you're confident your bolts will strike
next enemy.
2. Don't be afraid to lob a few nova bombs to help clear stray enemies so that
you'll get a high score
before you deploy your last one - you might need it to get out of a desperate
situation.  
4. Rolling is your friend - your rolls can deflect anything except collisions and missiles. It's a skill of central importance.  
5. Do play this game in stereo. Not only does it sound better
able to use the left-and-right channels as directional cues for the sounds of
engines
6. The easier and simplist route seems to be 'Level 1'  
7. [My first splits with a Game Over and two additional lives lost.](http://i.imgur.com/SNvyMqh.png) It would easily be under 25 minutes.

(Thanks to [Will Atlantic](http://www.gamefaqs.com/snes/588690-star-fox/faqs/60462) )

All participants are welcome. We are not racing to each other

**Updates** [](/HotPokket)

1. [These are the results from the Time Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1H2DviF7ea4znE0cxGFNLzXKeFbROZSU5Ltg8IO_s_TM/viewanalytics). And [this is the result from time preferred](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/oimg?key=0Apn2mdLhG_pidHVBRGxjeVAyQVhaTmI5el9HcGE1WGc&amp;oid=2&amp;zx=lix98ki3iqog). The data from these two have decided which day and time the race will be held. We might ask the same questions again in a month to see if the timing is still efficient.
2. The final score for the game suggestions is tied 10 each between [Star Fox any% (SNES) and Super Meat Boy any% (PC)!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Apn2mdLhG_pidE5iNUdiYVN0VDNmblFNV2l4Wk96dnc#gid=0). This is actually preferred, with a knowledge of the game selected. Star Fox was chosen for this week (five days practice) because it is a rail shooter which needs less practice than Super Meat Boy.
3. **[SUPER MEAT BOY IS ON SALE FOR £2.39 FOR A VERY LIMITED TIME. BUY NOW IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN NEXT WEEKS RACE.](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40800/)**

(wall of text incoming!)

After seeing the SGDQ 16 star race with siglemic, I burrowed a friend's cartridge so I could finally try those awesome glitches myself. And I must say, clipping through the doors with MIPS looks easy, but man, I had the hardest time in my life! But the first time I could do it, I felt something I haven't felt in a long, long time.

Pure

After clearing the second Bowser battle, probably from watching poor mario blast thru the door super fast and backwards xD). Did the same thing with the 70 star door, but I did it wrong the first time and warped to wet-dry world :(. There goes like 5 minutes! 

Finally I'm at the final level. Didn't do any YOLO strats to reach the pipe since I didn't want to risk ruinning my time (as if I had some sort fo WR to beat or something xD). I reach bowser

It took me MONTHS to beat this game 16 years ago, it BLOWS MY MIND so much. It's been a long time since I had this much fun with a game, and I enjoyed every single second :D.

tl;dr: First speedrun in my life

The idea was for the people who run the SDA marathons to see this data and use it to make better schedules in the future. Somehow I get the feeling they won't really care though.

Anyways

I got this a couple weeks ago, but I never thought I would get it any time soon.  I gained some confidence while practicing it at AGDQ and decided I was close enough to go for it when I got back home.


What's cool about this running this game in the any% category is that there's practically no RNG at all to worry about, I could probably get a 10:35 (it might take a while though).  Still, this is a pretty clean run, and I'm happy to at least have achieved this time.

As for me, Mario Kart 64, FF VII, VIII, and IV, and Super Mario Bros 2. As for games that I am looking forward to speedrun, I am pretty flexible. I wouldn't speedrun more popular or long games though including Mario 64 or Zeldas.

How about you? Do you have any suggestions of a game we can all race together? A good beginner game might be a circuit of Super Mario Kart. What are your thoughts?

**Edit**: There seems to be some interest already, so don't be afraid of being bad. I doubt a lot of us will get much practice. I am unfortunately busy this weekend (all of Saturday, most of Sunday daytime), but this doesn't prevent you guys from organising your own events without me.

**Goal:** Complete All Cups 50cc any%  
**Estimate:** 40 minutes

**Emulator** (if needed): Snes9x 1.53

1366536017.0,1csjmp,"Setting a ""Bounty"" on a Specific Speed Run",DanceDanceIkaruga,18,1,5,"What's the best way to go about putting a bounty on a particular gaming challenge?

In general it's something I would be interested in offering habitually (much like Erdos did with math problems) and I would love to see the practice become popular. Here's an example bounty which happens to be one I actually really want to make

*New Super Mario Bros. 2* has a ""Coin Rush"" mode where you have to get as many coins as possible. I enjoy playing it and have developed what seems to me the fastest strategy for scoring the maximum 30000 coins per run. Today I decided to make and upload to youtube [a video](http://youtu.be/9chvnBNd4A4) of my strategy. However, say, $25 to the first person to do the level with 79 seconds left on the clock and, say, $50 to anyone able to do it with 81 or better. (I like to think I would start with moderately generous bounties and as the system became more popular among both players and setters a vague market would emerge where the community developed a broad ""feel"" for what is an appropriate bounty for a particular challenge.)

The above is an example

Submitting a run is simple enough (video uploaded/emailed)

1.) How to publicise a bounty to the right people in a credible fashion? I thought about mentioning in IRC and chat channels of known speedrunners, if they even saw the message at all? I recall some fighting game combo challenges which have been publicised on Eventhubs to great success, so perhaps speedrunning blogs and news sites are the way to go. What speedrunning blogs and news sites are there that would be open to posting such bounties?

2.) How to persuade participants that they would indeed be paid? One solution seems to be to initially transfer the funds to a well-known, or back to the bounty setter when the deadline was up if no-one had won. (Deadlines on a bounty seem appropriate given the tendency for money which hangs around in one place too long to be eventually spent. This could be a problem if that ""open bounty"" is suddenly solved 10 years later and one week before Christmas.)

3.) How to decide if a submission has successfully met the conditions of the bounty? In my Mario example I feel it would be obvious to me

4, ...) ?

As a closing comment, it was great. That's different from a bounty, but one idea is the same as what I'm describing here: a financial incentive from people who are interested in the hobby to people who are good at the hobby to direct their efforts in a particular way.

---------------------------
EDIT 2:
Since some people have had issues viewing the document

Guide layout (Guide will be getting major Overhaul soon)

[General Guide Layout](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bwryo3kpddohau2/Secret-of-Evermore.pdf)

~~Saturn's new Act 1 route~~ [Obsoleted Today]

[Act 1 Route Ingredient Guide](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m9j6qd8jzcg4rdc/Saturn%27s%20Ingredient%20Act%201%20Route.pdf)

--------------------------

**Project Goals:**

* Generate interest in the game through a well presented and detailed guide.

* Provide enough information for each area that will let new players understand how and why things are done.

* Offer optional detours/routes where appropriate that others may wish to explore and experiment with.

* Detailed maps with paths clearly marked (where appropriate) and items to collect displayed.

* Strategy for bosses within the guide will be tested and timed to be effective compared against most other strategies for them

* Fairly aggressive updating, which I'll be updating tonight.

* Eventually there will be formulas for alchemy spell damage so people can experiment within the guide itself to understand and explore why we do certain things with the spells.

* Set a slightly higher standard for guides, lacking information, and/or not well organized. I'm sure some people share this feeling and I'm hoping to provide something that isn't remotely like those previous guides.

--------------------------

**Progress:**

&gt; [02-06-13] Guide has been updated for new route all the way to Act 2 Start

&gt; [02-07-13] I now have a run to go off of that's solid enough for further acts

&gt; [02-10-13] I have to rewrite the majority of the guide due to a trick found that obsoletes the TAS.

--------------------------

I would absolutely love some constructive criticism on this

3. I've had a few requests from people asking for only console games to be included in races. They are free to emulate for 24 hours. Opposed to buying a game such as Super Meat Boy or VVVVVV for only a week. What is the general consensus?

I've recently gotten into speedrunning MGS 4 but I'm only slowly getting into it because I'm still in the learning process. 
I've also been working on MGS 3 Foxhound single segment which I've done with using saves already where I've had some speedrun methods implemented. I also use speedrun methods for my single segment even though I'm still just doing practice runs. So while I've beed doing these practice runs I've been thinking that I might aswell speedrun MGS3 even though it seems to be more figured out then MGS4.

So are there still any MGS 3/4 speedrunners here or in any of the communitys (are there even more then SDA and SRL?).


I've also started streaming like 3 days ago and I've been enjoying it so much that I really feel like starting speedrunning mgs 3 once I get my single segment foxhound and mgs 4 when I've learned enough to get atleast solid runs.

1369656210.0,1f4tc2,New to speedrunning with questions and need of advice,Ragnus,12,1,5,"Hello

I've been watching a lot of streams on twitchTV of speedrunners or MGS of people who don't actively speedrun but most likely have done it in the past. Watching the MGS in particular I've convinced myself to get a ps3 (I only had a 360 till recently) so I could also enjoy MGS4 and
the upcoming MGS V. I've had the hd collection for the 360 already but played mgs 2 and 3 once and didn't even finish PW until I watched the MGS streams.

I've then started to go for the highest rank in the game as practice because in a speedrun you would meet the same requirements (no kills/alerts/continues) so it was/is helpful to aim for the rank before bothering about serious speedruns. Right now I only achieved the highest rank for MGS3 and I could already start practicing on what I can to get a good time while it still would be not even close enough to call it a good run. I also have many strats/routes that I made up myself because I didn't bother looking up routes/starts for everything.

The other MGS game I'm trying to get the highest rank on right now is MGS4. I'm still busy doing the routing but I'm doing just slow progress due to many reasons. One reason is

Another reason is
The reason why I atleast want to learn how to speedrun the already existing MGS games is so I can hopefully, in this case, would be MGS V.

So most Speedrunners I watch play rather old games so from watching streams I don't feel like I get much input on rather new games that I might want to run.

________________________________________________________________________________
To sum up questions:
1. Is it worth to get into speedrunning for a game which is mostly figured out already and might not have many active runners

2. What are the best ways to practice? Should Is it more important to learn everything about the game (e.g. mechanics) or should I focus on learning the best existing route? (probably differs based on the game)

3. How to I find information about other active runners? From what I've seen on SpeedRunsLive.com they don't even list mgs3 and 4 in their list of games.

________________________________________________________________________________

I appreciate all kind of advice you could give for somebody who is interested in speedrunning and wants to get into it.

* If at all possible
* Understand the different stats between characters. DK Jr and Bowser play very differently to Peach and Yoshi.
* The timer begins when we select the Mushroom Cup. The timer ends when we cross the finish line of Mario Circuit 4 (the fifth and final race in the Star Cup). Your splits are up to you.
* When you finish the fifth and tenth race (the last race of the Mushroom and Flower Cup), or even just R.
* Coins increase your speed. I think (correct me if I'm wrong)
* Ease off the gas pedal and use your momentum to glide around a tight corner
* Respect Trollser Castle 2 and 3.

This is my currently known compilation of warp glitches in the game. 

Reset Spawning - This allows you to reset into a level. Doing this skips the opening cutscene that starts when you load a level for the first time. To do this, click reset. If you take too long it'll go away and you'll enter the level normally.

Starite Warp - Upon reset spawning into a level

Death Stall - Just found this one, die, click reset and open the map with M. Then, press F, and you'll be able to enter the mission while dead. Finishing the mission will let you do the Starite warp again.

Death Enter - Again just found this one, but instead at the NORMAL enter point. 

Death Warp - This one works very oddly. I haven't entirely figured it out, or the first camera spot of the last map you were in.

Mission Swap - On Starite Spawning, it's just cool.

Windy Warp - This is a long warp using windy items. Windy items push you right, which (in some cases) will cause you to jet across the map. This is very volatile and may end up in messing up your run. There are uses for it that save time. 

Also there are some crashes with warps,False,,t5_2sf9e,False,,,t3_1ae65w

This is the link to the video

The game is quite easy to route because you just need to find the shortest races and marked men and just do them every license. This game is very repetitive because you will be doing most events 4/5 times because every license your races reset it self. This is a Any% speedrun up to the Burnout License

If you have any question

Edit 1: I Will post a image tomorrow with what races are best to do

Edit 2: Here the link to the races to do http://i.imgur.com/nFvOJmQ.jpg

The List of cars to use:

Hunter Cavalry (Starting car)

Nakamura Ikusa GT (Unlock when you get C License)

Carson Fastback (Unlock when you get B License)

Jensen P12 (This should be the only car you need to takedown and you would use it for the rest of the game)

Rossolini Tempesta (Unlock when you get A License)

Rossolini Tempesta GT (This Car is very hard to use)

Touge Sport (If you cant find the P12 but you find this car

There is no specific route on this

Little tip: When you doing a road rage or Stunt run and you have reached the target score

If you do the wrong events there is a way to leave the event without actually quitting the game, if you do this you will leave the event, just press yes and then leave the menu and bam you have quit the event.

Edit 3: Another Tip: Don't take out any cars when in free roam because it will make the cutscene in the garage a lot longer so just leave them driving around paradise city.",,t5_2sf9e,1375480545.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/1jjo9b/first_burnout_paradise_speedrun_wr/

It seems similar to the Orb glitch in SMW or, like the Rambi barrel or the enemy sprites, are those which are close to the Kongs which makes me think that the programming may have initialized and stored the sprite in memory to spawn, but the ""trick barrel"" might make the program perform some check (""Are both Kongs alive?"") to make sure that one of them spawns and this may in turn explain why some of the more bizarre sprites (the shadow ones, the flashy-glowy ones, etc.).

There are not too many differences in the above videos. I managed to get to the pillar fairly quickly in both videos. So that takes away my first thought about how speed matters. 

For more proof

Here's some other reasons I suspect Shy Guy moves:

* My method of reaching the pillar (using Long Jump instead of the Jump Dive)

* Keeping Shy Guy in my line of sight

* Touching the area to the right (after jumping over the hill) that is not quick sand.

So how do *you* deal with this stuff? Do you take a break for a week or something knowing that you'll get rusty and will have to retrain a bit before getting back into shape? Do you keep at it even though your thumbs and your pride hurt? Do you accept the outlook that you're probably never going to improve and find another game to run? Or do you do something completely different?

I speedrun games like Quake and Serious Sam for fun but this is the game I got the most serious on and I managed to get pretty high on the xbox live single player leader boards for Marble Blast Ultra.

Since then my xbox had broken and my account was deactivated and all my times lost but I recently founnd a pc port of the game which I downloaded and I am working on getting my old times back.

It doesnt connect to any global leaderboards any longer but it does record your times on each level and I still spend a lot of time trying to beat my times and get each one as low as possible.

If anyone is interested you can download the game for free from [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Akn8CzMOPJY) in the description.

I have just started speedrunning and I've been trying to map a way through Sapphire. I spent a long time deciding Torchic/Mudkip and I have decided Torchic (Please say if I am wrong). He seems to be slow at the start but benefits so much after the 4th Gym. But the first gym is such a pain. What is the best way to hit 16 before Roxanne?

* Is emulator standard/acceptable?  I have it for Genesis
 * Answer: Emulator would not qualify for SDA submission.  (I should have guessed)
* When does the timer start?
 * Answer: From other runs I have been showed
* What are the differences between difficulties?  Is it only the amount of lives you start with
* Is it not actually necessary to get all the flutes in the third level?  moooh seems to skip one and still completes the level (Agrabah Rooftops).
 * Answer: See next question.
* What causes the magic carpet to take you on the longer route or the shorter route on the third level (Agrabah Rooftops)?
 * Answer: Grabbing one of the flutes.
* Is in mandatory to complete the magic carpet ride challenge (Rug Ride) ?  It is 2 minutes quicker to just let yourself die 3 times.
 * Answer: Seems there are two categories because of this.

So I don't think anyone runs this game at all, so on a technicality I guess it's a WR, but I don't put much stock in that.


I routed this game myself over the past month (would have been faster, because no one has ever even heard of this game).


I'd love to recommend this game to people, that's a TON of fun. mutter grumble grumble).  I do plan to continue to run it and skim time off (I think with some optimization I can take off 2+ minutes in a single level) though, and I'd welcome competition. Far more fun to run games other people also run.

i'm in the speedrunning community more or less for 2 years but until now i have been a lurker and just informed but never submitted any runs. Now i got to a level


* At first i want to run the PAL-Version of the game and since it is a difference of 50 to 60 fps between the NTSC and the PAL Version i guess this would open up a new catergory


* And i got the problem


* And last but not least - the game takes about 10 to 11 hours to finish so i would prefer taking a break after maybe 5 hours. I would not retry and would just jump in at the place i did before without any changes .. just a slight pause. Would it still count as a single segment (since it is without retries) or would it count as segmented

1375131871.0,1jawmy,For my first speedrun to learn I've narrowed it down to a few and I'd like your opinion on it :),MagicHobbes,8,4,19,"In order of least difficult for me to learn to greatest difficulty to learn:

Super Meat Boy: I'm actually pretty good at this and can do the light world quite speedy. I've talked about it on my stream before but we'll see.

Ocarina of Time Any%: I definitely think I could do this. Cosmo really inspired me here. Plus it's just very cool run that I'd love to learn. Although I don't want to end up hating one of my favourite games.

Hotline Miami: Just a cool run

Super Mario Sunshine: I don't have a lot to say other than that I've watched a lot of streams on it so I actually get the strats more-so than the others on this list.

Super Mario 64 16 Star Run: It's shorter and wouldn't require quite as much focus. But I'd still need a ton of practice

Super Mario World (Probably Any% but I'm up for aything): I'm most interested in this because I love the game so much but I need a lot of practice. I don't know the strats as well as the others on this list. I'm trying to catch more streams from it but it seems like I'm a ways away from even attempting it.

Help me choose what to learn! I'm so excited to start running. SGDQ has gotten me so hyped over them and I'd love to go to AGDQ 2014 just to watch :)",,t5_2sf9e,1375132366.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/1jawmy/for_my_first_speedrun_to_learn_ive_narrowed_it/

1374520605.0,1itxo7,Can anyone recommend a good Capture Card for AV/S-Video console footage?,Lolinsworth,6,1,10,"Hey guys

I am wanting to get into recording and possibly streaming my Super Mario World 64 &amp; Star Fox 64 Speedrun attempts but not sure what the best way to go about capturing it. I don't like emulating these sort of things as it just doesn't feel authentic to me.

What sort of capture card do you guys recommend for AV/S-Video recording? I am wanting to run it through a splitter so I can continue playing on my TV and have it split onto a recording program

I couldn't find any details on the side far

Edit: While I am at it

Edit PT2: Decided to go with the Dazzle DVC 100 and the Cable Electronics LABS AV for a powered splitter. Also going to pick up a male to male AV Cable as well just to be safe and make sure I have one so I can continue playing on my TV instead of my computer monitor. Thanks for all the input guys!
