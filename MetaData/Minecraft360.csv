Heaven forbid you dare to compare the two versions. It's happened to me several times now and I've seen it happen to other people as well. I'm not even some PC elitist coming from the PC version of Minecraft to claim this one is horrible. I prefer to play the game on the Xbox and I really didn't have a choice because the adventure update made the game too laggy to play on my aging laptop. The Xbox version runs smoothly and I prefer the interface

I hate to be one of those people who go 'hur dur bring on the downvotes!!!11!' but I seriously doubt this post will get much love and will probably even prove my point about this weird hatred the subreddit has when it comes to the PC version being brought up in discussion.

Anyways, thick forest. Just beyond that is a mix of more plains and extreme hills. The very northern center end has a very small Taiga biome, and the whole north eastern portion is a mix of plains and hills. The very north eastern corner houses a very small oddball desert biome with snow on one end of it. However, the very best part is that in the very center of the map sits a single small island, which is a mushroom biome. 

There are several deep holes and cave entrances dotted all over the map, in a good way. 

I know of one partly abandoned mineshaft that I broke down into when I was digging a quarry. It had 3 branches going off it. Two of them were dead ends

So I swam. There was a mushroom island nearby, I swam some more.

I was about ready to call it quits again, smallish tree in the distance. Now it was getting dark and my hunger was finally falling. I quickly punched the tree into logs, and luckily got a sapling in the process. Planted it and started digging in the ground with my bare hands in the dark praying I wouldn't get jumped by a zombie.

Dug a tiny cave and sealed it off. Whew! Safety! Even if I was starving, 2 steaks, 3 seeds and some dirt. It would be close, but I could actually survive if I was smart!

I made a crafting table and a wooden pickaxe. I couldn't even light up the area yet so I mined down in the dark. After getting some cobble I made a stove and sacrificed a precious piece of wood to make a piece of charcoal to cook the steaks. Made a stone pickaxe and wooden hoe. Tunnelled down and found some iron and a seam of coal. Brought it all up and started melting down the ore and made some torches.

Made a hole and peeked outside: still dark. So I went back down the mine and got a whole bunch of iron and coal.

In the morning, I had made it! Against all odds I found the only tree on the map and had a supply of food. Success!

So first things first

Stared at the screen. All my inventory scattered. My little hovel destroyed. Continue or quit to title?

I had to quit. That was just way too painful.

If anyone else wants to give it a try... The seed is 5432. The single tree (as far as I could see) is on a small island way on the bottom right of the map. Good luck!",self,t5_2tjtf,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft360/comments/1fhsjb/ouch/

OneRandomCatFact (*A group of cats is called a “clowder.”*) has brought to my attention that we don't have a prize set up for the WBC! It slipped my mind.

Now, or Microsoft Points. I'd love to get you guys MC Points, but I honestly can't.

But we need a prize! So if you guys have any ideas or suggestions

I'll edit this as we get more comments.

**Forgive me if there are any mistakes.  Long time lurker

This was Phase 1 of my winter break project with my brother.  This was our first big project with Minecraft 360 and we're pretty happy with it.  We have plans to add a downed at-at when we have some more time.  We needed to have it all cramped together to make sure the draw distance could catch a good portion of our work.  I kinda like it super close anyway :D  We also chose to leave the natural land in place and only make changes when necessary.  

Phase 2 will consist of building echo base itself.  Hanger, command room, Millenium Falcon, etc etc.

Let me know what you think! ^begentle

Here are the questions:
  -creepers.  Do they ever go away?  If not

  -there was an option upon creating the world that said something about 'strongholds/villages will form.'  When exactly does that happen?

  -what should be my next objectives?  Any tips or warnings would be greatly appreciated!

  -how do I join other players worlds?

  -where can I find rarer minerals?  Just look around for mines and dig around?

Anyways, off work on weekends.  GT is same as username 'ChronDonDiggity.'  If anybody wants to show me around a little or doesn't mind playing with a newbie, add me!

However

* first skim the [wiki page](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Redstone_Circuits)
* watch some tutorials on basic circuits (I recommend [CNBMinecraft](http://www.youtube.com/user/CNBMinecraft) and [EthosLabs](http://www.youtube.com/user/EthosLab) )
* copy along with the tutorial on a superflat map leaving signs making notes on parts of the circuit explaining why it works
* build the circuits from memory as best you can
* then try your luck building your own basic circuits
* finally build some slightly advanced ones (seven digit displays, and the like) and label the circuits with signs (e.g. ""hey this it's an AND gate, Block switcher, etc)

After doing all this you should have a somewhat understanding of Redstone contraptions and be able to recognize the circuits used in tutorials without them even mentioning. From here you can start constructing your own inventions and who knows you could be the next Etho!

1352874193.0,1364c8,I've had a lot of fun running a server the last few days   and witnessed a lot of hilarity.  I wanna hear about other peoples unique experiences.,CordouroyStilts,38,6,23,"So I started a server sometime last week and posted my GT on reddit and the minecraftforum.  It was no rules survival and I got probably 20-30 unique players altogether.  Anyways

     When I started the server I know that because of the 'anything goes' rules
looking to gank my shit.  My first thought was to build underground and keep a very hidden entrance and operate
from down there.  I mined down to diamond territory with my partners and we built a very nice underground farm
and kept all of our best stuff in a chest hidden behind a random block.
  
     This was good for awhile
while opening a chest.  We'll call him ""Bubsy"".  He had found me on his map and just dug straight down into our 
base.  He killed me
victor!  And I had a new set of armor and random goodies thanks to my fallen enemy.  He kept coming though. 
He knew where our base was and knew our treasure was somewhere.  We decided we had to move.  We stripped
that place of everything of value

     We walked until we hit the far corner of the map and started building a castle on an ice island with the 
endless amounts of cobblestone we had acquired from living underground.  We thought being on an island in a 
corner it would be easy to keep from being snuck up on(gamertags and health bar aren't visible on my server).  
We were wrong.  We were found and attacked a few times by Bubsy
character found our base and snuck up behind my friend who was looking in a chest.  He was able to dump a 
bucket of lava on the ground behind my friend before he knew he was even there.  It killed him and burned up his
supplies
and attack because the stairs were blocked with lava.  In the meantime
(luckily the good stuff was hidden very well).  

     Our location was compromised yet again.  We would have to find a better way to survive.  We packed up our
things again and set out for a hopefully safer base.  My friend had the idea of a ""skybase"" floating in the air with
a waterfall for an elevator.  This seemed like the safest way. 

     While exploring a nearby village I found that someone had set up a living space in one of the smaller
the side houses.  I opened the chest and it was PACKED.  Mostly with non-exciting things but it had a few 
diamond and a DIAMOND SWORD that I was pretty sure once belonged to me.  Bubsy had taken one from me 
during one of his attacks
sting on Bubsy and took it home.  Brimming with the feeling of victory again.

     Later I had spotted a player wandering the coastline near our 'skybase' who clearly saw our structure
didn't approach us.  He just turned around and headed back the way he came.  I knew he'd return.  One of my 
partners was out collecting cobblestone when I spotted the same player wandering the coastline again abount 20
minutes later.  He was wearing armor this time and digging up a lot of dirt.  I assumed that the dirt was to build
straight up and infiltrate our base.  This could not happen.

     My partner was near him and hadn't been seen.  I could see everything from my lookout tower like a perched
eagle ready to strike.  My partner was going to attack before being seen but had no supplies.  (We are paranoid 
and don't leave the base with anything we don't need).  I called him near and was able to throw him down my 
sword from the highest point possible for building on Minecraft360.  He retrieves it and slays this man who was 
still digging around in the dirt.  My friend returned to the base with Iron armor and 64 Iron ore.  We knew he'd be
back

     It was literally the next in-game morning that him and another player came strolling up to investigate the 
island under our base.  We jumped down to make our kill and both players started to flee on boats.  We quickly 
made boats and started chasing them.  My partner caught his suspect quick and killed him while mine was still a
ways ahead of me.  I fired 2 arrows at him
boat out from under him.  Now my partner and I circled him in our boats like sharks.  We tried herding him to land
for a bit but lost interest.  I jumped off my boat and attacked him in the ocean.  Swimming to the bottom to 
collect my loot.  Our base still yet to be contested.

     Today I started up the server and saw that Bubsy had joined.  I thought
moved bases yet.  It would be funny to go leave signs around the old base that were noted to him when he 
comes to attack us again.""  I made four signs and headed off on my boat.  When I got there I saw a dog sitting 
in our main room.  ""Did you leave a dog behind when we moved?""  I ask my girlfriend.  It was then that Bubsy
came down the stairs and killed me!  Had he taken over our old base?

     Later while exploring
big haul

     Eventually I made it back to the original spawn area and saw that it had been blown to hell by creepers.  I 
loaded in creative and built a nice bedrock ""New player hut"" and a farm to get people started with food.  I also 
took the opportunity to hide some treasure in some fun ways around the map.  A sphinx in the desert filled with
treasure
map filled with bones

     The battle rages with the enemies we've gained but most people keep coming back and seem to play as often
as I do!(which is almost constantly).  and Bubsy even messaged me to tell me he found 2 treasures.  He must be
having as much
we are hunting the more established players and having a great time defending our skybase....which has yet to 
be breached!

The xbox will run constantly except for maintenance. It will be running survival mode and is open to everyone. The first week will be played on easy followed by a week of normal and then a hard for the rest of the time it is up. I am thinking every 3 months we can change the seed but that’s up in the air at the moment.


My GT is minecrafth0st due to the high demand I won't be manually sending friend requests from this point on. However I will be accepting all friend requests sent from here on out until my friends list is full. Feel free to send me a friend request. This is also the party you should join when you enter the game.

Also I am sure most of you know this but there can only be 8 people in the game at one time. If the game appears offline its not. 

We will be making a PVP arena In the near future on the map. Until then please don't kill other players. If you are caught you will be kicked

(note the capitalization)

Summary: This map is made up of close to 50/50 water to land split, a nice mix of the good stuff!

Here's a grid style breakdown. Imagine the map split into 9 squares, thus:

    1 2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 9

Think of squares 1, and 5 as sea, surrounded on  the right and bottom by land...

1. Almost entirely sea with one small island &amp; Tree.
2. Mostly sea with a few medium chain islands.
3. Mostly very tall mountains
4. Mostly sea with a medium mushroom biome island.
5. Mostly sea with another medium mushroom biome island
6. Mostly land
7. Very large island with medium to gently rolling hills and flat area. Contains a village.
8. 50/50 land water with land being mostly swamp and a little snow biome
9. Mostly land with almost all snow forest.

Hope you like it!

I've since fixed up the four villages: replaced gravel for cobblestone for the roads (connecting the two sister cities), even building a train to connect the villages north and south.

The four villages are named New Dunlap, and Wells Hollow. Ravine is aptly named because it sits atop a very large ravine. One villager's house actually has a basement that opens into the ravine. Wells Hollow is named because it sits atop a large cave system so the ground underneath many of the houses are hollow. Portsmouth is a seaside village and I built a dock for boats. New Dunlap is the biggest village so far and is a bustling metropolis.

I have read countless ""1000 Things to Do in Minecraft"" but they all devolve into madness relatively soon. I was inspired by the To-Do Board that /u/AdventLife posted and so I have decided to start a list.

Please feel free to add suggestions in the comments and I will add them to this list as things for me to strive to accomplish as well as a resource for others.

**To-Do List:**

- Giant Tree (treehouse optional)
- Open
- Mine (grip
- Mob Grinder (Cave spider
- Nether Portal
- Netherbase including Netherwart farm
- Livestock farm (cows
- Produce farm (wheat, sugarcane, and cacti)
- Crafting Center (furnace, brewing stations)
- Redstone testing center (so much more useful than I would have once thought)
- Well decorated base
- Another base for no apparent reason
- Storage center
- Easy and safe access to the End portal
- Slay the Enderdragon
- Build a shrine to the dragon egg
- Garden
- Minecart hub with rail system
- Automation of things (this could be as simple as standing on a pressure plate to collect sugarcane (not TRULY automatic but close enough for our purposes until 360 gets hoppers))
- Series of docks for easy transit since 360 maps are surrounded by water
- Collection of well enchanted gear
- Castle perhaps
- Pyramid
- Town or City (Could be an expansion of a Testificate Village)
- Hidden storage for valuables such as diamonds
- XP Grinder (Blaze if you can because each Blaze gives 10 XP as opposed to the usual 5 for a hostile mob but Cave Spiders can bve effective due to the possibility of finding multiple spawners in usable proximity)
- Renevated Stronghold (This is a long process if you have a large Stronghold and the Silverfish are a pain but I have set up a nice base there and it becomes rather cozy.) 
- Rooster Teeth Tower of Pimps?
- Stadium for Your Favorite Sport
- Upgraded NPC Village (Fortify with walls and turrets, improve farming, improve paths, add market, etc.)
- Underwater Base
- Insane Redstone Contraptions (/u/UsefulStatement suggested checking out Etho's Pet Project Wilson (Episode 248+))
- Statues
- Self-Sustaining Base (as much as possible)
- Gold Farm
- Iron Farm
- Theme Park (roller coasters are a must)
- Library (better if editable books come out)
- Arena for PvP
- Arena for fighting mobs
- Towers
- Sorted storage area

So I tried Minecraft on the PC long ago and never played it more than a few minutes.  Tried the demo on the 360 and thought I might buy it on sale.  I just never gave it the time.  Then it came out on disc and I grabbed it.  I've been playing ever since.  And this was my first map (still playing it but have tried a couple others I've seen posted).

It has a good variety of biomes, and a multi level dungeon with end portal and library.  There is also a mushroom island that sits off the coast.  I haven't used the portal yet because I just recently went back and realized what it was.

Seed: -4859394434384669128

(I have mapped some things out but lost a few entries due to my stupid iPad taking a dump so I switched to One Note on my Surface.  Really only lost a few diamond entries.)

You spawn close to:
-18

I built a temporary home here and started digging.  What I fell into soon after I had no idea existed.  

Dungeon:
7

Be careful here because I got lucky falling in at this point.  There is a wall that separates you from a very deep ravine.  So it's a bonus once you navigate to the bottom.  Multi level, spider spawner.  I had hell getting out only having played an hour or so.  So imagine a virgin miner falling into this darkness right away.

Zombies: 
-53

I built my home not far from here into the side of the cliff before I found this.  See the map picture for location.  There is a small village that can be seen from here that had seeds in a chest.  (if the seeds aren't there

The second village is near the north west corner just north of where the snow ends.  You will also find a large ravine

There is a lone island in the south east corner that is all mushroom and mooshroom.

The rest is diamond entries I've saved.  If you find anything else good

So - i ran some (not very comprehensive) tests on a superflat world - no structures.

***

First: i managed to spawn 90 sheep. - had to clear the area like 5 times to remove all natural spawns... but i ended up with 90 sheep.

switched to chickens - spawned 19 - mob limit msg.

switched to wolves - spawned 26 - mob limit msg.

switched to mooshrooms - spawned 10 - mob limit msg.

switched to villagers - spawned 20 - mob limit msg.

so

***

checked the area - no natural spawns

killed the mooshrooms and tried to spawn cows - 0.

checked the area - no natural spawns

killed the wolves and tried cows - 0.

checked the area - no natural spawns

killed the villagers and tried cows - 0.

checked the area - no natural spawns

killed the chickens and tried cows - 0.

check the area - no natural spawns

killed 10 sheep - tried cows - got 10.

***

i continued to kill sheep in tens and spawned cows in tens and the limit seemed to stay at 90 as it would only let me spawn the same number as i killed... checked the area 1 last time - 10 chickens spawned naturally somewhere along the line that i must have missed.

so

has anyone else tried something similar to verify / disprove these findings?

edit: i also went to the furthest point away from my inhumane mob farm and tried to spawn more after getting the limit message - NOPE. so it's a global limit not based on what's in the vicinity.",self,t5_2tjtf,1366059648.0,,slime,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft360/comments/1ceit9/passive_mob_limit_observations/
