1350517372.0,11nqmo,Should I trust my girlfriend at this point? ,ireallyneedhelpn,112,21,127,"Hey reddit

The problem is she is suicidal. Or at least was

She often gets depressed and says things like ""You don't love me"" and ""Everyone would be better if I was dead"" She hates her body even though shes too skinny for her own good (read: 20lbs underweight). 

Yesterday she sent me a text telling me that she tried to drown herself

Then out of nowhere she said ""I love you. Never forget that. It will get better

then ""Be strong for me""

and ""Can I ask you something? Can you pray for me or something?""

All the while I'm saying things like ""Babe please stop. Im worried""

while shes saying ""You dont need to worry

This morning she texted me saying ""I'm at school




I honestly feel like her and this guy planned on killing themselves that night


**I think its about time I updated this!**

* It turns out 99% (if not everything) my now ex GF has ever told me was actually a lie. She has never hurt herself save a few incidents years ago. This other guy does not even exist. Her mother is not abusive in the slightest (I was told this) And her attempts of suicide were a lie. She told me she was sexually abused. This was not true. She called and told me that she took a lot of pills and I called 911, thankfully it never spread. Her friends occasionally text me asking if I like [insert random girls name here] and they meditatively start talking shit about her like this:


Rach: Hey do you like Katya?

Me: Not particularly

Rach: Because she was spreading shit about X saying she was so ugly


At this point I told her to fuck off because Katya is the most mature girl I know

 
* Recently My ex told me she would be in the hospital for Christmas break and she was really sad


* All in all I know im changed for the better and feel like this was a nessisary part in my life


**Thanks for all the support reddit, because she has helped me every step of the way and I honestly do think I would a) be in a much worse position and b) require therapy if not for her. Thank you so much raisedaslave!** Hope you like what i sent you for Christmas!

1333843218.0,ryji4,My workout,,95,54,41,"Okay, I just kind of go with it. It also depends on how much time I have and whether I'm focusing on a certain body area

**Running:** I cannot stress enough how important it is to have running as part of your routine. Not only does it help you tone, or going 20 mins your first day, then 30, etc. I would recommend running outside rather than on a treadmill, too...you get to enjoy the scenery, take new routes, it burns more calories

**Lifting:** I'm just going to be honest...I have not been to the gym in several months and have never regularly attended. I used to bench press and do bar squats all the time, laterals, and push press. Don't forget tricep extensions! I work out my legs with dumbbells with lunges (back/forth) and dumbbell squats. 

**Abs:** Many people have recommended P90X to me, and I've simply never planned my workout routines before. Anyway, some of my ab exercises are pick-pockets (sit on your bottom with knees bent and feet up, and move your hands from hip to hip), leg lifts, reverse toe touch, suitcases, and, you are simply using the weight to help lift yourself up haha.

**Other:** Push ups and pull ups are also key. Don't forget about the different variations though...warm up with wide push ups, pull ups might take awhile; don't be discouraged! To help get your first few, ask someone to help spot you, or start out using the flexed arm hang. Let's seeeee what else...I am also a part-time lifeguard, so I swim some laps during the summer. Also full body and long distance, but a surprisingly different work out than running. It's a lot harder for me.

1367858129.0,1dsth5,10 Easy Steps for Being Awesome,tedwinkworth,38,6,5,"It’s officially Graduation time. Many of you are getting a fancy piece of paper soon. If your school is awesome it will say “Level up: Life Skill AWESOME acquired”. For most of you it will just say your name and some words in Latin. Sucks to suck.

When I was an undergrad I remember looking forward to graduation so much. I thought to myself on a regular basis

At least real life had started. And I was off to the races… Not really. I had to move back in with my mom because I hadn’t made any job plans and didn’t feel motivated to sign up for 2 more years of college. I basically spent a year screwing off before deciding I needed a Master’s Degree. With that degree I eventually ended up working at a college. Now

In the last 4 years I’ve met people who are in their early 20s who I consider peers and equals; people who organize groups

There are some of you who might be wondering what the value of your education is. You still might be in school. You still might be trying to figure out what it is you’re going to do with your life. I learned a lot about that these last 4 years. I noticed that everyone who was kicking ass had a few things in common and as I get ready to leave and attempt to spread the gospel of “Be Awesome” I’d like to share what I saw in them as a doctrine for excellence.

And so I give you the 10 commandments of Being Awesome:

1) Be a dork.
A person who confidently and assertively loves dungeons and dragons is always cooler (and somehow more attractive to the opposite sex) than a person who wears a snapback and gets hammered for the sake of trying to look cool. It’s been amazing for me to realize that some of the most confident and respectable people are


 
2) Say YES to new things.
This was my single biggest failing as an undergrad. I didn’t join clubs because I didn’t want to feel like the new kid/outsider. I didn’t want to dance because I might look silly. I turned down hundreds of opportunities to do what was comfortable and ended up missing the boat entirely. If you’re going to be excellent you have to know who you are and what you offer. If you want to know who you are and what you offer


 
3) Don’t take criticism personally
EVERYONE who I saw accomplish something big these last 4 years was told in the beginning that what they wanted to do was not possible. In every situation I saw whoever was about to do something great say “fuck the haters. I’m doing it anyway” and then proceed to create something unbelievable. When someone says something is impossible


 
4) Embrace Failure.
For every good idea there are 10 bad ones. The key is to let bad ideas go and focus on the positives you’ve built. It’s cliche to say but failures aren’t people who fail. Failures are people who fail and feel sorry for themselves instead of going back to the drawing board with the lessons they’ve learned. Every awesome person I’ve met here has failed numerous times. The interesting thing is you’d never know it. Instead of whining about it on twitter

 

5)Drink less.
And smoke less weed. Sure you have to be social and casual beers are a way to get there. I’ll admit that many of the cool things that I’ve done here in the last few years were dreamed up over beers and bullshit. I’ll even concede that going out and getting hammered once in a blue moon is your right as an American. However


 
6) Give everyone a chance.
I always had a hard time with this because I always wanted to be seen with the “cool” kids in hopes of grabbing some of their status. I noticed something interesting about the people I consider to be excellent – they hang out with everyone. They have the oddest friends and they love them all. This gives them access to all sorts of strange worlds and social circles. Best friends come from strange and unexpected places so try not to judge anyone before you get to know them. This has a cool side effect too – when you try to see the positives in other people instead of judging them harshly


 
7) Stop listening to grownups.
At some point you know more about you than your parents do. Embrace that fact. Run with it. Listen, let’s face it, you’ve done that thing a lot and their meddling has saved your fragile ignorant life. At some point, though,  you become a grown up. That means that your decisions are actually worth pursuing. No one can tell you when that is. You just have to know. Don’t wait for a diploma or a job or a wife to prove to yourself that you’re capable of making decisions. My guess is that if you’re interested enough in this to be reading this far, you’re already there. Now go do something.

 

8)Help others instead of yourself.
This will be impossible until you get a handle on Number 6. Helping people does a lot. First, it puts value into the “community fund” which I’ll define as: People feeling good and connected. The value of that community fund is directly proportional to how easy it will be for you to be picked up on days when you feel like you’re out of gas. When you help yourself you’re only getting the first thing and the other 2 go untouched. As long as you can let other people help you, this is a much more sound investment. I do have to note that SO MANY people fuck this up. They call it karma or tit for tat and they want a reward for their good deed immediately. If you expect that, the thing doesn’t work because you’re not really helping someone else, you’re just trying to help yourself.


 
9) Don’t stop learning.
Most people stop learning around their sophomore year. Boredom has set in. They’re interested in grades and credits. If this is you, or better yet, going on a service trip. Learning has little to do with sitting in a classroom being talked at. I learned more in the last 4 years than I did in 6 years of higher education and I didn’t go to a single class except for when I was giving a lecture or playing pranks on Dr. Burch’s Human Sexuality Class. I learned all of it by meeting people who were interested in different things or collaborating on projects. The most engaged people I’ve met here were students who had side-hustles. They were using the school’s money to fund ski trips or climbing trips. They used the design labs to cook up their projects. They used the recording studio to record their band’s record. Oh and EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM TRAVELED. College is a great place to get acquainted with the world through travel. Every awesome person I know utilized that opportunity. I firmly believe that if you don’t, you are wasting your time and money.


 
10) Life Starts Today
Above all else

 


This stuff is easy. Being awesome doesn’t depend on your parents, “Fuck it, from now I’m gonna be awesome.” then you’ll be on your way to kicking ass in no time. I can actually guarantee that.



Your first order of business? Start with #8 and share this with your friends. You’ll be helping me a lot. Thanks!

 

With love

Any advice would be appreciated. ",dontknowwhattodohelp,27,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/xm2l1/my_little_sister_is_4_years_younger_than_i_am_she/
EDIT: Executive summary: Little sister accusing me of molesting her. I'm innocent. Help.

Dear /r/advice

I come from a family of 5. I'm the middle child, and the younger one Meredith. My parents are Bill and Mary, and are both wonderful. There was no abuse, physically or otherwise, in my family that I know of. My dad never hit me or anything like that.

I'm 24, worked odd jobs, met a couple special women, almost got married. All in all, I was pretty happy. Two years ago my health started declining rapidly. Cancer, some other fun crap. Finally, I had to have knee reconstructive surgery, move home, and this would mean I'd get to spend more time with my grandfather

My younger sister still lives at home, from the time she was in 8 until she was 13 or 14. She demanded a lock on her door (not just a lock, a dead bolt), and asked my parents not to allow me to return home. They let me move back in anyway.

First off, I've never intimidated her. She hasn't provided any details on what she's accusing me of, at least that have been shared with me.

I thought, we were close. About 5 years ago, her attitude towards everything and everyone changed. She, according to her own admissions, hates everyone in the family except my dad. I tried to be nice, and supportive, as big brothers should be, like her computer fixed, but I did get her some weed for a birthday present once), and was very nice to me for a while. Once I told her she couldn't have it

Before I moved out, and I had a TV in my room. We used to talk about things she couldn't ask my mom and dad. Does there need to be a condom involved if its just a blow job? I knew when she lost her virginity, and I drove her to planned parenthood the first time to get tested for an STD. I drove her home from parties and snuck her in the back door so my parents wouldn't know she drank. I thought I was a good big brother.  I was trying to be her friend, while still making sure she didn't do anything horrendously stupid.  I was letting her live, and make her own mistakes, while being there and providing something of a safety net. I know some of you would treat your younger siblings differently, but that's not what this is about. 

I always knocked before entering her room, we stopped wrestling on the trampoline when we were kids because it felt weird for me (this is when we were like 4 and 8). I always made sure to respect her, because she was my little sister and I loved her.

I lived two states away for a while, and was living with my long term girlfriend (her and I broke up six to eight months later). Meredith begged my parents to buy her a train ticket to come visit me. She stayed for two weeks, and then asked if she could move in. At that point, I probably would have let her, but my parents didn't like the idea (something about having to switch schools and missing AP classes or some such nonsense), so I said no. Why would she try to move in with me if I had been molesting her?

A few other...red flags (?) that have come up. My dad discovered that Meredith has been ""borrowing"" his narcotic pain killers, and have been fighting some dependency issues. She's also been pushing for my parents to pay for her to get her own apartment for a little while. This would be more incentive for my parent's or something, I guess. My parents have money, and are relatively comfortable, but they certainly don't have the money to pay for her apartment/ life. She's also been begging my parents to let her adopt a puppy, and let it live in the house (all our dogs are outdoor only). She brought that up as ""protection"" against me. I think she wants something, and is willing to burn my family to the ground to get it.

I dont know if she was really ever molested, obviously. If this is just a ploy to get an apartment and a dog, I'm done with her. She would no longer be my sister.

My parents are fighting, turning it into a daily thing.  I'm not eating, or sleeping (so far I've lost 15 pounds in six days).  My family is falling apart.  Part of me just wants to sell everything I own, buy a thin and light laptop, and a plane ticket to anywhere and just run.  If I didn't have a girlfriend, I'd probably already have done it.  

I'm still collecting my thoughts, help me.

And please, without editing, and haven't reread it. I just need to get my thoughts out. And yes, this is a throwaway.

1358195809.0,16kkgb,"Was drinking at a bar, came to at sunrise while boarding a bus, with a heparin lock in my arm and EKG leads on my chest, and a face like a prize-fighter's. Need advice on how to find out what happened and where to go from here.",yoobnoom,5

**Friday, and I saw a girl drinking from a ridiculous tin cup with some sort of strange garnish, so I teased her about her drink. She called me a jerk, so I ordered her one of what I was having. We talked for a minute or so, while our identical drinks were sitting on the bar, with both of us reaching through the crowd around the bar for them to take a drink. I mention this, because one theory I have is that someone was trying to slip her something and got my glass instead. Talking to her, is the absolute last thing I recall.

**Saturday

The hospital records list my chief complaint as Assault, but I denied being kicked in the face. The DO states ""this is just what the EMS was told"". The report also states I was clinically sober.

The MD's report says that I claimed to be drinking at a different bar than I remember being at (however

The Triage report contradicts some things from the other two reports

**Saturday

**Saturday, walk into a store for a pack of cigarettes, and the clerk won't look me in the face and rushes me out. I sit down on the curb, and realize there's something in my arm, and pull my jacket and sweater away to find the heparin needle still inserted and taped to my inner arm. I am dressed exactly as I was at the beginning of the night, and my clothes aren't cut away. I don't have a hospital bracelet on my arm of ankle. My wallet, keys and phone are on me

**Saturday, and I realize now that my face is a bloody swollen mess that frightened the convenience store clerk, I decide to drive two hours back to the town where I live.

**Saturday, and decided to leave for another bar, figuring I'd call them to meet up later. One coworker suggests I'd been slipped a mickey. After getting undressed I notice the EKG leads still attached to my body.

**Saturday, and get a CAT scan and drug screen. Neither tests shows anything, although the physician explains that they can only screen for standard street drugs like pot, cocaine, PCP, etc., and most date rape drugs are something only the police can test for. A police officer talks to me

**Monday, I decide to make a report to the police. They say there isn't much they can do, although drink tampering has been happening in that town very often very recently. Without a suspect or any information, he couldn't start an investigation, but had me fill out a report online.

I also talked to the owner of the bar I last recall being at. He was very apologetic, or saw anything out of the ordinary, but it was a very busy night.

**Monday

Here are my concerns and lingering questions:

- There is nothing in the medical records or ambulance bill about an EKG test. Why were there leads on my body? Someone has suggested that because I was picked up in the Country Jail parking lot with very limited information given to the EMS, but was found to be clinically sober, and they did the test on the Down Low to cover their asses. This seems possible but really unlikely, and I'm trying not to jump to conclusions because my memory of the night is nil, and I don't want to fill my head with suggestive stories just to fill in the blank.

- At the second hospital I checked myself into, the bill I received from the hospital stay I don't recall is a huge burden, and I have no insurance. How could I apply for assistance with that hospital? Do I have enough information to apply for victim's assistance, without really being sure exactly how I ended up beat up and out of it with no recollection?

- What are some explanations for my lack of memory beyond being drugged? If I was assaulted

- There are some, and I'm not sure how much I'm just filling in. I remember the EMS and police officers standing over me, and talking about their comedy improv group. I remember walking quickly up and down the sidewalk at night, and at one point the sidewalk angling like a wall I had to walk sideways on. I remember walking by cars in a parking lot and setting off a car alarm. But all these things seem like a dream, and I don't know how much I'm just supplying in hindsight.

I am trying to piece together a puzzle in which the pieces all have mutable shapes. Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated.

[Edited for readability]

*Update*

I visited the EMS station, in the parking lot of the jail. The police found me wandering the streets, smelled alcohol on my breath, and asked me what I was doing. I said I was, according to the official report, ""thinking about a girl"".

When I was quite small, my mom would include me in a number of activities which even at a young age made me feel very uncomfortable and upset:

1) Every night until about 8th grade, and the inspection could sometimes last 5 or more minutes (not just a quick going over), and would most often involve examining my genitals, and running her hands over my body, including touching my genitals on the outside.

Occasionally also, and make comment about how nicely my ""boobies"" were growing in.

I have no way of knowing her true motives in doing this to me, and it's always been my opinion that even if she didn't consciously intend any of this in a sexual way, it crossed the lines of decency and respecting personal space, especially as I got older.

2) Until I was about the same age (12 or 13) my whole family would sleep in one bed, but my mom would specifically request that I slept with her (undressed) and would become resentful if I tried to sleep somewhere else.

Years later, regardless of intent, was some pretty poor phrasing on her part.

3) Around the time I started highschool and hit puberty, all of whom were also 14 or 15 years old.)

She forbade me from wearing a bra all throughout highschool

She gave sexualized ""compliments"" to my best friend, and would make remarks, too, about just random children on the street, such as saying they were ""developing nicely.""

4) More recently (up until now

a) Several months ago, but found my mom masturbating and mostly unclothed. When I tried to leave she asked me to stay because she wanted to talk to me.

b) When my current boyfriend first started coming to our house, sometimes in front of him, if he'd ever had sex with any of his previous girlfriends/boyfriends.

Naturally, especially since to some extent the insanity continues. However, I work on and off at low paying jobs and don't have a lot of savings, so I can't move out, especially since I'm 19, still in college, and not particularly qualified for anything.

It stresses me out pretty severely to live here still, it's nowhere fucking near the situation I'd like to be in right now, and any ideas are appreciated. I don't know a lot about the laws surrounding things like this where I live (NYS) and I haven't even given a lot of thought to if any laws were broken or if I'd like to pursue legal action where possible, but there you have it, so

comments? advice? thanks.


**Edit:** Forgot to mention that my school is a 2-year community college with no on -campus housing

**Edit again:** I also wanted to mention that yes my mom does have the tendency to consistently sexualize children. She is highly religious (Catholic), her talks often center on ""chastity""/abstinence and quickly descend into scrutinizing the bodies and sexual practices of small kids and underage teenagers, but, sanctioned by the religious officials at her church because it's in their Sunday school curriculum, and by the other highly religious adults around her, this doesn't raise a red flag because it's a common way of thinking in their particular circle.

Other people have been cautioning me not to bring future offspring around my mom. This is definitely excellent advice for someone with children,"" giving her gifts and hugs, which I'm loath to interpret as entirely innocent). Since most of the children she interacts with are the kids of her religiously like-minded adult friends, I would have no idea how to address something like this with them, since much of the behavior I see as inappropriate, they're willing to dismiss because they've known her for so long, or are also used to casually sexualizing children in lesser ways.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/19jmbp/a_little_bit_molested/

1348522545.0,10ewf9,"Never fail at conversations, job interviews, or life again!",smurge,25,20, or how to keep a conversation going? Maybe you we're on a date or a job interview and you're not sure what to do or where to go with your conversation. Well there is no need to worry anymore because following these simple steps will improve any conversation you have with anyone!


Some basic rules:

Rule #1 : People love to talk about themselves. They love to talk about how great they are, etc. Always appeal to peoples ego's!

Rule #2 : Establish a common ground!  When you have something in common with another person it will always make the conversations so much easier. The reason is

Rule #3 : When they share a story with you 

Rule #4 : Do 75% listening and 25% of the talking! The reason for this is it shows you are listening to that person and respect their time. Also


So now that we have some basics rules down let's get started!


Step 1:  Open Ended Questions

So you may be asking yourself. ""How do I start a conversation with people?"" or ""What do I need to say to get this person to like me?""

First let's start with my friends:

Who, When, Why, How!

Starting any conversation or question with these will result in what's called an "" OPEN ENDED QUESTION"". Notice that if you start with one of these type of questions it requires a person to give a detailed response. A simple yes or no won't suffice. 



Step 2: Close Ended Questions

The only time you use these is to get a definitive answer from someone (YES or NO).  Typically they start off a sentence with:

Do, May I, Have, Is, Shall ,Does! 


Once again these are used to get yes or no responses or to clarify what the other person is saying.

Step 3:  Rapport Building

This is not “RAPTOR BUILDING” it is “Rapport Building”. This means you find out something interesting about the person and you share a similar or common story. This will allow you to have a common ground with this person and relax both parties which will allow you to enjoy your time together. 

Dani Johnson has a tremendous method to rapport building. It's called  F.O.R.M.  If you remember this you will never fail to start a conversation or have anything to talk about.  So what does F.O.R.M. Mean?  

Ask questions to the person about the following areas of their lives:

Family / Friends 
Occupation / Organizations
Recreation (what they like to do for fun
Message  ( share a story or common experience with them )


Step 4: Tell me more!

This step is one of the most helpful tools I can offer to you.   When someone says something important and you want more information about it simply say the following:  

“ TELL ME MORE ABOUT THAT” or  “ WHEN YOU SAY ( INSERT WHAT THEY SAID)


By doing this it keeps the person talking and you are in the drivers seat. 


So now that we have the basics covered let's look at some examples!




Example #1 On a date: 

Scenario: Scumbag Steve set's you up on a blind date. You arrive to find out that he set you up with the hottest person in the world, and panic set's in! What do you do? You remember your 6 friends, W,W,W,W,W

Example:

You:

So, Steve has told me a lot about you! HOW, is you're day going so far?

Date:

It's going great!

You: 

Really? Tell me more about that!

Date:

Well


You:

I was nervous about meeting you too so don't worry. I have had bad experiences as well. You never know who you are going to meet these days. 

Date:

Yeah

You:

So you said you went shopping and has a blast

Date:

(person rambles on – then the stories over  and for some reason you missed the last 5 minutes of the conversation because you sneezed and were nervous about having a stage 4 cliff hanger)

WHAT DO YOU DO NOW?   (Hint: REMEMBER F.O.R.M)


You: Wow sounds like you had  a lot of fun. So tell me


/ END EXAMPLE







Job Interview:

Remember on a job interview the goal is to get them to like you. If they like you it doesn’t matter what your skill set is. Don't believe me? Think about it, etc? It's because he is “LIKED” by the person who hired him. His friend is the hiring manager, etc. The bottom line is people want to hire people who they like. Not necessarily who has the best set of skills. They want to hire someone they like because they know they can trust them or feel they can do the job without having to be told a million times because you are friends. So bottom line, when you are in a job interview you need to do a core set of things:


Basic Rules:

#1. Establish Common ground with the interviewer. When you walk into their office look around for a moment. Look for the following items, school, or something they have won with the company. Look for unique items, painting, etc.

The reason why is you are going to use that item right away to break the ICE and get the interviewer to like you. How is that possible? It goes back to RULE #1 at the very top ! Get people to talk about themselves and they will like you. 

So find that item in the interview room and get the person to talk about it.  Once they start talking about it it's time to sneak in a few of the FORM questions.  

#2. When they start asking you about why you would qualify for the position it's time to flip the script on them and ask them the questions. Here's why!

Example:  

Interviewer:  “Tell me why you would be a good fit for this company?”

You: “That's a great question! I would be a good fit because (list a few thing about your backround). Let me ask you (Interviewer name)

Interviewer: ( Lists off problems)

You: (Repeat back what you heard) Tell me more about that? 


/end 

What you just did was ask the person to tell you what the biggest problem is they are facing and now your responses will be centered around solving the biggest problem they have! If they see you can solve the problems because your responses are directed toward their issues you will get the job over a qualified person.




I hope this helps you all and hope to bring a ton of information to you in the near future!

I suppose I always had suspicions of them doing something while I was working, I like zebra print, my son likes panda print) while my son was out of town to spend Christmas with his biological mother.  That's when I first suspected something.  Upon asking her why she bought that when she knew it wasn't the kind I like, she responded with, ""When does M23 get home?""  I told her he would be back by New Years to spend New Years with us and she dropped the subject.

I recieved a text from my son shortly before New Years to say he was going to stay with his mother for New Years.  A little disappointed, that we could celebrate New Years when he got back.  He said that was fine and asked how F50 was doing.  I said she was missing him and we were looking forward to having him back again.

On January 3rd, your cat is gone into hiding, I'll get him for you.""  Thinking he was just missing his cat.  When I brought his cat to him, he put the cat into the carrier.  I asked him why he was doing that and he responded with, ""Because I can.""  I said, ""No, really M23, ""Nothing against you

Needless to say, alright.  You don't have a job, so where are you staying?""  He said, ""I found a place and F50 said she'll pay for it.""  

I turned to my wife at the time and asked her what the hell was going on.  She said she was leaving me for M23

I'm not an abusive man, and request that my wife at least have food on the table when I get home from work and then rant and rave when I would return home only to find both her and my son have been on the computer all day and the sink was filled with dishes, no housework done, and no food made, hell, even a pack of ramen would have kept me happy, but I didn't even get that.

Another shock to me was all these years of my son growing up, I didn't like his boyfriend and everyone knew it, but not because he was a man, it was because I would see my son buying that guy everything he wanted and my son never even got a thank-you in return.  Plus that guy would leave my son anytime my son didn't have any money and I would be there to pick up the pieces, only to have this guy magically appear in my son's life again when he got some money.  So my son doing this to me was very painful.  A deep soul kind of pain.

It has been 6 months (almost 7) since this happened and a few weeks ago, I don't like him for what he did, but I still love him.  So I welcomed him back in my life with opened arms.  It opened a few wounds that had healed since the incident, but I was willing to work through it.  While talking with my son, I found out that he was still with my ex-wife (I applied for a divorce shortly after they left), and that they were living with some of her family after losing the apartment.  I told my son he was welcome back into my home but she was never to step foot on my property again.  At first, he seemed okay with the idea (trouble in paradise, but out of nowhere, my heart was broken.

A few days ago, she was more my ex-wife's friend, but I didn't have a problem with her and I enjoyed her company.  I asked her how she was doing and she gave me this look like I had a turd on my lip before leaving, saying I would never get in her pants, that my ex-wife warned her about me.

In September

Reddit, I thought we were.  If I can't be in his life again, I want to at least be able to heal.  I don't enjoy the club scene, I'm too old for that.  I tried going out and getting exercise and meeting people, but after 20 years of my life revolving around 2 people, I'm so socially awkward, it's painful to watch.  Does anyone have any ideas in what I can do to at least find a purpose to live again?

Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. Oh, you’ll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can’t grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You are not as fat as you imagine.

Don’t worry about the future. Or worry

Do one thing every day that scares you.

Sing.

Don’t be reckless with other people’s hearts. Don’t put up with people who are reckless with yours.

Floss.

Don’t waste your time on jealousy. Sometimes you’re ahead, it’s only with yourself.

Remember compliments you receive. Forget the insults. If you succeed in doing this

Keep your old love letters. Throw away your old bank statements.

Stretch.

Don’t feel guilty if you don’t know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn’t know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don’t.

Get plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees. You’ll miss them when they’re gone.

Maybe you’ll marry, maybe you’ll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary. Whatever you do, don’t congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself either. Your choices are half chance. So are everybody else’s.

Enjoy your body. Use it every way you can. Don’t be afraid of it or of what other people think of it. It’s the greatest instrument you’ll ever own.

Dance

Read the directions

Do not read beauty magazines. They will only make you feel ugly.

Get to know your parents. You never know when they’ll be gone for good. Be nice to your siblings. They’re your best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.

Understand that friends come and go, the more you need the people who knew you when you were young.

Live in New York City once

Travel.

Accept certain inalienable truths: Prices will rise. Politicians will philander. You, you’ll fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.

Respect your elders.

Don’t expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund. Maybe you’ll have a wealthy spouse. But you never know when either one might run out.

Don’t mess too much with your hair or by the time you’re 40 it will look 85.

Be careful whose advice you buy, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it’s worth.
But trust me on the sunscreen.""

In a nutshell, where he and his siblings without remorse presented straight up fiction about me.   I didn't do anything of the sort.  Judge saw through it though.

He is progressively become obsessive and controlling with phone calls/texts - maybe 2 -6 a day?   needing to talk to the children.  neither talk - it's just to make him feel better and assert control over the kids.  ends with the autistic child freaking out because he has no sense of time.

He has always had anger issues, he replaced it with not exposing his emotions at all. We never know what he's up to. We never know how he feels. He tells us stories, which we don't understand, but he never understands why we don't get what he means, this frustrates him. Then he gets angry. We try to understand but he talks such about such random out of the blue subjects. We don't understand what he's saying and why.

He's also incredibly selfish. But we get the idea that he just doesn't realize there are other people in the world than himself. He will never do something for you, one knife, one fork, one cup, just for him.

Also, as if he's been up to something.
Thirdly, change into regular clothes, shower, go outside, play with friends, comb his hair. He would just sit in a chair and do nothing. When you tell him to do something, mostly

He is very smart, because he was daydreaming, or at least that is what we think.

You can send him upstairs to get ready for bed, he can't watch tv for 2 days, but he won't care. He doesn't realize. The next day he'll only get mad at you because he can't watch tv. It also seems like he doesn't learn. If he is used to putting his bike in the left half of the garage when he gets home, you can tell him every day, every hour, to put it on the right side. It causes no more effort or whatsoever, but he just won't do it. These are the little things that my super practical and perfectionist dad gets extremely angry about. He and my brother keep having the same fights over and over but my brother doesn't learn. This is frustrating for us all.

He's gone through several tests

Do any of you know what to do?

 My step brother who just turned 13 yesterday has been causing some problems but the one I'm most concerned about is his is what I can only describe as an obsession with porn. Now I know a lot of you are thinking for his age what kid doesn't try to see that, his methods of obtaining it, and what exactly he's looking up.

 First of all, it takes several pages worth of just links in his browsing history to find what all he looked at in a single day. So it started over a year ago when some friends told him how to look it up on the internet and he started using the family computer to look it up and was caught immediately, he was punished given a very long lecture but that didn't deter him even for a day so my dad and stepmom were forced to put locks on the computer but even that didn't stop him from trying to find something frequently.

 On his 12th birthday his mom had the ""brilliant"" idea of getting him his very own laptop with the intent of putting parental controls on it. It did not take long to discover that she didn't really know how to set up parental controls properly. Then when he started school and I was away for a while he would be home alone while my parents were at work and in a period of no more than 3 weeks he managed to rack up over 700 dollars worth of pay per view porn. No I am not exaggerating.  More issues with the laptop

 On the particular day he was ungrounded and got the laptop back

Well I had a long heart to heart talk with him about how I'm concerned with his behavior and what should be done to make better choices in his life. Parents do not take away laptop, this was back in late June.

 But here's where the fun begins, there were many, and I mean many searches for things involving rape. His parents were forced to have a different kind of talk with a 12 year old about rape and finally his laptop was removed.

 However, a nook, anything that had an internet access to find more porn. Also there was the occasional slip up of not logging off the computer thus giving him free range if we happen to leave the room for 5 fucking minutes. Last two times was my dad's mistake of not logging off in the past two weeks on multiple occasions. And making reappearance in his latest escapades was more rape content, as well as attempting to find child pornography, with that I don't think he realized the dangers of doing that but he was warned about it none the less. 

But since then he has been grounded, until today…

Today marks the biggest WTF moment yet, gets him his very own phone, it can't connect to the internet. However today he proceeds to text everyone he knows nonstop but the worst thing was he texted his female cousin who is already 13 and asked her to take some nude photos of herself and send them to him.  His aunt is now too scared to let her kids be anywhere near him. 

So there you have it, all the punishments be it loss of property or physical labor or simply being grounded, and all the restrictions put in place on anything that can be plugged in have had no effect whatsoever.

 If you have any suggestions please please please let me know. He's at the point where he doesn't even show remorse or guilt about what he has done anymore

  If I seem like I'm exaggerating it's simply because the number of times he has ignored the rules and done whatever he has felt like is abnormally high

 NOTE: I was away at college during the school year so I wasn't able to help with technical issues at that time.

1372084575.0,1gyxt3,My boyfriend is still in love with his ex ... in a platonic way ... but still.,inadequategirlfriend,18,5,32,"For obvious reasons, we live together



So, we have great sex, and he is honestly the greatest boyfriend. He is super supportive, patient, understanding, loving, etc. I hate that I even have a concern because he's so amazing. He is far too good for me. Herein lies the concern. He's way smarter than I am, and just better at life in general. We don't have anything to talk about! I don't understand what he does, I really like her



I did something that I promised myself I wouldn't do in this relationship, in and of itself, I don't mind, in fact I think it's great that they've managed to maintain their relationship post-breakup. What sucks is that he and I are nowhere near that level. And never will be. We're just not like that. They talk all the time, spend all day at work together, and just absolutely love each other. Recently he spent a fun night getting quite high and drunk, and in a text conversation with her told her that she was the love of his life. Now, or that he's bemoaning the fact that they're not together. I just hate that he will never feel toward me the way he feels about her. We'll never be that close.



I'm worried that I'm just filling in the puzzle of his life. I fit the wife-shaped hole. He knows he loves me and thinks I'll be a good mother



But, I really want that best friend closeness. I keep trying to nurture that, but our conversations don't go anywhere. I'm not interesting or witty enough to keep up. And I don't know what to do.



I know that if I just let go



TL;DR My boyfriend told his ex that she is the love of his life. I feel like a placeholder.



EDIT:

UPDATE:


Sorry for the delay, talking and eating, and I was really hesitant to spoil it with what I needed to talk about. But, eventually I brought it up, and he heard my concerns with a very open, patient and understanding ear. He assured me that my assumptions about his words being expansive and poorly chosen due to his inebriation and drug-induced euphoria were correct. But he did acknowledge that it was a very inappropriate thing to say. We agreed that it wasn't very thoughtful of them to use a nickname for me together that they did not also use with me. And he told me that he switches back and forth between using it and not using it (I understand that it would be very easy to slip into it when everyone around him is using it). He was very understanding of what prompted my snooping, and was ready to forgive me. We talked about how I had never done that before with him, and the next time I'm feeling anything similar I will instead talk to him about it right away. We are both interested in actively nurturing our friendship and closeness. He told me that he tries to not tell me too much about his work because he thinks it is boring for me. I told him that the opposite was true


I feel very good about everything. I think we each only have one not great feeling about everything. Mine is that I feel super shitty about the fact that I snooped, we agreed that everything will be ok, and we'll just both keep working at it.

But this is not about how they lack a green thumb. It's about how cruddy they are to animals.

They first had a puppy outside for a week or so on a really short leash in late March (It was still snowing). Week later

A little later, she would come over to my house and meow at the door. 

 Every single time we would take her back.  And every single time the wife would make up an excuse saying it was an accident she is outside or she thought coyotes got to her.  Even though this cat would sit on their lawn and they was a water dish for her on the porch. I was really worried about her safety because of construction

I'm going to take her to the vet later to see if she's okay and going to give her a bath.  Her legs are covered in mats, and looks absolutely miserable.  As much as I want to keep her, I am borderline crazy cat lady and have not enough space for another cat. I have some friends that are interested in taking her in.

I feel really conflicted. What I did was theft but I feel like I saved her life. She's an utterly beautiful and cute cat that sticks her tongue out. Really soft and luxurious where there are no mats and poo on her. My neighbors don't know what a beautiful cat they had that they would just carelessly throw out to the street.

1355632821.0,14xfh1,Worth a shot.,zwackooo,13,1,9,"I'm sure my story will go unnoticed but seeing how i haven't a single person to talk to

To start things off

When I started first grade I loved it... until I was abruptly pulled out of my class to join a combined class of first and second graders. The teacher only taught second grade lessons which was way above my level and I ended up failing the first grade because of it. My mother was so upset with my school that she ended up transferring me to another one. My mother tried her best to get me into the second grade but wasn't able to seeing how far behind I was. So there I stayed for the next 5 years. During that time though, hated him the instant we saw him.

As time went on at home, my mother became pregnant with my youngest brother. A couple years after he was born, he became a spitting image of my father and my father's prized possession. My father would tell him to hit us or pull our hair and he'd do it, my youngest brother being of course only 3 years old at the time he obviously didn't know better. My father would ask my youngest brother to do strange, disgusting things for him. My second brother and I were too afraid to say anything to anyone about anything. It was so horrible to watch. After struggling for 5 years in elementary school, I finally finished it and was excited to go to middle school with the very few friends I had. During summer break that year, my mother told my brothers and I that we were moving to Tampa because my father's job had relocated him there. Needless to say

After about 3 months of living in Tampa, it was hard to talk to anyone about anything, it was hard trying to relate to people and it was difficult for me to maintain eye-contact when having to talk to someone. So I ended up failing the sixth grade, failing the seventh grade and finally failing the eighth grade. After all of that I was pulled out of middle school by my mother and sent to a technical school once I turned 17. Same thing happened. My troubles kept me from doing what I had to do and so my grandparent's money was wasted. A year later I decided to try community college and of course, it happens again. I drop out of my prep courses.

I tell my mom and grandparents that I think I need to see a specialist. So we did and after a while was prescribed medicine. Unbeknownst to me, no car, no driver's license, no job, no friends, no girlfriend (haven't even kissed a girl) and most of all, no confidence. All I do is sit in my dark bedroom all day. I'm so severely depressed and thinking things that I shouldn't be thinking. A month ago I decided to make a facebook page to try to get back in touch with the world and old friends. But hardly anyone remembers me and my friend requests to the people I used to know just get declined. I don't know what to do with my life from here on. I honestly think I won't be able to handle another year of this.

I still have trouble with people and it's gotten so much worse. Grocery shopping has even become a chore for me because of the amount of people there are around me. I just wish the social anxiety would end already.

I'm sure you're thinking that all of my problems can be fixed on a moment's notice but it just isn't that easy for me right now. My mother just had her third open heart surgery done about few weeks ago and my grandparents are struggling to keep everything afloat financially. Things are as bad for me as they've always been.

I'm sure this post will be forgotten and probably not even read completely but I just wanted to get my story out there and if I'm very lucky a bit of advice.

Thanks.

but it was literally the best 9 months of my life. i spent every single minute of every single day with my son, and all my pocket change goes directly into savings for him.

She had a guy she barely knew move in with them and almost immediately told my son to call him daddy. Legally there's nothing i can do about this, I'm aware of that, but it does kill me to hear my son call him dad when i pick him up, to the point where i want to go through him, but to do that would only make things worse for me in the eyes of the court.

all i'm asking for is 50/50 custody of my son. but today my lawyer told me that statisticly the chances of that happening are around %2, and there's not much i can do about it.
i'm broken in half thinking about only getting him 2 days a week. he's my son, he's always the first thing i take into consideration when it comes to anything. i spend literally every penny i make on him, doing anything i can to make him smile. i haven't even dated anyone since me and my ex split up because i'm scared to introduce him to anyone or get him confused.  and i don't want any of my time to be taken away from him.

My best friend is very clueless. He was raised in a very *sheltered* environment

1. He is afraid of going to the mall or any store by himself or with someone else our age

2. We had no school one day because of teacher conferences

3. He believes EVERYTHING he reads online, or in other ""news"" sources. He also believes everything his mom tells him. He recently showed me a magazine called ""Infowars"" that was all about how our government was extremely corrupt, how the bill of rights doesn't apply within 200 miles of the boarder, how President Obama is plotting to take over, etc. I thought he was messing with me. It turns out that he actually believes it, because his mom and her boyfriend believe it so it must be true.

4. He had no clue what sex is until I unknowingly explained it to him. He was visibly shaken for hours after that.

5. He believes (or should I say ""his mom believes"") that vaccinations don't actually do anything. His theory is that schools require mandatory vaccinations to get people ready to mindlessly do everything the government says and transition America into a police state. He doesn't really like my father

6. He started growing a mustache and panicked because he ""was starting puberty early and needed to see a doctor immediately"". I also told him that his voice was also getting deeper (big mistake).

7. One of his other friends (who I dislike) got into some trouble. His friend told him ""They suspended me for asking if I could borrow a pencil!"" My friend started freaking out about how he was now an enemy of the school, and how that will show the school. I told him about how no one would give a damn. I then explained about what really happened to his friend. (His friend didn't bring any supplies to class. The teacher was very annoyed with him, but got over it and started class. He was very loudly asking if he could borrow supplies from other students. The teacher told him to stop multiple times, but he kept on disrupting class. He smirked at her the entire time, too. She got mad and sent him to ISS for the rest of the day. Two hours, tops.)

8. He thinks that the government is evil. He told me how they staged the 9/11 attacks, the recent explosion in west Texas, the recent bombing in Boston, and a lot of other stuff.



I care about him a lot. He's going to get himself hurt one day. He infuriates me to no end sometimes

I was really hoping that she would eventually come and talk to me but when I went to check on her she was about to fall asleep.  This got me upset as I was waiting for her to let me know that we could talk again.  I told her that I would not be able to sleep in this situation and I was surprised she was able to.

Well

Upon discovering this my wife was upset that I was not more apologetic towards her.  I tried to explain that we sill had an argument that grew into something that was larger than this event but she feels that I need to somehow make up for this.

We had intended to have breakfast together and I was going to go into the office late.  She told me that I ""might as well leave"" if I was going to act this way so I did (wrong decision).  She has told me that she is disappointed in me and that I need to fix this.

So

If it matters at all my wife stays at home and I am the only source of income.

I keep telling myself ""I'll do it next time"" and most of the time I delay it till the night before the deadline. The only way I can describe it is that I'm waiting for that line block in Tetris to come tumbling down the screen.

Another is how I can't stop thinking about this one girl. She's in the year below me and we met on a trip to Italy in March last year. And we just clicked. She was pretty, and we shared a lot of common interests. And the reason why I haven't spoken to her since then is because I figured it would be too distracting to chase after a girl during the time I need to study. But it's kind of heartbreaking as I walk past her hangout everyday and it reminds me of how I blew my chance. I would do anything to get the chance to bump into her in the corridor and start a conversation with her on Pokemon.

Another problem which is quite annoying, or play some video games with my 'friends, my older brother comes in and annoys the fuck out of me and I can never accomplish anything with him around.

My cousin and I are the same age (mid-20s), on the other hand, continued on.

Four years later

But, and have always had my doubts about her ever being in medical school. Stories just didn't add up. And just a few days ago, I found concrete evidence that she really isn't a doctor.

Not only has she been lying,000 brand new luxury car. I also discovered a 'secret' facebook account of hers with pictures of her partying (which is in stark contrast to her family-only facebook profile with squeaky-clean photos). She spends money like crazy - everything she owns is brand name, and has no problem jet setting to the Bahamas and staying in a 5-star resort every year.

She ""convocated"" this year, not a single picture has emerged of her at convocation, with the cap and gown, diploma, nothing.

Sometimes I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe she really was in medical school and she's just been trolling me by being so secretive.

Well

And it's not just the lying, but she scored in the 98th percentile? She didn't just get into any residency, but one of the most competitive with only two spots available? (And recently, according to my friend who is actually a resident, there is only one resident of that specialty in the entire city, and he's an Asian guy). Is she a compulsive liar?

Even if she was a doctor, go on shopping sprees, luxury vacations, and party like a rockstar?

I want to tell her that I know. I can't imagine what kind of stress she's under for keeping up with such a huge lie. I'm also worried about what she is *actually* doing.

Reddit

What do I hope to accomplish by confronting her? I feel like this started with a small lie. And it's only snowballed. But sometimes keeping up with a lie is easier than telling the truth. Especially after 4 years. I'm trying to put myself in her shoes. If I was living this lie, and that she can be open and honest with me. We grew up together, almost like sisters, but she's always been very closed off and secretive about things she simply doesn't want to talk about. I want to be able to talk about what she's going through, and find help if I can. Also, what's her end game? I could easily have told my family about the website and let them find out for themselves if I wanted a big, dramatic 'HA! I knew it!"" reveal. I want to handle this as delicately as possible. I'm just wondering if this really is a matter I should concern myself with

I learned how to make money
Recently, died. A friend of mine who lives near my parents told her that I was planning on committing suicide when I reach my 40's, due to how I see life as a hostile monster that needs conquering rather than an enjoyable voyage many other individuals seem to convey it as. 

She immediately insisted to move in with me, at least for an outcast like myself.) After a few months, I decided to allow it. 

Ever since she's moved in, as I have a deep hatred towards the human race. I do not show this or tell this to anybody, as I don't believe that my personal views on humanity are to be spread. I may be negative, but I do not wish to ruin the happiness of others, despite how others have treated me in the past. 

Now, dogmatic fictions, aswell as she keeps trying to turn me into some super-optimistic, delusional coward who doesn't see the world for what it is. 

This

A few nights ago, should stay in my room, considering they were more familiar with me than they were with her. I hated the idea, as I knew they would urinate on my bed sheets. She insisted. 

Lo and behold, to which she complained. I told her, that they had pissed on my bed, and that they were to stay in the living room, where the litter box was. She screamed and hollered about how I am abusive towards the cats, even though all I did was grab them and put them outside. She's always stretched the situation to make everything I do seem like I'm an evil prick. 
I went inside my room, and the cats, are missing. 

She's yet to return

So now, but now I feel like a perma-virgin freak who lives with a (attempting) manipulative mother. 

What would be the most appropriate action to take? Should I move out again? Should I ask her to go back to her hometown? Should I speed up the process of my inevitable suicide?

I'm 22F, we have sex once a week. 
My husband was very sexually active in highschool and early college. When we were dating, having never had sex before him, was super excited about it. I wanted it all the time, anywhere I thought we could get away with it. (I've always been a sexually driven kid.) He had more self-control, wanting to cuddle more than actual sex.
Now, after losing his apartment, job, and cutting ties with his family. He's worried that if we have sex too much, our entire relationship will be based on that, and eventually crumble into ruin soon after.

When we first moved out together, ""new place! have sex in ALL THE ROOMS"") There was a short while when we were both working retail, so our schedules didn't match up all that well. Once we both had stable jobs, it picked back up again, and has slowly decreased from about 3 times a week to once. 

He currently works full-time at a warehouse. I do understand that it's a physically taxing job and he's usually pretty tired when he comes home at the end of the day.

I've been...wanting more in our sexual life from pretty much day one. I've tried to talk to him, avoid eye-contact and reply with, ""I know, and I'm a horrible husband, I can't provide for you, I can't make you happy,"" etc. I hate seeing him so self-loathsome, I need to calm my sex-drive
I'm not saying he doesn't make me happy in other aspects of life. I love my husband very much, and our cars running. I appreciate him so much, and I try to show him by keeping the house clean, cooking dinner when I can, and pleasuring him when he doesn't expect it.
I would often give him blow jobs and hand jobs while he plays games
Whenever I (in passing) mention me wanting HIM to start sex instead of me, like ""you're such a good wife, I don't need to start sex!"" but I can't help but be a little offended by it. What about ""taking care of"" me? It seems to me that almost every time we have full-on sex, I have to instigate it. But I want him to start it, now. I want him to pursue me. I keep telling myself that I'll stop giving him handjobs and helping him at night just so he'll want it after a while. But how do I tell him ""No, I don't want to help you tonight before bed"" ALL OF A SUDDEN, when that's been the norm for almost 2 years? 

We're very open with everything else in our lives. We watch porn together and help each other masturbate. But I feel like this is something I can't tell him without making him feel horrible about himself. I feel like I want sex every day and that would make me happy. I know that's physically impossible for most people and it's probably a small form of withdrawal
I do understand that there are couples who haven't had sex in months, but is it bad to have a high-sex drive?

TL;DR: So I guess my question is, that I want him to instigate sex more often? Is my sex-drive absurdly out of control and should I seek medical attention to remedy that? Is 3-4 times a week too much to ask for? Should I stop ""helping"" my husband in an attempt to make him seek me out?

I'm a junior in high school and I can't decide if I should attend my first prom.

I'm unsure because it is a pretty large expense (which my parents can afford with no trouble) but I would hate to feel like I'm wasting money if I don't enjoy myself. I don't have a very great relationship with my classmates; I really can't stand them. Another issue is that I get anxiety pretty easily from things like loud music or crowds. I imagine they'll play rap or country

My best friend convinced me to go today and it's late notice. All I ever do is sit at home by myself and I don't want to feel like I'm missing out. Sure

What was your experience with prom? Do you think it's worth attending?

I would genuinely appreciate your input. Thanks!

8 years ago, hoping to buy an engagement ring for me. We were pretty broke college students, my family had just recently given us their blessings and we had scraped together what little money we had between the both of us to get a ring.

So basically around October/November of this year I did a little bit of experimenting with marijuana. I've always been kind of against drug use because the people I tend to see talking about it, I know a few friends that had done it a couple times and said it was really fun, so I decided I would give it a shot. I'm generally a pretty good kid, by the way. Straight A student. Minimal alcohol use (at least compared to most seniors at my high school). I was just pretty curious about marijuana because of the fact that I'm a political junkie and had been reading a lot about it in light of the medical marijuana movement taking place in the United States. 

I smoked a total of three times, but I was pretty sketched out during the whole experience because I was afraid I would get caught. My friends made fun of me for my sketched-outness, and I basically decided that smoking was not for me. 

About a week/2 weeks later, because apparently they had some way of knowing that I, without a doubt, ""smoked pot."" Eventually I gave in, telling them I had tried it before. Intense interrogation commenced, and I found my mom was actually accusing me of being a huge pot head that smoked all the time. Though I argued against this, they wouldn't believe me due to the fact that I lied to them off the bat. Anyway, and after several torturous weeks of grounding they eventually start to trust me again. 

Now, but somehow, some way, my mom has come to the conclusion that I am definitely smoking weed. I try my best to argue that shes wrong, but she hits me with things like ""why should I believe you?"" If anyone is going to tell me I shouldn't have lied in the first place, I get this now, because it has really come back to bite me. The kicker is that she WILL NOT tell me how she ""knows"" that I'm still smoking. So I can't even try to explain why her source is not valid because she won't tell me what it is. 

Eventually I just gave up on arguing with her as it was the Christmas season and I really didn't feel like dealing with this crap. That night, but if you go there during Christmas time they actually gave some really sweet stuff), and I see that they have home drug tests for marijuana. I get super psyched and pick one up. I was looking forward to just walking in the house like a badass and taking it right in front of them, but they were at a high school basketball game. Remembering that my mom didn't want my sister to know about the whole ordeal, I decided to just take it at home. I text a pic of the negative results to my mom with the words ""The proof is in the pudding."" Hell yeah! Badass move right? Wrong. My mom actually came to the conclusion that I only bought the test to see if I could pass it, and if I didn't I would have thrown it out. She also thinks that if I had smoked in the past week the weed would have been out of my system. Huge, huge backfire. 

Anyway, what am I supposed to do now? Your my last hope reddit, as all my friends do is laugh at the fact that my mom thinks I'm addicted to drugs.

It all started when I realized how there was nothing particularly unique about me as a person. That I had the same interests and likes as a majority of people. It was kind of the realiziation that millions of people in the western world had had very similar upbringings as me and that we all were fed the same things growing up. People like video games, and I was one of those copies. I also realized that most people I was going to school with didn't really care, they just did art because ""arts cool."" I started doing a lot of reading on what made the great artists of the past great. As it turns out it meant dedication and sacrifice even at the possibility. I began to realize that there is a huge amount of theory and philosophy that is required to be a good artist.

The theory and philosophy has pretty much consumed me at this point . I feel like I am meaningless, or that powerful interests control a nations interests regardless. That I am just a member of the masses, and I have no real say or power and that my two choices are either become wealthy or sit down and accept it.

That it is difficult to become exceptional unless your parents had the money to send you to one of the best private schools or academies. That the poor still worship the rich for simply being rich (I'm canadian so the whole royalty thing offends me). That so few people hold themselves to a higher standard

I also can't get over the feeling that I'm being controlled by popular media

Commercialism makes me sick, everyone seems to just think things will happen for them without any effort put into them. We distract ourselves because real life is too awful to take, and we're too afraid to do anything to change it. I'm doomed to be a mediocre middle class nothing. I don't understand why people want material things it's not important. Human communication has been cheapened to shallow nothingness where no one cares about anyone.

There's probably no point to anything anyway, it makes me physically ill. We're just a speck floating around in space, and there is nothing on this planet that will give me peace of mind.

To be honest, that there is nothing you can do and you should lament it. I can't enjoy anything I used to, it's all so ugly and boring, video games, genre fiction, movies, pop music, I've gone to see a counsellor

A couple house lengths down, I notice a rail, like ones bladders use to grind on. I went to go inspect because this was very out of the ordinary. As I was looking at it, something caught my eye.

Background information:

*  My dad has always worked in Norway. He would be away for 2 weeks

*  My sister died of cancer

* My parents divorced as a result

* My dad stayed in Norway for longer and longer periods of time

* A year after they divorced he moved in with my (now) step mother

* They had a baby (born 2002)

* 2 years later they had another baby

* Dad saw me less and less as time went on

* I now see them about 3 times a year when they come over to the UK for family holidays (they have an inordinate amount of time off)

My dad is a money-orientated man, with the assumption that money was a means to an end - not the sole aim of life. My father earns a high salary, my mother is a teacher and does not. 
My stepmother (50) is also money-orientated, a house in England, and a villa in Italy. She has hugely profited from the relationship.

Points of contention:

* She does not like that my father gives me financial support in order to get through university, as well as participate in extra curricular activities which will make me more attractive to the sort of employers I wish to impress (publishers). A retail or catering job would not help me in my pursuit of this career, and would make it harder to achieve in my degree. However, she thinks that I shouldn't be relying on my parents for support at the age of 20. On my 20th birthday, she quietly told me that 'next year you will be 21. Then you will have to support yourself'. 

* She is very impolite, and serving staff in general. In general I bite my tongue, because our relationship is not strong enough to call her out on it. Despite having had her in my life for over 12 years. I find myself suppressing a lot of emotions because I am not brave enough to tell her that she's being entirely unreasonable - or I believe it isn't worth the argument. I also have this problem where my brain can't handle any kind of strong emotion and just sort of hotwires everything to my tear ducts. So I avoid confrontation. If I confronted her about one little thing, I sense that it could escalate very quickly into a screaming breakdown. They already know that I've had counselling about my relationship with my father, and when he said he wasn't going to be there for my 21st birthday I started crying on the phone. I think that they think that I'm a bit unhinged.

* She makes passive-aggressive/snide comments. She is judgemental. She gets irritated when I say 'your' family instead of 'our' family

* I have seen my father alone twice in 5 years. He always brings a child with him when he visits the UK because then it's 'fair' and it's 'nice for them' (her words) - but I want to spend time with him alone. I have expressed this

* My stepmother is loud and obnoxious - overpowering. She has an anecdote for everything and tends to dominate the conversation. I am not an introvert
She's like the embodiment of a Daily Mail reader. I can't tolerate her. A part of me, actively enjoys disliking her. The problem is my problem. And I need help knowing what to do. 

I find it hard to be nice to her because there's so much hurt there. I am hurt that I have been sidelined; that they not only have so much material wealth

The person that I am when I'm around them is not me; I am sulky, in part, destroying my own relationship with them by making them want to see me less and less. When I'm with them I just want to leave in case I burst into tears. I always cry when I get home after seeing them, and it's ridiculous. They're here for a week at the moment and I can't cope. When I see dad on his own/with the kids, it's fine! It's just her presence that puts me on edge. 

How can I repair this situation? A part of me just wants to walk away and not see any of them (which is what my brother did)

About a month ago my husband told me he wanted a divorce. I was shocked. I knew he was stressed out from work and had been less attentive than usual as of late, married for 5.

One day he was acting more distant than usual and I decided it was time to talk. I asked him to sit with me and tell me what was on his mind so we could try to work through it. He said he was stressed out from work. I asked him if he had considered getting another less stressful job

He finally told me that he wasn't happy anymore. He felt like there was too much responsibility in his life and he needed a break from it all. That all he wants is to work

I didn't understand this at all...we had talked about getting a house, cooking and cleaning on top of working a 40 hour overnight job. I thought I was doing everything right. We were best friends and he was my world...He told me he wanted to stay friends, that it wasn't my fault, that I hadn't done anything wrong...I begged him to tell me why, but he had no further reasoning.

He admitted that he had been thinking about divorce since Christmas

He originally told me he'd like to stay friends. I agreed out of sadness and a need to keep him in my life some way. He asked me to move out and I did. We kept in touch for a bit then last night he told me we needed to cut back on communications. He said he knew I was still looking for closure

I'm so confused....he doesn't want to be my husband anymore...and now not even friends even after asking ME to stay friends with him. He made such a big deal about how not having me in his life at all would be too hard. I haven't been harassing him or frequently contacting him

I know I shouldn't care, but I would like to know if anyone else has been through this or can relate and give me some insight... I was also curious if anyone out there that's been through this has been able to move on...I'm afraid I am too broken to ever find love and trust someone again...how could I?

I am 40 and have always been terrible with public speaking.  My speech was predictably awful.  I heard silence and awkward coughs.  Here's some things I wish I would have said:
Do something you enjoy everyday
Push yourself to do difficult things
Be a producer or creator of things sometimes
Remove those people in your life who are toxic.  But think very hard about this one.  If they challenge you sometimes
Express your style and point of view.  Do this as much as you like when it comes to your appearance
Save up money for things you covet
Humour is fun when you're young
Every relationship can have value.  They don't all have to be forever.  Appreciate what they do give you
Think for yourself.  In this age of social media and opinions galore
Don't be afraid to stand out.  Saying or doing things to create discord does not come from a good place
Do something nice for your partner/lover/friend/family you live with, goes a long way.
Treat every new person or stranger with respect.  Strangers do not have to earn your respect.  They've done nothing to you.  Go away to another town or country or place if you want to or need to
Replacing family with a new family will really hurt your original family.  Greatly consider whether this is the right choice

  I'm pretty calm and easy going, I know that he's the kind of person that wouldn't hesitate to go for it. 
  So I had been expecting her to break up with for a while, though she did tell me that everything would go back to normal once the exams have finished. My close friends have told me that they've gone off him since he moved in with her. One of the annoying things is that he's acting completely normal about it, as if he can't see that he's doing anything wrong.

I've been with my current GF for about 2 months now.  I have been completely faithful to her.  Sounds normal, it was for 3 and 1/2 years, and I never cheated on her once, I never even thought about it.

But then, after having suspicions and asking for the last month or so), and had been for MONTHS.  Well I obviously broke it off with her.  It broke my heart.  I didn't even speak with another girl (in any sexual way at least) for a good 6 months.

Well then I got bad off on cocaine (for unrelated reasons), ecstasy) and became a total whore.  I'm totally clean now (STDs and drug-wise, lol).  Turns out I'm pretty charming (or not very picky) when I'm fucked up.  Anyway, I've slept with tons of girls in the two years we've been broken up.

Here's the problem, talked about life, shit that had happened, started hanging out, and now we are dating again.  I decided against my better judgement to give it another go, though I've always thought ""once a cheater, always a cheater.""  But even though I am happy being with her again, but I don't know how long I can last.  I really do love this girl, but now every time a girl propositions me I want to just take her out to her car and fuck her down.

Part of me rationalizes it as me wanting to get back at her, regardless of whether she is sincere or not.  But she is the ONLY girl I ever loved, the others I just looked at as a piece of ass.

1355337958.0,14qkjv,Does this sound like scam or am I just being paranoid? (job offer),kid-vicious,8,0,10,"First things first: I came across a job listing on craigslist. It was for an office management position for a company looking to expand to my city. Although unqualified

I arrive at said office building this morning, as suggested, 15 minutes early. Upon arrival I am horrified to realize that I forgot my resume on the kitchen table at home. Oh, well.. I'll improvise and see what happens. Keep in mind I also don't have a cell phone on me because my sister accidentally took it to her boyfriends house. Back to the story.. I take elevator to fifth floor where I'm immediately brought to a receptionist who asks me my name, and tells me to have a seat while I wait. It's pretty clear to me that this is not the office building for the company who is interviewing me. I assume they rent out the rooms strictly to conduct interviews and meetings. That alone seems fishy, but hell, I don't know much about these procedures. Maybe that's what a lot of companies do.

After about 10 minutes the receptionist tells me that the people I'm scheduled to meet with are conducting interviews at the moment and will be a little late. So I end up waiting almost 40 minutes in the lobby before a heavy set man in a suit walks over to me. He appears to be of Indian decent, but that he would just interview me himself instead.

He leads me to an empty office and asks me to have a seat. I inform him that I do not have my resume with me and he doesn't seem to mind much. He instead asks me to tell him about myself. I go on to explain my job history and such, and credentials. He does occasionally ask me standard interview questions such as how I would handle certain situations, how I've handled things at previous jobs, but overall I would say he did about 75% of the talking during the interview. Explaining what his business is about and what would be expected of me.

He tells me that he works for HSE, GPS watches, ect. I am told that they are looking to expand to my city and that they need a Manager to oversee their daily operations at the office they intend on opening. He tells me that I would be in charge of hiring and firing, I would work 5 days a week, I choose whether to work 9-5, 10-6, 11-7, but that the job is still very serious. He even goes on to tell me that

Here is where it gets fishy. Towards the end of the interview he informs me that, but it's crucial to my success. He tells me there will be lots of homework and presentations and things of that nature. The only issue is that training costs $200. He explains to me that they charge for the equipment and other necessities that are provided during the training process. I was under the impression that most businesses pay YOU for training. Anyway, he then tells me that if I finish training in less than a week I would be given $1,000 for completing training. However, if it takes me more than a week, I still get $800. Finally, he says if it takes me any more time than that

According to him, to which he did give me very informative and detailed responses. Either his business is legit or he is a very calculated and prepared scam artist. I finish up my questions and he says he still has to talk to his superiors, of course, but that I should expect a call tonight with regards to my status and training details. He does say that the 200 dollars would be required tomorrow and that they would give me more information in the phone call tonight. 

The entire time he seemed way more concerned about informing me about the company and job description than me giving him 200 dollars. He mentioned the money just once and didn't make a big deal out of it. I didn't feel like I was being scammed at the time, no resume, no experience and he was still very interested in me. He supposedly works for a big company, but doesn't seem to mind that I'm under-qualified as far as credentials go. I was very professional and did make a very good impression on him by being well dressed, well spoken, keeping eye contact, and giving very good answers,,False,t3_14qkjv

One year ago I made a new group of friends at a social gathering. One guy in particular caught my fancy and we went on a date. It went very well, his girlfriend is probably cool too. 

Low and behold, it was only one time and it was at least two months prior to them dating. We are exclusively friends and nothing inappropriate has ever happened between us.

Now the second part. I can't give away too much information but I will do my best. I was in town on my birthday and my friends wanted to hang out. So we went out, and gave me weird looks when I would crack jokes. She essentially treated me like I was some socially inept freak and humiliated me.. on my birthday. Towards the end of the night she began to verbally berate me (such as, ""what the hell is she talking about?"" after I would make jokes or comments to my friends.)

Reddit, how can I deal with her mean attitude without being too harsh or sinking to her level? Ignoring her won't always work because like I stated before she will say things out loud about me and it is embarrassing. I've never been in a situation like this before.

It was his word versus a witness but every piece of circumstantial evidence pointed to him having done it. He has already had numerous suspensions and was facing a possible expulsion if he was caught. After a serious father-son talk he eventually confessed to me after I promised I wouldn’t tell the school or mum (my partner). I then lied to the school to protect him but made it clear to him I was doing this as a one-time favour and I would not protect him like this again in future. I am the only person that knows for a fact he did it. How do I punish him when I am unable to explain to anybody else why he is being punished?

2: He has an 11 year old girlfriend and things are moving rather too quickly for my liking. Both myself and my partner have observed that the girl is rather sexual for her age (when they think they’re not being watched we’ve seen her dry humping him and initiate fondling etc). They go to school together and live close to each other so there is ZERO possibility of doing anything to keep them apart. I do not want to be one of those parents that forbids a child from seeing someone … however I also have zero intention of tending to the child of my 12/13 year old step-son. I’ve had numerous “birds and bees” talks with him and he admitted that French kissing and “doctor and nurse” style fondling is regular play with them. I have told him that if it gets to the sex stage he HAS to come and see me regarding a condom. What else can I do to educate him and hopefully prevent them from having sex at such a young age?


TL;DR: 

1: How to punish step-son for stealing when I am the only person that knows he did it?

2: How to educate 12 year old step-son who is probably very close to having sex?

Some information:

 * I live in Louisiana (An At-Will state)
 * I have worked here since December 2003
 * My hotel is shutting down on July 8th for 2-3 years for renovations (there is a possibility the owners will say ""fuck it"" and close it this Sunday)
 * I was just notified yesterday

Other things to note

 * have worked 40 hours a week since week 2 of employment as a night auditor
 * have never called in to work
 * Have only been significantly late twice outside of unforeseeable problems (i.e car problems)
 * have came in to work early and on off days **countless** times in 8.5 years
 * have worked though very tough times at hotel (working 12 hour shifts cause everyone but my manager and I had quit, etc....)
 * Car broke down in 2010
 * Only taken approx. 2.5 weeks of vacation of which only 1 week was actually paid
 * I've only gotten $1.50 in raised in 8.5 years (minimum wage has gone up $2.10 since 2003)
 * the job has no benefits


So

1.) I am fairly sure my employers will not offer me a severance package.  They are very, despite the fact that they are owners of a company that probably makes hundreds of millions of dollars a year.  When it came to this hotel, they would do absolutely anything they could save money, even on things like forgoing on fixing essentials essential things of a hotel.  Because of this, I am assuming they will not offer me one.  So, given everything that I have listed above and the really short notice on being laid off, I am going to ask for one.  

Can anyone give advice on how I should present my request?  How I should word it?  Tips on convincing them I deserve a severance package?  How much should I ask for?  After some quick google searching

**How can I not only negotiate a severance package


2.) Unemployment, then transfer it to the other state? Should I even bother applying until I move to the new state.

I am a single 31 year old male with no kids.  I have been working since I was 16 (technically 15).  This is my third job ever.  I haven't been without a job since the mid 90s.  I am clueless.

I find her in the sophomore section. Since she's stuck in high school for another two years I knew that was probably the last day I'd ever see her.

I thought fuck that, but I shit you not reddit it was like some strange force subconsciously told me to look to my right and when I did my breath fucking caught because there I see her hand in hand with some dude but she's looking right at me with that same fucking smile and when she notices me turn, it was like her smile got bigger. I did a double take because holy shit it was like fate was saying ""here's your last shot talk to her before she's gone for good.""  
  
  And in that moment of her beaming that smile at me; I was too stunned by her unexpected presence that I just gaped at her for a few seconds and turned away to look at my mom.

I don't post on here often, but I do need help. I am a 24 y/o  suffering from depression and suicidal ideation. I've had these thoughts for quite some time and I've gone to see a doctor. I use to work for a call center making decent money, but lost my job because of my failures to communicate properly with my HR team when I had an anxiety attack and needed a leave of absence. I've seen a doctor and I'm on Cymbalta, an SNRI, and Serpquel XR.

Let me preface this by saying that my youngest kid was born with a cleft lip and palate.  He has had several surgeries and at 4.5 years old

So the Lone Ranger movie by Disney had a villain.  The makeup folks decided that they would give him a cleft lip scar to make him more sinister.  What a birth abnormality has to do with that

But then LEGO puts out a set with this character ""whose terribly scarred face is a perfect reflection of the bottomless pit that passes for his soul.""  That is from their site.  Really?

I sent them an email containing this paragraph:

""I am not as worried about how my son (or the thousands of other children that are born with this defect each year) will see this, who is going to be the 'bad guy'?  Who is going to be chased by all of the kids who want to be the 'hero'?  I know that you didn't create the character, but you certainly had the power to not represent a condition that (through no fault of their own) kids are going to have to deal with for a lifetime. You had the power not to perpetuate a completely false negative stereotype.  You had the power to make a positive decision and statement.  Unfortunately, you did not have the good judgement.""

After I got a form letter back from them

""Many of these children are tube fed as infants because they cannot form suctions.  Then they spend the first years of their lives trying to learn to eat correctly, orthodontic surgeries to rebuild their gums, years of straightening out their teeth, and more surgeries as their bodies mature.

When I was about 4-5 years old, including raping her into her teens. Most recently, in the last 2 years, I have been remembering more details of my abuse and have been wanting to get to the bottom of it. One thing I have always remembered was the child on child sexual abuse from neighborhood kids. It was out on control. All of the children in my neighborhood, including myself of course, were very secretive about it. It ended at about age 9.

When I was about 14

I ended up on the streets for several months, and out of fear, I fired the gun and a man came to take me away where I ended up in a mental ward getting a psyche evaluation (which I had no diagnoses other than I have issues I need addressed but I have no mental psychosis to speak of) and later put in juvenile detention.

I was supposed to spend 2 years in a juvenile detention facility and ended up only staying for 13 months for good behavior and successfully completing my treatment program. During my treatment in juvi

Fast forward to age 19. I was picked up by my grandfather one day while waiting at a bus stop to attend a job interview. My grandfather pulled me closer to him in his old car (which had a bench seat in the front) and began rubbing his hand close to my pubic area under my dress, telling me ""you're worth it."" I jumped out of the car and vowed to never speak to him again.

This brought on instant memories of my childhood with him.

I tried to have the incident reported and a member of my family threatened my life if I said another peep about it. So I shut my mouth. (Grandfather is dead now by the way

Remembering more of my childhood through out the next few years

We moved on with our lives and went back to being close siblings.

Over the next decade up until now, he also didn't want it at the same time. I explained to him that if he was that confused, he should get help; therapy. I myself was in therapy for a past abusive relationship where I was diagnosed with PTSD over, as well as the abuse I endured from my childhood. He declined going into therapy with me but we remained close up until about a month ago.

Now that we are adults

I now have 2 children, my brothers girlfriend was extremely passive aggressive toward us (that is a TL;DR story for certain) and we finally moved out last month. She wouldn't return our belongings, started trying to turn my family against each other and all around, is just not a nice person -- she is one nasty woman and we came to our own conclusion that this person is a sociopath. (can ask me in comments for details on why she is a sociopath and I will answer).

Upon warning a mutual friend about this sociopath, which I nor him do not recall. Through out emailing each other 2 days ago, and further admitting exactly what I said to him years prior that I may have done something to him as a child, when I was a child, he said to me ""so you DID do something, I knew it, you sick piece of shit pedophile. I am going to have a nice conversation with your kids dad and tell them everything and how you molest little kids and that you don't deserve to be around children period. You deserve to be in prison and I am going to make sure you never see your kids again and you go to prison for what you did to me."" Then further claiming, that he doesn't even remember what happened.

My mom is in hell about this right now, whom I should mention has a masters degree is psychology but never made it as a psychiatrist and is now taking up law (that's what sociopaths do), she will not stop texting my mother about this, saying that she always takes sides with me (which she does not, my mother loves both of her kids equally).

This sociopath woman is also 15 years older than my 29 year old brother

We'll just refer to this woman as a sociopath from here on out: So the sociopath is now relentlessly telling my mother that I belong in prison for being a sex offender and that I am a sociopath because of the child abuse and that everyone should listen to her since she has a masters degree in psychology. She's also a master at displaying an extreme amount of anxiety and cannot function under the slightest amount of stress but can sit there and feed my brothers fire with sociopathic gasoline by way of trying to get my mother to take sides with them about me being this monster; trying to get my mother to hate me or something

I feel that the person here who needs the help is my brother, I often feel like my brother may even come after me, by way of coercion from the sociopath, and kill me or something.

I don't know what to do

Can you be convicted of something as an adult for something that happened as a child? I mean

I am no monster. And if I was a sociopath

I shouldn't have done that, not for another 10 years, since a lot of people around me are homophobic.

My intention was to not hurt her by rejecting her, that she didn't talk to me for the next 6 months or so, and it pains me to think about her, and I think about her so much. Every time I see her, I feel guilt, shame and sadness. I would really not mind if she would hurt me or even kill me.

1363097631.0,1a5boc,About to marry into a dysfunctional family. Advice?,ndougla2,8,0,6,"I'm going to try to keep this as short as possible

My fiancee's (I will refer to her as A) brother-in-law (B) is a colossal douchebag.  He's arrogant, so he thinks he knows what is best for a family and never fails to spout off his bullshit.  


About a year ago, he was holding on to the baby's hands and swinging her around all over the place, which made a lot of us nervous.  I calmly said ""B, that's a pretty dangerous thing to do to an infant""  He snapped.  ""Don't tell me what's best for my child, you have no experience in the matter.""  Which is sort of true, I have a lot of experience with toddlers and older, but not infants and I wasn't going to pick any fights on Christmas.

Very recently, B told him that he could not talk to her without him being there.  A's father (not in an aggressive tone) asked him to please leave as this was something he wanted to tell her in private.  B flew off the hook, exclaiming that she will never talk to him without him being there.  Then there was an ego supernova.  A's father called B arrogant, and B grabbed his wife by the arm, yanked his daughter right out of A's mothers arms, and stormed out.  

A's sister still had no idea what the news even was.  She found out later via text message.  A day goes by and we all figured the situation had defused itself.  One evening, and stormed upstairs where A's father was watching tv.  He started ripping into him about being a terrible father, a terrible husband, and ungodly (hypocrite, much?).  He told him that he will never see or speak to his daughter or granddaughter again, and left.  He changed A's sister's phone number, and gave it out to the rest of us, he said they changed it because people from A's sister's old job were calling 30+ times a day

B sent a text to me and A that said ""I just wanted to let you know that my wife and I are not speaking to [A's father].  Thought you should know before the shit hits the fan""

That's the backstory.  Here's where we stand currently:

I did something that I usually do not do and I got involved, so I'm not sure how he's supposed to do that).  I've never considered A's father a particularly good father or husband, but I paid the amount of respect to him that I felt was appropriate.  I always chalked it up to be unhappy with his lot in life.  And so I told him about the story of my parents, who had a very similar relationship until their divorce, at which point everyone became happier.  My family still spends holidays together, dad and mom in the same room, laughing and talking about days past.  He outright told me that I will never have a model for a healthy marriage and that his parents have been together for x-whatever years (remember

B is now claiming (only to me) that A's father was abusive and performed ""traumatic acts"" against A's sister

A's sister won't respond to text messages, but I honestly don't want B to be there, and telling him that I don't endangers A's sister status as Matron of Honor (he WILL try to stop her).  If A's mom babysits for them, B requires her to leave if A's father comes home, and call him immediately so that he can come pick her up.  Any time A's mom wants to spend time with A's sister, B tags along (to monitor conversation, I'm sure).  He won't let A's sister have a 1 year birthday for their daughter because he knows she will want to invite the family.  

The whole situation is fucked and, but I've remained civil this whole time, and I'm not going to break that now.  I have no idea where to go from here.  He'll continue to think he knows best and will maintain a stranglehold on his marriage and keep his wife and daughter from the rest of us if no one does anything.  But what can be done?  Any effort seems futile to me.  It's been about 2 weeks since I talked to B about it, and I don't know if I want to bring it up again, or even how to do that.  It's breaking my future mother-in-law's heart, because she's effectively lost her daughter and granddaughter in one swift moment, and her being in turmoil over it infuriates me at B's selfishness and arrogance.

Ages (so you can get an idea of what stage in life we're all at, A's mother is 60, A's father is late fifties.  B is a bit old to be acting so juvenile, in my opinion.

I’m really, even if just a little bit, after posting, and I just want to not feel like I’m going crazy anymore. I’m afraid of posting this because, on another internet forum of which I am a member, I asked for related advice and was attacked. I am ashamed to say I am a person who gets offended at words on the internet, and I know how dumb I am. Am I stupid for saying that? Ok onto the bullshit: 

Graduated in ’07 with a BFA, but I thought I could do it if I just worked as hard as I possibly could. School was too expensive, couldn’t seem to get any grants or scholarships, so I had to attend a community college my first year, but it was ok! I was filled with so much hope, and I worked very hard with my studies, got top grades in all of my classes, signed my name onto $80k worth of private loans
Couldn’t afford to not have a full-time job to pay for rent, very little else. Lived off of ramen and got pretty ill after a while because of it, funny story related to this tidbit I will tell at a later time. 
Due to working a 35-40 hour a week job as well as school full time, I just knew in my heart that I could have definitely done a lot better if I only had more time to try. One example of this is when I started to learn 3d: the place I worked was shutting down and so I spent more freetime than I wanted on finding something else, including going to my career services and asking for an internship but being denied because… nope, I don’t have any idea. I think the woman there just didn’t like me, I know it sounds like a bullshit excuse but I have no idea why a persistant, capable student was denied an internship. Maybe I just came off as a shithead and she didn’t want to waste anyone’s time, who knows. Anyway, but I definitely wasn’t the best

I got better and better, amazing, etc.) and with fresh degree in hand, I landed an interview. It actually went amazingly well, but I did not get the job. I think I failed the art test because it was in 3d and not 2d where I am most strong, and there must have simply been a stronger candidate. Had to move home due to lack of funding (quit my job the last four months of school to focus on portfolio work) and back in with my mom in Indiana. 
Depression set in halfway through my BFA, so awful. My relationships were strained, and luckily that was the only thing that suffered while in college, but after I got out and failed at getting the job I had worked so hard for, it took away everything. Because of strained relationships in college, I have limited contacts. In this industry I have heard a million times that it’s not about how good you are, but who you know. Fucked myself over pretty big I guess. 
I finally got a job doing something administrative, but notice that drawing becomes more and more difficult. 
Some life drama happens including all friends from college dropping off the face of the earth, bf becomes distant, some other things too etc.
 Stop drawing altogether. 

2009: Move to Oregon with $1000 in my pocket, but I moved to be closer to more relevant jobs!
Admin job is at a call center, but am able to create some things. 
Had my boyfriend of ten years fuck me over, we end up breaking up after he tells me he hasn’t loved me for years anyway. The start-up company tells me not to come back via email due to lack of work on their end. Extreme depression. Crawl back to my call center job after a month of desperately seeking employment. 
Start to feel myself again slowly but surely. An internet guy I was extremely close to in college (but the ex hated that I talked to) comes back into my life. He tells me he believes in me
With something in my life going correctly, and 3d is infinitely frustrating since I’m not great at it, but I feel I am finally using my degree! One of my clients is a small company that sells ideas to Adidas. Most of my projects involve Adidas things, so when I later saw Adidas hiring an on-site, 3d Artist, I put together my portfolio and applied. Denial email less than 24 hours later. Accept that I must be just “passable” at 3d and definitely not “good” but I should simply work harder if I want to be employed doing it. Fighting off feeling really down about this acceptance. 

Stop doing freelance after this setback
Left crappy
Currently: 
- indie game project where I am the only artist
-illustrating a children’s book 
-getting ready to release my webcomic

Find out last month that my new job is not going to hire me on full time as I intially thought
Start looking for some kind of art job that I can apply to right now
Start looking for admin jobs. Nothing except considerable paycuts and more stress. Depression creeping back in.

What the fuck do I do with my stupid life? 

I'm sick of working administrative jobs where, but deciding what path to take is apparently my downfall. I can’t get hired because I lack experience, and I’m working for free on all these other projects hoping they will make me look good to employers, but I’m not sure if it will work. 
There seem to be more 3d jobs avaiable in general, but if I stop doing 2d only to have all of my hard work not pay off again… I’m not sure if I could handle the disappointment. I love doing 2d, I’m best at it, but I’m finding a 9-5 decent paying (ie: not poverty level) job does not exist. I can do other things, I can use many different programs, but it seems like all of the jobs I’m seeing that are hiring require some other skill that I can’t even lie about having (ie: ability to code or program) I’m not sure we live in an economy that can support artists, or maybe I just haven’t worked hard enough. 
PS: I typed in a lot of incomplete sentences and I’m very sorry if it’s painful to read because of this

My sister(a) is stealing money. This is an ongoing thing. Approximately a year ago, nothing ever came of it. No punishments, maybe a stern talking-to.

My father allegedly talked to (a) once again, but (b) reports that he was willing to give his debit card to (a) only a day later to get eggs from the store. 

These are only the times that we know that she has stolen large amounts of money. She has the access to my father's debit card and we could have missed other instances or she could simply being stealing smaller amounts that we are unable to catch.

- Inability to commit.

    Examples: relationships ended for no real reason, a flat

    Effects: Things do not happen

    Causes: 1) Fear of missing out on other options
                 2) Fear of getting stuck in problematic situations (If I buy a car I'll have to take care of it


- Inability to work and get things done

    Examples: days spent sitting at work doing nothing

    Effects: Things do not happen. My job is at risk

    Causes: 1) Being lazy
                 2) Lack of energy
                 3) Lack of focus
                 4) Lack of involvement

- Destructive or unwanted thoughts

    Examples: fantasies of being dead or never waking up from my sleep or intrusive images of me firing a gun to my head (at least twice a day)

    Effects: self-disgust, self-pity (which causes more self-disgust)

    Causes: 1) above 2 problems leading to low self-esteem

Three days ago, in the common area of our apartment. She noticed another tenant had a dog trainer with him, and was having his dog learn how to go down the stairs. Hubert is still too little to go down stairs, so she was just holding and watching. The dog trainer noticed her standing there, and she made a passing comment about how Hubert still can't go down stairs. Before she knew what happened, he had grabbed Hubert from her hands, said ""I'll help him"" and attached his leash to Hubert's collar. My wife very reluctantly agreed - he had a very aggressive, he was YANKING Hubert down the stairs. Of course, calling her a bad pet owner for using a retractable leash
I can't tell you how wrong that guy is - my wife is the most loving person in the world
ANYwho, he chipped a bone in his back leg. The vet says it's consistent with tumbling down the stairs. So, this little dude can't get a cast because of the positioning of the chip - meaning that we literally have to sedate him for the next three weeks and not allow him to do ANYTHING. It's freaking heartbreaking. This cute little ball of energy and love isn't allowed to run, jump, stand, chew, play
So, calling my wife a liar, all this stuff. Eventually, by being really mellow and calm, I get him to agree to call our vet. He then proceeds to hang up on several different people from the vet's office, curses them, calls them dishonest, again berating us for using a retractable leash, and I'm also pretty sure he won't be ponying up for any more.
So my question is - do I take to yelp with this guy? I have an elite account, it's killing me to think that someone else may have to go through this. I can't imagine another innocent animal being totally abused by this guy, simply because I DIDN'T speak up online. At the same time - this guy seems like he has the propensity to be an extra-dick, and take things way too far. I see him as someone willing to get personal, and I'm not sure if I'm up for that fight.

1349548322.0,111v3b,Should I take Verizon to small claims court?,clamjumpr,10,1,6,"A couple months ago I took my iphone 4s into Verizon because it was acting quite strange.  It wasn't charging and I could not change the volume for the ringer or music.  The representative that helped me looked at the phone and thought that my phone was exhibiting some very peculiar behaviors.  After about 5 minutes playing with my device he tells me there is no water damage (based on the fact that the water activated sensors were not color changed) and therefore will replace my phone under warranty. He said that my new iphone will ship to me in 3-5 days and that I should put my damaged iphone into the box the new phone shipped in and return it to Verizon.  So the phone came and I sent the old one back no problem.  

Fast forward a couple months.  I receive a bill in the mail from Verizon and I see a charge for $299 on my bill for ""damaged device""  I immediately call Verizon and they proceed to tell me that upon receiving my device they discovered corrosion on the charge port and that my device had its warranty voided because of it. Im obviously furious at this point because the guy at the store who looked at my phone deemed it a warranty issue and now im being charged for the phone.  The problem here is that i would gladly take my old phone back and try to get it repaired elsewhere but Verizon has a no ship back policy once it gets to the warehouse. So basically im being FORCED into buying this phone.  I feel like Verizon is stealing from me and there's nothing I can do.  I have gone up the hierarchy of customer service managers only to come to the same result.  ""Im sorry
Im extremely upset that im being muscled into paying this fee when I honestly had no idea this could happen.

I have no job (I have no degree in this VERY competitive market and I'm losing hope), no prospect for money), my boyfriend of 3.5 years is preparing to dump me (I can sense it and know it's coming, this is the man I wanted/thought I was going to marry) and I'm 90% positive that I have developed cervical cancer (I had an abnormal pap smear a few years ago and a colposcopy/biopsy that revealed a high grade abnormality - I lost my job and my insurance before I could have a LEEP procedure so I never had any follow-up treatment, now I have severe abdominal pain and I have abnormal bleeding), my family is broke and nobody can afford to help me, I have no friends - they're all married and busy having babies now. I'm all that's left of the girls who aren't spoken for and it hurts so deeply that I am embarrassed to admit it makes me feel like a failure as a woman.  

I don't qualify for public assistance, I used to have an Rx for antidepressants but my doctor won't refill it without a $150 visit, I can't get any private loans because I have medical bills I couldn't pay and have wrecked my credit as a result, and to top it all off I've got two auto-immune diseases that I can't afford to have treated and I'm gradually becoming too sick to function normally.

I'm in trouble and there is no help coming and it's a terrifying feeling. I've got nobody to talk to and everything is crumbling around me and I am powerless to stop it. I am realizing that I'm never going to be a mom, will never happen for me. This isn't a solicitation for anything other than to show people how quickly everything you think you have can slip away from you. Life offers you no guarantees. The only thing about all of this that really upsets me or scares me is that if I do have cancer I don't want to die in pain or have my condition financially impact my family, that's the only thing I am afraid of, everything else that will happen and has happened are things that only make me sad and remorseful.

Redditors i need your help.,redditismytherapy,9,1,7,"Ok i don't know where else to turn or where to post this but my life is spinning out of control and i need your guys' input and help. Please forgive me if i posted this in the wrong section but Ive been reading this site for about a year now and enjoy it a lot and have seen a lot of people really uplifted by others on here. I am looking for that in a terrible time for myself. Apologies for any typos or spelling or grammar errors.

Quick Breakdown:
I am 27 years old, and struggling with school, addictions, and relationship issues.

I was very motivated in college and high school

Started to drink heavily in college, cocaine, mushrooms, and weed. I used to take 4-5 mg of xanax a day and kicked that habit. It took almost 6 months to do that. I used to take oxycontin a lot as well and kicked that. I have a very addicting and type a personality.

Now through all this drug use I maintained great grades and got into grad school. I partied throughout undergrad and got good grades and met beautiful girls and had plenty of fun and gfs and meaningful relationships. I had friends and everything was going great.

I then entered grad school at which point I was smoking heavy amounts of weed before (months to a year). I did poorly in my first year of grad school and took a year and a half off of school to do ""research"" aka get my life in order. After I came back I continued to smoke marijuana

I met the girl of my dreams but we always fight. The fights are petty and they are caused by my rage issues. This is brought upon by weed (I think).

I saw numerous shrinks and therapists and after a few cocktails settled on taking some celexa every day. I was feeling normal but still smoking around 3-5 grams of weed a day. I have terrible mood swings, sometimes i get really sad and depressed for no reason...

Ive tried quitting weed and i can't. Ive quit taking xanax and ox and those are physically addicting but weed is hard for me to quit. I am starting school in a month and i continuously rage against my gf and cause fights and yelling and arguments bw us

I know the weed is affecting my brain and taking 40mg of celexa a day (for about 4 months now) could be mixing for a bad combo.

I recently broke up with my gf and have had the strongest urge to kill myself. Ive been thinking about it nonstop mainly bc a lot of people now view me as a failure

I know this post sounds weird and is all jumbled but I honestly didn't know what to do. My friends are all moved out of the state

Last night I tried cutting my wrists but didn't have the courage to do it. I want to kill myself but I think its more of giving up. Ive been smoking copious amounts of weed to try to handle the stress of starting school up again and breaking up with my girl.

I finally got my life together, but had finally gotten ready to start school and do well and now my gf (my life, my other half, she is the only one that understands me and i recently purchased an engagement ring for her) doesn't want anything to do with my raging and my temper tantrums and my craziness.
I think she will not come back to me and the last time we broke up i lost my mind

Reddit I have seen you pull someone from the shallow depths of hell to at least feeling good about themselves. For someone who was on the top of the world I am at the bottom and i need someone's help.

Through all this jumble two goals remain clear:
MARRY MY GF AND FINISH GRAD SCHOOL

Two simple goals and my rage and anger is getting in the way. Also i think that weed has now started to affect my emotions and brain from three years of heavy use (in the past three years i have smoked at least 3-4 grams a day EVERY DAY all day with only two 48 hr periods of soberness you could say I am a highly highly functioning weed/drug addict)

Now i am smoking tons more weed and even thinking about taking xanax and i can't stop thinking about my gf who dumped me

Sadly, crying because he gambled away all our money (joint account, she earned much more than he did). I grew up believing her when she said she'd divorce him when I turned 18. At one point my mom was convinced that he was cheating on her. 

An example of his shitty parenting? My mom would slave away in a manufacturing plant and leave me in his care. He would take me to a racetrack and proceed to gamble (her) money away. He would leave a 5 year old girl in a tiny arcade, one day I had to go to the washroom and got lost. I still remember crying, in a neon yellow Mickey Mouse shirt, asking random adult men if they had seem someone who looked like my dad. Eventually, a security guard helped me find him. 

In high school, and have landed a great job. In the past couple of years, it's like a switch has been turned off - household chores without complaint, volunteering to drive us everywhere, rarely any arguments... 

My issue is that I don't trust him or his motives. He has no retirement money saved up, but it's been easy to ""forget"" that because of the recent normalcy.

Our family does not do feelings, never told her, and then lost it all through stocks). I have never been hugged by my parents. I know my mom loves me through her actions. My dad, on the other hand... I just feel like I am one fucked up kid. How do I sort my feelings out?

Anyways, but I swear its only whenever we are out there). If not, they will sit outside on their driveway every day with their wiener dogs. No biggie, its your house, I could however do without your piercing demonic stares every time I’m outside as well. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I AM OUTSIDE I AM BEING WATCHED BY THE WRINKLE EYES

My street usually has quite a few cars parked on it and I have to park my car in the street as well. Luckily there’s a space in the cul-de-sac between our houses that I can park my car in and walk up my driveway. Well, they put their trash cans in the street. Conveniently in the only place I’m able to park without walking a little ways. Well we had just moved in and I didn’t want to make a huge deal about it, so I moved the cans out of the way and kindly explained I needed to park there and asked them if they wouldn’t mind put them on the sidewalk (which is closer in the first place), Mildred told me not to touch their trash again and for me to find somewhere else to park or they were calling the cops. Really now Mildred?  I know what ill do, ill just park my car with the bumper on the curb and the car sticking out into the cul-de-sac next to the trash can since she’s being such a royal cunt. I’ve seen other people do it, it should be fine. I came out a little later to a ticket  on my windshield and little Mildred thanking the cop as she left.  Apparently your car has to be parked against the curb in a cul-de-sac. Well shit.
 
A mobile mechanic came to my house to do some repairs on my car the other day, luckily it wasn’t trash day) As he was working  away, Eugene came out of his house to tell him,  “I am a part of the homeowners association, and you need to get your tools off the grass because you are killing it” This is in OUR yard, not his. The mechanic working on my car got really uncomfortable after this, as our neighbors sat outside staring at him and I the entire time after the comment was made. The mechanic we have gone through for years no longer wants to come to us because the bullies next door can’t mind their own business. WHAT!?

To put the cherry on top of their bullshit sundae, here comes Eugene in his giant 2013 Dodge Ram driving home the opposite way on my street.  there were no other cars on this particular part of the street at the time and like any normal, sensible person would  I pulled my little Honda over to the right, as I did this motherfucker pulled as close to me as he could (im talking literally inches away) HONKING at me trying to run me off the road! WHAT THE FUCK

This is absolutely ridiculous and we are at our limit with these old fuckers. Any ideas on how to deal with or fuck with these demonic neighbors ? Remember: they are elderly so I don’t want to do anything that extensive

TL;DR I need help dealing with these old fuckers

She then kicked me twice into the chest, again hurting. 

I held her down for three or four seconds and hit her a slap in the face. I'm not proud, that I should never have someone in my life, that I should die alone. Once I had done it I jumped up, left the room, might have said something in anger (can't remember what) and went downstairs. I stood in the kitchen, shook like a leaf, began crying and went back up to see if she was ok.

She just kept saying she wanted to go (all understandable). I asked for just two seconds to explain and she let me eventually. I hugged her, that I love her.

I’m hoping to find one meaningful response that will help me out. I’m going to describe my life and situation in as few words as possible and hopefully you can get a sense of who I am and where I’m coming from.
I’m a 17 year old male going into my senior year of high school this September. Each year I attend a different school. My mom moves us a lot because of how poor we are. I consider myself smarter than most and even good looking. If you were to see me in person you would assume I was rich and even a model. I only say this because it’s what I’m told. I realize it might sound conceited and self centered and I might be because most of the kids my age I’m encounter disgust me. They have so much more opportunity than me and it’s just wasted. I feel like an old angry man in a teenager’s body.

I don’t have nice things like a cell phone or laptop most of the year I don’t even have cable &amp; internet. And yeah you guessed it my mom’s on welfare so are house is covered by the government and trust me its humiliating. I’ve been homeless before too
Every dollar I get from my mom or from the little things I do to get cash go towards nice dressy clothing used to disguise who I truly am. I fool people by dressing up and looking good because I’m terrified of being picked on. Don’t tell me not to worry about what people think either because I constantly tell myself that and it should help that I only know them for less than a year but it doesn’t I can’t help it I have no confidence. I’ve gotten that feeling in your chest where your heart sinks more than enough times that’s why I try to play the role prince and keep to myself as best as possible. The problem is my grades in school and I didn’t do great these first three years because I just didn’t realize how much they mattered. My mom didn’t help either it’s not like there was any way of punishing me I had nothing she could really take and she never gave real motivation. So I just slacked off and focused on keeping my true identity a secret from my peers. Half way through this past school year I really started trying and both 3rd and 4th quarters I received nearly straight A’s on my report card.

So what can I do. In one year I’m going to be done with high school and my current plan is I will join the Air Force and serve 4 years and then go to college using the GI bill and major in Computer Science. I’m confident that I can pass my senior year with straight A’s in every course; I’m going to work as hard as possible. I will work my *** off to get good SAT scores as well but when the year is over I don’t think any nice university is going to accept me because of my past 3 years. And even if they did I couldn’t afford it because I’m dirt poor. That’s why I want to join the military free education; I’m told it sounds good to employers and will help better me as a person.

I want to own a Porsche a nice house and have relationship with the perfect girl. I want to be a part of the 1% and don’t tell me money doesn’t buy happiness or to be realistic because it’s all I think about 24/7 I want it more than anything. I want to be close to that 1%. It's my dream that I would kill for.What’s a good path for me to take out of high school?

1374019970.0,1ig97n,Should I sell my dog?,friendlysharpshooter,7,0,9,"So 4 months ago I realized my dream of getting a border collie puppy. At the time I was living on a farm with a flock of ducks and some goats

Flash forward to the present: My landlord has kicked me off the farm (he wanted to move back with his family), and I hardly have any time to spend with him because of my job. On top of that I am looking for a new place to live (my lease is up in November), and am finding that it is very hard to find a place to rent when you have a dog. My life would be so much easier without my puppy, and I am concerned that by leaving him alone all the time he will develop bad/neurotic behaviors. I feel so bad about it, because I do love him and he is so sweet when we are together, but I am considering selling him to someone who will be able to use him in his intended role as a farm dog.

This breaks my heart, shelter, vet and affection when I'm around, sure, but he should be on a farm herding sheep, not cooped up in my house 10 hours a day.

I am a 24 year old male, i did a lot of (slave) work. Cleaning, guard duty and stuff like that.

I am now back in my hometown, grocery stores (all offering part time only at minimum wage) I would have to pick up 3 of these at least to support my family at a below poverty level. 

We live with my wife's parents at the moment who are retired

Here's the problem i have now. I spent the last four years of my life gaining next to no work skills, but not enough for a managerial position. 

 I am in with multiple temporary staffing agencies as well, resume and they say there are openings, and there probably are, but even for the lowest paying menial labor around here, i am at competition with 1000's of other people due to GM closing down and the general shitty economy around here. 

I spend Hours a day, filling out forms, interviewing and being told i'm not right for the position, or they found someone more qualified. Most of the time i hear nothing at all.

I have one two year old and another on the way, and it would be covered, but that would leave me limited time to work and support my family.

So

I've always got on really, caring and I've talked to her (and she's aware of the situation) numerous times about this. My Mum works part time, she quit her job when she we expecting my eldest, and for the first few years, was merely a housewife. Since she has held down a low part time job to help pay the bills.

&lt;b&gt; My Dad &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
Whereas my Dad is the main contributor to the family financially, but it's one of those jobs which are full on. He works practically all day, all week, he chooses his own hours at his office downtown. He is a funny, loving character. But due to his job, I really only see him in the evenings, and he's usually stressed so he seems to snap a lot. But he's one of those men he love in his own way, then he will send me loads of presents of that brand.

&lt;b&gt; My brother &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
And then going into my brother Robert, but he seems to (hate to put it this way) care for my Mum more, whenever there's an issue, it's always my Mum he goes to, when he stays overnight in a hospital, it's always her that stays. I'm not going to talk about the relationship me and my brother share, because its irrelevant, the best way to describe it for me (growing up) is an eleven year old in a mans body. He's not severe

&lt;b&gt; My Relationship with my Dad&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
When I was growing up, one on one, was when he took me to these exhibitions he liked. Those, are the only two memories I share with my Dad, for the last sixteen years. Oh, and he did drive me to rugby and back as a kid.

I feel, that he's never saying anything positive about me. He's always having a go at me for doing things, he's always saying succeed in life. He never opens a conversation with me, it's always me trying to make it. During the conversation, he's never continuing it on, he usually just gives one word answers. The usual Dad, from what I pick up, how you are etc. He just says 'hi.'  

We share A LOT of common interests, I see him at dinner, and I see him round the house, that is it. 

&lt;b&gt; His relationship with my brothers &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
He used to commonly collide with my eldest brother when he was a teen, so they get on really well. They talk about football a lot, for instance, but my brother is rarely in nowadays. He's either working, with his girlfriend, or out with his mates, he's not one for the 'quiet night in.'

Whereas my brother with autism, three hours before he's meant to, to say goodbye to Robert before he leaves in the morning. When my brother Robert gets halfway there, my Dad calls him to make sure everything is fine. At the end of my brothers day, my Dad takes his break to go and meet my brother (most days) by a local cafè for lunch. 

He's always talking to my brother, and I am invited, but it's never me deciding what we want to do.

If there's an issue with my brothers computer, he spends top dollar getting it fixed as soon as possible. Whereas for instance, my laptop which contains all my work is faulty and playing up when I need it for my GCSE's (seriously like DT.) He fixes it when he gets round to it, usually a week after the issue, if I ask for it to be sooner, then I'm labelled as wining and he won't do it. Now you tell me prioritise GCSE work &gt; playing games. Another example (this is no lie) my brother Robert says 'Hey Dad' and my Dad relplies with 'Hey how are you?' Then seconds later I say 'what's up Dad?' And he replies with 'for Godsake what is it?'

&lt;b&gt; Summary &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
I'm not going to lie to you Reddit, he expects it now, I'm jealous that somehow he can turn into a genuine Dad for my brother, but completely switches off for me. As I said, you may think I'm exaggerating, but I'm not, my eldest recognises it, my grandparents recognise it.

If you can't already tell, in his own type of way, but he is a dick to you.'

And that's true, not the ones aware) she always says how he sings praises for me. I know their really close, and she knows everything that's going on with me, even when I don't speak to her as much as I should.

My Mum actually mentioned it to him at one stage, and I would like any advice if possible. 

I hate to be that kid who's feeling sorry for themselves. In reality, gives it support, and loves them and is still very much involved. Whereas many, have lost their dear fathers, never knew them, or had abusive ones.

Final Point:
Lastly, as I said I've grown up with it. I appreciate he will demand a lot more, I'm just confused about how he shows so much open love for my brother, but not to me. This issue has been raised, so it's not like he's oblivious, but it feels like he's always snapping at me. I understand that I will come off as &lt;b&gt; very selfish &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; but without knowing the situation first hand, you wouldn't understand it fully I'm afraid. It's not a major issue, it's just an issue I would like to speak anonymously over the Internet about.

I resent him. I don't like feeling guilty when I am away. I don't like feeling obligated to be at home. I want to be free. I'm a 20 something bachelor. I don't intend to be married anytime soon largely because I want to enjoy freedom in my youth.

I want to pick up for the weekend and travel somewhere without having to pay a sitter $100. I want to stay at random places guilt-free whenever I want. 

I hate the shedding. I hate the neediness. 

That said, there's a 5% chance he will be aggressive with a stranger dog (though he is well socialized) - he would never hurt a person. HE LOVES PEOPLE; that's also a downside in a way, he is an attention *whore*.

Every time she's confronted on it she either lies about eventually going or goes on the defensive. These are some of the things she's said before:

- *""I am going to go

She has used this delaying tactic for years. She never goes

- *""You want me to go to the doctor because you want me to die. I know doctors

Here she relies on the superstition that if she doesn't go to the doctor

- *""I don't have the money. I'm not insured. I'll go broke and lose the house

She's not broke. Though she hasn't worked in years, it's just another excuse in the end.

For my summer break I have two options: 1) take intensive mandarin language courses over the summer

On the surface it look like an easy choice

My focus in graduate school is on international security and asian studies - specifically China. It is my hope (crosses fingers) that when I graduate in a year I can get a job with the US State Department as an Asian policy analyst. I've had numerous professors tell me that Chinese language skills are held as a premium within the State Department and the Intelligence Community. So that's one big + for the language program. I'd be developing a very important skill that I can build on during the school year w/ additional mandarin classes.

The internship at the consulting firm would help me break into the DC network (since DC is very much a relationship-based town). This will obviously help me down the line when I am looking for jobs. Plus, not asia. I'm not interested in border security exactly. Plus I wouldn't be developing any new skills, nor would I get any security clearance. 

I've been going back and forth on this for the past week

What will help me in my career the most (w/ an eye towards the State Department)? Will it be the network (which *could* enable me to break into DC and then move laterally to State at a later time) or the language skills (which would add significant points to my application at State

I’ve known my boyfriend’s sister, and so I put in a great deal of effort to be friendly to her because I knew it would mean a lot to him, and since they’re so close I knew that she would be a major part of my life, too.

With that being said, to include her in things, and invite her out—I have never received this in return. Our relationship was extremely one-sided from the start, and after the first year and a half of receiving nothing but the cold shoulder from her, her hobby of making me as uncomfortable as possible at every encounter, and her constant usage of mind games, I decided to back off. 

Another huge reason as to why I stepped away from her was because it got to the point that I would feel AWFUL being around her—even through text! My self esteem would plummet, but never ONCE have I ever had these feelings come over me before. Things have become even worse because she scrutinizes my every move, I feel sickeningly self conscious around her, and every move I make around her is apparently WRONG. I could do one thing, say, talk to her, and she’ll be upset. Suppose I don’t talk to her, and she’s furious with that, “Well

I’ve tried numerous times explaining to my boyfriend about how I feel, with the response usually being, “She DID that? Don’t take up for her, she’s a bitch!” My boyfriend also recently told me that she doesn’t have many friends despite people TRYING to be her friend because she enjoys whining to people about how she’s a loner. 

I wish I could just leave it at “Oh, too, leaves me overwhelmed and sick to my stomach. I know it’s extremely unhealthy for me to feel this way, but I honestly feel FURIOUS even when her name is brought up because I just can’t STAND the thought of her! It’s very apparent that she hates me, and it's also gotten to the point that, despite knowing that the rest of my boyfriend's family loves me, I'm beginning to feel unwelcome around them, just because she's over there.

Hi. First off
I've gotten closer in the past year with a girl, nor my boyfriend (he is also a good friend of hers and we met through her), nor any of our other mutual friends, have met them. I brushed it off as an inconvenience.
On my facebook news feed one of her statuses popped up

It got a little weird.

This friend had a friends list less than 60 (not that unusual, and vaguely looked like the same person. In some they aren't even the same people. Looking at the friends list, I quickly spotted some other ""friends"", and all of their accounts had a similar setup: from the area but Sara is the only mutual friend, friends lists never exceeding 50 or 60, professional profile pictures with only a vague resemblance to each other, etc. Plus, they are only friends with each other
I showed the accounts to my best friend (he is also very close with her) who was immediately suspicious and showed me apparent ""messages"" he had gotten from these friends in the past--who told him that he was being a poor friend to Sara and she deserved better treatment. We've agreed to not show or tell anyone else

It's not just that I'm weirded out by these really suspicious accounts
I feel she is lying to me about not just her relationships, or vice versa. I'd hate to break off the friendship, but I'm simply not comfortable hearing her say these things that I'm positive are lies.
I have other examples of her pretty outlandish stories outside of these friends

I'm 22 years old, but I know I want so much more from life. I strongly believe every person should follow whatever dreams they have and that the road to success is often littered with many failures. But I really just don't know what I'm doing anymore. I am watching some of my friends graduate, grow up, and I feel like I am here chasing the same things that I have been chasing since I was 13. 

In the same breathe I also feel like if I give up on the idea of being successful in music I will be a failure and that it will haunt me forever. When I hear so many inspirational people talk about their journey, I feel like my ""struggles"" are so minor. There are so many variables and it is more stress than I could have ever imagined. My days usually go one of two ways. I'm either incredibly happy to be creating music, finding other musicians, and glad to be taking part in the ""struggle"", or I contemplate the numerous amount of scenarios in which I end up working at a retail chain for life, with no college degree, as someone ""loser"" who is chasing a false hope.

I have never, how should I handle these stresses? Are they normal of young adult life, or is this something I need to sort out now? Should I consider going back home, going to school and giving up? Should I disregard all logic and keep pushing forward?

Here are the basic facts:

1. When I was in college the neighborhood high school girls used to hang out to be around my brothers (twins), so I don't presume that he is either just because of that. When my brothers left for the college, the girls still came around. Weird, but still only conjecture.

2. He's REALLY big into computer security. Not in a professional way. He's better than average but not quite a hobbyist in terms of technical knowledge. He's got three computers
    * 26-character passwords
    * encrypted drives
    * running arch-linux on one and slackware on the others

He doesn't know how to do all of this. He calls me all the time to help him with basic Linux support, do all of the security stuff and OS installation.

3. He definitely doesn't want anyone to know what he's downloading. He clears his browser history at every close

4. His hostname is error. I don't know if that's important

All I can do is speculate. I have no evidence

I know for a fact that he downloads music, but that seems like a lot of trouble to go through for music.

Hello Reddit. Me and my brother carry a burden. My stepdad is a pedophile. Im 20 years old he has been in my life since I was 10. I know he was a pedophile because when I was 15 he tried to molest me on two separate occasions he failed I pulled a knife on him i was a crazy 15 year old he never tried again. He had two daughters with my mom and because of my two little sisters I havent left home. Right now me and my brother of 23 who hasnt left home for the same reason are getting kicked out in two months. I think he is molesting one of my little sisters of 6 years old. Shes exhibiting signs of molestation one of them being that whenever she stays home alone with him she develops a urinary tract infection (me and my brother coordinate so they are almost never left alone with him but sometimes sadly life interferes). My mom gets mad at her for ""holding in her pee to much"" and has never connected the dots. Anyways I dont believe she would do anything if she knew the truth. When I told her about what he did to me she didnt believe me and she denies every incident of when he threatened to kill us the last incident being three years ago. I have a full ride scholarship to the biggest university in my state. The problem is that I would have to move away to take advantage of it. I turn to reddit because there is nobody I can trust with this secret because I have no real proof and no right to separate a man from his children without proof especially because my mom would not back me.

By the end of two weeks, the manager would call me up to help run the front counter since the other workers were quicker at getting orders out. My role became more of a ""floater"", covering for people who were on break.


While working at the counter, and figured that the tips were pooled since it was never addressed. I was wrong. Come pay day, I received just my wage.

After a heated discussion, he asked me to bring proof. He agreed it was unfair, but it was his parents' policy and they would need convincing. He assured me he was working on it.


The next day, and a calm tone to explain my case. When I walked in, the owner said he needed to speak to me. He told me I was no longer needed, as I was hired to be a prep cook and they found a better one.

Even worse is that I have a sister four years younger than me. She recieved all of the good genes, blonde, popular, bubbly, knows how to wear hair and makeup to her advantage. My parents love her. On the other hand, I have dull brown hair, don't know how to wear makeup/style my hair because my mom never showed me how, I have a dumpy frame

As soon as I could, they tear into me. Criticize me. Call me fat and ugly. I'm the butt of their jokes. They purposefully exlude me from family activities (leaving me at home, not telling me their plans, getting food for everyone except me). I basically drop time and miss work because I miss my family and they treat me like shit.

My sister treats me like shit now too. She joins in with them. She turned 18 and decided to become a stripper (only that, I take as much school as I can, they pay for my school) I had to drop a class because I didn't have time for it and it pushed my graduation date back a semester and they are really pissed about it. They criticize everything about my life.

I can't fucking stand it anymore. They are so awful to me. All I ever wanted was to just be in a family and be a daughter and have a mom and a dad that are proud of me. I try so hard. Last time I visited, they took a billion pictures of her with them and put it all over facebook and called her beautiful and said they had so much fun with her, etc. 

SO I'm sorry this is a wall of text. TLDR: My parents are assholes. Now THIS is what I need advice on: how should I act around my parents? How should I treat them? I love them so much

1) Ignore them when they try to reach out to me. Visit them as little as possible. Basically become a stone wall to them. Cut them out of my life. Give them as little details of my life as possible. For 22 years they have been so awful to me. They don't deserve to be in my life. They can go be a happy family with my sister

2) Be a fake person. Brush off their insults. Pretend like everything is okay. Be overly cheerful and happy so they feel like they have nothing to insult me over. Pretend that my life is sunshine and daisies so they can't find anything to criticize about me. Act like the perfect daughter even though I hate them

I don't know which option would be better for me in the long run. As far as maintaining family relationships go.

When I'm not travelling, things would somehow be better for her.

She can sometimes get into a real funk, and seems unable to make progress with her goals (her words). This is often intermingled with her expressing extreme dissatisfaction with her self-image. She expresses that she feels overly dependent on her parents for financial support, and this, combined with the other issues, often end (when she is in a funk) in long, spiraling self-denigrating, ever-worsening diatribes, desire for more friends

I try to provide a supportive ear, this conversation (for days at a time) is our only communication, though I try to add other positive messages, and push things to a more positive direction. But, I feel sometimes that I'm actually enabling this, or that, somehow I am failing her, organizing something - not personal issues

In fact, and ask for a subject change, which I am unable to provide, because I feel emotionally wrapped up in what she has said, and don't really know how to follow up.

When I asked her if she liked anyone she said she thought this guy was kinda cute, but wasn't definitive on whether or not she actually had a crush on him.  I'm not sure if I should risk ruining our friendship by telling her given these other factors, and the fact that it's highly likely I'm ""friendzoned"", which might cause her to turn me down.

I used to attend a church, so the girls group stayed very young. 

The ""leader"" of our group was a kind of ""special"" woman. We'll call her Crystal from here on out. Crystal wasn't exactly normal. She was about forty years old, and had been in over twenty car accidents. Her parents are wealthy, so they just kept buying her way into college, and getting her new vehicles. It wasn't polite to talk about, so no one really knows what's wrong with Crystal. All we really know is that she's about as mature as a 15 year old girl, and that she has more learning disabilities/social impairments than any of us have fingers.

Crystal would regularly have the girls group at her parents house, sleepovers, dress up parties, ect.) Crystal, as previously mentioned, lives with her parents. I don't recall ever meeting her mother, but every time there was a girls event

Crystals father was socially awkward

Being a young girl, all of them being of a flirtatious nature. I'm not entirely sure why that never raised any red flags for any of us.

*Fast forward six years*.

The girls that I went to girls group with are all grown up and adults. I still keep in contact with three of them

One of the girls, but she was so beautiful he knew that she wouldn't be interested in an old man like him. He spoke of how she used to sit on the couch in the living room and do her homework, and how he wished he were brave enough to approach her. (Keep in mind that Carly was fifteen the last time she went to an event at his house.) At the end of the message, he asks Carly if she would be interested in ""getting together sometime"". Carly is 18, so this message is legal. Nevertheless, he's confessing that he had fantasies about a girl between the ages of 11 and 15 years old. 

Carly shares the email with me, but none of us have proof. Furthermore, the majority of our group hasn't been to the church in years. Two of us are known atheists, and the other two had a falling out with church staff. By which, I mean, we could tell the church what we experienced as kids, but they wouldn't really believe us.

We sent a screenshot of the email to them, and we felt that underage girls weren't safe there. 

The church spoke to Crystals father. He insisted that his account had been hacked

None of us really know what to do at this point. We don't know any of the girls that attend the girls group

Are we overreacting? What are our options?

Into my story. 
Highschool sucks. Especially when your highschool is filled with cliques and backstabbing, if you try, people talk behind your back and make fun of you for it. I've always been a bit of a loner, the girl who could make friends but can't keep them. When I met Ella, my best friend had left me, and I had no one. As we were both smart and she was alone as well, we became friends quickly. I didn't look farther than skin deep into her character as, one friend is better than none. Ella, REALLY nice, but I had no one to tell. I laughed it off to stop the pain. But Ella wasn't joking.
""You'd have no friends if you didn't have me.""
""Seriously, athletic, and about 120 pounds. Not terrible)
""Your sense of fashion sucks. All your clothes look like garbage.""
""You're the dumbest person in the grade.""
""Dumbass and fatass
""Dumbass. You don't even know what that means
""Dumbass. Loser. Fatty. You have no friends.""
""Can you put your hair in front of your face so I don't have to look at your warts (moles) all the time?""
""I can't believe a guy likes you. There's nothing to like.""
""You're so fugly
It started being an everyday thing, the girl I consider my best friend, ready to put me down for anything. It doesn't stop, even when I told her to quit it. 
I have no shoulder to cry on, ill have no one. If I keep being friends with her, the worse my life will get. Please, to anyone out there, if there's any advice you can give, I'd really appreciate it. Please, I feel lost and hurt and dead inside. Even if its just to say tough it out

He called me over. He asked me where I was from, I thought he was some kind of salesmen and was gathering data. I thought this because I noticed some medicine bottles on the AHT. Then things got scary.

He basically got in my face and violently told me how I disrespected them by looking at his girl

I tried apologizing

At this point I was very scared. I honestly didn't look at them. And I started wondering why no one was helping me. Then he said something

I told him how I lost my father. Then he started crying about the hurt and how it felt. Next thing I knew we where crying in each others arms. Luckily for me

As we where baawing in each others arms. He was saying right in my ear how my dad is always looking out for me

He took out his wallet asking if I was going to see a movie. I put my hand up saying ""no thank you"". But he told me that now wasn't the time to show pride.

He wanted to give me his phone number and email address. Because apparently he wanted to be a father figure. And his number was so that he could ""back me up"" whenever I needed him.

About 2 months ago, I had a huge argument with the delivery guy and I spoke to the store manager and threatened not to buy from them again and they ended up saying ""keep this pizza. We will not charge you anything"" and I did, but I've never ordered by phone again to that address for fear of what I think may have happened today. Fast forward a few weeks, I went to the store which is just around from my work and I ordered a pizza and had it inside the store. As I'm about to leave the store, the driver I had the argument with is about to come in and he looks at me, recognizes me and puts sort of an evil grin and continues walking. So today I went there again and ordered the usual pizza and I a slice and underneath the tomato there is this gooey substance all over the base of the pizza. The taste is not clear, but the texture that stays in the mouth is very very similar to sperm (Don't ask.)

Now, onion, pineapple and double-chicken and I can tell the taste and texture today could very easily be misguided by cum. I've kept the remaining slices of the pizza and I'm sort of curious to know if there is anything I can do to confirm if there was any substance in my pizza that shouldn't be there and if so how/where. In fairness, the situation is a bit complicated as I don't want to speak to anyone of my family/friends that I may have tasted someone else's sperm, as it'd be awkward to explain how I know the texture. I also don't know what type of laboratory would be able to assist me in finding out if my fears are right (if this is possible at all).

So when they get in a fix, and full on tantrums from the obese 50-year-old woman she is. When I try to intervene, my grandmother accuses me of being heartless and my mother accuses me of ingratitude (which is hilarious since her only contribution to my rearing was giving birth to me). Ultimately when she does lend them money, she never gets it back and winds up regretting it because she barely has enough money to live on herself. But then a month or so passes and the cycle begins anew.

I want these people out of my life, and their selfish dramatic displays are taxing on my grandmother's health. I'm just afraid that taking action will only either stress her worse or cause her to hate me.

There was a lot of drinking and there were a lot of minors at this party, but not all of them) and wound up at the hospital with a 0.37 BAC. She had to talk to the administration at her college about this incident and named the house owner as the person who invited her and pressured her to drink/gave her drinks. 

This guy that she blamed is employed through the college and the organization that he is employed through is under administrative investigation because of an incident that happened before his employment began, mostly related to underaged drinking happening on his watch. They basically told him today that they are going to assume that he is responsible for this incident and terminate his employment unless the truly responsible party is revealed (they think that he's covering for someone but also they have been using him as scapegoat because of his record). 

I don't know what to do. I am much more responsible than him for all of this and my employment is not on the line. I find it wrong and unjust that they are blaming him for something for which he isn't really responsible. I have given my contact information to his boss and asked his boss to share this information with the administration and he told me that they would be in contact tomorrow (the guy told me that his boss would be the best avenue to get the admin my contact info). 

What is the best way to approach my conversation with the admin? What is the worst case scenario? How will my punishment change as a result of this girl being 17 instead of a legal adult? This guy who is being stuck with the blame right now refuses to incriminate anyone even at the expense of his own job and lifestyle and I want to protect him from this wrongful blame. How can I do this best? I really need some advice.

**TLDR**: A friend is being blamed for something that is my fault and now his employer is threatening to terminate his contract. I am intervening tomorrow but don't really know the best way to intervene.

**UPDATE**: I talked to the administration today and they said that they were withdrawing a recommendation for punishment against the guy whose house the party was at. The admin guy thanked me for coming forward and claiming responsibility and said that I should be more careful to not drink with minors in the future but that everyone is just glad that the drunk girl survived and they will be closing the investigation before Thanksgiving.

So the other day, I usually wind up dreading the conversation part of the experience.

I'm not good at small talk, but I usually wind up trying to do so, because I worry that I'm being rude otherwise.

This time, though that's not her name) and I seemed to hit it off really well. We were chatting the entire time she was working on my hair (which took over an hour, if not closer to two), making jokes and talking about similar interests and our differences (we come from somewhat different backgrounds, which I always find interesting). She had a great sense of humor and I found myself laughing a lot, and she seemed to appreciate my sense of humor, too.

It's possible that she's like that with everyone and it's also possible that her laughter was polite (though it seemed genuine to me), who was sitting two chairs down from us, even commented to the woman cutting her hair that I don't usually like talking to people in general, let alone as much as Sarah and I were talking.

I love my wife, so she joined our conversation for the last 20 minutes or so, and she liked Sarah too and could see that we seemed to get along really well. My wife and I talked about my lack of local friends last night, and this afternoon she told me that she had considered stopping by the beauty school earlier today to talk to Sarah herself and invite her and her fiance over sometime, but she wasn't sure how I'd feel about it and decided against doing so until checking with me first.

But we're both kind of socially awkward and neither one of us knows if this is just a completely idiotic thing to be even thinking about, or if she just happens to be the type of person who can not only talk to anyone, but anyone can talk to, as well, despite my usual conversational ineptitude.

I also realize that one good conversation isn't necessarily a clear indication of how well two people will get along, I guess.

I suppose my question is this - is there something either I or my wife could or even should do? Other than trying to make friends elsewhere?

Despite the contract also being ""no refunds"", we can minimize depreciation to market value of the phone.

In return I will refund you the original sale price minus the ebay and paypal fees ($24.50)

Thank you

**His response**

I will package up 
Monday afternoon when I return and send them back to USPS mail with delivery confirmation thank you  I will post positive feedback when I receive the refund and ask you do the same

**AND THEN

Good morning  I just stopped at a cellular store hear in mobile  they will trade e a refurbished phone for 100 bucks  would you be willing to split that cost with me and then we can end this happily  I saw in one other communication you mentioned a paypal cash refund I just didn't know the amount  I have not been carrying or using the phone in order to preserve the condition  this option may suit us both the best  let me knw

**WTF???**

**UPDATE: My response**

Hi XXXX

I thought an agreement had been made but you have continued to renegotiate and change the terms. I am very uneasy about what your motives are now in this transaction. You have already verified that the phone is functional and you have been using it. You have also registered the ESN with Verizon which means I am no longer in fact the owner of this device

The terms of the sale were ""no refunds"". You have received and signed for a fully operational phone with a new battery and case

I would ask that you keep the phone and do with it what you wish. You can sell it, since you have confirmed that it does in fact, work.

If you are unsatisfied with this then you have every right to proceed as you wish and I will provide the necessary proof and documents to Ebay and Paypal.

Once again I apologize

Thank you

This summer, and began talking with several different people about potentially sharing an apartment/townhouse with them. I spoke with each of them for over a week before deciding who I wanted to room with. Once deciding, my future roommate and I talked for almost two months nearly every day, getting to know each other. He seemed like a cool guy with very similar opinions and interests. 

However, or the way that he had told me he was. He turns every little thing into a full-blown argument, and refuses to ever accept responsibility for the smallest things. He bitches about the littlest things all the time. He never does his fair share of the housework, constantly leaving out his dirty clothes/plates/trash, etc for days. He is constantly one-upping everyone, yet rarely can back up his claims. If he disagrees with anything someone says/states, he gets an *extremely* harsh and/or condescending tone and begins to curse at you and act like you're an idiot, he either just tells you to ""shut the fuck up"" or refuses to believe it altogether. Frankly, and closed-minded.  

I am an extremely introverted person, he does apologize and promise to try and work on it, but it goes right back to the way it was the following day. I realize that I am not perfect, either, but I have tried to make concessions and work with him, because I know it can be tough to be around another person pretty much 24/7, but the give has to go both ways.

Significant background:

* I've worked at my company for almost 10 years. Last year I applied for a promotion at a store 2 miles from my house. Got the promo, and I don't know all of the answers.

* I have an assistant who is also brand new to the job, and one of my tasks was to get her trained to take over a position on my level within 6months. 

* I have worked for almost 7 out of the past 13 months without an immediate superior who, help, direct, delegate etc. Someone had filled the position in February, but she works in our corporate offices 2 days (soon to be 3) out of every week. In my job performance failings (mentioned below) I had constantly asked her for help in how to improve, to which she shrugged her shoulders numerous times. 

* Two weeks ago, offering me a voluntary demotion, or transferring me to a store 1.5 hours away from my house. 

* This was the first time I had been sat down and told of my myriad shortcomings. I had no idea that this type of conversation was on the horizon. Admittedly I knew I was falling short in some areas, though it was never granted me due to payroll constraints. 

* (7/23) In our next meeting, as I am very hardworking, dedicated, and ready to take on the job (in my current store) with the fine-tuning that I need to succeed and otherwise I would be set up for failure. I indicated that if the company did not see fit to accommodate these requests, they would have to fire me.
* At this point, and that since I refused to move, they would be firing me later in the week. 

* Friday 7/26 at 4pm I still hadn't heard anything

* Since all of this has transpired, I registered for college full time, and started looking for internships. Now it sounds like the company higher-ups are backpedaling. I feel that my DM spoke out of turn when he told me I would be fired. I have no intention of quitting (I want to collect unemployment until I find another job/internship, and to do this I must be fired) Now I worry that in my meeting with HR on Monday, they will say that they are not going to fire me, even though my subsequent actions were entirely based on taking my District Manager at face value, and acting as a person whose job was no longer viable. 

* P.S. All conversations (with the exception of the first one--I was totally blindsided by it) have been recorded in accordance with NYS wiretapping/recorded conversation law. 

* Do I have a case to demand termination? I have already made plans for myself with the understanding that I was effectively fired. I have worked too long and too hard to kowtow to a company that so clearly sees me as expendable after almost a decade of dedicated service. I now feel it is time to get my life in order

As the title says, and none of my expectations were met. My labmates are nice, but my boss/PI is NOTHING like what he was when I visited the school and how he was through email correspondence.. 

I guess my biggest problem last week was that I expected too much, and I was in lab for about 13 hours each day my first week.


Now I've had the weekend to recover, the things I'm learning and doing are really interesting and I got home at a decent hour, and I felt good. Then I found out that night that there were a bunch of things I was supposed to have prepared for today (Tuesday) that no one had previously told me about. My boss/PI here has not communicated with me more than a couple of words since I got here.. and it makes me crazy. Along with that, I'm expected to know everything right away, with no previous teaching/observing, and every night I go to sleep and every day I wake up and think, ""what will I be expected to do today?"" and the answer (or lack thereof) makes me so nervous I feel nauseated.


So then during my free minutes throughout the day, some whatever. I feel so miserable here.

This is gonna be a very long post

I am 20 years old and I am currently on the 1st year of Software Engineering college. I live in Serbia.
Recently, being that a big percentage of programmers are self-taught. 
At the time
A couple of days ago, and that I might be able to take advantage of that. They told me that being a Serbian interpreter is a well-paid job, and that I should seriously consider looking for a job like that in UK or US, and if I found it, that I should accept it and move.

A little digression: I love English. It's been my passion ever since I was 7 years old and it still is. I wanted to pursue a career in English and wanted to study it

Moving on: At first I took their advice as a joke, I couldn't stop thinking about it, so I decided to sate my curiosity by simply looking for job offers.
I was amazed by what I found - There were so many jobs, after paying for rent, food, transportation and other expenses. That's when I started seriously pondering the idea of actually applying for such a job and moving away if I got the position.

My idea was: If I could work as an interpreter, while dong something I love and making enough money for a living, plus enough to start saving up for my own place at some point.

So, should I go through with it? Also, if yes, how should I break the news to my family, being that they are very conservative and were always against the idea of me leaving the country (also they'd be against the idea to quit college since the college diploma means everything to them).

The problem is, other than my boss, and the room has no windows. I was not told at the interviews that I would be working in the basement (I saw two open areas of cubicles and large offices with floor-to-ceiling windows), and I feel like they avoided telling me that for a reason.

I know I should be ecstatic to have a job (and I am)

When would it be appropriate to bring this general topic up with my boss/HR? I'm afraid it will affect my work and my usually upbeat disposition. Should I just suck it up? Clearly I will, and I don't know how he does it. I'm considering buying a natural light lamp, and it's only my fifth day tomorrow. It's really disorienting; we had a torrential rainstorm in my drought-ridden area for hours on Tuesday, and I didn't even know until I went to the kitchen for some water. First world problems, eh.

1373600199.0,1i4pie,I Cut Contact With The Most Important Person of My Life Today. How Can I Cope?,Fim0458,8,2,5,"This might be a long one

It all started 3 years and 6 months ago, i like to play video games and talk to my friends, that's about it, I have 3 main friends. My friend Jake, who i spend most of my gaming time with we played all major games and releases and spoke to each other about them, but we have very different personalities. and 2 friends I only know through World of Warcraft I only know as Az and Fee. who i talk to a lot of the time about personal things.

So i'm on World of Warcraft

They seem very vocal and start talking about how they're new to the game but had always wanted to play, currently I'm male, but i'm hoping to come out to my parents soon and get treatment to become a woman."" and that gets everyones attention.

They start asking all kinds of questions, but i felt bad, so i whisper her (Like a PM for anyone unfirmiliar) and say ""Hey, they aren't getting too much for you are they? you seem like a nice person, they're just interested, don't feel scared or anything!"" then we get talking for a bit in private about all sorts of things, one topic becomes another, and our experiences in them

Things like this continued for about 4 months, and the name kinda stuck, we were talking one day about all the things she had to go through to actually physically become a woman, and the more and more i learned about it over the course of these 5 months, the more and more it fascinated me.. and this day, i remember it vividly. we were leveling in thousand needles. and just before she went offline, i figured out the reason it fascinated me so much was because i felt the same way! i proceeded to tell her this and she said to me ""wow.. really? you're sure about this Fim? i think you should sleep on it and see how you feel tomorrow."" (it was 3am at the time), i felt the same the morning after. that was the day i figured out i was trans.

A couple months after that, I'd been telling her every time she brought it up that she needed to tell her mother or else she wouldn't get proper treatment while her male puberty was still reversable (we're only 10 months apart, she's 10 months older than me.) and she ended up telling her mother after that, and she came back to me after it all went down, and the first thing she said was ""I could kiss you right now!""

Then another couple months later, I maybe said to her what might have been the most awkward way to ask someone out ever! i said to her ""You know, in the future, i think i can see us being a couple!"" and she said ""Yeah! i can see that too!""  and she said ""Do you think you would like that? i would!"" and i said ""Yes! ofcourse i would"" followed by ""How would you like it to be sooner, not in the future, like, today

After that we were lovers for 2 years and 7 months. and up untill 2 years and 2 months into that, we started arguing a lot more about pointless shit, meaningless crap, like why i wouldn't help her in a game, or why she missed a raid or something, stuff we had no reason to argue about, and she felt trapped because i was being clingy, but i never caught onto the fact that i was being clingy. i fixed the arguing though. and to celebrate, for 3 days. from where i live on the isle of wight. these were the happiest 3 days of my life, and in general spoke as well as we always had online

We managed to make it another 2 months after that, so whats the point?"" calling that as obvious bullshit i followed up on it, and we got into the first argument we'd had in 2 months. and she stops talking to me for the night, the day later, she broke up with me..

I didn't see that coming.. at all, and i still loved her with every ounce of my being. so after this.. we stopped talking for a week then got back in contact. and we start talking almost half as good as we did before, sorta forcing conversations, not having interesting things to talk about. but something was different.

Last week i figured out what was different, if i never made an effort to talk to her, we'd never talk. on top of that, she'd still been acting as good as ever to all her other friends. and i felt upset by that.

So today, it ended up with us cutting contact. we aren't talking any more. but i feel like this is unavoidable. and even with that said, i wish we'd ended it when we werent on a sour note, if you really want, you can read the full conversation here. http://imgur.com/a/CyTYx (she decided her name was going to be Fae, and i chose mine as Felicia.)

And now.. it feels like I've had a part of me ripped out. like life has no point. i don't feel.. depressed or anything like that

And these thoughts make me feel terrible.,throwaway54641,8,3,13,"I am using a throwaway because a lot of my friends use reddit. And I want to be clear that I feel absolutely awful writing this. I am in my 30's and single so I am sure I have my issues. I think I need someone to knock me down a few notches.

I am a woman. A programmer. I was lucky to have a job before finishing college. I have always loved science and culture. I have traveled a lot. I have a lot of hobbies and I love the outdoors and exercise. I don't get a lot of support besides from my awesome work colleagues. They are every reason I love coming to work and I believe they love working with me.

I have no idea how I turned out how I did. I feel that I am very different from others in my family. We don't really connect anymore. They work hard at their jobs and not much else. I have a sister who is a waitress. My Mom has told me many times now that if I would ""drop the weird science thing"" men would like me more. If politics come up any time the weekend would be considered ruined. I worked before college making an hourly wage in a job I didn't care for and my parents repeatably told me to think about what I was doing when I quit to pursue a computer science degree. I paid for college myself. I don't ever ask for anything from my family. I show

My friends are a different story. They are good friends. They are always there when I need them for a happy hour or a ride to the airport. They are just...simple. Every weekend revolves around drinking in some way. I feel like they don't try at anything else. I got into hiking heavily last year and at one point they wanted to join me. But every weekend when push came to shove they had some excuse. Several times I felt like I was being tricked. We would plan an epic overnighter I was way too excited for and the night before they would call up everytime

A few of us met in college. Everyone has a job but often I feel everyone is capable of doing better even in this economy. One was a teacher. She said she decided to quit because it didn't pay well. But she is a barista now. I often hope she is just saying that to save face because she was fired

None of them have passports. None of them have ever traveled. A few use money as an excuse but they have no problem taking on large car payments or opting to live in an expensive neighborhood even though they have to commute further to work. And many make a lot of trips to Vegas or Hawaii. But no one has left the USA. 

Even my roommates drive me nuts. They just watch TV all day. If something is too hard

So I am starting to resent everyone around me. I hate going home. I cringe when I get a text and hope it isn't a friend (I am the worst friend in the world). I am working later everyday because that is the only place I feel challenged. I have been teaching myself some chemistry at work and I picked up some spectroscopy gear. This is the first time I have told anyone. If I tell my friends or family they will just ruin this new subject I have discovered. 

I have started dating someone new who is very smart and from a different culture. I am too embarrassed to introduce him to my friends. I don't know how to talk to him about it. I am starting to worry that the not introducing him to anyone I know besides some colleagues will make him think I am not interested in him. I am also worried about how my friends will react. I can see them freaking out a little. 

I am not that smart so I know my attitude isn't fair. I often think about just walking away from everyone and burning all of the bridges

I am a shy and nervous person so friends have never come easily anyway. I want to move and look for new places to live often but my area is very expensive and it can be tough to find a place this close to work. I want more than anything for the friends of the guy I am seeing to accept me since they are all so smart but they are all guys and I know it is important for me to have my own friends. I just want to be challenged and I want support to be a better person.  

I do meetups and have been to a few local science societies. I also go to city council meetings. I love finding people to discuss the things I am passionate about. But they are always very old or students there for extra credit. All my colleagues are either very old or just really involved with their families so while we go out for beers from time to time or comment on FB posts we aren't close. It would mean the world to me to meet people my age who like to talk about politics

I want to say the rant helped but it didn't. I just feel disappointed by everyone I know. And that isn't fair to them because they are good people and if they are happy how they are there is no reason they should change. But I am growing bitter. I hate to say it

Hello :) 
So. I can't really explain it. I'm a senior computer science major so a social life is already quite rough to maintain. In the past year I guess you could say I finally ""blossomed"" into a pretty cute girl. As a result of this, a job, and my depression, I guess you can say I've become content or settled into a life where I honestly do absolutely nothing. I'm on reddit, tumblr, and Netflix all day long. If someone were to talk to me about shows and movies I can go on for hours and I seem like the coolest cat. But as soon as hobbies, interests and what I do on my ""free time"" comes up in conversation with a guy I'm talking to, read, but I feel like the way I talk about these things just makes me sound so boring and plain.

We stopped talking for a month and I relapsed and contacted her on Facebook. I went full retard and spilled my guts. She said that she had moved on. I was teary eyed and begged for an honest explanation ; I said I needed something not vague to leave on. She said that I was a wonderful boyfriend, but I just wish I hadn't exposed myself like that. The conversation got kind of bad after I asked her if it was all really that bad, since she seemed to get over so quick. She said yes, followed by incessant ""lol"". I tried to recover a friendly tone, but failed. 


And then last night. There was a smallish anime convention in our town and we had both attended years prior, and friends. I wave and kindly say Hi, in hopes of assuring no hard feelings. The response was an awkward wave from her and pretty derp tension. I'm not one for PDA's, but during our relationship, I reassured her I was not embarrassed of her, I just do not like it, but we would still kiss and holds hands in public just not very often.

My sister hasn't spoken to my mom or myself in over 2 months. I'm very upset and worried for her (she was molested as a child by a fellow church member -- we're all atheists now except my mom) because of her past. I've always been her big brother. I've always been there for her and so has my mom. 

* What I think:

My sister seems to be upset because I was laid off work and am currently relying on unemployment to make ends meet and that my mom MIGHT lose her job because her union doesn't seem to want to represent the workers that are being mistreated (my mom stands up for herself and her co-workers as opposed to many others). I'm currently working a side business that is beginning to generate enough revenue to make my full-time job in the near future and the possibility that my mom will get fired is relatively low.

I have tried talking with him about this, and I understand that he sort of reacts in the moment, and then rides out the feelings, and once the moment has passed, he is over it. I try talking to him about being the bigger person and letting things go, but he seems to feel like he has a lot of things figured out and doesn't want to listen to anything I say. Once or twice there has been a breakthrough of sorts




This all being the case, but I just can't go through life attached to someone who pushes everyone away from us. But I have only lived in this state for 3 or 4 months, and everyone I know I know only because of him. What should I do? I am considering hitchhiking to my homestate (haven't been back in 4 years), I have family and friends there. But I am scared. I have no money, no friends.. I knew this was a risk in moving here with someone who, relatively, I only recently met. I just couldn't imagine that we would be going our separate ways so soon. But I am strong and I know I will end up fine. I just need some advice. 




Should I stay with him, but I don't want to get raped or murdered. Is it true that some churches by greyhound tickets for people trying to get home? Is leaving on my own too risky?

I'm 18

Her mother is purely emotionally abusive. She has her convinced that she's obese for a Filipino, drawings, clothes, the bracelets she uses to cover her cutter scars, etc. She hates her because she became pregnant during college and couldn't continue her education. They blame her for that. 

Her father is emotionally, hit her with a board of plywood, and has even had a knife at her throat. He has her convinced she's a horrible person, and tries to make her believe it's her fault he raped her.

I know she needs to get out, only that it made things much worse. I've developed the theory that she was raped after calling CPS, which is why he blames her. I've spoken to her about it, but she refuses to speak to them again. 

She also refuses to go to the cops. I imagine that's related to her refusal to talk to CPS. It doesn't help that her uncle is a less-than-good cop in our area.

She also refuses to run away and leave her 4 teen-preteen brothers behind. They aren't abused. She also refuses to tell me why she is so steadfast in her refusal to leave. 

She always tells me that ""It's fine."" Or ""I'm okay."" But being beaten and abused nearly daily isn't my definition of ""fine"" or ""okay.""

I want to get her out of there. I want to save her. But I don't know how because she won't tell me why she won't leave.

This all starts back on Back on Wednesday, just finished his class for the semester and decided to party. No big deal. I go to work the next morning, finish my day and then head home.  I find out DA is still drinking, a little crazy but fine. I have known DA likes to party pretty hard but, it really has never been that big of an issue, till now.....

On Thursday DA continues the drink-a-thon

On Friday I wake up go to work and come home. I find out DA has bough Xannax, I'm like ""WHAT THE FUCK!!!!!!""  He says, ""your window is making me cold.""  Are you fucking serious!  I'm calling bullshit. 

Later on Sunday, ""either roommate #1 or myself had stolen some of his Xannax.""  We are like ""Nope, didn't touch 'em.""  He goes on to claim that we took them and he knows it and he is watching us. This has happened before, he takes sooo many that he ""blacks-out"" and forgets that he takes them himself. Then he blames it on whomever is closest.  Fine, whatever.  

I wake up Monday hoping all the shenanigans are done, the party is over.  I continue on with my day.  I come home to find an absolutely comatose DA.  I didn't know what was entirely going on but I thought he was just recovering.  I come into his room to wake him up because the night prior he woke me up at 4 am with his drunken shenanigans.  I see something chopped up into a ""line"" with a dollar bill ready to be snorted on his computer desk.  ""WTF is that,"" I think to myself. So this is shit where shit gets out of hand.

Tuesday morning

I turn on the light to his room, I presume it was vomit.  The idea behind it makes me sick.  I start gagging all over.  Think I myself am about to vomit.  Roommate #2 hears the commotion and comes out.  He sees the situation and instructs DA to spit it out.  DA makes it through.  I get him some water then I go to work with all the mornings events on my mind.

I have been thinking of this morning all day.  I can't get it out of my mind.  I am almost positive I just saw my roommate and longtime friend stare at death this morning.  Around 2 p.m. Tuesday I give DA a call to check up on.  He says that he is done and that was horrible.  He needs to chill out. THANK GOD x 2. It does not last.

I come home Tuesday evening to find out that DA has been getting his party on, ""you're out of fucking control.  You need to chill the fuck out.""  He agrees, mostly likely that the drugs agree.  I asked him if he was doing MDMA last night as well.  He tells me that it was not.  That in fact it was heroin......

""HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!!""  Heroin, but dabbled in some other things, but heroin is the next fucking level.  I go to work Wednesday and come home to a recovering DA.  He relaxes while watching some tv shows.  THANK GOD x 3.  Tells me that he is going to get back to normal.  

I wake up Wednesday morning with the past week weighing heavy on me.  I like my friend

I go to work Thursday still thinking of the past week.  I am going through my day of work and I get a message from a friend that DA wanted him to pick up a 6 pack for him.  Friend says

DA is currently shitfaced passed out in his room rocking out to some Queen, back with my parents if need be.  Try and talk to DA but if he just shrugs it off his shoulders so be it and continue on with my life.

The other day my dad told my mum he didn't love her any more and so left. It was sudden and very shocking. I'm 21 and I have two younger brothers. My parents have 11 years left on the mortgage and my dad said he would pay it all off (plus bills) but now I am unsure with all the things that have come to light.

It turned out my dad had met another lady through a court case that involved my dad being witness to her husband beating her. My dad testified but nothing happened. This was a year ago....

He has been seeing her for the year. That a long time to lie. Christmas's

He also had a planned trip to Germany for work related stuff...

This is where is gets nasty. Turns out that in fact the Germany trip for work is actually a family holiday with his new gf and her children to Switzerland... Tuesdays he spent at hers.. and Thursdays he told work he was working from home but was actually at hers...

My dad is now angry and I am concerned for my mum and brothers. I don't earn enough to pay a mortgage and nor does my mum. I don't want to move as I don't like change. This whole thing is just getting to me. I am lost. While he is not my biological father he was there 21 years of my life and it feels like hes abandoning us.

1367469450.0,1dj7bm,30 year old overwhelmed by (programming) career path thinking of taking a step backwards,nottooshure,5,0,0,"I went to school

I've never been the type that cared if some complicated method of doing things was slightly more efficient than the way I understood how to do it if there were no noticeable difference in performance. I've never cared about a lot of the nitpicking you see from programmers on best-practice protocols as long as they don't interfere with what I'm doing. I've never responded to a programming thread with a clever solution just for fun. I've never read a programming book outside of college. I get frustrated by having to do the dirty work of converting data types and dealing with the fact that there's oftentimes no built-in solutions to seemingly common problems in higher level languages. Or being up-to-date on the most recent CSS rules applicable to different browsers. Etc

Basically I have just never cared about coding

Now, especially with libraries out there that do a lot of the dirty work that core languages don't do - So my gameplan is to focus on this, what I love and create software that I want.

The problem is - What kind of jobs out there would allow me to work

Here's my ideas so far:
Cook
Part-time at a call center 
Janitor 
night shift stocking shelves at a department/grocery store 
garbage man 

Some other considerations I have are:
-Would prefer a semi active job but not overly demanding
-My pride as a 30 year old man that's already spent 6+ years working low-end jobs not wanting to bump into high school friends serving them french fries at a mcdonald's drive thru window in their mercedes (I know
-Not a fan of working with the public in general
-I don't mind working any hours(days, would prefer working long hours for few days vs few hrs in many days for transportation reasons and I have much better focus when I dont have to worry about working on a given day
-I'm kinda introverted so I get emotionally drained (not good for getting work done after)
-I'm not a tough guy (ie no security guard/bouncer jobs)
-ideally looking to make 25%+ more than minimum wage at a minimum
-trying to get paid as much as possible for as little time/brain power commitment as possible but i'm not afraid of working hard
-I live in a city of roughly 100k population in Canada (Don't want to get too specific for privacy reasons)

About a month ago my wife and I went out on a date, when we have sex its amazing, but the frequency felt short. I've always wanted more and this seemed like a way to get more, plus one of the terms we agreed on was that things would be more frequent in our bedroom together.

The following day she spoke to me about it a little further, and after we had discussed all of this we had a very wild night ourselves. Everything was great.....until I woke up the next day.

The details of what she told me proceeded to eat me up while I was at work

The following day we both agree to make dating profiles and see what we can fish up. Lo and behold the online dating world is full of men, the first guy has since stopped talking to her after their first meeting, so at this point he is out of the picture.

Anyways, I am not a complete wreck when I know she is meeting up with someone and I am generally turned on by the whole idea.

Here's the kicker however

So here we are, her words. Meanwhile I have giving up on the online dating as I haven't gotten any messages back. I've deleted my profile as I am just frustrated with the whole idea of it. I don't even know how I feel about things anymore, after her meetings she comes home and rocks my world and I love it. But once the high is over and I wake up I feel inadequate or second best. I've tried explaining to this to her, but it always erupts into a fight. She claims I rock her world and she will never leave me and loves me, and I want to believe her, I just struggle with it. I don't want to feel like this, I want to have that self confidence, I do feel closer to her....but there is just something that I can't put my finger on that creeps up out of the dark and puts me in a funk and ruins everything.

Last summer, it did not work as my mum discovered that as long as you took tiny sips of alcohol then it did not trigger the drug. Then, our insurance cover ended.

It is now a year later and she was doing pretty well. Not completely sober but not a mess either - it was bareable. Not anymore. She drinks from the moment she gets home to the moment she goes to bed and she often refuses to eat. My Dad and I know all of the hiding places for her vodka so we regularly find it when we suspect she's been drinking - and if you live with an alcoholic for so long, leaving myself in the house a lot with my mum. If she goes to the toilet, i quickly go and find her alcohol and pour it down the sink. It used to be that she'd apologise a lot if i caught her, now it's the opposite - she blames me and says i'm a horrible person for doing that to her. Tonight alone, I have been told that it'll be my fault if she and my Dad get divorced; that I'm the reason our family life sucks; that she can't wait for me to leave for America (I leave in 7 weeks and will be gone for 10 weeks); that I act so superior to her even though I'm not; and that I'm no better because I used to be bulimic (little does she know that my bulimia is back, stronger than ever due to the stress she puts me through).

What do I do? I love her so much, but i don't have the time for it. I just want her to get better and fight her addiction.

1365369451.0,1bvhl2,I found out my best friend is gay.,IAmA_TerriblePerson,6,1,21,"So this post will be me half-ranting/half-asking how I should approach the subject matter...

I realized my best friend/guy I've loved for the past two years

My first suspicion arose around october, he would chat with him constantly, even while we were going on dates and such. I shrugged it off, though, as maybe he was just getting to be good friends with him. 

When we flew back home from uni (we live in the same home town) I got to meet this guy. My second suspicion came when I would leave with other friends to buy drinks and such and when we'd return they'd have gone ""for a walk"". A would tell me that his guyfriend was stressed because he was going through a rough patch with the girl he was seeing. This lowered my suspicious a bit

The third hint I got came from his cousin. We were out eating one day and she told me, I doubt that... Last time we were at his house, I accidentally caught a glimpse of the conversation he was having with him and he said, 'Baby, don't call me. My cousin and IAmA_TerriblePerson came over.' They had had a fight regarding the guy before so I wasn't sure if I trusted what his cousin was saying, so I just said, ""Well, they're friends and NewGuy has a girlfriend."" We left it at that. 

However, ""She said she thought I was gay. Do you really think I would keep something like that from both of you? You would be the first to know.""

Fast forward to mid-february. A had to fly back home as he was unable to take classes due to monetary issues. I'm baking at home and get a call from a close friend of ours, ""He's a friend of ours from our hometown, why?"" There's a pause and she asks, ""IAmA_TerriblePerson... Is A gay?"" When I ask why she came up with that she tells me another friend of ours, and A's other best friend, forwarded her some direct messages from twitter. A had left his account logged in her phone before he left and she thought the messages were for her until he saw what account she was in.

The conversation went as follows:

* NewGuy: That's funny

* A: I know. You think that might mean something?

* NewGuy: I don't know

* A: Maybe...

And later that night- NewGuy: I really want to kiss those lips of yours.

I froze, and again pretended I was not aware, just said, ""If it's true, I'll be hurt... Because he promised he would have told me if he were seeing another guy and so far he hasn't."" My friend dropped it.

I flew back home for Spring Break and I notice something is off. None of my friends are mentioning NewGuy, A was unusually touchy-feely with me, as well. Other days, I noticed A texting someone a lot. A few days ago we had been partying and he made out with a random, I was jealous, thinking it was with her, but then I managed to catch a glimpse of the person he was talking to and it was a guy's name.

This week, ""I like you. End of comment."" I decide to check out the account, for no apparent reason other than boredom. A few tweets down, there's a tweet saying:

* ""Thinking of you~ ""A's initials""...""

A has very unique initials

This is the first time that I saw ""evidence"" first hand

* Me: Does this mean what I think it means?

* BestFriend: Huh...

* Me: ... You know what I'm talking about.

I call him, after some more sleuthing, intentional this time, they're friends on twitter and facebook. Knowing them, though, I'm sure he already told A I found out. However, I'm still talking to A normally after that.


**END RANT PART**

**I'm a mess of emotions right now. I'm not mad that he's gay, he was already involved with NewGuy, so he lied). That, and the fact that he played with my feelings that way. He knows I like him, we go out, do everything together, get heavy with eachother, but damn

In eighth grade, you could just tell that she was a funny girl, and very intelligent. Let's just call her Emma.

For three years, that she lived with her mother and younger brother, and she loved the same music that I did.

During this time, though, one day, I built up the courage to approach her.

Long story short, went to the same college, and were together for seven years. I planned on making her my wife. She met someone else, and I just hope that she is happy.

A few months ago, and we planned on making it work because we knew we'd live together again, soon.

One Thursday, after a two hour drive, I arrived at Emma's apartment. I'd cleaned up, had flowers, and was excited to see her.

Pretty much, and it ended right there. From what I know, the two are living together already. This was a bit more than two weeks ago.

Is this legal?,TotesNotYourStalker,5,0,7,"My fiance and I went to a ""time share"" type presentation in Florida last September where we decided to buy into a vacation club. We read (more like grazed



The presenter showed us real time pricing info for resorts, including airfare. He brought up current rates on expedia and travelocity to show how they were hundreds if not thousands more than what this vacation club offers. Since we're getting married this October we thought this was an AMAZING savings for our honeymoon and life together...wrong.



We didn't get access to the website immediately to prove pricing he was stating. We finished paying the full deposit


We decided we wanted to cancel because we've been getting the run around from everyone there about the rest of our access to the information. It has been 2 months since our deposit was paid in full and 6 months since we signed up and we've not once seen what we were lead to believe was true about the club. We called them yesterday and were going to try to get all or at least some of our money back but were told we couldn't cancel AT ALL. Here is what the contract says about cancelling and money back information: (also



* ""You may cancel this agreement without any penalty or obligation within three (3) business days after the date you sign this agreement. If you cancel you must notify Sponsor in writing...""
* ""Member hereby expressly acknowledges and agrees that all payments made hereunder shall become non-refundable and shall be deemed earned by Sponsor immediately upon the expiration of the cancellation period set forth in the Membership Agreement.""
* ""In the event that Member fails to timely make any of the payments required herein, (i) to terminate the Membership Agreement and retain all sums previously paid by Member; and (ii) to accelerate all sums due hereunder and require immediate payment in full of that portion of the Purchase Price then remaining unpaid.""
* ""Each party hereto knowingly, but not limited to, any claims, cross-claims, counter-claims, or third party claims) arising out of, under, their affiliates, by statute
* ""We acknowledge and understand that (we) have the right to cancel the Membership Enrollment Agreement by notifying the Sponsor in writing within three (3) business days following the date upon which (we) execute said agreement and that if (we) do not return to the Sponsor all materials provided to (us) in connection with the plan
* ""(We) acknowledge and understand that if (we) do not cancel the Membership Enrollment Agreement within the 3 day cancellation period
* ""You are entitled to cancel you Membership within the 3 day cancellation period set forth herein and receive a full refund of any sums paid toward the purchase price of the plan....In the event you fail to timely cancel this Agreement



What this says to me is that if you don't cancel within the first 3 days after signing the contact, even if that means forfeiting all of our monies paid.



**TL;DR: Bought into a vacation club because we couldn't resist the discounts we were promised during the presentation but now that we actually have access to some of the site, but not being able to cancel at all??**

I got married to a woman that is 9 years my elder (I am 26). We dated for a year and got married since we were already technically a common law marriage and the tax breaks made sense. We were happy

I feel this is the time to say that I am bipolar, something that my wife was happy to maintain (this was already true when she met me) provided I help out with chores and kept the house up. There were arguments about chores, sure, but they were always pretty tame. But there was a jealousy about my lifestyle that always seemed to generate these passive aggressive awful comments. She would apologize, tell me she used to be a bitch but she doesn't want to be that way anymore. We would make up, and it would happen again. And again. Anytime we get into an argument now, the fact that I am not working full-time while she is comes up. Any transgressions regarding chores are listed. It's just a guilt trip every time.

Money-wise, but it comes to about 13k a year. With my lifestyle before her, I could make it work with a bit of help from my family here and there and student housing. Now, I have no money to my name except some left over from a loan that is spoken for our bills. I've tried to work, but a birth defect I suffer from prevents me from being on my feet for prolonged periods of time, something I found out after trying to work at a grocery store. I lasted a few days, coming home and silently crying from the pain in my legs. I ended up doing two months of daily physical therapy to get up and about again

I have gotten to a point where I have no release. When she is not here, barely keeping it together. No suicidal ideation, though I did have the thought that if I tried and failed I would be under her care, and that upset me a lot more than I even realized. I have a lot to live for and have no desire to hurt myself, mind. But my depression is now a constant weight around my neck, swollen from all the jeering and double talk and pointless arguments.

I can't get a divorce. My family, so I have no way to get around either. On good days, we argue a couple of times and ignore each other for the rest of the day. On bad days, all we do is fight. I am at the end of my rope, and I don't know how to even begin to fix this.

I've suggested couples therapy, but I feel like I've fallen out of love. I think she's on the same boat, but I don't know what my life will be once we get divorced. 

I don't know that anyone can help. I guess I just needed to be heard. I had to write this so I could feel like I still have a voice. If you stuck through and read this whole thing, from the bottom of my heart.

3. Just show up in the morning and hang out till the evening and drive home that night instead of going to the frat party. It's only a couple hour drive so making a day trip to this school is not unordinary

My mom told me to move in with her so I could save money to hike the Appalachian Trail (my life-long dream), and I would not be able to save up money if I had to pay rent.

I asked my mom if she wanted me to work at her shop for her while I was looking for a more permanent job so she can stay home and work on her art, I do my own laundry, I do the dishes (which I hate doing), and sometimes I cook for them.

I applied to over 200 jobs, and I'm scared to drive. I got a waitressing job the next day, in town, and took it.

I also work at a hotel

1360913962.0,18kl0u,Husband told me he loves me &amp; somebody else,something_so_simple,7,1,7,"My husband and I have been together for 10 years and Married for 8. We have no children together

When we first got together I was a perfectly healthy 27 year old female. Over the past 10 years I'v been diagnosed with Graves disease and have become a shadow of my former self. I can't walk to well these days and because of that there is a lot of housework and things I don't do.

My children don't live with us, we eventually during that time had to move across country back to where family was and we lived with my parents for 8 months, then he finally found work and for the last year we've been back in our own place. For a while I felt like our relationship had lost intimacy but I attributed it to the stress from unemployment and I thought it would get better once we got back in our own place. When we moved I tried to get more sexually active with him and bring back some of our romance. The Sex is very difficult for me because of the pain I have to deal with. I have tried talking to him about these problems but though he claimed to understand he never seemed to put in any effort into revitalizing our relationship.

About 4 months ago he re-united with a childhood friend, and it should last longer. I'm a tech geek girl, I live for gadgets, devices and computers. I've even built my own. So anyway I tell him to let me see it, so I can tweak it and possibly make the battery last longer. That's when I saw them, two text messages where they both told each other that they loved each other. Now I trust/trusted my husband and up until now he had always been very open and honest with me. So I calmly asked him why he was telling ***** he loved her, expecting a rational explanation. Well at first he said Well I do care about her. Then he started talking about how he felt she would be good for me and I was like ""Wait, both alone and threesomes. But never in a million years did I ever consider doing the poly thing. Especially right now while my self esteem is VERY VERY low because of my illness.

He told me that If he never talks to this woman again it would hurt him and that would hurt us because he would be stressed and unhappy and he wouldn't be able to forgive me. I'm dumbstruck. I love this man and I want him to happy. Don't get me wrong I'm not completely ruling out poly at all for my entire life, this person is in Georgia, we're in Ohio, so physically I know for a fact they have never done anything together, because he's never had the time nor opportunity to act on it. But emotionally I feel so hurt and drained. It's killing me and really I'm just so, so confused. I don't think I've ever felt so alone as I do right now.

So he says he loves me and he wants to make our marriage work. I told him he couldn't talk to her anymore. I told him that if he ever loved me He would be willing to not talk to her for at least while and give our marriage a chance to be repaired before I could ever even consider something like this

He didn't know it

(forgive me I'll try to be as accurate as possible as I'm writing all this from memory)

For ease of writing I'm going to refer to them in the following manner 
H= Husband
M = her
A = Me

* H: ""A found Our text messages and she was very upset. A says she was more upset about the deceit. 
* M: ""A was right to be upset
* H: ""So let me ask you a question"" 
* M: ""ok"" 
* H: ""So it's all three of us or nothing?""
* no response for a bit....
* H: ""so if things didn't work out with Me and her would you still want to be with me"". 
* M: ""I'm not going to be the cause of your marriage breaking up"" 
* H: ""well we've been having problems for a while now so if it didn't work out it wouldn't be because of you""
* M: ""Oh well I didn't know that you didn't tell me that. So you wanted to have your cake and eat it too?
* H: ""No I'm just saying that if things don't work because well they weren't meant to be would you still want to be with me?""
* M: Well if it just didn't work out then maybe we could work on something slowly"". 
* H: ""How much do you love me?""
* M: ""I love you very much
* H: ""Well A says she wants me to back off for a while and spend some time working on our marriage""
* M: ""That's probably a very good idea
* H: ""ok then so it will probably be a while before you hear from me. goodbye my love""

A few more things were said but at this point I was so fuming over watching my husband tell another woman he loved her that I just got up and walked away from the computer. I mean to me all this whole conversation says is that he's only backing off because he thinks that somewhere down the road there might be a chance to bring her into our lives. I've told him I made no promises

I'm on such an emotional roller-coaster right now

I was arrested in august of 2011 for drug trafficking and battled the case until Jan of 2013, maintained a steady job, started my own business and was able to do whatever I wanted, without any restriction.

I was never addicted to drugs so thankfully I am not facing that battle but just before my final hearing on Jan 14th I moved back home to Tampa to live with my parents while on house arrest. I thought I had a good solid set of friends but turns out that wasn't true.

Not to sound brash, I'm over thirty with no specific skills, other than customer service. I have decent knowledge of computers, but not enough to find employment in that field. My associates in liberal arts and schooling in political science certainly doesn't make me suited for any particular vocation. Craigslist, Monster, CareerBuilder, etc. has been no help in finding a career.

I believe that I have the tools to excel in life, I could use your advice and encouragement to figure out the best path to take. Please share your story or your words of wisdom with me. Should I find the money to finish school? How can I find a better job? How can I figure out what is the right career? Does it matter at this point if it is something I love to do? I don't make much money, but I fear starting from the bottom somewhere else might leave me broke. At thirty years plus, I feel like life has passed me by and my opportunity to shine was missed.",,False,,False,t3_17kzcx

My mom made the decision we're moving. That's not my problem. She decided we were going to move in with an older gay male who she has known for roughly three months. She's not only breaking our lease
She thought I'd be okay with this because he's gay.as if in my head being gay was the same as not having the ability to be a bad person. 
The similarities between these decisions: 

1. She didn't talk to me about either decision

2. She didn't tell me until it was already too late.

3. She knows both of these people personally

I told her I'm extremely uncomfortable with this, she calls me and guilts me. She told me she'd ask for the money back and she didn't want to be torn apart from me, and she loved me. 
I know. She sounds like a monster right now
She then gave the decision to me

Option one: Move in with the guy I'm extremely uncomfortable with.

Option two: Let her move in with him and go my own way.

Option 3. Have her stay at the house we're at. 

Problem with option two is I would most likely get fucked over, I'd be forced into option 1. 

Problem with option three: We're not compatible at all. I mean more than the average teenage boy with his mother. I've lived in a shelter before because we weren't able to handle each other. Cops have been called. I have a strong feeling we'd just end up doing it all over again. 

I don't like option one because not only do I barely know him
I think option three is the best immediate. I'll probably tell her to wait until the lease is up (September) and then we make this decision.

I have a child who as a 12 year old committed a crime and as a 16 year old his crime became known and he was prosecuted.  He was sentenced to probation dependent upon therapy and community service.  The therapy has various levels and projects that need to be completed for each level.  He has to appear in court approximately every 3 months for a progress report.  He has been in therapy for at least 1.5 years.  His progress in therapy has stopped.  On average others have completed similar treatment by now and he is at one forth of the way done.  

I've tried reasoning with him.  I've had others try to reason with him.  He is not even attempting to work on any project.  I've taken away every excuse he has come up with by solving it to his satisfaction.  He will not specify why he has stopped working.

Knowing the 2 great motivators are pain and pleasure I've tried setting up a simple

Discussions I've tried are:

1.  Having him tell me best and worst case scenarios on what will happen if there is no progress when we return to court.

2.  The possible affects on his adult life with a felony on his record (this assumes his juvenile record is not public).

3.  Even though the therapy could not possibly fix a problem that no longer exists he must play the game to end it.  I gave the example of Army drill Sergeants in boot camp.

4.  If he is incarcerated on his next court appearance he will be 18 and could enter the adult detention system.

He is a smart kid (smarter than I am)

I'm out of ideas.  I can see no reasonable path that does not involve jail for him.  My next steps are to tell my son when judge asks me for an update on his therapy...  tell the truth.  Tell him he has given me little to work with in his defense.  A few weeks before his next court appearance have him box up his possessions (I'd like to move in the next year) and the week before his court appearance bring home all his school possessions as well as having him settle all debts/loans with family and friends under the assumption he going to prison.

Intellectually, explored every reasonable option and tried every reasonable resource to help my son.

In my experience

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Update:  

I talked with my son and his therapist a day ago.  I told them both that there is one month left before the next court appointment.  I told them both I had no doubt if there is was not major progress he will be going to jail.  I told the therapist I didn't expect him to ""pass off"" the assignments

I continued to write to my father in hopes that I could appeal to his better side -- all of which were answered by articles from the Vatican and NARTH ""proving"" himself ""right, even though I don't intend on sending them, a form of therapy for me I suppose. I wrote this one today and it kind of surprised me; so I ask reddit, as a first time poster, should I sent this letter to my father and/or to all of my family? Please, share your opinion and suggestions.

Letter begins:
&gt;Dear Dad
&gt;
&gt;Merry Christmas! This time of year is full of season's tidings and goodwill towards mankind; a time of year where we set aside our differences, and are loved in return, in spite of ourselves and our differences. Truly, there is no &gt;other time of year where such focus and energy is spent to drive this point into the forefront of our consciousness. Yet it seems so easily forgotten &gt;at times, doesn't it?
&gt;
&gt;All of this awe-inspiring and downright beautiful display of humanity at it's finest; the ability to love and forgive in spite of ourselves is truly the &gt;greatest quality we mere mortals are blessed with. Our compassion comes as a close second. We are all human, yet we are all the same: we are human, and we all have family.
&gt;
&gt;That is, lesbian, bi, or even straight and an atheist, or of some faith other than your family. Perhaps you married &gt;outside your family's ethnicity or culture. These are the most often cited reasons for no longer being included in one's family -- almost in that exact &gt;order, from my experience thus far, anyhow. 
&gt;
&gt;So with this season and all the beauty and good it brings out in all of us, love, forgiveness, and togetherness in spite of who we &gt;are -- warts and all? Conversely, is it really only about the family that thinks alike and believes alike? Is it right that I am here when my brother, &gt;sister, or relative is denied their family? Perhaps, it also brings out our worst as well -- and it can be &gt;very ugly.
&gt;
&gt;The important distinction to make is that, or child, you have a choice: make this season a beautiful one, make &gt;being human, and humanity beautiful.
&gt;
&gt;I love you Dad
&gt;
&gt;Merry Christmas

Please be prepared for a wall of text and write whatever feedback you want.  Any criticism is constructive criticism and I know at times this may come off across as first world problems.

I feel like a complete and utter fucking failure in life and that I'm behind my peers for being single, hopefully getting a better non teaching job after a few months, and be with the girl of my dreams whom I had met studying abroad and was dating long distance.  

Unfortunately once that first half year was in, but the pressures of having to worry about my family back home combined with the depression that brought on gave me problems at work and with my relationship.  

After another tumultuous year my girlfriend had enough of my bullshit (To be honest I think I would be too if I were in her shoes) and dumped me right before I moved back home, which I honestly don't think I should have.  Instead I think should have just bottled everything up and continue like nothing had changed in my life and stay the course.  I'm man enough to admit that there were days where I'd just sit at home and mope/cry yet as a man I feel ashamed to admit or having done that when I shouldn't have in the first place.

Upon moving back home I was able to get an ok-ish sales job which I unfortunately got laid off from after a month of working there.  Thankfully I've had enough money saved up until that point to live off of.  What really sucked though is this is when I started to really grieve about my father passing away

I just get so pissed off at myself for not being on the same level as the people I went to school with on facebook and from talking to them.  Despite having gone to a prestigious university I feel like a fuck up for not having a good job or being in graduate school.  Despite having lived overseas and achieving (Yet not following through on) a childhood dream I had that fail on me

One of the only good things to come out of all of this is I'm at least not fat anymore - that's the one thing I've been able to control and I've stayed absolutely consistent with.  In two years I've gone from a probable 30% body fat to 12.2%, and I don't mean to brag when I say that I look fucking great especially for my age.  I don't think it needs to be said it feels great to be wanted by a lot of the opposite sex for the first time in your life.  People who haven't met me in the longest time are completely shocked.  I've also realized what I want to do with my life and what field I want to study but once again I feel like I'm behind everyone else, like I was supposed to have all of this shit all figured out and just be on an escalator in life.  I feel so self-conscious for having started programming at 27 when I should have been learning and doing this stuff when I was 16.  I feel dumber than the other people I took/take (Took the semester off to self study - I also built my first gaming PC 1.5 months ago)  programming classes with for having a double major degree in social sciences and liberal arts. 

I also get sick of people telling me how smart I am for where I went to school, There Will Be Blood, and Apocalypse Now.  All of the protagonists of these excellent films just speak to my soul I hate to say.  I'm developing these warped hyper-competitive views that I'm just feeling more and more compelled to follow through on to ""make up"" and I don't know whether that's good or bad.  I sometimes think it's poisoning all of my relationships with people that I have to be doing better than them.  Somehow someway I find a way to judge them as being ahead of me.

The first week, and was told that his log in information was invalid. He attempted to reset his password, and never received the email that was supposed to reset it. He attempted to call and get help. ""The only person who can help you is at lunch, she'll call you later"". She never did.

The next day, say they will resolve it as quickly as possible. The woman who he'd been trying to get ahold of for a week finally called him back, saying ""Why didn't you call or email me?"". ...he did.

She decides that

It wasn't.

So he calls back. ""Oh

He mentions that he's running out of money to get to work, call this number"". He calls.

""The cut off time for money grams is 4 pm"". (It's 4:02 pm) ""But... I guess we can make an exception. We'll only be able to get you half of the sum we owe you for your first week

I am currently at a private university with a hefty price tag. My parents are unable to help me pay for school, recent family issues have created a financial situation for my parents where they will no longer be able to co-sign loans for me. I have to find another way to pay for my education. I am more than willing to take on a full time job (or two if necessary) to pay my way through school. I'm earning A's in my classes at this point so scholarship money could be another way to make the numbers work. However, I will most definitely need to find a less expensive school.

Fast forward to this afternoon. A professor (who is aware of my financial situation and intention to transfer) expressed to me that she would sincerely like for me to stay at the current university. She offered me a paid position working as her assistant on a project of hers and hinted that should I speak with the financial aid office there may be some assistance for me. She also commented on my academic abilities and potential in the future. This is an incredible opportunity. It would be fantastic on a transcript and this is a highly sought after position. Under normal circumstances I would have crumpled to my knees and expressed my undying love

Which presents me with a question. Is it appropriate for me to take the position as the professor's assistant knowing full well that A) I will not be back next year and B) there is a chance that my current financial situation is a contributing factor in the position being offered in the first place?

 When we first got together, and had been for a couple of years. Made her quit high school and everything. She has had a fast food job, which she apparently did rather well at, but had quit it when her mom got pregnant and ""asked"" her to stay and babysit afterwards. 

She moved in with me a year into our relationship, and she started off on midnight shift. Our relationship started going to hell at that point, mainly because I worked an afternoon shift, and immediately upon getting home, she'd be leaving. Immediately upon getting up, she'd be going to sleep. When I did get to see her she was *constantly* angry.
 Now, she's extremely compassionate, brilliant, and the nicest person, and the most self-aware crazy I've ever met. 
When we both realized that this pattern was going to ruin our relationship, and they'd call her in almost every other day, and never pay her overtime. 
Months later we had an accident, just an attack on her already absolutely mentally frail pregnant mind. (Luckily, a week later, the boss was caught embezzling, and was fired.) 

So she was jobless. Looked for jobs throughout her pregnancy. Upon having the baby, my 9$  an hour is having to make it through our month.  But then one our neighbors asked her to some cleaning as he was an extremely disgusting hoarder veteran with one leg, and constantly sickly. So she went down there every morning, and since he was angry at the world for his being extremely lonely, he'd sit down there and berate her the entire time. So she'd come home an explode. Would yell, scream, and just blow up at every other sentence that would come out of my mouth. She noticed it as well, so I advised her to quit

Now she's cleaning another neighbors house. Our child is 7 months old now, and it's already pretty clean, but she is *still* upset. She starts getting angry and starts having basic panic attacks after anything goes wrong. She wants to help out, she gets frustrated without a job, and starts going on about feeling like a burden, but I almost like her more when she doesn't have one at all. I'd rather be broke than her be like that. She really does get pretty crazy.

It's never really been a big thing with me that she needs a job, they tell me they'll babysit for free, and they know places where she could get hired on. They also have no idea what she's like. Otherwise, my dad is good with it, agrees with the ""babysitter is a dumb idea"", but he's also incredibly traditional and would rather her be a housewife anyways.
 I just don't know what to do. She *wants* to work, but when she is, she's absolutely terrible to be around.

But here is where it gets interesting and I'm hoping I even have a case.
The 5pm advisory still has the storm as a hurricane http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2012/al18/al182012.discus.030.shtml?

Somewhere between the 5pm advisory and the 11pm advisory the stormed ceased being a hurricane and made a transition to a ""post-tropical cyclone"" They even share that it happened before landfall approximately 8pm.


The NHC advisory at 11pm last evening specifically states. ""THE INTENSITY OF THE POST-TROPICAL CYCLONE WAS ESTIMATED TO BE NEAR 80 KT AT LANDFALL WITH A MINIMUM PRESSURE OF 946 MB."" That link can be found at http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2012/al18/al182012.discus.031.shtml?


The Weather Channel and Weather.com shares that Sandy made landfall approximately 8pm near Atlantic City. http://www.weather.com/news/weather-hurricanes/sandy-top-five-20121028


Now. I only know the approximate time that the big part of the tree fell. About 7:30pm. I know this from text messages sent out and my mom's posting on Facebook saying that it just happened so there is documentation stating it happened around that time. Technically the event happened before it made landfall

My argument is that it was not actually a hurricane when it hit. The policy specifically states that the hurricane force winds ""from a hurricane.""

I have a very full course this year and obviously I have missed a lot of coursework up till this point and I am very unsure if I could even remotely pull it all back before end of term exams.

So

Obviously this would be a good choice to ensure that I will have no chance of failing the year as after I sort out all the lawyer stuff and finish arranging the funeral I can continue studying for effectively two years and guarantee a leg up next year. I also have quite a lot of money saved up that was to go towards having a month away at some point in my university career before I actually have to leave and start real work. So travel is also a valid option.

There are obviously a few concerns.

I live in a flat with two other people and I would have to continue paying rent, so maybe I could work for most of the year and save up some money for the years that follow?

I am also taking a very challenging course which has already tested me quite a lot in the past year and a bit

Male friend of mine, falsely, by an ex-girlfriend of mine, who we will call ""Susan,"" of date raping her about 2 years ago. Susan is spreading the rumor across his the campus of his small college. 
The night in question, dorm (common room with several 2 person rooms attached) and decided to go to bed after becoming drunk so he went to his room, closed the door, and proceeded to try to fall asleep. He heard a knock at the door, answered it, and it was Susan who wanted to come in. Susan had been drinking lightly earlier in the party, but John, had probably drank at least a 1/3 of a fifth of something containing 40% ABV. Long story short
During the time between 2010 and now she dated one of John's close friends and constantly hung out at that dorm, and hung out with John. In addition, she was bragging about having slept with John to John's friends, anyone who would listen, and even told me about it, which I did not mind because our relationship had never been very serious and was brief.
For some unknown reason, John date raped her. However, Susan is only telling underclassmen, the ex boyfriend of the girl John has recently started seeing, and people who were not a part of their mutual, close group of friends during the past two years. She knows that that group of friends would never believe her. John tried to confront her about the rumor, but Susan would not talk and told him
This is a SERIOUS accusation
What should John do? He can't go to the police because an investigation would be launched and he would get screwed, even though this meets the requirement for slander as set in our state of residence, because an investigation would be opened.

We've always had a fairly awkward relationship since he treated me like shit while I was growing up (extremely high

Fast forward a few months. I come home and something happens

Fast forward to around two weeks ago. We (family and I) go out to this resort. I didn't bring my laptop and I wanted to see how some people were doing in the Olympics so I borrowed my dad's laptop. I accidentally clicked on the upper tab where his e-mail was bookmarked, but no. I continue to look through his email (because at this point, there was no turning back) and I find A LOT of stuff. Eventually, I had figured out he has contacted prostitutes, seen some other random people from these dating websites, and he is even having an affair with one of his business partners.

I know maybe it's not exactly my place to judge/butt into my parents marriage, she happens to be a part of every single one of them. This worries me because there seems to be a lot of money involved. My mom has casually mentioned this woman before, but she thinks the woman/partner is just a random sales person he has had minimal contact with. So, the extent of his business activity with this woman is another thing he's lying to her about, which makes me question why that is. I think he's hiding his heavy involvement (romantic and business) with this woman from my mom because my mom wouldn't approve of the woman's business practices.

Anyway, but my mom is a housewife, and therefore has no income. I'd like to protect her, but I don't really know what to do. What do you think, Reddit?

I'm 14. About to move from 8th to 9th grade(Highschool).

I've been homeschooled my entire life since pre-school. My mom decided to do it because the drive time from home to the school just didn't appeal to her

Recently I told her I wanted to stop homeschooling, and I want to have some friends for the first time in way too long. I'm a *bit* shy and awkward, but I enjoy having a social life.

Now I have 2 options: 

1. Public highschool.
2. A private Christian school.

I think either of these is going to be a bit of a shock to the system

Some more about me: I'm a (somewhat) recent Atheist. Nobody knows. I don't think the Christian school would be entirely bad

What I would like to know is which school you think would be the best option. The biggest pro of a public school to me is that there are more options for people to get to know(say hi to one,000). That's also the biggest con of a private school to me. Everybody knows everybody. It would be difficult to fit in.(Am I wrong about this?)

My parents have been divorced for around four years. My sister and I have been in the primary custody of my mom the whole time

Problem is, but denies any drinking problems (despite losing a boyfriend of hers who we all cared about from a handful of extreme drunken incidents, which I won't explain but will say involved security and huge public embarrassment). We find empty hard liquor bottles in the recycling and know she hides alcohol in her room.

Her and my sister are also starting to get into more and more verbally aggressive arguments. My mom's personality is an ugly mix of self-righteous religion and ignorant profanity/hatred. These fights are often based on my mom's newest boyfriend, despite adamant denial). Any other time it's either an overreaction to a small eyeroll, etc. from my sister (who's 16 for chrissake, and what 16-year-old girl doesn't act like that once in a while? She's a great kid overall), or my mom's 24/7 aggressive, repetitive command-giving. We literally never just talk, all that's ever said is her commanding us to do things, not getting in until 2 a.m.)

I really think it'd be best for my sister and I to live at my dad's for a while, ""If you move in with your father, don't come back. Take all your shit with you."", etc.

* About 6 months ago, and the fact that he was gone for a half hour bath makes it seem like the thief lives nearby. About a month later, somebody *really* shook at our back door around midnight. My brother and I woke up - he grabbed a baseball bat and I grabbed a flashlight. We both tried to catch whoever / whatever it was, but it was too dark to see anything. We opened the door and *thought* we heard rustling grass and the opening of a fence. I mention this because there's a metal fence (with a gate) separating our home with our bad neighbors. I had a chat with the grandpa and we both wanted to call the police, but without any proof, decided we couldn't do anything.

* My parents own a fairly large grocery store ~ about the size of a Walgreens. As a result, a lot of the merchandise in our garage was gone (about half) BUT there were about 3 boxes of product placed on the right side of our garage - our bad neighbors are to the right. Also interesting, when he came home, the mother looked at him and went inside. This is strange because I'm almost certain the mother is unemployed and she honestly sits on her porch all day. So for her to go inside right when my brother came back, after they looked at him as if he was the reason, was a big red flag. We called the police and went and confronted them, asking if they knew anything about where our products went, ""I KNEW something was wrong when she kept bringing all that stuff. I kept wondering where she was getting it from"" About ~$300 worth of stuff was taken including things like snacks, 5 hour energies - what kind of 8 year old girl would steal duct tape? The officer got really sympathetic when the mom said it was her and said he wasn't going to file a report

* Today, Sum Ting Wong, Ho Li Fuk, Bang Ding Ow"" - from that San Francisco news report. My Dad got upset and asked him what his problem was, but the son just laughed and said, ""Fuck you, go back to your country"" and went inside. My mom's dad just recently passed away and she's been really down lately

My neighbors just seem really shady and today they verbally harassed my parents. It just seems like it's getting worse everyday and and I'm also worried because my parents are getting older now. Is there anything we can do in this situation?

She will sacrifice her own needs to help me even when I don't need or want help. Example
When she does need somthing there usually is no choice.

I often wished she  had friends of her own and a life of her own. Instead I AM her life. It feels like I've got a chain around my neck and its tied to her. I haven't been able to fully live because of this.

I was pretty happy as a kid looking back but when I became a teenager and started needing more Independence she would not or could not give it to me. I feel dead. It's utterly killed my spontaniety.

We had plans for Thursday, right infront of me, with another woman.  I have no idea who the woman was, could be a relative for all I know, but either way he didn't acknowledge me, so I just went on my way.

I live in a townhouse with my girlfriend and three of her friends, and C, with A being the oldest and C the youngest. Now, there are 5 of us girls in a 2-bedroom townhouse, so things are cramped. But, sister A is rarely there as she stays with their mom at her farm a lot. Sister B sleeps in the living room (of her own choice) and Sister C has her own room because her SO is over a lot and we constantly hear them having sex(which is a problem in itself). My girlfriend and I have a room to ourselves.

I believe that Sister C is a kleptomaniac. It started with her wearing my girlfriend's clothing without asking. My girlfriend politely told her that she needed to ask before wearing her clothes. She didn't listen. She started taking her clothes, shoes, etc. and hiding them in her room. My girlfriend would ask for them back, and C would deny having any of those things. She got a locking doorknob for her bedroom door to keep us from going in and reclaiming my girlfriend's things. She told Sister A that we were stealing her stuff, and of course A believed her and helped her buy and install the lock. My girlfriend bought a padlocked box to put her clothing in, but my clothing(including bras and underwear-wtf) still show up missing and I find them in her laundry. When confronted about the locking doorknob, C replied with 'That was to keep my sisters out

We finally broke down and bought a locking doorknob of our own. Within the first day of using it, along with some of my girlfriend's.

Sister B is very laid-back, her Pomeranian is not even slightly house-trained, and she is very lazy. I have to wear shoes to walk across the kitchen floor because she refuses to mop up her dog's pee or pick up its poop. She makes bowls of ramen, eats half, and leaves the bowls sitting out to attract bugs. She borrows our books and leaves them sitting where her dog can chew them, or on the sink where water can damage them.

Sister A collects money from everyone for rent and utilities. She is very specific about who pays how much, yet she never has any money. Yet somehow she managed to afford a purebred Husky puppy and a donkey. She also never listens when my girlfriend or I have something to say. She always believes her sisters and has no respect for us. She buys groceries and gets mad when we try to eat any of it. She cooks and doesn't let us have any.

1374459708.0,1isbk9,Advice for a guy: parties and making moves on girls,genheals,5,0,3,"Hello ladies and gentlemen

Disclaimer: I am not sure if this is the right subreddit for this question

I have some questions that I would appreciate some insight on. I went to a party last night and played beer pong with a couple of cool girls. As the night went on, music, etc...My female friend who brought me to the party told me to make a move sometime in the middle of the night so I put my arm around one of the girls. She was fine with it but I did not know how to progress from there. The party kind of fizzled out after that but I left feeling like I had wasted an opportunity. 

In order to make this post more complete I probably should give y'all some more information (no bragging intended). In terms of me, athletic/built, friendly and courteous. When I get drunk I get a little cocky but it is more playful than harmful. My friends who are girls describe me as ""sexy, handsome, cute, serious"". They do not think I am gay. Although the one I get the most is cute, which I believe is due to my shyness. Most girls (who I am not friends with) say it ""he is cute"" right after I meet them

So given that background, however, that being kind of cocky and teasing attracts girls (at least in the vapid sense) more than being nice and friendly. Also, when I drink, pretty much all of my social inhibitions vanish and I can talk freely/confidently with anyone. 

So the bottom line is that I have a chance to have a good night but I do not know when to make the right moves

I have the confidence to approach a girl and chat with her,etc...) and what not would be cool as well. Thank you for any insight. ",,False,,t5_2qjdm,False,,

- Alcohol and substance abuse problems
- Pending DUI

2. Find a job
3. Pay lawyer
4. Move
5. File bankruptcy
6. Go back to school

- If I do get a job, which needs to be paid in full by September. I don't know if I'll be able to get that by then and will probably have to borrow from family until I start making some money again. I already owe my mother $1800 dollars (the deposit for the lawyer). I have never lived on my own before either and I'm terrified, especially in a new city, but I must, must, must leave where I am at right now. 


- I want to file for bankruptcy because I don't think it would be possible for me to make payments on my lines of credit and everything while doing all of that. My payments all together for my cards are ~$900 dollars a month and I've long stopped paying them. I'm also fairly young and won't need to buy a house or anything using credit in the next 7-10 years. If I want a car

- I'm so close to losing it, getting fired for coming in drunk, DUI, partying after a bad break-up and running up my credit cards like a maniac on alcohol and clothes, etc.) That's why it's first on my list.

1373517506.0,1i26wk,Advice about a girl,HelloImPoptart,5,1,3,"Okay
First and foremost, and I had met her at a party the summer before my freshmen year. She was absolutly gorgeous and we really hit it off by playing catch with my best friend and her friend. (I know, I was a lady slayer back then) I was a little apprehensive about texting her, even though she was really adamant about wanting my number and wanting to text me. I had a girlfriend at the time and I was scared to death that she was going to come between us. Well, at some point my friend talked me into texting her and it was one of the best decisions I've made. We really hit it off. We had such great chemistry and she was just amazing. She quickly became one of my favorite people and I'd go as far to say at some point she was my best friend. (even though I never saw her in person after that day.) 
The whole summer I texted her just about every day and I couldn't wait to do so. I would make up the dumbest excuses for texting her and I didn't care and it didnt seem to bother her either. Well, and her dealing with her own problems it was just to much. Well that was untill about December, when me and my girlfriend of the time broke up. That absolutly devastated me, and I really felt alone at that point. It took a real bit on my self confidence too. Well that night I decided to text Bri and tell her about what happend. She was really caring toward me and made sure I was okay. (It was my first break up and I was a wreak.) after that night our texts started to pick up and they were becoming more and more flirty as time went on. And I was by no means complaining, in fact I was loving it. Well, that was untill I met another girl, her name was taylor. Taylor, and also be the love of my life for about a year. Unfortunately
Myself and Taylor had quite the problems relationship, and when you have all of thoose pent up feelings you need someone to vent them to, and that person just so happend to be bri. She always listened to whatever I was bitching to her about, and I always returned the favor to her. It was a nice trade off and we were eachothers support systems. That brought us so close together, so by about the mid point of the year we were right back to texting just about every day about everything. 
Now, something is bound to happen. It just so happend to be that me and her broke up over this. Now, I know any normal human being would recognize that she was bad for me and that I probably shouldn't have even wanted her back, but I did. For sme reason I didn't realize what I could've had with Bri, and all I could see was this my ex and how much I wanted her. Well, it just so happend that one of the stipulations for me getting back with Taylor was me stopping talking with Bri. And me with my clouded judgement accepted and went happily on with Taylor. 
After about a month into the summer of my soft more year,d never have to know. Well as it turns out, she had the hugest crush in me all along. She admitted that she was absolutly in love with me and she wanted t be with me so badly. And this absolutly killed me because I was still in love with Taylor, but I still wanted to be friends with Bri. That didnt go to well, and Bri told me that I was an asshole and how bad I was, and that hurt coming from someone I had grown so close to over the past months. So, I accepted this and moved on that I probably would never get to talk t her again. 
Well, and told me that she knew she kind of over reacted herself, but the only problem was that it wasent the same as it was before. It just felt different talking to her. Tat only lasted for about a day or two, and we both kind of just stopped talking mutually.
Well, mainly about how much I want things to go bad t the way they were with her. I don't even want a relationship with Bri at this point, I just want to be an,e to talk to her and vent the was we did before. I've been through alot lately me I'm really wishing that I had her to get me through it.

Then I stopped getting paid pretty much altogether.  It started after a financial backer decided to pull the plug over a personal vendetta against the owner

Since then the pay has increased a little, and we get new faces too.  But I've had to give up a lot in the past few months for the sake of this place.  I mean seriously, having to pawn stuff to get medicine when I'm sick is a pretty deflating thing.

Well anyways, globally.  He liked my food, saw I had some talent and offered me a job.  But I explained to him the situation, skimping on many details obviously, and said I really wanted the job, but I had this sense of responsibility, loyalty, and that I should take a few days to think things over and then come see him when I had made a decision.

I don't want to abandon the cafe altogether.  Especially the family member who is secretly invested in the place.  They are there every single day working their ass off and putting their life completely on hold just for that place and giving up just as much as me.  That's what hurts the most about this.  I don't want to abandon them because the stress of it all is starting to take it's toll on them too and it's really showing.  And no

This is an extremely hard thing for me to do

Basically, although none of our friends know this. I am 22 and she is 21, although she is in university and I am in full time employment We hardly ever argue, we have lots of things in common, we each have our own hobbies too, and spend the majority of the time together, we each have our own day to do what we please and not spend the day together, and we are both soul mates for each other, and restaurants, so it pretty much it seems perfect from the outside

A few days ago, to both increase her career prospects and just to see some where new. This is the first I have heard of any plans like this, but apparently she had been talking about it to her friend for a good few months, but failed to include me in the discussions/thought process. 

She says she would like to carry on being together, so not that long in the grand scheme of things. While we don't live together yet, she is still in student housing, and I am still at home, we had originally planned, together, last year that when she had finished uni, I was skeptical in the past about moving in together, but I make a good living for someone my age, it would just be extremely ""living on the breadline"" considering I have a car to run as well. 


Let me give you some background on me that is probably crucial to the whole story. I have not had much luck with relationships in the past.

My first; was like many social awkward people, took almost 6 hours on the train. I only visited her three times for the 6 months we were together. Now things didn't exactly get off to a great start with this relationship, a few weeks into it, she told me that she ""can't do it anymore"" for no real reason and didn't want to be in a relationship, I stupidly pursued her to stay with me. I would book a hotel and travel to see her every 2 months or so, train tickets/hotels were fairly expensive for what they were...and for some reason, she never told her parents about me (we were both 19/20 and she still lived at home too), a few days before it was time for me to go and see her again, although she claims she never did. I will never find out

Second relationship was an absolute train wreck, alot. I was stupidly enough to not see it at first. I spent far too much money on her at christmas time (new blackberry and 3ds), she got me nothing, YAY. Basically towards the end of the relationship, I had just grown fed up of her walking all over me and treating me like shit, so I ended it. Then she admitted, along with her friend

Then a few months after her

Here's where the problems come in here though, the whole situation with her moving to London is scaring the living shit out of me. 

When I think about it, she would dive half way across the room, she claims its because she thinks I will frape her. Although she has gone through her phone with me, there has been nothing there. So again, this leads me to just being paranoid.

Things are just starting to pile up, that when she goes, she'll either find someone else and not want me, or like my past, cheat on me, even though I know she won't. 

Can anyone help me stop feeling the way I feel? Or at least suppress these feelings. I try and forgot most things by emerging myself in my work or playing games...but sometimes it just gets too much.

They always go places together so if the mom has to go out she takes her daughter with.  

This was annoying to me when first going out with her cause it means that I could hardly be with her and plus the mom was mosey where I couldn't even hold hands or be close to her so we never told her that we were dating so we hand to maintain a distance when near her like just being friends.  She would walk quietly down the stairs to see if we were doing something like if we are teens.

That was back then

Back then and now though I'm not allowed in her room even if the door is opened.  She also wasn't allowed in my house cause my mom was the same where they hold us back from doing what we want.  My mom passed away but I feel like my house is too embarrassing to come into since her house is always clean and my house looks looks horrible compared to it plus other problems in which aren't necessary to talk about.

They all went on vacation but the daughter had to come back early because she has a job and the don't (medical problems) so many times a day she contacts her to see if she's ok and I just want time alone with her without any interruptions but it always seems like she's texting her to keep check on her.  If she doesn't text back the mom gets worried and bitches.

I was wanting to go to Atlantic city for my vacation and spend the night over there and she would love to go by the mom gets scared and wants to tag along to spend it with us so nothing happens yet I always make sure to be safe myself.  I always carry mace around on the streets and make it quickly accessible for just in case reasons... I don't like guns because when people get scared and shoot off a gun

Most guys would have broke up with a girl if they had to deal with the same things I've had to deal with within the first few months/years of dating.

I only have a few that live close enough to actually see them on a regular basis, and for some reason, I just don't like them anymore. The longer I go without talking to someone, but it gets to the point where I don't even want to be around them. And it sucks.

There's one girl. She's my really close friend. I see her almost every day now, and the other ones I haven't seen since school let out because they live relatively far away. And I'm not saying she's not enough, but I'm just bummed that I seem to have lost all my other friends.

I know I could have the others back if I wanted to. But that's my problem; I just don't. I tried today

It probably sounds like I'm rambling about things that don't matter. I'm not even sure why I feel so... defeated lately. Bottom line is, but it wasn't a conscious decision, and my head says I'm okay with it, but I still have this feeling of something missing. But this time I know what it is, I just need to feel the desire to have it back. I just don't know how. And that's my question: how do I learn to like people again?",,False,t5_2qjdm,True

1372655747.0,1her7a,Quarterlife crisis advice on moving love and family needed,etoile_etincelent,4,1,2,"So basically I F (23) moved to New York for college (I graduated June 2012). I am in a 1 1/2 year relationship with a M (26) Long Island native that is going well so far. However
Since January I have carried around this immense painful homesickness in my heart. I have mentioned it to my bf a few times but other than that no one has any idea. I have never missed my home state more than I have for the past six months and I really do believe I will be happier if I moved there. There are career opportunities and such for me there. I miss almost everything about my home state. What is especially concerning is that my parents are getting older and I worry that I am not spending enough time with them (I live on the East Coast and the are on the West Coast so I basically never see them). I feel guilty and like I will regret not spending time with them later on. My mother was unexpectedly checked into the hospital two weeks ago. My reaction was clearcut fear

I do love my boyfriend

money: I save and hoard as much as I can while he doesn't give a second thought to spending and doesn't budget at all. He does work very hard in a well-paying industry so I think he feels like he should not have to worry about things like that. I admire his work ethic

work-life balance: Should we both keep our current career courses, although he would be making tons of money to make up for that. My parents were in a situation like that and they had an awful divorce when I was five so I'm not sure a situation like that can work as easily as he thinks it will. He has also said that he wants to hire a maid to handle childcare and so on but I can't count on him holding that same opinion for like ten more years (when we would actually be starting a family), or for our financial situation to allow that in ten more years. Also if I am going to raise a family, my partner's day-to-day presence will be very important to me as it will be to the kids and I don't think he has thought about the value of his presence with the family. I don't think he's being sexist I just think that he is not thinking through the reality of the weight of these responsibilities and how he will work with a partner through them. This worries me because I plan ahead on these things and I really don't want to repeat my parents' mistakes. Not to mention that I will be seeing less and less of him anyways as he progresses in his career because of the crazy schedules he will get. At what point is it worth to continue a long term relationship with someone if you only see them for a few hours one night a week? I feel like his job will eventually push me out of his life at some point.

Romance: Our sex life is great but I definitely feel like I am putting more effort into this relationship than he is. I live in Inwood upper Manhattan and he lives in the Financial District (one hour subway ride at least). I am always going to his place and hanging out with his buddies, but I'm not completely clear on that either.

Communication: He was raised in a family that speaks combatively to each other, when we get into little spats it shows up sometimes as well. It's not a big deal now but if we build a life together I can see this as really being a problem for me. I have seen him straight-up lie to good friends/family members of his over important things and little details to ""impress"" others-this also gives me pause.

He is extremely status-oriented and subscribes to very traditional male heterosexual norms while I tend to question traditional gender norms. I see this even when his friends are gone and we are alone together. It's not the kind of things that bothers me a lot now but should we get more serious I would have difficulties with it.

Are all of these problems irreconcilable? or is there potential to work through them?

So I love him and we share a pure love together but I have these doubts about the future and I don't want to call it quits until I know for sure that I will not regret leaving him and the East Coast behind. I love him and I don't want to cause him any pain. I really don't want to hurt him especially now he brings up marriage with me on his own and our future and seems to sincerely want these things. He has said that he is open to moving to California but I doubt that he will actually do it considering that his family

We just moved into this apartment last weekend. No one was partying here this weekend and none of my room mates have vomited in the house.

I asked one of my room mates about this

Is there anything that would particularly cause this smell other than actual vomit? My hunch is leaning towards something in the fridge going bad

UPDATE: Not sure if I was supposed to put this here or in the comments section

Discovered the source of the smell. I originally thought it was coming from the fridge, or if its something inside the wall behind the washer.

I had a female friend over last night and she smelled it too. I immediately associate the smell with vomit

So my next question is: What would make a washer smell that bad. There's no old clothes inside of it

Not usually my style to ask Reddit for help

The thing is, we allowed him to live with us for 3 months and although we charged him rent, it was far below the actual expense. She didn't bat an eyelid, cooked, cleaned up after him etc.

I don't think they understand that I love her she's great with my little girl and we live happy life

Anyway, particularly when someone who can't defend themselves is being made a mockery of I see it as bullying. All my friend has done since having her on Facebook has been to argue with her and criticise everything she does to me. The other (who lived with us) shocked me by joining in. This isn't an isolated incident, they constantly mock and berate her and have done since I've been with her.

They genuinely believe they have my best interests at heart and have likened the situation to me being blunt in my advice that (the one who lived with us) his boyfriend was controlling him and making him unhappy. I see this as a different situation. This is them calling her names because she changed a cover photo.

Anyway, they have deleted and blocked me from Steam/Origin, blocked me on Whatsapp, permanently banned me from the Teamspeak server we use. I have no method of contacting them. They haven't apologised, or even attempted to. Now when I've extended the olive branch I'm being ignored. I still feel they have no right to act this way towards me, they were in the wrong - yes I flipped out, but they are the ones who instigated the situation and they are the ones who are blocking me all over the show.

I have to be fairly vague in case people I know see this as frankly I don't know how to talk to anyone about all of this. I'm completely broke and am struggling to even find part-time (let alone full-time) work - even though my resume includes fairly extensive experience in technology and in situations that require responsibility and dedication - just so I can save up enough money to take a single course this fall and finish my degree. I've applied to dozens of places in two towns and received one call

I've also been depressed for years to the point where I'm thinking about suicide more and more and regretting ever accepting some cancer treatments that saved my life when I was younger. The only reason I probably haven't ended it already is because I'm too afraid I'm going to hurt the few people I still have as close friends and family

To top it all off, or whatever; when I did get to hang out I'd often be made fun of or chosen as the scapegoat for whatever bullshit ideas they had), but not her. She is probably the sweetest girl I've ever met and is always there when I'm feeling like shit and always seems to know the kind of stuff that'll make me laugh or cheer me up at least a little. Honestly, days where I've hung out with her for even a few minutes have been the best days I've had for a really long time and I'm afraid of becoming that needy, desperate friend in her life, especially when I know we're probably just going to stop seeing each other in a year or so when everyone moves away after school. I feel so guilty about these feelings and would just tell her but she's in a long-term relationship that seems to make her quite happy and she's got a really bright future ahead of her with him even if she did like me back. I understand that this looks like the typical sad crush/unhealthy infatuation but I don't know how else to put it. It makes me feel weak and selfish that I feel this way about someone who gives a shit about me but is already taken.

Any advice is appreciated. I'm lost to the point where I can't even focus on things or express myself clearly. Looking back on what I just wrote it seems stupid but I don't know what else to write. I'm so fucking frustrated.

EDIT: Adding more info I guess. My dad is currently supporting me while I find a job but I don't understand why because he seems to take all of his shit out on me and never wants to talk to me about anything except his new girlfriend (my mother is in late-stage dementia and I was not particularly close to her; when I was young she would embarrass me in front of girls I brought home, and seemed to flat-out stop caring about who I was or what I wanted to do once it was clear I wasn't going to be a doctor and make lots of money to send to her). He makes my sister and I feel like garbage all of the time because he keeps talking about how much fun he's having with her and how she's the ""only happiness he has in his life"", berating us for wanting to do this or that with our lives and then turning around in a two-faced manner and talking to her about us like he's so proud and happy and supportive. My sister is on the other side of the country and definitely cares but we've both had a pretty fucked up middle-class life that definitely looks better from the outside than it really is (she got it worse when we were young, was essentially a prisoner in our house until her late teens).

I was reconnected with an old high school acquaintance via Facebook.I am now 22 and he, he came to see me and we were able to go on an actual date. We talk everyday for months, unfortunately during that time we exchange nude photos. (because I am an idiot) Everything was awesome, when I came home the next time we actually have sex. Then came the red flags. When I went back to school, we'd talk like normal. Then when I would go out to the bars with my friends he'd send me heated jealous texts. I figured he was just the jealous type and brushed it off. Regardless we were both on the same level that we were keeping things casual. Then the texts got a little worse like: ""who'd you fuck last night?"" and ""You're such a lier about being a good girl?"" (hooking up with Jim so quickly and the way it happened is very much not my typical behavior, and something I had never done before. I made him very aware of this) Once again I just have my guard up figuring he is just very jealous.
Then the big one comes:
He comes to visit, don't be such a bitch, fuck off I am with my friends) I was livid, I don't stand to be spoken to that way, not only that but the logic that came with it was so bizarre. You don't tell someone you'll see them in an hour and never show up. On top of that I had to move around meetings at my work, inconveniencing others, to be able to see him (he was aware of this). I was completely embarrassed. 

He is finally done having his guy time and wants to come get me, I bring mine. He then proceeds to get extremely intoxicated. Making a fool out of himself, attempting to start fights,and calling people (including me) profanities. I am once again extremely embarrassed this is ""the guy"" I have told my friends all about. I literally ditch him and my friends and I go to the next bar over. He finds me apologizes again and I am willing to table it till the morning. He goes off with his friends and stumbles back to me later in the night at the same bar. He then proceeds to attempt to grab my breasts, shove his hands down my pants, and make out with any part of my face he can get close to. I am resisting when he finally leans in and bites me extremely hard on the apple of my cheek. I threw a right hook like you wouldn't believe and that was it. I headed home with my friends to my own place. 

The next day I wake up to a ""come outside text"" full with with flowers and on hands and knees apology, but when we aren't having fun, we bicker non-stop about the night before. Suddenly the apology wasn't so whole hearted and I was ""asking for it to be a bad time"". The weekend ends, I make it clear we will not be seeing each other ever again.

We fight a few more times by text. Each time full of insults toward me and then later apologizing claiming it is because he loves me sooooo much. I'm still very much done. I come home again and all I can think about is the nude photos. We hangout so

Text start from him: You need to let me see you . I respond with things like: why should I see you if you say such awful things. Then he responds: I love you and I just get so worried I won't see you again. I respond: I won't be treated or talk to the way you do. He responds: by calling me a names threatening me with the photos or whatever. then telling me he loves me

His texts are getting more and more irrational

He is literally bipolar, fucking every dude in town till I die. I need a vibrator because no one will love me. The next text no later than 30 seconds later is, I love you,come over, I miss you. 

I don't know what to do. I am so scared of his irrational behavior. I am worried he is going to do something to me or my house in the hometown where we both live. I am scared of him. I am scared if I continue to not respond he will go ape shit.

What do I do? Am I crazy to be so paranoid?

Our communication problems kept us from thinking about a future together, kept us from connecting, and helped me focus on ""why it just wasn't working"".

I will try to keep it concise, and I would do anything for the people in my life, but if they were to walk away from our friendship or move away or something, I am not sure it would bother me. I feel...kinda detached from everything. In general I do what I think I need to, what the people around me need me to do, but all I do when alone is try and analyze why I do the things I do, why I behave that way, but I am not, I provide sound advice when asked, critiques

This only happens once every few weeks or so, trying to figure it all out, I overanalyze every word I speak, I don't enjoy whatever I am doing at the time. I get crazy worked up over it all, I often seem to try and convince myself I am crazy, while at the same time fighting it, I argue over it in my head. 

When with people, if a serious person is needed, thats what I am. On my own, I don't really feel much or anything really. I watch a lot of tv and movies, or listen to music...now i am thinking so I have something to emote to but who knows.

When it comes to all this, but never anyone in the same time zone as me, and never that much info with any in particular. I just don't trust them with the info.

Again, I am mostly curious as to basically what anyone else thinks on it, sorry it was long winded

My boyfriend lives in a different state... A state that I'm not entirely familiar with and don't see a whole lot of allure to. But, so obviously if I think about medical school and everything else I'll need to go through, saving money is a huge factor. The LAST thing I need is to be thousands of dollars in debt going into medical school, which will put me in thousands more. Also, obviously, another perk is that I'll be closer to my boyfriend and he really has been a blessing. But I'd really regret making this decision based solely on our relationship, no matter how things turn out.

I've also been accepted to a school in Georgia, my federal grants and military tuition assistance pretty much covers the school I want to go to anyway.

My third choice is the choice I truly believe I want. But I don't know if it's the right one. You see, many times for my performances at the state and regional level. My plan senior year was to run off to New York right after graduating and give myself a year to find out if I could make it... Needless to say, I chickened out and changed my major and decided to put it all behind me. But I never stopped regretting that. I fear I'll live the rest of my life regretting it if I don't at least go to school there. My tuition would be paid for and all I'd have to worry about would be food and a place to live... But of course, that's a big thing to worry about somewhere as expensive as NYC. Besides money, it's just a scary decision. I'd be moving to a place knowing no one, and no idea what I'm getting into. I'm a small girl, and it's a dangerous city. I can't pretend that just because I 'd have tuition taken care of, probably

I suppose some background is necessary for me to completely explain this problem I have. 

Sorry for the upcoming wall of text. There's a TL;DR at the end.

My father is an awful person, the girl said she was pregnant and claimed him to be the father, later proved by a DNA test. My parents divorced shortly after, when I was 7. The baby became my half sister (we'll call her O) that T and I never knew about until the ages of 10 and 13. 

Before my parents even divorced, and Daddy would make Mommy cry, then Daddy would go drink his 'grown up soda' (alcohol). During this time, I went through a phase where I oddly favored my father. I still saw him as my big, strong daddy who would protect me and love me. Boy, was I wrong... Turns out, my father never wanted a daughter, and anything comforting or encouraging I tried to say to him was met with a snarky and hurtful remark. He cast me out and made me feel like I was not loved by him. However

Fast forward to age 10 when I met my half sister, for the first time ever. She and I were close almost instantly... But even she had my father's favor. He also gave her practically anything she wanted: even things that I said I wanted, but he gave to her instead. His reason? ""She's your little sister, she should get it. You have to work for it."" Around this time now, my father began to not hold T on such a high pedestal. Whenever T and I would go visit our father after finding out about O, he would subtly tell us that she was the favorite now. He became very verbally, emotionally, while sparing O of his wrath. He belittled my brother by saying he would never be a true man and things of that nature, whore, I assumed he was right and knew what he was talking about since he was (supposed to be) the adult. Gradually I stopped speaking and began to constantly deny myself of things I thought were meant for ""people who mattered""

I never said anything about the abuse to my mother since my warped logic figured that I would only cause her stress and make her angry by bothering her with my ""dumb and insignificant problems"". But she's a wonderful mother and caught wind that something was wrong by my lack of speaking, and my newly acquired skittish behavior (shying away from hugs or any physical contact since I didn't feel I deserved it, still thinking I was inferior to everyone). She pressed me long enough and I finally told her what my father had been saying to me and my brother. I don't know exactly what she did after that, but we weren't allowed to see him anymore and I believe she got a restraining order against him. I don't really know though, I don't care enough to ask about him.

Ever since then, and self worth back. But I don't know how and I still struggle daily with how I view myself. My best friend (we'll call her D) supports me and reassures me that I'm important and I matter, but I don't see it. My struggles include being afraid to ask for help (no matter how much I really need it), withholding my problems from my family and friends since I don't want to bother/bore/stress them by sharing my burden. I take things away from myself just so others can be happy or stress-free: an example is not going out with my friends since I feel it's a hassle and an extreme annoyance to have me around. I don't trust people easily either. I tell people that I'm fine and happy when they ask, but I'm not, yet I can't bring myself to put a damper on their day by saying anything else but ""I'm fine"". It's weird, I know. I also barely ever speak when I am with a group of people for fear that the sound of my voice will annoy them or be a reason they don't like me around

I just want to know how I can get my confidence and self-esteem/worth back. I'm sick of living in this vicious

The clinic where I work does grooming and has a single groomer on staff named Beth. Beth has treated me like shit since day one. When I came in for my interview

Despite the obvious warning, dehydration, runny eyes, lethargic. A barrage of symptoms.  Come to find out, she's been giving these sick kittens away in this condition and I told her to cut it out. We have to fix them before any more of them go to new homes. I didn't say it rudely or meanly but she became hostile.

Shortly after that, completely ignoring me and goes about trying to get rid of them. I left the room because I was angry at being blatantly ignored and went into the lab to grab my drink and fester by myself.

I said nothing. All day. I called my employer immediately (it's her day off) and told her what was going on. She told me to keep calm

This has been going on for months. I feel like I'm walking on egg shells every day when I walk through the doors of that place.

I'm Andrea. I'm 18.
My father came from an abusive household (his mother) and his best friend (his father) died when he was 16. My mom and dad met when they were in their 20's and eventually moved to Pennsylvania to have me. Both my mother and father are physically disabled, and he is very near-sighted (pretty much can't see past his palm) and has a prevalent limp when he walks.

TL;DR - My mom and dad are both disabled and my dad came from an abusive past
-- - - - - -
They moved from Philly to Wilkes-Barre, Alyssa in 2000, and brother  William, 2001. We go to private, catholic schools.  My dad was a stay-at-home dad and my mom went to work in Social Security as a typist or something. Life as a child was good, though I remember it being different because my parents couldn't do all the fun things other families could; we were poor and they were disabled, so we couldn't go to amusement parks or hiking trips, but shed return. Years go by

TL;DR - My mom and dad fought a lot when I was a kid and my mom eventually left.
-- - - - - -
Time goes on and I remember going through custody court and my dad won us (my mom was at a battered woman shelter

From the time on until I was 14, my father made enemies in our neighborhood. I remember tagging along with my dad several times to harassment cases (that I well knew he caused) just to back him up. 
TL;DR - House becomes hoarder house; Dad constantly in/out of court
Now my dad, but he had no respect for me. I'm not sure when he started treating me badly but I think it was when I started hanging out with friends and going out (probably when I was 14). His money wouldnt go towards the bills or our tuition or our house. He began stressing out about these things and would take it out on me. He'd keep me up on school nights just screaming about the same things (how the house isn't clean, even though it needed a team to get all the filth out; and how he has no money to pay the bills). Those things aren't my fault yet he'd scream at me and hit me and take it out on me as if it was. He'd push my face into cat shit and spit on me and laugh. Hes a lazy motherfucker too, all he does is smoke cigars, go on the computer and sleep. It'd be a blessing when he was sleeping though because then we wouldn't have to deal with him.  We'd never have necessary supplies for school and we went to school grimy a lot of the time because of several problems. (No gas, no water, broken washer and dryer). Throughout this time, however, we'd deny all accusations. And we'd make the house somewhat decent (filth

TL;DR - My dad begins abusing me and because of my dad's manipulation
-- - - - - -
We had visitation with my mom for several weeks, she wasn't in danger, but she screamed. My mom made sure it never happened again and my sister never was afraid of him. My dad eventually found this out and prevented us from going over there. When my mom would come pick us up, he would tell us to hide in the house/tell her to fuck off/even make US tell her to fuck off. And we would listen because he painted my mom as such an evil character. (""She left you guys, never wanted to take care of you"" ""The only reason she wants you guys is for your child support check"" ""She never does anything for you or tries to call (when she did, he would blatantly monitor the phone calls -- even though nothing bad was being sad, its invasion of privacy!)"") So we would eventually learn to detest our own mother, why didnt she go to court over this? Partly because she was depressed that her own kids hated her

TL;DR - Visitation stops for stupid reason and my dad makes us despise our own mother (which we would find out later
-- - - - - -
My dad's abuse toward me varied in many ways. I'm an honors student, he'd say I was faking it and just continue to make me scrub the sludge of cat and dog feces and unmaintained bathrooms while he would just laugh at me and call me a 'stupid cunt'. He'd bring up fights from weeks, months, years ago and bitch about them like he still has resentment. I'm sorry but after a point, you just don't want to hear it anymore. He'd hold me accountable for everything that was wrong in the house (even though 99% of it wasn't my fault). When he talked and thought I wasn't interested (which I probably wasn't), he would corner me into a wall and beat me.
He abused my brother the worst physically. He's the youngest and the only boy. My dad never really bonded with him like father-son time. Bill used to have tantrums and would get frustrated that we weren't a normal family. He got fed up with cleaning and sometimes trashed his room because ""it already is anyway"". My dad would drag him across wooden floors , kick, him in front of us. Call him a dickhead, a dumbass. Mind you, at this time, we're fucking innocent children who got good grades, and we were well-mannered. We were forced to be  living with the problems my dad caused us. We were all anxious all the time and it was just a bad
As for my sister

TL;DR - My dad was mentally
-- - - - - -
Though all this was going on, I really wasn't. My friends liked to have sleepovers and personally, I thought I was old enough to not have to call him every hour and let him talk to my friend's mother to let him know I was being honest where I was at. It wasn't fair, I had restrictions for no reason. I followed with his demands for awhile but then I started getting in trouble for completely nothing. I would call him to check in on him and he wouldnt answer. Later when Id come home he'd start screaming at me saying ""IF I DIDNT ANSWER WHY WOULDNT YOU LEAVE IMMEDIATELY, YOURE DOING DRUGS YOURE OUT ALL NIGHT ETC ETC"" cliche teenager stuff, but cliche teenager stuff I WASNT DOING.

TL;DR - We all just hope for the best/Oblivious to our dad's craziness
-- - - - - -
Cue to sophomore summer, never met his parents even though they all wanted to. He just says no and says ""I know what kind of people they are"". I know he thinks theyre ""THE COOL PARENTS DO DRUGS DGAF BLAH BLAH BLAH"" but theyre really not. Theyre an average family and he has NO reason. So yes, being a teenager I snuck out. I snuck out at night to see him because during the day my dad would be bitching and I needed an outlet, someone who could deal with me and my problems. I snuck out a lot and eventually my dad caught on. That was a battle. He threw furniture at me. I wanted to go to school, he threw a heavy cabinet in front of the door so I couldnt escape. I tried screaming out the window for someone to help and he started whipping water bottles at me. Fed up, I finally fought back and whipped one NEAR him not even AT HIM. Just because when he sees us flinch, he laughs hysterically and calls us pussies. So I threw it and he's fuming, had to walk to school and had mini blackouts throughout the day. I had a migraine all day and I told my best friend at the time that I should go to a hospital. I say no (because Im still in that ""defend my dad"" mindset) and go home. My heads pounding and hes screaming at me more. I begin to get fed up. Weeks go by
He establishes this thing with me that instead of running away. That when things get heated

TL;DR - Fights
-- - - - - -
Finally, and now about how I run away and how it makes him look bad and how i'm going to be the downfall that will tear our family apart. I got really sick from a UTI. So I took my medicine and stayed in bed for like a week. The house gets even worse because Im not cleaning it. However, schools approaching so I need to get uniforms and my dad knew I had plans to get them that day. I ask him to let me go and just pick them up and then come home. ""NO YOUVE BEEN PLAYING LAZY ALL THIS WEEK, THE HOUSE IS SHIT, YOU JUST WANT TO GO GET HIGH WITH YOUR FRIENDS"" (???) I argue but theres no point. As I'm sitting there, he up and punches me in the face. I've had it. I get up and go out the door and across the street to the neighbors (because thats what he said to do right?) I begin telling the wife what happened and then my dad BUSTS right into their house. The wife tells me GO UPSTAIRS! LOCK THE DOOR! and my dads already charging up the steps and the rest of their family to restrain him. He calms down and they say okay to let him see me. The husband and wife go with him up to see me. He comes over as I'm crying and I say ""just stop hitting m--"" and he whacks me right in the head, in front of them. They immediately get everyone in the house to get him out and call the cops on him. I stay there for the night and the cop says I have to go back (???). So I run up to my room, and I think he's asleep. I have 6 backpacks packed and I try to open the door. It wont open. He locked it with a latch hook from the outside. I freak out and sob for minutes, I'm sorry."" She says that she understands and will tell me when the coast is clear for me to book it out of here. He goes to take a shower and she cues me to leave.  I walk out into my driveway and she throws me my backpacks out the window. I tell her I love  her and walk in the rain to my friends house

TL;DR - I run away for good
-- - - - - -
I'm at my friend's house and her mother takes me to my mom's house. My mom lives in an apartment building so theres the entrance, my dad pulls up in a car and charges at us. We get to the glass door that needs a key and we're stuck. So my friends mom puts herself between me and him to protect me.

[elevators] |glassdoor| me  -friends mom- my dad | &lt;-- so it sorta looks like this

He punches her in the face and then in the stomach and she pees herself. He starts screaming at me that I'm a whore, my mom gets a PFA against him, she gets custody of me, and theres two assault charges (that my friends mom won) against him.
-- - - - - -

So I live at my mom's currently. I'm happy now. I found out my mom's half of the story and it all adds up. I remember him whipping phones at her and her having black eyes. I remember her crying for me to call the cops but I was too little and scared. I remember him beating her. He threatened to kill her and shes so disabled
The only thing that makes me sad is how my dad still resents me. I've branched out to him still
-- - - - - -
---- Below is a little graphic VVV

We tried to start-up visitation again with my brother and sister cause I missed them. We would go to the house and they would deny us or wouldn't answer the door. Well, toilet clogged with shit and piss stains everywhere. Soda bottle filled with pee stacked up. All along with animals running amock and maggots falling out of the fridges. I cried. This entire time I had been against calling Child Services on them because I was still in that ""torn family"" mindset. But I couldn't let them live like that. I began looking everywhere, all the rooms were filthy. I opened the upstairs bathroom and twenty kittens scattered past me. Cat litter everywhere. I went to the kitchen again and opened the oven and that's when I fucking lost it. There was a carcass of a dead animal (presumably cat) just laying on the racks. You could see its skeleton sticking out and the fur everywhere. I ran out of the house with all my pictures and called everyone I could. That's when I lost all respect for my dad, and stopped caring about ""the family getting torn apart"" because honestly, them living anywhere would be better than shit.

TL;DR - How bad the house got after I left
-- - - - - -
Animal Abuse, Health Department, they were all there the next day. I'm not sure what happened when they got there but my mother and I were hoping that my brother and sister would be brought to us (seems logical right?), but no, my dad picked who they got to live with while the house got fixed up. He chose this new-found friend to take care of them and my mother and I couldn't find them nor speak to them. We were upset and desperate to find them but the family would ""waggle"" them in front of us and tease us with them and drive off. As if it was a game.


The house eventually gets fixed up and becomes a decent
We start up visitation with them again and the court grants us it.
We've had them over for visitation (first three weeks of the month) since December. And we've talked to them about our side of the story (how dad paints us as evil characters) and they share what happened since I've not lived there. Apparently (and I expected it), and we want them to tell the truth. And unfortunately, we've gone to psychologists, Children Services, the police, everyone. And unless the kids themselves say it, theres nothing they can do. Everyone looks at us like we're crying wolf
-- - - - - -
But my brother has been coming around
Just this monday

Just today we went to Children Services explaining the situation so it wouldnt be kidnapping. They said that he can't live us because of my mom's boyfriend. Apparently my sister lied about this huge story about how the boyfriend hung her over the balcony. My dad has the most mental control over Alyssa and she definitely made her say that. The took him away from us and hes now living with the family-friend that my dad chose. So cue not seeing my brother for awhile.



-- - - - - -
I'm not sure how well I clarified this, etc.


My dad had good intentions for us, and physically.


Theres tons more to tell, so much more, but I figured this was TL;DR enough :/ Sorry for the shitty grammar, spelling, etc. I was venting.
So, is there no way to prove that the dad is manipulating them? I just want them to live here with my mom, honestly because its not healthy for them to stay there. He locks them in the house all day, no phone, no internet, no playing with friends. Just him screaming at and hitting them both ALL because hes so paranoid since I left.

After four years of phases of depression and extreme anxiety, who didn't seem to buy it, mentioning things like 'oh, you're periods due soon', and not really listening to what I was trying to tell her. I tried to talk to my best friend, and she gave me the 'sympathy eyes' and a hug, and then started to talk to me about her own problems and how she probably needs help if I think MY problems are bad. 

I can somewhat understand, and appear like everything just rolls off me like water off a duck. Still, though, after the constant badgering to open up, I'd hoped the one time I try to they'd actually take me seriously.

Anyway, but wrote off the depression and mood swings and only mentioned the anxiety as an underlying problem (diagnosing me with an anxiety disorder), saying that I 'seemed fine'. That's cool, he's just a doctor, this isn't his area.

Well, and more stressed out than ever.

These days I just feel exhausted, I can't commit, and have intimacy issues. I use alcohol as a social crutch to seem normal, even to the point where I actually did shots before I went to see a movie with my friends (whom I had been avoiding). 

The only reason I leave the house these days is because being inside and feeling trapped gives me panic attacks.

I have frequent thoughts about self harm and suicide

Every day just giving up everything entirely seems more and more appealing. Just forgetting everything, people. I don't care about indulging myself in things, as I don't even find my hobbies pleasurable, I just don't want, and can't handle, any more stress.

1367464270.0,1dj1ck,"20[F], Feeling absolutely directionless, probably going to have to leave my university.",warm-blood-rush,5,9

So, my initial goal was to get into the nursing program. However, once I began my freshman year, I learned that my school had changed its acceptance policies for the nursing program, making it nearly impossible to get in unless you had already been accepted. I hadn't, obviously. This was actually alright by me, because the more I looked in to possible careers in the medical field, rather than a nurse. 

So, considering Applied Health is a science major...Clearly, this is not something I am meant to be doing. Don't misunderstand...the poor grades were not for lack of effort or lack of interest. I spent extra hours studying with groups, by myself, and with a tutor. No success. Plus, focusing so much concentration on my science classes meant that even my general ed classes suffered...and those were no cake walk on their own to begin with. After the second semester of my freshman year, my parents told me I had one more chance to get my grades up or they would stop paying for my schooling. Before we all jump on the ""Well plenty of people go to school without their parents' help!"" bandwagon, until you are 24, if you ask me.

Anyhow, they gave me one last chance to get my grades up, and they let me finish out the year. Well, I just took my last final and I didn't even get a C average. Nope. To say I feel like a failure/total moron is an absolute understatement. I've put so many hours into my school work and I've been stressed so much about doing well and yet I'm still failing at school. 

For the sake of context, I've looked for jobs closer to school and I still am, but between working what I am and school, there's not a whole lot of free time for job searching. As I mentioned earlier, I've recently realized that Applied Health is also probably not the major for me. Since becoming involved in my campus' Progressive political club, I've come to a tentative realization that social sciences might be a better fit for me. Right now, my idea is to major in Sociology and minor in Political Science, I'm just trying to consolidate for the fact that careers in the medical field are abundant and pay well, making my parents'/grandparents' mistakes, for only 325 + utilities/month. 

I guess the point of this mess of rambling is this: **I didn't fulfill my side of a deal I made with my parents: get good grades or we're not paying for your schooling anymore. Put forth my best effort in school, how to take the next steps.**

My options for school:
1. Convince parents to allow me to attend school part-time. Cost per unit is still expensive.
2. Attend the community college near my university.
3. Attend the community college near my home.

My options for housing:
1. Attempt to earn enough money per month to afford rent with two best friends. (Current
2. Ask parents to cover cost of rent
3. Live at home. Would imply attending school near home. Potentially means living on my mom's couch, and the feeling was mutual.

I know the first response is always, go to grad school, or figure it out yourself because I don't know you,"" and trust me, I have kept all of these in mind. People keep saying, ""Don't worry about it, you'll figure it out, blah blah blah

Background:
I am in my first semester as a sophomore at a university, and don’t think of myself as the kind of person that would thrive in the business world.

Interests:
I have never been really interested in one thing, like English, psychology, sociology, etc. I am fascinated by people and how they work and why they do the things that they do, but jobs in these fields are scarce, and I do not have enough outstanding qualities to land me jobs in these competitive fields. As far as my personal life, but work in a business setting now and work fine with people. I work really well in small groups and feel the most comfortable in one-on-one settings. I have had a best friend since kindergarten (the loud/social butterfly type) and we get along great. Besides her

 I was always average at math, I work at a small business where I started out in high school as an administrative assistant and now have moved up to nutritional counseling. I expect to have my certification within the next couple of weeks. I enjoy working with people one-on-one and helping clients solve problems, and I love that my job allows me see a significant change in people's attitudes and quality of life. 

Another problem I have is trying to decide what kind of personality type I am. The person I am in my social circle of friends, and work are all very different. I am the oldest child, so I am kind of used to being the boss and making the decisions. I get along with my younger sisters very well though. At home, I'm loud, sarcastic, enthusiastic, one. I have lots of energy and like to be on the go. At work I’m the sweet, compassionate

I have considered several jobs but none seem very realistic. If I though it would work out, aviation school is expensive, and job market is unpredictable.

Archaeology would be cool because of the traveling and all the amazing things you would get to see

Another field I have been looking at recently is International relations/diplomacy/homeland security or something along those lines. Dad is very involved in law enforcement so I was raised with an awareness of the law/guns/criminals and so on.

I am willing to move in order to have better chances of finding a job after college. I really need to leave Louisiana at least for a few years as soon as I can. I don’t want to stay in this hick town for my entire life.

I apologize about this being so long. I got carried away but it’s good to get it all down. I know I need to adjust my expectations. I can’t realistically expect to easily get a job in a growing field, love my job, have great benefits, get to travel, and so on. Finishing college is very important and taking time is not an option because TOPS pays a large amount of my tuition and doesn’t allow us to take time off. I am in a career planning class now so hopefully by finals next month I will have figured it out. If I am interesting in something, I can put all of my heart and soul into it. I would be willing to get a masters/double major/additional training/education. Any thoughts, advice, I’ll continue to take courses that I’m interested in as well as ones for my marketing degree.

This is a very long text regarding my life problems. I should warn you that this can get depressing.
If you'd like to read and give me advice on what course of action I should take
Or you can just read. :)
(I am not willing to go to a counselor
--------------------------------------------------------------------
So

I'll start by providing some background information on myself involving my character: 
I'm a 17 year old male student
I'm introvert unless around friends.
I'm skinny.
I reside in a small city in Texas.
My family is very broken
I live with my father
My mother lives in another city. She's sweet
And


With all that basic


For the most part, occasionally hanging out with friends, and having two to three conversations with my dad at home.
My life is definitely not where I want it to be at all


My life seems boring, I have problems that I deal with (this is where the advice comes in).


Firstly, because I'm horribly unmotivated.

* I'm unhappy to say the least. My family is in ruin. 
Growing up, and pretty much leaving my father with an unforgivable hatred towards her for basically ruining what our family had going. 
Despite now
I was young
When I was a child, a sweet, lovely Japanese grandmother to give me attention, a cozy, humble home, and plenty of candy. (I adored candy when I was little)
But now, mistakes, misfortune, and choices.
I now have two separated parents, and a blank walled, dreary house that's often dark because of electric bills, and no candy, and very little food in general. (I live in the same house by the way, and it doesn't feel like the home it used to)
My home and family life is a notch above nothing at all to say the least. I don't resent my mother for the choices she has made.


* Next up on this pity problem list is my insecurity. I have this slight belief that girls think I'm attractive
I'm noted in school for my skinniness, I'd much rather weigh more than most of the girls in my school. I always tell myself I'll workout to gain muscle mass, but it never happens, and even if it did, it wouldn't matter because I don't get fed well at all at home, due to my cheap father.
My metabolism is fast, or cook breakfast twice a day, neither of those times being in the morning. My diet is horrible to say the least.
I have this big
Next, and I would enjoy having them, because I'm kind of a weirdo and have a braces fetish. There's this one tooth of mine that bulges out and looks whiter than the others and makes my teeth look somewhat dirty, and I hate it. (I'm very high-maintenance, I know)
I know I shouldn't care about what my peers think about me, or wearing nice clothes.
I get compliments on my hair being nice, which doesn't add onto my self-esteem regarding wealth..
Man


* Now it's time for school... oh boy.. 
I consider myself to be a smart guy so grades aren't a huge issue
Everyone who knows my name makes me out to be this ""mysterious guy who's an asshole because he doesn't talk to anyone"" when in reality I'm just shy. I have friends that understand and try to tell people I'm not like that
Damn it! I hate that I care what people think!
I don't know much about this problem, and I'm sure I'll find a way to cope with it sometime down the line.
I guess I just have a hard time being myself around the unknown. I know people see me in the hall and judge me for wearing skinny jeans
That's just my own unique style though
I just want people to like me so I'll have a more eventful teenage experience other than just occasionally smoking weed with my partying friends.



* Then there's my girl problem. At the beginning of this school year
We were going steady for a while, it's an issue with me.(I'm getting better though)
I was a pretty horrible boyfriend to say the least
I regret not treating her better. One day in church
After that we drove back to her house as usual. I was sitting on the couch
I didn't talk to her once during that break. I purposely ignored her during class and in the halls. Once the week break was over
She talked about how she needs a more ""godly man"". Basically she said I wasn't good enough for her
I told her that she needed to ""respect that I need my space"". That was the end of it. To this day, but there hasn't been much luck. I wonder if she still thinks about me, and it's torture.
And here I am throwing a tweet here and there about her occasionally every week. I feel pathetic, but I'm fine without it. It would just destroy me if she found another guy though. I don't know, I'm really picky about this.
Now there's this other girl that I thought I was in love with last year. She's graduated now, and make a dick joke or two to crack her up.
I still would like to be more than friends with her
But, and I don't know if she'd think being around me is worth missing out on a ""fun night"". She's also talked about coming over to see me because it's been a while.
And I'm thinking that when she does, we've been extremely friend-zoned for a long year, and this would complicate things, but I'm feeling bold. 
Tell me if I should pursue this or not




* Next up is the oh so embarrassing masturbation problem. I started masturbating about 4 year ago I'd say. I'm still a virgin and this is the next best thing to sex
I'm a horny teen what can I say? Hahaha
Maybe I need to have sex with a girl already? That would be a rare chance though




* This problem is about my religion and smoking habits. I believe that Jesus Christ is my Savior. I acknowledge that he died for me. As years have passed
Basically, and guide me in the right path.
I want to say I've been shown a glimpse of what He has to offer by the tests He's been giving me. I think He wants me to start by getting off of weed and cigarettes
He has been giving me opportunities to turn down weed offers and cigarette offers. I've denied the weed
But
I know I can do without weed
I stay cooped up in the house all day, I haven't smoked much of anything for the past 3 days.
I feel as if I should quit for the better



* Then I have my hopes and dreams. I have a difficult time being myself. I love singing
I can just picture myself with shaky legs up on a stage. I have very little confidence in myself. I like to think I can sing well
I would stay up for hours watching my favorite bands play live shows on Youtube. I wish I could have that life. I watch shows like American Idol and X-factor and feel amazed at the people that give it their all in front of thousands of people.
The judgment would be too overwhelming for me. I was in varsity choir for the first time this school year
When he judged my voice for my singing ability he must of thought I had a knack for it or he wouldn't of put me in varsity.
I don't know. I want to be a singer for a band or a solo performer

I appreciate if you got this far. It boggles my mind that someone would want to read all this bullshit about me. If you'd like to give me advice on these problems I'm going through

I know some of these problems seem trivial

Thank you.

So the situation is this: I am broke. I owe like $3, before you start judging and shit, allow me to explain my situation a little bit. I work from home (mainly because of my condition, travel/work accommodations are tough) and managed to earn roughly 1.5k a month. I live with my sister who recently lost her job, my two nephews (ages around 13, won't specify) and my mother who suffers from renal failure. Obviously money isn't that great, and I am just running out of options. I work from home as a customer service representative, but to no avail. She lost her job a few months ago as well as her house

I try to work as much as possible, I lose Medi-Cal which pays for my caregiver. If that happened, I would need to earn an extra $500 to cover a co-payment just for him (this wouldn't include any other medical expenses I would have). If it was possible, I'd be working two jobs, but clearly I can't. I work as an independent contractor, and therefore I have to pay a shit-ton for taxes. I wish I could go back to school, but I clearly don't have the money for it, because I was only about 15 units away from receiving my AA to transfer to a University

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm basically stuck in either trying to panhandle or into doing something illegal. As shameful as panhandling may be, and I don't mind doing it, I'm just afraid of getting mugged or something.

So, never has and never will, and her attitude and scorn was too much for me today. I also told my manager that the girl intimidates me.

Five years ago I graduated with a useless degree.  Had absolutely no luck finding a job so I stuck around retail.  During the past 5 years I went back to school and got an MBA... Graduated a year-and-a-half ago. Again

At times in the past two years I've felt like I'm on the verge of breaking out

I need advice on breaking out of this rut.  Even after working three jobs I barely have enough money to buy a cheeseburger most days

We just bought a house  -- Wife had to do everything in her name because banks won't touch me (I have over $50 grand in school debt and make $13000 a year) and I'm afraid that if something doesn't budge soon she is going to have to start paying all the bills.  Our relationship is rocky due to this already

I am 27, but that is almost a joke at this point because all I'm doing is setting-up WordPress websites for local businesses and scratching together maybe $700 a month three or four months out of the year. When I stopped counting I had applied for over 150 jobs in my field and congruent fields... I have gotten a call-back once that didn't go anywhere.  I've had people look at my resume to see if they can figure out why I'm not getting calls, and nobody can figure it out.

1364318120.0,1b1vbd,I think I have depression (17 yo fruity Male from England),okeydokey122,6,2,1,"The following may be ineligible because I am in a hurry.
At the moment I am very frustrated with life. I am dyspraxic so I have alot of difficulties. I am not very good at being myself around people. I became very depressed over my summer holiday because I had no friends to talk to or go out with. When I started my new school I thought it'd be a great opportunity to make some friends. In order to make friends I'd act innocent and positive and outgoing. That is not really me. 

The surprising thing is that I have made some friends which is good and I have a humble social life but there are complications such as people thinking that I'm gay. I don't mind it so much but there is this girl I think I might be in love with who thinks Im gay.

 However recently I think she is changing her mind about that since I pretended to be drunk at a party so I could rub her leg and say nice things about her. I felt maybe I was coming on too strong but she is a huge cocktease with all the boys so I don't see the harm. I can tell she is a very unhappy girl. I get very jealous of all her guy friends with who she gets touchy-feely

 He'd threaten me with weapons and squeeze my body till it hurt. People kept on telling me that I should stay round the houses of my friends to avoid him but i wasn't close with anybody so I couldn't. They have been apart for a while now but she is thinking about getting back together with him.

Lately I have been doing alot of internal reflection. All day I imagine having conversations where I express things like my hetereosexuality and homelife with my classes. I tried to act like myself multiple times but I couldn't really decide what myself was. I've had alot of shit in my life and I think that's why Im attracted to this girl because I get the feeling there is more to her than meets the eye. She seems very vulnerable to boys and I think Im vulnerable to girls. A couple of times she's made out with girls which is weird because I might be a tiny bit gay. I get confused because sometimes I am attracted to boys I want to look like

Sometimes I think it might be because my parents would fight alot when I was young. Even though I don't remember it, he slammed my head shut in the door. According to the internet dyspraxia is caused by head injuries. It means that I can't take up any sports or instruments so I feel out of touch with the guys at my school.

If I admit they have some attraction to guys then I feel that I might miss on oppurtunities with girls because I hear that girls think a bisexual guy is more likely to cheat. To be fair

The worst thing of all is that I'm not sleeping at night or concentrating on my schoolwork because I have so much anxiety. I have an important essay that was due in yesterday but I don't write it because it's on a book with domestic violence and a weird little crazy boy that does peculiar things that remind me of myself. The dad in the book also has another wife in another country which I don't like because my dad left my family for another woman abroad. He took all his money with him so now Im living off the state. Its really hard because in my classes the richer kids bitch about people who live off the state. They say that people who live off the state smoke weed and don't look for a job. It's sad because I noticed that my mum does those things. One time she smoked so much weed that she turned super crazy and started having batshit hallucinations. The day that happened I was sick in school (it was just a coincedence). Her boyfriend had to pick me up because nobody could find my mum.

If my schoolwork keeps on going badly then i might have to repeat the year but i find it so hard. my english teacher keeps on getting pissed off with me and sometimes she annoys me she tells my class that the dad in the book we are studying is a good father when I don't think he is. I am very upset because I wanted to go to a top university and I had a dream to go to a top university but I think ive been doing so badly lately that it wont be possible. 

I just feel so weird because I live in a rural area with nice normal people who dont really understand me. I talk to people in real life about my problems because Im worried they wont believe me. Ive tried doing so before but people refuse to believe. One time my sister's girlfriend told the school that I went to that I was getting abused but the school didn't want to do anything to avoid scandal.

I really like this summer job I have at an arcade/mini golf/driving range.  I've been working there for a few years, I have a flexible schedule, and the commute's good.  The problem I have is with the higher ups.  I didn't have to deal with them early on, but ever since I got promoted I've had to deal with so much politics and incompetence it's been ridiculous. Think hell's kitchen owners with golf balls. 95% of my job is awesome, but dealing with those above me is unbearable.

I've bailed them out of their mistakes on multiple occasions, and I can keep the old, shoddy equipment running better than anyone else, so I'm indispensable and they don't want to fire me.

However, I don't like people fucking with my family.

I have a very good friend, and he somehow reasons that were OK with that. We say, Anon we don't want to fucking watch you play NHL-10 we want to watch the venture brothers. He thinks that means ""after this round that you just started that will probably last 30 minutes will you allow us to watch TV?"". We try not to let him play music anymore, because instead of playing something from the LONG list of music we all collectively love, he'll play something that he wants to play, that we've all heard a million times. Which is usually either one of a few dubstep songs, or math rock but that's besides the point.

He does other things like assuming because he wants something to happen

He seems to have this god complex, which might obviously cause some frontal lobe damage that would impair things like judgement and empathy.  He also used to have a drinking problem, once again in his adolescence.

During the beginning of college, she tries to kill herself 3 times. During the biggest attempt, I am forced to call the ambulance on her because she overdosed on her pills for dysthymia. I sit through with her while she is on suicide watch, and make sure no harm comes to her. I then go through rape therapy with her and try to help her get back on her feet. We agree to not have sex for until she feels she is ready (about 4-5 months til the breakup). We stay together, and are somewhat happy during that time. She tells me she is still recovering. At the start of this summer (now my sophomore year of college) she dumps me. She says that after all of the things she has been through, she needs space. Jessica claims to have lost all sense of her own identity, and can only find herself as ""us"", and we parted ways. 

Tonight, and he felt terrible and apologized to me. They had sex. When Jessica and I were talking, she told me that they had only made out and nothing more serious than that had happened. She lied to my face. I then ask her if she had seen anyone since we had broken up. Apparently shortly (1-2 weeks) after she dumped me because she didn't need to be in a relationship, she was fucking another guy.
