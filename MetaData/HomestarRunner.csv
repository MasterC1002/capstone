It also says so on the HR wiki: http://www.hrwiki.org/wiki/Hiatuses

The statements below are my personal opinion of what's happening

""Who cares?"" You might ask. Matt's Twitter page being gone doesn't say anything about Homestarrunner

Well, the Decemberween toon. The last overall update was to the twitter page being the ""when you least expect it"" update. 

I have three theories to why Matt deleted his Twitter this January. Here they are in order from the least plausible to most plausible (in my opinion): 

1. Matt didn't like/need Twitter

2. Matt temporarily ""deactivated"" his Twitter because he was constantly being annoyed by fans after the ""when you least expect it"" update getting messages like ""HUR DUR WENZ DA NEW STRONG BAD MAKE NAO PLZ."" This theory implies he will reactivate his Twitter once the updates from the update blow over.

3. He deleted it not because of the fans

Let me explain. 

The Twitter said that he currently was dealing with family issues and a new child. It also said he was working for the Nickelodeon show ""Yo Gabba Gabba."" It also promised an update to content on his website. Here's what I think this all says.

Matt is settling in with his family and now has a steady job. This job was promising, people still buy his goods, but it's no secret that Homestarrunner's viewership has gone significantly even before the current Hiatus. There have been previous hiatuses, but this is by far the longest of them all. 

Actually, but the end of the road. 

Matt deleted the Twitter because it contained a promise for content that the fans were bugging him for. This content will never come because of his current steady job that he needs to support his family. Matt might really care about his fans and want to continue with the shorts, his job, and time he and Mike need to make the toons. Whenever people say there's never going to be another Homestarrunner toon, opposers would point to this picture as a symbol of hope for the website. Matt deleting it shows there is no hope for the future for the website, and just is as they left it.

Anyone who disagrees with me can go ahead

So let's stop wasting time hoping for a new toon, and laughs we had being with Homestar and the rest of the wacky gang.",,False,self,t5_2rj30,False,,

Solve for x:
