1365819453.0,1c8xd6,Lessons learned: why anarchists fail or succeed,hakomasong,538,79,189,"I've been an anarchist for a decade, the NoJuvi working group

As a participant in these groups

**Anarchist groups should focus on doing one thing of value to the community and do it well.**

E.g. Indymedia, creating counter-narratives to local corporate media). But the implementation was not. The group tried to do too many things at once - maintain a constantly-updated website, contribute programming a low-power FM station, and create a physical space where community members could create their own media. The costs and logistics of doing any one of those things were significant. With a small all-volunteer collective composed of young people with work/school obligations, it was impossible to carry out all these activities and raise the money to do so. An inordinate amount of time/money was sunk into creating posters for benefit concerts and stickers - all of which was fun and self-gratifying, but not a core objective. 

IMO, and then gone out and done really solid reporting on local issues. We should have just tried to do that until we'd built up a proven track record, then potentially tried to grow into other areas.

[Seattle Solidarity Network](http://seasol.net) is a counter-example. I've only recently joined, intransigent bosses finally caved in and paid the wages owed to vulnerable employees who'd been taken advantage of. 

[Treasure City Thrift Shop](http://www.treasurecitythrift.org/) in Austin is another example - a non-hierarchical collective formed and opened a thrift store that donates the profits to grassroots groups. It's been a great success.

**Anarchist subcultures do far more harm than good. They create insular cliques which wall off

At Food Not Bombs in Austin, driving out to a park, and serving/eating together. We did one thing and did it reasonably well, but no one ever went to the trouble of trying to self-evaluate - to measure how many people we were serving, how we could reach more, or survey the people we were purportedly helping about how we could do better. In fact, when I talked to homeless folks, a church-affiliated group

Occupy Seattle quickly degenerated into a clique, there was no organized process for intake of people who wanted to join. That first night, there was a general assembly. I and a few other newbies had no clue what was going on, because no one cared enough to explain it to us. Some of the veteran Occupiers, indeed a lot of anarchists I’ve met, came off as arrogant and bitter. Certain personalities dominated. I know local anarchists with kids and jobs who felt like it was a hopeless project. I think they should have at least tried to participate - the larger public shares in the blame for Occupy’s deterioration - but I sympathized with their concerns.

**Do not be afraid to participate in local policy struggles and ally with non-anarchist groups. Embrace the values of respect, and discipline - don’t denigrate them.**

Foot Not Bombs showed no inclination towards organizing against a local ordinance that would have criminalized the homeless for panhandling. Other liberal groups took up the cause of opposing it. We could have been a major voice in that debate. But, I thought.

The fact is that all politics are local. So I was excited to join a group last year organizing against a King County ballot proposition to renovate and expand the local juvenile detention center - the NoJuvi working group. But the group was more interested in articulating, a local defense attorney from the Black community who works on these issues showed up. He tried to participate, demonstrating a reservoir of knowledge and community expertise as he did so, but was mostly ignored. Nobody took down his contact info or was willing to recognize his unique qualifications - he did not come back. At several meetings I attended, the question of an official position on prison abolition kept being discussed ad nauseum. 

No direct actions were carried out. No community organizing was accomplished. There was a wholesale dismissal of local groups like the ACLU or NAACP

Ultimately, Texas. Anarchists were participants in that struggle, but instead of obsessing over ideology, they focused on allying with immigrant groups and journalists and creating a public relations nightmare until they achieved their objectives.

When I worked at UW, my friend and his buddies tried to ignore her. My friend’s attempt to create a stronger anti-racist discourse around the incident went no further.

There are zero historical examples of successful US social movements composed solely of anarchists, to work with lawyers, workers, doctors, journalists, musicians, celebrities, and even on occasion a politician or businessperson who may agree with us. We have to bury whatever reticence there might be or contempt we might have towards these folks - ultimately, but they are a minority.

**It’s okay to hold each other accountable. Recognize differences in capacity

Egalitarianism doesn’t mean that all people are the same. Some people are better at certain things than others. Some are better writers. Some are better at being concise and logical in meetings than others. Some are better at following up on what they say they will do. There are often inequalities in experience and ability.

As anarchists, but person B knows how to do it. Thanks for your efforts Person A, but person B really should be the one to handle this from now on.” If Person A is offended or demonstrates a passion for the thing they failed at, the group or person B can work on training or accompanying them. 

In order to be effective, that should be encouraged by their peers. A culture of rewarding accomplishment - if it’s accomplishment in resistance to capitalism - isn’t capitalist. It’s common sense. 

**Drugs

I videotaped myself being [pepper-sprayed](http://www.mediahacker.org/2011/11/15/in-which-i-am-pepper-sprayed-in-the-face-by-police-at-occupyseattle/) in the face by the Seattle police at an Occupy demonstration. The video got picked up by the New York Times and various media, who were hurling a stream of invective at the cops. 

We have nothing to gain from hyperbole. Yes

But we shouldn’t be nursing this constant rage. It’s not healthy for us and it won’t lead us to have productive interactions with anyone. Have you ever seen someone respond positively to yelling or cursing? Do we do this to each other? No. I’m not going to get into the violence vs. non-violence debate here

I won’t belabor the point. The same reasoning basically applies to drugs and alcohol. They don’t make us any stronger or appealing.

**tl;dr Anarchists should try to do one thing of value to the community and do it well. They should do so in a strategic way and be open to alliances. Subcultures, and rage suck.**

This is the third communiqué from the 99 percent.

Today, rolling through the blocks around the New York Stock Exchange. At 9:30 AM, we rang our own ""morning bell"" to start a ""people's exchange,"" which we brought back to Liberty Plaza. Two more marches occurred during the day around the Wall Street district, each drawing more supporters to us.

Hundreds of us have been occupying Liberty Plaza, held a candlelight vigil to honor the fallen victims of Wall Street, and filled the plaza with song, dance, and spontaneous acts of liberation.

Food has been donated to the plaza from supporters all over the world. Online donations for pizza, Madrid, Montreal, and other cities, and have exceeded $8,660. (Link to donate: www.wepay.com/donate/99275) On Saturday we began our general assembly, two thousand strong, bedding down in sleeping bags and donated blankets. By 8:00 PM on Monday we still held the plaza

We speak as one. All of our decisions, based on human need and sustainability, not corporate greed.

Planned and spontaneous actions will continue throughout the coming days. Expect us.

My route will be from the east coast of the US to the west coast, 30 -40 in a duffle bag, and the remainder in a harness-vest on my dog. I'll be taking tools necessary for rudimentary woodworking, stonework, pottery making, shoe &amp; clothing repair (i'll eventually be making all my own), gardening, since I'll only be taking an emergency cash reserve and otherwise not using money or credit. I've also constructed a pair of roll-up solar panel capable of powering a small tablet PC and smartphone

I'll be growing, from which others can benefit in the future. This will all be done ""illegally;"" I will be trespassing and squatting, but I plan to mostly avoid other people and try to remain unnoticed so that this won't be a hindrence. I will, very occassionally (once or twice a year), walk into a town to find an internet connection, but I will otherwise attempt to eschew the rest of mankind.  

EDIT: Ok, if it happnes. A lot of you are focusing on that as the main point of commentary, and while I appreciate the interrest and concern, I have few details to offer regarding that portion of the trip yet because I planned of having a few years to properly educate myself about the feasibility of it. If it proves to risky a venture for my liking, I will set my sets elsewhere. But again, thanks for all your feedback. This has been a helpful AMA for me, and hopefully interresting for some of you.

For the mods not happy about other people's use of language etc, you're up against immaturity that can't yet comprehend *serious business*, instead you're making it intolerable for the rest of us. Every time you ban someone or create yet another wet paper bag policy you radicalise the rest of us in to *not* wanting to contribute in case we happen to use language not authorised by the chosen self aggrandising few. I don't want to contribute only to have to spend the next 14 hours being dissected and micro analysed to see if I am a comrade or not, you're not allowing me to freely associate.

It is adjusted for *profit*

Sales associates, so when they claim most of our workers make more than minimum wage, they're technically not lying.

Granted

Conversely

-----

It should also be noted that an entirely worker owned operation would most likely not utilize overseas sweatshop labor for the bulk of its products; I feel this would most likely even out by slightly (if not greatly) higher prices all across the board. This is a whole other issue.

(Shh.... Don't let capitalists find out that sweatshop labor is bad. They'll throw a hissy fit about how they're rising these people out of the darkness and helping them or some shit.)

-----

All of this, development, investment, returns, hiring/firing practices, retirement packages, all that good stuff. Just a basic idea of what worker ownership could mean. 

With prices capable of remaining relatively similar (although in this particular case, you're looking at the greatest bulk of the local workforce living in the $60-$90k range instead of the $6-$19k+welfare/food stamps range. Which then is transfered to the rest of the local (and worldwide thanks to the internet) economy. 

(Of course

It doesn't mean that there are no more rich people and no more poor people. But it does mean that the rich are not *as rich* and the poor are not *as poor*.

How far are we willing to accept that investment is the greatest thing to build an economy? That the investors deserve the bulk of the profits? That ""risk"" is a justifiable excuse to steal $57

Unfortunately their announcement is in greek. I translate it below

&gt;The workers of the Γ.Ν. (General Hospital) of Kilkis: doctors

&gt;1. We recognize that the current and enduring problems of Ε.Σ.Υ (the national health system) and related organizations cannot be solved with specific and isolated demands or demands serving our special interests

&gt;2. We recognize, in order to face its enemy - i.e. the people- weakened and fragmented, wishes to prevent the creation of a universal labour and popular front on a national and global level with common interests and demands against the social impoverishment that the authority's policies bring. 

&gt;3. For this reason

&gt;4. The only way to achieve this is to question, but also the legality of the arbitrary authoritarian and anti-popular power and hierarchy which is moving towards totalitarianism with accelerating pace.

&gt;5. The workers at the General Hospital of Kilkis answer to this totalitarianism with democracy. We occupy the public hospital and put it under our direct and absolute control. The Γ.N. of Kilkis

&gt;6. The government is not released of its economic obligations of staffing and suppling the hospital, through a common popular struggle, of the current government and any other neoliberal policy, no matter where it comes from (d) a deep and substantial democratization, that is, one that will have society, rather than a third party

&gt; 7. The labour union of the Γ.N. of Kilkis, the retention of work, serving only emergency incidents in our hospital until the complete payment for the hours worked, and the rise of our income to the levels it was before the arrival of the troika (EU-ECB-IMF). Meanwhile, knowing fully well what our social mission and moral obligations are, we will protect the health of the citizens that come to the hospital by providing free healthcare to those in need, accommodating and calling the government to finally accept its responsibilities

&gt; 8. We decide that a new general assembly will take place, which will start from that day. The general assemblies will take place daily and will be the paramount instrument for decision making regarding the employees and the operation of the hospital.


&gt;We ask for the solidarity of the people and workers from all fields
It's either them or us!

&gt;The above decisions will be made public through a news conference to which all the Mass Media (local and national) will be invited on Wednesday 15/2/2012 at 12.30. Our daily assemblies begin on 13 February. We will inform the citizens about every important event taking place in our hospital by means of news releases and conferences. Furthermore

&gt;We call

&gt;a) our fellow citizens to show solidarity to our effort

&gt;b) every unfairly treated citizen of our country in contestation and opposition,

&gt;c) our fellow workers from other hospitals to make similar decisions

&gt;d) the employees in other fields of the public and private sector and the participants in labour and progressive organizations to act likewise,,False,,t5_2qh5j,True,,True

1368307153.0,1e5ct7,Iama anarchist and I was active in the European extreme right for 5 years. Here is my opinion on antifascism.,ExNeoNazi,265,56,122,"I am in my early 20s and I up until last year was a very active member in the European far right scene. I come from Sweden and that is where most of my experience comes from but I have travelled to other places and met a lot of people from all over the far right. 

The far right movement is an environment

What attracts people to the extreme right? Mainly one thing

This is the common denominator amongst people who join the far right.  They are people who feel that they didn't get what they deserve. They feel cheated

These people come to the marketplace that I described above without ideology. They have a strong sense that they where promised things that they didn't get. The look around the marketplace and they see various prophets and they find one that they like. It can be nationalsocialists, counterjihad or some other idea. This new prophet tells them that society was good and that for some reason (jews, muslims, communists) they are not getting what they deserve. We must get rid of the problem so that we can get what is rightfully ours and return to a good society!

The extreme right scene is very interesting to watch. The marketplace that I described mainly exists on the internet. If you watch the forums you will see bitter users who just signed up and older users who support a certain faction. When something happens in the world they turn to their prophet (David Duke/Gates of Vienna/Nigel Farage) and start spreading their prophets message. Whoever makes the most noise wins. Often the message is purposely dumbed down and simplified so it can easily be picked up and spread.

How is this most effectively stopped? First of all recognize the legitimate issues that make them bitter. Unemployment

I think the best way to stop the far right is socially. Take your mask of and talk to the local nazi. Why are they bitter? What social issues concern them? Provide them with new information. The far right forums have strong hivemind. If you say the wrong thing you get punished

Ask them what society they want to live in. Don't base your struggle on what you hate but what you want. Ask them what they want  and discuss how this can be achieved. We spent so much time discussing problems and the future race war but completely forgot what was going to come after the race war. 

The worst antifascist campaign ever was in Germany when antifa had a sign that said no sex for nazis. The last thing bitter rejected men need is more rejection. That was what created Breivik. The next time there is a nazi demonstration in town I am going with a sign that says we still love you alternatively free hugs for nazis. The best way to stop them is to change their opinion

Why don't disgruntled workers join the left? Many reasons. Some are put off by culture war issues

There are two types of people in the extreme right movement. Followers and prophets. Followers are the people who I described above. The next group are the ones that are the big problem. I call them the prophets. These are the ones that provide bad solutions to the members. They are the bloggers and the ideologues behind the extreme right. These people are extremely dangerous. In economic hard times they might get a mass following

Being not-for-profit financial cooperatives, through lower rates on loans, higher rates on deposits, lower fees, and conveniences like ATM surcharge rebates. Perhaps more importantly, this unique structure helps credit unions exist as an alternative to big banks in the financial services marketplace.

Congress has begun the process of reforming the tax code, it would be very challenging for credit unions to continue offering the high level of value which members deserve and have come to expect.

As far as moderators go, voluntary, participatory (etc.) structures of organization and the rigid oppressive institutions of the State or capitalism. Moreover, you could say that just because an anarchist dismantles oppressive hierarchies whenever they arise doesn't mean they sit around while opportunists (here, trolls) take everything. Groups can and should spontaneously form and organize to defend themselves. The problem arises if that organization becomes so rigid that the oppression starts taking place internally. EDIT: yes, this may have even occurred in r/anarchism.

And yes, this subreddit). Most of us are more casual members of the community, and for us it functions more like a book club than a model for an anarchist society. EDIT: maybe this is my privilege for not holding unpopular views in this community.

This is the first communiqué from the 99 percent. We are occupying Wall Street.  

On September 17th,000 of us marched on the Financial District. At twelve noon, a detachment of us marched on the head of Wall Street and formed a spontaneous blockade, prompting the New York Police Department to threaten arrest. Speakers including the Reverend Billy Talen of the Church of Stop Shopping, and actress Rosanne Barr spoke on the steps of the American Indian Smithsonian Museum to the crowd, which included conscious rappers Lupe Fiasco and Immortal Technique.

Over 1, not to the banks.” Many stayed at One Liberty Plaza, where later in the evening a meal was served and water was distributed. Song, dance, puppetry, and other art added cheer across the plaza.

My anarchist friend told me that he's procured a neat bit of land out in the bush which the local government had forgotten about. He asked about it and they said he could do whatever he wanted with it
The place is awesome-heaps of indoor space, and run a sort of travelers' hostel there. We're also thinking of making a free store and free library stocked with political literature, and using the space to teach tourists how to grow food and do things like guerrilla gardening. Eventually I'm going to move in there as well.   
  
Basically, we'll need essentially no money considering the circumstances, there are plenty of local business we've chatted to who are keen to buy surplus vegies as well as farmers' markets in the area.   
  
I'm pretty excited and just wanted to tell someone  ^_^ I caught up with all my friends from Occupy last night and they were all really stoked, then making vegie patches etc. During the process we're going to make videos, take photos and I intend to start up a blog documenting the process and offering tips to help other people become self-sufficient.

Still, and I said they may but I won't answer anything. They asked if I was a citizen, so I said yes. Then I insisted I wasn't going to answer any more questions without a lawyer and I asked why they are here, and they said that they received a complaint about me preaching neonazi ideology. I knew that I had never done this and so that relieved me.  Then one of them said that this is a free country and I can believe whatever I want, be it the NSM or whatever, but only if I express that in a peaceful way. I then laughed and told them I'm not affiliated with the NSM. They asked what groups I am affiliated with and I told them that I am not affiliated with any groups, and am a registered independent. Then they said that it's fine to have my beliefs, as long as I act out my thoughts peacefully. Then they asked if I know of any big plans that might go boom any time soon, so I know that they had done research on me and knew that the neonazi accusation was bullshit.

I know I didn't react perfectly

But just keep in mind these two things.

* They affiliated me with the NSM, you're not safe from their eyes. I never thought this would happen to me, but it did.

* They thought they could trick me into saying something about my beliefs through accusing me of being a nazi. Even if it wasn't about that

This is not the time to decide what should replace the current government, corruption, violations of rights, and the damnable reality of the populations silent complicity in allowing these acts must end. 

John Milton said, the people of the state deserve this tyranny so long as it occurs. This is true because the people have the ability to stop these acts should they truly believe in stopping them. 

I currently reside in Boston. I am willing to attend whatever can be organized in this area

There is no appropriate time for revolution. The time is always the occurring present. 

I propose July 15 as a date for more radical

EDIT: Some have pointed out that the tone of this post is parochial. I apologize for that, but I am trying to get people to start acting. 

I think my generation tends to be content with ""being in the know"" rather than actually doing anything about a problem. I just want to change that.

EDIT 2: I accidentally wrote being in the now rather than being in the know. Oops

EDIT 3: The post has turned into discussion surrounding ideology when I wanted it to be surrounding idealogical fluidity WITH action.

I just read this and felt the need to vent a little:


People interviewed in the article, ignorant etc. But really? Is that all we can see is ignorance? What really drove them to tear it down? What really drives companies to do much of anything other than profit?

My mind can't help but thinking ""Capitalism Strikes Again."" In a system that promotes capital, the problem lies in the system from top to bottom. Whether it be the institution that contracts the company to build the road on a low bid contract and demanding it be finished quickly by any means necessary, or the contractor who see's an opportunity to save some money by harvesting rocks from a nearby pyramid. From the foreman who see's a chance at finishing quicker and possibly getting a bonus, to the workers who are under-paid and laboring in the hot sun who see the opportunity to do less work and go home early. 

The Capitalist economy does have a trickle down effect

Yes, some of these fuckers are sexist or racist.  But the worst thing we can do is downvote and completely dismiss them.  The way we come off is dogmatic, and unattractive to both the ancap and any outsider interested in anarchism, this does not help our movement.  Instead of acting the way we've been acting, we could help to educate them (of course they won't listen right away, but anything as small as an opposing opinion can help make them rethink, and eat at their existing opinions).

Then we have [proposals like this](http://www.reddit.com/r/metanarchism/comments/1ibw1o/proposal_autoban_any_anarchocapitalist/).  What, there's also that Noam Chomsky quote.

&gt; The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion

It's not only that.  I've seen ancaps downvoted simply for being ancaps

My attorney asked for time served in lieu of the court costs of $74 and the judge refused that as well. My attorney and I will be appealing this to the county court now based on principle alone. We will subpoena the city manager as well as others on the city council.

There is no shortage of polemic criticism of the Occupy movement coming out of the anti-capitalist community.  Much of the criticism is right on point

We all love to consume the riot porn that comes out of Greece.  But behind every Molotov is a huge network of support for the insurrectionists.  Building support and networks and radicalization is a process.  We can either choose to act in solidarity with this nascent movement or we can remain bitter

This is about the cop who shot the unarmed

Well, with a few Latinos thrown in. The cop claimed he thought he was pulling his Taser, which was on the other side of his pants. Well, despite the fact that he had no justification to use a Taser anyway, the jury went with involuntary manslaughter, and the judge only sentenced him to 2 years, most of which has already been served.

People gathered in Oakland (where the shooting happened) to protest the ruling. Cops had already been sent from as far away as Monterrey, but the vast majority were peaceful protesters. The cops cornered them and forced them into residential neighborhoods.

Associated Press(http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_TRAIN_STATION_SHOOTING?SITE=TXHAR&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT), and saying the people chose to ""terrorize"" residential neighborhoods!

The truth (see first link) is that the cops cornered them, refusing to let them use the restroom (one woman urinated in her pants), falsely telling women they were pregnant (They give woman who are arrested pregnancy tests as a routine policy), sexually harassing the women, etc.

The most disturbing part was when they needlessly marched them into the building in single file after making them stand at attention in two lines. The sound of their sneakers hitting the pavement in unison was pretty disturbing. 

This made me think of the Hitler youth and of Kony's child soldiers. I will never understand why a parent would send their child to be indoctrinated by the imperial cult so that their son or daughter can go die for the whims of the ruling class. The most ancient feudalism, and I can see a picture of her from where I sit in my University library. Her picture is qualitatively no different than the ludicrous pictures of the North Korean dictator. She is the 'dear leader,' the 'head of state,' and children are expected to learn to fight for her to their death. 

I cannot think of a more disturbing sight to see in a modern society than children being trained to march. There is no better way to sew the seeds of destruction than to teach a child that they are a slave to the head of state

""I, Queen of Canada, Her Heirs and Successors. So help me God.""
