Throughout the night I saw that they were both still going 100% with our guys. Then the bigger more experienced guy paired up with my coach. He started nice and easy at a good level but out of the blue went 100% bat shit crazy! Throwing jumping knees at my coaches head repeatedly, flashy stuff that could really do damage if it landed. My coach kept his cool and just defended all his shots and tied him up in the plum. We don't throw knees to the face so he just held him there to make a point but the guy still went crazy, almost as if he didn't realize the other guy was going 30%. My coach faked a spinning back elbow counter off of this guy's jab to let him know that he could get him if he wanted to, to which this guy said ""No elbows, those are illegal"", and then continued to try to do flying knees 100% to the face. 

Here is the reason I am posting this...The whole time as I watched my coach and him spar, I'll go hard with you right now, but don't come into a new gym being super nice starting out at a normal pace and then suddenly go all out without notice. it's very disrespectful to your training partner and to the gym that welcomed you.

1339535596.0,uym3a,Things I wish I knew before I started training: Tips for new muay thai practitioners,ronin1031,64,4,23,"I’ve been doing Muay Thai off and on for almost 6 years now and there are a few things I wished I had known before I started training. I’ve made a list below (sorry for the novel)
So tell me your tips

Here are my tips in no particular order:

- Semi-elastic (aka Mexican style) hand wraps are available (and in my opinion, girls, usually 120”. The length is important, if you’re unsure of what length to get, go for the longer ones, just means you can add extra support to writs, thumbs, etc.

-Thai shorts are key! They may look silly at first but they are cut so the legs are flared out to make kicks easier. It may not seem like much
**Bonus tip** if the wide waste band bothers you, I’m 7-0 right now for predictions. Prove me wrong Reddit!

-Shop around for a gym. This one is probably the most important. The first few places I trained I felt more like gym member#### than an actual person. If the owner/trainer takes the time to walk you around and introduce you to everyone (not just the fighters
On that same note, there are some exceptions like Iron Tiger, etc.)

-Clinch is very, and the most often neglected. Most gyms (again, my experience) don’t teach it often, and when they do, its supplemental to one class a week.  If you can, ask to learn clinch and do some clinch sparring whenever there’s open training. I find its best to fight for position and if there’s an opportunity to throw a knee, do it very lightly and slowly

-When you start

-Best way to learn kicks is to do  a lot of them. And when I say a lot, so the best advice I got was to kick, kick, kick. 
Best way to do it is when you get some open training, but don’t fret too much at this stage about form). Once you hit your goal, let’s call it 250 kicks for beginners, your legs should be tired and you can now start working on form. Do one kick at a time, slowly, and think about your form, having someone with experience around would help at this point. 
This style of training works for most techniques

I love the enthusiasm that is here on /r/muaythai so I decided to share some of my thoughts with you guys about fighting and training. 

I guess to start of I have been involved in the fight game for a number of years. Fought and trained in Thailand and I'm planning BIG things this year. My trainers push me to the brink of breakdown to get what I desire and after I am so honored and grateful for that. This brings me to the first thing on my mind when I browse this sub.

* **Training:** I have seen a lot of comments inquiring about having a first fight. This I think is one of the biggest steps to some sort of a fight career and you should be equipped with as much experience as possible before stepping into a ring. Before I stepped into the ring for the first time I was already training for about 1 and 1/2 years
My first fight was a padded fight (headgear, but a lot of conditioning and clinch work. This push on mental and physical strength will leave you fatigued and demotivated. This is where your true character will blossom. This is the stage where fighters are born, not after one padded fight and certainly not after one sparring session. The fighter is born once you are physically and mentally broken but continue to fight, which leads to the *WHY*? again. A lot of people here will tell you to rest, I will tell you to gear up and carry on..because this is what we do. You cannot rest until you get that awe of winning and conquering your opponent, your own self and what ever else there is to be conquered between those four corners.

* **Why?:** 
Another serious question you must ask your self is Why? Why are you doing this? Why are you fighting? Why do you want to achieve the goals which you have set for your self? Is it simply for the fame? To be the tough guy or for the ladies? Or is there more to it than that? Do you have something to prove? This was the most important question for me and once i figured out the answer I was able to make the commitment that I will try everything to become a successful fighter on what ever scale, once you figure this step out, you will see a great improvement in your fight and training ethic. 

I hope I am not rambling to much, mentally and physically exhausting and very time consuming. There simply is not enough time for excuses and injuries. Injured shin? Hit boxing mits. Injured knuckles? Start punching with one hand. I feel like I needed to tell you guys some of these things coming from my perspective. Muay Thai is raw. If you do not pour your heart into it or you just wanna do it to boast how much of a fighter you are then, my friend, I dont think this game is for you. It will break you. If you are willing to put so much of your life into this art then prepare for a hell of a ride!

I posted on FB that 1 like= 100 bag kicks(50 each leg). My personal record for an evening was 1200 counted kicks. That was over 2 years ago and took me about 2 hours at that time to complete. As long as I was to get over 12 likes

I started at 7:00pm and finished little before 10:00pm. Every 100 I switched bags, I added a weighted vest with 30lbs attached and would alternate every 900 after. 

I've had a really tough year and last night was the first night in a while I wasn't in a dark place in my head. Setting a goal like this for an evening and being able to complete it... it's almost indescribable.

1) Learn how to hold pads. Correct position for punches and kicks is crucial. Hold with confidence and work on being speedy. If you cannot transition from holding for 1-2 to holding for swing kick quickly you will force your partner to slow down. In addition




2) Stay on the same page. If we are doing a technique that bores you or that you don't want to practice do not deviate. Respect the class and your partner and do the drills being shown. Next class there will be something interesting.



3) Engage with your partner. If they are flagging give them some motivational words, push the pace. 



4) Ask before you give advice. Dont just blurt out that your partner is doing something wrong. Ask them if you can give them a pointer. 



5) Be clean, etc. Just be clean. Geez. Wash your wraps. Brush your teeth. 



6) Use good control and keep your power appropriate when sparring. Communication is the best way to discover what is right.



7) Try to partner with someone the same size. Even though you come to the gym with your friend who is 6 inches shorter and 50 lbs heavier than you does not mean they are the ideal partner. 



8) Say thank you!



9) If it is appropriate


Any more?

I found this kind of interesting. I've only really watched the MT vs... fights, the MT guy wins because he properly pressures his opponent and his opponent doesn't know how to react and just turtles up.

I feel like the best thing MT teaches, by teaching one to stay calm, assess the threat and react accordingly. This goes for fights, school, work, life. If you train properly you're going to get much more out of MT than a work out and ability to throw kicks and elbows.

1361317375.0,18umj4,So I just had my first sparring session...,bued07,19,0,25,"After about a year joining the gym (have not been going consistently throughout, at least I know enough to go for sparring.

I did my research looking through sparring videos on youtube and reading teeps (sorry, distance, relaxing, etc...

Come crunch time, kept looking at their legs, getting overwhelmed by bigger partners (we do 2x 3min rounds with same partners then switch over the course of 1 hour), not wanting to get hit in the head, covering head and looking down on the floor while receiving an array of punches, end up having my punch ""chase"" them when they step back, very tensed, but adding the legs in the things to watch out for is a whole new level.

It wasn't all that bad though. I actually had fun. I was quite happy with my kick blocking and with a few kicks I've thrown. Most of the guys I sparred with were really helpful too. I've learned a lot and need to do a lot of work too.






So some tips for first-timers:

-wear proper protective gear (at least wraps

-it's not about beating your opponent

-give and/or ask for feedback from your partner

-keep your hands up. You will get hit

-let your partner know that it is your first time and ask him to take it easy on you if he/she's a little aggressive

-have fun and learn from the experience






Some things I struggled with:

-Distancing - how do I start off throwing a combo? I seem to be trying to reach out with my punches and kicks most of the time.

-Blocking and catching a kick - I know i should stick to blocking for now but at what situation will catching a kick be good?

-Where I look at - Is eye contact the best way (using peripherals for watching out)?






I have more things but this is getting long and might be boring. So anyway,False,self,t5_2r60y,1361317632.0,,,t3_18umj4

Against the opponents with similar experience to me I generally do decently until  cardio becomes an issue. The main problems I have are opponents rushing me and getting stuck outside when they have longer reach and more power. 

Our actual fighters and  more experienced people tend to just destroy me (which is to be expected). I can't  mount any offense and I just get stuck running away and maybe landing a few good jabs.

So I've been at the gym for around 6 months and have had a really good bond with my trainer and other students in the gym. It's been a fantastic experience..... Until last night that is.... Hoping you all can give some feedback about what I experienced last night.

There is a new trainer now. He was a professional fighter with over 60 pro fights under him and he is what I would call a ""fighter"" not a martial artist. To make this clear

Last night we (the kickboxing class) were worked very hard, queers, etc, I was called out for my shadowboxing because I wasn't punching up - And I mean called out... I told myself that I was being too sensitive over this and continued on, however later on one of the other guys even brought up that I was ripped out for this, so I felt very embarrassed. 

I've never had this kind of trainer before and I am just not happy because that style doesn't motivate me at all. I didn't walk out as much as I wanted to, to the martial arts and to the class.

I am also 39 years old and not in the best shape, usually I'm inspired and ready to go for more.

Have you had trainers like this? How did you deal with them? Am I being over sensitive? I'm looking for honest feedback here and would appreciate any insight you all have.

EDIT 11/07/12

First of all

I spoke to the head trainer briefly last night and he said he wasn't all that pleased with the language that was used, people who fight amateur/pro.... So I can understand his ""style"" now, more than I did last week. Another good thing is that the other regular trainer told me to just take anything he says ""with a grain of salt"" and that was good to hear also.

1372777104.0,1hi01t,Heavy Bag Build : Fairtex Heavy Bag w/Rubber Mulch.,Yomadafuku,20,6,5,"Friend called me up the other day asking me to get him a heavy bag. He wanted something stronger and harder than your average store bags.
He introduced me to the sport 8 years ago


I ordered him this bag last Friday night. http://www.muaythai-fighting.com/fairtex-extra-large-heavy-bag-hb3.html

It arrived on my doorstep in Australia on Monday. Came to about $200 with UPS postage.


There is a bag at my gym which has little movement but not so sore to kick like a sand bag. I asked my trainer and he told me he bought rubber gravel as fill many years ago. (Tyre rubber)


I went home and searched to no availability of rubber gravel. Though i came upon rubber mulch at a local import center. I popped down to check it out.


Wasnt as cheap as i wanted but my friend was ok with it as long as it was a good investment. After some haggling
I bought 3 bags. $135


This stuff doesnt have any hard or sharp edges. Though has good weight and flexibility.

http://imgur.com/BqlwuDP

http://imgur.com/I40efoF

http://imgur.com/DFrMeDN


Filled the heavy bag to the very top with 2 bags of rubber mulch.
So there is about 50kg of weight in the bag at the moment. 
We are going to let him work the bag for 5-6 months for the mulch to compress inside then top it up with the left over bag of rubber mulch. Hoping to bring the total weight of the bag to 75kg. This will insure less movement of the bag and make it harder.
Looking at the hessian bags the mulch came in
If this doesnt work


Bag doesn't cave in with kicks and has a real solid feel with good shin conditioning aswell. Also felt really good to do skip knees on.


Sorry no end photos


$335AUD all up to build this bag in a rush. 
Good for intermediate to start shin conditioning

While the other 2 guys are warming up for class I decide to throw some punches and elbows on the hanging bag.

I throw jab

I completely miss the bag with my right elbow.

To make matters worse

The momentum throws me to the ground.  I try to catch myself falling and basically only manage to get my right foot under me.  All my momentum lands on my heel and drives straight through to my big toe that is jammed into the ground.

I didn't realize what had just happened... other than I had put myself on the ground from completely missing a fucking inanimate object.  At this point, only to look down at my foot and realize my big toe is cocked at an angle that it shouldn't.

An hour later

So,5,6 or however many weeks this will take to heal.

Anyone have some good suggestions for alternate exercise to help keep strength and stamina up?  I know I won't be able to run, deadlifts, etc.)

 My background:

* I'm 6'1"" and 175lb

* My Muay Thai experience is a bit odd however, and after summer when I moved back to my University town I just continued my normal gym routine (weightlifting, cardio, etc.). However my gym has a heavy bag room (just a 100-200lb heavy bag swinging in a mirrored room) which I have been visiting around 1-2 times a week for the remaining 32 months that make up my Muay Thai experience. Since I've been by myself though, it is hard to push my workouts like a class does, I'm obviously missing out on a lot of key sparring, and I don't have anyone to check on my technique to keep me in line.

* I've done Ninjutsu for 2 years now as well

* I've recently got a friend into Muay Thai and I bought a pair of focus pads and we've been practicing combos and the basics back and forth

Anyways

 The mauy thai camp I've been researching is [Lanna Muay Thai](http://lannamuaythai.com/) in Chiang Mai, pads, bags, shadow boxing, drills, clinching, etc.). Does anyone have any direct experience with this place or any recommendations?

What should I expect given my experience? If I go to the camp for 2 weeks, and overall just get a feel for it?

* Whenever i asked a question i was met with "" *sigh* i don't know why this is so hard for you to understand""

* fast forward a bit

* The instructors eventually stopped showing up and only appeared when it was convenient for them

* During conditioning classes they (the instructors) would always make fun of me and tell me how i was proportionally weaker than the women in the class.

Our two coaches have to consistently stop him and correct his habits but nothing gets through to him. Hes pretty  young (highschool junior) but it seems like his ego cant be checked.

Specifically, uppercuts purely because my combination rarely ever finish or connect. My kicks are perfect and I have no problem kicking all night if need be, but as you all know, kicks on their own are useless. Often I find myself stuck in guard being pounded and seeing a hundred different openings but with no strength or energy left in my upper body to string an effective combo or even a damn jab back at my partner. When sparring begins, I can usually dole out a few quick, snappy punches and a few combos, but after a few minutes my arms are near useless or moving much too slow and using far too much energy.

I have asked my trainer and a few more experienced fighters for help regarding what to do and all have suggested to punch with some small dumbbells which will make moving my arms with only a few oz gloves on much easier. I lost my first fight because of bad hands and I am desperate to improve and become better! I've started using the dumbbells suggestion but is there anything else

I've googled into the problem

With the kids though I lose their attention after 10 minutes of combos on the bags(I usually dont have them do bagwork because of it).
It seems like half my class is there because of their parents and the other half because they enjoy it. Any suggestions for keeping them motivated to learn?

I've been a martial arts fan for many years. Finally a muay thai gym opened in my city and I started training. The coach is a very competent and good guy

The problem is

I don't know how much of this is caused by respiratory issues i have, dirty air, unfiltered by the nose cause my airway to almost completely close. But this only happens sometimes: I think that, even without this condition, i would suck, because I'm now 25 years old and i never practiced any sport previously. 

The day at my gym is that of most gyms: after a warm up session (burpees, etc) we train techniques: a day for the clinch, a day for pads work etc. Other days we go for a run or do circuits.

The problem is that i can barely finish the warm up without depleting all my energies. I trained for a whole year there now and i think it's time to stop going there and take whatever time it takes to reach a decent level, but not enough. I think my results are very mediocre for a whole year of training, and i would like to train for a while from a lower level. We are a small gym and they can't slow down the training sessions only for me. 

I'm reading ""Infinite Intensity"" because it seems to be recommended a lot and also about the ""couch to 5"" running program. I have a weight room with dumbbells and barbells

I'd like to ask you guys if you think this is a good idea and how you would start to build an athlete

When I started Muay Thai (been 5 months 2/3 times a week discounting time off) I started south paw because that's what I was used to from BJJ and Fencing (Although I snowboard orthodox).  Even so, in some respects it's gotten worse.  When I started, I would train the rear roundhouse (left) much more than the switch, so it was significantly better, but now that I've got enough reps in on both legs, my right leg (what should be my natural rear foot) is starting to surpass my left.  This is compounded by the fact that I am about 1.25 years out from ACL, MCL, so my right leg is still weaker when acting as the standing leg for my left roundhouse.  I can throw faster and maintain better technique with my switch kick now (when the Kru calls for speed kicking).  

I'm wondering if I should just convert to orthodox stance.  

Here are some of the pros I have for staying southpaw:  

1)  I had some hope of doing some amateur MMA (I'm 32

2)  The natural advantage southpaws have since orthodox are not used to facing them

3)  I like the longer distance since most times I'm facing an opposite stance.  

4)  More power in my lead hand

5)  Standing orthodox also feels a little weird now (I have no natural stance.  Damn!)

Cons:

1)  Still feels kind of weird

2)  Less power in my rear hand

3)  South paw tactics/strategies are not really highlighted during training.  Everything in taught in the orthodox stance (with southpaw being addressed as ""do the opposite"").  

So what do you guys think?  Should I switch to orthodox?  I know some people will say just learn both

We worked on a lot of clinches and throws, and Saekson is beyond fast.

One big thing Saekson pushed was setting up strikes. Fakes, all effective, but even more effective as long as you set up your next move and you can adapt to what your opponent does. To make this more effective he made sure to tell defenders to actually defend, rather than simply allowing the attacker to do their moves while you practice, keep moving, defend, throw jabs back to keep their guard up. Obvious, and helpful to actually focus on. It all seems so obvious

Saekson also made us all feel very confident,"" and discussed the benefit and joy he finds in training with people of all skill levels and styles. He mentioned Matee's two Lumpinee belts, and spoke of how he has none, but being a champ isn't everything. Training, loving the art, and never giving up are more important.

It was an amazing seminar

Just got back from the gym and I'm feeling kinda blue. I'm new to Muay Thai (although I do have a little boxing experience) and this is only my third week at the gym



Today we drilled some blocking stuff: Working with right and left hooks, we were to block our partner/""opponent""'s punches using light parrys with our hands, blocking with the palms of our gloves, and (in order to defend the hooks) blocking with our forearms and gloves raised past our head. 



During this drill, but I feel discomfort when I move it in certain ways. I'm pretty sure it's a tendon-related issue, but I have no idea what to do besides ice it. 



On top of that



The next drill we did was with Thai pads. We were to throw a jab, hopefully you know what I mean) with our left leg and throw a medium/high kick with the right leg. 



I couldn't get the push kick right at all. Going from the cross to the push kick was brain-fucking me the whole time, but I don't have another class until Monday, and we're likely not doing the same stuff again.

Now I have to admit, but body shots that you can actually feel. Also, I have to say that almost everyone I've sparred with so far, has been way more experienced than me, but REALLY took it quite easy and were very decent and kind, so totally not their fault

However

I fear that if I am already a bit fearful going into sparring knowing the other guys are friendly and are gonna go a bit easy on me

Does it get better with time / more sparring etc or am I just too much of a chicken to pursue such a sport and should just shy away at home and resent my self for eternity?

Obviously, and in some cases those people are bloody sweaty. Dripping, even. Sometimes we clinch, sometimes we train with ladies, or children. In short, sometimes we get in close contact with others' bodily fluids. And comfort levels with this vary.

So I guess what I'm interested in is how you all think and feel about it?  How do you all feel about others' sweat? Do you hate it? Not care? Think sweaty guys should wipe down?

OK so

-when I was 16 (24 now) I fucked up my left shoulder due to a fall while skateboarding. Nothing was broken, sometimes when I do unusual movements with my arm (like if I'm stretching really hard when tired, or just hanging curtains with my arms and hands up high) my shoulder just ""pops out"" (sorry I don't know the proper term for this) and there's nothing I can do for the following 2-3 minutes except move real slowly, waiting for the shoulder to pop back in on its own. Not a big deal in day-to-day life since it happens quite rarely, but I was thinking maybe this could be a problem when boxing. When throwing a left punch I can feel that my shoulder is kinda weak. Will this be an issue or will it get better/stronger over time?

-I appear to be quite flexible (or at least more than my friends, I can do a head kick to someone standing up with no problem (even though I don't have the proper technique at all). Is that really out of the ordinary, and will it really help me in muay thai? I'm just curious whether this is an advantage or not, guess it would make me slightly more confident knowing that I have at least one quality at this sport :)

I’ve seen a lot of posts in the past about people looking for good and reasonably priced proprietor for fighting equipment and I recently had to purchase some new gloves and went on a search


After a long search (I will spare you the details), if anyone cares) I’ll be doing a review of those as well if there is interest. I had been shopping around various sites and stores, but this site had, by far, the best prices (and selection) but before I purchased, I went to ebay. And wouldn’t you know it, they have an [ebay store]( http://myworld.ebay.ca/muaythai-fighting&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEFSX:SELLERID&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1543.l2533) with FREE SHIPPING. I’m going to repeat that, that’s like pouring out a bowl of lucky charms and getting all marshmallows. I should point out that I am from Canada, but when you take FREE SHIPPING into account


I had a look at their other gear and everything I saw was much cheaper than any other site or brick-store I’ve been too, even their Fairtex stuff is well priced.


The best part? I bought my stuff on a Monday, which is at least $20 cheaper than any other quality glove I have seen online. 
All items have a 30 day returns, mainly because everything went much better than expected and I never needed to contact them for anything.

So that’s my long review

I've been training Muay Thai for over two years now. It started out as just fun

It was my first fight. My opponent's third, strong kick here and there, but then he'd just overwhelm me with punches again until I clinch. The ref stopped the fight 4 seconds short of the end of the first round when I, according to him, with my back against the ropes, took too many unanswered punches. Most people said it was an early stoppage. I remember thinking in the first round how I just need to adjust my strategy with my corner and win the second. But it never came to be.

I wasn't even gassed. Or injured. OK, while the other guy looked uncontrolled and didn't practice proper form. Everyone assured me that I was better and could have won had the fight been allowed to continue. This went a bit of the way to make me feel better, but a loss is a loss. It looms heavily over me.

I had fun though. I really enjoyed it actually. Eight weeks of preparation culminated itself in only two minutes of brawling. It felt like a short rollercoaster ride. I took a few days off and upon my return to the gym I found out that in 7 weeks there is another event that several of my friends are preparing for and I decided to take part. I felt good

I started the following Monday. My trainer told me to take it easily due to having just had a fight. I reminded my sparring partner to go light three times until he threw a hard kick into my ribs when I wasn't expecting that sort of power or speed. I got out of the ring

Since then, but the pain went straight from the tip of my chin into my ear. Last night I sparred and did well, except against a sparring partner who's got super fast hands, a reach advantage and amazing head movement. I got frustrated trying to catch him while simultaneous eating tons of jabs, but I managed.

Overall

Then I think about the opponent and I consider that whoever it is can't be in a much different position from me. They train just as hard probably and statistically have no better or worse chance of winning. This uncertainty is not comforting and even though it may be realistic

I am not new to martial arts, I did tae kwon do for 10 years and had a couple golds at nationals and the us open when I was a junior as a black belt, so my kicking is at a very high level, but it's been about 5 years since training TKD so my flexibility has gone downhill. I also have 2 years of BJJ under my belt (I am 21 and currently train BJJ about 4 times a week and am a blue belt). I only had about 5 boxing lessons months ago, so I'm not even gonna try to start learning that on my own! However, I might be able to study the footwork or kicking and get a general idea of the similarities and differences with TKD and MT. I was wondering if anyone would have any tips or things to keep in mind? Also, if so I will be sure to share.

Thanks everyone,False,self,t5_2r60y,False,,,t3_l2d8k

I'm going to be an instructor some day, I'm merely a part-time student, who can barely train due to some nagging injuries. However, there comes a time when an opportunity to change your life is presented, and that opportunity has come for me. I played football for many years, stopped in college, and picked up Muay Thai in my early twenties. I had strength, and I have a competitive nature, due to my football years, and brief stints in the gym

In the midst of feeling like a POS

Step 1: Discover exactly which muscle groups are F'd up.

Step 2: Find out which MT moved did the F'ing

Step 3: Repair the muscles (massage, whatever I can get my hands on and afford)

Step 4: Get back in the gym and SLOW DOWN!!!

Step 5: Repeat

In the process of following these steps, then immediately pull a muscle in class. I can't remember how many times a muscle would release and I'd say out loud ""That's it, I think the pain is gone!"" for it to simply return the next morning. However, through it all, through all of the shame, the doubt, seeing young guys in the gym move in ways that I haven't been able to move in years, and that's how I knew I had found my life's true passion. 

In the end I discovered I had knots in my hamstrings the size of baseballs, had been tugging at my lower spine, and lower abs so weak that I'm finding it difficult to even walking properly. However, all these things are being improved upon, and I haven't been out with an injury in months. Which brings me to the next three days-I'm going to spend every waking moment immersed in doing what I love, and I'm not going to take that for granted! I'm using this as a launching point to up my endurance, sharpen my technique, it's a lifestyle. Also, but have some seemingly insurmountable hurdle in their way. I want to let you know that you can improve

**Edit:** Made it back in one piece! This weekend was a really significant turning point in my career, but I was able to stay disciplined, listened to my body, and reap the rewards.

So here is my review for  [Thaismai 16oz Velcro-strap gloves]( http://www.muaythai-fighting.com/thaismai-boxing-gloves-velcro-attached-thumb-bg-124.html)
I will need to preface this review by stating a few of my biases;
1.	I much prefer muay thai style gloves
2.	My previous pair of gloves were also Thaismai brand
3.	I ALWAYS wrap using 180” wraps (I do a Cambodian style wrap with lots of cloth on the knuckles and wrists
4.	I prefer


With that out of the way

Fit

I am a pretty tall and lanky character with wide hands, and about 19.5cm, or 7 ¾ inches from the heel of my hand to tip of my middle finger. The gloves themselves fit very nicely, my hand doesn’t feel crushed and my fingers never feel jammed up. The gloves are snug enough that I would feel comfortable using them without wraps, but have enough give that, even with 180” wraps they don’t feel tight. I should say that the first use did cause some hand cramps, but after about 3 days the gloves were broken in.
The one down side is that the wrist support on the glove itself is lacking. I am chalking this up to fact that I have little-girl wrists that are 13.5 cm (or 5.3 inches) in circumference. Other people who have tried on the gloves have had no problems. I also used to use lace-up gloves
The glove does feel a bit loose at the wrist

Feel

The gloves are 16oz, hitting pads or a bag feels good and sturdy, even without wraps. There is very good air-flow through the gloves, something I never noticed before in gloves, and it is a great feature.  It is easy to make a fist, most of the padding is on the top of the hand to the fingers, but the thumb is very well protected and sits very nicely. I tested and smashed the bag thumb-first (re-creating the good, OH SHIT!!!” style hook) and didn’t feel any discomfort (except the embarrassment of deliberately throwing a poor hook).  The thumb is attached
Kind of a side note

Performance

The gloves are well balanced for size and protection (of both wearer and opponent). They aren’t so bulky that I can’t slip them through a tight guard (a problem other fighters have mentioned with older Twins gloves), all done with 12oz gloves) the change won’t be that drastic for defensive postures. 
The Velcro strap is well designed and doesn’t (yet) protrude and scratch training partners during clinch
The fingers of the gloves have a good lip on them, legs, etc.
All in all

Final thoughts

All in all, but I really like these gloves. For the money they are great fitting, feeling and preforming gloves. My last pair of gloves was also Thaismai and I bought them in 2005. They are still perfectly wearable (the only reason I’m not still using them is they are 12oz’s and I need 16oz) so I expect I’ll get at least 8 years out of these. Not bad for less than a $70 USD investment.

If you have any questions

TL; DR:
-Good fit
-Gloves feel great
-Could have tighter wrist strap
-Excellent hand protection
-Preform well
-Based on previous experience with brand

Did anyone here build their own brackets to hang heavy bags off of a wall?  The ringside/titlemma ones are too flimsy and the metal hook grinds down in less than 6 months.  So i'm pretty much looking for ""do it myself better"" type advice or links if anyone has any!
