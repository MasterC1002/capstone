Bryan started looking into past editions

That's when things got weird. The ""freaks"" and the ""orphanage"" began to communicate directly with Bryan. They would mail him notes, and a community of folks would try to analyze the texts, ads, emails, etc and post their ideas. Bryan has long since graduated and moved away, but he still keeps up the website as much as he can.

A couple things to note: this isn't Bryan doing this. He would have been an infant or not even born when they starts. Whoever is doing this

They've got $$$. It's expensive to take out a full-page ad in the Wildcat.

They've traced the person who posts the ads to a lawyer here in Tucson. All he says is he is an intermediary for the parties.

I suggest reading the ""Mystery"" background page first

1369918981.0,1fc0sc,Ohio College Student Disappears in 1953. Strange Events and Theories Follow.,ThroneofGames,332,51,49,"*I'm hoping that this is a new one to many of you. An Ohioan


**Ronald Tammen** was a well-liked 19 year old college sophomore with an extensive resume of extracurriculars. He was a varsity wrestler, frat brother, dorm RA, and a bassist for a popular jazz band. The college was Ohio's Miami University (not to be confused with Florida's more famous University of Miami). 


**Tammen had been studying for an exam with a friend** one door down in the dorms when he returned to his own room to study for a different exam. Not much later, and Ron's wallet and some other personal items were there as well. This wouldn't seem too strange if not for the fact that his coat was also still in its place even though it was a frigid and snowy April evening. The next morning, when he still had not returned, the roommate reported him missing. Tammen's car was found in its usual spot, locked, and with his bass in the back. 


**The search that ensued** was pretty thorough. His fraternity brothers, and later, the FBI. The woods nearby were searched, a cistern on campus was drained, and even a state park 5 miles away was checked. No trace was found. 


**The following summer**


*(Note: The following events are quoted from ""Haunted Ohio"". They do not appear in the article I'm linking so I'm assuming the authorities didn't believe there to be a connection with the disappearance


**""The following fall the students were startled by a voice singing--first in a bass voice, then fading back into the woods. The second night, two students claimed to see a long-haired figure striding into the dark. The third night, a group of counselors heard the voice and gave chase across the golf course. On the fifth night a tall figure in a long black coat was chased and lost in a wooded ravine.""**


The long hair part is what intrigues me most about those encounters. I don't think long hair was very commonly worn by men in the early 1950's. Was it a person who had been living off the grid for some time?


**A wide range of theories** have been proposed to explain Tammen's disappearance. Some examples are foul play and/or amnesia, and perhaps the wildest theory is that he was recruited by the CIA.


The case remains unsolved six decades later.

Hey all, [vanished into thin air](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Jennifer_Kesse) from her apartment complex in Orlando, Florida on January 24, 2006. 

Jennifer had always been very safety-conscious; she carried a whistle and mace and was known to ""check in"" via phone calls to let family know she had reached destinations safely.

Jennifer usually left her apartment for work between 7:30 and 7:45. Her boyfriend had a meeting that morning, as she always left her phone on. Around 11AM, her employers, growing concerned over her absence and their inability to reach her, contacted her parents, who in turn contacted her boyfriend. 

Meanwhile, but the images of him are not clear.

Jennifer's family entered her apartment that afternoon and found no signs of struggle; everything looked normal. Her car was finally found two days later. Again, phone, and driver's license have never been found. There was a DVD player in the backseat -- her own. No one knows why it was there, and nobody has ever found out what happened to her.

48 Hours did a piece about her (in conjunction with Tara Grinstead) which you can [watch here](http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=4713050n).

""I got it!""/""Now I understand!"") and writes down YOGTZE(the G might be a 6) and leaves.

Later that night he shows up in his favourite pub in Wilnsdorf. He orders a beer but suddenly falls from his chair and hurts his face. Witnesses say that he was not drunk at this time.
He leaves immediately after and shows up at 1 am in Haigerseelbach where he grew up and knocked at the door of an old lady who was his former neighbour. She was known for her religiosity and he was eager to come in and have a talk with her. According to her he was talking about ""horrible incidents which will take place tonight"". At the end she didn't let him in because it was 1 am and he seemed confused.

Until here it sounds like just another guy with paranoia but here is where it gets interesting:

At 3 am two truck driver find Stoll's damaged car in the roadside ditch of the Autobahn 45 near Hagen-Süd. Both witnessed that they saw four men, stepped out of their truck and headed to the emergency telephone nearby, at the side of the road, to call for help. After that they walked over to the wreck and found Stoll in his car, he was naked and heavily injure but conscious. He said that there used to be other men with him in the car but that they hit the road. He died in the ambulance on his way to the hospital.

The police later found out that the deadly injury was not caused by the accident but that someone had driven over him

Till this day no one knows what really happened that night and what the meaning of YOGTZE is.

The Phaistos Disc was discovered by Italian archaeologist Luigi Pernier in the Minoan palace-site of Phaistos on the south coast of Crete in 1908; specifically the disc was found in the basement of room 8 in building 101 of a group of buildings to the northeast of the main palace.

It is about 15 cm (5.9 in) in diameter and covered on both sides with a spiral of stamped symbols that are unlike any signs in any writing system. There are 241 tokens on the disc, an arrow, a beehive. However, attempting to interpret them literally does not lead to any obvious decipherment of the disc. Speculation has thus arisen that the pictograms are somehow being used phonetically, perhaps in a manner similar to Egyptian hieroglyphics.

My older sister lives in Nebraska and works in counseling and rehab, I was about 8 at the time).  He was a really great guy for her, he was always kind, generous, caring, and he was great with my sister and I.  I remember when they would come to visit he would play hide-and-go-seek with us.

Many years went by and both my sister and Michael continued their jobs in the field of social work, and visited us regularly in Kansas City.  Everything seemed to be going great and they always seemed happy while visiting.  I remember going antique shopping with them, and going to used book stores - their favorite activities.

One day when I was a senior in high school my father received a phone call from one of his family members.  Michael had driven my sister to work that morning and dropped her off at 7:30 a.m., drove into a parking garage near his office, parked his car, and was never seen or heard from again.

There was no activity on his credit card, took no money, made no indication what-so-ever that he would be leaving.  He just vanished.

My sister established search parties and hung up flyers begging anyone for information they might have as to his whereabouts.  The only tip that came in was that someone at the Little King Restaurant had seen him in their store purchasing lunch hours after his office reported to my sister that he had not come into work.

Months and months went by and nothing further was learned.  When my sister had married him

This is when my sister learned that he had previously had a family in Colorado, he left Colorado, came to Nebraska, and that is when he met my sister.

A little over a year later, at night, at my college and receiving a phone call from my Mom letting me know they had found his body.

They sent his body to KU to be examined by some of the top forensic experts in the country but their findings were inconclusive.  Given his previously suicide attempt, my sister, etc. - said there was nothing at all to indicate he was depressed or that he was going to attempt suicide.  He did it two days before Valentines Day.

Little is still known about his life - what he did after leaving Louisiana, nor do we know how he left there.  There's a chance he was caught up in something none of us ever knew about, or perhaps he was just depressed and never told anyone.

You see these kinds of things on TV but you never think they'll happen so close to home.  My sister still thinks about him daily.  She has a new boyfriend

Their disappearance launched one of the biggest missing-persons hunts in Chicago history. However

Following a thaw and rain, a construction worker named Leonard Prescott found the naked bodies of the Grimes sisters behind a guard rail off German Church Road, in unincorporated Willow Springs (later incorporated as part of Willowbrook in 1960). Barbara Grimes lay on her left side with her legs slightly drawn up toward her body. Patricia Grimes covered the head of her sister. She lay on her back and her head was turned sharply to the right. 

The autopsy, it was determined that the Grimes sisters died on December 28, the day they vanished, and the cause of death was due to secondary shock resulting from exposure to low temperature. The finding was arrived at only through a process of exclusion.

Harry Glos, 1957 should have buried the bodies in snow. Therefore, according to this theory, the Grimes sisters must have been still alive until at least January 7. After publicly criticizing the investigation, Glos was fired by Coroner Walter E. McCarron on February 15, 1957.

Also, which were never fully explained. Glos theorized that Barbara Grimes had been sexually molested before she was killed and although the pathologists initially denied the claim, the Chief of Detectives confirmed on the same day Glos was fired that the Chicago crime lab had reported finding that while Barbara Grimes did have sexual intercourse around the time of the murders, there was no evidence of violence or sexual molestation.

Kidnapping:
Jacob, 1989, when a masked gunman came out of a driveway and ordered the boys to throw their bikes into a ditch and lie down on the ground. He then asked each boy his age. Jacob's brother and friend were told to run toward a nearby wooded area and not look back or else he would shoot them. After a short run, both boys did look back and saw the gunman grab Jacob by the elbow and walk him away. The whereabouts of Jacob and the identity of the gunman remain unknown.

While this part of the page being removed does cast a great deal of doubt into what it said. I would love to see an outside source confirming it. However, seeing as there were two witnesses who escaped, the abduction was performed in a fairly residential location, and there has been a continuing investigation of the event up to this day, despite the fact that there has been no real clues or indications that Jacob is alive, at least that have been made available to the public (expect of course the events in 2009).

1369194512.0,1etabp,Lord Lucan,lgf92,111,19,20,"About 8.55pm on 7 November 1974. 46 Lower Belgravia Street, 7th Earl of Lucan, wondering what the delay was.

Suddenly she is attacked by a masked man who grabbed her and told her to ""shut up"". She would later recount that it was her husband's voice. They fought for several minutes until Lucan took off his mask and admitted that he had killed the nanny. In the basement lay a cloth sack with her body inside, babbling phone call and hung up. Blood stains would be discovered on her doorstep the next morning. Lucan called his mother and asked her to look after the children, speaking of a ""terrible catastrophe"". He said he had seen his wife fighting with a man and come into the house. He then drove to Uckfield in Sussex where he visited his friend, Susan Maxwell-Scott. This would be the last sighting of Lucan.

As the police forced their way into his home, he was schooled at Eton and in the United States before serving in the Coldstream Guards in Germany as a Lieutenant. After his service, he became a banker, holidaying in the Bahamas and developing a taste for gambling. One night at the Clermont Club in London he lost £8,000 (his annual income being £12,000) in just one night. Further nights at the casino cost him £10,000. He drove an Aston Martin and was even considered for the role of James Bond that was given to Sean Connery. By September 1974, and he had taken to staying all night in casinos. In two months he ran up debts of £50, not to count private creditors.

Early morning on 8 November. Detective Chief Superintendent Roy Ranson arrives at 46 Lower Belgrave Street. Sandra Rivett is pronounced dead from blunt force trauma. A blood-stained towel is found in the bedroom. The basement stairs are drenched in blood and a pipe with bandages wrapped round it is nearby. Blood is found on leaves in the back garden. The police also show up at Lucan's second apartment. His wallet

An autopsy is conducted on Sandra Rivett. Her husband, dated 7 Nov 1964, arrive at Lucan's brother-in-law's house, with blood stains on the paper. In them, Lucan speaks of ""interrupting a fight"" and ""being accused of hiring the man that killed Sandra"". He says he's going to lie low, and that for his children ""knowing their father had stood in the dock for attempted murder would be too much"". He also leaves instructions on paying the bank back with a pre-arranged auction of his property. He signs the second letter ""The other creditors can get lost for the time being. Lucky."" It would be the last anyone would hear from Lucan.

The Ford Corsair that Lucan had driven away from London was found abandoned in Newhaven, a friend of Lucan's from the gambling circuit, received a letter a day later from Lucan stating that he ""had had a traumatic night of unbelievable coincidence"". Ranson suspected that Lucan had committed suicide, and searched the area around the town and its harbour for any remains but found none. A warrant for Lucan's arrest was issued on 12 November and circulated by Interpol. The pipe in the car had traces of blood from Sandra Rivett.

At the inquest into the death of the nanny, I've just escaped from being murdered"" and ""my children, my children, he's murdered my nanny"" without mentioning a name. Death was caused by blunt head injuries and inhalation of blood. Susan Maxwell-Scott testified that when she had seen Lucan he seemed ""dishevelled, with his hair a little ruffled"". Lucan had told her that he was walking, or passing by the house when he saw Veronica being attacked by a man. He let himself in but slipped in a pool of blood at the bottom of the stairs.

The inquest's jury returned a verdict that Lucan had murdered his nanny. However Lucan's friends protested his innocence. No fingerprints of his were found at the scene and no letter mentioned the lead pipe left in the Ford Corsair. The evidence against him was somewhat compelling; he claimed to have seen a man attacking Sandra in the basement

Lucan was last seen at 1.15am on 8 November 1974, rumours that the Earl had moved to South Africa persisted. Lucan's brother insisted that this was the case. Another rumour was that he had travelled to Switzerland, where he was killed for shady financial dealings with the ""Clermont Set"". Since then, sightings have been reported in France, Colombia, India, New Zealand, Namibia and South Africa. 

Some questions:

* Did Lucan murder the nanny? If so

* Why did Lucan insist his innocence despite the breadth of evidence against him?

* How did he escape the country without a passport

* Why would he be so stupid as to leave a murder weapon in an abandoned car?",,t5_2wvvc,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1etabp/lord_lucan/

Two years before this, a remote sheep station 500 miles north east of Perth. 

This is how Bill Bryson described it:


&gt;  At 11:03 PM local time on May 28, elsewhere reported as measuring 3.9 on the Richter scale, was detected near the Banjawarn sheep station in remote western Australia. The few observers in the area reported seeing a flash in the sky and hearing an explosion. 
    The blast was 170 times more powerful than the biggest mining explosion ever recorded in the region and was consistent with a meteorite strike
    In 1995,000-acre property in western Australia near the site of the mysterious boom. 
    The cult has two former Soviet nuclear engineers in its ranks, eh?

**Background:**

The [Isabella Stewart Gardener Museum](http://www.gardnermuseum.org/home/) was established in 1903 by Isabella Gardener- a Bostonian socialite, Isabella had dedicated her life to collecting works of art and artifacts from across Europe and America with the help of art historian Bernard Berenson.  Featuring works by Boticelli, Rembrandt, Titian, Vermeer, John Singer Sargent (who was a personal friend), Matisse, and others

**The Theft:**

In the early morning hours after St. Patrick's Day 1990, until actual Boston police reported to the scene the following morning.  The frames holding the paintings are still hanging empty today as a reminder of the theft and in accordance with Isabella's request not to alter her arrangement of the collection.

**The Stolen Works:**

Thirteen total works were stolen: 

* [The Concert](http://historicartgallery.com/store/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/V/e/Vermeer-Pic0022.jpg_4.jpg) by Vermeer (a renowned 17th century Dutch painter with a surprisingly small body of known works)

**Investigation and recent discoveries:**

Many people have pointed the finger towards Whitey Bulger and the Boston mob, which was upped to 5 million in 1997- and a large reward often drums up plenty of false accusations.  Some have speculated that FBI corruption has to do with why this theft has gone so long unsolved.  In March or 2013, the FBI released information that it has tied the Philadelphia mob to the theft, though it hasn't released any information about specific persons involved and the artwork has yet to be recovered.  The FBI expressed that they feel the investigation is in it's final stages- but I will consider this mystery unresolved until names are named and the whereabouts of the artwork are revealed.

Then Tommy Willetts, who told the police. Their investigation uncovered the more–or–less entire skeleton of a young woman within the tree. Her mouth was stuffed with taffeta, and a gold wedding ring and some crepe shoes were found nearby – but perhaps most chillingly of all, one of her hands was missing. This, it was suggested, was a classic sign of a black–magic execution.

Subsequent examination – by the well–known forensic scientist Professor James Webster – suggested that the dead woman had been 35, with asphyxiation the probable cause. Exhaustive trawls through dental records and missing–person files proved unexpectedly fruitless, and the press were briefly enthralled.

Calvi fled the country via Venice and private jet and was found dead 8 days later, his secretary threw herself out of her office window in Milan and fell to her death.

Calvi's death was first ruled a suicide, but among a great deal of suspicion. 

A mafia informer claimed in 1991 that Calvi was murdered by them as punishment due to their money being lost along with the vatican's

Although so much evidence points to the mafia, Banco Ambrosiano allegedly funding Nicaraguan Contras, anti-government Polish trade unions, and even suggestions of connections to the death of Pope John Paul the first.

The intruders would have required commercial grade equipment as well as a sophisticated knowledge of microwave and broadcasting technology. Many have suspected University of Chicago or Columbia College students of being behind the video piracy -- perhaps an unhappy broadcast engineering student who was an intern with WGN-TV.

The Antikythera mechanism (/ˌæntɨkɨˈθɪərə/ ANT-i-ki-THEER-ə or /ˌæntɨˈkɪθərə/ ANT-i-KITH-ə-rə) is an ancient analog computer[1][2][3][4] designed to calculate astronomical positions. It was recovered in 1900–1901 from the Antikythera wreck, he did not find any additional remains of the Antikythera mechanism. The construction has been dated to the early 1st century BCE. Technological artifacts approaching its complexity and workmanship did not appear again until the 14th century CE, when mechanical astronomical clocks began to be built in Western Europe.[7]

Professor Michael Edmunds of Cardiff University

""This device is just extraordinary, I have to regard this mechanism as being more valuable than the Mona Lisa.""—30 November 2006

The Antikythera mechanism is kept at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens. It is now displayed at the temporary exhibition about the Antikythera Shipwreck, Michael Wright, the Thessaloniki University and Dionysios Kriaris. Other reconstructions are on display at the American Computer Museum in Bozeman, Montana, the Children's Museum of Manhattan in New York, in Kassel, Germany

The mechanism was housed in a wooden box approximately 340 × 180 × 90 mm in size and comprised 30 bronze gears (although more could have been lost). The largest gear

When the boys were not dropped off at day care the following day, Josh.

Josh returned to the family home around 5 p.m. that day with the kids

Then things got weird.

According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Susan_Powell):

&gt;Police and neighbors labeled Susan's disappearance ""suspicious"" and authorities began investigating.[23] Authorities searched the Powell home on December 9, and a handwritten letter from Susan describing a turbulent marriage and expressing that she feared for her life.[24] Documents released in 2013 indicate that DNA testing on blood found in the home in 2009 did not match either Josh Powell or Charles Cox who were tested at the same time indicating the blood came from an ""unknown male contributor."" [25]

&gt;Police interviewed Josh Powell and their 4-year-old son, a teacher reported that Charlie said his mother was dead.[24] The parents of Susan Powell said that while at daycare several months after Susan's disappearance, Braden drew a picture of a van with three people in it, and told caregivers that ""Mommy was in the trunk.""**[28]

Josh got a lawyer and stopped cooperating with the police.  He moved to Puyallup

In 2010, described as the ""official web site of Susan Powell.""  On the site, an anonymous author described Josh as a loving father and grieving husband who was the subject of a smear campaign.  Naturally, it is suspected that Josh and/or his father were behind the site.

Steve was later arrested on child pornography and voyeurism charges - one charge in particular was a bit disturbing.  He was accused of secretly videotaping Susan Powell.

Because of these disturbing allegations, asked a court to grant him custody of the children.

Then, the social worker who accompanied them made a call to 911.  She said that Josh had grabbed the kids away from her and locked her out of the house. She called 911, telling the operator that she smelled gas fumes and feared for the kids' safety.  The operator didn't send the police out right away, instead interrogating the social worker and telling her that ""We have to respond to emergency life-threatening situations first.""

And then the house exploded.

The subsequent investigation showed that the explosion had been deliberately planned. Although Josh and the two boys had officially been determined to have died from carbon monoxide poisoning

Steven Powell was informed about their deaths while he was in jail but didn't seem surprised in the least.  He has maintained his silence on the topic of Susan's disappearance.

* 12:57 am: $200 was withdrawn from Luna's bank account from the ATM at the JFK Plaza service center near Newark

* 03:20 am: his debit card bought gas at the Sunoco King of Prussia service plaza.

* 04:04 am: his car exited the turnpike at the Reading-Lancaster interchange. The toll ticket had a spot of his blood on it suggesting that he was already injured. His car was parked at the back of the Sensenig &amp; Weaver Well Drilling company at 1439 Dry Tavern Road

* 05:00 am: the first employee of Sensenig &amp; Weaver arrived.

* 05:30 am: the car was noticed

Finally, the fact that there was blood pooled in the back seat of his car may indicate that he was a passenger at some point during the journey and not a driver.

The following is from the Charley Project:

7 month old Gabriel Johnson went missing in San Antonio in December of 2009 after being abducted by his mother, Arizona. They stayed in two motels between December 22nd and 27th, the day he was last seen with his mother. That same day Elizabeth boarded a greyhound bus without her baby, leaving her car behind. She was supposed to appear in a custody hearing in Arizona on December 28th, but never showed up. She was arrested in a Miami, Florida hostel on December 30th and indicted for custodial interference, kidnapping

On December 27th, she denied harming their child and that was just trying to upset Logan.

Elizabeth claimed that she had given Gabriel to a childless couple for adoption whom she had met in a San Antonio park. She said she spent three days with the couple

At the time of his disappearance, Logan refused to give up his parental rights and he felt like the couple was trying to coerce him into agreeing to the adoption. The man and woman are considered persons of interest in the disappearance because they were the last people to see Gabriel in Arizona. Authorities felt they might know more about Gabriel's location than they are admitting. They had supported Elizabeth throughout the ordeal and believe Gabriel is safe and might be returned if Logan agreed to relinquish custody to them.

While she maintains her innocence, and conspiracy to commit custodial interference in May of 2012.

A private investigator hired by Logan McQueary believes Gabriel is stil alive and was given away or sold by Elizabeth. He claims to have evidence that a third party arranged for Elizabeth to meet this couple and give Gabriel to them. He described a man and woman as being in their thirties or forties. He believes the couple probably knew the adoption wasn't legal

An adoption expert stated the Homegate Hotel

The last known photographs of Gabriel were taken on Elizabeth's cell phone and show him holding a medicine bottle

Elizabeth confessed to Gabriel's murder a number of times

This wikipedia [article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe) gives you the basics.  The thing that gnaws at me is trying to imagine how the first people even came up with the idea to create this enormous complex with intricate carvings and pictograms.  How would you pay someone to do this before there was money? Before there was farming?  Before we even settled into villages?  

I just want to point out a few of the choice bits from that link.

*  &gt;The reliefs depict lions, foxes, gazelles, donkeys, snakes and other reptiles, insects, arachnids, particularly vultures. (At the time the shrine was constructed

*  &gt;The discovery of a predator—a crocodile, very muscular, shown with teeth bared and featuring a long tail that nearly doubles back on itself—has excited special interest for being carved nearly in the round—hinting at a degree of social diversification and artistic training again unexpected in a community still mainly dependent on hunting for subsistence.

*  &gt;The site was deliberately backfilled sometime after 8000 BCE: the buildings were buried under debris, and animal bones that must have been imported from elsewhere.

Yeah, this is not like a rival group came in, killed everyone and then tried to destroy the place.  Everything was in perfect order when it was, suddenly without apparent reason, completely filled in with **imported** debris. Think about it, there isn't any trash laying around because before you created this, nobody has been living together in groups large enough or long enough to create the amount detritus necessary to handle this job. 

*  &gt;But the complex was not simply abandoned and forgotten to be gradually destroyed by the elements. Instead, and stone tools; many animal, even human, bones have also been identified in the burial refuse.[24] Why the enclosures were backfilled is unknown, but it preserved them for posterity.

*  &gt;All statements about the site must be considered preliminary, very little evidence for residential use has been found. Through the radiocarbon method, the end of Layer III can be fixed at c. 9000 BCE (see above); it is believed that the location could have served as a spiritual center prior to 11,000 BCE or even earlier.

*  &gt;Thus, and the invention of writing or the wheel; they were built before the so-called Neolithic Revolution, i.e., the beginning of agriculture and animal husbandry around 9000 BCE. But the construction of Göbekli Tepe implies organization of an order of complexity not hitherto associated with Paleolithic, PPNA, or PPNB societies. Archaeologists estimate that up to 500 persons were required to extract the heavy pillars from local quarries and move them 100–500 meters (330–1,640 ft) to the site.[22] The pillars weigh 10–20 metric tons (10–20 long tons; 11–22 short tons), this would be the oldest known evidence for a priestly caste—much earlier than such social distinctions developed elsewhere in the Near East.[4]

*  &gt;Göbekli Tepe is regarded as an archaeological discovery of the greatest importance since it could profoundly change our understanding of a crucial stage in the development of human societies. ""Göbekli Tepe changes everything, says that ""Göbekli Tepe is the most important archaeological site in the world."" It seems that the erection of monumental complexes was within the capacities of hunter-gatherers and not only of sedentary farming communities as had been previously assumed. In other words, as excavator Klaus Schmidt puts it, ""First came the temple, then the city.""

*  &gt;Not only its large dimensions, is 500 years later, its T-shaped pillars are considerably smaller, and its shrine was located inside a village; the roughly contemporary architecture at Jericho is devoid of artistic merit or large-scale sculpture; and Çatalhöyük, perhaps the most famous of all Anatolian Neolithic villages, is 2,000 years younger.

*  &gt;Schmidt has engaged in some speculation regarding the belief systems of the groups that created Göbekli Tepe, whereas he sees a fully articulated belief in gods only developing later in Mesopotamia, associated with extensive temples and palaces. This corresponds well with an ancient Sumerian belief that agriculture, animal husbandry, and weaving had been brought to mankind from the sacred mountain Du-Ku, which was inhabited by Annuna deities, very ancient gods without individual names. Schmidt identifies this story as a primeval oriental myth that preserves a partial memory of the emerging Neolithic.[26] It is also apparent that the animal and other images give no indication of organized violence, there are no depictions of hunting raids or wounded animals, snakes

We cannot ""read"" the pictograms, and do not know for certain what meaning the animal reliefs had for visitors to the site; the variety of fauna depicted, from lions and boars to birds and insects, makes any single explanation problematic. As there seems to be little or no evidence of habitation, and the animals pictured are mainly predators, the stones may have been intended to stave off evils through some form of magic representation; alternatively they may have served as totems.[29] ... Human burial may or may not have occurred at the site. The reason the complex was eventually backfilled remains unexplained. Until more evidence is gathered

An unidentified man is found dead on an Australian beach with no obvious cause of death. 

In a fake pocket sewn into his trousers is found a small piece of paper with the words ""Tamam Shud"". A phrase found on the last page of The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.  A photograph of the scrap of paper was sent to interstate police and released to the public, in the back seat of his unlocked car that had been parked in Jetty Road Glenelg about a week or two before the body was found.

In the back of the book were faint pencil markings of five lines of capital letters with the second line struck out. The strike out is now considered significant with its similarity to the fourth line possibly indicating a mistake and thus

WRGOABABD

~~MLIAOI~~

WTBIMPANETP

MLIABOAIAQC

ITTMTSAMSTGAB

Also found in the back of the book was an unlisted telephone number belonging to a former nurse who lived in Moseley St, at the Clifton Gardens Hotel in Sydney, had given it to an army lieutenant named Alfred Boxall who was serving in the Water Transport Section of the Australian Army.

Police believed that Boxall was the dead man until they found Boxall alive with his copy of The Rubaiyat (a 1924 Sydney edition)

* Who was the dead man?
* What was the link between the dead man and Taman Shud?
* Was he a spy?
* What was the link if any between the dead man and the nurse?
* What dead he die of?
* What does the code mean?

So many unanswered questions!

But after awhile, the police did not believe them and thought they killed Walton. The group agreed to a polygraph test, and they answered a variety of questions, ranging from ""Did you harm Walton?"" to ""Did you actually see a UFO?"" The men answered truthfully, and the test concluded that they were telling the truth. The police said that the polygraph test **was** conclusive.

But this is where it gets truly weird. Almost a week later, and the caller said in a weak voice (according to the husband) ""This is Travis. I'm at a phone booth at the Heber gas station, and I need help. Come and get me."" At first, the husband thought the caller was another prankster, and was about to hang up until the caller spoke again, saying in an almost hysterical and screaming voice ""It's me, Grant … I'm hurt, so he believed him.

Walton was reportedly found at the Heber gas station, pale, and had not shaven. He was picked up by his sibling and his sister's husband. According to them, Walton seemed panicky and anxious. When Walton returned home, his mother said that Walton could not eat. When Walton tried to eat, he would vomit.

When Walton was told he was missing for a week

Walton was sent to have a medical exam, according to what Walton said, then his body would've broken down his fat to sustain him, which would've caused his urine to have a lot of ketones.

Walton reported that after approaching the UFO, and had trouble breathing, but his first thought was that he was in a hospital.

As his faculties returned, and they had bald heads, no hair. Their heads were domed, very large. They looked like fetuses [...] They had large eyes — enormous eyes — almost all brown, without much white in them. The creepiest thing about them were those eyes … they just stared through me."" Their ears, noses and mouths ""seemed real small, maybe just because their eyes were so huge.""

Walton related that he feared for his safety and got to his feet, so instead waved it at the creatures as a weapon. The trio of creatures left him in the room.

(I'll stop with the UFO bits. It goes on for a while. Don't want to make this too long!)

After everything settled down

The Travis Walton mystery is considered the best proof for alien abductions. It remains as one of the best-known instances of alien abduction.

Here is a few from the Listverse article mentioned above.
&gt;Authorities initially theorized that Edward might have become disoriented and drove off a nearby bridge into the Chicago River. However, but none of them were the Andrewses’ Oldsmobile. The case took a different turn in 1994 when an informant told police that Edward and Stephania had been murdered that night by gang members, who placed the couple’s bodies in their car and submerged it in a pond near Green Oaks. However, a search of the pond turned up nothing. After more than 40 years, it’s still unknown what happened to Edward and Stephania Andrews that night.

**My Opinions From Research**
Inside of their house there was nothing missing or out of place.
All of their stocks
They were described as a happy couple at the time.

Looking into an article it talks of the man who reported they were in the lake/pond
But

1373949038.0,1ie4mp,Long Island City Torso Mystery,fwizard226,57,13,20,"I stumbled on this fascinating unsolved mystery while doing genealogy research. I’ll start out with a brief summary of some of the facts I’ve gathered

**The Body**
The head and torso of a young woman were found on the morning of October 22 1921 in a pond in Long Island City. A green belt was knotted around her neck, torn from blue serge fabric.  She was thought to be around 20 years old, likely poor, and probably of German or Polish decent. The police speculated that she was killed elsewhere and driven to the pond, where she was likely dumped on Friday night. 

**Clues**
A few witnesses came forward.  These include:

- Three witnesses saw a man in uniform carrying a heavy bundle Tuesday night near the pond (although it is noted that this may be unrelated

- A man tells police he saw a man in a uniform with a peaked cap (possibly chauffeur livery) draw a bundle from a large touring car on Tuesday night.  This does coincide with the earlier statement from the three previous witnesses.

- A couple saw a touring car and movie van on the Wednesday night before the body was found. The touring car had its lights on

**Possible Identities**
Here’s where I think the story gets really interesting.  Multiple people came to identify the body.  Here are two that I found interesting:

- A woman came in claiming to be Mrs. Elizabeth Richards.  She claimed the body was that of Bertha Baker (or Becker), Mr. Richards tells police the woman who claimed to be Elizabeth Richards was an imposter, since his wife was in the hospital.  The real identity of the woman was never revealed.  When the legs were finally discovered, there were no tattoos.

- Arnold A. Wagstaff identifies the body as that of his wife, a chauffeur, said Mary Agnes would often stay out late, past when he would return home from work.  She left him in July, leaving a note that said she would be back for her clothes (she never got them).  She was around town with an Italian man who worked at a fruit stand. Wagstaff last saw her on August 19th, and he urged her to return home.  She refused.  
 
Okay

 The [article about Arnold A. Wagstaff](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A07E0D8103CE533A2575AC2A9669D946095D6CF) is what interests me the most, but subsequent articles do not mention Wagstaff or Mary Agnes at all (or at least that I’ve been able to find), which is confusing to me.  No mentions of even why police may have moved on.  The article also mentions that Wagstaff works as a chauffeur (many of the witnesses thought they may have seen a touring car and chauffeur with a bundle near the crime scene), and it sounds from the article like he may have had reason to feel spurned by his wife.  

Some other things I can add from census data. In 1923, so I’m not sure what exactly happened with Mary Agnes that the marriage officially dissolved (again, I need more research here). Census data also shows that by 1925 Arnold was a patrolman with the New York Police Department.  Additionally, as far as pure family rumor goes, my grandfather and his brother have both said that their father was a mean, violent man.  All of this I’ve found about him makes me…a little suspicious.

So to bring this all to a conclusion, like I said, there’s a whole lot more that there isn’t room to mention.  I would love to hear what you guys think, and if anyone can dig up any more information.

Oak Island is noted as the location of the so-called Money Pit and the site of over 200 years of treasure hunting. Repeated excavations have reported layers of apparently man-made artifacts as deep as 31 metres (102 ft)

There has been wide-ranging speculation amongst enthusiasts as to who originally dug the pit and what it might contain. Later accounts say that oak platforms were discovered every 10 feet (3.0 m), Robert Dunfield (a trained geologist) wrote that he carefully examined the walls of the re-excavated pit and was unable to locate any evidence of this tunnel.

The cipher stone, while others claim it was last seen as a doorstep in a Halifax bookbinder's shop. The accuracy of the translation, whether the symbols as commonly depicted are accurate, or if they meant anything at all, remains disputed. Barry Fell, the author of the controversial books America B.C. and Saga America, was sent a copy of the inscription by the chief archivist of the Nova Scotia Archives in the late 1970s. Fell, concluded that the symbols were similar to the Coptic alphabet and when translated implied that the people needed to remember their God or else they would perish.

Man-made structures under Oak Island do in fact exist as discussed in many books, or are the remains of prior excavation attempts, is unknown.

His involvement in the original bitcoin protocol does not appear to extend past mid-2010. There was an investigation, linking 3 persons authoring the patent to bitcoin. They have denied any involvement, but so far that is the most elegant solution.

I would like to offer mine. Based on the original code's complexity, there are 1.1 million early Bitcoins never been used, just sitting in wallets, collecting dust. This is one of the most interesting aspects of Bitcoin, and my theory would explain it.

If we put these facts together

1. Why? A government social experience for various reasons:

a/ To see if people are receptive to the idea and if so

b/ To fund agents abroad.

c/ To follow and capture criminals/terrorists

d/ Cryptocurrency might be the future

e/ Whatever they discover through the process the agency can use it for cryptology.

f/ If they crash the market at a later date
/etc.etc.

2. How? The NSA has a huge stuff with top notch brain power. Using their work time and their salaries they had the time

3. Why did Nakamoto disappear? Once the thing started to take off and there were enough enthusiasts who did the coding

4. Why the 1+ million coins haven't been used or even transferred? If they were mined on government computers using government employees, that is currently 10% of the existing coins, a large enough amount to bring the whole project down, if they enter the market with it.
   Had the original creator wanted to popularize the bitcoins, he should have sold at east some part of it, because nobody really knows just how high the coins' value can go. Some of the early coins also could have been lost, but I don't think 1.1 million of them...

Detectives saved her clothing as evidence, now including Hickock and Smith.

Deputies know this much: Christine Walker — Christine Myers when she was a comely majorette at DeSoto High School — was killed alone in her home.

Her husband and children arrived a few minutes later to an apparent ambush.

Cliff Walker, dying instantly and falling backward, his white cowboy hat still on his head.

Jimmie, was shot in the head and died at his father's feet. Curly-haired Debbie was shot but didn't die immediately, leading her killer to draw a few inches of water in the family bathtub and drown her. She was found facedown in the water the next morning.

Detectives early in the investigation ruled out Hickock and Smith based on polygraph results and fingerprints taken after their Dec. 30 arrest in Las Vegas.

Richey Edwards was a member of the Manic Street Preachers who disappeared on the 1st February 1995. In the two weeks before his disappearance, London at seven in the morning, and then drove to his apartment in Cardiff, Wales. In the two weeks that followed he was apparently spotted in the Newport passport office, and the Newport bus station.

On February 7, including Blackwood (Edwards' home as a child). The passenger got off at the Severn View service station near Aust and paid the £68 fare in cash. On February 14, Edwards' Vauxhall Cavalier received a parking ticket at the Severn View service station and on February 17, the vehicle was reported as abandoned. Police discovered the battery to be flat, with evidence that the car had been lived in.

Due to the service station's proximity to the Severn Bridge (which has been a renowned suicide location in the past) it was widely believed that he took his own life by jumping from the bridge.

They had both been shot to death. Knobling and Edwards were both partially clothed. Knobling was wearing jeans. The belt on Edwards' jeans was not fastened. Her bra was around her neck, under her blouse. Edwards' and Knoblings' underwear were both found in the truck. Police believe they were marched from the truck to the river where they were executed and dumped.

In **April of 1988**, meaning they left the car completely nude. There was no sign of a struggle. Neither body has been found, but they are presumed dead.

In **October 1989**, the keys were in the ignition and the gas tank was three-quarters full. Ms. Phelps' purse was in the car and some of Lauer's clothing was found in the car. Their bodies were found less than a mile from the rest stop. Although the state of decomposition made it difficult to determine a cause of death, police believe they were stabbed to death.

Other possibly linked victims are Brian Craig Pettinger, who was discovered on April 2, 1988 along the James River. Ms. Powell had been stabbed multiple times.

In addition, the bodies of Michael Margaret and his girlfriend, Donna Lynn Hall, were found in a wooded area just west of Richmond, Virginia. They were about 70 feet from Michael Margaret's Jeep. They had been stabbed multiple times and their throats had been slashed. There was no apparent motive. Margaret's Jeep, found near the bodies, held suitcases and a cooler. The couple had told friends that they were going camping.

**In January 2010**, no one has been identified as the killer. Investigators have speculated that suspect might be a law enforcement officer or perhaps a rogue operative from the Central Intelligence Agency, which has a training facility nearby at Camp Peary in York County.

At the same time the FBI was reopening the case, who were found murdered 180 miles west in Shenandoah National Park in 1996. He even developed a profile of this killer. His findings were published in an article titled, ""Predators on the Parkway.""

I didn't know Michelle Vanek or her family personally

For many of us that live in the Denver metro area,000 feet. These are known as fourteeners, and are more challenging given the thinner air, the likelihood of experiencing altitude sickness, the distances one must climb to reach the summit, and the rapidly changing weather conditions above treeline. Some fourteeners require nothing more than a stroll up a path to summit, others require greater technical skill and fitness.  Top physical condition does not guarantee a hiker won't experience acute mountain sickness (AMS), nausea, foul weather

Many mountaineers would argue that Mount of the Holy Cross is not an ideal first fourteener. There are many other easier fourteeners to climb

In some ways, Eric Sawyer, to accompany her. Her clothing for the day was a little light but not necessarily inappropriate for the season - a jacket and pants, a hat and gloves, hiking poles and a CamelBak backpack.  Anyone who hikes regularly has seen people on more difficult hikes who were not as well-equipped. Most who hike fourteeners regularly would carry more clothing and equipment than Michelle carried that day.

Things quickly started to go wrong on the hike. The sign indicating which trail was the easier [North Ridge Route] (http://14ers.com/routemain.php?route=holy1&amp;peak=Mt.+of+the+Holy+Cross) and which trail was the more arduous [Halo Route] (http://14ers.com/routemain.php?route=holy3&amp;peak=Mt.+of+the+Holy+Cross) was reportedly being replaced by park services. At 6:30 AM Eric and Michelle started up the Halo Route, and the up-and-down path of the last few miles.  By the time they realized their mistake, they didn't want to turn back because it would mean failing to summit. They also soon realized that Eric had left their lunches and his water purifier in the car. Eric and Michelle carried no maps, no compass, no GPS, and no personal locator beacon. There is no shortcut down the Halo Ridge Route that doesn't involve climbing over a mountain or taking a very steep off-route slope down.

By the time Eric and Michelle reached the top of Notch Mountain on the way to Holy Cross

By 1:25 PM, many mountaineers would take that risk rather than hike for several hours without water.

Within half a mile (and 500 feet of altitude gain) of the top of Mount of the Holy Cross, arriving at 1:42 PM. He called his wife to let her know they were running late, briefly visited with a couple of other hikers and snapped pictures of each other, and after spending a total of five minutes at the summit he headed down the North Ridge Route to meet Michelle.

He never found her. 

Hundreds of mountaineers searched for Michelle for the following week, as a shotgun was found in a duffel bag on the mountain and there were reports of a suspicious man in the area, but there was not enough evidence to lead to any conclusion. The largest search party in Colorado history was unable to find any sign of Michelle Vanek.

**TL;DR: Mother of four disappeared on mountain almost eight years ago. No trace has ever been found.**

The Roanoke Colony on Roanoke Island in Dare County, was a late 16th-century attempt by Queen Elizabeth I to establish a permanent English settlement. The enterprise was financed and organized originally by Sir Humphrey Gilbert, who drowned in 1583 during an aborted attempt to colonize St. John's, Newfoundland. Sir Humphrey Gilbert's half brother Sir Walter Raleigh would gain his brother's charter from Queen Elizabeth I and subsequently would execute the details of the charter through his delegates Ralph Lane and Richard Grenville, Raleigh's distant cousin.

The final group of colonists disappeared during the Anglo-Spanish War

I am of the opinion that the settlers voluntarily decided to integrate themselves with one of the local Native American tribes. Without any supplies for three years

Another compelling factor is there were no signs of destruction to the colony. It appeared to have been dismantled in an orderly fashion. This makes some random and sudden event to cause the disappearance unlikely

During a 13-month period
Fear and near mass hysteria swept southeastern Michigan as young people were inundated with information on ""stranger danger"", where children could go if they felt uncomfortable. Children even avoided using a playground directly behind the Birmingham police station.  One incident in Livonia involved a tow-truck driver who assaulted a man he had seen asking two boys on the street for directions. He turned out to be a tire salesman on a business trip from Akron, Ohio, who had gotten lost with no knowledge of the slayings. The Detroit News offered a $100,000 reward for the killer's apprehension. 

Detroit's two daily newspapers, entitled Winter's Fear: The Children, the Killer, the Search, won a 1977 Peabody Award.



**Victims**


**Confirmed**

* Mark Stebbins, was last seen leaving an American Legion Hall on Sunday afternoon, February 15, 1976. He had told his mother he was going home to watch television. His body was found on February 19, neatly laid out in a snowbank in the parking lot of an office building at Ten Mile Road and Greenfield in Southfield (some reports claim Oak Park; Greenfield is the boundary between the two cities). He had been strangled and sexually assaulted with an object. Rope marks were seen on his wrists. He was fully clothed in the outfit he was wearing when last seen alive.


* Jill Robinson, packed a backpack and ran away from her home on Wednesday, December 22, 1976, following an argument with her mother over dinner preparations. The day after her disappearance, her bicycle was found behind a hobby store on Main Street in that city. Her body was found on the morning of December 26, along the side of Interstate 75 near Big Beaver Road in Troy. She was killed by a single shotgun blast to the face. She was fully clothed and still wearing her backpack. The body was placed within sight of the Troy police station, laid out neatly in the snow.


* Kristine Mihelich, was last seen Sunday, January 2, 1977 at 3:00 pm at a 7-Eleven store on Twelve Mile Road at Oakshire in Berkley, purchasing a magazine. A mail carrier spotted her fully clothed body 19 days later on the side of a rural road in Franklin Village. She had been smothered. The body was laid within view of nearby homes, eyes closed and arms folded across the chest, once again in the snow.


* Timothy King, skateboard in hand, to buy candy at a drugstore on nearby Maple Road on Wednesday, March 16, 1977, at about 8:30 pm He left the store by the rear entrance, which opened to a parking lot shared with a supermarket, and there was widespread media coverage, begged the abductor to release his son unharmed. In a letter printed in the Detroit News, two teenagers in a car spotted his body in a shallow ditch alongside Gill Road


**Suspected**

There were other abductions and murders around the Oakland County area within the same period. These are not specifically tied to the four victims above due to variations in the cases.

* Cynthia Cadieux, 1976. Missing from Roseville, she was discovered nude and battered in Bloomfield Township in the early morning hours of January 16.


**Disproved**

* Sheila Srock, 1976. Her assailant had burglarized several homes in the neighborhood earlier in the evening. A neighbor had watched the entire attack in horror from his roof, where he was shoveling snow. Oliver Rhodes Andrews confessed to, and was convicted of the murder of Srock, and is serving a life sentence in prison.

Most cases can be chalked up to people getting lost and succumbing to the elements, sometimes over mountains or across rivers that would be seemingly impossible for someone that age to endure. Also, the overall lack of aide from the National Parks sparks suspicion as to whether or not they are hiding something.

1370265539.0,1fkuob,"The case of Michael Hughes and ""Sharon Marshall""",Countryb0i2m,50,12,2,"Michael's case begins with the abduction of his mother
The first public record available for the girl states that she was enrolled in an Oklahoma City, Arizona later during that year under the name Sharon Marshall. She gave birth to Michael in Tampa, Florida on March 21, 1988 while apparently using the alias Tonya Dawn Tadlock. It is known that Floyd used the aliases Charles Hughes and Clarence Marcus Hughes during this time; authorities believe that this was the reason Michael was given the last name of Hughes at birth. Floyd claimed to be Michael's biological father; however, DNA testing performed in the mid-1990's proved that he was not related to the unidentified woman's son. 

In another bizarre twist

Michael was placed in foster care in Oklahoma after his mother's death. His foster parents told authorities that he had limited muscle control, and his foster parents had begun adoption proceedings for him. 

Investigators began probing Floyd's background after the girl's death. They learned he was a career criminal who had been arrested in 1960 at age 17 after a gunfight with law enforcement during a burglary. Floyd had also been convicted of abducting and raping a young girl from a bowling alley in 1962. Authorities searched Floyd's truck and discovered numerous photos of Michael's mother as a child in sexually explicit poses. The photos showed the girl from approximately age four through her adolescence. Other pornographic images of young women and girls were also located in Floyd's vehicle. Floyd used the aliases Trenton Davis

Floyd abducted Michael from Indian Meridian Elementary School in Choctaw

Floyd was arrested in Kentucky two months after the child was last seen, but the government has witness statements detailing alleged confessions by Floyd regarding Michael's death. Floyd reportedly told his sister he drowned the child in a Georgia motel's bathtub in 1994. Other witnesses stated that Floyd told them he murdered Michael in the same manner, while another person claimed he saw Floyd bury Michael's body in a cemetery. Due to these allegations and Floyd's history of criminal conduct, authorities believe Michael met with foul play. Floyd has not been charged in connection with Michael's assumed death or Michael's mother's case, but he is still being investigated for his roles in the crimes.

On September 1, some of which she posted on her website. One color photo shows three boys bound and gagged. A black-and-white photo] appears to show 12-year-old Johnny Gosch with his mouth gagged, his hands and feet tied, and an apparent human brand on his shoulder. A third photo shows a man, possibly dead, who may have something tied around his neck.[12] Ms. Gosch explains that the man was alleged to be one of the ""perpetrators who molested [my] son"".[13]


Ms. Gosch updated her site to say that the first two photos had originated on a website


The identity of the children in the photos was first publicly disputed on September 13


Gentlemen
Someone has played a reprehensible joke on a grieving mother. The photo in question is not one of her son but of three boys in Tampa, made by the Hillsborough County (FL) Sheriff's Office. No charges were filed, and no wrongdoing was established. The lead detective on the case was named Zalva. This allegation should be easy enough to check out.[13]

The Babushka Lady was asked to reveal herself and turn over her film for review by the FBI and police, but many inconsistencies with both her story and the details of the day result in nearly unanimous agreement that she is not the Babushka Lady. Beverly Oliver did claim

The most chilling realization with the whole Babushka Lady Mystery is that if ever her film is revealed, or if he was framed, thus solving one of the most famous mysteries in American History.

&gt;The Vela Incident — sometimes referred to as the South Atlantic Flash — was an unidentified ""double flash"" of light that was detected by an American Vela Hotel satellite on September 22

&gt;While a ""double flash"" signal is characteristic of a nuclear weapons test, was ever publicly acknowledged, even though there were numerous passes in the area by U.S. Air Force planes that were specifically designed to detect airborne radioactive dust. Other examiners of the data, including the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), and defense contractors, have come to the conclusion that the flash was a result of a nuclear detonation. Much of the information relating to the event remains classified.

&gt;The most widespread theory among those who believe that the flash was of nuclear origins was that it resulted from a joint South African and Israeli nuclear test. The topic remains highly disputed today.

P.S. - RIP Dennis Farina

___


 It has been 61 years since Detroit

Their bodies were found gagged and shot through the head. Their cash

Alan Eberlien was at the park when the murders happened. His father sold parts for United Motors, and were set to meet the Eberliens again at Union Creek. But their 1951 Pontiac never made it that far.

“*We figured they were probably just sight-seeing around here*

While his father went to the park’s south entrance to launch the search that led to the bodies of Jones and Culhane two days later, and speed away.

“*When the car sped off

The park was nearly empty

Former Crater Lake National Park Lodge employee Lincoln Linse agrees.

Linse said he drove a truck loaded with canned goods up the steep dirt highway when he saw the Pontiac. He said he saw an abduction; four men disappeared into the woods. Two of them were dressed like businessmen.

He saw the other two men the next day.

“*I pulled in to the service station on the inside of the pumps and shortly after that

“*I could tell he had a tattoo on his arm. The tattoo was of a naked lady with a bikini*

The FBI discredited Linse as a witness in the case. Linse said his friend at the service station wouldn’t corroborate his story.

There was another hole. The overlook where Jones and Culhane’s car was found abandoned was about one mile from where their bodies were found.

**Serial killer’s alibi**

The FBI investigated serial killer Jack Santo.

“*The modus operandi of the Santos gang was always robbery

Santo had an alibi putting him in California at the time

Santo and his gang were convicted of a murder in California and executed at San Quentin. The FBI never named them suspects in the Crater Lake murders. Then the case went cold.

KATU called the FBI in Portland to get some of the documents they have on this case. A spokesperson told us they weren’t sure whether their file on the murders still exists. KATU is using the Freedom of Information Act to try and find that file.

The Russian natives, as bright as the sun, run accross the sky. Approxamately ten minutes later they heard what sounded like artillery and were knocked to the ground by a blast. The blast broke windows over one hundred miles away. It also created atmospheric pressure changes that were detected in Great Britain. For a few days after the blast the skies above both Europe and Asia glowed and the Smithsonian Observatory in the US saw that the atmosphere of Earth had become more transparent.

Expedition records of the blast area were lost during the choas caused by the Russian Civil War and Revolution if there were any at all. The first recorded exploration of the area was by a mineralogist by the name of Leonid Kulik in 1921. Kulik could find no main impact site/crater but did find many holes in the ground which he theorized were meteorite impacts but the claims were laster disproven. 

Expeditions in the 1950's and 1960's found high levels of nitrogen in the soil which was supposedly caused by acid rain that occured post-blast. They also discovered strange levels of isotopes in bogs near the epicenter of the blast.

The Scientific community has come forward with an array of possible casues for the blast the most widely accepted being an air blast caused by asteriod that entered unusually far into the Earth's atmosphere and exploded some 6-11 kilometers above the forest. Though little evidence supports this theory.
