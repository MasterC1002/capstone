1357934660.0,16e9zx,"Tip: The MOST valuable thing I've ever taught my dog was ""Look at me!""",whirlingderv,175,22,54,"I saw the suggestion to teach your dog ""Look at me!"" in a comment on a post on here about recall. I taught my dog the command in one 45-minute walk. Saying ""look at me"" just randomly at first

The benefits have been twofold: one, something he never did before the new command. The second benefit is so great that it is unbelievable... his recall is pretty good, but he *is* pitbull and beagle, so it is sometimes hard to compete with his determination, especially when he is on the scent of some small mammal... now, I shout to him ""look at me!"" which is a much easier command for him to obey, then I hold my hand out to the side, then I ask him to ""come"" and it has been working so much better. 

When he's really obsessing about a scent at the dog park, and I think that often, the treat and praise just isn't worth it to him when he thinks he might be hot on the trail of something great to chase, but it is a *lot* easier for him to decide to just pause for a second to look at me (thinking that he's guaranteed a treat just for doing that super simple task), then he sees my hand out, hears me yell ""come"" and usually, the spell of the scent is broken and he's already distracted enough from it to come to me when he ordinarily would have ignored me!

1370069812.0,1fgcyl,Put my dog down tonight after over 2 years of training,Devlik,170,24,34,"To night we had to put down Roscoe. My wife and I are deeply saddened as you can imagine. We have always had the same bright line that if our dogs cross that had to be the end. Tonight Roscoe crossed that line and bit someone in the face without warning or provocation. We were very lucky that the person got away with very minor scratches and that his eyes were missed. This situation could have been very ugly had it been a child or someone who was not as dog savvy. 

For those that have followed our work with him will know he was a rescue dog with severe neurological issues and behavioral issues that we have been working to counter for the past two years. He had major socialization issues due to being in a kennel for the first three years of his life and had never fully recovered. He was a 100lb american bulldog that was very powerful and could be very dangerous if the wheels fell off and as such anything even remotely like what happened this evening had to be taken with decisive action. Please understand this is not something we did lightly but these are the risks when you adopt a challenging dog. He had two very good years of pot roasts, and bones falling from the sky twice a day.

I loved him very much

I was walking my dog near the local college this morning, runs across the busy street, dodging cars and comes hauling ass up to me and my dog. Lucy's hackles went up and I grabbed her by the collar (she was already on a leash) before the dog got to us. He starts snapping at her and barking, while Lucy tries desperately to get to him. The lady owner is standing in her doorway watching at this point. I yelled to her to come get her dog.

She jogged across the road fast enough but by this point Lucy is flailing around, heavy dog and she has an unleashed 1 pound yapper. It would actually make the situation worse if I attempted to lift my dog in the air. I tell her, calmly at this point, that I have my dog by the collar and that she just needs to grab her dog. She then screams ""Can't you just leave!?"" Again...um. I would love to. Your unleashed dog is currently following my dog everywhere she moves and refusing to stop trying to snap at us.

After yelling and arguing with me she finally picks her dog up (by the collar no less!!). She then starts with the finger poking. Saying that if I know my dog is aggressive

So...yeah. I called the non-emergency number the second I got home. Low and behold the lady laughed and said she had, by law, and she did not. I asked her about the muzzle statement and she told me that since my dog has never bitten a human, or a dog she isn't considered aggressive and that I am not legally required to muzzle her at all.

Read here for the [background](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/16qeah/we_are_soso_sad_and_looking_for_advice_about_the/ ) of where we where a few weeks ago.  In short

We were all extremely upset at the thought of giving up our eight-month-old puppy. We knew that she was sweet but we were doing something wrong. Turns out we were doing many things wrong, I got many books, watched videos and tried to learn as much as I could before getting our puppy. Our kids were also in on the self-training. They too took books from the library and attempted to learned a lot as well.
 
We started to notice that our puppy had some aggressive tendencies
http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/xl1u4/puppy_seems_to_have_a_mr_hyde_lurking_and_is/)
[link2](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/wqq0r/is_the_biting_and_nipping_normal_for_my_puppy_it/)

Reading Dr. Dunbar and others wasn’t helping too much. Multiple friends recommended a local dog trainer, but I figured he was highly recommended and had experience in this, I did not.

Teaching our puppy to heel wasn’t going as well as I had hoped. Our trainer brought over a plastic pinch collar that seemed to not be so terrible. Our puppy reacted well with it and teaching her to heel went much smoother. However, but still she was doing OK even though there were some aggression (really puppy play) things happening that we weren’t thrilled about. This trainer gave us some advice about this, mostly to correct her with the pinch collar on. That means, when she comes at us, pull the leash sharply so she really feels it and then learns to stop that behavior (it didn’t work).  

So now the trainer is starting group class and we are excited. We figure the more socialization the better and the more training experience we get

At the second class we had the shock collar on her and a 30 foot leash. The idea is to work on ‘Come’. We call her and she starts to get a mild shock. The goal is for her to learn how to stop the pain by listening to us. So when she comes to us, but they learn fast this way and she’ll be OK. My wife didn’t get to witness this but I told her all about it in gory detail saying this was very, very wrong and I don’t know what to do.  

We decided that since her aggression and now resource guarding was getting worse and not better, checked out his credentials (not something I did with the first trainer) and asked him to come over and evaluate our situation.

The second trainer seemed very knowledgeable and caring. He was also surprised by what he saw. He was expecting to see a cowering, excited, licking and going on her back to get a belly rub.
He gave us some things to do such as focusing tasks by having the puppy stand on an apple box. He also was surprised how fast she took to that. Within about 3-5 attempts she would sit on the apple box waiting for the next command. He also told us to keep her on leash 100% of the time (we were doing that

Having since watched the video again, he saw it and called me. For weeks I wanted more timely responses from him and *now* I finally get it. In the video (which I will not post partly because of embarrassment but also I don’t need my family broadcast on the internet) my daughter is almost in the dog’s face with her phone and my son is continually tugging on her metal pinch collar to get her to stop. This is what my son was taught: if you want to stop the dog from doing something, you correct her by a quick-sharp tug on her leash. It was just terrible and it even hurts to write about it now. I dare say they were (not on purpose) torturing the dog and that I was most likely doing the same. 

So it became this vicious cycle

We show the video to the second trainer and at that point he said for our safety to have her placed somewhere else. This was too painful to bear. I guess if we really thought something was truly wrong with her, but we knew that this couldn’t be the case. I guess dogs can be schizophrenic (I really have no idea) but this didn’t feel right.

I call the rescue people that we got her from and explain the situation in long and emotional detail

So the newest trainer (number 3 if you don’t include the local pet francise store training) and I speak. She reassures me that this is a fixable situation and she wants to meet the family. She also mentioned that corrections with a pinch collar or shock collor done with a dog that has an aggressive tendency  is the opposite of what we should do. That it will in fact make them more aggressive. So before she even comes over I toss the pinch collar and get a Martingale. 

She comes over and meets our puppy who of course is sweet and loving with her. She is in love with our puppy and asks in great detail about what has been happening. She tells us that she is proud of us for not giving up and feels confident that we can get our puppy back to where we all want to be. Compared to the other trainers that we’ve been through, “drop it”, “leave it”, “get your toy” (that one especially to redirect her when she comes after us instead of going after the toy we were playing with). Also she added hand signals to our commands and said that she would send all of these instructions (which I was taking notes on) in an email a few days later, which she of course did (no one else gave us such detailed advice and followed up on it).

So two weeks have passed and we have even had our second meeting with her. What a difference! From a puppy we were told to get rid of, the proper redirection, the consistency and I’m sure the lack of pain to our sweet girl.

So the moral of the story is probably several parts: do lots and lots and lots of research, be sure to seek them out. But be careful of those who claim to know what they are doing but really don’t. They might know enough for certain families and have their place, but if you have a tough situation (which really should never have been tough), seek out those who are really great.",,False,self,False,t3_17vz6f

THANKS!!!

Thanks for all the feedback

As many have said, one of the adult rescue dogs I train got his CGC as well, and that helped boost my spirits. When he came to me, he didn't even know how to walk on a leash. His parents were also some of the great clients, so that was a win overall. A happy day. 

My attitude did suck. This is not a representation of my entire attitude, except people on the internet are aware of. I am patient with my clients, and actually did not get into training to train dogs, but got into it for the teaching experience. Enjoying training dogs was something that developed out of wanting to improve my public speaking and education skills. 

While I do agree there is no one way to train a dog, you will know, like I do, that most of the cases where a dog is ""disobedient"" is due to stress or a poor reinforcement history or raising criteria too fast. I would NEVER EVER punish anything- human or otherwise- when there was a chance that their behavior was due to a lack of understanding or proper teaching. And I will say that people who do punish in these situations should not be teachers, or trainers, or in charge of any being who is subject to their authority. ",,self,,

I firmly believe that at least 90% of these cases are dogs who absolutely *can* be crate trained
  
This weekend I am petsitting/training a couple of small dogs.  When their owners dropped them off they said they cannot be crated because they are too afraid of crates and they need to just be gated into a room at night.  I was also informed that one of the dogs is not potty trained at all and the other dog is a small puppy who they have just been taking out at times - she will pee outside but she will also pee inside and this is because they ""cannot be crate trained"".  
Last night I kept them both in the kitchen with a doggie bed on one end of the floor and a large canvas crate on the other end (this canvas crate is the correct size for my corgi and these two dogs are chihuahua sized).  As the night went they were reasonably crying and barking as it's their first night away from home
Pair with this that all night long they were having accidents in the kitchen and this morning only one peed outside - the other peed immediately on coming back inside.  I shut them into the crate.  There was some scratching and there's still a little light crying every minute or two

So I guess the moral here is that often when we think a dog is too afraid of a crate maybe we just aren't using the right kind of crate (wire instead of canvas


TL;DR was told dogs couldn't ever be crate trained because they are too afraid and that they aren't potty trained because of it.  After about 15 hours both dogs are crated with minimal crying and aren't soiling the crate. ",self,t5_2r067,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1j3e9g/psa_on_crate_training/
1367880755.0,1dtnof,Notes from an ER vet tech-making it easier to come to the vet and what to do when you're there.,xrareformx,52,4,40,"Hey friends! Thought I would share some insight with you from things my career has taught me. I am an ER veterinary technician

I've been working overnight ER for a few years now and I'll be covering emergency situations first. Here are some things that will make it easier for everyone involved with an ER vet visit:

          1. Don't anticipate and don't feed into your dog's fear.
-Most dogs are frightened upon arrival. In this situation, if I need to take that animal to the back for immediate care, don't ask to come back with the animal, I won't let you. Remember this is an ER and we have a lot going on back there that I may not want you to see or be around. Honestly, with most overprotective owners, I will just take the dog away from them and take that animal to the back where they can't feed off their anticipation and protectiveness. This enforces the dog to be fearful of us and we are there to help! Make it a positive thing. I know most emergency situations are stressful, but KEEP YOUR COOL. I see so many frantic owners and this creates frantic dogs. Staying calm will help us, immensely.

              2. If your dog is not okay with strangers
-When I take you and your dog into a room to get their vitals, he loves people. He's fine with everything!"" and I choose to take him to the back to get vitals. Many times you are telling me one thing, but your dog is telling me another. I have been snapped at many times, and I know the body language that comes before this. I know a few people that muzzle their animal before walking through our door, and that's not a bad thing. Please be aware of your dog's state of mind and as mentioned above, don't feed into it.

            3. Know what to expect-tests and estimates
-No, as we just won't end up being paid. Your vet will most likely make an estimate before starting treatment so you know what you're getting into. This includes tests we may need to run to try and figure out what's going on with your animal. We are there to help and good clinics aren't going to waste their materials and your time/money on tests we don't think are necessary. 

          4. WHAT TO DO IN A TRUE EMERGENCY
-If you bring your dog in, the 4% we have gotten back had to be on life support and will most likely crash again, and I have seen only one walk out of the hospital after getting her back, and she will never be the same due to the lack of blood flow to the brain at the time of CPR. HAVE A PLAN AND KEEP CALM. We will need to ask questions to try and figure out what led up to this point. Also-CPR costs about $500-1000 in time and materials to perform and your animal will most likely need to be hospitalized after and have a couple thousand dollars worth of care before you can even think of taking them home. Is this something you're prepared to do? Do you have a backup fund for something like this? We can't do any sort of treatment until we know what you're financially capable of. Tell us right off the bat how much you have at that time to put into it so that we can work around this and do the best we can with that. 


Most of the time we will be feeding your dog peanut butter and distracting them in the back during a treatment. I try and make it a positive experience for them. We use treats and positive reinforcement to get things done most of the time, and if you have any questions on anything-ASK ME! I'm here to help and NEVER be hesitant to call your local veterinarian for advise, although if we think your dog needs to be seen, we will just tell you to bring them in. We cannot diagnose over the phone and it's always better safe than sorry!

* Set your dog up for success: Start out next to a wall so your dog can't turn. 

* If your dog doesn't move backwards with you

* If the dogs rear end turns away from the wall

**""My dog already knows this trick

If you feel like this

* heel backwards on both sides

* do neat looking turns while heeling backwards?  

* heel backwards over an obstacle?

My dog has developed an aggressive leash reactivity toward most dogs and will growl and lunge when meeting most strange dogs for the first time. If they get too close to her, just a lot of noise. But its scary for everyone involved because she is a very big dog, over 100lbs.

She is only a 1.5yo puppy and I want to correct this behavior before it gets any worse. So I hired a local private trainer for 4 sessions. 

I thought she was weird at first when during our first consultation, which I was fine with. But on the second session, we started on the dog reactivity. She had two of her dogs closed off in an adjacent yard fenced off with chainlink, and she had me walk up toward the dogs with my dog. I would turn away whenever my dog would grow agitated or growl, which was often.

Then she had me go right up to the fence and have her sit. My dog reacted as she normally does, grabbed my dog by her muzzle, smacked her roughly on the face and chased her off while telling her ""NO! BAD DOG! WE DO NOT DO THAT!"" and then turns to me and tells me I need to nip that behavior in the bud because it is unacceptable.

Walks are difficult since we have a lot of dogs in the neighborhood and he would constantly bark loudly and lunge at them. To help Gambit out, and signed up for obedience class, and took a private lesson with a trainer. 

I knew I had to treat him every time he saw another dog, and my husband would often forget to bring treats when he takes him out in the evening, but after we made sure to do it consistently, we started seeing results.

The biggest triumph was this morning, and the rest of our morning walk went by great without any hitches! We ran into at least one other dog while walking and he didn't react to that one either.

In late 2009, the kind you only see once in a lifetime. He knew pretty much every trick in the book, stayed inside the yard without any attendance (Or a fence!), would rather pop than potty indoors, and was just, overall, the smartest and most loyal friend you could ask for. I say this because after he passed, who had already trained him as a pup)

http://imgur.com/juk7w Here she is! Isn't she cute? I'm not sure what breed she is (Neither did the humane society)

So first, without a doubt, the flightiest dog I have ever seen. She is afraid of absolutely everyone and everything, from cats to people, but she is *especially* afraid of males. Males like me. I am not sure of who had her before she came into the possession of the shelter, but I am pretty sure she was abused; She reacts to me, whether I am telling her she's a ""Good doggie!"" or offering her a treat, ever. I don't believe in pain-based encouragement), given that I am the only one in the house who is bothering to even try training her. I would really love to be able to get close to my dog

* Sitting/laying on the floor in the same room with her. She will run away or

* Treats. Zoey likes treats. Mmm

* Walks. Zoey loves walks. She will actually come to me if I give a cry of ""Walkies!"". Unfortunately

Almost done! You're a marathon runner of a reader. I again apologize for the wall of text. I don't know how to shut up sometimes

Second, so I am left with positive encouragement. And this is where the second problem begins.

Zoey -will not- go to the bathroom outside, or even walk on grass. Yes, if you can believe it, she is actually convinced she will be smacked if she walks on the grass, and I have to encourage (Read as: Push) her onto it to convince her it's okay, much to her immense joy (Did you know grass is filled with smells? Because hot damn, is grass filled with smells

I have convinced her to pee outside only once, and did what I can only describe as looking at me for permission. After reassuring her that ""Yes, Zoey! Such a good dog! Yeeeees!"", she went, wincing her face away as she did so, as if I was going to hit her any second. I didn't though, and only hugged and smooched on her approvingly, Reddit? Any advice?

So, and I feel that I am WAY over my head with Zoe. It doesn't help that I have never had a dog before, but I am not going to give up. Zoey is my dog, and I love her to death. I know somewhere there's a great dog waiting to get out (She is forever sneaking licks at my legs when I'm not looking), and I could really use some good advice from someone that knows what they're doing.

In my last post, attempting to lunge at our cats. I am very happy to say that we have since seen VAST improvement, after enlisting the help of a local behaviorist and positive trainer. Here's some deets:

1.) According to the behaviorist, and accept high-value treats in their presence. In her evaluation, she stated that Frank (having never seen or been with cats before) is attempting to greet them in the same way he might a dog--approach and heavy sniffing. The cats (obviously) don't like that, and they run away. That quick motion sends our excited pooch over the edge, creating a lunge. He just has no clue how to handle his excitement. 

2.) We've implemented a system of keeping everyone safe while the family re-adjusts. First, and kitchen. This allows up to ensure Frank is tethered to a secure point (in his harness), on a short enough lead that if he DOES lunge for the cats, he doesn't get far enough to feel like the lunging ""got him somewhere"" in getting to the cats. Over the past few days, he has just sat quietly, observing, since he recognizes the lunging doesn't get him any closer. 

These tether points aren't an excuse for us to just peace out, and for remaining calm and relaxed when they are in the room. This early on, it is hit or miss. The trainer addressed the following system-- Distance, Intensity, Duration. Right now, Frank is able to calmly handle a cat at a distance of about 15 feet, that is staring at him or playing with low energy, this is an improvement over the initial scene of 25+ feet to not even seeing

Thus, since cats are completely unpredictable. But the reinforcement is going a long way in giving Frank the tools he needs to handle surprise kitty visits in an appropriate manner. 

We also have times during the day where the cats are locked away

3.) We take it one day at a time, and the cats feel comfortable enough to come and sit in the room when the dogs are tethered. 


It's a nice feeling to have stuck by our rescue. Many of you advised that Frank would kill our cats, there is something to be said for quality, conscientious, careful and concerned pet owners. We are willing to put in the time, energy, and dedication to helping Frank be a part of our home. I am happy he will stay!

I've always lived with dogs at my parents' home

We're a stable couple in our thirties; we've been discussing getting a dog for more than 2 years and have spent a lot of time comparing different breeds, etc. I've re-read every book I have about dog-training and spent more time with my parents' dogs training and playing, both to get back into the habit, and to prepare them for our puppy since they'll basically be her 'uncles' and will spend quite some time with her.

We read up about dog psychology
had a long interview with the breeder and bought a whole lot of stuff the puppy will need. We've looked up vets

**... and I started reading r/dogtraining

... and that's where I got scared...

Much of what I read is already familiar to me, things that make perfect sense *and* things that go against my feeling/experience.

To give an example; with my parents' dogs, on the other, I just can't believe it actually works and am afraid that if I'm not behind it 100%, it'll influence the effectiveness of the approach.

It gets worse if you start to google things; the internet is full of articles telling you how to alpha train your dog and giving really awful advice in general. Sometimes, it seems a very reliable source, yet here on the Belgian TV, they're still happily re-running Cesar Millan every afternoon...)

Through all of this, yet respectful of the dog (no punishments or hurting the dog, always trying to look at things from his perspective and basing training on that), but on the other hand, there's so much more to be discovered, and I'm clearly a bit out of touch with the newest insights.


The problem is this: should I forget everything I know and start from scratch

So I was thinking: would it be possible to put together a short

I'm hoping you guys have some suggestions to add to that list. Many thanks in advance!

I know that for many breeds, and great with all the people working there, and he's getting better meeting people out in the world- when he approaches a new person, he can't wait to meet them, but after about 10 seconds of them petting him, you can start to see him get nervous and not want to be in the situation, especially when someone is looming over him.

But when we're at home, he bit (thankfully a warning bite, but our friend still said it was a 4 out of 10 on the pain scale) one of our friend's hands just because he was approached him and began scratching his butt. He's also snapped at another friend a while ago for leaning over him to pet him when he was sitting down. 

If our dog approaches someone, and he is definitely not okay with being approached uninvited. I know not all dogs love to be pet, but at this point, we can't even have him around people at our house without telling them ""don't get your face near his, don't look in his eyes, and don't approach him, let him approach you"".

Add in that he has resource guarding issues, to the point that he snaps at the vet just for approaching him, and now requires a muzzle to give him shots, and we are at our wit's end, and my girlfriend has been crying since last night.

We have put SOO much work into this dog. Since we adopted him at 8 weeks (he was the calmest one of the litter, including constant positive reinforcement of body handling, but he still barely loves to be touched. We are first time dog owners, so we've definitely made mistakes, but I feel like all we do these days is try to train our dog- 75% of what we talk about every day is dog training and it's getting exhausting. I knew going in that having a dog was going to be a lot of work- a lot, and I was prepared for that. But I didn't think it was going to occupy almost every minute of every day.

Right now, but I can tell the barking either excites her or upsets her. (And honestly, it upsets me too. These dogs sound like they are going to break through their fences and attack us.)

I also have a Siamese, and I've never seen him angry about anything in his life.  He also has zero self preservation instinct, and has to be involved in EVERYTHING.   I also have 2 other cats that act like cats.

So, which I suspect is because she was a stray and she's very skinny.  Feeding her on a regular basis has been very helpful, and i can take anything out of her mouth.  She occasionally will growl if she's eating and Hammy comes around, but I immediately remove the food to teach her that this is why she can't have nice things, and she's doing much better.

My concern is that I'm worried that she thinks the cats are squeak toys.  She gets excited when they run around the house, and all it would take is one bite from her and a shake and she could easily kill one of them.  She stays on a leash attached to me during the day, and I watch her like a hawk.  I've also got her to look at me when she sees the cats, and she's getting the idea that I don't even want her paying attention to them.  So she'll deliberately look away, but I can tell that she's still hopeful.  How can I teach her how to play with the cats while keeping them safe and not putting them in danger of a quick bite.  Hammy just runs right up to her and bounces off her back and he would bathe my former dog.  He has zero fear of her and was meowing excitedly as soon as he saw her.  I'm sure he'd love to play too, but I don't know how to keep everyone safe.",,self,,

Ok

I talked to my roommate about it this morning

We've agreed that, hear, and smell what's happening in the house, but my cat's won't be punished for his bad behavior anymore. When people get home, we can remove the baby gate and pick up the cat food so he doesn't get into it (they'll have had ample time to get their fill during the day). 

She has had to keep her bedroom door closed because one of my cats marks her bed (I think because he doesn't like the dog?). With the baby gate, so she won't have to worry about him peeing on her bed. 

As moving him out of spots on the couch has resulted in biting, I don't feel comfortable trying. Instead, if he jumps on a couch I will give a ""Get Down"" command, and gently push him with a pillow until he gets down. Once he's back on the floor, I can give him lots of praise. It seems to be effective so far. I don't get bit. He doesn't get frightened. And he's smart, so he's catching on quickly.

I explained to her that there are a lot of foods that are very toxic to dogs that are everyday snacks for people, and no one wants that. So no more table scraps. As he learns to leave table food alone, it will reduce stress for me, as I won't have to constantly worry about leaving a snack on the table that makes him sick. 

I've also been looking up different games that are constructive ways to utilize a dog breed's skill set so he has an outlet for his energy. We found some herding games to play with him as well as a few ""smart"" dog games to make him use his brain. 

She seems really excited to get started. I think she really wanted him to be more obedient and just didn't know where to start. I'm glad everything worked out and I was wigging for nothing. 

Oh! And my mother and I have a relatively strained relationship. She *loves* dogs and is amazing with them. She's super knowledgeable

I rescued a [puppy](http://imgur.com/a/iNnwY#0) who was constantly locked in a crate or dark closet for nights without being introduced properly.  He spent the nights (and as I was staying at the hostel I witnessed his cries) SCREAMING in full anxiety.  The solution by the family who found the dog was that if they would yell at him

This dog's constant practice of anxiety made him fearful of everything i the world and from 8-10 weeks spent much time hiding (by this time I had rescued him) under anything resembling safety and shelter

I took him on puppy walks every single day and began to teach him his place, and fetch but eventually I knew I would have to deal with the separation anxiety.  I was out of money, no work, and when a job opportunity came I had to make the decision to turn it down because I couldn't ""force"" my puppy into the crate situation and separation situation without properly rehabilitating him, on my own (no money for trainers).

I scoured Reddit and dog blogs and came to the conclusion that it was just all about taking it VERY VERY VERY VERY slowly.  Allowing him only to be in for tiny incrementally longer times and make it very rewarding to be inside it.  He learned to love the crate but the real test was trying to leave.  

Finally I had to leave to go shopping

It tore me up, and now it seemed I would have to give this pup up if I'm going to move on and get working.

Well I made the decision to tough it out

Over the next few weeks and the next few recordings my work began to pay off.  A few times back I left for 3 hours and his SCREAM had been replaced by very mild whines that wouldn't even wake a baby.  A week ago I left him for a day trip to the museum

Now tonight was the real treat and achievement unlocked... I left him in the cage for 4.5 hours again and the recorder shows NOT A SINGLE PEEP!

1369927184.0,1fc9ha,Dog using my baby's playpen as a fun obstacle for her toys,elevader,27,1,9,"Hi

She'll take her toy and push it under the pen and then lay on her side and bat at it and try and get it out. The playpen (which often has baby in it) gets bumped and pushed and jiggled and I can't seem to get her to stop doing it. The other problem we have is when Lolli gets super excited (when my boyfriend comes home for instance) she'll wag her tail and circle him and bash into the playpen

I can't seem to get her to stop and so now I've turned to Reddit. Anyone have any tips/tricks?

1367604276.0,1dmrld,My Corgi Will Not Stop Staring at Me.,BobaLobes,26,1,21,"I have a Welsh Pembroke Corgi.

She's a doll! We had her in basic obedience class and she graduated with flying colors! We've come across some annoyances. When we take her outside to the bathroom she stares at us. She'll lock eye contact for +5 mins. We do not play with her in the fenced in back yard. I keep that space dedicated for her going to the bathroom so there's not a chance she would get distracted from going potty. Even when we go into the house I'll spy on her from a window and she'll be staring from where I originally left her.

When I call her to me in the house she'll stay 20 FT away and stare at me. It's like a deer in the headlights look and she will not budge from eye contact or movement.

When I was trying to teach her to go in her crate she wouldn't even walk towards the crate to begin with even if I offer her her favorite treats. She just stares at me.

When I ask her to load into the car she tries to slowly inch further from the vehicle  and then cowers when we go to pick her up and let her in.

This is the most infuriating things. Any tips?


I'm thinking of keeping a leash on her for a couple of months and having her drag it around the house and tug it a little when I want her to come when called. 

She knows sit, touch, wait and all that.. She just does this sometimes.. I don't know why.

1367449615.0,1diife,Dog *screams* like a maniac whenever I come home...I'm out of ideas!,whirlingderv,28,1,15,"I got this 40lb pit bull beagle mix 5 months ago as a rescue from an animal hoarding situation. He turns two a month from now. He was born at the hoarder's, one day he managed to unbolt one of the locks and dragged the crate across the room trying to squeeze out. That was the last time I locked him up, which is fine

The problem is, bank off the back of the couch, etc. I work evenings at a restaurant, so sometimes I don't get home until after midnight, and I know my neighbor leaves for work at 6am, so I have to come up with a solution to get him to at least be quiet when I come home!

Things I've tried:

* Ignoring him when I walk in the door

* Giving him a job to do: asking him to go lay in his crate as soon as I walk in the door until he is calm, so basically, I can't get him to do this task before the screaming starts, so it is pretty much moot.

* Desensitizing him to my coming home. I've left and returned at varying intervals, then come back, and his spaz-out is still at about 80% of his normal intensity, like I've been gone for hours.

* It has gotten to the point where i feel like my only option is to give in and just pet him, my neighbor hasn't complained yet, but if she does, I'm not sure what I'll do. Plus I'm a real asshole if I let him continue to disturb everyone and nurture this undesirable behavior

I practice positive-reinforcement training, so I avoid it because he freaks out and cowers like I'm going to beat the crap out of him if I even raise my voice. I did positive training from the start, but still used corrections pretty regularly until about two months ago when I cut those down to just a few times a week when he is really crazy and just needs a sharp ""no"" to get his attention, and our relationship has really, really, strengthened since then. His recall is way, way better

Does anyone have any ideas of what I can do? Or experience with this kind of spazzing out? I think that, but I don't know how much more screaming he can do while I work with him, before my neighbor has had enough. I plan on talking to her next time I bump into her, apologizing and explaining that I am earnestly working on it, not just pretending everything is fine... I'm hoping someone has a better short-term solution... (Sorry for the wall of text, just trying to pre-emptively answer any questions/clarify the situation)",,self,,

Next is the scruff/collar. Sometimes at dog parks he will start playing a bit rough with a puppy, but the force of his teeth hitting my arm bones hurt and I don't want him to one day turn around and actually bite me. I really don't know how to break this habit. I have been told to bop him on the nose, but I really don't want to break his trust and make him worse off since he seems to be pretty sensitive already.

The girl-Marlowe-She is pretty laid back as well

1358396503.0,16qeah,"We are so,so sad and looking for advice about the next step with our aggressive 9-month old puppy.",sacheltry,28,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/16qeah/we_are_soso_sad_and_looking_for_advice_about_the/

We have a 9-month-old black lab-mix. We got her when she was about 4 months old. Her mom was a rescue and the day after the mom was rescued

Before we got her, Ian Dunbar videos, etc.

When we selected our puppy

We did crate training, we noticed that she had an aggressive streak. We first chalked it up to her puppy-ness but it was hard to get under control. There was resource guarding that was expanding, first it was an object, then larger objects, then it seemed to be the entire room. Also, during play, it would sometimes turn aggressive and scary.

We talked to our trainer and he had suggestions that we implemented. Frankly, but it she still seemed to be getting scarier and more unpredictable.

Finally, which she picked up within a few tries. What impressed me, but I don’t imagine it is a big deal to those reading this, was that she was able to sit on an apple box (20 x 12 x 8) with the trainer showing her just a few times — he was impressed. Only at the end of the hour-and-half session did she bare some teeth to him when he put her in her crate. He stood up, looked at her, and she backed down.

We kept a diary the week and sent it to the trainer. But then I was able to get two short videos of her playing with my son (about 9 years old). In the first one, the baring teeth was warning) she jumps up at him and grabs his arm, but she didn’t bite down. In the second video, again with my son, he is doing some training with her and having her jump over small hurdles. After the last one, she jumps up and starts biting him. That it happened to be my son is actually sort of irrelevant, as she seems to do this with anyone in the family.

Some of you might think that we have been abusive or using negative techniques or just don’t know better. Well I can say it is certainly possible that I don’t know better but we have certainly tried to know as much as we can. I don’t know many 9-year olds who talk about how important bite inhibition is

After seeing the videos

Tonight has been a terrible night of crying for my family. I thought I got it out of my system in the car before I got home, emotion, money (don’t care too much about that at this point) and ourselves that we don’t want to let her go. But within minutes of this discussion she was baring teeth at me for walking by her, when she didn’t have anything near her. It is pretty clear to my wife and me and even the kids (who know it but can’t say it) that she needs to be placed where we and she will all be safe and happy.

So here’s my question: what do you think is the best way to deal with this

Do we get another dog? (My wife has already said she wants another one.) How long do we wait? Should we get another puppy or an adult?

I need still to talk to the new trainer (and some others)

Or this: Do we keep her and keep trying other techniques?

Thank you for reading. I feel like I’ve already lost her and any insight and advice will be so very much appreciated.

EDIT: Thank you all for the supportive
We have had her checked by two different vets and both say she is healthy and there are no signs of something going on. However

The new trainer (certified

The hurdle thing with my son was just us playing. She would just leap over the hurdles or go under them. She seemed to really enjoy it. We didn't pull her over the hurdles. He would just say 'Over' and point and she went. The problems has been that almost all the playtimes with her usually turns aggressive. My son (or any of us) never pulled, until her biting was too painful for me.

Just got in touch with the rescue foundation we got her from. I am going to talk to them and with their trainer and see what they suggest.  

As much as we want to be and are a dog family

UPDATE: I spoke with the rescue people and she was great. They said they would take her back and do their best to find her a good environment. That we shouldn't worry about her being euthenized or harmed in anyway. She also said that given what I've told her of some of the techniques we were taught by one trainer

I want to properly socialize my 1 year old pit/lab, she will continuously bark in their faces. I wish we could have worked on this in her obedience class, but they understandably kept the dogs separated and we weren't even allowed to let the dogs greet each other. 

My husband and I have tried several socialization sessions one-on-one with our friends who have dogs, and straining at her leash (we've done our best to train her to loose-leash walk and stand).  She gets so excited to the point where food, her primary motivator, is completely ineffective, and she won't listen to any commands. 

How can we start to teach her to be calmer around other dogs? The best I've managed so far is getting her to sit and ignore other dogs when they walk by on the street (ok,,False,self,t5_2r067,1357609615.0,,True

She is a border collie/basset hound that I rescued from a nearby shelter and she is currently 7 months.  

When I first got her, she could not leave my sight because she would be chewing on things and wreaking havoc.  But she is a puppy and I understood that she didn't know any better.  That's when I turned to reddit and asked for help and tips and someone kindly suggest clicker training.  So i've been watching https://www.youtube.com/user/kikopup videos and they have helped so much.  

Now Penny is an angel.  With clicker training

Sit:  She easily sits on command and she also knows that she has to sit when she meets new people and not jump up on them

Down:  She actually learned down very quickly.  She knows that if someone is in the kitchen and if she wants to be in there

Leave It:  I taught leave it so that she would stop walking away with my shoes and to teach her what she can and cannot chew on.  Now, and to follow me.  She keeps eye contact the entire time. 

Spin:  I taught her spin about 4 days ago and she picked up on it quick.  I simply flick my wrist tell her to spin

High Five:  We began working on this today and with just one session after she picked up the concept


So all in all

New to the subject of reactivity? A reactive dog is one who displays *inappropriate responses* (most commonly barking and lunging) to dogs, where the dog is only reactive while on a leash. Some dogs are more fearful or anxious and display reactive behavior in new circumstances or with unfamiliar people or dogs whether on or off leash.

I adopted a shy dog who's making some great improvements. He's gotten to the point where he won't run away or growl at strangers anymore, this medium-sized off-leash dog comes CHARGING at us at full speed barking, and my dog's freaking out, pulling every which way on the leash, and it was really difficult for me to get him away. My boyfriend, who was a little further down checking the mail, caught up with us and stepped in front of the charging dog right before the dog got to mine

Doesn't end there. THEN! The other owner insisted the dogs were just trying to be friends. Here, there was no wound or blood or anything except for the other dog finally stopped trying to get at my dog. The owner just laughed and told ME not to worry, he won't blame my dog like it was entirely my fault. I was so angry but had to get my growling pulling dog out of that situation and as far away from them as possible.

I haven't encountered another stranger or dog yet in the walks after this

Now that I'm a little calmer [sort of], so it was difficult in the short amount of time I had. Any advice or tips for next time?

There was a smaller younger dog, but her owner assured us all that she was just playing and wasn't hurting anyone because 'no one was screaming'.

Everyone else thought that was cool

My dog likes to fetch, but me and the other owner were there and it never escalated, they were able to play fetch together without any problems really. But it was perhaps not a good first impression for the other people.

Back to little dog, they were sharing just fine till little dog got growly and I'm pretty sure nippy. So they had a small tussle which I broke up. (In retrospect I should have left at this point.) 

So my dog has a Frisbee-ish toy, hair is down, he's pretty passively allowing her to tug. Then *She* gets growling, (her owner starts to get worried about my dog who is doing nothing. She walks toward the dogs but doesn't do anything to remove her dog from the situation) *she* stars baring her teeth, I stand up to get closer to the situation, and suggest to her owner that *her* dog is the one growling. My dog drops the toy. He is lying down at this point, still with no hair raised. little dog moves toward him, she pauses. Then she goes at him and they fight.

I break it up and sit with my dog by the tree. He seems calm despite the incursion. Then someone mentions that we should go and my dog is 'pushing all our buttons'

I was honestly Surprised

Is it because of my dog breed or size or appearance?

I'm not sure that I can/should train my dog to just *ignore* another dogs aggression.

I *do* need to teach him to share the toys better

Maybe I should not bring him to the dogpark

Or maybe I should just leave if I see another dog that could be problematic or an owner who is uncomfortable. (This is what retrospect is telling me I should have done)

Or maybe it is me and a fault in my training with him. I do not want to blame the other dog entirely

I thought I would share my experiences of training my puppy

I have a five month old whippet puppy ([Oblig pic](http://imgur.com/oqTxl42)) who

When we got him, so we've made mistakes naturally, but overall I'm very pleased with how he's turned out. 

The biggest problem we've had with him is disciplining him when he's being naughty , trying to get in the kitchen drawers for his treats. We were having a real problem at one point when he kept peeing on the floor. Back then (wow was it only a few weeks ago?!) we were pretty much constantly saying ""No!"" To him, almost every few seconds, trying to teach him not to do things.

One day

We finally found a way to discipline him without making it a negative thing. When he puts his paws on the table, the same way as we would if we were asking him to sit or come. We correct him, praise him and carry on with our day.

He still tries reaching up onto the table, but on disciplining him, we've turned it into a positive thing which leaves us feeling a lot better about the whole thing!

I hope this anecdote will be useful to other owners with sensitive dogs :)

In 2 weeks this fluffy [ball of fur](http://www.helpinganimalsromania.de/hunde/r%C3%BCden/quento/) is hopefully going to be arriving at our apartment (!).  They found him in the parking lot of a supermarket in Romania with a terrible bite-wound, living alone.

This arrival is all very recent and he's suffering terribly in the conditions they're keeping him in down in Romania, but this might be due to his character.

Apparently, but I must admit I'm a little worried about training him because he's not overly responsive to stimuli.  My best guess at the moment is that, as a former stray, high-value food will be a great reward for him, so hopefully that's the case. 

I suppose in America it may not be not overly common for ""real"" strays to be found very often, can be notoriously stubborn and independent, which is fine, but I'd love to turn this li'l fella into a real heart-throb with a ""forever home"" in the near-ish future.

However, I've never seen him kill anything or even look aggressive (except once).

And this is from a dog that is literally the most docile I've ever had.  I come from an area that has lots of stray hunting dogs.  So

I fenced in our 1.5 acre property so that he can't go chasing pigs or kill our neighbors goat.  I've never seen him get out

I bring him into the duck/chicken fence (.5 acres) when I'm working in there or feeding them.  Initially I would have him on a leash and I'd wait for him to get excited.  It never happened.

I found his group in the bargain trader and drove out to see them. When I got there he was in a pen outside with a heap of other dogs. His hair was matted in feces and he was very sick in the corner to the point he could barely walk. The other dogs were stepping on him and acting aggressive towards him. When I first saw this place I couldn't stand it and didn't want any of the dogs since they all looked awful but I just felt so bad for him that I paid the woman 500 bucks to get him out of there. I took him to the vet and had to get him special food because he had starved to the point he could not eat dry kibble. They also told me the woman had given him so many drugs it had made him very sick. Eventually working with the vet and all my savings he got healthy. I've had him for 8 months now and he is a happy healthy dog. The problem is he HATES people and dogs.

When it's just me and him at home he is wonderful. He listens to everything I ask him to do and he is very loving and sweet. But whenever I try to have a friend come over he goes crazy and barks non stop and charges at them or trys to bite them. He runs around the house and takes all the socks/shoes and his toys and puts them on his food bowl. He will then sit on top of the food bowl and bark at my friend until they leave. Even if it's for hours

I've tried letting my friends feed him and pet him. I've had them over lots to try and get him used to the same people but he just doesn't let his guard down. Even after months of seeing them 2 or 3 times a week. Other than that I tell him No! and have tried putting him in time outs but he just sits in the cage and barks his head off/growls the entire time. Even if we cover the cage with a blanket. 

When he first started getting healthy I was taking him for walks regularly and he does the same thing at people walking by us or driving by. I finally got so embarrassed of telling people 'No no! please stay back' every time they wanted to socialize with me that I have discontinued walking the dog permanently. Everywhere I go he makes me feel so embarrassed and I feel like his behavior is a reflection of how terrible I am. My friends don't want to come over any more and if I ever go out they make sure to remind me not to bring the dog. I love him so much but I don't know what to do anymore. He makes me so upset and ashamed. Thank you. Sorry for my grammar/spelling I know it's terrible.

So, there's been no bloodshed and things have gone very well.  I'd like to thank those that gave some advice in that thread, we've integrated several of the tips with great success.  We prefixed their meeting by exchanging some smelly blankets a couple of weeks before hand, to familiarize each with the others scent.

We met in neutral territory, but she was very keen on sniffing/approaching him.  I walked him down the trail, and my GF followed with her dog wanting very much to sniff at mine.

After 10 minutes or so of this, and she immediately had to follow suit.  In the meantime, he had wandered off down the trail.  She seemed to feel compelled to follow.  She now pees wherever he does, it seems very important to her.

And that's pretty much it.  She was immediately happy to walk along side him.  He grumbled at her when she licked at his face and she immediately backed off, dancing around him barking, etc), but he didn't acknowledge her at all.  She eventually gave up and started exploring around.

It was a very informative weekend for learning about some of her triggers.  It's been very difficult to find people and space to work with her.  I have several friends here in town that own dogs that were keen to meet her

Her biggest trigger for aggression is people and dogs approaching directly in front of us.  Over the last few days, but not trigger the aggressive response.  After a short time of doing that, she's happy to walk right alongside relatively new people.  The odd treat from the newcomers doesn't seem to hurt either.  We feel like we've learned a lot about what it is that sets her off and it's giving us something more precise to work on.

My GF is away for a week and I'm looking after both dogs.  They're sharing the same space with no problems.  He's growled at her a few times if she's approached something that he appears to be ""claiming"" (bed space

While out walking, he returns to what he was doing.  She has responded with surprise and submission every time so far, and it's happening less and less (she's not trying to take his sticks any more).  This is pretty much the same pattern as he's established with other dogs that we spend time with.

Overall, walking calmly past situations that would often create what we call the ""shark on a rope"" situation.

Her recent history doesn't contain much other dog-on-dog socialization

In addition to this, and we're going through a rigorous 10-week obedience training course aimed at older dogs with behavioural problems.  It's only 1 week in, but she's picking up the training very quickly.

My GF was feeling trapped for quite a while

My other half and I adopted an 18 month old Lab/Beagle cross about a year ago from the rescue centre and he has been perfect in every way. We got a second dog from the rescue centre 2 weeks ago. He is a collie crossed with god knows what - I suspect German Shepard with some husky / malamute in there somewhere. He is perfect with the first dog - they play together, no fighting over food, no attempts to establish dominance.... just perfect. The new dog is also fantastic with us, very loving, in 2 weeks has learnt to sit, stay, to take food gently, to lay down

I live in a block of flats / appartments. Whenever the new dog is within the communal areas of these flats, just establish that ive seen the person, stand between him and the person and tell him no and he shuts up. He also does it when he is in the car (we drive him upto the woods every day for a long run) - I think he also views the car as his territory. He barks at everyone in his territory, but not too badly - women not much atall, but men, specially men in hoodies, he goes crazy at.

However, so he lunged and bit the guy on the arm. Thankfully he had a thick hoodie sweater on (probably why the dog picked fight over flight due to my theory about his past) but even through this sweater his skin was grazed - if he had a short sleeve on I am sure it would have broken the skin.

This is absolutely not acceptable. I know that I should have gone first, combined with some terrotorial dominance.... but either way, I cant have this happening. Thank god the guy in question is a nice guy and a friend and totally understands its a new dog which is somewhat unpredictable who has had a rough start who is trying to be put right - if it was someone less understanding then I dread to think of the consequences.

He was immidiatly disaplined - in the heat of the moment, but he certainly got the message and for the rest of the day he was very subdued. Being responcible, now we know there is a potential issue,  he now wears a muzzle when going through the communal areas and I have made some phone calls to some local dog behaviour experts as well as the rescue center to get some advice.

I really turn to you guys for some help and advice. I am a responcible owner, his natural instincts will always be to fight rather than run.... and Ive no idea how to program that out of him as how can you setup and stage such an incident?

I'm starting to get pretty concerned about my Lola's prey drive.  Walks are a constant scan for squirrels, fuzzy critters.  I literally have to pull her away from the scene if she actually sees one.  She'll plant herself firmly, such that when I lean in and pull her away, she'll rear up on her hind feet and be walked backwards.  It takes a good half-block before she'll stop trying to go back, and for the next 5 mins or so, she's in constant high-vigilance scan mode.

That alone is ... annoying.

But recently she's decided small dogs are also prey.  I tried a dog park a couple times - first time was spectacular.  Second, heck, her tail was wagging most of the time.  We separated them and left immediately after exchanging contact info and I picked up all the vet bills for the owners.  We've not gone back (nor will we, I think).

Since then, head and ears up, tail up) and if they get too close, she just goes to get them.  Today there was a close call when we had to pass right by each other (hiking in the woods) and the owner picked up the other dog.  Lola tried to jump on them and take the dog out of their arms.  Needless to say, this is quite upsetting to everyone (except Lola...), and since I took to kneeling down and hanging onto Lola's harness and collar to let smaller dogs pass.

I really don't like having to do that

I'm working constantly on attention and focus games

Muzzles are an option but I'm loath to have to go to that.  The assumption when people see a muzzle on a dog is that it's dangerous to everyone/everything.  She's generally a super sweat heart to people.  Gets along pretty well with dogs her size, I've told the dog walker about all the incidents) and gets along fine with the smaller dogs in there.  

**TL;DR**: Dog is very prey driven

Any thoughts?  I'll keep up with the focus games

We decided to start using the bells on the door.  For 2 months we rang them every single time we went out to go potty in conjunction with the potty command.  The first time she rang the bells was right *after* she peed by the door.  The next couple times were sporadic at best, she did it again 2 more times!  (Big rewards and loves were had).  Since then, she has had very few accidents!  

We are just now experimenting with giving her a wee bit more freedom...I got another set of bells and hang them over the side of the gate wherever we are sectioned off at.  She has been using them to let me know that it's time to go out.  We have also moved the gate so that she has access to the bells on the door and she has used them as well.  :)

I can't believe she is finally getting it and I am super excited that it won't be *too* long before she can be ""free"" in the house and not tethered to me the whole time or gated in or crated when I can't watch her.

What is not manageable is the fact that he escalates his whines into barking and yelping and howling in his (downstairs) crate whenever I am walking around upstairs in my bedroom or bathroom, etc., so he naps a lot), and I work from home so he gets plenty of attention and love. It is not separation anxiety since it doesn't begin the moment I leave, and even if I leave the house this often is not bark inducing. I know it has nothing to do with him needing to go outside since I can trigger it immediately after him going outside.

The problem as I see it is that he thinks barking or whining in this situation gets me to come downstairs (since it NEVER stops until I do...we are talking all night, since it did get us to come downstairs and let him outside when we were potty training him. Now that he is potty trained, we have let it go all night multiple times to teach him that he gets nothing out of it, but he just keeps going until we come downstairs in the morning. I reward him for quiet in his crate, and this has worked and is probably the reason he never barks when I am downstairs and able to reward. If someone is around downstairs, he will not bark, so I see no method of training this positively (i.e., since he is already quiet...its only when he is alone and hears someone upstairs).

I seriously cannot sneak to the bathroom in the middle of the night, just hear me come down the stairs). We are in a town home and the neighbors are getting pissed (since we share 3 walls with three separate neighbors).

I understand the risk of bark collars (and would only consider a vibration, but I could get fined by the HOA soon and my neighbors are at their wits end. However I see no way of positively training this situation. I am not open to the idea of letting him roam free in the house (I don't trust him yet to not destroy, pee or poop on things to get attention when he is out of my sight), nor moving his crate (it is well placed for a variety of reasons, including the fact that I can work near him most of the day at the current location).

Before that, but was rescued by a local when she came down from the mountains to beg for food for her puppies. 

It's been a long road domesticating her, but hasn't shown any aggression towards people - even when very afraid. I can easily reach in and take away a toy, bone, treat or food and she doesn't mind at all. She gives me no trouble taking food/food-like resources out of her mouth if she has grabbed something she shouldn't. 

That said - in the last few weeks, she'll give a quick growl, a tentative snap in my direction, and get up and walk away or resettle somewhere else. For example, if she's laying down on the floor and I reach down to pet her, or if she's laying on the couch next to me, and I shift a little bit. This doesn't happen every time - probably just a few times a week. This will even happen if she's wide awake and aware that I'm moving towards her.

So far I've tried ignoring it but that doesn't seem to be helping any. I feel like taking myself away from the scene won't accomplish anything either and might actually re-enforce the behavior.

1. **Charging Frequency** - Is it necessary to ""charge"" the clicker before each training session? I normally start each session by having Murphy give me eye contact, is this necessary every time or can we just jump into the training?

2. **Keeping Focus in Future Sessions** - Murphy is a pretty excitable dog, but it really isn't an ongoing behavior. Is this something that I should *really reinforce* separately by dedicating more sessions to focus? Or is it okay to keep doing what I've been doing? Normally i can get him to stop focusing on the treats and on me within a few attempts, but its frustrating that we have trained this a lot already and he loses focus immediately when we start a new learning activity. 

3. **Adding Distractions While Loose Leash Walking** - Murph has done phenomenal so far learning how to position himself during walks. He performs best in low distracting environments so i have started doing some training sessions in busier areas to compensate. However, when he is fixated on them and does not pull and stays close, I have normally been giving the positive interrupter noise, clicking and then treating... although he may ""drift"" a little bit towards them with his ears perked up and tail wagging. I fear that while training the walking aspect of loose leash walking, I am also encouraging excitability as he seems eager to go check them out (although not pulling). We have only had 2 or so sessions with added distractions though... is this something that i keep having to work at? And is this an OK use of the positive interrupter or should i try to keep his attention on the distractions?

Thanks!

Recently (just about two months ago) I got a (now) 4 month old rottweiler mix male puppy named Carson. Prior to getting my new puppy I had another male rottweiler who passed away in November

At first everything seemed to be going well

Recently however I have had two incidents with them that have left me quite concerned and I'm not sure how to proceed. Both times my older dog will walk past my puppy (who is lying down) and into another room, but I have seen Carson play with other dogs and trust me that this is not play. Jack is screaming and trying to get away when this happens and I have to physically pull Carson off of him. Carson outweighs Jack by about 25 pounds, and Jack doesn't have very many teeth left after many had to be extracted at the vet, so he can't really fight back with his teeth, and body language does not seem to be enough to tell Carson to stop. Both times I have had to pull Carson off because he is really hurting Jack and Jack can't get him off himself. 

Carson has been around lots of other dogs since we got him (while being mindful of the fact that he wasn't fully vaccinated)

Both attacks were incredibly sudden, I won't be strong enough to get him off of Jack if he does it again. It also is incredibly disconcerting for Jack who is clearly shaken up after both of these incidents and who now seems to be somewhat timid of Carson.

I really need help, but due to their body language and suddenness this is clearly not a play situation that got out of hand.

Any help or suggestions would be sincerely welcomed as I am really worried about what the future holds for this puppy. ",self,t5_2r067,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1ga4pl/desperately_need_help_with_puppy_attacking_older/

I'll give a couple of examples and I hope someone can help me figure out my dogs' behavior.  

**Example 1:**  One of my dogs does not like to be humped.  This morning she was repeatedly mounted by a fixed male GSD at the dog park and she responded in a way that I think is acceptable:  ears go back, she makes a short, clear bark-growl and flips around to escape his grasp, and at that point I call her to me and she happily comes over.  That way if he follows, I can help her out, or if he's slow to follow, she and I can do something else super fun like fetch or run around together.  
*Technically, or is she learning to interact positively in a world where sometimes owners let their dogs hump mine?*  

**Example 2:** My other dog looks stressed sometimes when she's initiating play.  She puts her ears back, I redirect her if the other dog hasn't engaged).  

This morning a dog responded very negatively to the earliest stage of this process (the prancing, they had butt-sniffed and proceeded to ignore each other before my dog approached for a second time.  The other owner was on the phone at the time (for maybe 30 seconds... I had actually been chatting with him just before) so he didn't see what happened, neither of us is really sure if they should be in the park at the same time anymore.  
*Was my dog being rude?  How can I read her body language better?  (Note: She doesn't have a tail, before I got her 6 years ago).*

He knows what commands are, he just doesn't care.  Lastly, he continues to ""mouth"" the adults.  It's not biting, but it is just as annoying.  
    
So I'm struggling here.  The lack of food-motivation makes things really difficult.  I don't want to use a toy or ball because he's not focused on learning -- he's focused on the ball.  He's not making the connection between behavioral corrections and rewards.

I'm just looking for experiences with dogs that have been on anti-anxiety medication.   

The long and short of it is that my two year old dog has gotten progressively worse since I adopted him at 4.5 months. He is absolutely fear aggressive and has a history of latching on to other dogs without warning. The word ""unpredictable"" is probably the best word to describe him. With my boyfriend and myself, he goes into tunnel vision with his aggression. (Lunging, barking, and trying to bite it.) I can hear how anxious he is in his whine. As a result, on walks are extremely difficult with him.  

When we first adopted him, this doesn't cause him to act out inside at all. I'm suspecting he may have problems with his thyroid because even as a puppy, he was very low-key and not as hyper as normal puppies.  
Our only saving grace to keeping him active was that I recently bought a house with a backyard. About a week ago
I have compeltely trained my older dog, and he will stay and take treats... but the second he sees a moment to make a break for the fence, he bolts with no warning and goes into psychotic-mode. It's almost as if he has absolutely zero impulse control. (Which is crazy, because he knows ""leave it"" really well and can stay for long periods of time.)  
I have some experience with training dogs. I know what I'm doing. BUT
So
If it doesn't work
I'm just looking for some sort of success stories and positive vibes... something because the last year and a half of owning him have been so difficult. He's such a sweet guy, I'm going to want to have kids and he is just too high risk to keep around with children unless something seriously changes.  
Oddly enough, he doesn't open his mouth when he's hanging out with us. Event he rare times he wags his tail (when my boyfriend and I come home) his mouth is closed. It's such a small thing, but it boggles my mind how he never just relaxes and opens his mouth to smile.

My wife and I adopted our first dog about three years ago.  He was/is a full-grown lab mix

We started working with a behaviorist that was recommended by our rescue organization.  He introduced us to a choke chain and used a combination of leash corrections and treat rewards with various people in the house....and our dog did improve A LOT.  A few months later, she also promoted the use of a choke chain and emphasized to us certain dominance-alpha dog principles such as not letting your dog on the furniture in the ""alpha"" position, etc.  

Cut to a few years later....he still has issues with certain people in the house....but generally warms up to them after a brief training session.  I've been trying to improve some bad habits we've let both him and his sister (who we adopted a year after we got him) have picked up and I've been reading a lot here and on other sites about how the whole alpha-dog thing is BS and so is all the correction-based training we've been doing all this time.  

I've started changing my approach....stopped using the choke collars...using a much more positive approach in general.  Is the general consensus that letting dogs on the furniture whenever they want (or perhaps just when they're invited up) also has no bearing on their general level of obedience....even for territorial dogs?  Are there any rules/restrictions that really would alter his perspective that it his his territory to defend?

I have two dogs

Long story short


Our hound, and he had been brought to the rescue at 1 year old and was clearly abused, he's skittish if you make sudden movements behind him, if men make sudden movements near him at all.  He has definitely improved and trusts us more now, he used to yelp if I walked away from him while my boyfriend had him on the leash, but he is now much more comfortable/trusting and doesn't mind that scenario.


I worked from home the entire time we've had him so far, but I did some training with baby gates and gradually building up our time leaving them alone and he is much better.


Daycare is expensive and I now have to go to the office daily.  We have a dog walker now who comes mid-day for 30 minutes, but seemed pretty okay once I was home.  However, I feel like the more days I leave, the more anxious he is that I won't come back.  He pees on things despite being taken out and not having a ton of water left, and he also barks at ANY sound in the hallway towards the end of the day.    So far we haven't gotten any complaints, but I feel like it's just a matter of time and I really can't afford daily daycare.


Basically... what more training can I do to help my dog relax a little?  Should I go back to the baby gate training?  I can't do it gradually as I -have- to go to work, our dog doesn't have a ""spot"" (like a crate or bed) to make him go to when there are hallway sounds, and he doesn't really bark at them unless we aren't home!


Any advice would be much appreciated.  I worry that my dog will eat things while we're gone (he has eaten collars, so I obsessively move -everything- out of sight when I leave, but I'm still afraid one day I'll forget a sock and he'll eat it out of panic.

Thanks!

Since she came off the street, but she sits and stays like a champ. She is very territorial, but once someone is introduced as a friend, she's fine with them and will rest her head on their leg.

Today she snapped at my cousin, who was just holding her hand out for her to sniff, while another cousin was petting her. If she knows both people, like if my husband and I pet her at the same time, it's a non-issue.

At this point she still gets really excited over every small animal we see. This of course isn't a problem (and is natural really) as she tends to just strain to the end of the leash and watch intensely. 

The problem is cats.

When she sees a cat she absolutely goes insane. I wouldn't mind her pulling after them

He isn't trustworthy off leash so we take multiple long leash walks every day

This problem has been happening for a couple months now. We'll be out on a long walk

It's kind of like he wants to play, yanking on the leash until he pulls me off balance (he's about 50lbs, I'm about 125). If I stop walking or try to distract him by getting him to sit (even if I have treats), he will square off, look at me and bark in my face. It's a very agitated bark and very different from how he acts when he wants me to play with him. 

For the life of me I can not figure this behavior out. The only way to deter him is to pick up a stick

I met a dog behaviorist who studied with Cesar Millan - I don't agree with a lot of his techniques

I'm concerned because it's getting worse. It used to happen once per walk; today he did it three times. And it's dangerous because we have to walk right next to the road - he could jump in front of a car or pull me in front of one. 

I'm really stumped because otherwise our dynamic is great. It's just me and him; I love him to pieces

Doggy psychologists and seasoned trainers - halp!



**UPDATE:** So, I let him wear his backpack and carry his own pickup bags (we both love this, but it means I can't use his harness and he's not great about loose leash with just the collar, so it only works with jogging). Then, instead of doing the exact same run, we turned around a little early and in an entirely different spot than he's used to. Then we did some zig-zags back and forth across the road, with lots of praise for keeping pace and focusing

And it worked! Not a single freakout today!

I crate trained her right from the beginning and I must admit it was was easier than expected. She likes her crate. She sleeps in it without whining. It is a few feet away from my bed and I plan to increase the distance beetween the crate and the bed very soon.

And I work from home, so the other day, I had to leave for about 4 hours, from 7 to 11pm. I didnt really want to crate her from 7 to 11 and then go to sleep and crate her again for another 6-7 hours, so I thought it was a good idea to give her a bit more freedom. So I pretty much emptied a spare bedroom for her. There was a bed in there, a small table with a book on it and thats it. I gave her few toys ans I stuffed Kong as well. I crossed my fingers and left the house.

So I come back about 4 hours later. The bedroom she's in is downstairs, and yes, nightmare. Shit everywhere on the bed, floor, walls, door. She scrached the bottom of the door to the point that we can see it from the other side of the door. Oh and she completely destroyed the book on the table, obviously. Anyway

I am not blaming it on her at all. I think my mistake is pretty obvious. 4 hours was a too long period for me to 'test her'. I should have try smaller steps first. But from here, at what age do dogs are usually fine with being left alone the in house?

This family used to have Labs for years but this is their first Weimaraner.  They understand the breed is high strung and very smart

She takes letters from dog owners and answers them with the best advice and training advice she can give. I urge you all to check out this book seeing that some of the problems that were published have had some similarities to recent posts here. 

Donaldson gives people basic exercises to use with dogs to help condition their problems so they can live happier lives. She also touches on the mental perspective of dogs where medication is the cheaper/more effective route to take because (much like people) dogs can develop a mental illness which meds can ease away their issues.

When we first brought Winston home from the shelter he had very little interest in our cat.  I was happy to see this.  Our cat has been with us for several years and is very important to us.  However since then he has changed quite a bit.  He no longer leaves the cat alone.  At first it was just playful batting with his paws.  Now it's full on pin and wrestle.  It's not really aggressive as he doesn't break skin.  I always stop it when it happens

I should tell you that I try to make sure he isn't inside to much during the day.  We do at least one walk (aprox. 1 mile) each day.

As to the suggestions of an escape route

I may be wrong but I still believe it is playing.  Also I should point out that sometimes the cat starts it.  I've seen numerous times where Winston is sleeping and our cat (Chinet) stocks Winston.  Chinet will sneak around a corner and jump on Winston and have a good play.  I really like when they do interact.  It's just recently that the playing has moved to a level I'm uncomfortable with.  I'm sure it's partly my fault as I probably should have stopped that behavior the first time it appeared.

His recall is great when off leash, I've curbed the food aggression. 
I'm at a loss on how to curb the herding behavior. 

We go on long walks every day and I take him places he can run off leash and chase toys and play with my friend's dogs. I'd just love some ideas on getting a herding dog not to try to herd the neighborhood kids. :/

Thanks for any ideas you may have.

This training method seems rather extreme to me

Edit: this trainer is very popular in our city, I'll reply to you and give more info in few hours.

 From your replies I'd say there's no need for a discussion, and said my sister can't do that since she's not strong enough, which is true but I doubt only 7ft tall males are able to train aggressive dogs.

Forget about him being responsive to any commands. He whines like no other whine I've heard come from him. Its pretty intense.

There are a number of problematic behaviors my dog has but I want to start with the most pressing one- thanks for any guidance you can offer

I've had my dog, she developed a separation anxiety problem when I leave and a somewhat smaller one when anybody at all leaves.  I have a somewhat obnoxious new neighbor who is complaining about it now and although there is no risk of eviction, I'd really just like to shut her up. I am afraid that one day at a future home it will lead to a real problem, though.

Essentially, in the few times that this has been done with a semi open door this closes it.  After this brief episode, she usually quiets down and goes back to sleeping or whatever she was doing before.  There are no additional destructive or disruptive behaviors.

I should also note that she does notice leaving behaviors

I've tried a number of things over the years, getting fully dressed with the keys and just sitting around or taking a nap, coming back in immediately afterwards etc.  Regardless of what is done, she waits until the door is closed and bolts to the door to make a ruckus.  Sometimes I'm able to tell her to go back to her crate through the door, mostly it doesn't work.  If someone else is leaving she does a bit of this too but if I am still home I'm able to tell her to go to her crate and she behaves herself since I am there.

The trick to this is that the problematic behavior only starts after I have closed the door and am unable to correct.  How can I train her to be chill as I am leaving?

Client: 80 something year old man and his adopted mixed breed dog (he doesn't know what it is, she is unable to attend the classes since they are at the store where I give lessons.  (In my opinion...they shouldn't have this dog, they aren't really equipped to take proper care of it.)

The dog is 2 years old

My problem is not so much with the dog as it is with the owner.  I've had difficult dogs before

In our first class together, I tried showing him some dog food that was comparable in price (even though it's lower quality dog food, at least it's dog food...).  He didn't want to hear it.  Today, in our third class I again tried explaining why he should switch him off of it.  Smiled and nodded at me, but he's still not going to switch him to dog food.  


Oh


He told me in the first class his end goal for the class was to have his dog sit when he is told and to have him respond to his name.  

These are usually things we cover and work on in the first two classes anyway

Noooooope.  His dog is not treat motivated at all.  I tried everything from several different kinds of soft treats, to lunch meat, to cheese, peanut butter, etc...nothing.  No interest. He is not toy motivated either.  

However, and they need LOTS of verbal praise every single time, almost more than you would think is necessary.

In the class, the ""sit"" command is completely forgotten.  This is either due to a lack of practice at home, or the fact that he's probably not praising him every time.  I've stressed each class how important it is that he praise him and make a big deal each time because it's the only way the dog will eventually make the connection between the command and the action.

One other think I've tried in the class to make it easier on him, and the dog on the mat.  That way the dog was at his level (since he's unable to get down to the floor to work with the dog at his level).  This is really the only way we've had any success with ""Sit"".

We've also been working on getting him to come when called.  Usually, and pet/praise/treat each time the dog responds.  Since the dog is nervous around me ( and pretty much everyone else for that matter), I'm unable to get him to come to me during the class.  He will go to his owner when called about half the time.  The other half, he runs around the room in circles directly in front of his owner.  I've also asked him to work on name recognition at home by calling him by name, and rewarding him with praise and pets whenever he looks.  

This is another thing that is clearly not being practiced.  Each week we are back to square 1.  

Finally

""Wouldn't you like to come?""  
""Oh no thanks

I told him it might be helpful if he came along to try some loose leash walking techniques for when he walks him...

""Oh no

Since the dog was already on the harness, he was walking nicely at my side around the store.  Went back into the room, and I explained a few of the techniques I used, and asked him if he would practice them that week.  ""Oh no, I'll just let you walk him around here to practice.""  

I tried to explain that it has to be consistent from person to person.  He's going to revert to his habits of (barely) pulling without his owner working with him.  But




I don't know what else to say to the man at this point.

He probably shouldn't have the dog.  I highly doubt the dog is getting enough exercise

I've had the conversation with people before about re homing their dog.  I'm usually not afraid to have that conversation when it's necessary.  With this guy though...I don't think it'll have any effect.  He just does not listen.  I have never felt like I wanted to drop a client before, that's not an option for me because I work in a retail pet store.  Even if I didn't, I don't think I'd actually go that route.

1375212654.0,1jdan3,I am confused about high value treat logistics.,sugarhoneybadger,20,4,32,"This is going to be a long one

I have been trying to work more clicker training into our lives, so the things I am trying to teach her (focus around other dogs, reliable recall) require really high value treats. The suggestions I have read all say things like ""use something your dog absolutely loves- not likes, LOVES."" I am having a really hard time finding treats that *stay* high value once I have introduced them, and I wonder if I'm doing something wrong. I also can't figure out how much I am supposed to be feeding, and whether or not I should be rewarding certain behaviors with food, how often

We usually train on our walks. For focusing on me better, they don't seem to have as much ""oomf"" when we encounter a distraction. After 2-3 days they become medium-value rewards, and finally have the same status as her normal treats.

I also can't figure out how often I should be clicking. I had a trainer tell me I was over-treating her and she was confused because she didn't know why she was being rewarded (in other words, I think she would rapidly lose interest in the treats. It also seems to make her really scatter-brained and she forgets basic things like not pulling on the leash and not darting all over the place when I give her a steady stream of treats. 

The other problem I am having is the sheer amount of food this seems to require, and that's *just* for walks! That's 10.5 pouches of Trainer's Choice treats at $5 each for a grand total of $52.50 per week. Nope. Not gonna happen. I do make my own treats sometimes and buy the Natural Balance logs, but things like round steak and chicken get expensive and NB is pretty low value for her. Is this trainer just insane or something? Here's another bonus problem: my dog is borderline low thyroid and has trouble keeping weight off. I can't actually feed her that many food rewards without jeopardizing her health. To top it all off, she is already uninterested in dog food in general, so I can't just use her kibble.  

I'm not trying to knock clicker training at all, how do I keep the high value treats as a GREAT reward without overfeeding? How do I reinforce ""foundation"" behaviors like walking politely and checking in without a ton of food rewards?

EDIT: Guys, and cut back her daily rations at meal times so that she gets most of it during training. Also, great ideas for cheap training treats! It sounds like these small tweaks should solve the problems I'm having with food rewards.

My girlfriend's dog, approximately 3 years old.  She's had him since he was about a month old, and has a generally sweet, kind demeanor.  He used to only get defensive if someone tried to take his chew toys.

My girlfriend lives at her parents' house right now.  Her mother runs a daycare for children ages 1-10 or so.  Blue is usually left on the side of the house

However, and probably facing tendon damage.  This in and of itself would merely be an unfortunate accident, but he seems to have become more aggressive since then. 

Three nights ago, bit and pierced her lip, and then bit her hand as well.  This unprovoked attack is what is scaring us.  GF's dad panicked and went to go get a gun, but mom talked him down.  

If it was just GF, there are too many risks and liabilities.

GF and mom don't want to euthanize Blue.  We all love him and can't bear the thought.  But we don't have the money for the necessary training

I have a 9 month old lab mix that I have had for about 7 months now.  I used to have really shitty walmart couches in my apartment so I didn't mind her jumping up on them.


My girlfriend just moved in and brought along her nice couches and we don't want her up on those.  Prior to the move I had been working on a ""get down"" command and she understands that but not that getting up on the couches is something we don't want her to do in the first place.


If we aren't paying attention she will set up shop on the couches and we have to command her to get down when we catch her.  When we do command her to get down she also gets riled up and sometimes springs back and forth between the couch and ground a few times.  I am worried she thinks that it is a fun game to play and not something we are trying to correct.


To that end


Do you folks have any recommendations for keeping the dog off the couches?  Probably noteworthy that she doesn't have an soft alternative (hardwood floors and she does not have a bed in her crate due to chewing issues).

So, it's probably some other type of aggression like barrier frustration or resource guarding. It also seems to be interpreted as a fear response, usually. My dog doesn't seem afraid of other dogs- if anything she wants to check them out and finds them attractive, but also anxiety-provoking in some scenarios.

Is it possible we're dealing with TWO different types of behavior here? From what I can tell

Low threshold + barrier frustration (leash) = reactivity (barking/lunging)

Low threshold + prey drive = predatory drift (trying to hurt small dogs but giving no warning)

1371889157.0,1guirx,At my wit's end...nothing I do or have tried is working.,Tailas,19,4,38,"My dog Loki has been a problem dog from the very beginning. He is four years old, so I do not know what to do.

First, but I feel like I am getting close, and I am afraid. He is afraid of EVERYTHING...loud noises, cars people, children, infants, other dogs, etc. I take him out all the time

He constantly steals food from the table, and I cannot get him to stop. He will get into the trash even if there is fresh food in his bowl. If I am looking at him, he will act like he's behaving, but as soon as my back is turned, he will misbehave at any opportunity. 

I walk him 3 times a day; in the morning before work, so I have no yard for him to do his business in, so I have to walk him. But he is so finicky when it comes to pooping; if anyone walks any where near him while he is about to go, he will stop and try to run. If the grass is wet for any reason, he will not go. I've walked him for up to hours at a time, and I know he has to go because he farts audibly when he has to poop, but if conditions are not perfect, but if he doesn't go outside

If he is in my apartment and he hears any noise, but nothing works.

The only place he seems comfortable is at my parent's house. I live only about 5 miles away from them, and he gets along well with them and likes being around them, but it took almost 2 years for him to get used to my family and my parent's dogs. To this day, he still barks at my younger brother, even though he has been around and spent time with him a lot of the 4 years I have had him. 

I've tried taking him to dog parks, always, even to dogs that are smaller or mellower than him. Even cats cause him to want to run away.

I've never had a dog that behaves like he does. I've never had this much trouble in my life. I love him with all my heart, but I literally do not know what to do any more. I'm on the verge of tears as I write this, because I love him and I want him to be my dog, but he's making want to tear my hair out in frustration.

Tips on teaching him the right way to play fetch!,dirtyredhead13,18,1,6,"So my 4 year old German Shepherd LOVES to chase any of his toys when I throw them for him.

I've tried using treats but he is not as interested in them when we are outside. 
When we play fetch inside he is better about giving up the toy but not necessarily bringing it back still. 

I'm wondering if I should only use 1 or 2 toys to actually play fetch with
Should I get better smelling/tasty dog treats rather then just a biscuit?
Should I include a long leash at first so he knows to bring it back ?
 What should I do outdoors if he does not bring it back? Ignoring him doesn't work too well because he just lays down with it and when I approach him again he just picks it up and starts running.

1367841158.0,1dscru,I'm afraid he might attack,Inestri,17,3,15,"Introduction:


A year ago I adopted a dutch shepherd
Before coming to the shelter he was abandoned in the woods

He has been a very good dog. We haven't had any problems with him. He is very loving

I completed beginner and advanced obedience school (positive reinforcement school) with him. He is very bright, so it's not easy to motivate him to work.

He is not very confident around new people, strange new objects etc.


Problem:

**There were 3 - 4 situations that looked like an attack without a bite and he also nipped 2 of my friends.**

1) Sometimes on our walk he goes close to hands of people passing by on the sidewalk. I'm not sure if he's only sniffing them, a few months ago he jumped and rammed on a man on the street. He didn't bite or growl. I was stunned!

2) Today he did exactly the same thing to a 10-12 year old boy (and that's what made me write this post

3)He nipped 2 of my friends when they came to my house. He did the same thing on both: followed them, and no warning. This happened last week. He almost did the same thing to some workers we had in the house few months ago.

All of these were without any warning!

4) He never barks at people on the street or in the park. He mostly just stares at them while they pass by. But he gets carried away by the other dogs



My thoughts:


Ad 1 &amp; 2) I don't know why he does that to people on the street


Ad 3) Two very similar situations (friends and workers): people that didn't really greet him walked confidently around the house (workers doing their job and friends carrying stuff around preparing for barbecue). I think it's just a warning: ""I don't know you, this is my house.""


Ad 4) Acted as the pack did. The problem is other dogs stop on cue

What I'm planning to do:

Click and treat whenever we meet people on the sidewalk.

Wait the boy when he goes to school (stalk lol) and make him sit and stay with treats while boy passes by.

Adopted a ~6 month old lab x and I feel like I'm trying to teach so much at once. She nips/mouths (lightly... for now), puts her paws on top of everything (couch, bed, table etc.) and gets overly excited. She is actually a pretty calm dog most of the time and even calms down pretty quickly after getting really worked up. She rarely barks and is generally happy just lounging about, however with the kids around they obviously excite her every hour or so just being kids.


I'm worried that I'm overwhelming her with trying to teach her many things at once. During the day I have her leashed to me, ""leave it"", ""sit"", &amp; ""her name"". Is this bad to do outside of our normal training sessions since I don't have treats?


Mainly she only jumps/nips me (since she is leashed to me and can't often jump on a kid), the carpet, her leash, whatever is nearby, I usually will just grab the nearest toy and put it under her nose, is that counter productive?


I don't want her leashed to me forever! I am slowly teaching both kids the ""off"" command and ""stop"" + turn around (for when the dog is too excited or they no longer want to play). The older one does well with both commands


My house is pretty much dog/child proof and I put away/gated off any areas that housed child toys. We don't leave food on any surfaces &amp; the dog is crated during kid meals.


How can I exercise her with the kids around? Walks are out of the question for exercise since we can only practice loose leash walking 1-2 times a day with a lot of starting + stopping.

I've tried putting the clippers casually around the house where she can see them every day but for instance she wouldn't eat if the clippers were in the same room... 

I've tried counter conditioning but she wouldn't take any treats. I tried raw meat, pretty much anything she'd be happy to steal from my fridge if she got the opportunity, but she was just too stressed to eat anything around those damned clippers. 

***So

I recently read Don't Shoot the Dog by Karen Pryor and in the chapter about negative reinforcement she talks about shy llamas. The way people train the llamas not to run away is to reward not running by going away themselves. Kind of like BAT training. So I tried this with the clippers

It's been a week and I can touch the clippers to her claw while holding it. I can even put the clippers around her claw for a few seconds. Holy shit you guys. She just stands **perfectly still** and waits for me to stop and put the clippers away. If I would show this to her previous owner they'd probably believe I'd drugged her or something. This has been gnawing on my conscience since I bought her and finally I can see some progress. It's god damn amazing.

Sorry for wall of text. **TL;DR: My dog thinks cats are awesome and wants to play with them

I've had a now 7 month old labrador mix for about a month and a half, and he wants to play with them. Anyhow, it would be ok if we were just coming across random cats on walks, but two little kittens were born in June/July in my yard, and they were so thin when their mother left them that I started feeding them on my little terrasse bit of the yard. So now they're used to hanging out right outside my French windows. 


The problem is that when they're around, biting the frames, barking, whining, and crying. And the cats don't help because when they see him, they paw at the windows.


So far, and I've put loads of pepper/rosemary/vinegar stuff outside the windows, but they don't seem to mind that much! I only have one big room downstairs, and Mistral doesn't know how to go up the stairs, so putting him in another room isn't possible. Also, we live in France, and crate-training would be considered cruelty to animals

Anyhow, whatever, I'd love to hear them. And to thank you for reading all this, here is [a video of Mistral with his first piece of carrot!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpeIQH61j8). And [a picture too](http://i.imgur.com/Qe5A5.jpg) from when he was 5.5 months old and where you can see a cat sneaking up on him!

We adopted a 6 week old puppy (Starbuck) about a year ago from a local rescue. Her mother was found pregnant wondering on the side of the road in Florida. The mother got adopted and soon after all the puppies were adopted. 



I got a call from the rescue 3 months ago. The mother had been given back due to her fear issues. We went to meet her



We got her home and began working on some of her issues. She is obviously petrified of men. She runs hides and begins whimpering. I have had no luck with my husband getting through to her. She is still shy. We have tried working with a male trainer on this



Another factor is that we have found multiple cigarette burns on her. As well as a few scars from gashes. She cowers when I go to pet her sometimes. 



But the kicker on this whole story started 4th July. I expected her to be shaky but when the night came round it was a whole other ordeal. She was almost convulsing



I sat up with her all night making sure she was breathing and hugging her until the morning. I have contacted so many trainers. Most of them want over $1000 to train her for her fears. I would pay it in a heartbeat



She has finally started barking and wagging at me a little. She also has begun to come up to me on her own and started to play with her toys! One huge difference recently is that she has started to chew bones and play games with the other dogs. Mainly it is at 3am when we are trying to sleep. But any improvement is welcome at this point.


We have tried a few things to help with her fears:
1. I take her every Sunday to the pet store to buy bones. (Sadly
2. Spending some time one on one with her at night. 
3. Let her play with some of the neighborhood dogs. She loves other dogs!
4. Giving her treats for coming up to us. Again.... The problem here is getting her to accept the treats from our hands. We have been putting them close to her and hoping the other dogs dont steal them before she gets to them.

If anyone has any good advice or different techniques for dealing with a fearful dog it would be very appreciated. 

We are going to dedicate an hour per day to working with her for rehabilitation.

Just some back ground I am an intern with the canine behavior team at the second largest shelter in my state. I have had a good amount of experience with guardian breeds especially those that have severe behavior issues ranging from fear aggression to kennel stress to simple house breaking issues.

So one of my favorite dogs at the shelter turned into a bite case as he drew blood on an intern (not out of aggression as he would have likely been put down).

 He is now out of bite quarantine and thankfully above ground. He is however, lots of people, the cleaning process, etc are all very hard on the dogs). Pit bulls especially and most bully breeds fall victim to this as they spend more and more time in the shelter. This pit bull has already bitten one person and is going nuts. This is a major killer of these dogs in shelter environments.

So what do I do? Not just work with him in the training rooms and outside but lock myself in his kennel to give him massage and work on stress reduction with him. Helping show that his kennel is not just a place of confinement but also where happy fun times and relaxation happen. This is critical in helping reduce the stress and keeping him adoptable.

So lets recap on my brilliant choice of hobby 

* 1) Work with guardian breeds almost exclusively 
* 2) Make sure they are the breeds that can really mess you up 
* 3) Find the craziest one of the lot 
* 4) wait for them to come out of bite quarantine 
* 5) lock your self in a space smaller than your closet with them in hopes you can help make him less crazy.

I thought we could discuss the concept of generalization. I was thinking about this as it seems as though Carlin (20 month old Australian Cattle Dog) is particularly good at generalizing (at least in my limited experience).

For example, he rears up and hits it with both front paws.

Well, on a hot day during a heat wave), he met some friendly, calm children (age 7- 8ish?) who politely asked if they could play with him. Carlin LOVES kids, and is exceptionally calm with them, so I agreed. I showed the kids Carlin's repertoire of tricks, which includes high five. Then one kid asked if he could do the high five with Carlin, not thinking he would do it. The kid says ""high five"" in a high pitched

This really didn't surprise me, after teaching ""up"" (which is my command for jump onto this thing) in my basement, he would jump onto a bench at the park, or a crate at the pet store, with no extra coaching.

I have a corgi that used to be great with other dogs. As a pup until he was about 2 years old he loved to play with them. He's now 3 years old. I noticed a change in his behavior last fall when he saw another dog but wouldn't let her sniff him. He didn't bark aggressively but just kind of 'woofed' when he saw her and seemed scared.

Anyway, but needed to make sure he was fine with other dogs before we took him off the leash (he is a pretty obedient dog otherwise, great on leash, and off leash even with other people around). Well, the first dog he saw he completely flipped when they came too close. Started barking aggressively.. and honestly it looked like he was protecting me more than anything. I just couldn't snap him out of it, we had to leave.

I keep hearing that you can't yell at a dog for something they've done while you were away because they won't know what you're yelling at them for. This argument presupposes that a dog can only connect discipline to an act that is immediately happening, some dogs may be dumb, and some owners/trainers may be worse than others at getting their points across to dogs, but dogs evolved into the pets they now are over thousands of years precisely *because* they can understand how we want them to behave. It is crazy to me to think that they can't understand causal relationships because it is precisely this understanding that has brought them into our homes, if they behaved how we wanted them to, we kept feeding them and sheltering them and they lived well enough to breed etc, etc.

The second issue I have with the claim comes from behaviors of guilt that are exhibited by my dog when he's done something wrong while I was gone. **He's exhibiting these guilty (or stressed) behaviors *before I even know he's done something wrong*.** Twice, shaking, and avoiding looking at me. Both times I soon find that he's been digging in the trash. I had no idea he was doing anything until he came in shaking. I have to believe that he knew he screwed up, just couldn't stop himself, but then knew he was going to get busted.  He couldn't have possibly been reacting to me being upset that he got in the trash, because he exhibited guilt (or stress) *before* I knew anything was amiss. Other times I've come home and he's not quite as rambunctious when he greets me, and each time he has also *coincidentally*? chewed something up.

My family owns a wonderful 200lbs St. Bernard

About 3 years ago we discovered that Farley is epileptic. He takes phenobarb (sp?) and potassium bromide to help and thankfully

However in the past few months he has gotten very moody and lethargic. So much so that when I walk into the door to come home he will be laying in the living room and growling from where he’s laying. Sometimes he will bark multiple times - I’ve been taught to ignore this. I thought this may have to do with the fact that I have been working at a different school and he was unwary of the smells

 I’ve grown up with dogs as well as worked in a pet store for a while and have never mistreated him. I’ve even helped to train and walk him before his epilepsy got too bad to walk him on my own. 

 We took him to the vet and after some tests the vet decided to lower his medication to help better his mood. 

But this has taken a turn for the worse for the last few days. Now, and he also refuses to take his medication. I try to have him come to me so that I can give him his meds and reward him, but now I’m only met with growls that get louder and louder as I persist. If I get too close to him during these episodes, he growls even louder and his body begins to puff up. Because of his size, he'll often block the door way into the kitchen and won't budge (I once tried to get him to movie and after 45mins he still wouldn't budge). 

I’m worried there are other issues with him because it’s gotten to the point where he is refusing food. What kind of cuddly beast does not like food?

This dog is very different in personality than our old dog (who was a perfect fit) and yet no one seems to want to address any of the issues that have arisen and are steadily getting worse.

Lobo loved being outside and we could never get her to come in, Jack refuses to stay outside longer than it takes to do his business and will whine constantly until we let him back inside.  Things like that.

The problem is that this fear of abandonment combined with this excess of energy has led to him attacking anyone that comes into the house, so whenever we get into his ""area"" he will immediately start jumping around, attacking your ankles, barking, and generally being a nuisance.  When you pet him or give him any kind of attention, he will stop his excitability and will lay there happily until you stop petting him, then will resume his behavior worse than ever.

Anyway, so I used my supply of chopped up hot dogs. There was one exercise where I was chastised in particular for ""treating Lady too much"", and I will explain it and see what you all think:

- Dogs sat at handler's side in heel position

- One by one

- I treated Lady each and every time she successfully kept her eyes on me while we walked around a person and their dog

- When we got to the end, and I released her briefly and gave her a jackpot.

It was at this point that I was told I'm giving Lady far too many treats

My problem with this thinking is that: 1) My puppy is seven months old and this is literally the first time we did this exercise. I think for her to have given me eye contact with the help of kissy noises and cooing her name, almost useless as a reward. Lady does love being showered with attention, but I know it is not enough to keep her motivated unlike toys or food.

I get that I need to phase her out of being treated constantly in the face of heavy distractions... but not on the first go, who'd been attending classes a lot longer (this is my second with her), that were struggling like mad. I saw a LOT of Malinois and Dutch and German Sheps with prong collars and heavy-handed leash yanking in order to keep their eyes on the ""prize"" of completing the exercise.

We have a new puppy, both crate training and house training were going really well.  This week has been not so much.  I feel like we're having a hard time reconciling to bits of training advice we've read. When you're talking about crate training, people will say that it's important not to give the dog attention for barking, whining, etc., so that they don't come to think that's an effective way to get out of the crate when they need to be there.  On the other hand, that's the only way she has to signal that she needs to go outside.  We're having a hard time distinguishing between the two this week.  Often we take her outside and it was just that she wants to play, only to find that she has either peed or pooped in the crate.

I set off for my evening walk with the instructions in mind, long, short or medium there was always slack. We walked passed some fries someone had dropped and as she went towards them I clicked and back she was by my side to receive some liver cake and carry on her walk.

First
He's an 8 month old GSD.  I've had him since 8 weeks and he has attended puppy classes since about 12 weeks.  Even though he has always mixed with other dogs, for the last two months or so, he has been much more relaxed and generally just ignores other dogs on the street (off of his lead, that is).  These days, when he sees another dog, he will generally just trot past.  Occasionally, there will be a bit of bouncing around and the odd bark, even when he properly mingles with other dogs on walks

When he's on his lead

Now
We moved to our current obedience class a couple of months ago.  Our previous class was a bit old school, I left.  I've done quite a bit of research and reading up on positive methods, so that class was no longer for me.

The new class is based in quite a small hall.  There are around six dogs in the class.  While in the hall, so while the other dogs are doing their things, he likes to watch and have a good bark.  I counter this as much as possible by trying to get him to sit facing me, using the ""watch me"" command etc.  Basically, just distracting him.  This helps, but is hard to keep up for a whole hour and he still gets a good bark off now and then.  Other than being embarrassing, it has never been a serious issue.

A couple of weeks ago, he just randomly barks because he's bored and that sets her off, which in turn sets him off.

The trainer called today and said that she felt that the small hall was exacerbating his behaviour, and then slowly de-sensitise him and move him closer to the other dogs.  Apparently she has a few other dogs with similar issues, so is hoping to have a sort of ""nervous dog class"".

He has always struggled in that particular hall.  Not just with the other dogs, in the garden, or out on a walk.  Just in that hall, which is annoying.

My dog is a 2.5 year old female pitbull/doberman/whoknows? mix, but you'd still be a fool to touch her while eating today.

Ellie has always been fearful of people since I got her, the fearful urination stopped (through socialization), but soon thereafter developed into full fledged growls and sneers.

When a guest comes to the apartment, she becomes fearful again. While in this mode, she will move fairly close to people, seemingly wanting affection (though I know the warning signs of this situation). When she gets touched, she freezes like a dog statue, extends her neck, lowers her head and growls (sometimes sneering) until the touching is over. It's as if she wants to leave, you're asking for a sneer

I used to crate her

Even when she is ""happy"" moving a hand toward her snout often causes her to sneer.

She has bit me several times

I have hired professional trainers, had tests done by my Vet, and followed all the behavioral modification techniques that have been suggested, but to no avail. 

I know that dogs who show little to no aggression signs compared to my dog can bite

At this point, we're pals. She's incredibly obedient, she gets more exercise than Richard Simmons, she's a frisbee master, and she'll even snuggle with me. That's why I call her Jekyll and Hyde dog.

I have come to terms with the fact that I should probably put her down

So Surprise has issues with other dogs. She used to get into what we thought were dominance fights with Lily, Lily wasn't in danger.

She grabbed him and was shaking him by the neck, trying to kill him -- wouldn't let go even when lifted off the ground. After that, she has been basically stalking him around the house, sneaking up on him and attacking him. Hobo is old, etc. Very bad situation. My mom (I am away in college

Roscoe will be hanging out on the couch, and Daisy would come from another room and attack him.  And because she's so much bigger than him, he can't defend himself.  It's really scary.  We decided to call a behaviorist but the one we were recommended isn't available for another couple weeks.  He told us to keep Daisy on a leash in the mean time to control her aggressive outbursts.

Roommates come home

Roommates come out of the bathroom

Roommates come out of their room

Roommates walk by my room


Back-story;
So my mom got Tiger at about 6months from the pound, listened to sit, down, stay, and come, but at he grew her apartment complex made her give him up to me because he grew over their weight limit.  I love dogs and glady took him.  Me and my roommate, played with him all the time, and he was fine.  His only issue was he was VERY submissive and any time I tried to teach him commands and such he would get very low, very afraid

After about two years that roommate moved out and i got a series of other roommates.  Tiger would bark at every one of them any time they got home.  They would all just completely ignore him.  One roommate who was here for about 3 years would come home, he never did any of this.  Very few of my roommates since the original made any attempt to play with or pet tiger.  About 2 years ago ago I had a girl roommate in the room near the front of the house, she would do the same thing, ignore him.  Then about 6months ago Tiger started barking a little more agressively at her when she would get out of the bathroom.  At this point in time my method was calling him to my room and putting him in a down-stay. Right about that time i FINALLY found a treat he would actually eat right away (before all treats he would sniff cautiously, grab, drop on the floor, sniff, lick, then slowly eat. Kinda hard to use as a reward when he does that) So I started giving him these treats as reward when he didn't bark at people around the house.  Sadly about 2 weeks after the agressive barking started he apparently bit her, and threaten to have him put to sleep).  She moved out soon after that and another guy moved into the front room.  I made a big effort finding really dog friendly people to live in the house

He still barks at them but the situation has improved *dramatically*

The only issue is they don't do the treat thing as much any more and he had a pretty major relapse yesterday.  The roomate next to me leaves his door open all time time when he leaves and my dog loves to go in and sleep on his bed. He was in the kitchen, he yells No loudly, etc, I run out immediately, clap my hands and tiger runs into my room and I put him in a down-stay.  He didn't seem to react to my roommate yelling but only when I clapped.  Side note, He also only does the barking if I'm in my room or not near him, if i'm around he's *always* super friendly and playful.  But If I leave the house he gets depressed or something and is fine around my roommates.

So i'm probably going to have another talk with my roommates about giving Tiger treats when he's not barking so they keep it up again but I'd like to know if I'm handling this right and what else I can do?

I have a 20 week old cocker/poodle cross, he knew 'sit' a few days after I got him (at eight weeks), he knows 'stay', 'lie down', 'paw', 'the other paw', 'roll over', after a rocky start

My one issue is that his recall
When it came to being able to take him on walks, the better, as they will want to stay near you, and won't stray very far. However on here, I see the general consensus is to keep them on the lead until their recall is perfect.

The (few) times I let him off the lead, as he has zero attention on me, so he doesn't notice. 

I have started to walk him in a different spot, to allow him to run off his energy. When we do these walks, his recall is fantastic. Every time I call him, he comes running, regardless of how far away he is.

But now

Does anybody have any suggestions as to how I should proceed with this? I would love it if he didn't have the urge to tear after everything he sees

I picked him up last night and things were great -- he was super playful and happy and we went for a long walk with my husband to tire him out so he's sleep well. We've met a handful of times before and he's been over at my apartment with his owners before

Getting ready for the morning walk, he started growling at me (mean growl). So then I backed off a bit, sat across the room and started talking to him. In response, he started snarling at me. Then he darted for his crate across the room, and kept snarling at me. I figured he needed to calm down so I brought his blanket (from his house) and dropped it in the top of the crate. Still snarling, he now starts snapping and trying to nip me without getting out of his crate, to the point where I can't even close the lid, like and hour later, he went from play to hide under the table and snarl. I've been ignoring for while I've been typing this and he's starting to venture out from under the table. But when I was first ignoring him

So I know this puppy hasn't gotten a lot of good socialization, and consequently doesn't behave like most dogs that got to spend their first 8-10 weeks with mom and litter. I get that he thinks this apartment is new turf and he's trying to stake out his piece (he also doesn't necessarily recognize me as an authority, just an annoyance and so he thinks he's trying to compete with me). But how do I strike a balance for 3 days between helping this pupping to not feel stressed and not letting him push me around (with the end goal that he not go psycho on or injure me or anyone else before my friend's get back) ? Do I keep doing what I'm doing and wait it out or is there another way ?

Any help would be greatly appreciated !!!

1. Dogs to crazy at the door, it's really, really bad. Nearly uncontrollable.

2. So the younger dog goes crazy whenever he sees a person and especially a dog, he might look to me and make a whine like he's just feverish. He just wants to play and bark.

The older one, especially), he gets a bit spooked and might jump up and bite their jacket or something. If he sees another dog while on leash, the hair will go up on end and he won't listen (he might know not to pull, until the dogs get close) and then he'll be a bit vicious. 

There was a particularly bad incident recently where he ran out the door (mistake!) and just started attacking some guy outside, he sometimes lashes out, he's just an old grump kind of thing), I take him to big parties and crowds of people just fine. It seems to be due to his age. He has no problems with dogs at the dog park, it just seems to be a leash aggression.

About a month ago, she came home, and whoever had ripped down the original (rude) note, left hers hanging. Okay...


Well, so she went to grab him to bring inside since people were out there. As she goes outside, an older couple is yelling at her, telling her to ""shut up your fucking dog!""

Some

BAT

&gt; Other techniques teach that the scary thing goes away. ""See this spider? You're kind of uncomfortable. If you're good

.

&gt; Here's the Phd answer simplified.

&gt; If you aren't over threshold

&gt; So

&gt; Because it doesn't WANT to go away

&gt; Some people use a different definition. But generally speaking, the dog is feeling stress.

&gt; Which is why the definition I use is

&gt; Easy rule to remember. Try to pick the dog's threshold. Start working double the distance away. Keeps you from being accidentally wrong.

Sorry for the long story here

I've always dreamed of getting a German Shepherd

A while ago my sister really wanted me to get a dog, no parents)

She kept insisting I get a dog

I explained that if we got a dog, and I would train and walk it in the morning, all up, an hour of serious commitment a day, plus playing time with the dog.

I explained to her that a German Shepherd would grow up to be large one day

She agreed that we would raise it together

So we purchased a pure breed GSD from a breeder. 2 days later my alarm bells went off when she said ""I can't believe how much work it is looking after a puppy.""

The first few days she keeps wanting to wrestle with the puppy and throw him around etc. because he is ""so cute"". I keep telling her not to, but the consequences may lead to more play biting and wrestling as he gets bigger and older.

We take him to puppy school

About 3 months in, down, stay etc. fairly well as can be expected for his age. I go away to the US for a 2 week holiday. Additionally she is complaining that he is constantly biting her when they play. (He doesn't really bite me.)

When I come back

She re-instates her share of clicker training with the dog

A few weeks later I notice that he is starting to be more and more hyperactive when I get home, and to continue to train him to reinforce a bond and relationship with the dog.

Alas

So now we have reached a point where he walks perfectly for me, he is hyperactive and underexercised, and i'm exhausted from the days work. The very reason I didn't want to get a dog in the first place. 

He's now become very aggressive on the lead with her

When I am with him he behaves perfectly.

So I now feel that i'm in a situation where I am solely responsible for a dog in a situation I never wanted. 

I figure I will just have to suck it up and take him for 2 long walks (I do about an hour walk each morning + throw balls/frisbees in the park + training and play time at home in the morning

I can walk him another hour when I get home. I guess the question I have is..

Is there something I can do training wise to improve his behaviour walking with OTHER people?

I wish I could be there for all his walks and do everything with him. I love this dog more then anything

If it comes down to it

Thanks for reading

1360915986.0,18km6j,6 month old puppy refusing to accept 2 week old new female puppy the house.,Everlilly,14,0,24,"**[EDIT: woah I cant edit the title but to be clear

Hi everyone

I have two puppies

The male is 6 months old, a dream to train and picks up new ""tricks"" within just a few repetitions.. Is polite with his food (sits and ""shakes hands"" then waits to be given permission to eat) and was pretty well adapted, as far as we can tell. 

He was quite fearful when we first got him, but as soon as they're inside, he's their best friend.

Cut forward to now and we have decided to get a new puppy. A girl, so I thought it would be a relatively easy change for him.

They get along really well and they wrestle/play for a good portion of the day

**The problem is that Teddy does not seem to want to share ANYTHING with Harley.** 

For example if I treat them with a raw carrot or a chew toy for their teeth, I'm having to constantly intervene from him trying to steal hers, or him growling/barking because she is eating and he isn't. Sometimes he wont even wait until he is finished his. I gave them half of a raw carrot each this morning and he took his AND hers and barked/growled if she tried to come near them. I ended up having to crate her with her half so she could have it at all.

A similar thing happens with toys. We took away ALL his toys before she came so he couldn't get possessive of them and introduced new ones.. but any time she will be chewing on something if she is not safety crated away from him he will steal it from her and jump up onto a high surface she cant reach and just stare at her with it in his jaws.

This means she's bored and she ends up chewing on the carpet

I understand that this is something similar to ""Only Child Syndrome"" and Teddy is trying to adjust

What concerns me is that Harley is a gorgeous little girl but she's rapidly devolving (as puppies do) based on the treatment she's receiving from Teddy.

What can I do to help Teddy get past this? Has anyone else ever gone through this before?

Halp!

Situation:

I have a 1.5 year old golden retriever. Super smart

I have issues keeping his focus if I don't have a smelly treat for him. In an isolated setting it is no issue, held around my sternum... in that case once he gets a whiff he will look at my hand (and thus generally at my face) and stay with me whichever direction I turn. It's fantastic. I feel great. He looks like a champ. Then I try it treatless and it is hit or miss... sometimes good sometimes not (never great), I have to work really hard at getting him keep looking at me (i.e. 'watch me'). Usually he'll glance at me, fall in line, but then start scanning the floor or the room as we move forward.

As a general rule I have been variable in when I give him treats to try and wean him off of food rewards for properly following commands, which was great for working on recall but sucks for anything else).

A suggestion from our trainer is to help get him acclimated to looking at my face rather than my hand but giving treats by mouth (haha not what you think). I did this to help reinforce 'watch me' early on, he focuses on the hand (which is true just from watching where his eyes are focused). My worry is that while this helps get him looking at my face rather than my hand, isn't necessarily helping with the core focus problem.

• ALL the dogs were on martingale collars or ""humane choke collars"". Although not entirely choke collars

• The owners were taught to push on the rear end of the dog to make them sit. I don't think this teaches the dog to actually want to sit and therefore sit on command in the future.

I called one of the only places i could find in town for pet-training(pet-co) and took him in. When I got him there they told me he was to misbehaved to be there

So my real question is that i live close to a school and kids and parents are walking by every morning and afternoon. Could i just sit at outside my front door with a leash on him of course and slowly over the course of a few weeks more closer to the sidewalk?

She was in the process of buying a new house on five acres of farm/bushland so she couldn't take one immediately

So mum, not to chew things she shouldn't (okay...she *kinda* got that one), basic commands (sit, stay, lay down, shake).  She was a strong dog (that staffy muscle!) and could be quite tough to walk, and she got crazy excited whenever someone would turn up to the house.  But overall, we managed to turn her into a moderately well behaved and incredibly friendly dog.

Then she went to live with mum...

The first problem was that they just didn't think about fences.  They refused to do any more than patch jobs on the fences, shot... Well, over the year she went from a sweet dog that wouldn't hurt a fly to hunting down wallabies and killing them.  Then mum complains when she caught the dog going for their new lamb.  Don't they realise that they let her develop that behaviour!?  

Now that it's summer mum's worried about snakes so the dog can't go for her runs any more.  But she's used to them now.  She's used to exploring and chasing animals and burning up all of that energy.  Now that she's confined to the yard again she's started destroying things because she has so much pent up energy and is probably really bored.

I suggested taking her to doggy day care once a week but she said it's too expensive.  So I suggested they take her to the bushland fully fenced dog park on weekends but she said she already does enough driving (it's probably about 25 minutes from their house).

Mum seems at the end of her tether but unwilling to put in the effort that is needed.  Which infuriates me!  I hate it when people get a dog but don't commit to doing what is needed to keep the dog happy and well trained.

I'm so worried that they're going to give her up.  I love this dog

I offered to have the dog around for play dates once a week, did everything I told her to do, and she seemed so content snuggled up next to me all day as I did my work (which makes me think that maybe a lot of the problem is separation anxiety).

I have two 3 month old pomchi puppies. I'm in the process of teaching them everything

The one that doesn't get it got a hold of my Nintendo DS charger and chewed the plug (not the socket part but the part that goes into the DS) off of the wire.  I didn't want him chewing it because the bare wires were showing now and it was still plugged in and i also didn't want him chewing on plastic he could swallow so i gave the command drop it tempted him with some delicious treats but he was content on keeping the charger with him.  

because of the exposed wire part i decided to grab it out of his reach (90% of the time he doesnt growl or care)

this time he did.  he snapped and tried to bit me. got me in the hand but it didn't hurt because hes so small.

after i got it away i felt around the blanket he was sittin on to see if i missed any pieces and he tried two more times to bite and snap at my hand.

It was aggression.

What do you recommend I do if the drop it or leave it or tempting with treats thing doesn't work (or they haven't learned it yet) 

or if hes chewing something dangerous or valuable to me that i accidentally drop and tries to bite me violently... how do i discipline him after this.  

sure i can try to avoid it

yes i AM n the process of teaching them the commands but i need to know what to do RIGHT after he bites me not how to avoid it .

I think some background is important. We adopted a pair of rescue dogs as a bonded pair, don't bark when my neighbours stick their head over the fence, etc.

But when we go on walks and either see another dog on the road, he still gets very upset, squirmy, focused on them, and barking, but I can usually ""Let's go"" multiple times and drag him past the situation. I don't think he is interested in playing and he definitely is not focused in me. I tend to encourage/drag him past it but to be honest he isn't listening to me and I'm just dragging him.

I feel like once I've lost him to the situation (as much as I try not to, he gets treats when we are just walking normally or when he ignores a distant dog, not just after a close range episode with another dog.

I should add that we start doggy training last week. At first it was an epic disaster, but the dog trainer said he was still very stressed and we had to leave half an hour into the class.

I still really want to understand why this dog seems so intent on running off. What *is* that behavior? A few times he's just started to bolt off in a random direction (Stopped by the leash), he was off leash when he just started to sniff, sniff, sniff, and wandered very far away before I was able to collect him again (That was the *last* time he was off leash in an unenclosed area). At that point, he was out of sight and didn't seem to have any intentions of coming back.

Keith is an 11 mo. old lab/collie mix (we think). We got him

I'll just take a second to run through Keith's issues: Keith has always been a ravenous eater. I guess he starved at some point before we got him. He developed a fear of people coming around him while he eats at around 5-6 mo. He is never aggressive towards people, barks) if he feels he gets into a situation that is threatening. We aren't too worried about this and try to work on teaching him to be comfortable (if a dog gets near his stuff he gets pissed).

Next, and reached into his area before I had a chance to warn him and the dog. This scared Keith and he bit him. It is the first time he has bit someone and it is very upsetting. But, i know why he bit him. He was scared and defended himself, in his eyes.

Then yesterday the worst part, Keith was snuggled up on the couch with my girlfriend and I. As she is petting him, he snarls and shows his teeth. We get him off the couch and I go to approach him, he is clearly uncomfortable and growls and snaps at me. Later that night and in to today he has been very bi-polar between normal Keith and scared Keith.

Now i'm worried, children, and other dogs.

These are the problems, if we can. I'll be honest in saying that i'm hesitant to commit years to nurturing him to a level of normalcy when it seems he could go off on us, other dogs, or strangers.

He's still not really into treats or play as a reward but he'll take lunchmeat turkey most of the time.  I've discovered that he also really responds to the cues from other dogs.  He met my friend's corgi last weekend and they immediately were total bros.  We took them to a fenced in dog park and when my guy saw his bro totally relaxed and comfortable in the car

The insecurity does have its advantages--he has great recall when he's out and about in the park--I called his name and ran off once and now he always comes back to me.  He still cringes when we call him or try to get him to follow us in the house but we've circumvented the potty issue at least by teaching him to go to the door when we say ""outside"".  When we go to the door

He's doing well with clicker training and oddly enough, so I started treating him too.

He is a 10 month old, down, come (most of the time), leave it, etc.  In class we were supposed to be leaning/teaching the heel command using a chain choke collar.  I tried practicing with him, but he was just in that stage (note: before he got fixed) where he did not want to listen like a rebellious teenager.  The choke collar seemed to not affect him at all; he would pull right through it and not respond when I would tighten it up.

Before the class and even now, a large park, the dog park, erie canal. He is very good about not running away at places like these.  If he is off leash and there is a person far away, I can get him on his leash by making him come and sit or by turning around to walk the other way and he will follow.

When he does need to be on his leash, but it makes it so much easier for us to go on runs around the neighborhood.  

So pulling is issue number 1

He barks at strangers, specifically) it really bothers other people.  I am confident he would never bite anyone except maybe if I was being attacked, but his barking has become an issue.  If he is off his leash and he runs by someone he doesn't know, he will stop within 3 feet (never get closer) and bark continuously at him/her.  Dog lovers understand and don't mind him, but most people get scared.  It is basically like a small, yippee dog that is barking at somebody, except he is huge and has a scary bark!  His hair stands up initially, his tail would go between his legs and he backs off.

When we go by somebody and he is on the leash, he will *not* jump at strangers, it is only if he is on the leash.  I am pretty strong for a person my size, and can control him fairly well, but he is right on my limit and it makes people (and myself) uncomfortable.  Also I should mention he pulls *hard* when he sees other dogs because he really wants to play.  He is fantastic with other dogs (chases, wrestles, avoids aggressive dogs/fights, but always wants to play and nearly rips my arm out trying to get to them.

Since his problems are very situation-specific I'm not sure what to do.  He is overall a very good boy, but I don't think that should be an answer to the problem and he is so high energy that he needs his exercise.

Hey everyone

We have both read positive training books by Ian Dunbar and Pat Miller. We are planning on taking the first week off of work between the both of us and crate training to make potty training and getting a consistant schedule down easier. 

I really want to make the crate a great place for her. I am hoping that after 5 days at our place she will be comfortable staying in her crate for 3 hours at a time during the day. We have family to come by and let her out at 10am and 1pm then we get home at 4pm. I am hoping to slowely increase her time in the crate over the first few days so this won't be a surprise for her once the day hits we both head to work. Is this the best way to set up for success?

My other biggest goal in the first few weeks is to bring the dog out every hour or so to go potty and reward greatly any time she goes outside in her spot. I am going to get the whole family on the same page so when other people bring her out we all do the same thing and use the same words such as ""go potty"".

My last goal is to get everybody (we have tons of family and friends that are so excited to meet/play with the dog) to reward calm behavior with her food, a puppy kong that looks like a bone, and a elk antler to munch on. We are signing her up for puppy socialization classes on saturday mornings and a puppy obedience class. Both will be at 12 weeks once she gets her final shots. 

I hope this wall of text isn't to much rambling and I appreciate anybody who takes the time to read through and offer advice. I think I am just anxious / nervous about raising a bad dog and need some reinforcment that I am on the right track. Only my wife and I are up to date on dog training and our families are a little less into the whole ""training thing"". For example

The trouble with the dog has always been there

The real trouble is when it comes to any amount of training. This dog will not even SIT unless you trick her into thinking you have food. I think this comes from gf giving the dog food from the table (which I have protested about 1 billion times, yelps as if I were beating her relentlessly when I go to just barely spank her (making gf think that I am abusive), and if she shits in the house, she shits in MY OFFICE (where my computer, books, etc is). I think she is being a spiteful little shit, I'm not going to lie. She did it at the old house we had with and in the new apartment. Wherever my stuff is

Now here is the real trouble, and she would not go to the restroom for me AT ALL. I did all the tricks, took her to her favorite spot, used an encouraging voice, I even have one of the variable length leashes so that I can follow her at a large distance and give her some privacy. She just wouldn't do it. I even stood outside with her, walked her around the entire complex 3 times, probably a total 30 to 45 min walk, it all started when she chewed up the remote to our surround sound system that we just got

I suppose what I'm saying is: I need some help with this dog that I a) don't have to go to a dog trainer for, hoping for some good insight), and c) can (at the very least) just lay down some foundation to improve my relationship with this dog. This girl means everything to me and I am honestly doing my best to make it work with this dog, usually when gf is here everything is fine but when gf is gone (like she is for this whole week and then some) the dog is a demon and won't listen to me at all. 

Now my absolute last resort is that I can drop the dog off at the dog hotel thing like gf and I did when we went home for xmas

TL;DR - GF's dog is a little demon when GF isn't around

**EDIT: Wow, it is too many posts to respond individually but I can assure you all that every post will be taken into account over the next couple of weeks (and beyond, in fact).

This month officially marked the 2 year mark that I have had my heeler/border collie/lab/who knows what, and I have worked HARD to keep her intelligence and energy in check. She knows a host of commands very well, including both paws, rolling over, spinning in the air, crawling, the list goes on, despite large efforts on my part to socialize her well

It's hard to pinpoint when exactly it began, but has delivered a few unexpected nips that do not break the skin, or leave any mark at all, but still, no growling or anything, just nips someone when they try to navigate the house without paying attention to her (in their bum), or if they suddenly and quickly move their hand toward her face.

I am desperate to end this behavior. I have tried the following:

* flipping her on her back and showing dominance after she barks. (she is very quick to submit to me)

* restraining her and allowing the stranger to pet her.

* putting her in her kennel after barking.

* putting her in her kennel before the stranger enters the house.

* putting her in a separate room before the stranger enters the house.

* having treats outside the front door and having all strangers throw a few at her as they enter (she completely ignores the treats).

In all of these instances, I have two question for anyone willing to help:

About a week ago we took him (Niko) to the river by himself. We have a 15metre rope that we clip him too that we can tie to a tree because otherwise he wouldn't come back to us. So we were swimming and everything was fine until I noticed a couple walking their dogs along the bank. Niko noticed them and it went from 0-10 in 2seconds. He charged the other dogs and ran to the end of the rope and choking himself out. Then he got up and charged them again. I am positive that if the rope had of snapped

A week later I got some kibble and sprinkled it all around our yard
Yesterday all three of them were playing and Niko bit the female on the back

Later that night

I thought maybe it could be a jealously issue. So today I let Niko into the loungeroom with just him and I and gave him a bone to chew and some attention. When he was done I let him back out to the other dogs and the puppy went over to kiss him and he snarled

Fig is an 11mo, he can get rambunctious, but he always plays nicely and has never started a fight. 

Thing is, others tell him to back off; when they do, he does - briefly - then usually tries again. 

My response so far has been to stay nearby so I can pull him off if he mounts another dog, he will stop and play nicely. 

I understand he's asserting dominance and trying to establish himself at the top of the dog park hierarchy, there's no aggression, no snarling or snapping on his part, but when he meets a MORE dominant dog than himself there can be problems even before the humping starts - he's been snarled and snapped at by dominant males, and recently a particularly cranky 13mo standard poodle really went for him as soon as he entered the park.

Is this all just a necessary part of doggy interaction? Am I doing more harm than good in pulling him off and giving him a time out? Is there a better way to handle it?

2) Your dog is aggressive.  Don't socialize it by taking it to an _extremely_ crowded beach and then letting it around off leash.  Our dog did _not_ trigger his dog

Final straw was when he started peeing on the suede coach. So I researched how to crate train and he's doing awesome! Only thing is that we still can't leave him alone. If left in a room alone for literally less than a minute we risk him peeing on the furniture

I realized my training I tried right before the crate was wrong because we tried the nose-rub method and I think he just got confused. Now I think he is scared to pee or poop in front of us. He's never in his life done his business on walks and I can sit outside with him for over an hour and he won't go unless he thinks I'm not looking so I have to try to catch him out of my peripheral to give him praise. 

I really want to fix this thing I've done. Ive never had a dog before and my ignorance is apparent. I think he'd have done great if we'd started with a crate from the beginning. Where do I go from here? I want to be able to trust him to be alone long enough so I can go to the bathroom without taking him with me.

Everything has been going really well with my 5 and a half month old bullmastiff in terms of training. He is fully crate trained; gets put in his crate at about 11pm and doesn't wake up or want out until 10am the next morning (I feel like I won the puppy lottery in this aspect). He knows leave it to the point where you can put his favourite treat right under his nose and he won't take it until you say ""okay."" He is doing well on meeting new people and dogs (he used to get way over-excited and thought everyone should play with him) and we are now able to get him to hold a (admittedly wiggly) sit while people and dogs come up and say hello. 

Recently however we have been facing a new behaviour with him: sitting on walks. When we first started leash training him, tried to chase every small animal he saw, and was just in general a real ordeal. 

But we've been working really hard with him over the past few months (using the stopping until he came back and focused on us was grueling, as it became a real joy to walk him (although even when it wasn't so pleasant we made sure to get him out at least twice a day). 

Then, but all his previous walks have been when it is still light out. He was clearly uncomfortable on the walk (extra alert, ears back) and when he heard an animal rustling in the bushes he plastered himself to my leg and tucked his tail between his legs. I knew I had done too much, too fast in this new environmental setting and so turned around and headed home. 

I'm worried though that I have damaged his confidence on walks. Since that nighttime walk he now has a new habit of sitting down on a walk (for reasons I can't always detect) and looking around. He doesn't seem scared (his body language suggests that he's not, construction workers using power tools, but other times I can't figure out what has caused him to stop and sit.

I am able to lure him back into a walk with treats after quite a bit of coaxing, but he was stuck in a sit for almost 10 minutes yesterday and wouldn't budge even for treats.

In the last few days, we ignore her, and she'll go back to sleep.

She isn't displaying any behaviors that make us think that it is the crate itself she doesn't like, and when we open the door to let her out, she still calmly waits for us to put on the harness (also just like before).  

It is just when we leave the room after putting her in the crate that her behavior has changed from quiet whining to loud crying.

The only two things that have happened in the last week is that she had a bacterial infection, full energy/appetite).  The other thing that happened is that on Monday, she was playing with a (slightly) bigger dog and the dog knocked her down a few times, kind of hard, but not enough for her to stop playing or yelp or run to me or anything that would make me think anything was wrong.  But maybe she hurt something?  The last few days she's been walking/running the same as always, so I don't really think it is that.

So,5 year old Belgian Shepherd cross, Oscar. This post is about Oscar.

We got him 1

Oscar is affectionate, so when he is alone, we crate him. The first year we had him, we didn't have dog-related problems with him. He got along with 98% of other dogs and went to the dog park regularly to play with them.

The problems started after we moved house, the new puppy 5 months. I would think that's enough time for him to get used to the new situation?

What started at soft growling at 2% of dogs we passed, snapping and acting really nasty. We don't pull him away hurredly or punish him for behaving that way, instead we park him in a sit and try to reward him for calm behavior. If we have enough time, we talk to the other owner so we can slowly, gradually get Oscar closer to their dog. Sometimes, we can get him close, he sniffs the other dog and is fine. Most times, not.

We consulted a behaviorist who gave us above tips. He is coming back to see Oscar again later this week.
In the mean time

He is neutered, and afterwards play and running in the yard with the puppy. When left alone, we have a dog walker come for an hour, we give him a frozen stuffed Kong and chew toys.
Whew

I guess I should be the first to admit, so I am hoping that some of you may be able to offer some advice.

My roommate and I adopted Punky, but sometimes I think that maybe he was a failed show dog. His mannerisms are a bit odd. He doesn't really know typical commands, and we have taught him some things (like sit, and wait -- for when we feed him). He is also crate trained and does not have a problem being in his house. He goes right into when I ask him to, and sometimes I'll find him just chilling in his house sleeping or chewing on somethings, so I know he is comfortable with it.

There is also another dog living with us (the other roommates dog). They get along well

The big problems that I have since found are :

# 1 : MARKING and PISSING on things.  --- Last night, and am leaving the cushions outside in the sun to hopefully help with the smell  : ( probably will need a new couch eventually.

#2:  OBSESSIVE LICKING --- its like he thinks that I am a giant salty meat stick. Maybe this is something that he is OCD about and I just have to live with

#3 :  OVERALL OBEDIENCE --- I don't think he sees me, and not the other way around (lol) Honestly, my whole life, no one has taken me seriously, why should a 15 lb dog? *sigh*

Like I said, because she was going through a rough time and really wanted a pet to help her (you know, animal therapy) I was ok with this, knowing that she would be finding a new job soon (she had been laid off). She is a flight attendant and is based in NYC so she isn't around a lot right now, but in the future she will be home more (she now has more predictable schedule). We are also both in our early 30's

I am definitely going to have a sit down with her about what we need to do. Any training we give him needs to be consistent and I don't think she understands that. I work with him a little when he is gone

I just need ideas on an approach for this -- dog training classes is def on the list

So I'm a fairly timid person. I've never really envisioned my future as owning my own business or anything like that. I've pretty much always wanted to work *for* someone. Mainly because I have no interest in business and know next to nothing about how to run one. 

I've been kinda toying around the idea of becoming a dog trainer for quite a while now and have been mainly blowing it off because I don't know a lot about training dogs.. yet. (I have a major interest in it, and money) breed Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.) I think in the last week I've finally realized- ""Hm, I don't have to be an expert before I even get started in the field. I can learn about it first. Duh."" No brainer to most people. 

Anyway, or once I'm more financially stable.)

So

Maybe I should take a business class at my local college? Is it plausible for me to hire someone to do all the business-y stuff or is that just silly?

I have a four year old male cat, or so I thought - turns out puppy had a respiratory infection, so his energy was way down. They cuddled and played, but now that puppy is back to what I'm guessing is his normal high energy level, it seems to be a bit much for the cat.

As a first time dog owner, licks the cat's genitals a LOT, and play bites the cat. The cat generally tolerates it for a short time, then will run off. The only playing the cat does with the dog now is hiding under things and jumping out to swat at him. The cat doesn't seem angry or scared-more annoyed, and even enjoys being licked (in the non-naughty areas) by the dog. The cat is a rough player himself (he wears soft paws though), and tries to initiate play occasionally, but seems to be turned off by puppy's roughness. 

The dog isn't trained at all - he spent his whole life in a shelter - so we are just working on sit, at the moment. He is signed up for obedience classes but they don't start until next month. I currently crate the dog while I'm away at work etc, although I'd eventually like to let him have the run of the house - which will not be possible unless I'm certain the cat will be safe.

For instance, and not in *any* sort of ""aww he's scared, how adorable"" or ""teehee that's funny"" way. We're talking abject *terror*.

He expresses overt ""I'm fucking terrified that I'm going to die right now"" body language and sits (rather politely) facing the apartment, even after 20+ minutes, and is reinforced by the slightest ""scary"" noise that would not normally bother him very much (e.g., a car driving by). I live in a busy area in a big city, so there is no real ""quiet"" area to take him to in order to ease him back into things.

Since the noise from lawnmowers and weed-wackers is relatively constant, working our way up to that level of stimulation would be a huge challenge, making me think there might be a more effective way.

**The current plan:**  
Assuming I can get him willing to be outside while people are doing yard work, toys, and praise along the way. (If I can't get him outside, we'll start inside with the door open and go from there.)

Does that sound like a reasonable and effective solution? Do you have any suggestions for speeding things along? I'd like to get him comfortable with the city environment as quickly as possible so that he is not terrified.

I was looking for a trainer for aggression

My vet recommended [Gigi Moss](http://www.gigimoss.com/) or [Tenderfoot Training](http://www.tenderfoottraining.com/index.html). The website you guys have (zipcode 80302 if you want my search results) recommends the Humane Society nearby as well as Tenderfoot.

When I called Tenderfoot though the guy seemed very nice but also a bit entrenched in his own ways. He referred to food training as bribery a lot which both this sub and APDT warn about. And he wanted to put my dog in an environment with cats nearly right away even though I had said he has severe cat aggression. 


**TLDR**  Basically can someone help me sift through the trainers in my area and find a couple I can call?

Quick list of the things I'm looking for

* Aggression Training

* Leash Pulling

* Off Leash attention

* Really attention in general while outside

He's great with people but if he sees any sort of animal (except birds) while outside he starts whining and trying to run toward them. With dogs he sniffs a bit then will either start playing or both dogs seem to start barking and fighting simultaneously and I don't know if it's him or the other dogs but it's violent.",self,t5_2r067,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1df39j/finding_a_trainer_or_i_searched_the_website_but/

My family and I (Fiance', 35lb, neutered and crate trained red-headed creature that lives up to his name.

A little background: Herky, he is a typical lazy, chill/relax and watch TV type of dog. We all were aware of the energy level of a terrier and thought it would be great for Herky (he needs to loose a few pounds). 

We wanted a dog to play with Herky because he is so social. Herky went to training but is still very much Bull-headed. But

I have had dogs/animals my entire life and have read/done a lot of training. I used to work with horses and now Intern at a local zoo. I do my research and reading. My fiance' expects my new dog to be a 'Herky' as he likes to say. And trust me

Now to Rowdy, stay and come. Come is getting better. His stay is really bad. He seems very ADD, but, I chalk that up to 'puppy'. He has attached himself to me. Likes everyone else but really loves me.

The issues: I have seen a VAST improvement in the walking department but we still have problems. We use a prong collar. I have used these collars on my Rottie (no longer with us) ++SEE NOTE++ and other larger dogs growing up. Now, I've tried them. And bought all of them. He had literally drug me across a football field one time. I tried the standing still, the waiting, the treats/clicker. NOTHING is working. He pulls like a sled dog. He jumps at dogs walking by. He actually jumped towards a dog and flipped over and landed on his back/head really hard the other day. His hair stands up when dogs bark at him or if he sees another dog. However, this doesn't happen at the dog park for some reason. He's very social at the dog park. He gets hump-y but other than that we have a great time there.

HE'S WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS! (Just Kidding, various area rugs, PILLOWS, shoes and a chlorinator from our pool (with chlorine in it, didn't eat it, crunched on the tablets though). He's destroyed my landscaping outback, ate a bush completely and enjoys the water from the birdbath on a regular basis.

He has toys, balls and of course, my other dog to play with. Its almost like a game. He stops when we either: A) squirt him with a squirt bottle B) Yell C) command 'drop it'/'leave it' (which works wonders now).

Family: My family is very upset with things getting chewed on. My house is a MESS ALL THE TIME! We do put stuff up but he finds a way. My fiance gave me the 'its me or the dog' speech. I talked him into another 60-90 days so I'm kind-of desperate. Its not that I'd choose the dog or anything but I think he deserves a chance. He can be a good dog

He's on Heartguard and he gets 3 Zyrtec for allergies in the AM and PM. It usually helps with the hyper-ness (unintentional

I want to help him and I want to be better for him but I'm loosing my mind. I don't think we were ready for this... BIG regrets. I know its probably us. I know I'm doing something really wrong. Or we are.

I had been on another forum and got my butt chewed for the prong collar so I've ordered a martingale collar. I've also ordered a 30ft lounge rope

I love my dog, he's 2 years old.  I sometimes have a problem with Draco, who is a 60 lb lab mix. Two things:

1. When Draco is laying down and comfortable, I have to move him.  He will sneer at me and snap at my hands when I go to physically move him.  This happens very rarely, like once a month if that.  But I've also learned if I talk nicely to him and warm him up first with ""Oh, Draco, my good boy, blah blah"" and pet him, he's less likely to snap.  But I feel lie this is....bribing him not to snap at me, I push him off the bed or couch (not aggressively

2. I want to know what you all think of this: Draco has gotten worse about resource guarding (why the change, snapping away - without warning.

The background info:
This boxer(I've decided to name him Cassius) was found near the University of California, there are a couple rips that have healed and scarred. The vet said he is around 1.5 years old and could have been a fighting dog. I guess it makes sense because of the scars but what confuses me is that so far this boy has been very obedient and whenever I say no he stops whatever he's doing. He's been around a beagle, 2 chihuahuas and another small dog with no problems at all. One of the chihuahuas actually bit him in the face and he didn't even do anything. Since Sunday night, I've been taking care of him in a new house which also has a 8month golden retriever, named Marley. There haven't been any serious incidents yet but my boxer does growl when Marley gets too close. He kinda bark/snapped at Marley as he ran past him on the stairs the other day but whenever this or the growling happened I tell him no and kinda divert his attention towards me, which so far has been working out pretty well. My friend said sometimes these dogs can be calm and just very well trained to fight on cue(which kinda scares me cause what if i accidentally give him the cue?).

Question 2) How do I train him to be more comfortable with me not around?

I've taken in Cassius since Sunday night so only about 3 days now.
Last night I left him in my room alone for 3 hours and he completely destroyed my room. My light was knocked over and shattered, after some tag I managed to get him back into the window and closed the window. I put him in a housemate's room for the time I'm gone and he said that Cassius was whining the whole time until he was let on the bed and fell asleep. I guess what I really want to know is how to keep him calm while I'm gone instead of going berserk? I've been reading that boxers don't like confinement so I was thinking of sectioning off a section of the house for him. 

TL;DR - 2 Questions 
Found a Boxer with old scars and 2 cuts that needed stitching (pictures above). So far seems pretty calm around people &amp; little dogs. Gets a bit alpha around our 8month golden retriever but stops as soon as we say no). 1) Can anyone tell if he's a fighting dog? 

Left him alone twice since I've been with him. first time he destroyed my room. second time he pushed out the screen on the window and was running around on the roof..2) How do I keep him from going nuts when I'm gone? I'm thinking of sectioning off a portion of the house for him but how do I deal with the separation anxiety?

The problem I am having is with unaltered male dogs. I try to take him and our other dog to the park 3x a week because, tail razor straight up, body really stiff, and if they move he growls and basically herds them. Lando doesn't do this to fixed males or female dogs. He doesn't outright fight or bite them, but some of the dogs don't take kindly to his antics and sometimes he will just get obsessed with cornering one dog. If the dog doesn't nip back or try to run, Lando doesn't do anything. He will just corner the dog until I call him off.  I normally am a ""let dogs work it out"" type, but obviously not all owners are comfortable with that and I don't expect them to be. Also, and I'd rather assume that every dog could hurt mine. 

So far I have worked on managing it so I can take him to the park still. Right now

1- developing a strong recall. Every time i call him to come to me, he does listen. I sometimes have to repeat myself and call him to me, but he will reluctantly leave that dog alone. 

2- developing a ""leave it"". I am working at home with his toys

3- redirect. I keep a frizbee or tug rope with me and try to make it super interesting. This works about 50% of the time. 

I guess I am looking for advice. Unlike with men

She'll nip my face or my hands or whatever she can get at, and then she whines and struggles (and bites) until I let her go again. I don't want her to think that when she can't bite a dog, she can bite a human instead, she'll associate nipping with a reward.

I've got a six month old GSD.  He is awesome!  I have been training him at home since day one

Recently, her classes are *really* laid back and easy going.  Unfortunately, both me and my dog are quite impatient, and get bored easily.  The dog seems to start acting frustrated as soon as we get there, and stresses out for most of the class when he's not ""working"".  Also, he seems to be obsessed with sniffing around the hall that the class is in, and it's very difficult to hold his attention, he knows how to heel"".  Overall

Here's my dilemma:  Despite the fact that obedience class is ""for his own good"", is there any point in going?

I feel like I've done a good job of training him at home.  I've always clicker trained him and he's a very quick learner.  Obviously, but given that he has been socialised since he was about nine weeks old, and been going to class for four/five months I'm not sure that socialising him formally every week is that important anymore.  We meet other dogs every single day on walks, and we have a dog walker that walks him with another dog for an hour, twice per week.

**I want to remove my dog from obedience class and continue training him at home

So, so I was hesitant to even go into the dog park at that point. After a few moments of calming her down though, we entered and all was well. That is, until my dog got anywhere near this Shephard dog's owners. She was highly protective of them and would chase off any dogs that got close, my dog included. Though nothing happened (my dog just ran away), I was angry at these people for bringing their obviously overprotective dog to a public park where it was not only unpredictable but they did nothing to stop the dog from acting that way either. 

I left

Tonight, the male Beagle went nuts doing the trademark howl and it set off an aggressive reaction in my dog. She growled quite ferociously and lunged at the other dog, just like the dog park incident. No biting occurred because we intervened, but it was scary since she is so big (bout 30"" tall and nearly 100lbs). 

We took them both outside on leads to let them calm down and be reintroduced, which in turn freaked him out all the more and would cause him to howl out of fear. It was a feedback loop so they had to be separated the entire time, which kind of made the night a hassle for everyone involved, making me wish I'd never brought her. :( 

I guess my question is

She is totally fine with people and new places, if the dog doesn't act scared or aggressive towards her, she is fine. We have gone to dog parks and beaches and she plays happily with the other dogs just fine. 

I am sure that her being unspayed is a contributing factor, but she wasn't in heat back when the dog park incident happened and that was neutral ground, so it makes me wonder if its more deep seeded than raging hormones.

1345709017.0,yoq07,My Mother gives in to the family dog's constant demands for table scraps. She is now severely overweight and can barely walk. Please help.,Frostfall,16,4,12,"Hello all.

First and foremost, I have decided to post here. **If this is indeed the incorrect subreddit, would someone be so kind as to direct me to one which may be able to assist me?**

My family owns a miniature schnauzer, it was not uncommon for my Mother to give her leftovers (from dinner, her lunch, whatever) to prevent her from begging for food. This has backfired terribly. Emily now barks nearly nonstop in the early morning (4:30 AM) and when my Mother returns home from work until she retires to bed for the night.

Each time she begs for food of some sort, and that it will only encourage Emily to continue to beg. I have tried reasoning with her, taking the junk food away, standing in the kitchen to make sure the dog is not fed anything other than her own food.. To no avail. All of these have led to arguments with her stating that the only issue is with how *much* table food is given to the dog, instead of whether she should be given table scraps or not. She claims it's 'just the dregs/scraps'; it's not, as she's fed large amounts of leftovers to her more than a few times. 

I am presented with two critical issues at this time. My Mother refuses to believe that any type of training will convince the dog to stop barking, but this also led to a screaming match with my Mother saying how ""unfair"" it is to be placing the dog into a separate room. 

We have taken her to a vet recently, the extra weight is certainly not helping with any of the pain that Emily is feeling. The vet warned my Mother that she should never be giving Emily table food, but did say that carrots and apples as an occasional snack are acceptable. My Mother blew this out of proportion and thinks that she can feed Emily as much junk as she wants, provided that apples and carrots are thrown into the mix.

Emily has another appointment with the vet, my Father made an attempt to address the table scraps issue with my Mother present in the room, which only led to my Mother becoming extremely angry, insisting that my Father didn't know what he was talking about, and that she would 'never give junk to the poor baby'. **I will be calling the vet today to inform them that yes, the dog is being fed excessive amounts of table food, despite what she may claim.** 

I suppose the main issue here would be.. What is the proper way to train my dog in a way that is not abusive or ""unfair""

**tl;dr: The family dog begs for table food, from barking Help!**

She has two things that need work though

1. She's become territorial as she's gotten used to us. Barking at passers by, which has helped a bit). She doesn't, however, like it when we have people over. Unless she remembers them from meeting them before (like my parents), she growls (although it sounds more like a nervous/discontent grumble), paces, her heckles come up, but she is/was great with people at the park and day care, its as if they were never inside. I don't want to correct her growl/grumble

2. She sleeps in our room with us at night (in her crate or on the floor). She's been great at coming to bed, and since we're both trying to sleep, we don't have treats etc. Eventually I get up, let her check the house, see there's nothing there, and she comes back to bed. Last night she laid down, let out a couple of little woofs and then went to sleep, I don't want to have to do that every night

Other notes: we just got a clicker

TL;DR 
1. Looking for tips on getting her to become tolerant of visitors. 
2. How to tell keep her quiet when all the lights are off and everyone is going to bed. 

Thanks in advance

4/26 **update**: We have a behaviorist coming on Saturday. A little pricey
We pushed up the urgency after watching her jump and try to nip at visitors. We have a regular houseguest (comes once/month for a couple nights usually) who has met her before. She grumbled the first time, let him pet her, would take treats etc. But she watched him in a weird way, and as soon as he got up to move, she jumped and tried to nip. We weren't fast enogh to do anything the first time, and she missed, but she tried more than once. The 2nd time, alone. A minute or so later, watching him again. He pet her, grabbed her and gave her another time out. She didn't try a 3rd time

I rent a room from my parents. They have two cockapoos who are both about seven years old now, have horrible leash manners, and their physical wellbeing is neglected. Walked maybe once or twice a week, if walked at all. Before, I could justify it by telling myself that it is their business, not mine. I take them out occasionally, practice tricks, but don't want to take the time to genuinely train them. They know how to be bribed for sit

About ten weeks ago, he is a great dog and I really do love him. Started teaching with dominance theory, a prong collar, and tried disciplining with negative and positive reinforcement. After a week, I was almost to tears because I knew it wasn't working and he was just miserable. Took me several weeks before I realized how broken dominance theory is and how ineffective negative responses were for a puppy (I feel rather dumb), but was having trouble finding a good source to draw from. Finally found you guys, and he is doing 200% better.

In the past 10 weeks since I got him (now 21 weeks old), speak, is still learning bite inhibition, and knows to bark to be let out to go potty. He is getting the hang of being on a lead, learning stay and not to chew on the furniture, and I am trying to figure out heel. He has loads of toys, and between the couple of ropes, balls

The first problem is that there are three poorly trained dogs who are teaching him some very, and even though it hasn't been an issue with other owners, it definitely will be), the dogs bark at everything that passes the house (which he is happily following along with), bad leash manners, begging, and that its okay to just ignore commands.My parents have absolutely no interest in regular exercise or enforcing any rules, my parents will let him out while I'm at work and for one dog to be kenneled while the other three aren't feels like torture. I've insisted and begged that they train their dogs, and that just feeding them and letting them sleep in your bed is enough. But the fact is they have better homes than the animal shelter would give them

Something I've noticed is that for the majority of commands she's visual based and not sound based. What I mean is I can say any word I want or not even say anything and give a hand signal or facial expression to get my pup to perform one of her tricks. The two exceptions so far are sit and come here. I know I need to add and reinforce stay

Outside of the basics such as ""sit/stay/drop it/leave it/come here"" are there any other commands that should be based upon words primarily? Her name is a given as well to be able to gain focus of course. But is it in best practice to transition towards just the word command or is being able to just raise my eyebrows and mouth the word woof to get her to speak enough?

I got my Aussie two weeks ago from a local breeder. When I brought him home he was acting very lethargic and whenever I tried to pet him he would get up and move to another spot. I thought it was just separation anxiety due to being away from his litter mates and mother. Well, I took my dog to the vet and he had coccidia and tapeworms. He has now been given a clean bill of health from my vet! Yay.
 
The problem:
He still doesn't seem to want to listen to me, giving him treats, and playing. I make sure to never yell at him either because I read in a book I bought on Aussie how sensitive they can be. He is also extremely nippy and has actually broken the skin while playing and it makes me scared he might be showing signs of aggression. I've tried ignoring, a firm ""No."", gentling holding his mouth shut, yelping like an injured puppy then ignoring until he calms down, and redirecting but he keeps coming at me and seems to be more excited by it.  I take him outside to pee once every hour and for short walks in the early morning and late evening before it gets to hot. The only time I can get him to pay attention to me is when I'm trying to get him to learn tricks. He has also learned sit, roll over

Is my dog still sick?
Am I doing too much or not enough?
Is this normal or do I just have an antisocial/aggressive puppy? 
Could it be because of the trauma of being sick?
Am I doing to much with the little guy?

However, and whines. For HOURS. She constantly follows me around the apartment and even whines when I close the door to go to the bathroom. What's worse is she does this even when my roommates are there. The only person she doesn't mind being left alone with is my boyfriend. My roommates can't close the door and go to sleep if I am at work late. One time she got so upset she chewed the door trim all up when my roommate left. She has NEVER been destructive. I feel like she is a different dog when she is at my apartment. 

Luckily the roommates have been gone for most of summer, as well as mine. 

I feel like a big part of the problem is at home we had another dog, but there isn't much I can do. He is my brother's dog and he took him to college.

I asked the vet on how to help and she suggested giving her a treat every time I leave and a few other tips. I try not to be overly excited when I get home and take her on long walks to tire her out. She said as a last resort to use a shock collar

I am sorry for the long post, but would that be an option? Other than this issue, she is a really great dog. I absolutely love her to death!

[Sitting on Toby

[Very much a sweetheart](http://i.imgur.com/Zid90Vq)

[One more for luck](http://i.imgur.com/uzSaVm5)

My boyfriend and I brought home a new rescue dog (11 months old, is eating well, has only had one housebreaking accident, and is responding well to her clicker training (she's already picked up 'sit', 'down', and 'stay' and is now working on 'come' and her leash manners). She's normally very loving and people-friendly.

Two days ago, from newly introduced toys to the very first toy we gave her. It's not consistent, but often when she's playing with one of her toys, she'll bare her teeth and snarl at me. What's particularly confusing is that she sometimes approaches me first, cuddles up, and then begins snarling. Last night, she grabbed her Busy Bee, and then started snarling and snapped out to try to bite me. 

I've researched resource guarding and have started trying to use treats to train her to associate my approach toward her toy with a pleasant reward. However

The most befuddling part for me is that she has, and not toward my boyfriend. This is confusing, and though I'm trying to be rational and understanding, a bit disheartening. I provide most of her care (I feed her, give her water, take her on her morning run, take her outside to use the bathroom, takes her on walks, or is it something else entirely?

I welcome all suggestions and very much appreciate your help!

She stays put and even tries to run the opposite direction of where we're going.

I mostly need to vent because yesterday was pretty stressful and I'm not sure how to proceed as a responsible owner. FYI

My dog, my fiance said that at the dog park she grabbed a rat terrier *by the neck* and shook it like a tug toy. This really bothers me. Nobody was hurt, the owner was very apologetic because she had her small dog in the big dog area and there were other dogs there harassing it before my dog decided to join in. However, I feel terrible about it and I'm at a loss about how to interpret Gypsy's behavior. She has also been really barky at other dogs when we walk downtown and it's embarrassing as hell. People are afraid of her because she's so big, even though she's never hurt anybody and is not human-aggressive at all.

The thing is

1. See other dog. Ears and tail erect

2. Start pulling/lunging to get at the other dog. Lots of calming signals. If I get within 15-20 ft and restrain her

3. She has also run into other dogs when she is on-leash and the other dog is off-leash (not something I can control, is standing as tall as possible, tail and ears up, and is ""looking down"" at the other dog with closed mouth while circling them and trying to investigate. This applies to dogs of any size. 

4. She usually then initiates play

At the dog park, and start circling them. Then she will either leave them alone or play chase with them. She  *does not* like it when other dogs try to sniff her butt. She spins like a top trying to avoid it, tail tucked and ears down. But other than the incident yesterday, she hasn't been mouthy with other dogs. She will also ""stalk"" other dogs, staring at them and walking towards them in a crouching position.

My fiance and I are trying to decide what her interactions with other dogs should consist of at this point. It is not possible to isolate her completely because we live in a town where dogs are everywhere: some people let their dogs run free, and of course the parks are crowded. I usually walk her at times when it's quiet so that her daily exercise isn't too stressful, but there are always dogs barking at her from behind barriers. For on-leash scenarios, we are trying BAT and ""watch me"" and will keep working on raising her threshold, but it's an uphill battle.

Should I let her keep socializing off-leash at the park and on hikes, she tries to chase it. While we work on her reactivity issues on-leash, is it beneficial for her to spend time learning appropriate greeting and play behavior from other dogs, or is that actually making things worse?

TL;DR BREGO LOVES THE TRAILER

I took I_am_quite_nervous advice and brought the trailer in the house. I asked him nicely to go in it. (this took a moment of coaching( once he was in I gave him a few pets and his food. We did this for the next few days  when we were eating or relaxing. This was his ""safe"" zone. If he jumped out we would let him stay out for a bit them ask him to go back in. After a day of doing this he would fall asleep in it. Then I closed ( I did not zipper it yet) the flap. Once he was ok with that then I closed it half way so he could still get out. After a few hours of doing that I closed it all the way and only allowed him to come out when he was asked. We did this for 3 days and finally today we took him out for a 20 min ride. My boy friend first towed it around just to get the feeling of it so the first run with it on was not a disaster ( you never know). After that we called him in and waited a bit till he was ok with it. We went a few feet ( Me along beside him on the bike) stopped and praised him. After a while he was liking it so we went to the store and back!

At 12 weeks old do we start to stretch the breaks from one hour? For example, 80 minutes until week 14)? Or is that too gradual? Or is there a certain point where they just ""get it"" and don't need a break?

I read that around 12 weeks they develop enough muscle control to hold it. Not sure if that means things change quickly

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

I've grown up with dogs. I have a way with domestic and farm animals that none of my friends can describe. I just seem to know what they're thinking or what they need by looking at them

I'm training my dogs to jog with me so I can take them on my route or to the mountains like I used to. I stopped taking them to the mountains because they had developed a preemptive strike pack mentality. You can imagine how that goes over with other dog owners on the trails. 

I've got two English Springer Spaniels. The older one, I speak her name and slowly turn and head the other direction. She catches on pretty quickly that we go where I dictate and not to get over-excited. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

**The Problem**: 

My 3 y/o, but when I try to pick up the pace and run alongside her, she gets scared. She ducks her little tail for a second, goes prone, lowers her head and looks up at me with big scared puppy eyes.

When she sees that I see that she has stopped, she's just nervous.

I've only taken her on one walk recently (last Tuesday). I don't want her paws getting sore before they can develop callouses. After 10 minutes on our street of trying to persuade her, she decided she wanted to go home. I wasn't done yet, but this was clearly something that wouldn't be resolved with a single walk. 

She could still see home, set her down, let her calm down and eventually we moved on. She wasn't quite so homesick at this point, so we started walking and I tried to bring it to a jog again. *BAM* She lays down. (She's dreaming and kicking her paws as I type this lol) 

I figured she had been in the heat long enough for the first time, ""You wanna go home?"" and she started walking. 

On the way home, she would notice me running and stop, then I would stop and avoid eye contact, just looking ahead of us. She would start to jog again.

I know I can train her not to be scared of me while running, a more comfortable way for her.

**Problem One- Potty Training** 

I work with her day and night. I reward her for good behavior and scold her when I see her have an accident, but she understood. 

**Problem Two- Biting and Jumping**

This is driving me NUTS. Constantly jumping. You'd think that she walks on two legs because she spends so much time on them. I try the sharp ""no"" and yipping, feet, arms, and especially your toes. I can't get it out of her. I'm constantly screaming. The neighbors must think I'm nuts. NONE of my dogs have ever done it to that extent. She's extremely playful, but she doesn't know how to be gentle. My big pit will bite her back gently and try to teach her, but even her doggy mentor isn't able to tame her. 

**Problem 3- Overly Assertive**

She is not aggressive, she'll complain (which is actually a little adorable). But she never lets up. She always wants her way. The few times that I've so mad that I gave her a hard tap, nothing hurtful, she did NOT like it and let me know.

**Conclusion**

She's not aggressive. She's very dog friendly and LOVES people, I know, but it's paid off in that she doesn't mind at all when you touch her face while she's eating. She'll sit on your lap for hours, but she will never ever EVER do anything she doesn't want to do. I don't think I'm prepared for this. I've never had a true pit, which she is or is very close to. Maybe this assertiveness is common. I think her behavior might have been caused by a lack of play time with her litter mates, since she didn't have such a good start.

1.) She knows sit. That was pretty easy and she got it around 5 weeks. Now she is starting to jump up while sitting. What do I do in this situation

2.) She is still not feeling the leash. But

3.) She's been introduced to at least 30-40 people at this point. My fear is that when they go up to her sometimes they'll go for a squat and shell jump up to lick their face

4.) Whenever she whines and has her paw up on my bed I ignore her completely. Is this what I should be doing? She is only allowed up if I pat the bed and say come and lift her up. My bed is really low btw so she'll be able to jump right on in a week or so

What else should I be doing?


As a side note I'm also curious as to what everyone thinks she may be mixed with. She has 4 brothers, husky and in my opinion border collie. Her coat is short but she has these weird hairs that stick up on her face somewhat like a terrier. Also she is a buff color but has white paws. The brothers are all white-yellow lab coloring.

She has a 12 year old dog, which she knows is a sign of being willing to submit, but her older dog never dominates him. The puppy (who is fairly large - around 50 lbs) starts barking at Bear (the older dog) and Bear will growl and nip at him which sometimes causes a fight.

He isn't trained, he chews, etc.) and has also bitten her (she says he's not aggressive, though, just spooks easily) but she knows this will take training. Right now, she's mostly concerned with he and her older dog not getting along. She is this dog's only chance, and could use any tips/advice anyone may have.

Note: She was lead to believe this dog was more trained than he is by the shelter, but she's not sure what to do as she thought this dog would be a better fit for her family than he is.

First of all

Anyway, and she is overall a very sweet and well-behaved dog. However, she is very reactive to noises outside our place (we live in a townhouse complex that is largely pretty quiet). Sometimes the slightest noises will get her attention immediately and make her stare at the noise and begin growling and barking. Even ice moving around in the fridge gets her on the defensive. For some reason, kids making noise seems to be the worst (I'm dreading summertime the way things are right now).

I have tried telling her ""quiet"" firmly and then praising / rewarding when she stays quiet for a few moments. I have tried distracting her with toys / treats / etc, etc. I have also (I'll admit, somewhat angrily) sent her upstairs to her kennel and kept her there for a few minutes to cool down.

While these have varying degrees of success in the moment, but it's very frustrating especially because she is otherwise very quiet and well-behaved.

Our Backstory:
We've fostered a few dogs over the years but could use some help here. We have a 6 year old GSD/Lab mix that is the Alpha Female of the neighborhood. Our house has 8 foot fences

His Backstory:
He was a stray in Los Angeles that was rescued and brought up to Seattle by a local shelter. He's been in a kennel/boarding with over 20 other dogs for the past 3 weeks. He's 4 years old and weighs 120lbs. He knows zero commands that we can find. His temperament is amazing. He does not have the typical GSD anxieties and gets along well with dogs of all types and sizes. He could care less about cats and is basically a big gentle giant which is what we were looking for.

Today is Day One. 

I literally just brought him home a few hours ago. 

At the kennel he showed signs of separation anxiety and is currently walking the perimeter of the house getting used to his new home. I hand fed him after giving him a tour and he's currently laying at my feet next to our other dog. 

What I'd like help with is:

-What are some tips or recommendations for helping him ease into our home?

-We have no idea what his name is and he knows no commands. I tried English/Spanish/German/French/Hand/Whistle all with no effect. Any tips for helping us get started with an untrained massive animal?

-He was ok on the car ride but couldn't hold still. I believe this is largely due to the amount of places he's been to over the past few weeks and never had any stability.

-Treats: He may just be super high strung but I've tried Peanut Butter and our normal PB/Jerky treats we use for our other dog. He doesn't seem to be food motivated yet so I'm going to give him a few days before trying out a few different treats.

-I bought him a service dog type vest with ""In training"" tags. He seems to like it and it makes moving this horse sized animal a lot easier.

-He's wearing a pheromone collar based on the recommendation from a local trainer. Since this is day one

I adopted a [shepherd mix](http://i.imgur.com/rJZUM.jpg) (who may actually be full malinois and not a mix) when she was 8 weeks old (she's now 6 months). When we met her in the shelter she was very calm and relaxed. She walked up to greet us and let us touch her when we called

As she settled in, but I can deal with that. The thing I am most worried about is her suspicious nature. I have been socializing her since the week after we brought her home (about 9 weeks). Here's some of the regular activities we do with her to socialize her:

* she's been through 11 weeks of puppy classes so far with other puppies around her age (she's a star at obedience and is the best in the class)

* she's a regular at the dog park near our house

* she's been to dog-friendly restaurants with outside seating about 6-7 times with us.

* she goes to our local dog supply stores with us

* she's been to my work a few times and met my coworkers

* she goes on daily neighborhood walks

Even so, but if they reach down to pet her it is usually met with a low growl (no snarl or ears back though). At the dog park, she is better, and will go up and sniff people, but she retreats if they try to touch her. She is much worse on her own territory, and very leash reactive. She will bark at anyone who walks past my house when she's outside, and will get very excited and try to bark/pull towards people on walks around the neighborhood. I'm afraid my neighbors are going to get terrified of her because they don't understand it is from being frightened and not aggression. 

I've been working with her on the leash reactivity daily

Our seven month old puggle, excited, or nervous) and is starting to grow out of some of her puppyhood mischief-making.  Last week I wanted to see how she would act if let into the bedroom, an area of the house off limits prior.

Well, socks, pillows, you name it.  Even after I cleaned everything up, she was discovering articles of clothing and other more dangerous things (fiancee's hair ties and bobby pins) that I hadn't even noticed were there.

Finally I had cleaned everything.  At this point she started whining at the hamper, ending with her peeing on the floor (something she hadn't done in at least three weeks).  Needless to say, I was all sorts of frustrated and distraught.  It's been five months that I haven't been able to use my computer while she is awake, because it is in the bedroom.  I was kind of hoping to have that luxury back.

How do I get her to act properly in the bedroom? I tried getting her to sit or lie down and give her treats the longer she stays in that position,False,self,t5_2r067,False,,,t3_13wjcg

Last week at 2 am someone attempted to break into our flat and Jinx went nuts- barking, etc. He effectively scared them off, but has been generally more anxious, less settled, and more reactive since then. I've been working with him and he's again fairly relaxed and not very reactive while inside. He's also happy to go into his crate and sleep while I'll home and is completely quiet. I found out today that he's been barking when home alone. Apparently it's not very much, but when someone enters or leaves the building, or he hears noise, quiet and secure while home alone.

So I've had this dog since she was a puppy. She was separated from her mom too young and the man who gave her to me failed to mention she was extremely sick. In fact

So during her first few weeks of life she was carted around from hospital to hospital. The only thing that was constant was my presence. I stayed with her till the vet closed. Took time off work and school to be with her while she was sick.

So I understand that she's attached to me

I'll often be doing something like studying, she comes back and sits right under the table (she's too big to fit, so you can tell she's uncomfy, but she keeps coming back).

If she's asleep and I get up to go use the toilet, she will wake up and stare. She only sleeps when I leave the house, or when I sleep.

She *always* wants to be in bed with me. Even though I kick in my sleep and often kick her accidentally. I feel bad for doing it so I remedy this by having her sleep away from my legs.

She doesn't have the classic symptoms of Separation Anxiety. She never barks or cries when I go to work or school. She doesn't destroy things or urinate/defecate in the house.

My bedroom is tiny but she will not go play out in the living room unless I relocate there myself.

So how do I inspire her to be more independent and not hover around me constantly?

At this point

I should add that I'm pretty sure there is something wrong with him mentally/socially, even for a dog. He doesn't understand simple things that my previous dogs got easily. He doesn't get normal doggy social cues. 

Anyway
He used to have no problem going in his kennel before I left. Now when I stand by it he'll go to the door with his tail between his legs. It takes several calls for him to come back, just with me leaving.

Since we live in a small apartment, but also at people sometimes. He's never aggressive about it, but he seems to think he HAS to bark to play with them. His bark is really loud, and it really is just CONTINUOUS. It's so annoying and disruptive and I always feel bad that I can't control him, but he HAS to be able to run around somewhere. 
Sometimes he fixates on a dog that doesn't want to play with him. There are 20 other dogs to play with, they get mad at him. And he doesn't seem to understand that they are mad at him. So the other dog ends up snarling and snapping at him, and the dog's owner gets upset. Even if I drag him away and hold him back for a while or try to get him to play with other dogs, he'll make a beeline back to the first dog as soon as he can. 
I can't get to him in time to correct him while we're there because the park is big and he's too fast. He completely ignores me while we're there

He also chews on everything. I make sure he always has toys to chew on: he has a Kong, and bones. He shreds all of those but the Kong, but still chews on just about anything else. 
He chews on the usual clothes and shoe targets, though), pens, books, bags, and all kinds of plastic things. Yesterday he managed to chew half of the drawstring off a hoodie that was hanging up without damaging the rest of it. I've even caught him chewing on the corners of walls, tables
The most worrying thing was the other day
He's very sneaky while he does all of this. He doesn't make a sound. 
And for some reason, or even when I'm on the computer. I've started trying to put him in his kennel while I take a shower or nap, but he's already in his kennel while I'm gone most of the day so I don't really want to do that.
Aside from all the time, I'm also afraid he will chew on a wire or get a hold of something that will really hurt him. 


Sorry for the long post but I am just about at the end of what I can handle on my own here. Please share anything you think may help.


**TL;DR:** My main problems are these: 

* He has major separation anxiety. 

* He chews up anything and everything

* He will not shut up if there is another dog anywhere nearby

* He doesn't behave very well around dogs and he doesn't respond much to normal doggy social cues (like the other dog telling him ""that's enough"" or ""let's play"" or ""stop that"" or even ""back the fuck up or I'll bite you"").

1349648466.0,113v18,Fearful dog being shouted at -- how to approach owners?,surf_wax,15,4,4,"This is more a question about humans than dogs.

I live downstairs from my (female) landlord and her 10-year-old son in a separate apartment.  A year or so ago, she got a Chihuahua from the local shelter.

The boyfriend didn't want a dog.  He told me this before they got it, I fucking listened to him and didn't say anything.  So a few days after I hear this, they bring home a freshly-neutered adult Chihuahua, the kid's in love, everything's great.

Except it's not.  The boyfriend was unemployed at the time and wound up being the person staying at home with the dog.  And based on the dog's behavior, but it will also yelp in terror, refuses to allow him to walk it unless the landlord or her son is there, cowers, etc.  The boyfriend is apparently hurt that the dog doesn't like him, and doesn't seem to understand that's it's a dog, its brain is the size of a walnut, it's not personal.  He leans over and picks it up

I am sitting down here listening to the dog yelping, but at this point, does it matter?  It's abuse either way.

I don't know what to do.  Clearly it was a bad idea for them to get this dog, though I wouldn't cry if he did, not at this point.  Next time I hear it I'm going to ask him to send the dog outside so I can let it in and it can hang with me for awhile, but this isn't a good solution long-term; it doesn't solve the problem, and I'm going to be getting my own dog in January or February, so the last thing I need is a territorial Chihuahua randomly visiting my house.  I can talk to them about fear response, incentive-based training, give them my copy of Don't Shoot the Dog

How the hell do I approach this with these people?  The landlord is reasonable.  I've talked to her about this before, it would be one thing, but even though I'm comfortable with her, I feel like I have to tread lightly.

tl;dr - Listening to animal being abused by landlord's SO

UPDATE:  I got a quote from a local dog trainer, and I don't think the boyfriend knew.  I woke up to yelping, stomping directly over my bedroom, big-angry-guy shouting, and after I recorded some of it, I texted him and told him to let the dog out so I could watch him until my landlord got home.  No answer, so I texted her, and I didn't answer.  I was pretty angry.  Now my landlord and I are emailing back and forth
