Knock off the ignorant attacking of posters who put up photos of artifacts they found.",deaconblues99,254,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/174a3l/getting_along_with_the_public_is_a_big_part_of/

1) OP posts picture of artifact he/she (or a relative) found in a plowed field

2) A stream of posters flood into the thread to tell the OP that he/she is going to hell for picking up / having that artifact

Let's get this out there right now: **many of you seem to be unaware of what ""context"" really means in archaeology.**

*Primary context* refers to the position of an artifact (or artifacts) in the presumed undisturbed position in which they were deposited by the people who used them.  Artifacts in primary context provide the maximum amount of information about the people who made and used them

*Secondary context* (which also may be disturbed but otherwise in situ) means that an artifact is no longer in primary context.  It may have been dug up and redeposited prehistorically (which is actually closer to primary context in many ways)

Artifacts in secondary context vary wildly in their usefulness, and (if they're diagnostic) they can give us a clue as to the age of that site.  But they're less useful outside of a GPS coordinate, and even that is questionable.  Most archaeologists are not interested in plotting the locations of individual artifacts.

*Tertiary context* is a term I've not seen used much, or artifacts inherited from a grandparent and kept in a shoebox for 50 years.

Artifacts in tertiary context provide almost **NO** significant information to archaeologists and are nearly negligible in their value in terms of understanding the past.  We don't care if someone picked up an arrowhead from a streambed or gravel bar.  That artifact could have come from directly up the bank

When you guys come in here guns blazing and fired up on holier-than-thou Intro to Archaeology rhetoric

**You're poisoning the well.**

These people come in here because they're interested in archaeology.  They want to share something they found (that they think is cool) with what they assume to be a friendly and knowledgeable group.  And instead they get lectured

You don't know what these folks do in their real lives.  They may be multi-millionaires who would like to meet archaeologists because they want to get involved and even fund projects.  I personally know people like that.  My friend was a collector (might even at one time have been a straight-up looter)

And he's offered to fund more projects just because he's interested in the work and likes the people involved.

I wonder... if he'd been shunned by the archaeological community when he first got involved

Many of the people you hassle on here will likely not talk to an archaeologist again, far from the truth.

We rely on the public for funding

When you morality brigade guys go off on artifact posters

The person who posted the picture of the point next to the quarter?  She mentioned in one of her posts that she's a lawyer.  More than that, or even to increase funding for cultural resource management.  And she will now remember that the time she posted a picture of an artifact she found, a bunch of assholes called her a looter and told her she was a liar.*  And she might vote against the law because of that.

Think about what you say on here.  Stop calling people looters for picking up artifacts, or telling people they did a bad thing.

Knock. It. Off.

'alternative theories'",15,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/rk58w/mod_note_on_rarchaeology_antiintellectualism_and/,"Let me be clear that this statement is based on my experience as a qualified Egyptian archaeologist who has worked with very prominent names in the field of Egyptology, Hittitology, Sumerology, but if it is not

For laymen - people who do not study actively and within a traditional post-graduate framework - it is easy to be misled by all the competative theories and suggestions available through The History Network, which are driven by marketing to the masses. This includes a great deal of sensationalism. ""Ancient Aliens"" has had four successful seasons on The History Channel, all of which should be viewed if only for hilarity.

For those of us in the field, studied enough to garner a fuller understanding of the language, culture, and history of the Ancients. It is therefore saddening for me to see any number of subscribers here suggesting that the academic world is purposefully ignoring ideas put forth that may have a kernel of truth - we do not do this. We do not ignore, we rule out.

Archaeologists are not part of a vast conspiracy to deny the possibility of the truth in order to promote our own theories. We do promote our own theories, or ridiculous. We disagree on many things, and sometimes quite vocally. For example, when I studied Middle Egyptian, three tenured faculty members disagreed as to whether certain tenses even existed; there was discord even on that minute level. At conferences, we listen to each other and then hastily come up with retorts and counter-examples - it is our job to tear each other down if it helps us get to the truth of history.

I am very upset to see any anti-intellectualism in this subreddit. We are here to help, it is because there is not enough context, not enough  evidence that can be applied to the breadth of knowledge we already have of that time, of that place, or of that people. While there may be areas of our field that are unexplained, we do not write them off as unexplainable, neither will we accept the first explanation someone puts forth. If we don't know exactly how the pyramids were built (a longtime bone of contention between some archaeologists)

I apologize for rambling on

So, that would explain context and its importance and why just digging things up with a shovel is bad.

You're walking around with a metal detector, but you've destroyed and lost any information around it, including soil layers (which are incredibly informative!) and any other delicate non-metal evidence that might have been around there. What if the coins had been under a wooden floor that had rotted away? What if they were sitting on top of a surface that was once a dirt floor? What if they had been wrapped in delicate cloth remains? What if they were in a posthole? You have the dates on the coins, but do you have a date for the soil level they were in? Do you know how or when the coins got there? All of that information is now lost and destroyed.


""Proper"" excavations are usually done in a way that finds artifacts but also gathers as much other information as possible. If you think you have an artifact underground, or like 1x2 feet if you're digging by yourself. First you carefully slice off the sod/grass layer, and then you start very slowly digging down with a trowel by scraping off dirt centimeters at a time. This allows you to watch and note any changes in the soil, look at how artifacts are arranged relative to each other, etc. For example, if you find coins from the 1700s in a soil layer that also has some artifacts that can be easily dated to, say, that's very interesting! Why did someone have such old coins in the 1960s and how did they end up here? Soil is much more varied and informative than you might think - what if those coins were in a little section of dirt that was a completely different texture and color of dirt than the dirt all around it? That might imply that someone dug up a hole and then reburied the coins intentionally - also very interesting and important information! But now we will never know - all of that information is lost when people excavate like treasure hunters. 

Archaeologists keep very careful notes that include not only the locations of artifacts, diagrams of soil stratigraphy, and in general just obnoxiously detailed notes about literally everything they touched or saw or did every day of an excavation. This is because once you dig something up, you can never put it back in exactly the same place or put the dirt back or regain any information that you missed. Being very careful and recording all information, *whether it seems useful at the time or not*, means that in the future another archaeologist can go back and look at your notes and make new conclusions or notice things that you didn't.  No one is trying to be snooty - it just makes us very sad and frustrated to hear about information being lost and destroyed like that.

Archaeologists love learning about old dead people's stuff and we love telling the public about that stuff. Often (and I mean OFFFFTEN) people bring us some of their old stuff and we are asked ""What is this? What does it do? Where did it come from?"" which is ok. We like talking to you about things you are passionate about because we are as well. However it is important for that public to know (or for young archaeologists to be able to explain to them) what we can and cannot tell them and **WHY** (Protip: Never EVER tell someone with an artifact ""NO"" and walk away. They are obviously not archaeologists

Here's an example before we get down and dirty (pun intended). Medical doctors (because some of us here are just ""normal"" doctors) can't just tell anyone private information about their patients anytime or anywhere they want--they swore an oath to ""Do No Harm""

We understand that the resource that we protect are meant to inform and help all of humanity, while that middle-man flips it for thousands or millions of dollars--we want that poor farmer to be able to better support their family (gogo public/local archaeology!) without having to do that. I would rather see people eat and have shelter from selling artifacts than not, but I would ultimately like to enhance their situations to where that isn't even an option. See, it's a complicated subject, but hopefully I can help make it a little clearer. 

So

* The Society for American Archaeology's (SAA) [""*Principles of Archaeological ethics"" ](http://www.saa.org/AbouttheSociety/PrinciplesofArchaeologicalEthics/tabid/203/Default.aspx) 

&gt; Principle No. 3:

Commercialization

The Society for American Archaeology has long recognized that the buying and selling of objects out of archaeological context is contributing to the destruction of the archaeological record on the American continents and around the world. The commercialization of archaeological objects - their use as commodities to be exploited for personal enjoyment or profit - results in the destruction of archaeological sites and of contextual information that is essential to understanding the archaeological record. Archaeologists should therefore **carefully weigh the benefits to scholarship of a project against the costs of potentially enhancing the commercial value of archaeological objects. Whenever possible they should discourage, especially objects that are not curated in public institutions, or readily available for scientific study, public interpretation, and display.** 


* Archaeological Institute of America [(AIA)*""Code of Professional Standards""*](http://www.archaeological.org/news/advocacy/132)  [AIA Code of Ethics](http://www.archaeological.org/pdfs/AIA_Code_of_EthicsA5S.pdf)

&gt; 2. Refuse to participate in the trade of undocumented antiquities and refrain from activities that enhance the commercial value of such objects. Undocumented antiquities are those which are not documented as belonging to a public or private collection before December 30th, or which have not been excavated and exported from the country of origin in accordance with the laws of that country; 
3. Inform appropriate authorities of threats to


* The American Anthropological Association [(AAA)'s Code of Ethics.](http://www.aaanet.org/issues/policy-advocacy/upload/AAA-Ethics-Code-2009.pdf)(pdf)

&gt; C. Responsibility to the public: 
* 1. Anthropological researchers should make the results of their research appropriately available to sponsors, and other nonanthropologists. In so doing, **they must be 
truthful; they are not only responsible for the factual content of their statements but also must consider carefully the social and political implications of the information they disseminate. They must do everything in their power to insure that such information is well understood, be candid about their qualifications and philosophical or political biases, and recognize and make clear the limits of anthropological expertise. At the same time, they must be alert to possible harm their information may cause people with whom they work or colleagues.  
* 2. In relation with his or her own government, an anthropologist should be honest and candid.  **Anthropologists must not compromise their professional responsibilities and ethics and should not agree to conditions which inappropriately change the purpose, focus or intended outcomes of their research.** 
* 3. Anthropologists may choose to move beyond disseminating research results to a position of advocacy. This is an individual decision


* Register of Professional Archaeologists [(RPA) *""Code of Conduct""*](http://www.rpanet.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=3) 

&gt; The Archaeologist's Responsibility to the Public
1.1 An archaeologist shall:

* Recognize a commitment to represent Archaeology and its research results to the public in a responsible manner;
* Actively support conservation of the archaeological resource base;
* Be sensitive to
* **Avoid and discourage exaggerated
* Support and comply with the terms of the UNESCO Convention on the means of prohibiting and preventing the illicit import, as adopted by the General Conference, 14 November 1970, Paris.
1.2 An archaeologist shall not:

* Engage in any illegal or unethical conduct involving archaeological matters or knowingly permit the use of his/her name in support of any illegal or unethical activity involving archaeological matters;
* Give a professional opinion
* Engage in conduct involving dishonesty
* Undertake any research that affects the archaeological resource base for which she/he is not qualified.
* Knowingly be involved in the recovery or excavation of artifacts for commercial exploitation


Hey


So here's the deal: we like to talk to you about your artifact and we thank you for bringing it to our attention, which is pretty mean. People don't buy artifacts--they buy the history and the story. Archaeologists have provlidged knowledge about a great many artifacts, but we want to use our powers for good, not evil. We also get really REALLY mad when other archaeologists do this (we totally blacklist them--try getting a job after that). Ultimately it's up to the individual archaeologist say and do whatever they want, but appropriate consequences come with those actions. I can honestly say that I've had to turn down many potential jobs and projects because these considerations were not made or there may have been some ""morally gray areas"" to navigate, and I remain to this day a ""squeeky clean"" archaeologist. Everything is built on our reputations--to our peers, colleagues, the public. 

We are the stewards of our collective past and have trained very hard for a very long time (and at a significant cost to our livers and loved ones) to be the best at doing it so that everyone can enjoy our history.
