Personally i am super excited for the update and would like it released now. I came to terms a long time ago that Terraria was dead and for $10 or $2.50 it was well worth it. I didn't expect a 1.2 update.

Now with 1.2 close to launch Its ok to be excited but we need to Show Red more support instead of complaining that he is taking to long on this update and worried about quantity over quality. As far as i can remember there hasn't been game breaking bugs from any update. So let Red add what he wants. He is doing all this for us and himself

You got your monies worth. So Everyone just calm down and wait. It will be here when Red releases 1.2. Downvote me i don't care

Red if you read this Keep up the great work and hope 1.2 is what we all have dreamed of as i know it will blow our socks off just from spoilers.

* Terraria was developed by one person, and Tiy for some of the later sprite work) but all of the coding came from Redigit.

* Terraria was released earlier than planned because a leaked copy got out

* Redigit eventually halted continued development on Terraria. His main reason given was he wanted to be there for his newborn child

* Around that time, Starbound takes it in a very different direction with multiple races, spaceships, planets, etc. Release date TBA.

* In September of 2012 Redigit signed a deal with 505 games for them to port Terraria over to consoles and add new content ([Source](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=399999856732587&amp;set=a.400043270061579.90569.149488785117030&amp;type=1)). Under the contract however they have no power over the PC version

* Early February of 2013 Redigit began to drop hints that he was again working on content updates for the PC version of Terraria. After some teasing he stated in a tweet that yes a PC update is coming

* Redigit has no solid estimate on when the update will hit

* The console version is currently **confirmed** to be released March 26th 2013 for PS3

Fishbowl helmet, normally, is bad, right? Completely stupid, even! Who in their right mind would want to drown while on dry land!?...Read on, skeptics.  

One of the end game items you can acquire is Neptune's Shell. Whenever you go into water you turn into a merperson (mermaid, the ability to swim as if you had flippers, and freedom of movement underwater as if you were walking on dry land (even hermes boots work!).  

Now

What does this mean

Therefore, and you must always have a neptune's shell in your inventory.  

Your goal on this new map is to survive and thrive, but, death means losing that end game item, and most people might get kind of angry about that. But, I'm assuming if you're doing this challenge, it means you've beaten everything in hard mode and you're kind of getting bored with regular playthrough styles. I won't enforce it as a rule for this challenge, but if you want it to be extra hard

I would say that you should start the challenge with a brand new character, so that you have to fully begin the game again as a fish man. I will also say that it's okay to use your high level toon to reforge the neptune's shell until it gives you a decent bonus. Because, with that fishbowl on your head, you will never be able to have a full set bonus from armor (which I think is going to make this challenge ever harder).  

**TL;DR Challenge Summary:**   
You must always have the Fish Bowl on your helmet slot
New Map
Reforging the Neptune's Shell with your main character is allowed
The only help you are allowed is from other fish people
No Breathing Reed allowed to counteract the fishbowl helmet. That's bad
Water Breathing potions are allowed
NPCs are also allowed. The real challenge will be finding a way for them to survive in a place that you can

**Optional goals/challenges:**    
Your hatred of mankind is insatiable! Teach those filthy mouthbreathers a lesson and flood the world! I'a Cthulhu!!  
Make it to the ocean
The only food Merfolk eat is Goldfish. Potions are allowed
Find the wizard NPC and free him from his bindings. In his gratitude



There you have it, but I think this is a pretty good start.  

(edit)  

Top of the subreddit, I'm glad you all like the idea!  

After I made this thread, I think we should just proclaim they are the king of Terraria.

I've logged 85 hours in a game that I paid $5 on a steam sale for.  That works out to about 6 cents PER HOUR. Nothing in this world is that cheap

I was absolutely blown away by the hardmode update - I have never in my life seen so much content just given away for free.  I was grateful to have it... felt guilty, feel *entitled* to this content, which seems to be the unfortunate sentiment on TerraReddit.

My point is this; the developers want to move on and create new games.  This is awesome news for all of us.  We get new stuff to play! Perhaps in 6 months their attention will return again to Terraria and we'll get another update.

If they do, which is removing part of the finished game prior to release for sale later.

**How?**

On Linux systems, TF2, Guild Wars, CS:S, Civilization V, Starcraft II, Skyrim and many others. Yes, a brand-new game

To determine if a Windows application can run on Windows or not, community oriented database of test results, bug reports and solutions to common problems. 

Terraria has currently a [Gold](http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&amp;iId=23556) rating on the AppDB. This means not that the game can run easily on Linux, even a correct installation of Terraria on Linux doesn't support Multiplayer. And the game is extremely unlikely to install on many systems. But before we get to that, let's go into a bit more of detail.

**Why?**

Terraria, it uses an extremely proprietary Microsoft library called XNA, which sits on top of another proprietary technology called .NET. This makes installing and running the game much more difficult on a non-Windows system, since you have to install extra libraries which can give you their own troubles. 

[This](http://tom-geiger.de/?p=163) is the most popular guide concerning the installation of Terraria on a Linux system. It doesn't work on my system because the .NET 4.0 installer is broken

**Alternatives**

While .NET may be a proprietary technology, so what's the solution? 

[MonoGame](https://monogame.codeplex.com)

And now for the prestige: Terraria could perfectly run on Mono and MonoGame

What you saw in the video is not possible to do for a ""normal"" user because the author of the video had to reverse engineer some of the stuff and hack a lot to get it running like this. But the proof of concept still stands and the video goes back to August 2011. That's a lot of time and Terraria developers have shown no support for allowing their game to run natively (or even properly through Wine) on Linux systems and continue to rely on the proprietary XNA and .NET Framework systems which can't even be ""emulated"" by Wine in many cases. 

So with this post I want to make an appeal to Terraria users to ask the developers for full Mono+MonoGame support in Terraria and the Terraria developers to think a bit about Linux users. I thought independent developers cared more about users, most people pirate Windows for ""free"" anyway.

I'm not asking the devs to rewrite Terraria from scratch using open technologies like SDL (although it'd be great)

Please, why shouldn't we be able to play them if it requires little effort for the developers to do so? Thanks for your time.",,False,self,t5_2sg5b,True,,

I have been playing for a while with multiple run-throughs and several worlds, hit 1, kill a firebat, hit 5, place another block etc...

If you're on your sword, it will switch to the torch to place it without having to switch tools (or a glowstick if you're in water).  Then if you're trying to dig something and hit shift it will switch to your drill or pickaxe, but if you let go of shift you'll still be on your sword.

As I said, even accidentally, I hope this helps at least 1 other dumbass like myself.

I'm sorry I stopped updating [my project](http://www.reddit.com/r/Terraria/comments/1aimvr/because_i_hate_everything_a_campaign_to_corrupt/) if any of you have been following. Something happened and... well

So the original goal was to corrupt the entire world. Once I had started corruption in various places in the world

Well

Once I was certain that I had removed all natural hallow, I grabbed some vile powder and neutralized the blocks of pearlstone I embedded in the dirt and hallow grass growing above it, as well as the garden I made above the towers. I was pretty thorough and made sure that not a single block of hallow remained in the world.

And apparently the game unloaded itself. It went through the saving process, even after ~300 hours of playing it.

I initially figured it was a glitch. So I load the world again with my main chara.

There was nothing in it.

I just spawned mid-air and started falling. There were no blocks. Not even BGM. There was background, I saw the underground layer background advance from below. There was no background illumination anymore... so everything was just... dark.

I don't know how long I fell, silence and emptiness. I expected to get hit by a bat on the way down, but that didn't happen either, so maybe there weren't even creatures in the world anymore.

Then I reached hell. I don't know when I crossed the boundary. I could only tell that I was at the bottom of the world because it was illuminated from below the screen. When I landed

I was... freaked out a little. But I eventually decided to explore, but no dialogue or shopping screen popped up.

I continued on and saw yet another Merchant

I started walking to the other side for some reason. Even as I was weirded out by what I was seeing, all looking at my direction. I returned to where I fell and continued walking. I saw a Mechanic and another Nurse.

Then I saw Dryad.

She was walking toward me

Usually you move faster than NPCs when they ambulate aimlessly

As expected

I was at the end of the world. The screen stopped scrolling and I had driven myself into the very bottom left of the world. As soon as I stopped moving

The moment Dryad touched me

When I went to play the world again

I figure Terraria deleted the world

The best explanation I could come up with was that this event was a ""punishment"" for letting Corruption win or something. I think the NPCs I saw at the bottom of hell were ones that died when I was fighting bosses and wyverns at the top of the tower. It could be something else

I think I'm gonna put off playing Terraria for a while. It's exciting that Terraria for XBL was released a few days ago

Still, I wonder about the percentage of Terraria players who were obsessive enough to get rid of all hallow in a world...

The idea I had would that it would mainly be run by you guys; I'd be transparent about any issues, and in response would put things like when to change maps, map size, max player limit, etc., down to you guys, using a polling system

Depending on the amount of RAM/bandwidth it requires, i'm paying for X ram, and Y players requires (X+Z)Ram. I would also be funding the hosting costs via donations (paypal) of which will not be mandatory (otherwise it isn't a donation, right?) but, without covering the hosting costs for a month, it wont be up until then.

So, and if so do you have any feedback, and if not, any suggestions/comments as to why?

* A **Muramasa** (Dungeon).
* A **Fiery Greatsword** (The Underworld AKA Hell).
* A **Blade of Grass** (The Underground Jungle).

I did this run on a small world without memorizing the map or using 3rd party tools or cheats (including exiting to evade death).  My final time is 03:27:46 (which I've greatly condensed in the videos).  I may try a later run with a memorized map

Enjoy!

1374466456.0,1isisu,I've got a story and a first time realization...,Rager133,109,21,45,"So recently I've been preparing to go fight The WoF. I was actually typing plans out in notepad. After making a platform over the Underworld

* Molten Armor set
* Minishark
* 1500+ Silver Bullets
* Masterful Demon Scythe
* Superior Night's Edge
* 3 Ironskin potions
* 3 Swiftness potions
* 3 Regeneration potions
* 30 Health Potions
* Rocket Boots
* Obsidian Horseshoe

Well, but  remembered I had a ton of extra Guide Voodoo Dolls so I decided to use one as a joke fight and to get a little teaspoon taste of the hell that was soon to come.

All I had was:

* Molten Armor Set
* Night's Edge
* Masterful Demon Scythe
* Minishark
* Roughly 800 Silver Bullets
* 5 Health Potions

That's basically what I take with me everywhere.

So anyway

It wasn't as intimidating as I thought. That didn't stop me from immediately shooting at it with my minishark and running like hell. It was a simple 2 bit strategy

It was only about 3 minutes in I noticed its health at about 1300. I also noted I had only used one health potion

I get it down far enough where I could melee it if I wanted to

The meat bits flew down, still very shocked and not believing what had happened, and went back up my hellivator. (I'm this far in the game and I STILL don't have a Magic Mirror)

Lemme just say, as beautiful as it is hard. Everything was so different... I got to the surface and destroyed about 7 demon altars with my Pwnhammer, blessing my world with those precious ores. I finally get back home, organize my inventory, and think:

**""The game has just begun""**

The second half of the problem is that Mediumcore sounds like it should be ""normal"".  But what's now called ""Softcore"" is the original

Here's an overview of how each ""death style"" works:

* **Softcore** (""Normal death"") — When you die, you'll drop two of them; you won't make change.

* **Mediumcore** (""Punishing death"") — When you die, crash, or hit the item limit (about 200).

Some sort of ~~""portals""~~ ""gateways"" could be crafted out of different gems (to create portals of different colors) and many other precious items (so these ~~portals~~ gateways are not crafted easily). When one is placed and right-clicked, at the expense of massive amounts of mana, the player is teleported there. Also, some kind of talisman should have to be obtained from the Dungeon in order to use the ~~portals~~ gateways.
