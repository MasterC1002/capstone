Last week i saw some figure about their total sales and it blew me away so I started reading on wiki about them. 

Long story short The beatles have been playing almost constantly since then. I've been listening to the albums chronologically and I'm up to sgt pepper. 

 I just thought I'd share with you guys how excited I am. I don't think I've ever been infatuated with music like this before.

I've owned a guitar for several years and learned a few things but I'm completely inspired to pick it back up with this intensely rejuvenated inspiration.

It's crazy that I get to experience this in such a short time. 

Is there anything anyone could think to recommend maybe?

Like waiting x amount of time between album y and z

I've been binge listening to them and I don't want to ruin anything hahah. Maybe that's a silly question. I'm just really stoked.

Take care all


EDIT:

 To my happy surprise I discovered that I somehow skipped over 3 entire albums after ""With the Beatles"". I don't know why I thought that. But other than being embarrassed about not being able to read properly

I've listened to Please Please Me dang near 20 times it seems already

I really am excited

Released: March 22

**Singles:**

* Love Me Do / P.S. I Love You
* Please Please Me / Ask Me Why
* From Me to You / Thank You Girl
* She Loves You / I’ll Get You

Four smiling Liverpudlian boys look down over the stairwell inside EMI’s London headquarters in Manchester Square on the cover of their debut, George Harrison (lead guitarist), and Ringo Starr (drummer) pose in matching suits below their band name: The Beatles. Little did they know their debut, impressively hitting the top of the UK album charts in the summer of 1963, would catapult the band to worldwide success.

The album consists of soul, edited, and mixed in just under 25 hours in a single studio session in February 1963. Upon its release, the album kick started a run of number one albums, a success that was awarded to eleven out of their twelve studio albums.

**Highlights:**

*  I Saw Here Standing There (Lennon/McCartney)
*  Anna (Got to Him) [Arthur Alexander]
*  Please Please Me (Lennon/McCartney)
*  Baby It’s You (The Shirelles)
*  Twist and Shout (The Top Notes)

**With the Beatles** 

Released: November 22

**Singles:**

* I Want to Hold Your Hand / This Boy

Compared to Please Please Me, A Hard Days Night). Not only are the originals part of the group’s greatest, their covers are the highlight of the album. “Till There Was You” showcases McCartney’s amazing voice, “It Won’t Be Long” is a rock n’ roll classic that sounds fresh after 50 years, and Lennon’s “Money” cover is just fantastic.

**Highlights:**

*  It Won’t Be Long
*  All My Loving
*  Don’t Bother Me
*  Till There Was You (Meredith Willson)
*  Roll Over Beethoven (Chuck Berry)
*  Money (That’s What I Want) [Barrett Strong]

**A Hard Day’s Night** 

Released: July 10

**Singles:**

* Can’t Buy Me Love / You Can’t Do That
* A Hard Day’s Night / Things We Said Today

The group appeared on their first live US television program on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964. The eruption of Beatlemania continued when the group played at Washington Coliseum and two shows at Carnegie Hall. The group was at their busiest they had been at the time, and a motion picture starring the fab four.

This album contains all original Lennon/McCartney songs. Side one works as a soundtrack for the movie of the same name

**Highlights:**

* If I Fell
* And I Love Her
* Can’t Buy Me Love
* Any Time at All
 
**Beatles For Sale** 

Released: December 4

**Singles:**

* I Feel Fine / She’s a Woman
* Eight Day a Week / I Don’t Want to Spoil the Party

Beatles for Sale is the group’s weakest in their catalogue - with songs such as “Mr. Moonlight”

However

**Highlights:**

* No Reply
* Rock and Roll Music (Chuck Berry)
* Eight Days a Week
* I Don't Want to Spoil the Party

**Help!** 

Released: August 6

**Singles:**

* Ticket to Ride / Yes it Is
* Help! / I’m Down
* Yesterday / Act Naturally

In 1965, notably in the song “Yesterday”.
Such as in the album A Hard Day’s Night

**Highlights:**

* Help!

* The Night Before

* You’ve Got to Hide Your Love Away

* You’re Going to Lose That Girl

* I’ve Just Seen a Face

**Rubber Soul** 

Released: December 3

**Singles:**

* Nowhere Man / What Goes On

* We Can Work It Out / Day Tripper

This is the album the group step into maturity and complex lyrics. The character portrait of “Nowhere Man” had Lennon exploring exploring his inner thoughts 

It is one of my favorites! It is the first in perfect albums The Beatles would release until their breakup. Every song is beautifully crafted and shaped into perfection - the clashing of Lennon and McCartney is obvious and a pleasure to listen to. My personal favorite is “Michelle” - that bass line solo is superb.

**Highlights:**

* Drive My Car

* Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)

* Nowhere Man

* The Word

* Michelle

* Girl

* I’m Looking Through You

* In My Life

**Revolver** 

Released: August 5

**Singles:**

* Yellow Submarine / Eleanor Rigby

* Paperback Writer / Rain

The Beatles’ bubble bursts in 1966 as the loveable mop tops become the most hated band of the US southern states. In June, The Beatles unintentionally snubbed the nation’s first lady, Imelda Marcos.

Finally

After the shit storm, and artful songwriting - Harrison was now a major songwriting contributor. This was their peak of creativity.
“Tomorrow Never Knows” is my personal favorite - the lyrics were inspired by Timothy Leary’s The Book of the Dead. The tape loops are fun and Lennon’s vocals are beautifully weird. I also love the different genres - “Taxman”, and the use of brass instruments is a first in the soul song “Got to Get You into My Life”.

**Highlights:**

* Taxman

* Eleanor Rigby

* I’m Only Sleeping

* Love You To

* And Your Bird Can Sing

* For No One

* Got to Get You Into My Life

* Tomorrow Never Knows

**Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band** 

Released: June 1

**Singles:**

* Penny Lane / Strawberry Fields

After August 29

In November 1966, featuring a forty-piece orchestra, was the peak of Lennon and McCartney’s collaborative songwriting.

When the album was released, Jefferson Airplane, The Grateful Dead - all of them released their debuts in 1967.

**Highlights:**

* Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

* Getting Better

* Fixing a Hole

* She’s Leaving Home

* Within You Without You

* Lovely Rita

* A Day in the Life

**Magical Mystery Tour** 

Released: November 27

**Singles:**

* All You Need is Love / Baby You’re a Rich Man

* Hello

The psychedelic fun continues in Magical Mystery Tour. While the wacky “I Am the Walrus” and the flower power anthem of “All You Need is Love” are signifiers for LSD-coated jovial times

Nonetheless, and Hello, Goodbye (while repetitive) is surprising catchy (and my first favorite Beatle song!) Side two may be better than it’s opener. Lennon’s magnum opus “Strawberry Fields Forever” is as lyrically brilliant as it is instrumentally outrageous.

**Highlights:**

* Magical Mystery Tour

* Flying

* I Am the Walrus

* Hello

* Strawberry Fields Forever

* Penny Lane

* All You Need is Love

**The Beatles** 

Released: November 22

**Singles:**

* Lady Madonna / The Inner Light

* Hey Jude / Revolution

After the traumatic death of the group’s manager in the fall of 1967

The sessions began in May and ended in mid-October 1968. During the sessions, and Harrison was blossoming as a powerful songwriter. Relations grew sour with Lennon’s new romantic girlfriend Yoko Ono.

The group still prevailed and released their most innovative and compelling album yet. The Elvis-like, proto-metal sounds of “Yer Blues” and “Helter Skelter” juxtapose the gentle “Julia” and “I Will” and “Revolution 9” still frightens me to this day.

**Highlights:**

* Back in the U.S.S.R.

* Dear Prudence

* While My Guitar Gently Weeps

* Happiness Is a Warm Gun

* Blackbird

* I Will

* Julia

* Yer Blues

* Mother Nature’s Son

* Sexy Sadie

* Helter Skelter

**Yellow Submarine**

Released: January 17

As a fan, 2009 remasters) include the album.

The album serves as a soundtrack to the 1968 film and not much else. It contained only four previously unreleased songs recorded during the Pepper

**Highlights:**

* Only a Northern Song

* All Together Now

* Hey Bulldog

* Pepperland (George Martin)

**Let it Be**

Released: May 8

**Singles:** 

* Get Back / Don’t Let Me Down

For sake of keeping this in chronological order

Let it Be

Director Michael Lindsay-Hogg filmed the group at Twickenham Film Studios in January 1969. The group describe the sessions as “miserable” and an aggravated Harrison walked out for five days. Harrison agreed to return only if the group relocated at Apple Studios. They agreed and the bulk of the album was finished.

While the psychedelic sounds of Pepper are fascinating but the down to basics of Let it Be is one I listen to more frequently. The folky “Two of Us” is calming as well as “Across the Universe”. The band also digs up an abandoned “One After 909” and explores their roots in “Get Back”. The title track is also one of McCartney’s greatest gifts to the world.

**Highlights:**

* Two of Us

* Dig a Pony

* Across the Universe

* I Me Mine

* Let it Be

* I’ve Got a Feeling

* One After 909

* For You Blue

* Get Back

**Abbey Road** 

Released: September 26

**Singles:**

* The Ballad of John and Yoko / Old Brown Shoe

* Something / Come Together

After a surprising phone call from McCartney to George Martin for another album

The group’s harmony singing is highlighted on this album in tracks such as “Oh! Darling” and notably in “Because”. The cool groovy strut of “Come Together” is interrupted by Harrison’s love masterpiece “Something” and then intercepted by McCartney’s childish “Maxwell’s Silver Hammer”. Even Starr brings his A-game with “Octopus’s Garden”.
The album’s closing medley is a wonderful experience that beautifully ends with “The End” - a song that was the group’s goodbye to the world.

**Highlights:**

* Come Together

* Something

* Oh! Darling

* I Want You (She’s So Heavy)

* Here Comes the Sun
