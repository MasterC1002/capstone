I'm trying to collect some useful information and will update here:

* [NASA Mission pages for Mars Science Laboratory](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/) which has a countdown clock until time of landing.

* /u/zero_dogg has created a [permatime link](http://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/xpsfj/the_official_rnasa_curiosity_landing_thread/c5olni8) that will show you when the landing is scheduled in your timezone.

* /u/songkran [clarifies what we'll be seeing](http://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/xpsfj/the_official_rnasa_curiosity_landing_thread/c5okanz). **If you're asking what you'll be seeing

* The closest we can get to actually ""seeing"" what happens live is to use the live view of the [Eyes on the Solar System simulator](http://eyes.nasa.gov/)

* Here's a [timeline for the events](http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/msl-what-to-expect-on-sunday-night) (appears to be in PDT) from someone blogging at JPL.

* /u/workman161 has set up an IRC channel [here](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23curiosity)

**Edit 1**: Corrected GMT landing time.

**Edit 2**: Tried to answer the FAQ of ""what will we be seeing"". Added link to MSL timeline via IEEE

""To all employees:

Congress just passed a law that bars NASA, and Department of Justice from buying IT systems that have been ""produced, manufactured or assembled"" by companies ""owned, operated or subsidized"" in any way by the Chinese. The only exceptions to this rule are for hardware that is deemed to be in the interests of national security, or if the FBI decides that a component¹s acquisition does not carry any risk of ""cyber-espionage or sabotage.""   While Goddard is working out processes to handle this legislation, the direction from Goddard's Chief Information Officer is that no IT products shall be purchased at this time, via P-card of any other mechanism.  This applies to hardware, and to both civil servant and contractor purchases.  

Your cooperation is appreciated.   We'll inform you when we have further guidelines from the Center.""

I applied because this opportunity seemed interesting and I definitely fit well within what they were looking for. Nonetheless

I don't even know how much they want me to know before even starting but I think its a good idea to go into the interview with some knowledge.

This is what the background information reads.

&gt;The Ground Systems Engineering section (393) is improving the capture of processes and products involved in developing and deploying mission operations systems (MOS) and ground data systems (GDS) for many of JPL’s flight missions. This includes approaches such as developing web-based resources as well as expanding the use of model-based systems engineering (MBSE.)

And the project description.

&gt;Create a Ground System knowledge inventory (Body of Knowledge) and training-related items. This will be done by eliciting information from subject matter experts in interviews, wikis, etc. The task may also include creating model components and views using the MagicDraw tool and improvements to the user interface with, and output products from, the project model.

Any help in understanding these concepts

General interview tips would also be appreciated for something like this. It will most likely be over Skype or telephone and I can't imagine not nervously and frantically walking around.

NASA has a proud history of accomplishments and is clearly the world's leader in space research. The agency has a bright future in pursuing the many challenges of space exploration in the next century.
 
As you know, the American taxpayers.
 
One of the ways NASA can offset costs and maximize project benefits is to more aggressively facilitate the commercial use of the Space Station's assets. In the past I have supported legislation to permit and encourage corporate participation to the maximum extent possible. By involving the private sector in the Station's operations
 
I have also worked to impose a price cap on the development costs of the International Space Station. A price cap would have placed funding constraints on the program and motivated NASA to be more resourceful with their budgeting. I do not think this is unreasonable
 
Please be assured I will continue to work with NASA to ensure that the International Space Station is both fiscally responsible and produces the best possible scientific research. Thank you again for contacting me on this issue.

1345260537.0,yev9r,What does reddit think of a Political Action Committee (PAC) for NASA?,NiteDriver,43,9,6,"Hi folks

A NASA PAC!.

A Political Action Committee to champion the causes of NASA in particular and Science in general in both the government and legislative arenas. Think about this for a moment. A lobbying organization similar to the ones for political groups. Or the ""pro or anti"" groups for the many public arguments about personal weaponry

Among some of the things it could pull off:

* 1) Lobby for an amendment to place NASA beyond the political-vagaries of each election-cycle by fixing NASA's funding to a level pegged to the national-budget or the GDP, confidence, and the ability to design and execute real (and not just notional) long-range and even multi-decadal plans and missions which are a necessity in aeronautical-research and space-exploration.

* 2) Lobby for relaxing any prohibitions that prevent NASA from self-promotion. This could help set the record straight in so many ways and in so many places. Helping debunk the many urban legends and myths that surround NASA and it's accomplishments. And besides, no law against that!

* 3) Sponsor legislators that are pro NASA and/or pro Science. Dispel untruths or half truths about NASA used in the political arena by politicians against each other.

* 4) Promote NASA in other ways that NASA cannot itself do.

* 5) It can be a  powerful 3 or 4 way interface between public, and maybe even industy.

I am, I'm sure, breaking some law or other.

So I'm putting it out there for people to consider and maybe **someone** more creditable will think it's a good idea as well and **run with it**. As for me

PACs are pretty much self sustaining. Operating cash comes (popular causes generates a lot [mountains] of money!) from the folks that are like-minded. But connectedness and deep pockets are required to get the ball rolling.

If you wish

Please

... imagine
""Do you want to see us continue to spend more money

Great film

Within a day or two after the mission

(102:45:17 GET - LMP (Buzz Aldrin)
40 feet

Although you begin to see dust being blown away at about 100 ft. altitude, no one could sync up the film with the timeline and voice, because there was no time reference on the film. Since Buzz was totally busy with the landing, he couldn’t be sure exactly when he saw the dust. Our top management was looking at a silent film with no time reference, and the crew was trying to explain how well they could see surface features, created a problem that needed better information.  Although the crew said it was not a problem for them, there was a legitimate concern that on later flights, obscuring the crews vision at a critical time during the landing.

At that time, a job that made him responsible for everything on that mission, and for resolving miscellaneous problems that arose that didn’t seem to belong to anyone else. It was a good job, because it got me a console in one of the back rooms of Mission Control during all the Apollo missions.  Since I was the assistant, we discussed the problem. Without knowing that there was no time reference, I asked him why the film lab couldn’t put the audio on the film so we could get a realistic view of how bad the dust was at lower altitudes. He said that they had already tried that, but the film lab said it was impossible to match up the sound with the picture accurately without the time reference. There was a good time hack when the camera was turned on, because the video we see seems to be correctly synced at the beginning and touchdown.

Since I personally knew and often worked with some of people in the film lab, or they would not release it for use. When I found out that they had no way of detecting when the landing pads hit the surface, I volunteered to give them that time hack. Even though the film would be out of sync at the beginning of descent by several minutes, I convinced them that was not a problem as long as we synced it up pretty well at touchdown. Knowing the length of the pole mounted contact switch and the descent rate, it was easy to select a point on the film that coincided with touchdown.

Once we looked at the film as you see it now

Please don’t believe that I am telling this story because of my excessive appreciation of my cleverness. I hope you are interested in the quirky issues that came up almost daily, and get one of the most important test films in history released for use. 

Now about the film

Compare this with the nonchalant atmosphere of the control room for the recent Mars  rover Curiosity landing. http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/video-view.cfm?Vid_ID=1823

I guess this defines one of the biggest differences between being a spectator in the unmanned flight control room and a participant in a manned flight control room

If you buy me a beer sometime, but any chance of landing on the moon within the time limit.

I was wondering if anybody would know where I could find the written testimony from that hearing? I don't know if this would be the correct place to ask

I am trying to find a person from the NASA (probably from the public relations department or ISS public relations department)
I have a hobby that, again as I see it.

So, find something interesting there and bring it out to the internet. For example, we’ve done a number of such tours inside the plane cockpits and asked people whose job is related to aviation and particular aircrafts to describe things that the visitor may see in the panoram.

Here are some links to the tours we’ve made:
[Planes](http://perfectumlab.com/gallery/panorams/tours/ac_rossiya/?l=en) (select plane
[A Tank](http://perfectumlab.com/gallery/panorams/tours/military/t80bv/?lang=en).
[And all other things we have](http://perfectumlab.com/en/page/panoramas).

So

As PineappleMeinster pointed it out, another approach and so on...

So here's the story: I'm an 18 year old Belgian student with a love for spaceflight. A couple of weeks ago, and everything seemed fine. They informed me that I'll need a group of at least 8 people to get a tour, so I posted a request here on Reddit and got lots of participants: me and my friend included we're with 10. Then the problems started.  
In the first email I received from the Visitor center
 &gt; The Visitor Center itself is open to the public Tuesdays through   Fridays from 10:00 am to 3:00 pm

I (incorrectly) assumed that these where the hours for tours as well. It turns out that tours are only possible tuesdays to fridays and that the last one starts at 1PM. I only arrive in DC on friday 4th of november and my plane lands at 2PM :(  
  
So I tried everything. I tried changing the flight from Orlando to DC, all my tickets, including my flight back to Belgium, get cancelled.  

The lady at the visitor center was very kind. She tried everything she could to still get me a tour on 3PM

So I once again turn to Reddit for help. If you work at Goddard and think you can help me, I'd be extremely grateful. I'd be willing to pay for it, too. And I can bring you a giant box of Belgian chocolates. :)

just wondering. What are  your thoughts about the Nasa website?

Just asking because I'm working on a small project of how the website works and reads.

What I would like to know is how you guys navigate it. The first thing you look at to the information you dismiss. Just in the index page.  Since the index does have an overwhelming amount of information that's displayed at once.


Thanks.

Hacker and James M. Grimwood. We are reading one chapter a week

Each chapter will have it's own discussion thread which links to the online copy of that chapter. The book is also available in various formats at the [Internet Archive](http://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19780012208) . I recommend the PDF version for both computer and Kindle reading. The .mobi version is of poor quality and the online version lacks some of the pictures. Also

As of today (September 2, ""The Transmutation of Mercury"".

Listed and linked below are the discussion threads for the individual chapters.

###Discussions:

1. [Chapter 1

2. [Chapter 2

3. [Chapter 3

Updates to follow. Feedback is welcome.
