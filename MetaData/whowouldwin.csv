-It is hide and go seek tag. They have to get touched by Batman to get caught.

-Batman is relying on his detective skills and instincts alone

-Batman has researched all of these people thoroughly for a five days before the game.

-Batman closed his eyes in front of the Empire State Building and counted to 100 before going after them.

-Batman has decided not to purposely go after them in any particular order. He'll go with the first clue he finds and work on it.

-No one can leave NYC.

-Batman has one week to complete the game.

-No violence. It's just hide and go seek tag.

-All of the people hiding have $150 to spend however they'd like. They may not access any other personal funds. Batman has no money. They can also find ways to make more money.

Things to keep in mind:

-This is NYC

***Here's what /u/Helmet_Icicle has to say about the number of lions:***

I think this eventually boils down to an endurance trial for the Pokemon. A single Pokemon can only be attacked by so many lions at one time, though.

It looks like the question here is whether the top tier Pokemon would be able to last until the end of the lions. Let's say powerful moves like Earthquake with a large AOE can kill one hundred lions at a time. That move will still need to be used ten million times to kill one billion lions.

---

##The 5 Rules of Hulk 

*(Or however many we end up with.)*

1. If you're going to try and beat him to death, with no rage whatsoever. Most fights that involve the Hulk don't make sense to have him start that weak. If his opponent is an even match, Hulk will soon outclass them. If the opponent is somewhat stronger, Hulk will eventually surpass them. If the opponent is much stronger, they can beat Hulk before he can get strong enough to resist. If they are not capable of beating him before he becomes too strong for them to beat, then they can't beat him physically. 

 A. Attacking Bruce Banner will result in the Hulk emerging. Only in alternate universes and when his powers are somehow inaccessible has Banner ever been attacked without changing form before any serious damage is done.

 B.  Banner may be knocked out or rendered harmless by drugging him in human form

2. If you're going to try and exhaust the Hulk, then be capable of sparring him until he exhausts himself. Sparring in such a way is difficult, because anything you do to anger the Hulk, like hitting him, will only make him stronger and replenish his stamina.


3. If you're going to try and manipulate reality

4. If you're going to use energy attacks

 A. Hulk has the ability to adapt to almost any conditions, and survive extremes in temperature. If you are going to try to use a natural force such as the Sun or a Black hole to beat Hulk and a Rule 1 is not possible, Hulk will not die. He may become trapped, but as suns and black holes both emit gamma radiation, if it doesn't kill him, he will only become stronger. Even without the gamma rays, the pain would make him angrier, but only if it utilizes Rule 1. 

5. If you're going to try something else


If none of the above can be applied to the fighter you're asking about, faster, more agile, and can heal faster as he gets angrier, and he has NO LIMIT to his maximum power range. The only real limits we've seen are that he can't develop new powers, and he can't fight what he can't touch. 

---

##List of evidence

*(This is where we show how the rules were used by those who beat him in the past. It will be restructured

 * Maul is one I'm unfamiliar with

 * Thor was originally written by Stan Lee to be stronger than the Hulk. He wins through use of Rules 1 and 2, or when Hulk trumps a Rule 1 with a sudden and massive power increase, Hulk can and has beaten Thor. This is largely due to Thor's refusal to actually kill Hulk or Banner.

 * The Maestro is a possible future version of the Hulk. Rule 1 and possibly 2.

 * Red Hulk used Rules 1

 * Abomination *nearly* killed Hulk through use of Rule 1. Then Banner/Hulk beat him. 

 * Leader used Rules 1, though I forget if his 3 was telepathic or technological. 

 * Wolverine has lost in every battle with the Hulk that didn't end in a stalemate, thanks to his nearly infinite knowledge of martial arts. 

 * I can't remember Namor's battle, if any, apply. 

 * Zeus beat him too, and 5, with a possibility of Rule 3.

 * The Punnisher killed the Hulk in an alternate universe comic through use of Rule 1A. 

 * In WWH, which backfires. Still, had Strange attacked, even Warbound Hulk would have been vulnerable to a Rule 4 defeat from someone with a magical ability so high. This also counts as a variant of Rule 1. 

 * Also in WWH, and 4. His calming aura usually works against Hulk, but WWH showed us that even *that* is subject to the Rule 1 stipulations. If Hulk gets angry enough, Sentry's calming aura may stop or slow his rage growth, but Hulk can keep fighting even then. This fight was said to be a draw, but Banner was the last one standing even after both fighters reverted to human form, and then became an even stronger version of the Hulk only moments later when provoked.

Always state the version of Batman you are using. Comic, etc. If you do not, it will generally be assumed to be the Comic version.

Always limit Batman. If given enough time to prepare and enough resources, especially not superhumans. He has a plan to neutralize each and every one he's aware of. 

If you aren't giving Batman any prep time, the more information you can give about the location and conditions of the fight, (ANY fight, not just those involving Batman) the better. 

Tell us where they're fighting, what the time limit might be, if help is allowed, etc. Anything that can make this Batman fight less ambiguous than every other Batman fight we've seen.

Setting: DC universe (your choice)  

Rules: You have 10 years prep and enough money for one or more DC universe megaprojects. Your objective is to kill *(or incapacitate) Superman by any means possible

If you try to recruit heroes to your side

If you recruit villains

Superman is off doing Superman things for the 10 years and doesn't even know who you are, and FTL super speed, though, so you probably won't be able to do a surprise attack unless you account for it.

If you beat Superman

If you lose to Superman

Do you win and live? Do you lose and die? If you win

Now alphabetized. 

Metal|Qualities|||
:---|:---|:---|:---
Adamantium *(main Marvel timeline)*|Indestructible once cooled, by gods.) Most notably used by Weapon X on Wolverine's bones.|
Adamantium-vibranium alloy *(main Marvel timeline)*|The only known use of this metal is in Captain America's shield. The alloy grants it unusual properties
Amazonium  *(main DC timeline)*|Indestructible
Anti-metal (Antarctic Vibranium) *(main Marvel timeline)*|Native to the Savage Land. This variation produces vibrations of a specific wavelength that breaks down the molecular bonds in other metals
Baatorian Green Steel/Dajavva *(Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe)*|A steel alloy from the Lawful Evil outer plane of Baator. It is lighter and stronger than normal steel. Similar to mithril but with properties that make it a notably more deadly weapon. A similar form is Tanar'ri Red Steel (fan creation)
Beskar/Mandalorian Iron *(Star Wars universe)*|A near-indestructible iron ore. The introduction of certain additives during the smelting process serve to increase the strength of the natural ore. Able to withstand blows from even a lightsaber. In the foundry, beskar is significantly heavier.|
Brightsteel *(Inheritance universe)*|A rare metal of extraterrestrial origin used to make Dragon Rider swords. Lighter than regular steel, but gains them when forged while singing magic into the steel. Without enchanting it while forging, it is simply lighter, harder, and more flexible than steel.|
Carbonadium *(main Marvel timeline)*|A resilient
Celestial Bronze *(Percy Jackson/Heroes of Olympus universe)*|Mined from Mount Olympus, demigods are also affected by it because of their blood. Artifacts of celestial bronze are known to emit a faint bronze glow. Monsters disperse into dust once a sword or weapon made up of the metal passes through them.|
Cortosis *(Star Wars universe)*|A very rare, although the effect only lasts a few seconds. Commonly woven into armor or used to make anti-lightsaber melee weapons. |
Cuendillar/Heartstone *(Wheel of Time universe)*|An almost indestructible substance created during the Age of Legends. It absorbs any force attempting to break it
Durasteel *(Star Wars universe)*|An incredibly strong and versatile metal alloy, carbon, meleenium, neutronium, and zersium. It is capable of withstanding blistering heat, frigid cold, and monumental physical stress, durasteel was used for almost everything, it could still corrode in the same manner as lesser steel alloys
|Dwarven alloy (Elder Scrolls)|No other race has replicated whatever process was used to create dwarven metal. Although it can be easily mistaken for bronze - and in fact many forgers of dwarven materials use bronze to create their fake replicas - it is most definitely a distinct type of metal of its own.|
|Ebony (Elder Scrolls) |Raw ebony itself is an extremely hard, said to be the crystalized blood of the gods.|
Element Zero/eezo *(Mass Effect universe)*|Atomic Number 0, releases dark energy which can be manipulated into a mass effect field, raising or lowering the mass of all objects within that field. A positive current increases mass, a negative current decreases it. This ""mass effect"" is used in countless ways, from generating artificial gravity to manufacturing high-strength construction materials. It is most prominently used to enable faster-than-light space travel without causing time dilation.|
Karach/Chaos Matter *(Dungeons and Dragons universe)*|A material that can change it's shape, it can become the sharpest blade in the universe.|
Katchin/Klangite *(Dragon Ball Z Universe)*|A material said to be the strongest metal in the universe. Strong enough to break the sacred Z Sword, and thus is not unbreakable.|
Mithril *(Lord of the Rings universe)*|A silvery metal that is stronger than steel but much lighter in weight. The name mithril comes from two words in Sindarin—""mith""
Neosteel *(Starcraft universe)*|An extremely durable metal generally used for battle cruisers and armor reinforcement. Able to withstand faster-than-light speeds. |
Nth Metal *(main DC timeline)*|An alien metal from planet Thanagar. Ability to negate gravity, and protects them from extremes in temperature. May bestow magical abilities under some circumstances. Most notably used by Hawkman and Hawkgirl.|
Phrik *(Star Wars universe)*|One of only a few lightsaber-resistant substances known. Used in the construction of extremely light and durable battle armor as well as melee weapons. On a more extreme scale
Rearden Metal *(Atlas Shrugged universe)*|A green-blue metal that is lighter and stronger than steel. It is compared to steel as steel is to iron. |
Scrith *(Ringworld universe)*|A milky-gray translucent, with the Ringworld foundation only about 30m (100 ft) deep. Also, it is transparent to large magnetic fields. Impervious to most weapons. A body (such as a comet or asteroid) striking with enough kinetic energy may be able to deform the Ringworld floor and punch a hole. |
Sky-iron *(The Golden Compass universe)*|A type of meteoric iron that armored bears or Panserbjørne used to create their armor. Wearers tend to develop a spiritual connection to their armor. (The info says ""armour"" over and over but it's not pronounced ""ar-moor"" so I can't stand spelling it that way.)|
Ultimate Adamantium *(Marvel Earth 1610 universe)* |Not nearly as durable as mainstream admantium, it is highly useful in blocking telepathic assaults.|
Unobtanium *(James Cameron's Avatar universe)*|An extremely expensive room-temperature superconductor for energy. Unobtanium proved to be the most baffling of scientific discoveries in the area of superconductors as it had an extremely strong magnetic field, the substance found on Pandora was a stable quasi-crystal with its atoms arranged in a never-repeating but orderly pattern with fivefold symmetry. This structure was not only structurally rugged but also has microscopic voids in the quasicrystalline structure that contain the magnetic flux lines. Unobtanium has a unique magnetic field and properties of superconductivity, causing it to levitate in magnetic fields under the Meissner Effect. |
Uru *(main Marvel timeline)*|A highly durable, can only be forged in the heat of a star or an Asgardian forge, and weighs over a trillion times more than an equal quantity of lead. While not easily enchanted, uru absorbs magic like a sponge, redirecting it and enhancing the natural attributes of his wielder. The enchanting process also dramatically increases its durability. In the hands of a mystic wielder, uru's properties can change depending on the magic applied to it, generally becoming stronger and denser as it's wielder commands. While not indestructible
Valorium *(main DC timeline)*|A type of Nth Metal used by the Legion of Super Heroes in the form of flight rings.|
Valyrian Steel/Dragonsteel *(Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire)*|A magical alloy invented in Valyria and used to make weapons of unparalleled quality. It is the spells and magic that make the steel special. Valyrian steel blades are lighter, and feature distinctive rippled patterns similar to Damascus steel. Only the greatest weaponsmiths can reforge swords from existing Valyrian steel, but the secret of creating such an alloy was apparently lost with Valyria, making those remaining weapons highly treasured and extremely rare. Most Valyrian steel blades in Westeros are treasured heirlooms of noble houses.|
Wakandan Vibranium *(main Marvel timeline)*|Native to the country of Wakanda, the tougher it becomes. There are limits to the capacity of the energy that can be stored, and vibranium can be destroyed with sufficient immediate force. Most notably used by Black Panther.|

1371850054.0,1gtjbb,Luke Skywalker (Original Trilogy) vs General Grievous (The Clone Wars Animated),Zankman,70,10,59,"***Who Would Win?***

**Fighters:**

 * **Luke Skywalker** as he is seen in the Original Trilogy; to be exact

 **IMPORTANT EDIT:** Although it *is* Episode VI Luke, in Episodes 1 through 3, we can see that the Jedi are *very* athletic; this was done since technology didn't limit the filmmakers. 

 Since this is considered canon


 * **General Grievous** as he is seen in the [2003 2D TV show

**Location:** 

* **Forest Moon of Endor**; somewhere in the forest

* The encounter happens **in front** of the bunker

**Equipment:**

 * Luke has his **Lightsaber** (the one with the Green Crystal)

 * Grievous has **8 Lightsabers** (as per usual?) attached to his ""belt"".

 * There is a **Speedbike** (as seen in Episode VI) which Luke used to get around the Forest. He left it near the entrance

**State of mind:** 

 * Luke is in a **Normal** state of mind (he is his regular self); This would mean **calm

 Potential to be **naive

 * Grievous is in a **Normal** state of mind (he is his regular self); This would mean **cold, merciless, brutal and arrogant**.

 Potential to be **enraged/bloodlusted


 * Both are **quite intelligent and tactical**. 

 * **Special Note**: Grievous' Anger and Hatred were artificially augmented during his reconstruction; Besides that

**Original and New Goals:**

* **Luke's Original Goal**: Luke was on Endor after the destruction of the Death Star in Episode VI decided to wander around for a bit. Found a bunker and decided to enter it. Upon some inspection

 * **Luke's New Goal**: Interact with the mechanical being; react accordingly --&gt; Defend himself

* **Grievous' Original Goal**: Grievous opened his eyes to find himself in a random and unknown forest. He wandered around until he found a bunker

 * **Grievous' New Goal**: Interogate the human for information; react accordingly --&gt; KILL THE FILTHY JEDI SCUM!

**Special Notes:**

 * Luke is obviously a **Jedi** with access to the **Force**; for more info
 
  * As a Jedi

    
  * As the son of the Chosen One Anakin Skywalker


 * Grievous is a **cyborg** with a powerful **mechanical body**

  * His only organic parts, heart (and lungs?) are protected by his armor. 

 
  * Was trained by **Count Dooku** at Lightsaber combat until ""he could not be taught no more"". Developed a unique style and unorthodox style which sums up to: *...prolonged lightning-fast flurries and power moves designed to overwhelm his enemies.**

  * Does *not* have the ability to use the Force in any way.

 * More about the combat abilities of [Luke](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Luke_Skywalker#Powers_and_abilities) and [Grievous](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Luke_Skywalker#Powers_and_abilities).

Due to the large amount of Science fiction universes being pitted against each other I'm going to try to create a very basic tier list to help show which universes could beat different universes without any sort of limitations.  I'm not trying to discourage people asking which universe would win I'm simply trying to help people assign he correct advantages/ disadvantages to have interesting fights.  Anyway

1. Dr. Who Universe
2. The Culture
3. Warhammer 40k
4. Star Wars
5. Transformers
6. Halo
7. Mass Effect
8. Starcraft
9. BattleStar Galactica

Now I realize that there are a lot of universes not mentioned here these are just the ones that get mentioned the most on this subreddit.  If you want another universe added just tell me maybe link a wiki page that could tell me about ship strengths and numbers so I could accurately list it.

**Each Universe:**

The following will be a breakdown of what each universes' main strengths are and why I have listed them in the order they are listed.  For multi-factioned Universes I will break them down and rank them where appropriate.

**The Dr. Who Universe:**

The reason that the Dr. Who Universe is number is due to the scale of the Time War.  In this universe two factions with control over time went to war.  This war was long and brutal and lasted from simple years to millenia based on perspective.  In this war people were resurrected by replaying battles over and over by each side to ensure their side won.  They raised entire cultures over millenia just to have them sacrificed because of how huge this war was.  When it was finally over the docter described the ""*final days of the war as ""hell"", the Nightmare Child, the Could-Have-Been King with his army of Meanwhiles and Never-Weres"" constituting particularly disturbing developments*"" Meaning that some of the smartest minds in the galaxy may or may not have participated due to how screwed up the timeline got.  Basically any universe that does not have access to time travel will never even have existed if they challenge this one

**The Culture:**

I admit this is the universe I am least familiar with and appears least frequently here I am including it on reputation alone and the fact that people who know about it unanimously believe it could beat the 40k universe easily.

[Here is a great writeup](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1h7s4d/scifi_universe_tier_list/carpwsw) done by /u/OlafTheSpaceViking

**Warhammer 40k:**

Warhammer 40k is a universe about Humanity in the year 40

Basically life sucks

**Star Wars:**

The Star Wars universe is one of the most iconic universes in the entire Sci-Fi genre.  It is a universe where planets can be blown up by multiple weapons and is a universe where being of immense power rule.  The reason that it is third place on the list is pretty much that George Lucas didn't really care about accuracy when creating it and decided to add several zeroes to the end of all the power numbers.  Couple that with Dark Master who can destroy fleets in seconds and others who can absorb planets for power and you have a universe where not matter what time period you enter it will kick some serious other-planetary ass

**Transformers:**

A universe made up of ancient robotic beings.  They are very powerful and durable all of which can transform into various vehicles.  They are also capable of reaching gargantuan sizes some being the size of spacecrafts and some being entire cities.  There is also the technology to immediately teleport across huge amounts of space as well as a god who can eat stars and has only been killed with fragments of a god.

**Halo:**

Halo is a very interesting universe with 3 or more factions vying for power at all times.  To help show how powerful each faction is I shall do a breakdown each faction.

Forruners: The Forerunners are a very interesting race because they are the most advanced race to ever exist within the Halo universe and are on the Warhammer 40k level of power.  When they realized that their species was doomed they were able to create no less than 7 super-weapons each capable of annihilating all life within the galaxy.  They also created several artificial planets and are some of the most powerful being ever anywhere.  

Another point for Forereunner are the precursors [here is a great comment explaining both their power levels and that of the Forerunners](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1h7s4d/scifi_universe_tier_list/carrfs9)

Humans (UNSC): Humans have actually had two stages however most information comes from the second so that is where it will be focused on.  The Humans are a strong race which prefer to use kinetic and bullet based weapons to deal their damage.  Each of their main ships are equipped with Nukes as well as MAC's which are cannons capably of accelerating their payload close to lightspeed to do serious damage.  They also train SPARTANS which are elite modified troops who's armor is comparable to that Forerunners had.  Couple that with their unbreakable bones

Convenant: The covenant are collection of species brought together under the prophets to complete the great journey.  They use plasma based weapons which are adapted from Forerunner technology.  Their ships are so strong it was considered a fair fight when the UNSC had a 3 to 1 advantage

Flood:  The Flood are a parasite capable of wiping out entire species.  They are arguably the strongest faction in the Halo universe as they control multiple galaxies however in the only explored one they are a smaller albeit deadly threat.  The Flood is a virus which will spread to sentient life taking over the bodies and attempting to spread more.  They can use weapons and pilot ships as well as being very resistant to the effects of space/ vacuum.  They can also infect dead bodies meaning that in fights when their enemies are dead they can take over the deceased bodies.

**Mass Effect:**

Mass Effect is a universe controlled by reapers sentient ships which wipe out the galaxy every 50

Humanity: Humans and their allies are based in the year 23rd century where they discovery of Mass Relays allowed for instant teleportation across the galaxy.  The weapons in this universe are also very advanced and are in fact much better than those of the Halo universe.    They also have Biotics which is very similar to The Force.  Biotics have very unclear rules however it is a huge bonus in combat situations.  

The reason that they are below Halo is that while the weapons are much stronger the ship to ship combat is much more even and the Covenant forces would easily beat Humanity in Mass Effect

Reapers:  The Reapers are very advanced ships which are hundreds of thousands of years old.  They purge the galaxy every 50

**Starcraft:**

Starcraft is unfortunately one of the weakest of these universes however they are still very capable of fighting.  They are divided into three main factions of:

Protoss

Terran: Essentially humans in this universe which mainly use ammunition and bullet based weapons

Zerg: A strange species which goes through very rapid evolution and communicates telepathically with one another and who's leader has access to some very strong telepathic abilities and very strong telekinesis.

**BattleStar Galactica:**

The BSG universe is comprised of 2 main factions. Aside from FTL drives

12 Colonies of Kobol Formed after the first Cylon war nearly destroyed humanity. Purposfully has denetworked and brought technolgy backwards in order to defend against superior Cylon computer hacking. Uses brute force and firepower in their ship design. Battlestars are tough ships but ultimatly out of their league when taking on most other universes with very weak nuclear weapons being main armerments. Colonial FTL drives however

Cylons similar to the colonials in technology. The Cylons have far more advance computers and FTL drives and do have a very powerful advantage in ressurection technology. Cylon culture seems to be very mobile as thier home is a massive star station capable of FTL jumps. Cylon warships however

**Conclusion:**

As I said before if there are any questions or other universes that ought to be added just comment or message me and I will do my best to update this when I can.  I hope you all enjoy this and use it to make sure that the fights can be as close as possible.  If I have any incorrect information please tell me preferably with evidence to why I am wrong and I will fix it as soon as possible

##The 5 Rules of Batman

*(These almost never work when used individually. Most ""losses"" for Batman come from an enemy or enemies using multiple Rules against him at once.)*


1. If you are going to face Batman, and the habit of over-preparing for highly unlikely scenarios ""just in case"". He already has plans to take out every member of the Justice League and every other superhuman he's encountered. If Batman is allowed time to prepare for a fight, and has no limits but the resources and alliances he has access to in the DC universe, he is almost inexplicably unbeatable. It's not fair, but it's the way the character is written. With the exception of truly omnipotent fighters and those who outclass Batman in every possible way, (sometimes, even then) his victory though being prepared is unfairly guaranteed because he's overly prepared for it and every possibility associated with it. (This Rule was utilized by every fighter who has ever beaten or will ever beat Batman. None of us *like* it. We just learn to accept it. So deal. Complain to DC. I don't work for them. Don't tell me how you disagree with this one anymore. I have no control over it. Stop it.) End result- give Batman no prep time and limit his resources to what he usually has on him. Make it a single round with no chance for a rematch

2. If you are going to try to outfight Batman
 
 A. Knowledge of every fighting style in the world
 
 B. Superior strength, and/or speed, (having only one is not a guaranteed victory)

 C. Possession of a hidden weapon or ability that Batman couldn't possibly know about

 D. The element of surprise

 E. Insider knowledge of his fighting style. 

3. If you are going to try to out-think Batman

4. If you are going to out-tech Batman

5. Other than those

___

##List of evidence

Bane broke Batman's back through use of Rules 1 and 2. There may have also been uses of others

Joker has beaten Batman through use of Rules 1, and 5, but has also attempted each and failed more often that he's succeeded.

*(Before we begin, please let me know and I can adjust what I have.)* 

##For the TL;DR

Let's face it- Hulk comes up a lot. Generally, that's kind of cool, but it doesn't really satisfy, does it? Especially when you take into account [Stan Lee's claim](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEgIfpb5NHY) (and comic book history) that Thor was created specifically to be stronger than the Hulk. That video also brings up the (somewhat tongue-in-cheek) history that Marvel and Stan Lee have, where they are known for taking great pains trying to explain powers in as scientific a way as possible. (Though Stan Lee has also said the one thing he never could explain was how Hulk's pants still fit after he transforms.)

Now it's true there are many versions of the Hulk and they all have varying levels of power, we might have a better idea of what the Hulk's actual potential limits really are. Yes, they will change from version to version, but we will know a vague idea of how much and why. So let's get started.

---
It's important to remember that Hulk's strength can be roughly estimated by using his mass. If we can determine his maximum density

Let's start with size and mass. This one has been explored before on [this website](http://fanon.wikia.com/wiki/Science_of_the_Incredible_Hulk), collide, and disappear every nanosecond, and his body's absorption rate of these particles is tied to the rage centers of his brain. 

Okay, is limited by his rage, and his rage allows his body to correctly harness those particles. Therefore, we can guess that Hulk's maximum mass is directly linked to these quantum particles. Great, but what does that tell us about his actual limits? We can see his body's dimensions in relation to his height, but how tall is his maximum height?

Hulk generally doesn't get much bigger than 10 ft. In fact, I'll use 10 feet because it should be easy to extrapolate more numbers from the following figures.

Hulk's potential mass is limited by the amount of quantum particles that could fit in the space he occupies. It's illogical to say his mass is potentially indefinite, there is logically a limit to his size. 

**This limit is crucial to determining Hulk's maximum potential.**


Okay, remember) based on his maximum height and body dimensions. If we assume Hulk's maximum height is 10 feet for this equation, then all we need to know is how many quantum particles could fit into his frame while still allowing him to move. If we completely filled his frame, he would be about as dense as a black hole, which we know is impossible, as his gravity hasn't devoured our solar system. That brings up the next issue. 

While looking at Hulk's mass, (Thor's hammer Mjolnir comes to mind, as well as Onslaught's armor,) we can assume a somewhat illogical margin of error and round up. 

Hulk's potential mass can be guessed based on the fact that nothing orbits him while he is on Earth. Therefore, I'm not a physicist, so this isn't definitive) that his mass is significantly less than that of the Earth, because his gravity doesn't ever influence the Earth's orbit or rotation. Even the Moon impacts Earth's orbit and rotation, but it happens slowly and steadily, while Hulk only exists as the Hulk briefly, sporadically, while he might be capable of possessing mass large enough to potentially cause problems with the Earth's orbit and rotation

The moon's mass is 7.34767309 × 10^22 kilograms.

The mass of the Earth is 5.97219 × 10^24 kilograms.


So, (meters per second squared) and the Earth exerts 9.78 m/s². To put that in perspective, the average human exerts only 4.34 nm/s^2. (That's nano meters per second squared.)

Whatever. This isn't a math class. Anyway

Since we established above that his mass can't be too close to that of the Earth, so forgive me for the inevitable large margin of error, here.

Okay. So. If Hulk's exerting gravity equal to 5 m/s^2, and from there, determine his strength. (Since we're using some equations now, I'll be using metrics for a little. Bear with me my fellow Americans). 

Now all we need to do is decide on how much space a 3.048 meter tall Hulk would occupy: his volume. Problem? We can't really. So

An average individual's weight is around 70 kg (154.324 lbs)

V=m/M = 70/1000 = 0.07 cubic meters.

In other words

Hulk is by no means a normal human,000 cubic liters). For a comparison, look up pictures of 10,000 liter water tanks. Most large cement mixers also hold around this amount.


But remember

Density is mass divided by volume

d= m/v

We know the volume

d=m/10^3 m

Now we need to find Hulk's weight. To do this

ar^2 /G

where a is acceleration (5 m/s^2) in our case

We know the basic average of the distance from Hulk's core to his skin is around 1 meter (3.28084 ft). This is tough. He's about as wide as he is tall

So

Thanks to the magic of [this web tool](http://calculator.tutorvista.com/acceleration-due-to-gravity-calculator.html),309,354.67433 Kg. Rounding that up, we get 75 billion Kg.

Remember d=m/v? We determined that 

v= 10^3 m

and now we know that 

m= 75 billion Kg.

Therefore

d= 75 billion Kg/10^3 m

So Hulk's maximum density is 7,000 Kg/m^3.


That was a lot of work to come up with a number like that and have nothing to show for it! What does that even mean?!

I'll tell you. 

It means that every square meter of the Hulk weighs 7.5 billion killograms

---

Okay. We did all that math for this.

Knowing Hulk's density

So now we need to look at the kind of force Hulk's body can take. What sort of attacks really damage him?


We know Hulk has withstood the mightiest of Marvel's heroes. In World War Hulk, stating,

""Against an opponent this powerful...The amount of energy I'd have to expend...if I...lost control
—Sentry

This means that it's safe to assume The Sentry used very close to his full power when fighting the Hulk. This is good for us, and therefore, how much force he can exert.

We know The Sentry can destroy planets, and what destroys one might not destroy another. We know The Sentry can withstand supernovae, and thus can likely emit force greater than that of an exploding star. That we can use. A supernova releases 10^44 joules of energy which is about ten octillion megatons of TNT (I'll admit that I'm cheating on this part and not actually doing/checking the math myself, please correct me if this is wrong.)

So. If The Sentry can produce greater force than that of a supernova, then Hulk is able to exert the same amount of force as that generated by a supernova. 

Now

More to come.

 * Scaling Argument

A mammal has a size

The animal has a mass

This mammal has a thighbone

The femur carries the body

The femur has a length

The femur had a thickness

The length is how long it is

And the cross-sectional area at measure d will be area

The length of the femur must be proportional to the size of the animal. Completely plausible

l ∝ s

or

It is also reasonable that the mass of an animal is related to it's size to the third power

m ∝ s^3

That means, because of the previous point. So,

m ∝ s^3 ∝ l^3

Now

pressure ∝ weight/A ∝ m/d^2

If the pressure is higher than a certain level, let's say a factor of four, in order for the bones not to break, d^2 must also go up by a factor of four.",,False,self,1364313765.0,t3_1aw90d

Songbird's final screech howled through the underwater dystopia as Booker trembled

""There you go..."" Elizabeth cooed as the corpse of her only friend sunk to the inky black depths. Booker glanced nervously at her, seeing the classy yet ruined interior of this underwater building. ""What is this place? Elizabeth...?"" 

""A doorway... One of many."" She replied absently. Elizabeth walked down a finely-carpeted hallway

""Yes, but the small fires, leaking pipes, and rubble suggested that some terrible disaster had occurred not long ago.

""This way!"" she urged, looking for the source. 'It sounded like a young girl' he thought. Just then, he caught movement through one of the dirty windows. He squinted through the tarnished glass, and what he saw horrified him.

A haggard-looking man wearing a blood-stained sweater was looming over a little girl menacingly. Booker noticed that the man was holding a shotgun in one hand

The little girl started sobbing as she crouched near the metal figure, you son of a bitch!"" Booker shouted. The other man sneered as he grabbed the child. ""HEY! LET HER GO!"" He shouted.

""Booker

""Elizabeth

Seeing that he wasn't going to back down, but that man is a monster. But Jack's powerful. You're going to want this."" Her eyes started glowing and Booker felt charges of power raging through his body. 
""There. Now you won't run out of salts. For a while

Booker nodded. ""Thanks."" He turned around, you asked for it"" he growled. He started spinning the blades, pulled his arm back, and punched through the reinforced glass.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Jack jumped back

""Adam? Who's that?"" Booker replied, Booker's unshakable demeanor an guns scared off anyone looking to start trouble, but the promise of ADAM dissolved any fear Jack might've had. 

Jack launched a Winter Blast before Booker had time to say anything. He pulled out his wrench and started bludgeoning the frozen statue, Booker melted his Arctic prison with a Devil's Kiss, caught Jack's wrench, and launched it across the room. Jack snarled and pulled out a Machine Gun, shattering Booker's durable shield and grazing his arm. 

Booker fired his Burstgun and dove behind cover as his mind raced, so he had limited ammo. If he ran out of bullets, though, he could just use Vigors.

His thought process was interrupted as an RPG landed a few feet in front of him. Instinct took over as he combat rolled out of the way

""Are you fucking crazy?! Launching an explosive in an underwater city?!"" 

Jack was obviously not all there, preparing to finish off the madman. Just then, he heard an electronic beep and turned around, only to see that he had landed in front of an RPG turret. Jack instinctively launched a Security Bullseye at Booker, who used Possession against the machine, which short-circuited and burst into flame.

Jack, huh? That's why you're crazy as shit?"" Jack glared at him and summoned an Insect Swarm to put some distance between them. Booker swore as he was covered in dozens of burning stings, and called upon his Feast of Crows, who hungrily devoured the wasps. Jack, remembering the Bucking Bronco from earlier, sucking  Booker in a Cyclone Trap, mirthfully setting him ablaze with Incinerate, Booker screamed in agony as every atom in his body became white-hot. In his blind agony

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Back when Booker first bought Undertow, the clouds) and using it all at once. In Columbia, sucking moisture out of the air created a tidal wave. In Rapture, the water he was summoning came from the ocean all around him. All of these thoughts suddenly occurred to him as he was swept away by thousands on gallons of sea water. 

Booker watched in alarm as the massive metal doors automatically closed, only to realize Jack was trying to use Sonic Boom to repel the water. Booker could feel his lungs crying out for air when he suddenly had an idea. Using the last of his air, he used Possession on the door; sending them both into another room. He stayed on the ground, gasping for air for a few seconds. He was too weak to move, but he could hear Jack quickly regaining consciousness. Booker panicked, feeling himself drift dangerously close to unconsciousness. 

Both men were half-dead from effort and severely waterlogged, and eagerly aimed it at the Pinkerton's head. 

Booker saw this and strained himself to get up. Using every ounce of willpower, Booker used the last of his effort to wield Return to Sender, sending the bullets directly into Jack's chest. And with that, his vision went black.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When he woke up an hour later, and the effects of all of Jack's genetic modifications... Booker was in a lot of pain. Even Songbird hadn't come this close to killing him...

Still, listening for hushed sobbing. Eventually, he came across the little girl cowering in the corner. 

""Relax, and Booker tried not to react. ""Is the bad man gone?"" She asked fearfully. ""Uh... yeah, he's... gone."" Booker confirmed. ""Good,"" said the Little Sister, sweetly. ""Then he can't stop me from doing this!"" Before Booker could react, the girl jammed her 6-inch syringe into Booker's neck, draining the salts from his blood...

One sore thumb that sticks out as of late is people commenting on the GEoM's ability to hold back ""gods"" from another dimension. In my humble opinion, simply because ""demigod"" and ""god"" can mean completely different things for different settings.

Another thing I have found is that the terms ""demi-god"", ""cosmic being"" etc.. are used interchangeably by some people. An example would be is if somebody described Melkor as a fallen angel, while another describes him as a god of evil. While it serves as a simple way of description, I don't think we should rely on these lines when assessing power level. I think it these lines also go to show the ambiguity of the ""god"" terms.

Although gods don't often appear on this sub

So instead of using ""god"" term-statuses, that's cool and all for just a brief, sensational description. But that's also leaving out the fact that he is capable of being physically wounded, which sort of mutes the entire ""cosmic-god-deity of super-evil and death.""

**Edit 2/3**:  Ok, or, alternatively, encrypt it and store it in some portable device and shoot that device off somewhere random and secret that only he knows?  Here's what I think I should say.  First, I realized the possibility that Reed might destroy the data was a loose end but thought I would leave it unspecified. But now I see it's certainly best to stipulate that Reed won't destroy the data willingly. So we'll suppose he needs it to develop a cure for Alzheimer's that he's been working on in secret due to the data's militarily sensitive nature. If it got into the open, and just anyone got hold of it, there would be grave likelihood for a terrible ensuing weapons race. For that reason, and there would be no point in putting it somewhere where it could never be found, Batman will have some time to get in and steal it.  Now I think the right response is to just allow the possibility that Reed might destroy his original copy and hide another copy somewhere secret, he might attach it to a rocket or something similar

2) both combatants have been in this area for 9 months preparing for a fight

3) they will not have outside equipment or gadgets (meaning no perviously made suits for either of them) so if they want things

1370902009.0,1g2qan,The Case of Two Sherlocks,dahahawgy,40,7,12,"Note: Unmarked spoilers for both *Sherlock* and *Elementary* below

Another note: I do realize *Sherlock*'s immense popularity, so I'd hope to avoid the reactionary vitriol espoused by a lot of fans of each show out there on the wider internet. I guess just remember to keep it objective, is what I'm saying.

The setup: Benedict Cumberbatch's Holmes and Jonny Lee Miller's Holmes each happen upon a crime scene in their respective home bases. Interest immediately piqued.

B-Holmes's case involves a victim wearing a cheap red hoodie with the price tag still on. White male, observing the callouses on each of his hands and the granite on his left pinkie, B-Holmes deduces the victim, identified as a store clerk named Jebb, is left-handed, presumably unbeknownst to the killer, indicating a lack of closer relationship, implying exactly such a relationship.

Meanwhile, strange enough already for an indebted college girl out for a stroll, but there appears to be no sign of robbery. Several stab wounds to the abdomen, but not too much blood. J-Holmes points out the girl's lips, shaded with lipstick but ultimately somewhat ill-fitting with her skin color, given her otherwise impeccable fashion sense. Diagnosis? Discoloration via poison.

Each Sherlock is aided by his respective Watson. The game, and, in the end, link the crime to the true mastermind behind them both...the *literary* legend, Professor James Moriarty, whose goals are far bigger than the sum of these grisly murders.

Feel free to interpret the evidence how you like, etc. In the end, though, who is the superior match for the Napoleon of Crime?

The players:

B-Holmes has become something of a celebrity, to the point of recreating seemingly errant finger taps days later. Has been demonstrated to overlook certain things when in a state of great panic. Arguably the bigger asshole by far, immediately alienating most who come into contact with him. Of the two Sherlocks, he was shown to be far (*far*) quicker in deducing what he could about his version of Moriarty. His companion, John Watson, is a former army doctor who helps to counterbalance Sherlock's stubbornness and lack of social skills. Underrated by the in-universe media, he helps humanize and focus Sherlock in a way few others can.

J-Holmes regularly works with the local police department to put both one-time and spree killers behind bars on a weekly basis, such as phony credentials and illicit affairs. Consults the police out of an interest in the criminal element, but has many hobbies besides. Able to take in and process stimuli from a great number of sources simultaneously, as shown when he is able to repeat perfectly a soap opera's dialogue while taking in information from several other television sets at once. Recovering heroin addict, sober for over a year, though his past occasionally comes back to haunt him. Joan Watson is his former sober companion, and before that, she was instrumental in capturing their version of Moriarty.

Open ended questions occasionally are subject to this the worst, which is, in my opinion, a mistake.    When a person poses an open ended question with a fighter of their choice vs whoever you can come up with they aren't looking for someone that would make their character an Ant compared to your Boot.   They are looking for a ""worthy"" opponent.   Open ended scenarios give us a chance to engage multiple fights within a single comment section, opening up the  possibility of further posts to continue the discussion.

Use the DC Animated Universe. I've been watching Justice League (Unlimited) on netflix. Something I noticed? The DC Animated Universe uses significantly weaker characters.

The Titans have agreed to fight by the Roman’s side if they get all conquered territory of the Aztecian Gods. Hera after the death of her husband has given up her very soul to repair Kronos to avenge Zeus! Seeing that Olympus is no more and she has no hearth to guard Hestia herself has personally taken the burden of the sky to free Atlas and Thor to fight. Aphrodite has used all her charm and beauty to awaken Gaia from her slumber to aid in this fight though the effort has left her unconscious. Unfortunately Uranus could not be revived as his pieces had already been used to form other beings when he was first slain. Turns out the romans were right the Aztecs are right at their door the Titans and Asgardians were just freed only an hour ago and have had no time to recuperate after being imprisoned.

The p!Earths are past versions of Earth. They are:

* Earth

* Earth

* Earth

* Earth
* Earth
* Earth
* Earth
* Earth

* Earth

Earth 1914 leads the other p!Earths and provides technology. Movement between p!Earths is accomplished using two-dimensional gateways that range from less than two meters wide to over three kilometers wide and fifteen tall. The way these gateways work: a gate is comprised of a 2-dimensional geometric shape; the number of sides ranges from 3 (triangular) to infinity (circular). Gates with 3-12 sides are the most common. If Ælfric passes through gate A (which is aligned north-south along its width so that one flat side faces west, he will emerge in the west in another time; thus, Harold and Ælfric can walk toward each other, and emerge facing away from each other. This means that two armies can enter the same gate from different sides, effectively doubling a gate's transport capacity. Gates permit two-way travel. They can only transport through time, not space; so a gate located at Stonehenge will take people to Stonehenge X number of years ago/from now, and not London or Istanbul or Beijing. Due to the appearance of the gates, it might go unnoticed. However, it was sunny

Remember [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1egczd/10_of_my_elite_scifi_soldiers_vs_10_of_yours/)? Well, you can have some vehicles as well!

**RULES:**

**Most important rule: You don't get to argue with me over the rules. If I say you broke the rules

- You get 10 squad members, equipped with science-fiction style weaponry, armor and tools. 2 squad members are allowed to man a 1-person vehicle. [For example, the goliath from starcraft.](http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/45407/1478710-goliath_sc2_rend1.jpg). Any creature or machine that weighs over 500 kilograms on it's own counts as a vehicle. If it is intelligent enough to fight effectively without guidance, it also counts as a squad member.

- A retreat is a loss. Leaving the atmosphere counts as retreat.

- [Roflmoo scale](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1e87ba/tournament_stats_list_and_chart_template/) is used. Quantify the power of every uniquely equiped member of your squad and the two vehicles using this system. Do not make them so strong they reach or surpass rank 7 any part of this rating system

- Fights are 3 rounds, and one in an evactuated urban enviroment. In each case, atmosphere is breathable.

- **FULL** I will use [this](http://challonge.com/tournament/bracket_generator) tournament generator to generate the brackets.

- Fights are decided through debate and then a vote. Every participant votes

- You cannot change your squad's equipment between fights or rounds. Up until your first battle

**Tips:**

- There is no rule against jetpacks

- Keep in mind you and your opponents can use biochemical and energy weapons

- The range you're fighting at might not always be what you want it to be: Keep this in mind!

- You can't shoot what you cannot see: Cover

- Don't forget not everyone might use electronics

- Think outside the box: Have you never seen it before in science-fiction? *Perfect!*

**Rules:**

* The 2 characters picked can be from the same universe or 2 different universes. 

* They MUST compliment each other. Don't just pick Superman Prime and Sentry because they're the most powerful. Their powers or traits have to directly compliment the other character

* It would be preferred if the big picks are ignored for the purposes of this post. I can't stop you obviously but this should be a break from all the recurring big names in this sub in order to showcase the potential infinite power of 2 lesser known characters feeding off each other's powers/skills.

* The fight is welcome to take place in the original comment's arena of choice. If none is specified

* The fight can destroy the entire planet or universe but shouldn't compromise any character's morality. Personality is just as important as powers in any fight. 

* It's assumed that both characters agree to fight together for whatever reason

* The characters are welcome to any gear they would normally bring to a fight. If they're able to carry more in preparation for a big/difficult fight

**Bonus Round:** After each initial fight, you create a 3rd character with a power that compliments the duo even further. Your opponents then add their 3rd character. SIMPLE original characters encouraged! (To clarify : the 3rd character, if an original character, should have a fairly simple power/ability that compliments but doesn't overshadow the original duo.

1373946663.0,1ie1vc,Santa's Had Enough,vosqueej,31,3,8,"*Intro is optional

So a couple days ago I was visiting my uncle's house

Also bear in mind that I'll be quoting a lot of what he told me as directly as I can recall him saying it.

The Scenario At Its Simplest:

**Santa Claus vs. Mrs. Claus and roughly 13

The Teams in Detail:

**Team 1: Santa Claus**

*Santa- the big, going as far as saying ""they make crappy toys"" and similar things. He fired most of his elves because of this (hence why there's only about 13,000 now- at first we thought there was a billion elves but then we recounted) and so the remaining elves have decided to rebel. Santa will be going into combat with the intent to kill anyone who stands in his way, armed with the Force. No lightsaber, no reindeer, no sleigh, no potentially lethal toys. Just him, and the Force.*

**Team 2: The Mrs. and the Elves**

*Mrs. Claus has sided with the elves because she believes Santa was unjust in terminating the elves' work contract. She will be armed with a chainsaw. The elves all ""suck in fights"" however there is 13


Now this is clearly very one-sided as is

**Twist #1: You get to fight on the team of your choosing**

Yup

*You, you both can communicate to each other through sign language. Somehow you get pulled into this fight, and that's all we have to go on for now.*

**If you fight with Santa

On the other hand, nor do you have any superpowers/the Force. However, you do gain access to an infinite supply of silkworms to throw at Santa (the silkworms are unaffected by the Force). Two seconds after contact, the silkworms explode into fireworks. Upon killing Santa, he explodes into stale cookies and ""damp milk"" as it was described to me. Ten of your inchworms want to eat those cookies, and you have to feed them yourself.

**Twist #2: Mrs. Claus is actually dead (sort of)**

Turns out if you join Mrs. Claus' team, instantly killing her. At this time you gain access to her chainsaw to attack Santa with. However, *you must use it to melee Santa*, as he will decapitate you with it if you throw it. He can't control it if you're holding it. Keep in mind, **you must join Mrs. Claus' team for this to happen. If you join Santa, Mrs. Claus will not be instakilled and you can't take her chainsaw.**

**Twist #3: I don't even have a title for this one**

Your spouserilla is having an affair with your adopted gecko-child.

Yeah.



So now

2. After you've chosen your team

1. The post I most want to discuss is [Wallzo's Possible Battle Template Post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1hfthg/possible_battle_template/) He's done a great job of outlining a default for battle posts, because there's a lot of great information and guidelines to keep in mind.

2. Read the sidebar, the very first thing listed under the part that says ""IMPORTANT""? It's not that massive a deal, but come on. When a post or a comment is on-topic, what is the point of downvoting? We're all discussing the same things, and we all have the same interests. Even when we don't agree, we'd all be friends in real life. So chill. If no one disagreed with us, we would have no subreddit for these discussions. It's one thing to disagree, but to find the best answer and have fun doing it. This subreddit means nothing if every unpopular position gets buried. 

3. Lastly, please understand that I am not ignoring you, and I'm hoping to get through it all in the coming days. However, this does bring us into Tournament News.


##Tournament News


1. I really haven't gotten a lot done lately, so don't panic, but I have to say now that we may not make the December start date I originally hoped for. We'll see. I have always known that real life comes first, and since the Tournament Staff and I are all volunteers, we haven't all been free to coordinate or work on as much as some may have hoped. I won't say things *can't* be ready by the end of the year, but I believe it's irresponsible to maintain that release date at this time. For now, I will leave that date open to change

2. A large number of charts have just recently been added to the main [Tournament Fighters List](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1e870b/upgraded_tournament_fighters_list_work_in_progress/) by users
 * This is also a good chance to offer pictures for any Fighter's Image link. The best pictures will be included in the main charts. The Image link is supposed to show the proper version of the character and it's best if they look as awesome as possible. I try to find good ones and volunteers have found some great ones as well
 * If you want to try out for the Writing Staff, the faster the Tournament will go, but I need to be careful who I let in, because it's that much more difficult to organize everyone when there's a larger number. To be honest, I need to maintain a standard of talent and writing ability, as well as availability and dedication among the Tournament Staff. Please consider offering your talents as a Guest Writer instead of trying to become a Staff Member if you will not be able to stick with us for the long-term. For more information on either position, please don't hesitate to send me a message.
 * **Also, I have a backlog to take care of. In there are several charts made by several of the top contributors and they do not currently show up on the main chart. They will soon, but I'd hate for anyone to waste their time charting someone who's already been completed. **Ask me** if a fighter is complete before starting your own charts. Once they're made, post them one by one in the Tournament Fighters List post, with the others.

3. The Tournament Staff has two rough drafts done and ready to be worked on, which is taking up a little more time, lately. As for writing... more on that next.

1. I want to know what you, the Tournament is my largest project, but it's not the only one, and frankly, I have plenty of other ideas that I'd like to spend more time on. The Doomie Awards, more written non-tournament battles like the Terminator vs Xenomorph battle, and the Fictional Metals Reference chart have all suffered because I was devoting too much time to the Tournament alone. I'd like to balance my time a little better, I'd like to know what else you guys want to see. I will be sinking less of my time into the Tournament and using more time to actually enjoy this sub again. If you can think of any small projects that would be fun

Of course, let me know, and I'll see what I can do.

To elaborate on the examples in the title :-

**Spider-Man**: Nerd guy gets super powers and starts getting attention from girls. I mean really... what nerd doesn't wish they were bitten by a radioactive spider and as an added bonus of not getting cancer you get super powers. Your life changes and makes it so much more exciting but you still retain your nerd intellect.

**Batman**: Pretty obvious. You have more money than you can shake a stick at and you have stunning good looks to boot. You have the most elite and secret clubhouse under your mansion and have a butler to serve you and give you sage advice from time to time. Criminals and bad guys are inherently afraid of you because you are the Goddamned Batman!

**Superman**: A living god with no real weaknesses. You are fast, can see through walls, see far, hear better, shoot lasers from your eyes and blow cold air (Seriously how does that work?). Only weakness is that it sorta feel too boring now kinda like how it makes it hard to make a good Superman game without filling it with kryptonite everywhere and red sun lamps.

**Hulk**: Your rage incarnated. Ever feel angry? Of course you do. When you do don;t you sometimes feel as unstoppable as proportionate to your anger? What if you actually were? This fantasy is a constant for him and mostly an overused plot twist in JP anime. Bad guy does something and the hero is down and then he gets angry and gains more power enough to beat the bad guy in the most dramatic way with lots of screaming.

**Flash**: Everything is at a standstill for you. You move so fast you can get away and do anything you can think of. Nothing is out of your reach and you are untouchable.

**Punisher**: Extra! Ever read news about how poorly criminals treat others or watch a movie where the mob bullies that poor couple who just want to run their laundromat? What if you could [punish them with no consequences? What if you can show those assholes what if feels like to have someone judge their fate?

Rules. 

1. None of the other races alive in either universe are at war with each other but any tensions that were there before would still exist.
2. The reapers are now gone from mass effect and flood are gone from the halo universe.

4. The forerunners are at the height of their military strength and influence before they completely purged their military. The prometheans do not exist.

* Pick a weapon from the list.

* State how you would use it to survive the arena.

* Another commenter picks a different weapon and states BOTH how to survive the arena and how to defeat you.

* Reply back how it may not work so well as s/he planned.


*The area is a post apocalyptic setting much like in ""The Last of us"" where the buildings are in ruins and covered in vegetation. You two are the only LIVE inhabitants of the arena as the rest are populated with RE1 style zombies. You can find other makeshift weapons and transport to augment and supplement your own gear and powers but no guns.*

The weapons are :-

**Angry Birds Slingshot.** This device is lightweight and can magically summon the Angry Birds. The range is that of a normal child’s toy but the effects of the birds are potentially devastating. You can magically conjure up to :- 5 blue birds (splits to 3 and powerful enough to smash glass), 1 giant red bird (expands into the size of a large cannonball and has the same mass), 5 green birds (Boomerang effect), 3 white birds (The drop bombs) and 20 regular red birds that hit has hard as rocks.

You can psychically ‘tap’ them to release their special abilities. Also they make their signature sounds after flung.



**Link’s Master Sword** and boomerang. The Master Sword will shoot fireballs only when the user is at perfect health. The user is required to make a large/heavy arching slash to shoot a fireball 40 cm in diameter. Once the user becomes hurt or very hungry due to not eating for a day s/he will be unable to shoot fireballs. The user must then heal the wounds and eat to regain strength in order to be able to use the sword’s special attack again. The boomerang is actually just a normal high quality and tough boomerang. Master Sword is enchanted and unbreakable. In addition using the sword to cut grass will sometimes give Hearts which can be eaten like food (Not heal wounds); on average you get 1 heart (as much nourishment as a cheeseburger) every ‘front lawns’ worth of grass you cut.



**Soul Edge**



**Gambit’s energy charge ability**

Takes 2 seconds to charge an item.

You are given 6 full decks of playing cards and an aluminum little league bat which you can charge with your ability. The impacts are 3X damage of your normal swing.


**Dragonborn Shouts**

[Unrelenting Force](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Unrelenting_Force)

[Whirlwind Spirit](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Whirlwind_Sprint)

[Kyne's Peace](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Kyne%27s_Peace)

[Fire Breath](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Fire_Breath)

[Storm Call](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Storm_Call)



**Sword of Omens from Thundercats**, Thunder, Thundercats... HOOOOOOO!!!!!!"" and is also lightweight and durable due to magic and alien tech. In addition it grants you 'Sight Beyond Sight' which allows you to see far away and obstructed areas (But you still gotta aim). This sword also comes with the claw gauntlet that fires out its claws up to 12 feet away and can latch onto trees or rocks to assist in climbing.


**Dagger of Time** 5 charges (MAX). Refillable through killing zombies. Usable as a weapon and durable. You can rewind time after death as it is linked to your soul. Rewinds time up to 5 minutes.

*Winner of the battle gets a free chicken dinner from the loser if they ever meet up IRL. :)*

And since I started the [short story](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1d1uaj/how_would_batman_win_against_scenario_x/) I figured I should just finish it based on the comments and suggestions from commentators.

**Batman** pulls up a screen from his computer to patch into the local news network. Images from a helicopter on what looks like some urban battlefield set in some country at war if not for the iconic sight of Wayne Towers in the picture. The frantic reporter on scene comments on the situation.

""What we have here is the national guard fighting some sort of superhuman in the middle of Gotham. Police and the fire department are currently working to evacuate the area."" a loud zoom can be heard over the broadcast

As the pilots take aim and let fly their missiles the Accelerator notices them and readies with a mad smile on his face

The missiles are launched from the jets and as soon as they reach within the vector fields they are carefully deflected into the tanks who were creating a perimeter.

A second round of missiles inbound but not aimed directly at the Accelerator but the ground area around him this time.

""Think this is the first time people have tried that?"" Smirks the demi-god teenager.

As the missiles collide into the cement the boy is engulfed in flames.

""There you have it folks! This new threat has been dealt with without the help from capes and... oh dear lord! ZOOM IN CHAD!!!""

As the cameraman zooms into the area as the smoke and debris has cleared we can now visibly see that the Accelerator unharmed and smiling after that devastating attack.

""Computer! Match facial recognition with all know files starting with Asia."" Bruce yells.

""No matches found worldwide."" responds the computer.

""Might be another alien."" stands up from his seat and walks off to another section of the Batcave

""Including the national guard

""No time to explain Alfred but just know that they are now doing more harm than good."" Batman leaps into the Batwing and it exits out the underground waterways and emerges out the east river.

""Uhh hey army guys!"" yells Robin to the man in uniform who looks like he's in charge

""Are you FUCKING KIDDING ME?!?!? Someone get this kid out of here!"" the general in charge orders some of his men to escort Robin off the premises.

""Whoa whoa whoa! No need to get all touchy-feely man. We just want to help and we need you out of the way."" protest Robin.

""Ohh of all the arrogant gall! This isn't some guy with an umbrella or a guy with half his face burned off so unless you have Superman or the Green Lantern inbound I don't have anything else to say to you!""

As the general's men move to grab onto the boy wonder the agile young acrobat easily dodges the attempts and uses his grappling hook to escape to a nearby rooftop. he mumbles under his breath

""Hmph! Nuisance capes!"" he picks up his radio receiver and begins to bark more orders

""General!"" a voice from behind the shadows.

""Jesus Christ

""... What is your plan of action?""

""Well since conventional weapons seem to just bounce off him like he's mutha-fucking Superman I got permission to bring in our special project! Wheel her in boys!""

Multiple vehicles start rolling in a large tarped object as the men pull off the tarp it is revealed to be ...

""A railgun?"" exclaims Batman in his head. A railgun that is mobile on land is rare

""Beauty isn't she?"" the general says as he admires the 20 ton weapon

Batman sees the look on the general's face and understands that talking to him would be fruitless and instead heads to the battle via rooftops.

""[This reminds me of my younger days!]"" the white haired boys proclaims as he adjust the vectors of gravity under the tank to flip it

""Somethings off about this..."" Batman presses some buttons on his wrist, ""Reduce playback speed by 99.5%"" the video slows down enough to actually see how the bullets bounce off Accelerator's body, ""Computer, calculate ricochet angles of bullets' original trajectory."" as the computer outlines the the normal course of bullets Batman finds that the bullets are definitely NOT ricocheting off. His experience with watching how bullets and other weapons bounce off Superman has been ingrained into his subconscious and he could immediately tell that the way bullets bounce off this boy was odd.

Batman presses more buttons on his wrist and then to his earpiece

""Wha...? Batman? This is a secure channel! Get off it!""

""No time! Just stop charging the weapon! He isn't just resistant to weapons

""Well let's see him reflect this! FIRE!""

""Noooooo!!!"" but Bruce's protest are in vain as the weapon is at full charge and it shoots directly at the Accelerator

The white haired demo-god holds out his hand

The general

""Not yet

""Men... fall back. Leave it to the Batman.""

Batman uses his cape to glide towards the Accelerator.

Accelerator doesn't even notice the silent shadowy figure from above until it lands near him. he turn his head and is met with a sight that brings fear to criminals... and he laughs! ""[Buahhahahah! What is that? Are you a vampire-man?]""

""He's Japanese?"" Batman thinks as he understands the boy's language

""[Ehh? Finally someone who speaks Japanese! But why should I stand down just because you dress funny?]"" the Accelerator takes on the stance that shows arrogance and contempt

*Now here we can easily just have Batman talk to Accelerator and just get him home. But that feels like such a cop out so I'm going to throw a monkey wrench in here so we can get to the actual beating.**

""Watch out Batman!"" screams the boy wonder as he throws some grenades and bladed projectiles at the Accelerator. Of course the projectiles simply have no effect on the Accelerator and the grenades are just smoke pellets and the most they do is provide a momentary inconvenience.

""[Kahk! What is this? Some trap?]""

""Robin! What are you doing? Get out of here!""

""Not this time Batman! I'm taking a piece of the action now."" Damien tries to land a glided kick on the Accelerator but is easily countered and falls flat on the floor.

Now agitated the Accelerator gives a swift kick to Robin's ribs and by manipulating Newton's 3rd law the kick comes off as more than double the force of a normal kick breaking at least one rib in the Boy Wonder.

""Robin!"" swiftly Batman rushes to Damien and scoops him up and uses his remote control on his wrist to call in the Batwing. He places Robin into the cockpit and send him on his way. After the jet leaves he turns back to the demi-god standing behind him staring daggers into at Batman.

""[How dare you!]"" the Accelerator manipulates the gravity beneath his feet and he does his namesake and he accelerates towards the Batman giving him a massive punch!

With no time to react properly to the extremely quick attack all he can do is use his cape's Kevlar to soften the blow and roll with the Herculean punch. Counter attacking he throws a batarang at the Accelerator's feet and activates it. Sonic batarang.

Horrible mind numbing sonics echo through the air and would normally knock out most people unless equipped with the filters batman has in his mask. But the white haired boy just stands there looking very angry.

""[Ahh that really hurt! Luckily I can filter sound into my personal shield. But you can't hear me can you?]"" Accelerator standing triumphantly in the face of Batman.

But Batman can understand what he is saying. Lip reading is useful and now he has another important clue. And he drops a flashbang to escape and buy time.

""[Argh! All you are doing is annoying me you weirdo!]"" stunned by the light the Accelerator rages.

""Alfred! Is Damien back at the Batcave?""

""Yes

""Let him! And ask him to take the Batwing again and bring weapons coded of SCE09061 and JBC00001!""

""Sir? JBC00001? Isn't that...?""

""Yes I know Alfred. No time to explain just have Damien send them. Over and out.""

The steadfast butler grumbles

Batman now using his stealth to evade the superhuman teenager and some batarangs to distract and divide his attention waits for the drops he needs.

""[Hey hey! Where did you go you weirdo in that stupid costume?]"" Accelerator now smashing buildings down to their framework attempting to find the Batman

""Westerners? Is he unsure as to where he is exactly? What  is this academy city?"" soon after one of the communicators alerts.

""Batman

""Drop the 'SCE' 30 yards behind me. I need to prepare and time this just right.""

""Roger

Batman scans the area in NVG mode

""Yeah

""Yes

""Say what now?""

Before Robin gets an answer Batman glides down toward his enemy, ""Let's hope Crane's formula works aerosolized.""

The Accelerator notices the small bomb at his feet but pays it no heed as no weapon can hurt him. It doesn't explode but actually merely discharges a thick cloud all over him. As a natural instinct he inhales partial breaths of the gas before using his powers to alter wind currents and pushes the gas clouds away, ""[YOU!!!]"" as he sees not Batman but the only person to have  actually beaten him. The 'Imagine Breaker' (Illusion killer) a.k.a. [Touma]( http://toarumajutsunoindex.wikia.com/wiki/Kamijou_Touma) !

""Robin

""[This time I will break you for sure!]"" and he dashes with augmented speed towards his phantom and leaps into the air

If Batman had reacted just half a second too late the bones in his body would have been broken. He leaps back and twist mid jump and launches a grappling hook to a nearby building and reels himself to safety.

Accelerator not discouraged gives chase with a giants leap but Batman remains just out of reach again.

Batman runs the calculations in his head, ""NOW!""

The dome drops towards the two and Batman releases 6 more bombs behind him and leaps just out of the dome covering area. The dome covers the frenzied Accelerator and the bombs explode releasing sleep gas.

The Accelerator instinctively tries to blow away the gas but to no avail in such an enclosed space. One breath in his panic causes him to feel dizzy.

Then he tries to punch through the metal dome and finds it much tougher than expected. Another breath which causes him to feel sleepy and the Scarecrow gas side effects of increased  heart rate help speed his metabolism more.

One last ditch effort is to adjust the vectors under he dome to lift it but finds that too is a long term plan as it the dome was welded shut into the ground. One last breath before he finally passes out.

Batman pours a liquid around the base of the dome all round its circumference

The dome now easily lifts off the ground and reveals a knocked out Accelerator. Batman checks for a pulse and when he finds one he removes a can from his belt  and sprays the contents onto the boy's face,False,self,t5_2s599,False,,Marvel1,t3_1dawvn

S.H.I.E.L.D. has an interest in using the DNA of these pokemon creatures for super soldier research. They send a task force to gain blood samples from some of the most powerful (dead or alive)

The Elite Four emerge to defend their Arena. They are not bound by the rules of standard pokemon fighting here, so assume they can each safely control one more than their weaker counterpart. If Lance can control 5 at once, Agatha can control 4, Bruno 3, Lorelai 2.)

The Avengers must subdue or kill all pokemon

---

##Elite Four: 

**Lorelei**, 51 Cloyster, 52 Slowbro, 54 Jynx, and 54 Lapras

**Bruno**, 53 Hitmonchan, 53 Litmonlee, 54 Onix, and 56 Machamp

**Agatha**, 54 Golbat, 53 Haunter, 56 Arbok, and 58 Gengar

**Lance**, 56 Dragonair (x2), 60 Aerodactyl, 62 Dragonite

##Avengers:

*(Since we're using the movie version

**Captain America**, poisons, and fatigue, exceptional battle strategist. Equipped with a vibranium-adamantium shield that can block any attack.

**Iron Man**

**Thor**, hammer, arrogance.

**Black Widow**, ninja moves, S.H.I.E.L.D. tech.

**Hawkeye**, overall great fighter.

**Hulk**, who can move a mountain with one hand. This is the one that has some control over himself. Think the version that knows to save New York, but still might punch Thor through a wall for no reason.

---

What is the outcome

##New Scenario Info

Since they share this world, we can guess they are fairly distant, and so they wouldn't have too much familiarity. They know about each other but not much. S.H.I.E.L.D. must have just recently found them, and must not have any yet. They probably saw some in action and decided they needed to act before another power did.

S.H.I.E.L.D. determines the risk is too great to wait for more intel, just to be safe.
I'd say... three days of prep time for S.H.I.E.L.D.. Enough to account for reaction time and threat assessment, Widow, and Hawkeye are all more or less constantly-present S.H.I.E.L.D. assets, but Tony and Thor are a little more difficult to get a hold of.

Let's say the Avengers have the element of surprise, mutant-like animals with a variety of unknown abilities. They know these are highly skilled beasts with highly skilled trainers.

The Elite Four only have a few minutes to prepare, and all their pokemon are fully rested. 

They see the hellicarrier in the distance, so they have an idea of who they are and what they're capable of, but no specifics. Tony, of course, is very well-known worldwide, as is Cap. Hulk surely made the global news a few times. Hawkeye and Widow have the advantage of relative anonymity, and thus wouldn't be known at all by the E4.

3. Ender's goal is to wipe out Artemis in his own home. Artemis has any tools that his home already has, Ender gets a squad of 20 moderate soliders. Will Ender be able to overcome Artemis? Each side has 30 minutes prep time.

4. There is no penalty for avoiding combat for an extended period of time. Hiding and/or playing dead could be valid strategies

5. Each athlete will be deposited in the arena regardless of their own will to fight, leadership ability, tactical expertise etc., should all be taken into account. Alliances are allowed.

For the third year a Zombie Apocalypse happens and you lose a member. You pick how he dies. 

For the last year a little civilization starts and Aliens come and take over and civil war starts between the humans. You pick the member of your team to die. 

Only rule is no god characters. 

My team: 1. The Joker. He would be the first to die. He would be the character that kinda betrays us sometimes but only because he thinks that Batman or Superman is gonna save the world. But He's wrong and dies like a fool. 

2. Kenny from South Park. He was very loyal from the beginning and is the leader of the group until you came along. He dies and leaves you with the group.

3. Saeko Busujima from Highschool of the Dead. She hates you with a passion for becoming leader in Kenny's place. But soon respects you. She starts to fall in love with you and makes love to you before her death. She dies from a stroke. Her death still haunts you till this day.. 

4. Doom Guy from Doom is the last person to die and dies from saving you and the rest of the group from the various war going on. 

5. Captain Falcon is field leader and is responsible for getting food and other various items. 

6. Last but not least Michael Jackson. I originally had Fleetway's Super Sonic but decided that MJ would be a funny but great choice. His moves would be from moonwalker the game


EDIT: I just wanna clarify some things. OP characters aren't bad but I must request that you not use them. The reason being is that characters like Superman, exciting, and will guarantee survival. So I have to request that you guys kill the OP characters if you must use them. But that's a request and you don't have to do what I say. I'm gonna you guys some rules for Goku and Superman if you have to use these specific characters.

Okay, 7-point system. I really don't know how to implement a new one, since it would involve editing over 130 charts, submitted by... I think there's seven of us. Still, I wanted to at least put the scale out there so we can work on it, and if we can perfect it, then I'll figure out a way to edit all the charts. So, 0-10 scale. The rough draft is below. Tell me what you think




__________________________________________________________

##Possible rules/changes

 * I was thinking of rounding to the nearest point and writing specifics in the Specials section of each character's chart. This allows for more accurate ratings and fewer problems with the absurd ranges we have to use.

 * Rule 2: I don't think there are any more rules.

**Blood Gulch Crew:** 

- *Reds:* Sarge, Donut, and Lopez. 

- *Blues:* Church (who can switch between Robot Soldier Body, Tucker, Caboose, Tex, Washington, Sister, and Sheila.

The 501st is sent to attack the Reds and Blues in Blood Gulch. They can enter the box canyon in small numbers through the caves and also by a single Low Altitude Assault Infantry Carrier that drops off 30 troopers in the center of the canyon every hour. 

The Blood Gulch crew gets any weapon and vehicle that has ever appeared/been used in the entire 11 season run--and with the ability to be used in similar web-series manner as well as whatever function in the Halo games.

So very generally Godzilla was a living fossil dinosaur who was mutated by the radiation from the atomic bombs and various nuclear testing in the 1940s-1950s. He grew to massive size

Godzilla movies have certain 'ages' or generations in the same manner as comics. Just as there was a golden/silver age Batman, and his various size and abilities he has in each respective time period.

There's the classical Showa Age Godzilla: This is Godzilla from the original 1954 movie all the way to 1975 in ""Terror of MechaGodzilla."" This Godzilla (save for the first two films) is a little campier

**[Showa Godzilla:](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3I5VFc4QIIA/Te0itaMg6dI/AAAAAAAAA8Q/od4fcfVTZi4/s400/Godzilla_biography.jpg)** is about 50 meters (165 feet) tall. He has atomic breath

Then there's the Heisei Age which is the late 1980s-1990s. This Godzilla has the most popular design (we use it as our flair here) one people most commonly refer to in match-ups in this sub. Additionally

**[Heisei Godzilla:](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54632/1545684-968132_godzilla_super.jpg)** 100 meters (330 feet) tall, has super regeneration, and can absorb radiation and energy from defeated foes/allies for his own benefit. 

The Millenium Age (2000-2005) had a bunch of one-shot standalone continuity Godzilla movies

**[Godzilla Generation 1, has an atomic ray, super regenetive power, razor spines unleash and intense amount of heat while charging his nuclear blast, and can unleash a blast of nuclear radiation from within his body. 

**[Godzilla Generation 3:](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l0zhfhOsFy1qzr8nao1_1280.png)** 65 meters (215 feet) tall, can absorb defeated enemy energy for regeneration or to power up an even stronger atomic blast. Possibly a [slow-acting] regenerative ability, and may be immortal. 

**[Godzilla Generation 5:](http://images.wikia.com/godzilla/images/a/a2/Godzilla-final-wars.jpg)** This Godzilla is *the* strongest incarnation of the atomic dinosaur yet and because his film [*Godzilla: Final Wars*] was a celebration of all things Godzilla, and Millenium] of the kaiju. 

He is 100 meters (330 feet) tall, and can discharge a blast of nuclear energy to those in direct contact with him. He also seems to have some of that kung-fu skill the Showa Godzilla had, and is also the most slender, fastest, and agile [Japanese] Godzilla yet, being able to run and jump great distances and heights. 


* * *

**Weaknesses**

Due to his super-regenerative ability, even besides certain, specific weaknesses he can still get very hurt with enough [insanely intense] damage (though he will just often recover very quickly). 

**Showa Godzilla:** The original Godzilla was defeated by a device called the ""Oxygen Destroyer, but it is highly effective against him. 

**Heisei Godzilla:** After showing nearly no weaknesses throughout his entire run, a super-charged and super-powered monster in its prime and strongest form, who is invincible before his internal body temperature reaches 1200 degrees and he implodes/explodes. 

**Millenium Godzilla 1, though at one point they tried to put him in a black hole to move him [didn't work], and another time destroy him with an abosulte-zero canon [also didn't work]. 

**Millenium Godzilla 3:** No specific weaknesses. After taking on three kaiju single-handedly and the Japanese armed forces, insinuating that Godzilla was [slowly] recovering. 

**Millenium Godzilla 5:** No specific weaknesses. He was frozen once and kept dormant under a bunch of glaciers in Antarctica for a few years

Now I read the TMNT comics the original (I'm on issue 10) and Donatello is not really like he is in the comics. So decided that we are gonna use Animated series counterparts

Rule 1. No prep time
turtles in the sewers after just defeating Killer Croc but they are not tired at all and are ready to fight. 

Rule 2. Barbara Gorden aka Batgirl is a cripple and will be serving as Oracle in this fight. Basically giving support to the Bat Family fighting the turtles. Donatello will serve the same as Oracle in the fight. Donatello will be at the lair

Rule 3. I guess this is not a rule but I just wanna educate people who are quick to say the Turtles will lose. (It's your decision on who you think would win)  The Turtles are really good at fighting with no prep time. From just reading the comics they seem really fantastic at fighting aliens

REAL Rule 3. I guess we can say to the death. But it will be in three encounters with turtles that they decide to execute one another. The First they spar a little

Rule 4. The Turtles have all their basic equipment swords, and smoke pellets. I don't know all of the Ninja Turtles equipment but that is what we are gonna use. The Family will have their basic equipment. Bladed Batarangs, Bo Staff, escrima sticks, explosive batarangs, rolling explosives, and Smoke Pellets.

**Round 1**

Blue Beetle and Ironman first meet with no prior knowledge of each other. The Scarab identifies Ironman as a serious threat

Fight takes places in a populated city but neither is in proximity to call on their allies.

**Round 2**

After the initial fight, gets to work on a suit to counter the Beetle. He doesn't have enough time to create an entirely new suit, but can adapt one of his current suits. Blue Beetle's mission is also logging a tremendous amount of battle time, taking big steps towards having him and the Scarab in sync. What suit does Ironman use? What new Scarab ability does Beetle come back knowing after fighting for a week straight? Who Would Win?

Fight is in the same city as round 1.

**Round 3**

Years pass. Ironman now knows about Blue Beetle and the Scarab well enough through their fights to devise an entirely new suit devoted to it. Jaime has nearly mastered the Scarab's abilities and has come close to completely overriding the Reach orders built in. At this point

The fight starts in Stark Tower

1367525188.0,1dkm5r,[Meta] Lets talk range!,Leefan,26,10,6,"In a fight to the death environment can be a big factor. One we tend to ignore unfortunately. Because if you put two people up against each other that fight differently(grapple fighter VS standing/boxing fighter)

I purpose a system or rating on range

I purpose a 6 zones/sets of range. Here is my idea

**1)** At the very most a foot and half away from each other, knees, biting, and wrestling on the ground would be most useful. (So a boxer or someone who does Isshinryu would prob not be at their best here, but someone who wrestles or does MMA, or an animal that doesn't require a pounce would do great here.)

**2)** At the most a leg and a half distance from one another. So this is where volleys of good punches, and if you put say an MMA fighter in here they would probably try to close the distance to get into zone one, while a traditional martial artist or boxer would probably try and keep them back or try retreating gradually to stay in zone 2.

**3)** About 100 feet away is the max to zone 3. The idea I have is beyond this range shotguns, and crossbows are ineffective. This is where a lot of lower tier superheros are most effective. (For instance a lot of Naruto ninjas, One piece characters, Bleach characters, and lower level DC and marvel heroes like Static Shock or whatever, would be at their best. They would probably eventually advance to zones 1 and 2, or distance out to zone 4 though.)

 **4)** This range goes up to about 3 miles. **Beyond** this range, because he has heat vision, and the speed to enter and exit this range easily. 

**5)** This is the kind of range that countries fight at. (North Korea VS USA) It is where tanks

**6)** This is like god range. It is included for insurance purposes. It is like if superman flew into a blue sun and stayed there for months and was able to laser-vision to kill people across the galaxy or some crazy shit. Or if god himself wanted to kill you. Or if we wanted to talk range on Kira's deathnote.

-Both are exceptional at stealthy combat but Nightcrawler has the advantage insomuch as his mutation literally blends him with shadows. However, is likely more resourceful with distraction and misdirection.

-The setting helps both fighters. Gambit by giving him a variety of random objects (trashcans, etc.) and hallways in adjacent buildings to duck into that Nightcrawler may not be comfortable teleporting into suddenly. Nightcrawler by giving him lots of open space, surrounding vertical surfaces and shadows.

So in this question I will assume Batman wins and save you all the trouble.

BUT... you have to play out the rest of the scenario and tell me how Batman wins in the end. Your objective is to make it as interesting and believable as possible.

*In other words... continue this story...*


**Batman** sits at his computer within the Batcave scanning the monitors for any activity with an annoyed scowl on his face.

Alfred steps in with a tray of food towards Bruce

""I'm not hungry Alfred.""

The esteemed butler sets the tray in front of of lifelong friend and responsibility, don't you?""

""I know Alfred! In my head and every scenario I think through I understand full well how important I am to the team. But every time something like this happens it just reminds me that no matter what I do I just feel as if they leave me out because I have no powers!""

Alfred taken aback by the short outburst but he understands. No matter how disciplined he is

But before Alfred can give some sage advice the alarm rings. Finally trouble arrives...

**The Accelerator** [http://myanimelist.net/character/13917/Accelerator] exits a wormhole and lands in Gotham city. Confused and unsure where he is he ask, ""[Where am I?]"" in Japanese.

The stranger turns around and reveals he has clown makeup on and carrying an automatic weapon

""[English]"" Accelerator thinks as he notices that accompanying the joker gang member are others just like him and also armed to the teeth. He peers across them down the street and notices people with makeup on but with different patterns but a common theme

The white haired teenager pushes aside the joker gang members with ease and walks down the street towards the Two-Face gang. The contempt on his face and the utter disrespect to the gang members enraged both sides.

""Muther-*&amp;%^er!"" screams on man and both sides immediately open fire on the lone boy and as quickly as the fight starts it abruptly ends as each bullet fired reflects perfectly off his personal 'vector' shield and hits every gang member on both sides. Luckly none of the shots are lethal.

Accelerator not even flinching at the sight uses his smart phone and and opens up Google maps. He locates the nearest police station and proceeds to 'fly there by manipulating the vectors around him.

Figuring that his bets bet to get back to Academy City is to contact the local authorities and demand transport back there. He opens the doors of the station and yells in his best English

""Now hold on here son! You can't just barge in here and demand anything!"" an officer protest and tries to put his hands on Accelerator to calm him down but is forcefully repelled but the shield triggering the other officers in the station to...

""He's a power! Stop him!"" calls one and the others follow suit and readying their guns.

Accelerator sighs

Rookie cop

Like the gang war this escalates just as quickly despite the protest of the boy the officers open fire and the same happens but this time he isn't so lucky and there were more fatalities added to the first.

""You idiots! Do you not know who I am?"" screams the Accelerator. His power had just killed people... not clones created in a lab but actual people who have families to mourn them.

""Freeze! H..hands behind your head! N..n.. now!"" another officer aims a shotgun at him

Not even hearing the policewoman he flees.

Accelerator shaking and looking at his hands imagining all the blood there is on them for killing actual innocents now his mind starts to crumble

He stands up and feels the wind currents around him interacting with his shield. He adjust his personal shield to block out all sound so he can think clearly and comes to the conclusion

Manipulating the wind currents around him at first creates a small tornado like effect. The police open fire but the attempts are useless as the reflecting effect is still active.

The winds are getting heavier now and converging into a small ball above Accelerator's head as sparks of plasma strike at the officers and their cars and it demonstrates how outclassed they are.

A few frantic phone calls later through the proper channels and the national guard is alerted and soon a small army is inbound for Gotham city. And this alerts Batman of the dire situation with little to no backup for the rest of the Justice League.

Second huge thing is another one I have to apologize for- the [Tournament Test Match](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/18owxh/tournament_test_match_detailsrequest/) I promised you. Well, but it is a big priority for me and a post will be happening soon so you can help decide on the conditions of the matches. (Location, special rules, etc.)

In order to help move things along a little, but as more and more people sign on, I'd hate to lose track and neglect anyone. If you want to volunteer, let me know, and I'll start a list somehow. If you want to be a public Staff Member, let me know in the comments and we can sort things out in that comment's cascade. If you want to stay out of the spotlight, feel free to private message me anytime. 

Again, information, and encouragement you've provided. April should see a lot more progress than March, especially if we can get the new ratings done soon.

---

Ah

Staff works with me on the Tournament. Jobs include fact checking, critiquing rough draft fights, deciding on arena types, writing rules, and things of that nature. Really, the most common thing I'll do is ask for your advice. Whenever I get stuck on something, get some info wrong, I'll need to know the people willing to pick up the slack. I'll run a match by you once or twice, and then I'll finalize it and ""publish"" the fight. 

For example, so your knowledge and input trumps any research I can do. This is essential to getting these fights right, and a diversity of thought processes will lead to less predictable, less biased, and more entertaining fights.

Once the Tournament actually starts, that I am certain will play large roles later on.

All of this is purely for as long as you are having fun with it. If you don't want a task I offer you, we can work around it. Nothing will ever be strict, and I am no one's boss. I'm organizing everything, but I am not in charge. I want this to be a community effort and I want people to be involved because they enjoy it. 

I guess the best way to say it is that the Tournament Staff will consist of those among us who are as dedicated to this project and it's success as I am. Those willing to spend a lot of free time working on this because they truly enjoy it. If at any time it starts to feel like a chore

If you want to be anonymous overall
