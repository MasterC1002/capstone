1365800932.0,1c8cjz,I had sex with some uncooked pizza dough and it was AWESOME. Casually ask me anything. (NSFW story and pictures),ImKennedy,1503,327,552,"I did it.

After yesterday's response to [my question in r/sex](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1c5wdt/will_i_get_a_yeast_infection_from_having_sex_with/)

I'm having some Internet problems again


&gt;I was laying in bed before I had to head to work. I don't normally think about pizza dough when I'm not at work
&gt;
&gt;I cleaned myself up and went to work. I go in the back door. My boss isn't there, knowing that I'd need to smuggle the dough ball home. I didn't ever mean to fuck the dough at work. That would be unsanitary. If anyone found out, I'd probably be fired. So I get to work, trying not to think about what I've hidden in my jacket. But it's too much for me. I start to get an erection. I grab my jacket and go into the washroom. 
&gt;
&gt;I take off my pants and open up the bag. I poke a hole in the dough and massage it with my hands. I'm rock hard now. I open up the condom and put it on, but considering I had just gotten off an hour prior to that, I was satisfied. 
&gt;
&gt;I realize that I don't know what to do with the dough. It weighs about a pound and a half
&gt;
&gt;For a few hours after that, talking to customers, taking orders. No one that I talked to knew that I had fucked a pizza dough just before talking to them. Someone came in who was getting pizza for a birthday party, someone came in wanting a job, someone came in to talk about how good our pizzas always were. None of them knew. It made me feel dirty, and kind of turned on. 
&gt;
&gt;At the end of my shift I ran home into my bedroom. I grabbed the dough out of my pocket while looking for a condom. I didn't have any more. So I went without. Lying on the bed

So yeah

Edit 1: I have better internet now (I think) so I'll be able to answer questions quicker. I'm just updating the story right now and uploading the pictures.

Edit 2: I just put the full story up. I'm working on the pictures now. I""m having a bit of trouble getting them off my phone and onto the computer. But they'll be up soon.

Edit 3: [Here are the pictures.](http://imgur.com/a/t0diP#0) It's 2 very artistic shots. One of the dough

Also, so when I write about what happened, I write it creatively. But every bit of it is 100% true!

Edit 4: Just to clarify, or [/r/gonewild](/r/gonewild) things. The pictures that I uploaded are not those. I'd be up for that. I'm just going to ask my boyfriend first, to make sure that he'd be comfortable with it.

Edit 5: I've loved answering talking to everyone in these past couple days. It's been a lot of fun. The thread has pretty much died off now

Well the stories goes like this. I was apart of Arbitrary Day 2013 but since I'm in the middle of a move I used my parents address. My parents knew that a package would be coming and just put it to the side for me. When the package arrived my mother saw my username on it and asked why the hell I would have anarchist in it and that it could come back and bite me in the ass one day. I responded with the username would be the least of my worries. Later over dinner we started to talk about NSA and privacy to which my parents said ""If you have done nothing wrong you have nothing to hide"". I said bull shit

tl;dr My mother found out my username and is likely reading this.

1376098480.0,1k2cir,I'm currently at a wedding that turned into a divorce party,ZenSilby,611,117,107,"I've been in the wedding field for over 8 years and this is a first for me. The wedding is now a divorce party for the groom's side of the family. More people are showing up every minute.

EDIT 1... Well this took off more than I thought it would. I am going off the grid

EDIT 2... Wow

**FINAL STORY**

Potential Bride and Groom come in wanting a ceremony and reception. They already are married and are interesting in more of a renewal of vows because they never had a ceremony, at 10 days out) except the final one, where the bride and groom show up to pay the remaining balance which was still owed. They dropped a large sum of money on Friday to keep the wedding a reality because they still had an open balance. Our rule is all events have to be paid in full on the day of your last details meeting or it's cancelled.  

Monday comes around and we get a call from Groom in hysterics saying his buddies wife died overseas (military related) and he is flying out for the funeral and needs to cancel the wedding. Mind you, so it was more of a OMG we are so sorry and tried to see if he wanted to postpone it but he said no.  

We get a call Thursday from bride &amp; groom, nor had we ordered the food, linen, etc... for this one). 

Event day comes and the start time is 5pm for the cocktail hour and grand entrance for B&amp;G is 6.  The formal room and sculptured garden sits like a ghost town short of my penguin dressed staff, and lonely display of appetizers. Around 545 groom shows up in the most awkward starts to an event I've ever seen. It was like one of those scenes from an ol timey saloon when the bad guy walks in and the music stops while everyone looks around dumbfoundedly. Groom had bust in with about 15 cronies rocking casual wear in the midst of a formal setting carrying a case of beer (even though they had paid for an open bar) stating directly to my waitstaff ""You guys get on your phones and text people, tell them to come to the party"". After about 15 seconds of awkwardness everyone went in motion with music and hand passed appetizers. My staff was confused beyond words. 

When we asked him when bride would be arriving both he and some others looked at us like we said the devils name and shot us some looks. I then peeked at his hand and he was definitely not wearing his wedding ring. Although he tried to reach Project X levels of party hardness, apparently even footraces took place.  I let my staff relax a bit and have fun (to an extent) with the groom and the guests. Once I saw the ridiculousness of penguins hand serving appetizers to drunk people in shorts I toned down the formality regulations for the evening. My staff even made solo cup runs for the groom and partook in beer pong (my staff had to use water cups)

Unfortunately we did NOT find out any specific details of *why* the marriage ended or if in fact there was any friend at all.  All we still know to this point is that something awful happened within 24 hours to shut a marriage down. Groom made the most of it though, shit... we have 2 weddings today and a memorial tomorrow followed by 2 luncheons on Monday. Life moves forward. We as a staff decided to believe that the friend was actually the secret lover of the groom and that's why he absolutely needed to go out to see him. Bride got suspicious so groom said it can wait and everything went back on. Right before the event the groom confessed, as the groom said fuck it... let's have a party. 

The biggest monkey wrench of this whole situation is the invitations. We don't now why they were never sent

Easily the strangest event I've ever seen in over 8 years of dealing with weddings and banquets",,t5_2sxwp,1376164048.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/1k2cir/im_currently_at_a_wedding_that_turned_into_a/

A lot of people wanted to hear more about Jamie Foxx and DiCaprio. One of the richest guys in the world is a Malaysian who is an absolute batshit crazy party animal and a huge gambler. The casino I worked at actually flew in the Pussycat Dolls for one of his wild birthday parties and of course outfits him with private gaming rooms complete with bottles of Johnny Walker Blue that they go through like water. Well I start my shift and whoa, so now I see why they are “friends” with this guy.
 
You also got to imagine the scene, why not? I don’t have dirt on either of those two though, sorry, they were the only ones not going back and forth to the rooms with the hookers, but Foxx made a really cool move.

The next morning Foxx comes pulling up in a beautiful brand new decked out orange Camaro. My buddy that I worked with, the guy starts bitching that it isn’t a BMW, my buddy wanted to fucking strangle the guy.

Junior Seau is probably the guy that sticks out the most, probably the biggest player as an athlete. I’ll remember one weekend in particular… this guy was losing his ass, most I have ever seen him lose in one weekend. Nothing is going right for him and we see his girl (not sure who she was maybe ex-wife?? Short hot blonde) giving him hell all through the casino. 

I was on what we call a floor walk (I was in the eye at this time) which is basically just walking the casino incognito looking for cheats etc… mainly just an excuse to get out of the room, losing his ass, getting berated by his girl… he fucking takes the time, stops, puts on a huge smile and is all “Hey Buddy! How’s it going”… I know that seems like a little thing, but knowing what he was going through at the time, it said a lot.

Well Junior went on to lose his ass all that weekend, I think that might have been a suicide attempt. Of course everyone was like no fucking way, that guy was all-pro for so many years, he always seems happy and is smiling, he has a big restaurant, etc… it must have just been an accident. Of course now hindsight is 20/20... but it is very easy to see how no one could see it coming, dude always seemed happy and was nice to everyone. I’m not saying I think his reasons were financial or because of gambling

Just some more quick tidbits or I will be here all day and sorry if this isn’t as interesting as was expected

Stallone… one of the shyest celebs I think I have ever seen. I’m not sure what the whole arrangement is with him, but I used to see both Stallone and Willis in there a lot… never saw Arnold. Stallone would always go straight to the back of the sports book with the current owner and seemed to want to stay as incognito as much as possible, seemed polite enough, but never wanted to talk with anybody and I got the feeling it was more out of timidity than being a jerk… odd to see such a big personality seem so shy. 

Willis on the other hand

Holy crap, but it was still funny as shit to see.

They filmed a lot of movies at Planet Hollywood including “21”. Ashton and Cameron used to play blackjack at the live games in between takes, lol, it was like mama bear always had to keep an eye on her cub. Ashton seemed like a nice dude, seemed kinda nerdy. Amazing how different real personas are, Cameron seemed more like a soccer mom in real life than the wild chick she is in the movies.

Billy Gibbons from ZZ Top is cool as shit to everyone

Clarence Beeks from Trading Places, no one really noticed him. Nice enough guy, nothing special good or bad.

Between 2000 and 2004 I was a ""Fem Starlet"". Most of those types of sites don't exist anymore but there was a time when there were many

Nothing nude or pornographic was allowed on the site but the more risque and suggestive the clothing/outfits

The head of the network eventually fled his home country after unsuccessfully fighting the government's attempt to shut down his (MANY) sites in court. As far as I know he's still at large. No

Keep in mind that I never met that jerk or interacted with him in any way. My step-dad was simply one of hundreds (thousands?) of people who set up his own account there-- starring me as his ""model"". I was nine when we started and 14 when he left.

For those of you inclined to defend ""child modeling"" like this as an art form that should be protected as free speech

That's why I get so frustrated when people joke about child pornography or make excuses for pedophiles who seek out CP. If there wasn't a market for such things nobody would create it. But there is a market

**To anyone who would like an update on my nocturnal shower sock situation:** I will be taking another shower around 9:30 or 10:00 US EST.  I will answer questions after that about the socks on my feet, and about the singing/humming of The Star-Spangled Banner.

**9:21 PM US EST** All right guys

**9:40 PM US EST** PICTURES COMING SOON. 

**9:45 PM US EST** PICTURES HAVE ARRIVED.

I took a shower with socks:

Due to what I call extreme bad luck, fundamentally.

Why an AMA?

-the random chance that some stranger out there has some sort of magical answer that'll solve my problems without being forced into prostitution

-I've lived an extremely interesting life (survived traumatic childhood up to and including having a loaded shotgun held in my face by my mother, painting, drawing, etc). Moreover, I love to talk and tell stories. I won't hide the fact (anymore) that I'm in a really bad spot in life right now due to extreme bad luck, but this serves the purpose of helping me forget my troubles for a little bit. At the very least, I'll have entertained myself enough to smile a bit

-Reddit is a big place. There's probably someone going through something similar who'll help put The Big Picture in perspective for me- a Bad Luck Network of sorts-, or at the very least, share interesting stories with me and by proxy, all of us. It won't make my problems magically go away, but at least it'll distract me from reality long enough to get into a good mood...maybe.

**EDIT** I'm about to head out for now. Despite all the BS I'm going through, I can have some fun tonight. I don't plan on abandoning this AMA though, so by all means, keep asking away, and I'll answer them when I get a chance. Also posted a link to some of my art-related stuff for the curious.

**EDIT 2** I plan on leaving this AMA perpetually open (even if I do one on IAmA, though (5/5/13) I might not be answering too much- friend who's wifi we were using is in and out today, and to be honest, I got very drunk last night (it WAS my birthday...), so I'm very hungover. I spent a great deal of time hugging the toilet since 2am...eesh.) 

A few of the kinder amongst you have asked about making donations, and I won't be able to properly do it today as my internet, yeah, being weird, on top of being sick, but if I do set it up, I'll edit it into here. But I don't want to be that jerk that everyone thinks is just soliticing money on Reddit, I can't really open a new one

**EDIT 4** Still spotty internet, an update. Hopefully I can pull something off; I'm gonna be talking to the power company to negotiate in the next couple of days.

I will be moving to China soon to be an English teacher. While I'm there I hope to meet an older Chinese lady who has a lot of money. Now you might be thinking: why go to China to meet a rich woman? Several reasons:

* China has [1, and 63,500 people with $16 million or more.
* 40% of Chinese millionaires are female
* Chinese female millionaires are more likely to be self-made millionaires
* Chinese millionaires are an average of 39 years old
* China does not value career women. Google ""leftover women"". Most men do not want to date a woman over 27
* White men generally get a lot of interest from women in China.

Trying to explain how he died is so much more complicating than a car accident or some sort of sickness like cancer. I'm hoping this AmA will be a good way to reference those around me. 

Here's a brief overview of that day: It was around 5am in 2009 that my dad had come home from work to find the bathroom door locked and the venting fan on. After getting no response from knocking on the door
The police and coroner came to assess the scene. From the markings on his neck from the belt he was able to tell us that my brother passed out from choking and the belt slipped up suffocating him to death. Because he passed out he was unable to move back up and this killed him. 
We found out a few hours later from his best friend he had talked about trying this out because it was something he heard others do before. The irony of this is the fact he had another friend whose brother had died doing the exactly thing

Ultimately the thing that makes this whole type of death hard to explain is not making it come off as bad. My brother died masturbating while choking himself and there's no way of making that statement sound decent. I've spent the last 4 years telling people he accidentally  was strangled to death in our home

He did it. 

It started off as any normal day would have for a dough like me. A proud working Mexican fella gathered all the ingredients he found necessary to make a batch of the foundation for a soon to be freshly-cooked pizza. This however, my stunning appearance and front row seat to the glitz and glamour of a pizza dough model were unknowingly to be my downfall. It was around the time I was placed near the aisle way of the freezer when I saw him. A current employee of the restaurant, ImKenndy. Generally, this guy hadn't raised any concern. Sure he was an oddball, but no one ever could have guessed what psychotic actions he was capable of. He gracefully said hello to the chef as the freezer door was slowly closed shut, but not before ImKenndy threw me the look. It was a look of lust, desire, the freezer door creaked open. It was him. Soon after secluding himself with me in the freezer he whiped out some plastic and I was stuffed in it. I tried to scream for help but it was too late. I was sealed-up in a zip lock bag with what appeared to be a rubber candy wrapper. Seconds turned into minutes, soaking in what I thought was to be the misery and regret of his actions. This was proven wrong as the day became night and what seemed like eternity became much worse. After being rushed home,False

* Disassociative Identity Disorder means that the person ""blanks out"" for a while, it might have a completely different accent.  Most ""entities"" have a completely unique identity, and you can talk to them and hold conversations.  The person doesn't remember what happens while they're blacked out, all they know is that time seems to have skipped forward and they might be in a different place than they were a moment ago.
* We started dating when I was in college
* At the peak
* We spent years researching causes of the disorder and treatment
* While I won't reveal personal or identifying information

I'm going to call my girlfriend Jane.  Rather... I'm going to call her ""real"" personality Jane.  I need a way to distinguish.

Curious about multiple personalities, I will not be discussing the actual trauma that caused Jane's personalities to manifest.  That's something personal that isn't really my business to go posting on the internet.

Some background: I was raised by an amateur apologist, graduated from BYU, Married in the Temple, served as Elder's Quorum president twice (Local leadership).

**Why I left**

There is a lot to it, and quell some of the niggling details that bothered me. 3 1/2 years of research later, the percentage chance that the church was true was so low, I had to reject it. Reddit was significantly helpful in my understanding of truth and working through logical quandaries.

**Mitt Romney**

 I am a republican
I will answer questions about things he ducks/avoids and why he does it from a member perspective.

**But you left the church

This is likely to be the most commonly said thing by active members of the church at me, David Whitmer and others do not suddenly become liars and false witnesses simply because they left.

Instead of accusing me of being biased, my preferences, and my intent yourself.

I'm not sure how to start off as I don't have much/don't know what to type up. I'm currently a 20yr old student trying to get though Uni. I do not expect to pass.

I basically live in the present with almost no knowledge of who I am/what I am. I write what has happened to me in the past in my notebook (Basically it's become me.) My earliest memory is vague and is probably ever changing and I have no idea if it even happened

To me

The way I currently try to remember things is to think from an anchor point or follow logic/think logically.

I don't have many friends as people get insulted when I forget things about them

Recently that point has been strengthened as I reconnected with an old friend from HS

The reason I am posting this to casualiama is I have limited proof of my condition (only referral letters from GP to hospitals which have been ignored.) and I simply have lost all hope to get this fixed.

TL;DR - Student who has Amnesia currently attempting to study and lives with basically no support except some family with no future.

My folks adopted him when he was six or seven. (I'm one year older.) As kids, make his bed, and sleep on the covers. So he wouldn't have to do it in the morning.

Roy used to steal $20 bills from my mom's purse, and eat it all. At once.

He used to steal lunch meat from the fridge and keep it under his pillow. For days. (We always wondered why his room smelled bad.)

I know all these stories just make him sound strange

One of his favorite games was to take a sharp or heavy object (knife, whatever) and ""pretend"" to throw it at someone. But he would also ""pretend"" it slipped out of his hand and actually throw it at the person.

But that's not the most fucked up part: After he'd do this,"" because he knew that's what he was supposed to say.

1329524683.0,pumfq,I am the only child of a Compulsive Hoarder. Photos included in the post. Ask Me Anything.,Child_of_Hoarder,149,19,55,"I would like to begin this AMA by saying that I made a new account to keep this separate from my real identity. I am not doing this to brag or to show off

Without further delay, we slept in there, somewhere. Yes, the bunkbed is covered too. We moved around in the house by stepping on the trash and furniture.

I realize that some of them are quite unbelievable, and I can't believe I thought this was normal for a large portion of my childhood.

**How did it start?**

It starts soon after my mother moves into a new home. At first, some trash not thrown away fast enough, a new habit of collecting dishes or, for my mother, yarn. Before long, it becomes too bothersome to try to manage, and even taking out the trash seems to make no difference. Eventually houses become uninhabitable. Long after they're unsafe to live in, who never married my mother because of her hoarding

**Is this the worst of it?**

No. At times, she had almost a hundred birds when I was a baby, causing me numerous health problems. At another, I remember us having more than fourteen dogs. The local animal shelter has taken a number in the past due to neglect. She seems incapable of understanding the responsibilities of a pet owner. This particular house shown in the pictures at one point had dog fecal matter everywhere in the kitchen, a dead ferret in that cage you can see in one photo, and dead dogs littering the backyard.

**Why didn't you run? Tell the police?**

Children of hoarders rarely have the insight to get help when they're young. They either, or they are afraid of being separated from their family by child services. Due to the fear of the second, my mother did not allow me to have friends over (for obvious reasons), and only allowed me to go over to friends' homes when I was older and already realized that her behavior was not normal.

**What does she say about it?**

She does not acknowledge that she has a problem. When confronted, threatening to kick me out of the house when I'm home visiting (she lives in a new home now where the cycle is already beginning again). To excuse her ""slight clutter,"" she makes excuses like, ""Oh, I was just depressed *then*."" Another usual phrase is, ""I'm just in a funk right now."" Another, ""I've just been really busy recently. I'll clean everything up soon.""

She does not listen if I try to help her stop buying more things

**How does this happen? Why doesn't she just stop?**

It's a mental illness. It's not just being a messy person. However, one cannot *find* things that you need, so you go out and buy another. This means that eventually you have 10 items littering the home rather than one. Also, sales are a terrible thing. In order to save money, my mother has bought many things she'll ""maybe need later,"" or ""can never have enough of"" even if she has no room for such items. As you can see in the photos, she hoards yarn. She buys more and more

**Have you experienced any problems as a result of this?**

I have had extensive therapy after leaving home to deal with my issues. I have problems with being ""too clean, and save my money instead due to only buying what is necessary. I'm working on that, but honestly I enjoy minimal living. I grew up poor, as you can probably tell from the photos, so I'm used to making ends meet.

When I lived with her, and junk food. My primary drink was gatorade, while chips and pizza made up my diet most days. I was never fat, but I had numerous malnutrition problems. I'm much healthier now that I'm in control of my diet.

Relations with my mother are, and I worry, selfishly, about what I'll do when I have to ""clean up"" after her eventual death. In order to live a healthier life away from the mess, I rarely come home to visit. Perhaps once every 3 years.

I can't think of any other really obvious things, but they thought I was lying. Anyway, AMA.

Below is the verbatim text of the original post:

Lately on reddit the topic seems to be rape everywhere I look. Often times discussions back and forth about the rape of males follows. I don’t normally think about my own experiences but they’ve been on mind because of this lately and I’ve been tempted so many times when someone posts something about male rape but I just didn’t know how to drop my own experiences into conversation. So here are my two stories in their entirety. I don’t even know where to post them and I'm sorry if IAmA isn't appropriate. I will not verify my identity ever

The first event occurred my sophomore year in high school. Not a true rape by the legal definition I guess

At the time I lived in a midwestern state shaped vaguely like a pan, but I won grand prize and shortly thereafter passed out. The last thing I remember was being dragged into a back bedroom and dropped on the floor, the lights went out and so did I.

An unknown length of time later I realized I was in pain

I only knew her indirectly; she was the wife of the older brother of the friend who told me about the party. I will name her Virginia Trottinghorse, about a hand taller than I was and easily twice my weight, and she had my pants pulled down and was lying on top of me with one hand shoved down my underwear grabbing me there very tightly. Her breath was rank with cigarettes and beer as she grunted in my ear. Wordless mostly but occasionally she would throw in an insult or threat and she kept demanding that I get hard for her. “Come on you pussy, get it up for me.” When I struggled against her she would put her weight down with her arm on my neck and choke me, the world swimming I would lay still and then she’d let up and resume grinding on me. After what felt like forever the door swung open and someone turned on the light, but even exposed she still didn’t stop.

My savior was a guy I’ll name Derrin, my pants down and tears running down my face, and him just looking down at me pathetically. Over the din outside the room I could hear Virginia announcing to everyone that I was a pussy who couldn’t get it up, and then the laughter, the humiliating laughter from everyone outside. To this day I don’t know which made me feel worse her groping me or the laughter.

I quietly pulled my pants up while Derrin watched over me

The second rape happened about 10 years after that. I’m going to be intentionally vague about a lot of details here because they would be very revealing. I was in the armed forces and stationed very far away from home. Everything was going great and I was having the time of my life. I had met and fell madly in love with a foreign girl and we were married just that year. It was a very emotional relationship, that and the kind of jealousy that makes normally jealous people feel uncomfortable.

The spats we had with increasing frequency often led to the destruction of things I valued. A stereo here, I wish he felt about himself the way I do now. At the time I thought I knew what I was doing, my mother was wrong about her and I was going to make this work; until one rainy day in April when my eyes were opened wide.

This fight was different, and to be honest I don’t recall the fighting was about, we may have not even known at the time. In the end it seemed to be burning out the same as it always did. She was throwing me out, it was over. I was on my knees begging her to stop and to forgive me, to take me back. And that’s when she said it. “If you want me to forgive you, you will have to fuck me.” To which she then added that I must not enjoy it. That’s when this train left the station for crazy town.

I asked her what she was talking about and she ignored me and took off her robe, waiting for me to do what she asked. And so I did, and it was the worst thing I’ve ever done. She wouldn’t make eye contact with me but if I looked away she would scream in my face to look, and then her eyes would drift back to the wall and she made sounds of disgust and ordered me to just finish already and what was taking me so long? I started crying and said I couldn’t do it, I couldn’t finish like this and then she really lashed out. Insults and curses, telling me I was always a lousy lover, that I was too small to please her, I got so angry with her and what she was saying and she saw it on my face. For a second I think she was concerned that she was losing control of the situation

Like the cliché, we didn’t fight anymore but then we didn’t really talk or interact either. I discreetly bought a plane ticket, and then on the day of my flight told her I had a job offer in the states and would be in touch when I got set up. She didn’t even put up a token argument. I took next to nothing with me, a backpack with a change of clothes and a few other small trinkets, boarded the train and other than mailing divorce paperwork a few years later never spoke with her again.

And that’s it, but brief and disorienting. The worst part is the shame, waves and waves of it and it just goes on and on until you can’t remember who you were before it came. Even years later they just spring up and bury you. For those of you who know what I mean, I’m sorry.",,False,,False,t3_y1wp4

I'm a 21 years old, that I eventually made meta and asked his opinions of his stories and lives. I started to talk with him more and more, and eventually he was someone I spoke to regularly in my mind, and who I pictured with me at school and home, as just a cool friend.

Around the age of 17 I had a fit of paranoia and worry, lost jobs, got new jobs that sucked, lost jobs again, dealt with family members passing) but otherwise stayed silent, knowing what I thought of him.

Basically


When I first moved in he told me that he was redoing the house and that he was going to be renting it out as a location. If I was ok with that, and on top of that I get a cool roommate.


Alex was a cool cat. He didn't party much and played computer games nonstop. So he was always available and worked a lot. I've seen him with the hottest chicks in porn.


While hanging out with Alex I also got to know 2 of the big directors of the business, but plenty of others. I also did a little bit of rough editing for them. Rough editing is the grunt work and they paid me very well in cash by the hour. Mainly because they knew me, they trusted me in their house on their machines, and I did an ok job.

I was a fine in school until grade 3, apparently, I made small improvements but I basically went back and forth until I could legally exit school in grade 10 when I was sixteen. I could still not read or write any better than a 9 year old. I got worse over the years.

For about six years I worked as a cleaner and janitor for a small firm in the city but even that was hard not being able to read properly. It was a small business with links to the special education unit my brother and I were in

I had been chatting with her for a solid 2 minutes by this point and slowly started to edge closer to her and eventually had my arms around her. Total time from crossing the road to this point would be less than 2.5 minutes.
  
After a quick quick snog the decision was made to go elsewhere and get more comfortable
  
That's my tale

I am thirty five now, this is my story",TheJerk666,94,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/1hau60/i_am_adopted_and_i_met_my_biological_parents_and/, but they weren't that great either. All I knew was my biological mother was 17 

My life was normal, and had a loving family since that day. I always knew somehow that I would meet my bio parents but as I turned 21 it did seem to be a fading thought. 
I was living in South Pasadena with a girl I was with. We had met in northern California but she was pursuing a modeling career in LA and I followed her down. One day I got a call from my Dad saying that he had a letter from my birth father. He was asking me if I wanted it. So I says ""Yeah send it to me."" A few days later I had the letter in my hand. It was short, I'd love to talk to you, the end."" 

He had run into my Biomom one day in a train station about the time I was 14. She grabbed him by the throat and said if he ever contacted me she was to be the first to know. It was a pretty sour experience for her. She was a young rebellious teenager growing up in the suburbs of Washington DC in the 70's with 4 siblings and a dad in federal law enforcement. Her parents were also devout Christians, that is to say he acted like a dick, but I understand that it was a hard situation to be in. He sat Biomom down in his office next to Biodad and scolded them for about twenty minutes and then told her she had to ""take care of it, and that he wouldn't support the baby."" At that moment Biomom was looking for Biodad to stand up for her but he just slouched and she lost all respect for him. 

She tells me I went to a Led Zeppelin concert when she was 6&amp;1/2 months, she gave me away to another family. A gift to everybody.

Fast forward 22 years later. Biodad feeling like the window was closing contacts the adoption agency. He figured when 21 happened that if I was searching for him it would have happened by then. So he asks the agency what he can do. They tell him that he can send a letter to my parents through the agency. Because of the laws involved we had to get in touch with each other through a third party website. That way the agency wasn't directly facilitating the reunion.It started off with a few phone calls and before I knew it I was on my way to Dulles Airport in Virginia to meet my Biological father.




Pause......now just soak that in for a minute. I grew up with out a genetic identity. Nobody looked like me. We didn't waive any flags. My friends families all had flags, but we never had any of that nationalism growing up. So for the first time I was about to go meet a guy who would look like me and who would represent all of out father before him. He ended looking like my older brother. It was awesome. He was like an older brother too. He was 41 I think, single, successful player in the DC area. He showed me around his life, we went back to his apartment and he started telling me I needed to call Biomom. Now this wasn't the first time he had said it, he told me the story earlier about her choking him in the train station. He also told me that when he contacted me he called her parents (my grandparents) trying to get a hold of her. When he told them his name they hung up. This really freaked me out because I didn't think I could handle rejection at that point. He swore up and down that they wouldn't.

Anyways he convinces me to do it and 2 minutes later I am talking to my aunt for the first time ever. I say ""Hi,pa,what? really? (freak out) OMG!!! Crying me, Crying her, small chat who I am, more crying, here talk to your grandmother, this is BioSon"" ""crying

We got in her minvan and drove to her house where I met my 13 year old sister. I remember walking up to her and telling her I was her older brother and she just gave me a big hug. It melted my heart

When news spread that I had come back the whole Irish family rolled out. The next morning I woke up at 8am to about 35 people waiting to meet me. Half adults and half kids. Everybody always knew about me. It wasn't a big secret
 
Since then I see Biomom once or twice a year. It used to be more but I have a family of my own now. When I first got back I ran and tracked down my best friend who came from a proud Irish family. I burst in and proclaimed ""guess what, and I walked both my mothers down the aisle, one on each arm. It was sweet. The kids are getting older and they all alternate coming out here in the summer. We have a tradition of taking them on a local canoeing trip every time they come. We all talk once or twice a week, and my son is lucky enough to have met his great grandparents several times. The last time was a few months ago for their 60th anniversary and family reunion. Great Grandma died two weeks after that. Great Grand pa or G-man as he likes to be called is hanging in their but is sure to be reunited with is love soon.

As for Biodad
Well

Me and a girl (let's call her Rachel) became fast friends through many things in common. Mostly what we were fans of (such as shows, and to her, I was the only person she could talk to about all of that.

Through that we got very close to the point of pretty much telling each other everything. I wouldn't say we were the best of friends (because, we didn't run in each other's friend circles and we didn't see each other that much. Also meaning, we didn't really mention one another to our own friends. It was like having someone to talk to, but not have to commit to as much.

Rachel had a past of paranoia that everyone somehow would leave her. She was always afraid that one day she would have no friends and I sympathized for her. As any friend would, I'm here for you. I love you""

I had no idea she would take the ""I love you"" in a different way than I meant it. She asked me ""Do you really?"". I was confused,  I loved her as a good friend.

That wasn't what she thought I meant at all. 

Rachel asked me if we could date. I got so flustered. I was an awkward girl (still am). I didn't know she was a lesbian

I didn't know what to do...so I said yes. I regretted it every single day, I didn't mean it that way. I never wanted to date you, I'm not even a lesbian. I'm straight"".

And with Rachel's paranoia

It ended 4 months later. She broke up with me. I had never felt so free in my entire life. Of course I regret it. It's been almost 6 years and I still regret it. I never tell people about this

Ask me anything!

Hey, unless I go purposely poke at the last few stitches, where it irritates a little.

Being cut has been a lot different from being uncut. My head is now fully exposed all the time

Even though I shower every day (And I'm not really that active of a person), especially underneath the foreskin. Not enough to actually think ""Oh god this is awful"", but just a minor smell. Now, there's none.

Related to the above, it really starts to chafe and it feels like my bits are suffocating down there. I think every person with boy bits knows how uncomfortable it is when your balls stick to your leg. Well, it's the same feeling, just with the foreskin. This is one of the reasons that I decided to get cut, actually.

Overall, or because it's sticking and I have to unstick it. Now, it sits comfy and it doesn't bother me anymore.

Also

As for the part everyone was curious about, and on the head itself. It actually hurt quite a bit to get the job done, but 5 days was just getting a little bit long!

There were a few times since then, and cut masturbation is like a smooth paved road that isn't as steep, but the ending is stronger, and the sensation is entirely different. The slight tension of the skin drawn tight when erect changes the way stimulation feels, I think. Just like how lightly running your fingers over your palm is a different sensation than pushing hard and doing the same thing, that's pretty much how cut/uncut differs.

Of course the inevitable question is, it's different. It's not objectively better or worse, it's a completely different sensation, and I just prefer it like this over how it feels when uncut.

I dated a girl for 18 months.  Throughout that relationship I did work for her family's business, ""Why are we even together?""  I got tired of hearing it, so I would say, ""OK, we are done.""  She would then hurt herself, scratching herself with her nails or keys.  This would pull me back to take care of her and we would get back together.  It truly was a vicious cycle.

Her parents owned a remodeling company, I worked retail.  I told her I was looking for a second job and she told me that she spoke with her father and the other partner, and said that they wanted to hire me to do design work.  They would pay me $20/hr plus a 10% commission on whatever I sold/project I worked on.

I did this work for about 8 months without being paid, they didn't have checks, they wanted to pay me in cash but didn't have enough on hand, etc.

Like a sap, I get paid. 

About a month after that we get into a huge fight.  I was going to sleep at my house because I was not sleeping well at hers because of her new dog.  Another one of those, we are done.""  She goes into the kitchen and cuts herself with a chef's knife, badly.  I rush in and grab her arm to put pressure on it, call 911, and wait for them to arrive.  She goes to the ER, my friend comes and gets me and takes me home.

Her father reaches out to me to ask what happened, being unaware that I was lied to, tells him.  After, he tells me that she was not a partner and did work there.  At most she answered the phone for a week or so.  He asks what kind of work I did and I show him, I save everything (good thing too).  He tells me that I need to go get the money and give it back, I for some reason tell him that I will see what I can do.  I talk to my good friend, lawyer, despite the jobs were fake, would be impossible.

My friend tells me to not respond and to write up the entire history of my working relationship with my now ex

I even went as far as to block her and her parent’s numbers

I have not heard from them since.  However, and text in case they ever do sue me.

1366852248.0,1d1ux3,I am a male victim of rape AMA,trev1776,85,14,26,"Hello

Let me start by saying that I have never gone to the police or authorities with any of these cases.  Until recently I have never disclosed any of this information, so the storytelling techniques may not all be there that would normally be there in a well-practiced story.

The first rape story takes place in early 2006.  I do not remember the exact date just a few things about it.  I remember it being a Friday.  Earlier that day I had gotten a test back in school, Karen.  Karen and I met in Kindergarten but had only really become close friends since about 6th grade.  Karen and I didn’t go to the same middle school but we would still talk to each other often, using AIM or calling each other on the phone.  But I’m digressing now.

Karen went to bed that night promising that we would talk the next day.  She had to go to bed earlier than normal because she had a doctor’s early the next morning.  As such I was left alone, and my friend and I were in competition for the highest grade.  So when an assignment required 3 pages of notes we would sometimes write 25-40 pages!  I remember getting 680/250 points on a packet once because of this. (She got 682 on that assignment and ended up winning the competition.  I think she got a 257% in the class and I ended with a 241%).  But at the time I wasn’t worried about my overall grade just that particular F.

It was around 1AM

I was cold.

I didn’t put on a jacket

I should mention that I have done this walk dozens of times.  I was used to the random noises and I didn’t really get startled anymore.  That being said, once in sparring and once in breaking.  Both of these were at a tournament in Las Vegas.)

However the man was much bigger than I was, so trying to shake him off could’ve been bad, so I sorta had to let him drag me.  We went into an alley and he threw me down, before I could move he had my face in the ground, and well I think you can guess what happened from here and I won’t go into any details.

When he was finished he left me there crying and screaming for help.  No help ever came, both of which would be empty at 1:30 in the morning.  I eventually picked myself up, rubbed my sore and abused ass and walked home.  No one knew and I wasn’t going to tell anyone.

I didn’t  really know how to react to this.  All I really knew was that I didn’t want to talk to anybody, or talk to my friends.  I eventually broke out of this, slowly.  I don’t think anybody that I was close to during that period of my life really knew.  I guess eventually I just shoved the memory to the back of my brain and kinda forgot about it.  I went on living my life.  

I may decide to reveal the other two stories later.  I feel deeply responsible for both of the incidents though I will answer any questions if they do come up.

AMA [NSFW],Bigshow281,95,28,41,"I have been secretly crossdressing in the privacy of my own bedroom my entire life for the purpose of sexual gratification and never told anyone about it...until yesterday when I told my wife. My wife is a bi-sexual 27 yo and I am a heterosexual 33 yo and we will both answer your questions. The reason why my wife and I want to do this AMA is because I have lived with my fetish/hobby for about 25 years in complete guilt and shame and I want to help men who live in shame doing this and also provide some perspective to ladies that might have a man that has this hobby. If we can help one man out there feel less shameful for his crossdressing hobby and if we can help one woman to be more open and understanding of their man's hobby then this AMA is worth the time and effort to me.

I very much enjoy being a man

I was so scared to tell her but because I knew how open minded she was sexually, but she wanted to see my secret collection. She told me the idea of seeing me in ladies' undies turned her on and made her lady bits tingle. She told me this was new territory for her and she wasn't sure if she would like it but even if she didn't, she would encourage me to continue crossdressing even if she wasn't into it because she wanted me to do something that makes me happy.

So I took a leap of faith and went into my closet and pulled out my backpack full of my pretties. I have collected secretly over time some nice silky bras, thigh high stockings, and camisoles. I took each item out one by one and handed them to her. My face was red with shame. She would slowly and gently feel the soft feel of the satin on each item I handed to her while looking at me with her beautiful loving and understanding eyes. I could tell she was getting turned on. I was finally gaining courage so I asked her if she wanted me to try some of them on for her, she said yes. So I got naked and slipped into my favorite pair of satin panties and pulled them up. Next, I put on a pair of white thigh high stay-up lace top white opaque stockings and then a long purple satin and lace nightie. I turned around so she can see the panties riding up my ass and how the stockings looked on my legs. She was biting her lip, clearly very very aroused.

She whispered and gestured for me to lay down next to her, and stockings. She loved feeling my balls and growing hardon through my silky panties. Soon, she put on my other pair of stockings and my other nightie and we began passionately making out like two lesbian lovers. She blew me and then we had hot sex while both of us were dressed up head to toe in sexy silky ladies lingerie. It was the most erotic, liberating, and intimate sexual experience of my entire life.

She says I opened a new door for her

I had subsequent secret lesbian relationships - always invalidating my love for these women by publicly having boyfriends throughout. I married a fantastic guy and made beautiful babies with him. While I never outright disliked sex with men, but that was long after I recognized men didn't turn me on. I love men, I just don't want to be with one.

I had no good reason for denying my gay-ness. My family is liberal and awesome. My friends couldn't care less. I'm not at all religious and typically don't give a shit what strangers think. I suffocated my love of women because it was easier to be with men. The roles were clear there. Public affection was almost expected

But here are the consequences. I lied to people who love me. I used people and was selfishly unfair to both the men and women I loved. I knew all of this and convinced myself that I was heartless. When I did divorce and start dating women openly, when I'm finally where I need to be. 

There is a stigma for me even in the gay community. ""Real"" lesbians (the kind that were bullied in high school and college for being out) constantly doubt my gayness and tell me I must be bi-sexual. I'm instantly considered disingenuous when I argue for gay rights -- somewhat fair considering the farce of my marriage. I have no excuse for how I lived

It minimalizes the struggle to say ""just be yourself, and trusting that -- when it matters -- good people around you want the opportunity to support you. I realized this later than I should have, and offended them with my lie. 

Tl;dr: denial and lies can be harder than being gay. Find the courage to trust yourself and others. And then be someone they can trust.

Everyone is crazy about opals here. Most people can't wait 'till they're sixteen so they can get their mining license. Just the prospect of being lucky enough to strike gold - err, and digging in anticipation, hoping that this'll be the day you get rich. People also say that using dynamite is some of the best fun you'll have. Though recently, they made it so that you had to have a background check before getting a dynamite licence, which got some people annoyed.

Speaking of which, there's actually about 3 000. One of the census collector people were even chased out of someone's house with a shovel. Some people don't really like all these official records about them.

Quite a few films have been shot here. There's this one about aliens (I forgot the name)

Everyone around here knows each other. They say that ""If someone farts in the main street, so he went and got a huge loan from the bank in Adelaide (something like 20 grand), and had a big party. Instead of a grave stone, he has a beer keg, and whenever someone visits his grave, they add a beer bottle to the collection. On the flip side, whenever there's a birth in town

Half of the buildings here are underground. The main reason is so that people can escape the heat. I myself live in a normal house on land. Mum always said ""if we're supposed to live underground, even though they're only a family of four. People also like to dig out swimming pools that never get finished, and just seem to get bigger and bigger.

Proof: http://imgur.com/YwHMBDC The top part says ""battery

So here's what happened: My friends and I decided that maybe it would be a cool idea to start playing Pathfinder (a version of Dungeons and Dragons), alone, go to my local board games shop, buy the game and some dice, and I wait in the bus station for a bus that's 10 minutes away.

Then, obviously in his 30's. He comes up to me, while I'm holding a bunch of stuff in both hands, and whacks me right in the left temple. That first shot really shocked me, and I didn't know what was going on. He does it again, in the same area, before I realize that he wants to fight. I hadn't been paying attention to the fact that the only people who were around were middle-aged women who couldn't possibly fight this guy. I drop my stuff, and I give him one back. I start screaming for help

He keeps hitting me in the head as I throw out maximum 2 more shots. Unfortunately, a mini-garden? I trip on the surrounding fence, and fall onto the soil and plants below. I can't get up as this guy is just whacking away. He notices, and I notice, that my cries for help weren't in vain, and some more people started crowding around whilst the women who were there first had called 911. He fled the scene.

What was really shocking was that he never made a grab for anything that I had. He never told me to give him money

So the cops come in within 2 minutes, ask the onlookers and I for his characteristics, and they FOUND HIM. They found him within 8 minutes of us giving them the info, and I was ecstatic. They gave me ice for my now swollen head, told me to go to court to testify, and gave me a free trip home. The Chicago cops are actually a really nice bunch.

First off, I have most likely faced more hardship than many. So lately I’ve been considering writing some sort of book or autobiography and figured reddit would be a good way for me to figure out what people would like to know.

I never knew or met my father so it was always just me and my mom. I was homeless from the time I was 6 until I was about 17. We slept in parks with other homeless people, motels, and random drug dealer’s houses (at 7 years old I was an expert on methamphetamine). On many occasions I took care of myself while my mom was in jail because of her drug addiction. I can’t count the number of times I was awaken by SWAT teams, with guns drawn, breaking down the front door of wherever we were staying. We got most of our food from so-called “soup kitchens” and by stealing it from grocery stores. Despite all of this, I managed to make it all the way through school and graduated high school. I went to 7 different elementary schools in the same county because we moved around so much and our only transportation was bikes and public buses. To this day, I still financially support my mom.

I’m just under 30 years old and have spent 6 years in the Army with a tour to Iraq. I worked as an EMT in some of the dirtiest and poorest parts of Los Angeles and I am now a paramedic. I guess I consider myself to be successful considering the circumstances

I’m definitely not looking for pity or crying about my sad life. I’m simply sharing my story.

Note: I'm moving the IAmA over to the /r/CasualIAmA subreddit since a mod informed me that this kind of IAmA is not appropriate for /r/IAmA. Sorry for the inconvenience!

For a year now I've been wasting much of my day reading and posting on Reddit. Every so often I will get a question about my username and what it means. So in celebration of my cake day I've decided to do an AMA and give out some Reddit Gold. At the end of my cake day I will award a month of Reddit Gold to the first person who can PM me with the actual meaning behind my username. I have extra Reddit Gold too so I can give some to others who guess correctly as well. (Remember to PM me with your guess so no one else can just run with your answer.) If too many people guess correctly I will draw names at random. I will also give out Reddit Gold to any other posts in this thread that appeal to me. It might be funny, or it might be nothing but a big fat effort at bribery. Oh yeah, at the end of the day I will also post the meaning behind my username.

So with that out of the way. AMA!

Edit: As for verification

Edit 2: IAmAWhaleSexologist correctly deduced that it is from a hash (see his thread for more explanation if you don't know what a hash is). So now the only question is what word is being hashed. Figure that out and you're home free!

Edit 3: Here is an online hash calculator: http://www.fileformat.info/tool/hash.htm If you type in the word ""test"" you can see that it will generate an SHA-1 (the algorithm used for my username) of: a94a8fe5ccb19ba61c4c0873d391e987982fbbd3  http://www.fileformat.info/tool/hash.htm?text=test Part of the usefulness of a hash is scrambling the contents up so much that you can't tell what the original text was. In fact if you just change the input text from ""test"" to ""Test"" by capitalizing the first letter

Some random information to get things going

* Entry fee is about 30€. 
* You get french kissing
* One time i paid 30€ more to blow my load on a girls beautiful belly 
* Once paid 50€ more to cum in her mouth
* I recently had sex with two chicks at once. No lesbo show but i had a very very very good time
* The girls shower
* I usually go there every 2 weeks
* theres a bar, sauna, outdoor pool area, ..., tv's with sports events everywhere
* with the entry fee you also get free drinks (non-alcoholic) and rather shitty food
* There is a darker porn cinema room where you can watch porn

Ask me anything you want and how stuff works in there. In my opinion

Me and a very big percentage of men worldwide could never ever get the kind of women that are available in those clubs. I have a big thing for supermodel type figures and had sex a few times with a very tall and crazy slim girl with a 10/10 body and a 8/10 face. I could never ever get her in real life. First, i see her naked and if i want her, i can have a thing that feels like a super quick and spontaneous one night stand with her happening in the next 10 minutes. And if she wasn't a hooker, she would not be as good at giving lap dances, blowing or riding you like in a crazy porn movie. All this makes it a crazy service, but i know what's missing compared to real love and it's not like i don't want those things. But it's very good entertainment like eating out or getting a massage.

But after having sex with a lot of pretty girls and very beautiful bodies

Could elaborate on this further but i have to leave for 20 minutes. Ask me anything

It would not be feasible to relate the events of one’s life within a single post on a forum, when she passed away. I moved out into the big wide world when I was 17, having spent the entirety of my childhood in 76 Foster Homes, 8 Group Homes and 3 modern day Orphanages.

The variance of neglect, I remember supressing a bubble of excitement as she poured me a cup of hot cocoa with a pinch of chili powder. At this point in my life, I had already suffered beatings which resulted in several fractures and a handful of molestation incidents. I remember harboring a rather distinct distrust of adults. Yet, this elegant woman became more and more beautiful to me as I sipped my hot cocoa; until the final sip which was abhorrent and bitter. A symbolism which was lost on me at such a young age. Within my first week living with Fay our happy façade had disintegrated. I removed the batteries from the remote control in an effort to fix my broken doll. Upon Fay’s discovery of this minor theft, I was placed within the broom closet under lock and key for three months. I was given a flash light with the very same batteries I had pilfered, along with a child versioned Bible. I was allowed weekly respites from my confinement, in which I would aid Fay in disposing of and disinfecting my excrement which built up day to day. Once the batteries died

After three months of placement in a new Foster Home, I had extreme photofobia, pressure point sores, muscle atrophy, and ammonia skin burns from where I was forced to sit in my own excrement. I underwent several months of hospitalization, and as a result was promptly removed from Fay’s loving care.

Following my recovery, and molested me and the other foster children throughout the entirety of my year long stay. The abuse took many different forms, but one occurrence in particular always stood out to me during recollections. We would be sitting side by side in the family van after an excursion and he would require me to squeeze his penis after he would squeeze my thigh. Subsequently he would assail me with malignant comments; “You are disgusting”, “What a little whore”, “You are filthy”. This activity would reoccur as though a nightmare on a perpetual loop. It utterly destroyed my self-worth as a child. Thankfully, one of my teachers took note of my capricious demeanour. After an interrogation by my Social Worker a perfunctory removal from that home ensued.

The three of us were then placed with a wealthy and highly religious couple. We participated in church and Sunday school each week. The father figure was an enormous man, I would be forced to run the expansive property carrying weights, while I would be assaulted by a barrage of thrown stones. Late at night, on returning from community activities with the Church, I would be expelled from the car and made to run alongside as we made our way home. The upstairs bathroom was situated in close proximity to the winding staircase, and the father figure was adamant that I remained within my bedroom at night, for fear I would tumble down the stairs. Ironic, a little rebel at heart, these traps would intensify. The culmination was a large strip of cardboard with hundreds of thumb tacks pushed through, albeit a much larger closet

I was later removed from this home when my older sister was beaten after she tried to decorate my closet with toys

As a result of my childhood, or finding myself locked inside closets again.

[–]0wnage[S] 1 point 9 minutes ago
When I was in the states i hardly knew my dad, but believe it or not I enjoyed when he wasnt at home because when he came home he was always yelling constantly, he never was in a good mood. He always argued about everything. When we moved to Egypt he became 10 times worse. He was 10 times as strict, 10 times more angry for some reason, and he was more violent. I feared him so much, after i ran the fear slowly turned into hatred. I couldnt run from my own dad, besides, but as i stated before

What was your dad's reason for forcing you all to move...?


[–]0wnage[S] 1 point 17 minutes ago
Its pretty obvious. My dad wanted me to pick up Islamic culture and pick up Islam itself. I never realized what Islam really was until I moved to Egypt. I was in huge culture shock, my biggest fear is, believe it or not, Islam. I know Islam may not be as bad as i state it is, but for me, what they made me do was extreme. This is why to this date I am an athiest and i dont want to have anything to do with religion.

Night three (post divorce decision).  I moved some stuff out of the bedroom and took over the living room and couch.  Since I don't know anyone else up here (aside from work acquaintances)

My wife did as well, and via chatlogs I saw the nice reunion conversation they had.  

She talked about how hurt she was that he told her he ""doesn't want to talk to her ever again"" - that her ""heart hurt"" because of his comments and how much he really hurt her.  They agreed they could only be friends (what does that mean..?)

He asked how counseling was going,"" and that all she talks about ""is the emotional affair,"" - followed by a roll eye smiley face.  

Earlier tonight she was crying, but I said no.  

So that's tonight.  I feel incredibly lonely

I cried for about a minute earlier, and I get over most things very quickly.  I also don't think I've ever been truly mad or in a rage..usually just hurt or annoyed.

I was born in 1986 to a happily married couple. My father was an avid motocrosser and hunter. My mother, and passed away when I was 6 month old. My dad found another woman and ended up having 3 more kids. But we will get to that.

My stepmother from day 1 seemed to have hated me. She ignored me
~smacked with a frying pan upside the head if dishes weren't done
~Thrown down the stairs if dinner wasn't on the table
~Punched in the face if any of my siblings said I did something
~Locked in my room for up to 3 days at a time.

That's to name a few. I didn't have toys growing up. I had a single stuffed bunny (which I still have), no underwear and no socks. My dad was at work so often that he had no idea. Everyday it was the same. Even going to school I was picked on and abused. I was the freak and the different one. I had maybe 1 or 2 friends throughout school days. 

For years it was the same thing. Wake up, beat and yelling, rinse repeat. When I hit grade 6, I started cutting. I finally had enough and packed a bag. Left for the streets. It had to be better right?

I spent the next couple years drifting from shelters to houses to bridges and benches. Smoking anything put in front of me, I just wanted to die. I didn't care. I was smoking upwards of a quarter ounce of meth a day, PCP for breakfast, Mushrooms for lunch, coke and pills for dinner. I was told several times I wouldn't make it to 19. 

One day I was arrested and thrown in jail. I was given a pregnancy test at 15 years old

I ended up having my daughter on Aug 2nd 2002 at noon. I decided to keep her. Good news

After I had my daughter, and telling my siblings that she would need to bleach the bathtub case I was a dirty whore.

It's 3:02AM and I am returning from a trip to the local 24hr everything store with a copy of Starcraft 2 - League was down for patching, I had always wanted to play Starcraft 2.

The seasons first significant snowfall still coated the countryside from the night previous

I knew something was up as I had left my driveway for the store. At the top of my switchbacked driveway lay before me a meandering route through mountainous nether to civilization. And there, as moose often do, and then veered off and wheedled with her offspring up the side of a fucking mountain like no big deal.

On my way back up that very same mountain, the cute little humpbacked baby moose, came bursting out of the bush in front of my vehicle! I slowed to a crawl but that little douchedrinker daisy-stepped directly along my route of travel to the foot of my driveway.

My switchbacked driveway.

My steep

I didn't know where the momma moose was

The baby breaks back in to the bush on the other side of the road, galloping, bum rushing, motherbitch of a moose heading straight for me!

I gunned my car

*But it wasn't over*.

Momma moose followed me. Cautiously, I had gotten in between her and her baby.

I thought I was safe, and inhaled the deepest breath of the coldest air I had filled my lungs with in a long while.

Then I saw her. She looked at me, and it was not a foot on the other side of me.

Needless to say, hardcore parkour'd some stacked logs, and did a barrel roll. I lived, but barely. I looked back at where the moosecow had started her charge, and that whore was standing in almost exactly the same place - as if taunting me, trying to make me think that she had never charged in the first place.

For centuries we've been hunting pilot whales as a source of nutrition

In recent years a lot of large organizations (maybe especially Green Peace) have targeted us for these hunts, we don't really need to hunt anymore. Because of this controversy, most people are taking extreme sides. On one side there's the folks (generally non-Faroese) who are 100% against whaling, and on the other side (and this side constitutes a large portion of my whole country) are the people who are 100% for whaling. 

Basically I'm kind of stuck in the middle. I don't participate in the hunts anymore and I rarely eat the meat. So. AMA! 

**TL;DR: Live in a country where people hunt whales as part of our culture. Most people are very extreme when it comes to their opinions

In a nutshell, hence the name, so even though I have the genes of a boy, I developed physically as a female... well, mostly anyway. I developed testes where my ovaries should've been, and I have no uterus, only a vagina. 

If you have *Complete* AIS, meaning you have a complete vagina and look completely female. You're also incapable of growing body hair, which I think is kind of cool. But unfortunately, I was born with a slight case of Partial AIS, which is a little different. Here's a [diagram](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Quigley_scale_for_androgen_insensitivity_syndrome.jpg) (WARNING: NSFW obviously) showing the differences in genitalia in Complete AIS and Partial AIS- 6/7 being a completely normal set of junk for a normal female, which someone with Complete AIS will have. I was born with a 5, so my clits a tiny bit bigger and my vag is a little smaller than normal. It's kind of a bitch. 

Anyways, and taller than both of my parents). I can't get my period (no uterus, duh), and unlike people with Complete AIS, I still grow body hair like a normal person.

If you have not been in a while

**Background**

I had bad childhood experiences, or x-rays, or anything. The thought of visiting the d fills me with so much anxiety, I can't even sit still. I was not afraid of the d, like I am afraid of a wasp; I hated the d, I hated the thought, I hated everything to do with teeth, I hated them. And so I did not go

My smile looked fine

**Meeting the D**

I did some research and found a d that specialized in anxious patients and sedation.  I called them up and made an appointment. My hands shook on the phone. ""When was your last visit?"" they asked. I cringed as I told them. But they had heard it before.

My first appointment with Dr. D was only to take x-rays, my nails dug into my skin. I hated people looking at my teeth, and I was terrified of what they might find. He looked at each tooth and said some acronym; I didn't understand what they meant but I figured they were bad, some description of awful decay. I felt sick to my stomach.

Dr. D asked me to tell him about my bad experiences. He said, that a combative relationship with your d is inevitable.

I began to believe that it did not have to be that way. Dr. D could be my ally, never to embarrass me. He was not an authority figure I must answer to, but a service provider I could utilize, like the pizza guy. I learned that 80% of his patients have bad anxiety, that my teeth were not the worst he's ever seen. That there were others like me.

**Sedation and Existentialism**

Dr. D told me about the sedation options: standard nitrous, but it would be quite expensive (~$7k an hour) and risky.

I had researched Halcion. It is a hypnotic: you are technically awake but in a ""twilight state, with no memory of the procedure. The Halcion sedation would cost something like $400. $400 to not have to lie in the chair for hours, the bright lights in my face, the creepy masks leering over me, the metal probes. I wanted it.

As an aside, with the promise that you would not remember it, would you accept it? Isn't that just like subjecting another person to the pain? But my teeth hurt. Halcion for me.

**The Experience**

It wasn't really a pill: it was half a tablespoon of vaguely vanilla tasting powder, a little like being drunk. But I still felt anxious. I wanted to get up and walk around. I could, right? But Dr. D told me not to, to try to relax. Was I relaxing enough? They put headphones on me with music, and I lay there and listened to it. It wasn't enough. I needed more triazolam, I was sure of it; I'm still fully awake. Guys? Would I remember this? Was my memory now detached?

Then there were dark shapes, I was in a forest, or maybe the beach, flowers. Heard voices: open, close, turn. It was easy to do so. I felt a plastic tube on my nose. Nitrous. Were they just starting? How long had I been here? Would I remember this?

And then I saw light. Rest, confused and unsure, but unconcerned. Was it over? It had only been maybe half an hour, right? My wife was here. I was wheeled out to our car in a wheelchair. My teeth didn't hurt. I could stand. I got into the car.

I was groggy for the rest of the day; next day I was at 100%. My teeth didn't hurt.

**Conclusions**

My teeth were in pretty bad shape, a root canal, a crown, and a few onlays (half-crowns). I don't feel like any of that happened, and I would not believe them except that my teeth don't hurt any more, and I have the temporary crown. I'm going back in a month for a few more fillings and the permanent crown, and then next year for my wisdom teeth.

I went from horrible, and the first visit where they looked at my teeth. I experienced zero pain during or after. While I did not ""lie down and wake up at home,"" I have only vague memories, like remembering a pleasant dream. I was there for five hours, but it felt like two.

What about my existential questions? Was there some version of me who underwent terrible pain, facing his nightmares full on? No, and I know because I left myself notes on my phone:

    Hi somnodentata Doing ok don't worry
    All done No worries
    Will I forget this car ride

Creepy but reassuring messages from beyond. And my teeth don't hurt.

If you are like me, PM me and I'll tell you mine.

**Why Write Now:**

The two mass murders in elementary schools on Friday have sparked a lot of discussions about mental health, if this story can help anybody understand what they personally experience before bad stuff happens, or the social stigma against mental health in America diminishes, that will be worth it.

**Symptoms/Experiences:**

The first abnormal thing I remember was vividly hallucinating that small (but very heavy) motorcycles were driving across my face. The pain was unbearable. I was somewhere between five and seven, but it felt like an eternity.

For as long as I can remember all sorts of little things were irrationally terrifying: places where ""darkness came from"" like drains or under the bed. Even in high school I could imagine to the point of ""feeling"" arms of darkness coming out from these places and trying to grab at my ankles.

I remember thinking that other kids didn't have very good imaginations. I remember around 11-13 if I willed something hard enough

I lived in fiction books. Funny things were always happening to Harry Potter, but sometimes I'd sit in my room for hours and try to puzzle it together. It was somewhat dark and compulsive behavior.

Around 15 my parents had me on a lot of drugs (long story). They were concerned I was sick (long story) and I was taking a huge number of heart drugs, and I was regularly threatened with being put in a mental institution if I talked back or behaved poorly, so I was terrified to tell them I was hallucinating.

At 18 I was disowned. As I never had been diagnosed with anything and saw no reason to take the medicines.  I told myself I was hallucinating due to the drugs

The hallucinations didn't stop. Especially under stress I would hear voices that I knew were not there, they overlapped in weird ways where two pieces of data tried to lie in the same place. I became very good at body language so I gather more data and figure out which bits of my perceptions were incorrect so I could cut them out.

**Social:**

This became my darkest secret. I was terrified above anything else of somebody learning I was crazy

I finished college and worked at two reputable entities. I thought I had learned to live with it. I cultivated a reputation as an alert and childish personality so that if I turned around to look at something as if startled

I told my first friend when I was 21

There were still close calls. The closest one was when eating lunch with coworkers and I heard a horrible crash, so I guess my expression was a little out of hand and I remembered breathlessly asking him if he was OK. He just stared at me. I felt like the room stopped, and everybody was staring at me. I couldn't figure out any excuse for my behavior fast enough.

**Getting Help:**

I'm not sure how much was blind fear from there and how much was a bunch of really smart coworkers beginning to add things up, and off I went.

I'll never forget the first doctor's appointment. I hadn't been to a doctor since I was 18 (I hated them) but I'd been to Urgent Care a few times

""So what are you here for today? Annual physical? STD tests?"" ""I haven't had my ADD meds in years and I'd like them please, and I hear voices that aren't there.""

The doctor took it remarkably well. She looked up my X-Rays from two years ago when they had originally found I had a sewing needle in my foot

My psychiatrist ran a lot of tests and eventually decided it was depression. I didn't want to believe him

I remember the first time I woke up and the meds were working. It wasn't my birthday and it wasn't Christmas, but I'll never forget that feeling as long as I live. The data which didn't fit in fell away, no more voices, no more weird things which didn't add up. Dark things don't ""weigh"" on me, sometimes I enjoy walking around in dark rooms just because I know it doesn't bother me now.

Finding the right medicine was rough and I was forced to go without a few times in the process

**Obligatory ""if you suspect you're crazy"" stuff I wish somebody had said to me:**

* DO NOT SELF MEDICATE. Self-medicating for say an arm is OK because you use your brain to think about your arm and consider effects. Here you're trying to use your brain to think about your brain
* Make a save file. If you do go off the deep end
* You can always opt to stop taking your medicine if you really hate it. In the US, in my philosophy, as an adult there is little to no harm in seeing what help is out there, and there is so much to potentially gain.

**tl;dr: I was crazy and heard voices. Turned out it was depression and super controllable. If you think you're crazy go to the doctor and get help,False,,t5_2sxwp,1355736868.0,,,t3_14zc3n

Let's get one thing right. Saudis aren't oil tycoons. No one is. I guess except for Saudi ARAMCO CEO. As it's the only company allowed to dig for oil in Saudi Arabia. But they can do contracts with other companies for simple stuff like transport or constructions ... Etc. And ARAMCO is owned by the Royal Family of Saud. Which means all the oil is owned by the government. However

Saudi Arabia is a fond of America
The two governments have much interests. Iran is our common enemy

About politics in Saudi Arabia... Well a good ol' libertarian would say, which is in a translated slang called 'behind the sun'...

The government tends to struggle to force their rule over the people whether you like it or not. If not, or other Social Networks. Hopefully reddit is left unmonitored.

Islamic police is one of the most infamous government agency that can be noticed about Saudi Arabia

There are many types of people in Saudi Arabia. The good, they stick to old rules and ignore the social advancement and disrespect anyone with other opinions. These people can get away with dissing the government because they are the HOLLY MEN OF ISLAM, as if this changes anything. There are liberal people who like the idea where people can do whatever they are pleased to do and they are the rich, the famous figures or even people of media in Saudi Arabia, some of which are silent activists. 

Speaking of the rich, Amsterdam and Miami. Yes I might consider one of them as I do enjoy that kind of luxury except that I don't like the dictatorship of my government. But I will TRY to keep my post unbiased. 

Furthermore, mostly of porn and political sites and posts on popular sites. We get all the video games we want and we still can go to cafés and restaurants. Yes we have Starbucks and TGI Fridays, as I said, not different. 

Popular to misbelieve women here can actually travel where  they want in Saudi Arabia. Except abroad. But that applies to most men

In the end I would like to conclude that the worst part of Saudi Arabia is its dictatorship and censorship. But people still can get by.

I can answer whatever you want me to about being a sociopath
Not all sociopaths are the same, ability to lie extremely convincingly, and etc.
I view life and the world as existing to entertain me. I am capable of emotions such as love, but it is more of a direct conscious emulation of those emotions rather than something that occurs naturally. What I feel is real, but it is only real because I make it real.
I care only about a very, my father recently left my mother and 4 younger brothers, and when I told him how disappointing he was he hinted that he was going to commit suicide, but that is something that I do not care about.
I was friends with another sociopath at one point, torturing, and eating women. We were too different for me to care whether he was a part of my life or not so I cut him from it.
I'm just giving a little information that I could expand upon if asked. I do not know how to submit proof for this
With everything said and done

Questions/Answers from r/IAmA:


**Can you spot another sociopath after interacting with them for a few hours or days?**

Yes

**Can you elaborate on their words and questions?**

I couldn't quite explain it. They just talk differently. A lot is also in the physical queues, what they do with their hands, etc.
Edit: Social ineptitude is also a big giveawa

**How many parts of the triangle do you fall into? Do you think that you would genuinely mourn if a close relative died?**

If by triangle you mean bed wetting/animal cruelty/starting fires, it would honestly depend who it is. While I don't dislike my family, the only deaths what would affect me would be the ones of my mother, my grandfather, or my youngest brother.

**Does accepting and acknowledging that you're a sociopath make a difference at all?**

Make a difference in what

**I guess can you control the feelings or behavior at all?**

There isn't much that is different

**Have you read the book: The Sociopath Next Door? If so

I have not

**At what age did you realize you were a sociopath? Are all of your emotions emulated? For example

I would say that roughly 90% of my emotions are emulated. When no one else is around, they are real (again) because I make them real. I don't tend to find jokes funny, what I find funny are situations that involve the confusion and manipulation of ""normal"" people. I have genuinely laughed at that.
Edit: I realized I was a sociopath at about the age of 14

**Are there any manipulations you refrain from doing
Similar to the last question. Do you care about what people think of you in any way shape or form? Would you refrain from doing something to make people not trust you or think of you in a certain way that might have negative side effects in the future. IE

Obviously violent/threatening manipulation is something that I stay away from. And I do prefer people to like me
I do not really care what people think of me, but only when there are actual situations that could evoke the pity in the manipulated party. For example, my house was destroyed in consecutive floods 5 years apart, and I was able to milk that extremely well in school and with relatives. I tend to wish that bad things would happen to me so that I can use them to my advantage.

**What is your ultimate goal? Just getting people to do what you are expecting them to
Have you ever pushed the limits just for fun? Or do you enjoy keeping things planned out for longevity.**

My ultimate goal is entertainment. I don't view society as capable of advancement
I have, I just know what subtle things can set a person off and I am very good at it. For the most part I keep things in an equilibrium though.

**Any good behavioral manipulation techniques that you are willing to share?
Have you ever taken MDMA? If so
What human organizational behavior do you find it most irritating to have to emulate?
Does it drive you nuts that all the normal people and our society at large keep making all the same bad decisions for the same emotional reasons over and over again and never learn or even have the capability to understand why they are screwing up?**

Any good behavioral manipulation techniques that you are willing to share?

Please elaborate on this

Have you ever taken MDMA? If so

I have not, and do not ""get high"". All that happened after my first 40mg of oxy was a headache. I took it often just socially with a couple friends and pretended I was tripping out, but there really was nothing. Addiction to anything has never been an issue to me. I am also incapable of getting drunk.

What human organizational behavior do you find it most irritating to have to emulate?

Pointless interaction, etc. Much more can be accomplished by getting to the point.

Does it drive you nuts that all the normal people and our society at large keep making all the same bad decisions for the same emotional reasons over and over again and never learn or even have the capability to understand why they are screwing up?

It does not matter to me

**Anything in particular you just dont enjoy doing? Manipulating love interests for example?
Do you have any funny/horrific stories of how you completely destroyed someones day or even life?**

I have had only love interest
I had a ""friend"" who had an older brother who died of cancer when he was about 6, but we had a habit of making lewd and awful, extremely inappropriate jokes. We were talking (the next year) and I decided to go on and on about his brother, getting to a point where I told him that I'd like to go into his parent's room at night, tie them down, masturbate on their faces, and dump his brother's ashes on them so it sticks like glitter.

1338471378.0,udtwv,I lived on the internet as a woman for 8 years. AMA,dragqueen_throwaway,48,12,46,"When I was 10 years old, medically and mentally speaking.  

I eventually became curious and started talking to some guys. They told me they didn't want to talk to other guys, I sounded pretty much like a female through a laptop microphone. They would get on webcam and ... yeah.  

As time went on, I would be a woman in real life as well. By this time, I was going on webcam in full makeup with long hair and looked a lot like a woman. I had trained myself to sound like one as well. I don't think it was the sexual part I enjoyed, more so talking to them and making them feel better about themselves. The guys I really enjoyed talking to were the ones who looked like they were nervous, just wanted someone to talk to, etc.  

I stopped when I was 18 wearing the makeup and being like that in person. Not to divulge too many personal details, etc. for doing so, but I have no regrets. I still go online and do voice-only with guys sometimes. My friend actually took pics for me to use because she was fascinated when I told her. I'm now 24, in college, and perfectly happy. Feel free to ask me anything.

1330890401.0,qhh5h,I am a 30 year old autistic person. AMA.,chimpanzee,36,7,72,"- I live alone and work from home as a programmer

- I'm very introverted (not all autistics are!), and I've never actually had trouble with making friends, mostly because my drive in that area is so low that I can get away with being very picky about who I try to make friends with and only make the attempt when there's a good chance it will go well.

- I do have sensory integration issues (including some pretty significant auditory-processing trouble and an intermittent balance issue), very synesthetic, so even when everything's running 'as normal' I'm still not functioning in quite the same way everyone else is.

- I have trouble reading body language. Oddly enough

- I don't have any perseverations/special interests at the moment, rather than having the topic take over my life on a near-permanent basis.

- I have Opinions on the state of modern psychiatric care. You may or may not want to ask me about that. Insufficiently specific questions will probably just get a rant in response. :P",,t5_2sxwp,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/qhh5h/i_am_a_30_year_old_autistic_person_ama/

Two years into custody we found a lady who wanted to take three of the youngest girls. A year later my littlest brother was becoming somewhat difficult so she took him too.
