Lots of verified
www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=2948672

Also in the description section of this YouTube video:
www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH0Ktk_Y88M

The new details:

- The album releases on the 22nd of January via Sargent House
- Track list is as follows
 1. Cat Fantastic 
 2. Havoc in the Forum 
 3. Left Aligned (Formerly called ""Mind Your Head"" I think)
 4. In the Branches of Yggdrasil 
 5. I'll Take the Minute Snake 
 6. 2 Birds
 7. Nice Riff
 8. Triptych 
 9. Pygmy Polygamy 
 10. A Different Kind of Tall (small) 
 11. +3 Awesomeness Repels Water 
 12. 13.0.0.0.1
- The album is titled ""13.0.0.0.0"" as a reference to the Mayan 2012 end of the world prediction.
- This album cover is an image of the round

Some older details:

- Stuart Smith, formerly of another band called Pennines.
- Their bassist Jamie Cooper also left the band in 2011 to focus on a career in graphic design.
- TTNG is now a trio, and Henry Tremain on vocals and bass/guitar duties.

An interview with The Math Rock Blog about the new album:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=HGb2yZNbjSY

Also, you'll probably need what's called a Spider Capo. Essentially, a spider capo is a capo that can be adjusted to hold down individual strings. I know for sure that Cat Fantastic uses one. They're around $30 on eBay. Spider capos are also great for playing the songs Baboon and Lemur instead of using a banjo capo.

Some videos:

Havoc in the Forum:

Left Aligned (Formerly called Mind Your Head):

I was asking a totally rhetorical

Given that we have a definition of math rock (it's in the sidebar) and a host of bands that are given the math rock moniker at the time of the genres conception (re: wikipedia ""In the 1990s, with influential groups also coming from Japan and Southern California."") I think we can make a mental frankenstein of all of these known math rock groups and compare the individual bands to that frankenstein.

As an aside

Here, guitar-driven version of minimalist composition a la Steve Reich/Phillip Glass with elements of serialists like Bartok and Schoenberg but I'm open to amending this definition given the amount of subgenres math rock has spawned (twinkledaddies, mathcore, mathpop, etc.). With that in mind, might it be more helpful to do the frankenstein treatment? I don't know, so let's figure it out.

So let's be amateur music historians and hash this out because I'm pretty interested both in the outcome and, academic argument without it turning into a dick-measuring contest over who 'gets music' more.
