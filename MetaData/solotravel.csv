1367911135.0,1dum14,5 Unforgettable Ridiculous Days in Saigon,LivePurple,93,25,35,"Just had to share.

**Day 1** I arrive in Saigon. I sweat my ass off in a real weight room for the first time in months. I meet a Hippie Ex-Pat who hooks me up with a joint. I drink with 4 Vietnamese girls and take one of them back to a hotel for some small talk / rough sex.

**Day 2** SLEEEEEEEP. Meet up with the same girl and one of her friends. We ride motorcycles all over the city and hit up an incredible seafood joint, a club, and delicious street food. I take her to the same hotel again. She pays for the room. I convince her to try anal. Nice.

**Day 3** She takes me to a water park. We splash around and scream on water-slides all day. We get back and I tie her up using the Japanese bondage rope I'd purchased the week before in the 8 story tall sex shop in Tokyo. She likes it. She leaves to go to work. I start feeling ill.

**Day 4** I wake up with a fever. Fuck. I am sweating and shivering in a somewhat delirious state for 6 hours. I eat nothing, and it's not going to wait. God damnit. I drop trow and try to squeeze one out before I puke all over the bathroom. My ass proceeds to unleash hellish diarrhea into the bowl as I try to keep my stomach in check. It is the definition of explosive. Suddenly the world goes into slow motion. I see stars. I'm sweating profusely and realize that something is profoundly wrong. I'm about to pass out. I decide I need help, but I'm deadlocked in this room. Summoning the last of my strength, I whip my pants up, stumble to the hotel door, unlatch it and fall to the ground in the hallway. I lose consciousness. Yes. I shit so hard I passed out.

I come to after who knows how long and am too weak to stand. I contemplate whether I need to go to the hospital. I decide to give sleeping it off one more shot. I crawl back into bed

**Day 5** I wake up at 6am to find I have shit the bed.

1349207061.0,10tzrb,Why travel solo?,norkkinimod,61,4,39,"As it seems to me

First of

Reasons for going solo:

- **No partner? No problem!** Travel partners should be chosen wisely. I've had friendships ruined within a 10 day trip. If you don't know your partner well enough before travelling, you know each others weak points and tolerate them. If you can't think of someone like that for your journey, it might be best to go alone.

- **The wolf pack** Especially if you travel together with a group it's very likely to happen

- **Travel light** What goes for your backpack might also apply to your company. You and yourself can go wherever you feel like in any moment

- **Dora the Self-explorer** While travelling with others you can discuss every new experience, you need to be with yourself. You can just enjoy every impression, really let yourself go, if you are not feeling watched, or even judged by someone else. In some cases you might find new ways of thinking inside yourself or a new way of living by the culture you've just stumbled into. Anyhow travelling alone will definitely change you... hopefully for the better. (new aspect from xTooTiredToCarex) 

(more reasons likely to follow)

Risks of going solo:

- **Lonely hearts club** One of the biggest challenges for any solotraveller is loneliness. You don't speak the language but want to have a deep conversation or you just need someone to comfort you while beeing homesick, you might feel even more lonely. Beeing stuck alone in the rainforest during a Taifun for three days is nothing compared to beeing in a crowded bar in an inhospitable area, where everyone is avoiding the stranger. That's the point where you should entertain yourself by building shelter, or buy a big bottle of vodka and share it with random people next to you - depending on the situation of course.

- **Gimme your money!** Travelling as a group might be safer in most parts of the world, but I try to keep this universally valid). Alone you are easily outnumbered. For most of us it's less likely to get out of such a situation Jackie Chan-style than just getting stabbed. Most important is: Don't look like an easy target. If you're not built like a bear, just avoid carrying around expensive stuff openly, dressing fancy in a non-fancy area or looking like you are lost and frightened (even if you are). Common sense is the best way to notice if someone is just friendly or wants to lure you to something unpleasant. Even if you stumble into a shady situation, always act self-confident. Just like with other mamals, don't show fear in front of humans. Don't be too proud to yell for help, as soon as shit is really going to hit the fan.

- **Can you hand me th... Oh.** Everybody needs an extra hand from time to time. Setting up camp, stuff like this feels safer and is faster done, if you have someone with you. But it's far from impossible. All you need to do is to practice particular skills and if you're alone... well you don't have any other option than to do it by yourself, right?

- **The Aftermath** Every journey leaves you with a huge ammount of experiences, experienced the same things with you. Someone who really understands what you're actually talking about. After a long solo trip it may seem like no one really can empathise while you tell the most fantastic stories to them. Their eyes just look empty while you feel like you've had a glimpse of heaven. And still they want you to talk about it. This can lead to feeling less at home, every time you return home and is a big part of the so called ""Traveller's Curse"". It seems there is no certain cure for this. For me personally it helps a lot to write about my trips instead of telling stories to my friends in person.

1372171775.0,1h1fya,My Guide to Solotraveling and Why You'll Love It,croptonyellow,70,12,27,"Hello

I found that I ended up putting lots of little tidbits in various comment threads and that it might make more sense to just do one big comprehensive guide to solotraveling.

A bit about me, Tokyo, Sydney and Auckland.  Major disclaimer, these are based on my experiences alone and should not be taken as gospel or a singularly comprehensive guide to anything, just my advice after making some dumb mistakes and learning a lot.


1) How do you like to travel?

Before picking a destination or methods of transportation, you'll have the best time if you know your likes and dislikes.  If you enjoy a warm, comfy bed and a bathroom with granite countertops, backpacking through Vietnam may not be your thing.  If you can't stand being trapped on a plane, probably best to save Australia for another day (assuming you're in Europe or the Americas, that is).  The point is, some soul searching beforehand can save you a lot of grief.  Just be honest with yourself.  It's not a bad thing to enjoy staying at the Hilton


2) Picking a destination(s)

Particularly if this is your first trip, pick a place where they speak your native language, where you know the currency and/or the attractions, perhaps even a place you've been before.  

Bearing this in mind

Beyond genuinely being into where you want to go

-Financial issues: Can I afford transportation, food and drink, attraction prices, and extra cushion spending money?  Take what you spend now on a day-to-day basis and double it, and that's what you should be able to afford on your trip.  Traveling can get expensive very quickly on things you may not have predicted and it definitely helps to have a cushion.

-Visa issues: Probably not an issue for many people, always, ALWAYS check with your country's foreign office to see what restrictions or paperwork is needed.  Example: Australia and the USA - in the visa waiver program, but you're still required to fill out paperwork in advance.

-Language barriers: What's the native language?  Any de facto common languages?  For example, often times a bit more.  Movies, TV, music and films
more often than not are produced in English so people globally have been exposed to it.  That said, it shows that you tried and give a crap and people are more willing to respond, as opposed to being ""that guy"" who yells in English and assumes people will speak it.

-Comfort issues: Is the place a 14 hour plane ride away, etc etc.  Basically see #1.


3) Planning your trip

You picked your destination?  Sweet!  Now plan your trip.  To maximize your experience I would recommend planning out and booking in advance (if possible) the following:

-Flights or other to-destination transportation

-Hotels/accommodation

-Transportation to/from the airport, VERY expensive, like London or Tokyo).  Most cities typically have a train or a bus that goes to the city center which is almost always cheaper and pretty easy.

-Get some cash before you leave: I usually do about $50-$100 in local currency.  Helps grease the wheels

-A couple of things to do: Always good to have some sights in mind in your backpocket, but it always helps.

The first of these are absolutes - flights, exhausted, slightly delirious and overstimulated.  What, you want to now find a hotel so you're not homeless for the night?  It just makes life so much easier.  Some people enjoy the ""adventure"" of finding a place when you land, personally that sounds like a recipe for disaster.  

I personally use Expedia to book hotels and flights out of habit and because they have a frequent points program so if you use them enough you get small amounts of coupons (very small, though Expedia also has comments and ratings.  I'd check out other sites as well, though, like Kayak, if you're particularly price conscious.  More on saving money on flights later.


4) You've arrived.  Now what?

Congrats, but rather seeing all the bigticket items and getting a solid first-time exposure to a new place, with the expectation that if I like it, I'd go back for a longer period of time and really do it ""right"".  For example, Reykjavik was 2 days, Cape Town 4, Tokyo 5, Auckland 3.  

The best piece of advice I can give on an actual trip is a quote I heard somewhere (not sure who said it, plans are useless.""  Have some destinations in mind, but at the same time, nothing beats an impromptu change of heart.  Because, after all, you're traveling alone, you can do whatever you want.

Appendix: Do's and Don't

This is just a general list of things I try to do or avoid when traveling.  Some I've learned from making dumb mistakes

A) Getting the cheapest flight.  Airlines operate a form of price discrimination where different people pay vastly different prices for the same basic seat.  Why?  Because they can.  But, and since the firm is paying for the flight, they don't care as much about price.  Thus, avoid when business people travel, which is often Sunday or Monday, Thursday or Friday (sometimes Thursday, anyway).  Saturdays and Wednesdays are my go-to days.  The best thing you can do, is play around with booking sites.  If you have a general sense of when you'd like to go

B) Internet.  I always try to go for places with complimentary internet.  If you have to pay for it it's usually ridiculous expensive.  'Nuff said.

C) Make a list of 5-10 items that are absolutely irreplaceable.  It's really hard to try to remember every little thing that you packed and are supposed to remember.  Thus, wallet, phone, retainer, computer, phone charger, computer charger, I know I've got all the main items that I would need

D) Safes for passports: I usually do it just in case, a padlock for your bag is probably a good idea (and I wouldn't bring my laptop in this case either).

E) Walking and Stamina.  I tend to walk a lot, it's 20km away).  The reason is that when you walk everywhere a) you get great exercise, b) you get much more of a feel for the culture of the city you're in and c) you get the chance to see stuff you might normally have missed, stores, arcades, experiences, brewery tours (in my case).  I've found when I take the subway everywhere I end up seeing more planned destinations but at the expense of getting a real feel for the city I'm in.  

F) Look like you know where you're going/don't look like a tourist.  Walking with confidence is really helpful for looking like you know where you're going and thus aren't a tourist.  Made a wrong turn?  Go to the next block and go back.  A bit lost?  Go into a shop or store to look at your map.  Wearing your American flag t-shirt with shorts and flip-flops and a camera around your neck?  Go f*** yourself

G) Cash and ATMs.  I like to take $50-$100 in cash that I got in advance from an AmEx travel office.  The problem with Bureaus de Change and Travelexes and other similar services at the airport is they tend to charge a fat fee plus the terrible conversion rate.  If you have an American Express credit card they'll waive the fee, be aware of the following:
-Visa and MasterCard are the most accepted.  AmEx as well but it depends on the country.  Discover
-In the US and sometimes Canada credit cards are based on the magstripe on the back.  In Europe and elsewhere, many automated machines for tickets and others in a chip-and-pin country don't always take a magstripe card because a signature is required.  Best to stick with buying things from a person at the ticket window or wherever.
-ATMs: Know the fee structure upfront.  Usually with FX transactions you get the spot rate at the time + a 3% surcharge for credit cards and ATM withdrawals.  With withdrawing, if it's a big fixed fee, take out lots of cash upfront and keep the excess in the safe in the hotel).  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_ATM_Alliance 
-Traveler's checks: Good for fraud protection
-BIG NOTE ON DEBIT CARDS: Consider leaving it at home, once the EFTPOS goes through (electronic funds transfer point of sale, for the nerds like me), the cash is gone.  Some debit cards offer fraud protection/theft protection but it's less common.  Credit cards, however, have much higher fraud protection and in many cases your liability is limited to a fixed amount (I believe it's $50 but don't quote me on that).  Best to a) check with your card issuer what the limits are and b) if possible, avoid the problem by leaving your debit card at home and withdrawing cash in advance or traveler's checks.  You can theoretically withdraw cash from your credit card but by doing so you'll rack up a huge interest fee so best to avoid that.
Best thing to do is to write down your card numbers in advance so you can call the companies ASAP and report them stolen.


Why You're Nervous

It makes total sense to be nervous.  You're going to a foreign place, you don't (necessarily) speak the language, you don't know where you're going.  If you weren't nervous, particularly before your first trip, that would be a red flag, rather than the other way around.
However, you'll have a wonderful experience.  The best way to enjoy yourself is to mentally prepare yourself to have fun.  If you come into it with a negative attitude, you're gonna have a bad time (insert meme here).  The trick I use to psyche myself up before a trip is to focus on how much I'm going to grow and learn from the experience.  I'm going to get a crash course in an entirely new culture and style of living.  I'm going to experience something that most people dream of.  I'm going to have plenty of time to rest, relax, recharge, and reflect.  

And, I'm the master of my fate!"".  

Edit: A couple things on travel loneliness.  Traveling alone can get lonely

-If you have internet

-Bring books

-Chit chat and small talk.  It's just that, you learn from them that way.

-Focus on the present.  You'll see your friends and family again in a few days, you're only in [place] ""once"".

Edit 2: Formatting

TL;DR: You'll have fun

I've done quite a bit of solo traveling over the years and I noticed that it had put me into a certain mindset. A mindset which I decided to drop for the last trip I took. 

When I was 18 I traveled through India for about 3, it made me avoid engaging with most of the locals all together simply because I had some bad experiences in the past.

- When attending a [funeral ceremony on Bali](http://thebigdream.org/2012/07/the-death-of-a-guru-budakeling-bali-indonesia/) a man told me to come sit with him while we waited for things to start. We ended up spending the entire afternoon together discussing religion

- When arriving in [Makassar](http://thebigdream.org/2012/07/hey-mister-you-really-need-learn-bahasa-makassar-sulawesi-indonesia/) I wanted to go to a town called Bira. The directions I found online turned out to be pretty useless and no one at the bus terminal spoke English. I decided to sit down and read for a while and let the universe sort things out. I ended up arriving where I wanted to be because a group of local teens took me to their family home

- While attending a [funeral ceremony in Toraja](http://thebigdream.org/2012/08/a-torajan-funeral-tana-toraja-sulawesi-indonesia/) I spoke for a while with a young man who turned out to be the grandson of the deceased. He offered me to come up to the family house and join him in some spots normally inaccessible to tourists during the ceremony and we had a nice long talk about how it is to live with such traditional beliefs. We're now friends on facebook and chat regularly.

- Instead of just looking at the wares of the local [handicraft people](http://thebigdream.org/2012/07/kacek-and-his-coconuts-ubud-area-bali-indonesia/) and [artists](http://thebigdream.org/2012/07/asu-art-attack-ubud-bali-indonesia/), who taught them to do it, did they enjoy it?

I've spent the last week on a road trip of the Eastern US. Just me and my car. In that time, and tried to escape from reality.

I'm an introvert, and now I am doubting myself. I was not willing to take the risks on my own that I would with somebody else. I never felt bonded to a particular city. I would see a sight and have nobody to share the moment with. I was staying in generic hotels (Sleep Inns, Holiday Inns) filled with families and little opportunity of meeting anybody.

In my opinion those people are born with this feeling but for everyone there is one single event or experience that makes you finally close the door behind you and follow an uncertain path. 

I'm just the same. I always led an unsteady life, but still - kind of desperately - trying to settle down somewhere. And then I bought his book. I don't know why, I was in a tiny bookstore in Schwerin, North Germany, randomly took out a book with an interesting title and bought it. It was ""Between the Woods and the Water"" by Patrick Leigh Fermor. Afterwards I sat down in a Restaurant on the street next to the bookstore and began reading until it got too dark and cold to remain. Halfway through the book it just hit me... and for some reason I remember the very moment and location where I realised, that I might as well give in to my inner urge and continue moving until one day my legs won't move anymore. I remember, like it was yesterday, staring at the cabinet and then suddenly shutting the book and calling for my flatmates to tell them that I've decided to move out end of this month.

From there I treasured the books of Sir Fermor like they were one big bible. A whole pantheon of traveling authors emerged in my head, Fermor to Bruce Chatwin, Tiziano Terzani, Ceest Nooteboom and Michael Obert (to name a few). I ""inhaled"" their writings, their lives, their philosophies and my own life got easier. With accepting my own restlessness, I finally felt at ease with myself. I found myself among other haunted souls and learned that it's better to discover freely rather than to search for something. 

Now

One day I might eventually find myself at one place that drives this haunting away and I will settle down. But until then, I take out ""Between the Woods and the Water"", read it, pack my bag and get moving.

Now... what's your story?

Of course

1) Use your travels as an opportunity to learn as much as possible.  This can be obvious stuff like going to museums, observe local culture.  Watch local TV.  Read local newspapers and magazines (if possible, given language constraints).

2) Nonverbal communication is a great skill to learn.  Most communication

3) Always bring books.

4) Research where you're going in advance.  You get so much more out of your experience having a baseline knowledge of the country you're visiting.  As well

5) If you get homesick write a letter to a loved one or friend.  Simply the act of conveying your thoughts to someone you have a connection with will make you feel connected and less lonely.  

6) Try to make it a point to strike up a conversation (if possible given language constraints) with a local at least once a day.  It's a good way to force yourself to be sociable even if you're shy (like me).  Bartenders, though even people on the street.  Similarly, fellow tourists are great for temporary companionship.

7) ""Planning is invaluable

8) Make a list of things before you leave that are crucial to not forget.  It's too difficult to try to remember everything you should have packed, what's irreplacable.  Keep it under 7 items, and at least once a day, check that you have all X# of items.  For example, mine usually includes cell phone, wallet, passport, phone charger, you can replace your undies

9) Not applicable for some, see if they have an alumni network in the country you're visiting and, if you're lucky, maybe they'll have an event.  It's a perfect way to meet people who a) speak your language b) you have something in common with and c) who you can easily befriend based on similar interests and experiences.  This can also be true in some cases through embassies, consulates or high commissions.

10) Number 10 but perhaps most importantly, your SO, your responsibilities.  Enjoy the liberation attached with traveling alone.  You can go wherever you want, whenever you want.  You can sleep in, get up early, go to bed early, get hammered

Anyway

For five more months.

I've felt lost in life and out-of-sync with my setting for the last couple of years, I saved up my money, and I've started to make it a reality. It will be a reality, in fact. However, it seems like ever since I bought my ticket, I've become almost completely disconnected from my life as it is now. I've become less social and more jaded, life feels ever more complicated and I feel more confused all the time.

I still believe that the right thing for me to do is to go and see the world, in a nutshell). Without going into pain-staking detail (unless you ask), I've set in motion for myself a globe-trotting experience that I hope will profoundly affect my perspectives of myself, the world, and I suppose everything else too. Now that it actually all seems to be coming together, I've begun to fear that the only thing that will change is the scenery around me and the language that I hear in a day.

I traveled thrifty.  I learned all the supermarkets on the island and where to score deals at them.  I learned where the deli put its stuff on sale in each grocery store when it was near expiry.  I got a job doing some light website work I did on my laptop at starbucks or McD.  I made a couple friends I'd stay with here or there, go buy 8 bananas for $1 and that's breakfast and lunch.)

**Transit**

Hitchhiking can be tricky but was mostly wildly successful; Probably 100 rides with no serious danger to report.  Mostly nice folk who will share bud!  The heleon bus goes all around the island

This was usually entirely alone; no one in site (where I'd camp.)  I'm a very wary traveler.  I will chat up in a hostel

Two swimsuits (the only bottoms I needed; one to wear while the other dries; no need for underwear, goggles, map of the island, water, an empty box-wine bag for a pillow or backup canteen, a small ""pak-lite' sleeping bag I got for $4 from goodwill there, a tarp, socks, sunscreen

The problem is more or less that my parents think that it would make me too self-dependent. They're worried that I will have difficulty making a social life in college because I will have matured so much on my trip (this sounds like the crappiest logic ever). I'd see everyone as being too immature or something and would therefore have difficulty getting along with them. There is probably a more logical reason for why they don't want me to go on this trip but this is all they've told me. I find it especially strange that they're holding me back when all of my other siblings have done a gap year.

P.S. Should I start in SEA and make my way 'down' or start in New Zealand and go up.

But maybe I should start in Nepal? I have some friend in SEA who will be there then so I'm tempted to start there.

You get the idea. Would such a service have a demand? Would parents use this service to reassure themselves of their child's first trip overseas? All opinions are welcome here folks.

I've had this feeling ever since I was a kid and I've always had a hard time explaining it to other people. Basically I just want to hop on a motorcycle with the bare essentials and take my life one day at a time. See what happens.

The problem is that I know it would be irresponsible of me to do this. I don't have a degree (only about half way through school at the moment), miss years of life with friends and family that I'll never get back and ultimately nothing tangible will be gained (the only thing I'll have is stories to tell and a bit of real world experience). 

On top of that I'm pretty sure this decision would be met with resistance from my family and friends who certainly would see it as a bad decision that would only set me back in life. So I'm not even sure I'd tell them that I was leaving... I'd rather just go before they tried to convince me otherwise.

My plan is to finish up my AA over the next year or so, no plan, no path. Just the open road ahead of me.

There is a life story that goes with all this but it's mostly boring so I won't go into too much detail. Let's just leave it at this... I'm a 26 year old male who manages a liquor store full time, a comfortable life in a 'not-too-big' but 'not-too-small' town, exercises on a daily basis and generally lives a comfortable life. 

But I'm not happy. And I've made mistakes that certainly involve one very beautiful, boring and cliche).

going to college sport events and parties; and
maybe meeting/seeing some famous people.
Also

I know this may sound like a shallow trip, demanding corporate job. I wholly intend to come back for a more cultural and holistic trip when I am older and probably married.

The destinations of my trip are likely to be as below:
LA &gt; San Francisco &gt; Seattle &gt; New York &gt; LA.

Can anyone help me out with my worries or give me some tips on anything or anywhere that I am going to in the US?

I'm a man in my late-20s, and have been to Mexico once for a vacation. I hike and backpack locally frequently.

I'm trying to figure out if I should explore my home country or branch out. I've got a few thousand USD saved

Thailand has the advantage of being cheap from what I understand. I can stretch a dollar a long way. I can also travel to Australia or up through Asia into Europe by mostly-foot. Though I'd have to start with a flight which cuts out a non-trivial amount of my savings. (~$600)

South America (Brazil &amp; Chile specifically) has the advantage of being reachable by foot alone and I know enough Spanish to get by. I'm a little hesitant about crossing the US-Mexico border

Of course, and the potential to provide a whole new outlook from the eyes of a backpacker around places I've already been.

It just doesn't stop.

I know that I will more than likely experience material loss. It's just really starting to dawn on me that I will actually be living out of a fabric backpack for the foreseeable future, c'est la vie.

My trip will be for three months where at first i'll be flying to Toronto, San Fran, San Jose, Yosemite/Lake Tahoe, LA and San Diego. 

From San Diego I will be flying across to Houston

My main aim is to just explore and have fun

My total budget for the trip is around $6000 dollars so I hope that covers me for the entirety of it. So my question for everyone here is are there any last minute preparations I need to take that I may have overlooked? are there any suggestions people have to add to my trip or improve my time backpacking? Or any words of wisdom from experienced travelers will be hugely appreciated! 

Thanks

I'm traveling there for two months and, although I don't have my exact itinerary or travel plans worked out yet, I have an idea of what I want to do:

New York - Providence - Boston - Washington

1) Accommodation - I've booked for a hostel in New York and a motel in providence. Are hostels and motels always the best option for budget-conscious solo travelers? And would it be okay if I booked as I traveled

2) Transport - I'm worried about this one. Being 18 makes it incredibly expensive to rent a car. Buses and trains seem fine along the East Coast

3) What websites / apps / methods would you recommend for me to make accommodation and transport bookings?

After a sitting on google maps for a few hours, El Paso on Saturday night, Roswell on Sunday night, before making a speed-run back to Louisiana all day Monday.

After getting off work on Thursday

I woke up early Friday morning and after grabbing some coffee and gas, parked my car and worked my way across the downtown to [check out the Alamo](http://i.imgur.com/Y4MNbh.jpg). After a little more wandering, I [followed the River Walk](http://imgur.com/a/6YEAO#27) back to my car. By 6PM, I was on the road towards Del Rio. As I passed through the town of Hondo, I grabbed some really [good Mexican food](http://i.imgur.com/AZGd4h.jpg) from [Azteca Restaurant](http://i.imgur.com/50RBqh.jpg). I made it to Del Rio around 10PM.

The next morning, save for a handful of villages with a dozen or so people each. When I [made it to Sanderson](http://i.imgur.com/PcHUMh.jpg), I topped off my tank and took advantage of cell-phone service to send a few photos to my mom, and then left for Marathon to the west. At the town of Marathon, I [turned south](http://i.imgur.com/o3GHlh.jpg) towards [Big Bend National Park](http://i.imgur.com/U0Xsyh.jpg). From the welcome center near [Emory Peak](http://i.imgur.com/Ae7dTh.jpg), I took the 40 mile [scenic drive](http://i.imgur.com/COjRgh.jpg) to Santa Elena Canyon, but [just before the end](http://i.imgur.com/nF2RSh.jpg), because many of the flowers were in bloom due to the recent rainfall. A park ranger had told me that this was the first rainfall in over a year. The blocked roadway didn't stop me. I climbed up a small hill next to the road to get a [better view of the canyon](http://i.imgur.com/ff0gzh.jpg). On the [way out of the park](http://i.imgur.com/qxPWlh.jpg), they invited me to go grab dinner with them on Monday night while passing through (I ran too late, continued to the town of Marfa

The next morning, Mexico](http://i.imgur.com/0X7YSh.jpg). This had to have been one of the [most surreal things](http://i.imgur.com/svL94h.jpg) I've ever done. I spent about an hour in Juarez, never straying [more than four or five blocks from the bridge](http://i.imgur.com/CVharh.jpg). The US customs agent called me crazy when I headed back. Once I got back into my car, I went north to Las Cruces, then east to [White Sands National Monument](http://i.imgur.com/m6rYAh.jpg). I took the [drive around the park](http://i.imgur.com/UeF6uh.jpg), [walked up some dunes](http://i.imgur.com/NUIVPh.jpg), bought some souvenirs at the welcome center, everything in the forest was [green, with the mountains transitioning to long rolling hills before leveling off into land [flat enough to rival the terrain in South Louisiana](http://i.imgur.com/CTFHgh.jpg). In Roswell

On Monday, where I made a [last-minute detour to the caverns](http://i.imgur.com/aAwEOh.jpg). I put myself on a guilt-trip over the idea of passing it up (I really didn't have enough time), but *caved* at the idea of how much I'd regret not going. At the visitor center, I took the elevator down to the caverns. Because I arrived early, there really wasn't a line to get in. I walked the [big room trail](http://i.imgur.com/VKvxeh.jpg) and then, because I always like a physical challenge, decided to take the natural route to get out. Although the signs said that the 1.2 mile route should take between 1 and 2 hours, stopping only in Fort Stockton

I just graduated and plan on travelling to Europe for 3-4 weeks this summer before starting grad school and I’ve been doing a lot of research and preliminary planning (like getting my passport). I’m a little nervous since I’ll be backpacking by myself, I plan on staying primarily in hostels/couchsurfing to save money. I’m obviously trying to keep costs cheap/reasonable, but this is a big, one-time splurge of mine.

In terms of deciding where to go/what to do and then actually doing everything like booking visas, I’m a little overwhelmed. Any tips on how long to stay in different places, rail passes, hostels, couch surfing, packing, etc. would be awesome. Below I’ve listed some of the trip information to help anyone with suggestions. Like I said, but have the flexibility to extend it slightly.

I’ll most likely fly into (and maybe out of depending on price) of England or Ireland and work my way into the rest of the EU from there, and but I’d like to have a decent mix of the “big name-touristy” places and the “off the beaten path” rural locations. Obviously I know that I can’t see everywhere, but I want to make the most of my trip and at least see Rome, London, and Paris. Nightlife is important, but not a deal breaker if the place itself is incredible. For example, I think seeing Lauterbrunnen Valley in Switzerland would be incredible, especially if you can do something active to get there (bike/hike). If possible

**Tentative Departure Date:** Tuesday 7/16/2013

**Estimated Travel Time:** 3-4 weeks

**Budget:** $4000 - $6000 (Is this reasonable?)

**Interests:** Pretty much anything active/outdoors (hiking, swimming, sports in general), reading (mostly fiction) cooking/food/nutrition, meeting new people, science/engineering, aviation, history

My one and only goal is to pay everything off, and I don't have many possessions, and I'm even less attached to the ones I have (except musical instruments).

I want to travel, camping, little road trips, which I do when I can.

I've recently been accepted for an internship in Israel and I was wondering if I would be required to have a visa for my minimum 6 month stay.  On the Gov website it does say I won't need one as a tourist for 90 days but doesn't go into detail about what happens after that.

**Info about me and my position:**

* U.S. Citizen
* It's unpaid (so no work visa)
* It doesn't qualify for a volunteer visa
* I recently graduated so I'm no longer a student (no student visa)

Do I just go without a visa (like the gov website says?) and then extend my stay before my 3 months is up? Though I'm not sure what they would be extending since they won't have any paperwork.

...or do I apply for a tourist visa (even though it's not required) and then extend that after.  Not entirely sure where I fall here in terms of visas since I'm not a tourist. I've been trying to google this info for a while now to no avail.

I have some questions pertaining to my tentative itinerary

I want to arrive in Edinburgh (2 nights), Paris (3 nights), Angers (3 nights), Antwerpen, Belgium (1 night), Maastricht, Holland (3 nights), The Hague (4 nights), go home from Prague. 
I have purposefully scheduled quite a few nights in Holland because my mother was born there, the cities aren't too far from each other.  But since this country holds some personal meaning to me, I want to stay there for a bit longer than other countries.  Should I schedule more nights in other bigger cities?  I figure when I'm in Den Haag I'll visit  Delft since it's close by, and Rotterdam, etc.  Does this sound like a solid itinerary or where should I make some tweaks?

Also, France is not apart of the deal, so that makes things complicated.  If I were to fly into Edinburgh, traverse south to London (using the Eurail??), then taking the chunnel to Paris, train to Angers, train to Antwerpen, then Berlin

At this point

Finally, but just curious if there any basic tips. :) (Aside from the obvious, like don't go walking by yourself at night, etc.)

Quick back story, in an ambulance, as a hazardous construction medic, search and rescue, and in the emergency room. Before that I worked on cars, computers, did handyman work, and popped residential and commercial (semi-legit) locks for a living. I've got to see and do alot of cool shit with my life, friends

Recently my EMT/Paramedic license expired. I don't have any other licenses or certifications. I don't really have the cash or desire to re certify in this particular field. Most medics in this town (Las Vegas) make less than 14 an hour, but politics and cash have made it exceptionally hard for me to keep going. I feel like my life is falling apart and I don't have the money to go back to school, so life has gotten pretty depressing. 

As soon as I heard myself say this, and my affairs are in order. I have spent alot of time browsing this sub-Reddit as well as others, and I believe I have everything I need for getting around. I have made a list of things I have going for me and things I have going against me. 

**Going for me**:

1) I have acquired an amazing variety of skills that I have grown competent in over the years. I can do EMS, fix computers, fix most basic electronic devices, hang drywall, almost anything with construction including safety, plumbing, some carpentry, teach archery and CPR, none of this is 'official'. Also

2) I have no strong needs for 'quality of life'. I don't mind sleeping outside, bathing in sinks, sleeping in sleazy area's surrounded by less than desirable characters. I've stayed in areas so bad that I have been stabbed in the face, in the shoulder, and in the stomach. It hurt like hell, but its not something that I freak out about. Its life, right? Just another story. 

3) I am great with making new friends and telling stories. More than once here in town I have went to a dive bar alone and wound up crashing at a new friends house. 

4) I am fantastic with quick-thinking/working things out on the fly. I have a nose for getting both in and out of trouble, I don't want to be starting shit in foreign countries, it seems rather disrepsectful on my part. 

**Going against me**:

1) I am leaving with 2000 dollars in my pocket

2) I have no solid plan, and then just roam. I have no way back, and once the money runs out, I know I am probably screwed. 

3) I am diabetic. I have good control over it

4) I really have no strong sense of self-preservation left anymore. I have seen alot of death and alot of life in my time. I would be lying if thoughts of suicide (lots of EMS personnel wind up committing suicide at middle ages) haven't crossed my mind. But I believe this to be inherently stupid because I have no idea what the rest of the world is like

5) People are telling me that this is 'running away'. I have no real response to it because on some level


I am taking a small/medium military 35-liter pack that I can fit 2 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of socks in, as well as a pretty small but spiffy med-kit for real emergencies (not first aid) (I will always be a medic first). I have a roll up hammock that compresses to a 2x2x2 square that I used to sleep in when I was homeless. Plus a towel, some rope, a fold-able 6x4 foot canvas sheet, a good knife, and a leathermen. There's enough room for about 2 days worth of food and water (stuffed it with Ramen and 3 quarts of water)

So, either illegitimate or legitimately? Most of all, do you think I can find a purpose out there, something to change my perspective? I don't want to see the touristy crap, I want to travel through rural areas, learn some culture and language, do and see things I haven't done before. 

Please, concerns, or criticisms. All input is welcome, and I thank you in advance.

I know there is a lot of these type of posts so hopefully I will give enough information to help map out my trip! I plan on quitting my job later this year to backpack around SE Asia for 4 months from November-March with a budget of ~$6000 USD excluding plane ticket. 

First of all

I know I want to visit Thailand, Indonesia, and The Philippines but I'm not sure where to start, or which cities to see/skip. I am an artist, in shape, practice yoga, very easy to talk to and sociable, I enjoy drinking and partying (defiantly going to check out the Full Moon Party) but can't do it everyday (introvert at heart wearing an extrovert mask) and would like days where I am just sitting on the beach sketching the beautiful landscapes/architecture. 

Things I'm interested in:

-Hiking/trekking/water rafting/surfing

-Yoga Retreats

-Museums

-Temples

-Beaches (duh) 

-The Full Moon Party

So I would love any suggestions from experienced SE Asia travelers for a loose itinerary for me to start planning because I really want to book my plane ticket soon :) I'm sorry if the info I gave is still too general

1366072876.0,1cffhg,F/24 looking for some travel guidance.,woodsy0912,9,0,8,"Ok guys
Some stats: I am a 24 year old female with no children and no significant other. I recently graduated college with a degree in Biology. I am not currently using that degree for anything. I am working part time for my parents business.
I have been job hunting for the past year to put my degree to use. Been feeling panicky about my future and I have no idea what direction I want my life to go. 
I have just about paid off my school loans and should have about ten grand saved up by the end of summer. 
I have lately been coming to realize that there might not be a need to rush out and get the 9-5 office job. I have no attachments at the moment and my retirement is pretty much set due to my parents finance planning. This in itself might give me a little more lee-way in life decisions than some other may have. 
I have now been considering an extended stay out of the country for a few months to shake up my life and maybe find out more about myself and what I really want out of life. The time to do something like this would be now while I am not held back by anything. 
I really can’t say exactly what I it is want to do. I am not looking for a magic answer but maybe someone else has gone through this and can give me some words of wisdom. 
I am interested in places in the Caribbean (I am a certified scuba diver and love all things beach), UK, but I am open to all ideas. I would want to stay a few months and maybe snag a part time job to keep me afloat. (Bringing some set-up money with me of course). Maybe I would love wherever I go and move there forever, maybe I would have a terrible time and come home, or maybe I would discover new things about myself and come back knowing more about myself. 
TLDR: I am a girl who needs a change of scenery
Thanks for letting me get it all off my chest. I feel so very confused about all of this sometimes.

1365181991.0,1bqst4,"(Update) 10 day ultra-ultra-light weight traveling in early March Spain, Italy, Croatia. Anyone else tried to travel through Europe with no baggage?",SuicideNote,9,10

I'll make this as to the point as I can. The original plan was to quickly traverse Spain

What I carried from the US:
1) one pair of low cut wool socks.
2) Sperry's (shoes)
3) one pair of boxer-briefs
4) Levi's jeans.
5) Belt
6) Undershirt
7) Button-up shirt
8) Jacket
9) Scarf and (10)gloves

Aside from clothes I brought these items.

11) Passport
12) Money clip (Wallet)
13) Debt Card
14) Credit Card
15) Driver's License (useless I know)
16) phone (plus charger)
17) Point and shoot camera (no charger)

My trip: Landed in Madrid, renfe to Toledo on the 4th. Planned to head throughout Andalusia but only made it to Cordoba (5th and 6th day) before I met up with a long time German friend in Valencia (7th, 8th, 9th day). She recommended a decent hostel in Barcelona so I took an early morning renfe to Barcelona on the 10th day and stayed for the rest of my trip and holy s*** was that hostel crazy. 5 day or so bender with day time sightseeing and maybe 4 hours a day worth of sleep. 

How did I fare? Okay. I'm genetically disposed not to sweat a lot and with daily showers I didn't really smell. Had to replace the undershirt and underwear several times (H&amp;M, Carrefour) and I did one pair of laundry in Barcelona. I also did away with the socks after Madrid since well I'm wearing Sperry's. The worst part of the trip was shaving since I can grow an epic beard in days. I mostly borrowed shaving cream from Americans but I had to buy shaving sticks now and then and so. Eventually I just grew a beard and just shaved my neck.  

Things I noted:

Airport security did not care that I didn't bring any bags, the only time anyone asked about my lack of baggage was at immigration and customs at JFK on my return flight. ""You're not carrying any bags, sir?"" ""Nah, light weight travelling"" And I was on my way.   

Sperry's are no good on cobbled streets

Renfe Turista Plus is far superior to Turista coach for not much more. 

Mexican churros superior to Spanish churros

Spain is awesome overall and very tourist friendly. 

Spain is cheap compared to France or England or northern Europe. 

Spain is very cold February and early March. It [snowed in the Andalusia region](http://imgur.com/jKtcqwy)! It didn't warm up until the last few days of my trip. 

WHY I WON'T DO IT AGAIN: 

1) Even though I travelled by myself I never really was by myself since I did only hostels and I always found myself with groups of fellow travellers where ever I went. Segovia, Cordoba I grouped up with some Germans and Portuguese, Valencia Americans, Barcelona I stayed for so long that I tagged along with 4 or 5 groups. Honestly, when I'm with company I like to impress.

2) Sightseeing, consecutively, in the same jeans and jacket. You just feel dirty and no amount of showering will fix that. 

3) Girls. Girls. Girls. Aussies, Brazilian, Americans, and a few of Canadians. I met so many women and I looked like crap or at least I felt like it. On my last leg of the trip I met the cutest Canadian girl in the world, well 3 super hot Canadians, but only one that flirted with me--I guess some girls are into that bearded, rugged hobo look. Haha. This girl had the most charming smile and Canadian accent. I could melt. But it was two days left on my trip, grumpy

I'm an 18 year old high school senior getting ready to graduate and enter the real world come June. I am fortunate enough that much of my University will be covered from the scholarships I've recieved and my parents' savings

I have a love for history, and so I'd love to travel Europe for 6 to 8 weeks. I'm well aware that travelling solo is at times terrifying and nervewracking, but the general notion is that its for the better; that in the end it will be alright and it will help me mature.

But am I in too far here? I've never lived on my own, its obvious that most of my life has been orchestrated by my parents and I haven't had to worry about too much.

I'm thrilled by the adventure of travelling alone, and people in places so far away from home. Its definitely something I am 100% confident in doing, but am worried that it could just be my invincible teenage over-confidence speaking, and that perhaps I need to be able to live on my own, and become more independant, before I throw myself into this tempting ocean of adventure.

Eventually, up to very serious charges like drugs or even worse a sex crime.

Someone will eventually get arrested in a foreign country. The reason I am writing this post

I AM NOT A LAWYER

I was recently arrested in Europe

So. Here it goes.

If you are arrested overseas

1.  STAY CALM. This may seem like common sense advice, it can be a very stressful ordeal. STAY CALM. Take a deep breath, no matter WHAT you will be OK! I promise.

2.  You have the OPTION to cooperate with the Police. While this is generally PERCEIVED as a good thing, I would ask for a lawyer WHEN ONE IS OFFERED.

3.  You have a right to a LAWYER and to contact the Embassy in whatever country you are in. The right to contact the AMERICAN EMBASSY is ALMOST as inalienable right as an attorney. ASK POLITELY to CALL THE EMBASSY. ASK POLITELY for a lawyer. This is a UNIVERSAL RIGHT in MOST countries
If you are held for an extended period of time: STAY CALM. Once you have an attorney, but it is all you can do. A Consular Agent from the American Embassy WILL make contact with you FACE TO FACE.
HOWEVER ALL THE EMBASSY CAN DO IS ENSURE THAT YOU ARE BEING TREATED THE SAME AS A PRISONER OF THE HST COUNTRY. TELL THE CONSULAR AGENT WHO CONTACTS YOU EVERYTHING!!! TELL THEM YOUR SIDE OF THE STORY. TELL THEM ABOUT THE CONDITIONS IN YOUR JAIL. TELL THEM EVERYTHING. The Consular Agent will have you sign a Release of Information form. This form allows the Consular Agent to make and stay in CONSTANT contact with your family regarding your status and your case.

4.  Finally, your Family, the American Embassy, and your lawyer KNOW where you are, and care about you.

If you know someone that has been arrested in a foreign country, and I will help you out.

""But loneliness can turn hotel rooms into depressing cells. And meals for one are often served in a puddle of silence. Big cities can be cold and ugly when the only person to talk to is yourself.

I'll post the packlist in the comments.


So!  I'm leaving at 10AM tomorrow for Tokyo.  I have 21 hours of flying to look forward to!

I really don't have anything planned at all.  I'll be staying in hostels but I haven't booked anything yet.  I got the Japan Rail Pass, what are some MUST-SEE places in Japan?  Obviously I will see Tokyo/Kyoto/etc.  

After 2 weeks there I'm flying to Thailand.  For some reason I'm way more nervous about finding my way around Japan than Thailand.  

I guess I don't really have any specific questions so this whole thing is kind of pointless

Just wanted to thank you guys for your help (I posted back when I bought my plane ticket as well).  This really is a great community of people-- hope to meet some of you while I'm travelling!

Anyway ANY tips regarding Japan or Thailand (or Cambodia) are very appreciated.  Anywhere that you went that just blew your mind or nice quiet spots or places where you met wonderful people-- I'm open to any sort of story or suggestion and will read every reply carefully!

Also open to crits regarding the stuff I'm bringing :p

EDIT:  Oh one thing I forgot-- thoughts on Hiking shoes?  They're not pictured but I have a really nice pair of Vasque hiking shoes that are super comfortable but they're bulky and heavy (especially for low-hikers).  I've thought about strapping them to the outside of my pack

edit2:  Also a tip for others.  I managed to get (a little last minute) a Charles Schwab debit card (you have to sign up for a brokerage account too but it's free) which charges no ATM fees anywhere in the world.

Ultimately, but didn’t think I had the money and wasn’t ballsy enough to go out on my own just after turning 18. But after all this bullshit and living alone for a solid 3 months, I feel more prepared to go out alone.

These are the main ""guidelines"" that I've set for myself so far.

* I am hoping to maintain a budget under 3000 dollars. It looks that I can fly into Berlin for a minimum of 1100
* I am highly proficient in German and am learning Italian from a friend second semester
* The main things I want to see are, so I’ll definitely make some stops in big cities, but for a limited amount of time. 

So here are the things I need help with… 

* I feel like I have this idealized version of travel in my head
* Do you think approximately 2000 bucks is a reasonable estimate for about 3-5 weeks over there? I plan on only buying food and shelter, something as stupid as going to the top of the Empire State building is over twenty dollars. Is touristy stuff overseas equally overpriced?
* For anyone who’s backpacked/biked long-distance
* And finally

I'm 29, nothing really holding me back. I have assets in total slightly shy $1m, of which about $100k is available to me the remainder will continue to become available to me throughout my life at specified ages. Not self made, I was born lucky. This post is not intended to brag or rub it in in anyway. I feel like I've been blessed with a great opportunity and if all I used it for is to buy a bigger house, nicer car, splurge on more expensive week-long trips here and there it would be a waste, and something I would regret latter in life, having children etc.

My dilemma is that I love to travel, and I find little fulfillment in my career, and honestly it stresses me out, although I have excelled thus far and have been at it for 6 years and have quickly been climbing the corporate ladder. I work for a competitive international company. I feel compelled to work for all the wrong reasons, to amass wealth, things, and spend on things that help ease the stresses of my lifestyle. Fortunately

I'd like to hear from another former professional/trustfunder who indefinitely put their traditional life on hold to travel the world. Was it worth it? My fear is that I'd have instant regret and sadness. I currently have an awesome support system at home with great parents, cousins.  What did your friends and family think? How did they cope with your change in lifestyle? What did your employer think-if things didn't work out on the road did they take you back? Did any investment opportunistic come up during your travels and did they pan out? Did you find you're able to pick up odd jobs to support your travels or did the day to day travelling not put a big enough dent in your bank account to warrant picking up odd jobs? 

I know a lot of people are reading this thinking that this guy is an idiot and would in a heartbeat hit the road with this amount of cash and never look back.  But this is a very tough decision for me. I've flirted with it for years, but then what's the point of living a laid back life at home when I could do it on the road instead?  Or is there a happy medium that can be achieved? Work seasonally in the US and travel when not working. I live in the states so cross ocean flights are expensive. 

Any advice, or observations of others in my position would be helpful. Thanks!

Edit: Just to be clear. When I say ""travel"" I really mean living abroad. Moving around from hotel to hotel would get costly fast and I would exhaust my funds much faster than I would intend-like so many travelers often do.  I Would probably like to establish a base and stay for a least a month or two at a time (of course with trips along the way).

I'd also love to spend some time in quaint, and even take a few hikes to places like the Bastei and through Schwarzwald.

This is a throwaway as i do not want some people to know about this excursion.

I won't bother you with reasons, and a ""future"" ahead of me...  Anyway, fuck all that jazz, i am receiving a decent amount of money in around 1 year due to some incidents that occurred when i was younger.  Enough to set aside a decent chunk to pay off student loan payments, and have a fair amount to travel for a decent amount of time (depending on how i squeeze it).  I've been burdened by the weight of monthly student loan payments and have not been able to do anything i've wanted too simply because i am required to have a regular income to pay this off.  But no more!

I am considering visiting southern chile/argentina for the climate and gorgeous scenery.  I've got northern blood and can't stand the heat.  Does anyone have any experience travelling around some of the more rural regions of southern chile and argentina?  What is the attitude toward's visitors (specifically from the US)?

I plan on going to South India to teach English at a local school, Serengeti and Kilimanjaro (among other places), and maybe I'm going to visit Zanzibar too. I'll be in Africa for 2-3 months (as it looks right now). After that I'm going to fly to Santiago in Chile where I want to travel north through Bolivia (I'm know very little about Bolivia - some people say that it's the nicest place they've been, while others say that it's very unsafe and risky to go there) into Peru where I want to see Lake Titicaca and Machu Picchu. I'm going to be in South America for 2-3 months too. Then from Lima, Peru I want to travel to Mexico City and spend some time there. After that I don't know if I'll go straight home again, if I'll explore the Caribbean or if I'll work some time around Denver at a couple my father lived with when he was an exchange student in the US.

The first three months in India I have accommodation, but it's not 100% sure.

I'm a boy from Denmark, Nepal, and Africa I'm going to travel with a friend, and from there I'll continue alone - maybe I'll meet a friend or two in South America. I'm from Denmark, so because of the Danish price levels it'll probably be cheap for me no matter where I go (I think).

I'm gonna bring my camera (a Canon 7D or 5D Mark III), but I REALLY need it - I do a lot of photography and it's one of the things I look most forward to doing on the trip. You can see some of my photos [here](http://www.thomasflensted.blogspot.com).

Apart from that I'm going to bring the usual clothes and shoes

I will carry everything in a backpack. I would like advice on backpacks too.

I (male, but haven't figured out the details.

I have been to India 3 times before since 1998 and fell in love with it. Since then it has always been my dream to experience the slight shifts in culture by going there overland instead of just flying there.

So far I have thought of 3 possible routes:

* Easy: Balkans, Pakistan, India
* Intermediate: make a detour from Iran to Turkmenistan and Usbekistan (I'd *love* to see Samarkand)
* Hard: go all the way around through Tajikistan to Pakistan (do I have to cross Afghanistan or can I go through China?)

Has anyone here ever done something like that before?

1. Should I book everything before hand: galapagos tours, flights, antarctica cruise

2. Should I pay for a tour of machu picchu or do you think I will be able to do it on my own with my guide book?

3. What else is there in Ecuador other than Otavalo

With that being said...

I've spent nearly 21 years living along the same stretch of highway, and now I've either found a catalyst to leave or a lack of catalyst to say. I've made up my mind to go wander the world.

I'm going to be confined to my lease at this apartment for another 10 months (exactly), it will take me to every continent except Antarctica. I intend to essentially live out of a backpack as I make my way from city to city and hostel to hostel, across the world or as far as I can make it. I will be coasting on the kindness of strangers when it comes to transport and food, and hopefully only spending money when I absolutely have to buy a train ticket or a meal.

So for those of you who have done something like this

1. What do I need to be carrying with me on a daily basis in my pack? Some things are obvious; stove, boots, gear, computer, travel documents, etc... I'll have 70L of space to work with, and I don't know how to make totally optimal use of it.

2. Given my proposed method of travel, the cheaper it is, and if I'm planning on seeing as much of the world as possible, then I don't mind going slowly and devoting years to the endeavor. 

3. What do I need to avoid? I've heard that people are often surprised by what comes their way when they open themselves to the kindness of strangers, but I do also know that something like what I'm planning requires foresight.

4. This one is much more open: what else do I need to know? What didn't I ask that I need to know about? I'm not sure how long I'll be traveling or how much of it will be alone - that scares me

TL;DR: I've got big plans to see the world

Pretty much what the title says, what to wear and what exactly I'd like to do. More importantly I don't have an estimate on how long I should stay there.

I’ve decided a month should be reasonably long and enough. Here’s a breakdown of the itinerary:


**Ushuaia: 2-3 days** (I’d like to hike the Martial Glacier and see the tierra del fuego park as well as take the train)
 
**El Calafate: 1-2 days** (visit the Perito Moreno Glacier)

**Puerto Madryn: 1-2 days** (would like to see the penguins and dive with the seals)

**Bariloche: 11 days** (This is one of the major highlights where it will involve a lot of activities such as hiking and trekking. I would also greatly appreciate places to go

**Iguazu Falls: 1-2 days** (I’d keep it to 1 day since I’m only there to see the falls.. not sure if there is anything else to do aside from the falls.)

**Buenos Aires: 11 days** (this is the second major highlight of the trip. It is not nature oriented obviously however here is where I’d like to look to go for some urban exploration

By getting within these destinations

Next comes to my problem of gear in terms of backpack and clothing:
Given the weather difference between Patagonia and upper Argentina

I’m also unsure of what boots I should buy that is both suitable for Patagonian weather and possibly everyday outings (unless I could have with me a boot and shoes for when walking around the cities). This would also include clothing as well. I’m actually from a middle eastern country and wintery clothes aren’t available here so I’ll have to resort to purchasing them online and hope for the best. I would really appreciate any tip to help me out. Any recommendations, I’m quite introverted but can socialize, and I’m taking this as a solo trip so that I can force myself out of what I’m in).

Just looking for advice/opinions to be honest. I haven't been on holiday for ages

The one place I really loved and still like the look of is Orlando

Everyone has told me I'd be nuts to go alone to Orlando and that during the evenings etc I'll have nothing to do by myself and at the parks etc I'll be feeling lonely with all the family's around. 

My main interest was the parks and there seems to be at least 6 I would go to and possibly others too

My idea was to go at the start of November as I have heard this is a good time to visit as it is a bit quieter than in the summer time for the Parks etc but weather is still nice (compared to UK anyway).

I would say I am very introverted anyway and am fine and usually thrive when by myself, don't eat a great deal so not fussed with missing restaurants in the evenings etc though wouldn't really care of looks etc eating alone.. The Medieval times thing looks like a fun thing to do one evening. 

One of my other questions was about rental cars

I guess I am just looking for peoples opinions on if this is a bad idea or not?

**Reasons for Going:**

- Nightlife/Partying (I and alcohol get along)

- History (was a Hist. major in college for a spell

- Art/Architecture (buildings rock)

- Breaking free of bubble (physical and social); never traveled outside the country except England/Scotland/Wales when I was young and two day-trips to Tijuana. Plus I'm a socially awkward dork.

**Possible Locations:**

- Changing constantly of course, or if I want to depart/arrive from two different cities or loop.

- Definitely Prague/Munich/Budapest. Prague because I've wanted to for years, Americans place too much stock in this) and looking to learn more about those cultures.

**Time/Cost**

- Flights seem cheapish from California (I'm in San Francisco)... around US$1150-1350. 

- Thinking maybe US$2000-3000 in additional discretionary spending

- 2-3 weeks (12-18 days) is probably most I can get off of work.

**Advice?**

- Places to go, etc.

- As mentioned above, not talk to anyone, and have sort of a lonely/bad time. Any fellow awkward peeps have any source material to draw on here?

Putting together an answer, either at home or travelling. 

For people who want to get out there and commence a new journey or for those who need a little inspiration to persist with the journey they have already started.

Even though my mate’s wanderlust for travelling is indisputably strong, well, longer than expected. This by all means is not at all a bad thing either.

I for one certainly don’t blame him. There are that many undeniably awe striking, if not a handful or more of these types of places upon your travels.

Why do we get stuck though? I wouldn’t say we get stuck, all to pack up and leave. 

In saying that though

When it comes time to leave though and that dreaded occasion for goodbyes has arrived. Don’t say goodbye. Instead to those special people you bonded with

So I say pack up

Hello

I have been planning to go to Europe near the end of this year for some time now, but I don't really feel like that would give me enough freedom. I don't really want to be tied to a tour group, even if they offer ""flexible options"" like having days to yourself/friends/etc, they just don't really seem right for me.

On the other hand

Anyway, planning it, etc. I recently planned my own trip to Japan and South Korea with a friend, but this time it involves so many more countries and I will be alone, in a different style of tour.

I'd like to see Oktoberfest (Germany), Netherlands, Poland, Czech Republic, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Denmark

My budget is maybe $3000 (not incl airfares) or so, but at the same time spend enough time in each place so it'd be flexible!

Really I am just a novice at this whole way of travelling (japan I just stayed in hotels and took their awesome train service). Any tips on hostels and such? Basically ANY advice or places to help me book or plan would be amazing.

I can travel anytime from now and the end of the year for 2 weeks.


Where I've done solo-
Scotland, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, Germany

Where I've traveled with husband- 
China, Thailand

I've also traveled across most of the the US/Canada as well.

So any recommendations on where I can go for 2 weeks? I know it's not a lot of time so I might want to focus on a few places

Here's some ideas I have on top of my head-

* Spain/Portugal
* Benelux (Netherlands/Luxombourg/Belgium)
* Ireland
* Eastern Europe (maybe focus in Poland and Czech?)
* Central America (costa rica? belize? nicaragua? panama? not sure which one)
* South America (Peru? Ecuador? bolivia?)

I'd like to go to Africa and more of Asia but I don't think 2 weeks would be enough for such a long/expensive flight.


Things I like/need-

* Natural scenery/gorgeous views
* Interesting museums/historical sights/buildings
* Unique/tasty local eats
* Ability to travel frugally
* Safe for a solo female traveler
* I'm *not* interested in partying/drinking/nightlife.

Thanks!

**Objective (TL;DR)**  

&gt;Searching for the best options to venture outside of Canada/USA for 2 weeks in late August to Early September. I'm a student with a lowish budget that's open to suggestions on destination. England and France seems to have the cheapest entry point.


I'm nervous and I'm scared. I've ventured out only a few times in my life. I need to give myself the kick I need to start breaking out of this bubble of mine and seeing what is out there. I will need help to pull this off though...

I unexpectedly got the time to finally pull a trip this summer. I'll keep this short and sweet!

**Background**:  

* 22 year old Canadian University Student

* First time solo travelling - been accompanied to Germany[x1] and USA[x4] in the past

**Timeframe**  
  
* ~2 weeks - Late August to Early Sept (Can slightly extend a few days if warranted)

**Budget**  
  
*  Lower the better
* ~$2000-2500 **max**

**Desired Destination**  
  
* Flexible. 

Europe will probably be the closest and cheapest.  I love culture and seeing the sights and sounds of a foreign land. I also love seeing nature (Been in the Alps and Rockies!)
  
Cheapest flights I have found are London and Paris

**Request** 

* Where can I go to get the best bang for the buck this late in the season?
* Aside from the links in the sidebar

I know it is late in the season
  
I am working hard on researching and keeping an eye on flight prices. Any help would be fantastic!

--

Now it's 5:23 on 10/18 and im in Kuty Slovakia. Lol I tried to pull a manuv b/c my eurail pass isn't valid in Slovakia but I got pwned.

So I was totally unaware that this pass isn't valid here until I was already in the country and the ticket guy asked for mine. This must have been as soon as we crossed the border from Hungary from Budapest - a city I think I have to come back and visit.

So once the guy told my ticket was bad

I tried to play it off like I fell asleep on the toiled and that I didn't know the ticket was bad. All things considered he was actually pretty nice about the whole thing.

While I was in there

Instead, quiet suburb town. I don't feel threatened one bit but I don't wanna leave the lobb. Turns out a ticket to Praha from here is only 21 euro so I guess I saved myself 50 euro w/ the bathroom maneuver haha.

Ive had a fuckup on every train ride so far

So once I reserved my seat #86 from Munich I found it and was sitting down when this 60+ year old Romanian dude named john came on to the train w/ 4 of the heaviest bags Ive ever seen. He was supposed to be sitting in the seat in front of me

""Moment, that moment turned out to be an 8 hour moment, all the way to Budapest. At first, this guy was pouring sweat and understandably so, his bags were the heaviest ever.

Once we get going for a lil bit he asks me,"" with the accompanying hand motion like he was wafting in the smell of chu ness or something. He would do this hand motion throughout the train ride to signify when he thought something was dominant, like when he went through salzburg and said ""Music the best"" and did the hand thing. Then he asked me if I liked reggae and I said not really.

His name was john and he had a kid my age and offered me a sandwich and started calling me friend and that he liked my name. ""Strong name "" he said.

Turns out he was setting me up for one of the most chu cons of all time. Alex Montana, bro. The worst.""

So I was gonna be a nice guy and help him w/ his heavy ass bags off the train. I tried to tell him I would only help him off the train and that I would help him on the new one but that didn't translate. At one point he asked me to carry his shit for 100 meters.

I ended up lugging that shit for about a quarter mile or even more. Worst thing was our train was late and he had a connecting one with about 15 minutes to make it. 

I could only imagine how funny it must have looked to see me raging and dying as I helped this guy out. Not only did I have to carry my big ass backpack full of shit and my smaller day bag

Eventually I brought him to one car short of where he entered and I just gave up and we had a lil hug and he did the lil euro kiss on the cheek thing. at least he was very appreciative

But that wasn't the end of the chuness. After I sat on a bench for about 10 or fifteen minutes to gain my breath and relax I went to the sketchiest lil eastern european bathroom and took a pill of adderral

Then I exchanged my money and realized how ridic Hungarian forents are. I turned in 70 euro and got 16

After that I tried hella hard to buy a ticket but couldn't. I went to a couple info desks and tried to buy one outside but the machine stole my money and I asked for help  from this hot local girl smoking a cig on a bench but again was lost in translation.

I then went back inside and saw this other automated machine and asked one guy if it was a bus machine and he said yeah. I tried to work it but couldn't

Then I walked outside and called up Dope for help but then I said fuck it and jumped on a bus. I had been on for about 5 min when these 2 huge guys in leather jackets started staring at me and saying something in their native tongue. ""They're gonna try to steal my shit"" I thought.  

Then they busted out these blue armband things and asked for my ticket. I didn't have one so I had to get off at the next stop with them.

""In our country you pay before. This is hungary

Then I explained my situation and he told me the fine was usually 12k but that since I had just got into town he would lower it to 6K.  As it turns out I was on the right bus going the wrong direction. ""This is the old city

So I paid my fine crossed the street and took the next bus to Urbahnia. He gave me a ticket and I thanked him for helping me out.

(Now I have 30 mins til I get on the train to Prague

Once I got off at urbania I asked 2 canadian girls if they knew where my hostel was. They tried to help out but I asked a local guy walking by and he told me it was just another street down. the girls were staying at big fish pub and they seemed like they had a lil inkling to hangout but we didnt and Ill never see them again. from our brief interaction i could tell they were very nice girls.

I finally made it to the hostel, a brunette, helped me initially before Alex took over and took me to the common room.",,False,self,t5_2rxxm,,http://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1cx93c/share_your_journal_stories/

I have been lurking on this sub the past few months and finally worked up the courage to ask a few questions of my own. 

I know this may seem like an odd question

My plan at the moment is to spend a few weeks in a handful of cities and just live

**Transport:**

* Should I buy a Europe Rail Pass?
* Considering my duration
* What are the best cities to fly into? Cheapest?
* Best times to buy? Best day to fly? Is further in advance always cheaper?

**Lodging:**

* Should I reserve hostel spots in larger cities?
* Follow-Up

**Pack and Gear:**

* Can I survive on a backpack worth of clothes?
* Do hostels have laundry services? 2
* Figuring a about 3-4 ""outfits"" worth of clothes (i.e. 3 shirts, etc.)

**Health and Safety:**

* I am 6'4"" (193 cm) generally healthy guy
* Should I talk to my general physician before leaving for shots? How long should that take?
* Health Insurance in case of an emergency, if at all?

**Downtime:**

* I want to get back into reading
* I am an *amateur* photographer
* I assume most hostels have WiFi
* Considering doing a blog to document my journey, any concerns there I maybe haven't foreseen?

**Finances:**

* How much is a ""low to comfortable"" budget? (Assuming airfare

**Language:**

* I did a semester in Spain, should I be concerned?


I have always wanted to travel solo (or at least get some time to just be on my own) and I think it will be challenging. Also I am considering deferring graduate school for a year to do this journey

With that being said, I'm heading east from the US to Dublin, and will begin my trip there by wandering around Europe for the first leg, then hopefully on east to India/Asia, making my way across the Pacific and into South America [I was planning on including Africa, but for safety and financial reasons I think I'm opting out of that]. That is my trip, I would rather wander as I see fit.

The immediate journey will take me to Europe, but over a 3-month does the $1400 Eurail Pass beat them out in terms of value? I'm trying to find the best way to travel cheaply throughout Europe.

Also, though it seems to me that I would have to buy a membership for each new region that I want to be a WWOOFer in. Is that the case?

Finally, and camping gear) worked out for the immediate trip, and as far as food goes, I'm building a budget to minimize food expenses/searching for ways to earn food without spending money. I'm not as concerned about these issues (currently) as I am the travel questions above.

I've never done a trip like this before

TL;DR: What is the most cost-efficient way to travel Europe without restriction, or is it just by region?

I know that this question gets asked pretty much all the time, in Prague for 2 weeks). 

But I'm kinda lost on where would be the best place to go. I'm not that interested in traveling 15 countries

I've been thinking about Hong Kong. What do you think about it? Would I manage in HK without knowing any Cantonese? Is it a nice place to be? And

Do you have any other suggestions besides HK? Nordic countries aren't too much of interest to me this time, so keep the most adventurous options in moderation.  I have a decent budget, but in terms of flights / general costs, places like New Zealand / Australia would maybe be out of question.

As to what my interests are... I'm not that interested in traveling around different sightseeing landmarks. I enjoy just hanging around places if the atmosphere is nice, though not definitely a necessity in any way. Some places and things I liked on previous trips, to give some direction: the hustle and bustle of Chinatown in San Francisco, going to a little movie theater in Prague, some random suburban area in Copenhagen and the little café/kiosk there, chilling around Alexanderplatz in Berlin, the foggy and ethereal landscapes in Scotland.

1351186175.0,122pu4,This is what traveling has inspired me to do...,nealbaren,14,12,8,"I am making music based on my experiences traveling. Let me explain.

About a year ago, having good friends, being able to support myself. But I wasn't...I wanted to be crazy and do crazy things...to not do what I was ""supposed to"", if that makes sense. I felt too in-line, a little ignorant, and too complacent. I'd also had some external pushing to travel from a friend who had done some before.

So I bought a ticket to Colombia without really telling anyone at the time. I'd decided to quit my job. To just...leave. Some time passed, and on December 1st of last year, I flew away to Colombia with little to no plan. I'd always been nagged about making one, so I'd done some rough travel outlines, but they ultimately proved to be absolutely useless. You cannot plan this.

I traveled through Colombia, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina.

I danced Salsa in Medellin, did some Ayahuasca (another tale for another time), hiked a mountain in Quito (almost slipped off of a wet rock wall...not good), explored the jungle in eastern Ecuador, fell HEAVILY IN LOVE with a Chilean girl, surfed in Mancora (pitifully), helped complete the road so our bus could continue going, sandboarded down massive dunes, climbed Machu Picchu (and Waynu!!!), climbed a volcano in Chile

All the while, people, everything. I associate all of this with music, and especially the music I heard while I was there...which I fell in love with. Cumbia, huayno, zamba, other Andean musics...it's all pure and utter MAGIC.

So now, but to try get you to FEEL it...I'm making music. It's also to help me remember something so intense and passionate...this crazy and impossible-to-replicate part of my life that I will carry with me forever. It is an essential part of who I am now, and this music expresses that.

To be even more relevant

So, but I would love if you guys checked out the Kickstarter page where I have two songs and a campaign to raise money (and get fans!) to make it happen and get it out there!
