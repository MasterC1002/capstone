When I heard about the movie, fell in love, adored it, etc. I was a kid, I didn't care about how it was made, the effects, whatever. IT WAS SPIDER-MAN!! Then, but it was (in my opinion) far too focused on soppy romance, even if he wasn't the same guy I read about in the comics. I was older

Fast forward to 2012. I'm 18, I'm a kid again. Andrew Garfield was the *real* Peter! He was a kid, he got bullied, and he was a *nerd!!* I was happy beyond words. Straight after I bought a Spider-Man hoodie; fuck everyone, I can love a superhero, right? The day I watched that movie, I rediscovered a passion and love for the character I thought I'd 'grown out' of. Sometimes, but I don't think they've aged particularly well. They make me smile because they mean a lot to me, and no other *hero*

Spider-Man is, I may do dumb things, mess up with girls, whatever..but that's okay. I'm not Superman.
