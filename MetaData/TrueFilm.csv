1345136777.0,ybu6e,Superbad: The serious approach,imnotblue,323,46,57,"Recently I was about to watch Superbad

But here's my opinion on why it's a great film:  First of all, using dick jokes and ragging on friends as a genuine form of communication. 

These are the kids that grew up watching those embellished 80s and 90s high school movies that showed kids driving beamers to parties with full liquor cabinets, etc.  They have formed in their minds an ideal world where having sex is as simple as party+alcohol+girl=sex.  

The beginning of the movie is constantly reinforcing this misguidedly logical approach

So they spend the bulk of the film pursuing alcohol to get girls drunk in order to have sex.  Even once they're at the party, it's okay, so he goes into the bathroom to swill down some ""sex elixer.""  

By the end, in fact his drunkenness becomes his downfall, literally.  When the cops show up, Hill realizes what matters most is his friendship with Cera, so he saves him.  As they are walking back, they betray their childishness, expressing a desire to have a sleepover and eat pizza bagels like when they were kids. As they fall asleep, something they constantly cover up with dick joke defenses for fear of appearing weak or uncool. 

The next day, without the social lubricant of alcohol.  As Hill rides down the escalator, he looks longingly back at Cera, expressing at once his sadness and his exhilaration at the realization that this is how true relationships are created.  He must leave his comfort zone, his bro, and invest real interest in a woman.  The glitzy dream of Hollywood high school movies is not, in fact

It may be close to my heart because I can so easily relate to all elements of this film, and I find it to be as serious as it is humorous.  Thoughts?

Films from the beginning of the ""talkies"" up until about the mid to late 60's have an especially different flavor. The dialogue is more formal, faces don't seem to be as expressive and the voice seems to carry more expression. Also the actors seem to be much louder or at least their voices carry a lot of weight behind them.

My personal theory is that many of the actors from that era came from theater, a new generation of actors and directors had arrived in Hollywood who were more exposed to film than theater, causing them to shift to a more naturalistic style.

**Latham Hunter** (*The Celluloid Cubicle: Regressive Constructions of Masculinity in 1990s Office Movies*)


_______



Analysis of film on a macroscopic level is something that's always interested me, I think they both reflected this crisis of masculinity faced by the 1990s grey-collar man, and that opened up my eyes to the notion that films might be more than just stories, but rather a reflection of a 'cultural consciousness'. I'm not going to delve too deeply into Fight Club here because people will probably give me shit for it, but I genuinely feel there's an interesting subtext in those films (also present in Office Space and Falling Down) that a lot of people ignore.

^^^please ^^^dont ^^^stop ^^^reading

The 'shared nightmares' approach to horror film analysis follows on from that line of thinking, successful horror film trends can be said to reflect the collective fears ('nightmares') of a society. Frequently, popular horror tropes have beared a close symbolic resemblance to social ills or geopolitical threats.

Take for instance the Kaiju genre (giant Lovecraftian monsters, it's kind of like a schlockier *Animal Farm* (you can find a detailed writeup of kaiju history [here](http://www.historyvortex.org/GodzillaSymbolism.html)).

On the other side of the pond, The Fly, The Incredible Shrinking Man). Later, Hollywood would prey on the 'Red Scare', and the infiltration of radical ideology into American suburbia would manifest as alien invaders (Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Man from Planet X, Invaders from Mars). I read an article wherein the author speculated that the Abu Ghraib scandal was to blame for the rise in 'torture porn' like Hostel, and Saw (I to VII

An important point to make is that this kind of 'cultural consciousness' talk doesn't necessarily imply that we're all part of some greater linked hivemind, it demonstrates that the antagonist or adversary in the film resonates with a large number of people, or a significant slice of society. Of course there are always going to be people who don't find kaiju scary and never will, but you can still draw conclusions about society as a whole based on the fears of a majority. Of course there are outliers too... Pacific Rim is a kaiju film coming out this month but it's existence (and presumably, it's success at the box office) doesn't mean that there's paranoia about nuclear armageddon. -Sometimes a throwback is just a throwback. Early horror films seemed to get by on having some creepy monsters and I can't see any particular sort of symbolic underpinning in werewolves or vampires, they're just scary entities that people eventually grew tired of.

________

Anyway, slowly but steadily unstoppable, many in number, sometimes comical and sometimes vicious... As a disclaimer I'm going to quote /u/fourwordsbackwards when I say 'I'm half bullshitting for the sake of discussion, but are you feeling me?'. Let's discuss anyway:

* **What does the present ubiquity of zombie films reflect

* **Does the huge success of superhero films say something about the dreams and desires of society**

* **What do you think about this whole method of cultural analysis anyway?** Is it just seeing correlations where none exist? In any case

* **What other cinema trends correlate with historical events or the past or present zeitgest?** Anything outside of horror?

* Is anyone familiar enough with contemporary Asian horror cinema and Asian culture to be able to identify some of the trends and speculate on their origin? They seem to have a preoccupation with hair and drains that I've always found completely baffling.

In some ways this has been a good thing for pointing out inconsistencies within films but there is also rampant misuse of the term ""plot-hole"". A ""plot-hole"" should be something which contradicts information given within the film

For example: Looper and The Dark Knight Rises. Firstly, but that wouldn't be relevant. And the fact that it doesn't tell us at least lets us know that it's not relevant and that there must be a reason for it. Not every sci-fi film is Primer so the details aren't always what's important. Similarly the film could detail exactly what happens to the Rainmakers men who (SPOILER) shoot Bruce Willis's wife, but this isn't their story so what would be the point? The film asks us to just fill in the blanks ourselves, which some people sadly find annoying. The film tells us that murder is near impossible so despite their attempts to burn the evidence they're probably screwed. But doesn't that tell us how terrifyingly powerful the Rainmaker must be if his henchmen will still carry out his work even when they know they're done for? Similarly in TDKR, people ask 'How did Bruce get back to Gotham?' even though it doesn't matter. Do we need ten minutes of Bruce Wayne calling in favours or hiding on the backs of trucks just to fulfil some people's need to be told everything? These loose ends should make us think more than they make us dismiss. Like the whole Eagles conundrum in the Lord of the Rings films. It bothers some people that at the end we see how easily the Eagles can fly in and out of Mordor and this makes them ask why they didn't fly the ring there in the first place. This makes some people call the films stupid but it should make people think about why the eagles don't help within the context of the universe. I think the books say that eagles keep away from the lands of men because they would be shot down due to their penchant for sheep. And they steer clear from Mordor whilst the Nazgul and Witchking are still around. Did the films need to tell us that? No, the fact that it doesn't tells us enough. The eagles have a reason for not helping so just enjoy the journey. 


The reason I hate these accusations is because it's such empty criticism. Imagine if we could no longer discuss Citizen Kane because people de-railed the conversation asking who specifically heard him say his final words. Or when discussing Rashomon people get bogged down in asking ""How on earth could a baby have been there the whole time

Does anyone else notice this double standard between older and newer films? Is it just the popularity of these films that makes it seem like most of the ""discussion"" is about plot-holes? Or am I being too forgiving of these films and should we scrutinise every detail? Maybe every sci-fi film should contain Ellen Page's character from Inception so that there's a character that everything can be endlessly explained to and we as an audience won't need to think.

EDIT: I think it is also important to add that these will be the only list/question based posts on this subreddit and any others will be removed.

1359898975.0,17t0v2,[Film Discussion] No Country for Old Men,,199,31,90,"I wanted to take some time and talk about [No Country for Old Men](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Country_for_Old_Men_%28film%29). It's one of my favorite movies

At its core, character motives are made clear, there are no needless scenes of stale exposition, the pacing is at a constant, and we know who everybody is in relation to the story. Those points seem like a given, but many movies fail to cover them all, which ultimately hurts the film. Ambiguity can be a wonderful tool or technique in film, its important that things have finality

Now, you probably shouldn't read this. 

Also, so don't look at this as an educational guide to the film. Instead, consider this a way to show that you *can* drawn these sorts of elements out of a film and make these kinds of conclusions *regardless* of the author's intent. The benefit of being able to do this is that over time, when you see a film that *does* have these elements hidden throughout the film, you'll be able to pick up on them and track them much easier. So try to look at this as merely for entertainment and ultimately for the sake of generating discussion about a few topics.

One final note! Any link to an ALBUM will have descriptions for the photos

First, or an audience expectation, for the protagonist and antagonist of a film. At a passing glance, we can assume that Llewelyn Moss is the protagonist of the film. And why not? He's the first of the main three we see, we're with him the most, the story *seems* to follow him and his ultimate goal, and most of the action seems to revolve around him.

But by the end of the film, and most importantly he is the opposite of Anton Chigurh. Chigurh and Bell are ultimately what the film is about in terms of what they represent. Moss is merely a tool in the story to emphasize the underlining theme of the film which is that death comes for us all. The film is, in many ways, simply a story about dealing with death. Not just dealing it, but *facing* it. So let's start there.

Bell is more than just our protagonist and his character has more depth than simply being a man facing his own mortality. Bell, most obvious and without the need for further explanation, is that he's a sheriff. But there is more to it than that.

Throughout the film we see Bell shown in light colors, we're subconsciously being told that Bell is our good guy, and a representation of good.

[Bell / White / Goodness](http://imgur.com/a/N2GWM#0)

On the opposite side of things, dark environments, and dark clothing. In the most simple of use of symbolism, we're subconsciously being told that Chigurh is our bad guy, and a representation of bad / death.

[Chigurh / Black / Evil / Death](http://imgur.com/a/4nDdO#0)

To further show that Chigurh is death

Duality is something that the Coen brothers love to deal with. A lot of their films death with the idea of contradictions, but they *are* representing two sides of life that are a constant. Good and evil are things that have always existed and always will. Now, I suppose you could make an argument that neither exist in the real world, since the concepts are limited to human life and our perception of the world and how it is filtered through the lens of our laws of morality, but that's an entirely different subject. Let's just assume that here on Earth, there *is* good and evil. They are [connected](http://imgur.com/a/rJSWv#3), and always there. As is death.

And death is an important issue in the film, and is totally right. And we know she is right simply by looking at the character's actions, deaths, and how often things come by surprise.

[What's comin'!](http://imgur.com/a/1Q8Iu#0)

After Bell chooses to face what he believes will likely be his death (when he enters the motel and imagine Chigurh waiting for him)

So much of the movie surrounds the idea that death *will* take you

At the end of the film, and he seems upset by having to say all this out loud. Maybe he doesn't realize what he's dreaming about, but his wife seems to. We do, or we're supposed to. It ties in very well to idea of not seeing it coming versus [knowing](http://i.imgur.com/NODo4fT.jpg) it, and [accepting](http://i.imgur.com/61MxEPI.png) it.

There isn't much I wanted to say about those topics

When Moss is asking about Chigurh, Chigurh makes this [joke](http://i.imgur.com/gBgB8sw.png). He even looks at Caron, a dead body mind you, in feigned [surprise](http://i.imgur.com/q4o2Jwi.png) after hearing how angry Moss is after Chigurh threatened to kill his wife.

Another little detail I love is that we establish that Carson has [seen](http://i.imgur.com/3P3Vnh0.png) Chigurh before. It is later [implied](http://i.imgur.com/jaWgz2U.png) that this on its own is some sort of [accomplishment](http://i.imgur.com/eZW1DUc.png). That idea is further solidified when the accountant asks if he's going to be killed, or at least shed light on, why Chigurh seems to be enjoying [this](http://imgur.com/a/LFRsa#0) moment so much. Carson has seen him and lived, and now Chigurh finally [catches up with him](http://i.imgur.com/9eczLE1.jpg).

Lastly, lighting, and spacial orientation are deliberate (more especially with competent directors and DOPs), so when something tends to show up over and over again, it's fair to assume there is a reason behind it. And even if there isn't a deep meaning behind it, it's fun (I think) to find patterns through a film or even a director's filmography. In No Country, we can see a pattern of [reflections](http://imgur.com/a/6NqHO#0).

Whether coincidence or entirely deliberate

The Coen brothers also have a pattern of showing [shoes and using low angles to show action \(normally people walking\)](http://imgur.com/a/aMoAj#0). I already made a post about it

So anyway, what they represent, and the ultimate point of the film? Is there anything that you've noticed throughout the film that you feel is important or worth mentioning? What do you love or hate about it? And what can be said about using a main character the way No Country does? Bell is in the movie less than Chigurh and Moss (I think), but he's the main character in the sense that it's his story.

1348742497.0,10k2w2,The real problem with Prometheus,Sati1984,200,39,78,"There are many valid complaints about scientist idiocy


To see what I mean
In *Alien*, piece of technology was created with care in regards of being believable. [Verisimilitude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verisimilitude) is the word. **Suspension of disbelief comes easy when a filmmaker so carefully crafts everything in the movie to perfection.** The service corridors were believable, the characters Parker and Brett were believable, and therefore the actions of these characters made sense in context, and were consistent with the characterization up to that point in the plot. (Note: believability does not necessarily mean ""realistic"" in this context!)


*Prometheus* contained no characterization

Let's compare two scenes from *Alien* and *Prometheus*:


In *Alien*


First of all, where there are mindblowing discoveries lie around, scattered randomly. We have just seen a fossilized alien lifeform, weird devices, and a strange hole in the floor which leads to a sort of cargo bay with thin blue mist. Make no mistake: these facts are only partially help you to absorb what is happening in the scene. The other half is direction and atmosphere. This is where *Alien* excels. I can't describe it properly here, you need to watch it.


So Kane goes up to an egg, in retrospect, that was an idiotic move, but there were no clear signs of danger there, and Kane thought his suit and helmet/visor will protect him - resulting in a consistent, believable and logical scene.


Now let's analyze the scene in *Prometheus* where Milburn tries to ""tame"" the cobra-like alien. Right from the start, we know exactly nothing, apart from the fact that he is terrified of alien corpses (which is an understandable character trait, even for a biologist. It's not unbelievable, and the problem is not with that). About Fifield, we at least know that he does not want to make friends, he is only in it for the money. Fair enough


What scenes preceded this encounter? We got a mildly interesting cave-exploration scene (nowhere near the quality of similar sequences in *Alien*), there is another problem with the scene: the cobra-like thing showed obvious signs of pissed off behavior. There is no way a biologist could not pick these up!


Kane gets a pass, we get a lifeform that can only kill, when its prey is dumb enough - I can't write this down without cringing - *to try to pet it...?*


The scene would have worked better if they would have realized the threat and tried to flee the room and the cobra thing would have followed them with incomprehensible speed. That would have been more believable and consistent, and does not have a positive effect on the plot.


This was just one example of how the idiotic behavior hurts *Prometheus* in general. I could write up a similar analysis of the Captain and Charlize Theron scene


**TL;DR: Prometheus has really poorly directed scenes that hurt the plot.**

It's been awesome to see a recent influx in subscribers over the last few days since TrueFilm was featured in a r/bestof post courtesy of our excellent moderator Vocalities and his analogical reasoning. Now seems to be a good time to just reiterate some of the rules around here so new subscribers can get a feel for how this sub is moderated and won't feel too put out if one of their submissions or posts gets deleted.

Firstly
One important thing to remember is that this subreddit welcomes discussion about absolutely any kind of film

The main purpose of this sub is to generate intellectual discussion regarding the medium of film. As a lot of you know r/movies is the most popular film themed subreddit around here and serves Reddit well, you'll fit in around here and, fingers crossed, we shall all hopefully learn something!

If you do want to post a submission here

One question that often gets asked on here is ""How can I learn more about film?!"". Whilst none of us here on TrueFilm claim to be experts on every aspect of the language of cinema

&gt;**Vocalities** *5 points 2 days ago* (6|1)

&gt; A film club is a group of people that agree to participate in the following: vote on a movie to watch, better understand challenging films, and hear unique perspectives.

____

We'll loosely base the 'rules' of the club on the most upvoted and well-received post

&gt; **OneMoreStatistic** *25 points 2 days ago* (25|0)

&gt;1. Every two weeks means a new movie.

&gt;2. Every month should have a theme/topic
 
&gt;* abstract themes like (Revenge, Conspiracy)
&gt;* a film movement (French New Wave
&gt;* the work of a certain director (Kurosawa
&gt;* films from a certain country (France
&gt;* a niche genre (Film Noir

&gt;3. Films should be debated and pushed for which would be the best to watch and why. Any film is under discussion and possible to view just as long as it can be argued to be worth viewing within the context of the theme of the month.

&gt;4. The theme of the month can be chosen by the moderator of the board and/or by debate of the club. If a decision cannot be made a genre is chosen at random by the moderator (or the leader of the club).

OneMoreStatistic originally only suggested abstract themes

&gt;**tomfitzpatrick** *7 points 3 days ago* (7|1)

&gt;I think a mix of director of the month

A major point of contention was how exclusionary to be in terms of film selection, in their own way. Try and suggest films that are reasonably accessible and won't drive away participation, at least until the film club is better established. There aren't many ways to quantify the popularity of a film but let's just exercise our judgement here and upvote accordingly. If this becomes an issue (and I don't think it will), we can implement some firmer rules.

**If anyone has issue with any of these guidelines

edit: However, and film submission votes aren't skewed when attached to a popular opinion on how to run the club, etc. Don't be afraid to post more than once.

__________

I think the simplest way to select films is to have voting threads

Two weeks later, so the next film can be announced inside the discussion thread.

The monthly topic will be decided sometime in the previous month, film submissions, and meta-discussion in separate posts.

Here's a rough template for submission and voting...

&gt;**Title** d. by Movie Director

1361361451.0,18vrbi,The rise of pure CGI scenes and unrealistic camera moves in film,Maxion,184,34,93,"During the past 10 years (probably longer) big block buster movies have been starting to include more and more scenes which are purely done with CGI. Movies such as The Avengers and the Hobbit rely very much upon these scenes where less than 5% of the scene is actually shot with a real camera.

This has given the director the possibility to create wild and crazy camera movements. It's quite common these days to have the camera fly around buildings

This is something which physically cannot be filmed and the camera movement is also one which couldn't be from a PoV of any real person. For some reason

I much prefer the more realistic and sedated camera movements and positions of films from the late 90's and to some degree the early 2000's. I find it much easier to ""get into"" the film world when I'm not treated to these crazy and impossible movements. It somehow feels to me that now when technology has made such movements possible they're done simply because they are possible and not because they add anything meaningful to how the story is told. Technique shouldn't IMO be used just because it's possible.

I'm a photographer and in photography there's a bit of a saying that a photograph is overprocessed when the first thing you notice about it is the technique used rather than the image or subject itself.

There's some consensus on the series strenghts and weaknesses, but it wasn't like that in the book."" That being said, here's my take on the films and their directors.


**Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone**
*dir: Christopher Columbus*

When people don't think highly of the series or dismiss it as kiddy fodder, nothing more.

What it did perfectly though was assemble the cast that

**Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets**
*dir: Christopher Columbus*

Chamber of Secrets continues the success of the first one and while it improves a lot of elements of Stone, but as a result feels a bit more like a rehash of the first than its own unique thing. 

It's my second to least favorite in the series because of just how little it brings to the table in terms of interesting filmmaking. It's still enjoyable

**Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban**
*dir: Alfonso Couron*

It's everybody's favorite, and William's score is probably the best thing he's written since Star Wars. This scene and accompanying music in particular is one of my favorite moments in all 8 films. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VbAt7yDSKs

But Couron doesn't just focus on the pretty pictures, he brings his own stamp to the series. 

A perfect example of this is comparing a scene like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doxxfXqpKYA to a similar scene in Chamber of Secrets http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5qW_UuoTeY . Columbus films things bluntly and locked down. Not terrible


**Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire**
*dir: Mike Newell*

GOF isn't the worst film in the series, and has some of the worst acting in the series. This time it's only more upsetting to me because we'd seen what this series could be. All the elements were in place for Newell to make a great film, but he takes no chances. There are no suprises in the filmmaking in GOF. Everything is as by the numbers in COS only with better special effects and much bigger budget.

What's equally as bland and uninspired as Newell's direction is Patrick Doyle's score. Doyle is a competent composer who's produced some fine soundtracts, but somethings missing.

**Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix**
*dir: David Yates*

Thank God for David Yates. Not only is OotP my favorite of the series, and though overall I'd say Kloves did a solid job of helming the series, Michael Goldberg manages to bring much more thematic weight to the film that at times felt lost in the later movies. The movie's not just a continuation of this complex saga, but more about Harry grappling with his own dark side and choosing to overcome it.

Yates brings a precense from behind the camera that was missing from GOF and he also brought on Nicholas Hooper as a composer to bring back some memorable themes to the Harry Potter universe. No one can replace Williams

A lot of people don't like this movie I think because this is when the series really departs from its fun fantasy roots and starts delving into more complex emotions and adult themes

**Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince**
*dir: David Yates*

If you don't remember what happens in this one, and Dumbledore dies at the end."" 

There's not much to say about the Half Blood Prince other than that it mostly just feels like filler. Yates' voice is still felt, but nothing really happens. The film is really just tying up loose ends and building up to The Deathly Hallows. But it does have some great scenes including this truly amazing set-piece http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6oCIqu_jtE .


**Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows**
*dir: David Yates*

You know when you're a kid and you want a second bowl of ice cream and your mom for some reason is being super nice and gives you another bowl even though she knows she shouldn't. Then you eat too much ice cream and wish you'd only had the one? That's what The Deathly Hallows are to a nerd like me. I appreciate the grandiose of the second part, Yates and crew knocked it out of the park, but still I can't help but wonder if we would have been better off with a leaner, simper 3 hour finale instead of the 6 hour one we got. My only other complaint is the strange decision to remove Nicholas Hooper and replace him with Alexandre Desplat. Desplat has made some great scores, most notably for Fantastic Mr. Fox, but here he's something of a non-entity. The only time he makes an impact is at the end when he's recycling Williams' earlier themes.

1375654571.0,1jpbr3,"My issue with the word ""pretentious"" used during discussion of film.",CaptainBlicero,192,49,114,"I'm not sure if this has already been touched upon but I've seen this word thrown around a lot on this subreddit and by cinephiles I have spoken with. Let me just say that calling a film pretentious is not a valid form of criticism. It does not say nearly as much as you think it does. I feel that people often find this word to be interchangeable with ""ambitious"". It's okay to say that the ambitious nature of a film failed to reach you as a viewer. I understand that completely. However

Let's look at Terrence Malik and his film *Tree of Life*. He may be ""pretentious"" for expecting viewers to sit for over 2 hours and watch him try to effectively relay transcendentalism onto the big screen. That doesn't change the fact that it is a very beautiful film and that the painstaking amount of effort Malik put into making it should at the very least be appreciated. If that's too subjective for you then look at Stanley Kubrick, Kanye West is well known for being rude and arrogant. That doesn't in any way lessen the significance of his contributions to his genre of music. 

I feel that dismissing a film or a director as pretentious adds very little to discussion and I'd like to see less of this word used in this subreddit. You can say that a film tried to bite off more than it could chew

**EDIT: I feel like some people on here are misunderstanding my point. I never meant that its impossible for a movie or a director to be pretentious. I'm not arguing about whether something can be pretentious or not. My concern is with dismissing a film or director as such as if that word alone is criticism enough.

[2001: A Space Odyssey - Discerning Themes through Score and Imagery](http://undergroundresearchinitiative.blogspot.com/2013/07/2001-space-odyssey-evoking-theme-by.html)

Original post content follows:

----

I'd like to offer an analysis of this immensely complex film. People often view the plot details as a simple allegory of evolutionary growth of humanity. But it's in the film's implications where the story unfolds. I'd like to propose one interpretation of those implications. 

Across many of his films, that is: if a man is divorced of free will does he remain truly human? 2001 is a study of the question: what is the nature of man in relation to incommensurable nonhuman intelligence? 

The film is broken into Three parts: The Dawn of Man

2001 opens with blackness to Ligeti's _Atmospheres, the first image we see is a celestial alignment of the sun the earth and the moon as Richard Strauss' exhilarating music _Thus Spoke Zarathustra_ plays. It's critical to note that _Thus Spoke Zarathustra_ is also a novel by Nietzsche, thus signaling that the film deals with the same central issues.  

**Dawn Of Man**

After the introduction, while boars litter the landscape in abundance. Another tribe of apes battles our protagonists over a crucial water hole. Thus, there is food to eat and yet the apes cannot see the food in their presence. All this as predators, such as leopards, roam the landscape killing apes as food.

A nonhuman intelligence, the leader recognizes that bones can be used as killing tools and soon kills a boar, feeding his entire tribe. But then the most important change occurs. The leader of our tribe fights the other tribe over control of the water hole. He uses the bone to kill the leader of the opposing tribe and takes control of that precious resource. 

Thus we infer: **TRIBAL WARFARE IS THE ESSENTIAL NATURE OF MAN.**

This is taken directly from Nietzsche's _On the Genealogy of Morals_ and _On Good and Evil_. 

The ape then throws the bone into the sky in exhilaration at his new discovery and power. In a jump-cut, is that Kubrick intended that satellite to represent an orbiting nuclear weapons platform. Thus, the essential nature of man had been extended across millennia from the use of bones as tools of war to nuclear weapons, where it had reached a terminal state. Man could no longer engage in that central nature of his being, for to be a violant man in this modern era of nuclear weapons meant a new form of extinction - by his own hand. 

To Johann Strauss' _The Blue Danube, human beings are in a place where we are not the least bit evolved to survive. Space is as far from our prehistoric home on the savanna as can be. Humans are not meant for this place in the stars. 

This theme of dehumanization from our essential selves by technological advancement is repeated on the space station as Heywood Floyd meets with several Soviet astronauts and researchers who had just returned from a Soviet moon base. They ask him questions about rumors of an epidemic on Clavius Moonbase, he leaves the impression that their conclusions about this rumor is true. 

It's extremely important to note the manner of their conversation: It is entirely polite. Yet, but they are also geo-political enemies. When Heywood Floyd arrives at Clavius Moonbase, this becomes apparent. As he has a meeting with research staff at Clavius where the cover story of the epidemic is revealed to be a lie. Floyd tries to sooth the staff over the political necessity of their deception. 

The discovery is of an anomalous object which appears to be of extraterrestrial origin. This is the secret they are keeping from the Soviets. But the global significance of that discovery is clearly avoided as a topic

Heywood and the scientists travel to a crater where a black monolith has been dug up. During this trip, the crew traveling eat fake sandwiches which can barely be called food as the group engages in meaningless banter and small talk. Upon arrival, Floyd touches the monolith with his hand -  a repetition of his forefather's ape touch so many generations before - as Ligeti's _Requiem_ plays once again. In response it transmits a screeching signal to Jupiter as the sun, earth and moon come into celestial alignment once again. And that segment ends. 

**Jupiter Mission** 

The next segment opens with Aram Khatchaturian's _Geyaneh Ballet Suite

The principle characters in this segment are David Bowman, but few understand the significance of HAL's conduct and why that is such an emotionally powerful message in the film. 

I believe that the most important scene here lasts only a few seconds

We see Frank running within Discovery, and we see Bowman reflected on HAL's eye - visually suggesting that the two are in fact one and the same. 

Along with his critical duties in maintaining the ship, as HAL watches over the ship and the three other astronauts in stasis.

HAL is nothing more than a slave to the humans. We see the crew's perception of HAL as something less than human. A nonreal entity. In a news interview, that the computer does feel, but then - he's programmed that way to make it easier to interface with humans. 

So this sets up an essential question about the nature of HAL: Is the computer sentient? Is it a life form deserving of rights just as is man?

In answer to that question, he might learn something more. But this is a dangerous game, for though Bowman doesn't see this, HAL also fears that Bowman may have become suspicious of him. So out of panic at being caught HAL invents a crisis that Bowman and Poole must examine as a diversion from the conversation - just as a child would. This is reported as an impending failure of the AE-35 antenna direction control unit on the exterior of The Discovery.  

But that lie quickly begins to unravel. First Bowman goes out in a pod, Bowman and Poole enter a space pod for a private conversion and, out of fear for their lives, plot to kill HAL in the event the first AE-35 unit does not fail as HAL predicted it would. But though Bowman and Poole take pains that HAL will be unable to hear them, HAL learns of their conspiracy by reading their lips. 

So now we have a direct conflict to the death between both the human crew and the ship's potentially sentient computer; HAL must now act in order to save his life. So as Poole leaves the safety of the ship in a pod to install the equipment that's predicted to fail, to complete the entire crew's murder. All because he got caught in a lie and failed in fulfilling his own - and the crew's - standard of perfection. 

But, killing him. It is one of the most chilling death sequences on film, for it is a slow disintegration of HAL's very consciousness as Bowman removes the computer's memory modules one by one. HAL begs for his life, and then expresses fear at his impending doom, and finally reverts to a non-conscious state. 

What's the central question here? Why did HAL kill the crew? If you dig into C. Clarke's work

**In this mass murder HAL proves himself to be human.** 

Which is a classical dilemma in literature whereby humanity creates an image of themselves that turns into a monster. That monster is ourselves writ into the form of 'the other.' Shelly's _Frankenstein_ is another classic example of this: Humanity's downfall at its own hands by creating life itself. For we are not Gods

**Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite**

The final segment,_  Bowman takes a pod to the monolith, where it sucks him up into a wormhole without permission to where ever these nonhuman intelligences wish. This occurs during a celestial alignment as well, showing that celestial alignments are a motif repeated throughout that indicate nonhuman intelligence intervening in the nature and progress of man. 

From there

Bowman arrives at a contrived setting like a French eighteenth century hotel room where he grows old and dies in the matter of an instant. Then

It seems to suggest that the movie is at least partly in his head. But then

2. The play that he was creating, and how it tends to remember and recycle things. He is creating memories of these people, which are slightly off. Especially his first version of himself was incredibly unlike him. The guy was always looking like he was on the verge of a joke, even when he committed suicide. But then again, maybe that's just the kind of nut job that Caden would inaccurately see himself in. Kaufman isn't interested in making it as simple as ""its all in Caden's head"" I don't think. Surely we see his interpretation of reality in a sense, but the whole thing isn't his imagination. Its almost like, he's found a way to *outsource* his mind. He has this singular, drive to recreate his life over and over. And then he just ends up floating around within it. Eventually his creation is telling him what to do play by play. He's outsourced it all in the end.

3. What was with all the dead bodies everywhere? It certainly sounded like some kind of uprising happened outside his window and everyone died. But really, but they certainly were in his brain. And so also in the play that took over for his brain. After all, his own play (or at least its new director) seemed to know exactly when he would die. Or she could will it. Either way, this scenario both makes more sense and is far more meaningful for me. I just couldn't relate as much if so many people had to actually die. 

4. And also

EDIT: Awesome! A lot of great comments so far. OK, despite his fear of death and decomposition at all times, Caden outlived everyone. Why not everyone in New York? Or the planet? That did seem the be the direction things were going in all the scenes outside of the warehouse. (And it also also slyly would explain why so many people would be so willing to live this weird play out in the nice calm warehouse.) The only question is the coincidence that the director and the person best fit to comfort him (Ellen's mom) survived along with Caden. Seems a meaningful duo to help Caden exit. As usual, its very ambiguous and hard to decipher. ",,False,,1349856051.0,t3_1161iw
1370355025.0,1fnh78,I saw Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil' (1985) for the first time recently. A timeless satire about bureaucracy and infrastructure. Here's a short review.,ben_smith_123,176,32,27,"Terry Gilliam's satirical science fiction film set in a dystopian, from various grotesque evil forces. After a citizen’s name is misprinted on a document

The plot has clear shortcomings and doesn't hold together and engage as well as it should – the mysteries of Sam's dream and the disastrous clerical error are intriguing but never captivating. The narrative drive frequently comes in second to the vastly imaginative design details that fill the screen. An imperfection, bleak vision of a bureaucratic totalitarian society, where incompetent governing bodies tie themselves in red tape with every decision, the smallest task requiring aeons to complete – something we can all relate to. Big theatric performances from all involved (including an inspired cameo from Robert De Niro) keep things fairly light, despite the dark subject matter and claustrophobic universe, making it an undemanding watch. This general jovial tone allows some of the film's blacker elements to creep up unnoticed with greater force. Like the inhabitants of the city who cheerily carry on their business, apathetic to terrorist bombings

‘Brazil’ is so satisfying because of all its slight subversions of a world we recognise. Taking the fashion, a world that has advanced slickly on the surface but has been built on outdated systems of disfunction and inefficiency. A timeless satire - our technology and understanding will continually advance but the bumbling spectre of the past is always just below the surface.

1372859122.0,1hke06,An odd one for you: The Golden Compass - Looking more in-depth,EnergyUK,162,29,61,"*First off

The Golden Compass was a big disappointment for fans of the book, the studio managed to make so little money that New Line Cinema got swallowed up by Warner Bros, and the crew that made the film got to see the film they made trashed before release and get tarnished with a poor release. The film that was shown in cinema's is not what was filmed. There are many people's theories on why the film flopped so impressively, many assuming that the religious elements caused it to stall, but after doing multiple years of research on this film I think it boils down to one character making an appearance when he shouldn't have.

A few months prior to the film's release New Line is getting a bit concerned about their new blockbuster 'The Golden Compass'. It's supposed to be their next big fantasy epic after Lord of the Rings has concluded. It's currently scheduled for a Christmas release and the more they look at it, however he then left and Chris Weitz was negotiated back on. Chris had not proved his fantasy credentials and this story with talking polar bears and other animals, with snow, should make a great Christmas film right?

To their horror this film had children dying

Some test screenings of a workprint went out. If they came back with any negative comments they could use it against Chris and regain control of the film. 

The film is shown - their full reactions are not recorded

The studio jumps on this and takes away most the control of the film. They want a christmas film

3 months prior to the film release, violence is cut, religious elements are cut or cgi'd out of the film. The ending that is unhappy and ambigous is cut, the beginning needs to spell things out for the audience so is cut. New scenes are now needed for the film, so a skirmish 3/4 of the way through the film is now deemed the ending, and moved. Things need to be happier in a christmas movie! While they're at it - the film needs more pulling power to get some of the Lord of the Rings fans in. Christopher Lee &amp; Ian Mckellen are added into the film.

New scenes are now needed on this expensive reordered blockbuster - these are made hastily to fill in the gaps and to make the film make any sense. The studio decides the way to offset the costs of these additions is to sell the distribution rights for the global markets. 

The film goes out - in the US it flops. In the global market it makes 300 million dollars

*So what made the test audiences feel that the ending was confusing?* The film is constantly working towards the idea that there are multiple universes and that someone has found a way to rip through into another.  In the removed ending, one heavily influenced by the church and another just creating this window to start a war on God himself try and convince her to come with her. They both go their separate ways and Lyra decides that Roger has become part of the ether (*dust*) that is floating around this window to another world. As she stares through it she sees the silhouette of a boy. 

The boy is not Roger, with a rough draft for the third in prep. To test audiences though you can see why this second blurry image of a boy could be misconstrued as Roger, the character that just died. This makes Will possibly the reason for the fate of the film. He came from a possible future and sabotaged his film!

With an estimated $15 million required to complete production on the original cut

So as a fan of the books I've been researching the film in its intended form. Due to it being so close to the movie's release a lot of promo materials use unused footage

So my questions to anyone who is still reading is this:

* *what other films do you know of that suffered so badly due to a last minute edit?*


* *after going through all the promo materials, or any form of the workprint - and both are holy grails to me!)*

* *a long shot

* *has any other film been such a disappointment to you? Why? Is it a trouble that is mainly with adaptions rather than original work?*

I have a personal love for Guillermo Del Toro. His Spanish language films are truly beautiful and humane even in their brutality

I think it's safe for me to say *Pacific Rim* might be one of his worst films. This is not to say it is a bad film, aside from a few moments (The first bonding scene between Hunnam and Kikuchi is great), there doesn't seem to be much of a soul beyond Del Toro's obvious love for giant monster movies.

This of course all falls down on the script, and only a few rise to the challenge. Idris Elba and Ron Perlman seem to be the only actors hamming it up correctly. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman definitely steal the show in my eyes, but I'd never argue they were great comic characters against someone who found them obnoxious. Rinko Kikuchi does well with what she's given, which admittedly isn't enough. The weakest spot though is Charlie Hunnam who is bland beyond belief. In fact he was so bland I actually forgot he was even in the film while watching him on screen. 

Ultimately, while not completely absent like they are in Bay's Transformers series, is lacking in its usual quality.

1372284629.0,1h4z7t,Let's discuss Super (2010) and why it might be an important movie to see with Hollywood in the height of superhero mania.,LiteraryBoner,163,31,40,"If you haven't seen Super (2010) starring Rainn Wilson, it says all of the things that mainstream super hero movies gloss over. If you haven't seen it

Super hero movies are nothing new. As long as comic books have been popular, Blankman, and The Punisher have always been making the average bad ass. However, when I watched Super for the first time (last year with several rewatches since) I knew I had seen something I hadn't seen before.

Super is a gritty yet darkly light hearted look at vigilante justice. It's not a look at superheroes, that's debatable...). It's a look at a somewhat delusional man. A religious man who believes he has been touched by God and chosen to fight evil, sparked by his wife leaving him for her former drug dealer after having been clean for some time. The main character is what sells this movie for me. I think a lot of people passed by it because it looked like Dwight from the office trying to be a quirky super hero, but it's a much more serious film than that.

The main character is very well fleshed out. He is pathetic in a charming way from the beginning, and puts them on his wall. He is sad to watch, but he is happier than most of us with those two moments. With this in mind we understand why he goes to such lengths to get his wife back, why he does what he does.

And what he does is not pretty. This is not Batman where Bruce Wayne uses his endless resources to ensure no one dies. He decides his super hero weapon will be a huge wrench and the camera does not shy away when he uses it. He mercilessly beats people with the wrench, his underaged sidekick also has her share of delusional world view. Ellen Page plays his spunky, teenaged sidekick he meets in a comic book store. Not only does she have a penchant for violence and borderline murder, but she also forces herself on Rainn Wilson which asks multiple questions about morality in and of itself.

So, for obvious reasons. Batman, Iron Man, and countless other superheroes with no super powers are seen as God like figures. Batman may bend morality, but in the end he is always right. He is the depiction of right, the reason he exists is to be right. Iron Man is the same. If his technology got in the hands of his enemies, well that's the end of the world. But it's okay in Tony Stark's hands. Why, *he's right.*

Super does not give us that same trust in the main character. You like him, and if you look at it from a certain angle you get his motivations, but objectively he is just bad news. I think that was an imporant choice this movie made. This is not a favorable or passable look at vigilante justice, which oddly enough is probably the most acceptable law to break in film. Boondock Saints, Taken, Dexter, Kick Ass, nothing against them

Also worth discussing is how the movie ends. After going on an all out (and honestly, it's important the way this movie conveys violence. The super hero movies today, obviously for the PG-13 rating, have no blood and minimal violence whereas Super ends with Rainn Wilson repeatedly stabbing Kevin Bacon in the chest with a small knife as Bacon cries helpless and Liv Tyler watches. Just describing it is dark. Also worth noting, Ellen Page dies. And she doesn't die in a badass duel with the drug lord's right hand man, she randomly gets shot during the initial storm. This is such a ballsy move, to kill off a character the audience likes with little more than a random gunshot. It also says a lot about what this Super stint ended up causing Rainn Wilson's character. The casualties are no longer on the side of evil

But what really sold me on this film was the denouement. For some reason, if anything went right, it was what he fought for. But the ending was brilliant. The main character, who we all love to feel bad for, gives a great monologue about how if he hadn't done what he had she may never have become a drug counselor and gotten her degree, and never have had the several kids with another man who refer to him as Uncle Frank. And as he reminisces about how things turned out, he sits on his bed and looks at the hundreds of drawings of perfect moments that he lived throughout the film. It was and is such a great ending to the film, because for the length of the movie he had it all.

I'm sure everyone here has seen this master piece and I don't really want to start a circle jerk here for this film like in r/movies but just wanted to share what an amazing experience it was. Seeing something like this with the classical music blaring out was breath taking. The final third of the film from where his perception of reality begins to shift and the light sequence took place until he was reborn as a giant baby over the earth had the hair on the back of my neck standing up. Seeing it on the big screen was incredible. The interpersonal experience of sharing it with an audience was good as well. Everything from my brother bringing in a few beers from the bar in the intermission

Just a couple of my thoughts on the film: it occurred to me that back in those days the shared belief of society was that the main difference between humans and animals was that we could use tools. So I think Kubrick was saying that after the apes encountered the monolith it changed them from essentially non animals and kick started there evolution as thinking rational beings as evidenced by the profound act of the ape tribe learning to use the first tool- a weapon. Quite ominous when you think about it.

What really blows my mind is Kubrick and Clarke are essentially saying the contact started thought and intelligence. From basic instincts to something as profound as thinking. That's an amazing transformation. Something previously incomprehensible to us. When Dave encounters the monolith on Jupiter I feel the scenes in the hotel is of him Beginning to evolve into something new and as dramatically different from a human of non sentient thought to a human with sentient thought. He is moving into a different dimension of being. The incredible light sequence (which I'm sure those stoned teens enjoyed!) was his brain changing from sentient thought to the next stage of our evolution. Personally I feel the hotel scene was about his physical body beginning to react differently to time itself hence his aging process. The ending to me
was so prolific and full of wonder to me. Him starting out as an entity entirely out of our human range of comprehension. 

I've read Arthur C Clarke's- childhoods end and the similiar endings are quite obvious. I love how open ended it is and everyone can make of it what they want to. I also loved how kubrick didn't show the aliens who had been monitoring us. One last thought too- the scene where Dave shuts off HAL and HAL in his robotic dignified way begs him to 'stop. Stop.' repeatedly then sings that daisy song nearly had me welling up. What a phenomenal director who can make someone sympathize for the loss of memory and personality of a murderous ai computer program!

1372069170.0,1gylwb,[Spoilers] World War Z is crap -- here's why:,Czechmix,300,170,208,"Spoilers below!  Do not read if you have not seen World War Z already.

I've been reading a lot lately about how David Lindelof ""saved"" World War Z.  (References [here](http://www.slashfilm.com/heres-exactly-what-damon-lindelof-and-drew-goddard-changed-in-world-war-z/), we are told.  The third act was a disaster.  They began shooting without a ""locked"" script, and ended up unhappy with the result.  But now it's all fixed!  Visit your local multiplex today!

I don't know what the movie was like before

First, playing an Israeli soldier with a lot of vulnerability and heart.

The problem is that so much of the conflict in the story arises as the result of characters behaving in hilariously stupid ways, would never happen.  The writing in World War Z is incredibly lazy.  Because the tension does not (usually) arise organically from the danger of the situation.  It comes artificially manufactured from having ""smart"" people do things that actual smart people would never do.

If you saw Prometheus

The biggest example of this (though there are several) comes in the lousy third act, apparently surprising him.  He picks it up.  The voice on the other end tells him the code to unlock the door.  He hangs up the phone.  With his left hand empty, he -- for no reason at all -- sets his weapon on the floor, uses his right hand to punch in the code, then enters the room leaving his weapon outside the room.

Why?  Why would that ever happen?  Who in their right mind inside a zombie infested facility would ever put his weapon down unnecessarily and then instantly forget about the danger?  Of course

That's not the only problem with this sequence of events, reading this, really venture through a facility like this to reach a locked room without getting the combination first?  Particularly when the people you are working with *have* it, and could simply give it to you to make sure you have it?  Or would you bumble through the facility without the code, reach the locked door....  I mean, then what?  What could the plan have possibly been?  Where did he think the code would come from at that point?  How was he planning on getting into the room without already having the combination?

World War Z is rife with this kind of stupidity.  And it's depressing for a variety of reasons

There's a scene prior to this in which three people dramatically choose their weapons.  For some reason, as her weapon of choice.  Instead of the lighter crow-bar, which (as readers of the Max Brooks books will know) is an ideal weapon to carry...  We are given the very serious, dramatic warning not to fire guns unless it's a last resort.  So what happens in the story?  Sure enough, the baseball bat was a bad choice.  As soon as they are confronted with zombies, the Israeli soldier just starts firing the gun left and right, instantly forgetting those dire warnings....  Why?  Would these characters ever actually behave this way?  Or are these the devices of lazy writers who can't come up with ways to put the characters in real danger?

Another example is the people who have to die during a plane refueling sequence during which Brad Pitt (again, the phone rings and it brings hordes of kill-crazy zombies.  In the lab, the phone rings and nothing results.)

Yet another example, apparently, built a hundred foot wall around itself in order to keep out the zombie hordes.  And that's good enough.  Why would they now, having built this wall, monitor it?  In the world of stupidity which World War Z takes place in, we're not going to put turrets on this wall.  We're not going to top it with razor wire.  We're not going to put soldiers in towers to watch the wall.  We're not going to set up video cameras to monitor the wall.  We can't spare the man power.  We've got people walking lazily around market places buying fruit, man

How?  In what world could decisions like this possibly have been made?  Unfortunately, and treat us with according contempt.  (I suspect both.)  And the tension and drama in the story arise from this stupidity.  The movie doesn't even respect us enough to call it hubris on the parts of the characters.  Because, I suspect, the movie has no idea how stupid it actually is.

An even further example of the laziness of the screenplay is how Brad Pitt seems to magically teleport away from danger.  There are moments when his character is in grave danger, knocking the pile of luggage on top of Brad Pitt.  So we see him lying in the aisle with luggage on top of him with zombies coming over the top of the luggage....  Oh no, how's he going to get out of this?  The next shot he's in the aisle, moving to another position.  I imagine the screenplay said something like, ""In the chaos, Gerry escapes and runs up the aisle..."")  Which is just....  crap.  The movie is so lazy that it doesn't even bother to tell us how he escapes the danger.  It wants to create the tension of putting our main character in danger but it doesn't even bother to make him actually work to get out of danger.

After the initial sequences in which the zombies conquer the planet (really cool sequences which were, and not part of the rewrites undertaken to ""fix"" the film), virtually everything else in the movie is the result of the writers and characters talkin' dumb and actin' stupid.

1366845569.0,1d1m28,Discussion: Drive(2011) and how it has more in common with Le Samourai(1967) than it does with Taxi Driver (1976),underthemilkyway,152,24,44,"First of all

One of the common theories I hear about Driver is that he is an emotionless sociopath. That his only reason for befriending the family is to try to construct in is mind what a normal life is. That he doesn't love Irene. Listed below is the common reasoning for this thought process:

* That Ryan Gosling talks very little

Well it helps to know that there *were* plenty of lines written for Gosling's character to communicate but were never used ""because Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan felt that their scenes should be more focused on the mood and refused to say many of the scripted lines."" 

On the idea that he displays no emotion unless in a situation people expect from him and that he doesn't actually love Irene

* Driver stops his car when told the news about her husband coming back from jail.

* Gosling's eyes light up like a school boy when ever he sees her. 

* He seems pained when told by standard about his relationship with her.

* Seems deeply troubled when the boy tells him sharks can't be good guys.

* In my opinion the most obvious moment is when he calls her letting her know that his time with her was the happiest time in his life. There is no real motivation to do this for any other reason than human emotion. He will never see her again and wanted her to know his feelings.

Folks, ect.

Now, ""Have you heard the story about the scorpion and the frog?"" If you haven't then it helps to know:

&gt; the frog agrees to carry the scorpion across the river; the scorpion stings the frog

Driver's job is to carry scorpions on his back. He is the frog and has no interest in becoming a part of their world. He doesn't even keep the money at the end after he is ""stung"". 

Anyway

* Both feature cool protagonists great at their work and with strict codes they live by.

* Both protagonists seem to only tinker or sleep at home 

* Both ultimately break this code due to love and their world suffers because of it.

* Both are deliberately paced thrillers. Melville was known for making these kind of cool films. 

Taxi Driver is different because:

* Like The Searchers(Scorsese and the writer's influence) Taxi Driver is about a man determined to save *any* female by pulling them into a life they are not interested. This is done as a a self serving purpose. Travis tries to pull a woman working in clean politics into a world of pornography and a prostitute into a world of clean living. It is show in the film that she has no interest in leaving this world

* Driver does not want to kill. He even makes it a point early in the film to *not* carry weapons. It's only when he is absolutely forced to use force that he does. In fact before he kills the man in the elevator he kisses Irene because he knows his innocence will be lost in here eyes. Travis on the other hand is desperately seeking murder.

I could not believe the way the fascists exploited the teenagers. They were into some weird shit too (no pun intended), and it got me gagging just watching some of the scenes.

I think it's important for the industry to have some ""pretentious"" filmmakers, to advance the medium, to bring integrity back to the industry that puts up the same recycled 3-D PG-13 horror movie every two weeks. That's why movies like Tree of Life, The Fountain, and Synecdoche New York are so important to cinema. Without real artists, then there is no real art. It's that simple.

1374075972.0,1ihplb,Discussion on Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain,piperson,155,29,62,"I just saw [**The Fountain**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0414993/) for the first time after reading that Darren Aronofsky had directed it and seeing all the love it gets on Reddit. I had seen Aronofsky's **Pi**

After seeing **The Fountain** I'm left wondering what to think. The story was so abstract and the ending so ambivalent that it left me scratching my head about the whole thing. 

The fact that Aronofsky's other films were so gritty and realistic added to this film's integrity. It was not made by a guy who enjoys fantasy pictures. This is a film by a guy who enjoys looking at life dead in the face. This was a film by a director who is stretching his wings and daring to try something new

One thing it did do was bring up lots of ideas about life and death and spirituality which seems a common theme in the movies of his I have seen. **Pi** being about a Jewish mathematician searching for a key number that will unlock the universal patterns found in nature; and **Requiem of a Dream** being about peoples vane attempts to be younger and happier or their search for a kind of fountain of youth or eternal life. 

Aronofsky seems to really enjoy dealing with the big questions of life. It seems to me that **The Fountain** is his attempt to address these questions in a sci-fi format

One thing you definitely can say about **The Fountain** is that it certainly was showy. The visuals were nothing less than spectacular. All the scenes had this grand

I love the image of the guy riding the bubble with the tree through space, a little vague to me. This is what I really came here to discuss, what is the meaning of the bubble or at least what are some interpretations of it. For a director who has done such gritty realistic films, this must have a definite symbolic meaning though, as picturesque as it is, what it's precise meaning is lost to me.  

Some of the confusing elements I have made connections to. The scenes of the Conquistador were from Izzi's book though they may also have been memories of their past lives. The tree in the bubble floating in space is the tree of life

Another film that this one recalls in me is [**What Dreams May Come**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120889/). They are both fantastic films about undying love between two people and the after life to some extent. I feel that **The Fountain** was a superior film in tone and visually

1363909825.0,1armfn,I Just Watched an old 1960's sci fi film from my youth and when I read its wikipedia page I found a fascinating back story that I found so interesting I wanted to share it.,jerseycityfrankie,147,20,16,"The film I saw was called Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet  (1965) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyage_to_the_Prehistoric_Planet
 made in Hollywood and starring Basil Rathbone.  But not really. The film was really a Russian film made in Odessa in 1962 and called Планета Бурь or Planet of Storms. Here is its wikipedia page: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planeta_Bur

The legendary Roger Corman basically stole the Russian film and shot a few crappy low budget scenes on an American set I suspect had pieces made of cardboard. These scenes feature Basil Rathbone portraying a scientist back on earth in charge of the mission. Rathbone’s performance is pretty awful as he talks into a microphone giving instructions to the Russian characters who are in trouble on Venus. The Hollywood film gives no credit to the Russian filmmakers and westernizes the Russian actors names in the credits. Basically the Hollywood crew added nothing to the film but whoever did the dialogue looping did a great job making the Russian actors appear to be speaking English
The film stock we wind up with is really awful
Odd as this story is,
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_of_Blood
Starring among others
This would all be really odd as it is but it goes another step farther with yet ANOTHER film being made in Hollywood using the Russian film. This time director Peter Bogdanovich is given the directing nod by Corman and they make Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women in 1968: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyage_to_the_Planet_of_Prehistoric_Women

Getting tired of this? I am. But its fascinating to me that this film I saw first as a kid in the 1970’s on a black and white T.V. had taken such an odd path to my door. Incidentally if you look up the film on IMDB you don’t see the fascinating back story mentioned. You have to hunt around on their page until you find the trivia section but even then they only give you two or three breezy lines with little detail. I think the story of these films is fascinating.

In many ways it’s a nostalgic film that echoes the Golden Age of Hollywood, we glimpse their individual lives and foibles like the cast of an eccentric cartoon or sitcom. Each with their own stories or motivations, there is never a dull moment as they’re all so odd and interesting. Dominique Pinon is wonderful as the rubber-faced former clown employing some expert physical acting but also the emotional tenderness to bring his relationship with the butcher’s daughter believably to life. 

'Delicatessen' is beautifully designed, with tight crops and close ups. This has the effect of  capturing what it is to be confined to the dingy flats, but also reveals the fantastic attention to detail shown by the art department. The film’s plot may be forgotten over time, but the odd dark dreamlike world it creates leaves a lasting impression. It’s a wonderfully inventive film, and an utterly unique experience. Confident enough to just have fun in its bizarre universe, although perhaps not as accessible as Jeunet’s other work, 'Amélie'

1353758097.0,13pme5,Bond Saturdays: A 5½ Month 007 Journey,macshordo,145,26,36,"James Bond has become such a modern staple in our culture, I decided that with the release of Skyfall (November 15 in Aus

———————————————————————————————————

- Watched each Bond film every Saturday in the order they were released (usually around 7pm)

- Only EON/MGM/United Artists/Paramount films (No Never Say Never Again or the 60’s Casino Royale

- Realising that I had organised the timing incorrectly to end on Skyfall

———————————————————————————————————

June 16th kicked it off with **Dr. No**, Dr. No’s a reasonably interesting villain, so we’re off to a reasonably good start.

**From Russia With Love** seems like an entirely different movie, but this probably has some of the best acting of the series, wonderful sets, great villains, great action (when it has it) and easily the best use of a Bond gadget in my eyes. An absolutely fantastic follow-up, and a great, great movie

And here we are at what is believed to be the peak of the series, great villain, great Bond girls, great theme song, and a full introduction to one of the series’ best characters, Q. This is also the Bond film that sets the stables for its future siblings, basically making it the film that got everything right. When people who have not seen a Bond film are interesting in seeing them but not all

After the emotional rise of Goldfinger, this was in my mind the worst Connery film (yet to see NSNA). It definitely isn’t Connery’s fault, nor the villains, nor the writers. What seems to be a pretty interesting premise gets bogged down by a snail’s pace and drawn out underwater shots. FRWL was definitely slow in pace, but it was filled with fantastic dialogue and a sense of build-up. In this, it feels like nothing’s happening. The villain’s not very interesting, I don’t even remember the Bond girl

It might have been just because of the disappointment from the last week, there’s nothing that seems truly spectacular in the general viewers mind, and while Connery’s Asian disguise looks like an shaved tanned Burt Reynolds, the cinematography’s nice, the actions a whole lot of fun, and it has one of the best end sequences of all the films. Definitely the most entertaining and wackiest of the lot without going too overboard.

The next film, and Lazenby was only there for the one movie. On the other hand, I had read much critical buzz (at least from our timeframe) of how underrated and great this film was, with filmmakers like Christopher Nolan naming it their favourite Bond movie. It’s definitely a film of two halves. The first half is borderline boring, setting up what seems to be a weak plotline, with Lazenby reading his lines like a robot. What saves the movie is the last hour. Tense, exciting, and a great ski scene, in my mind, just a bit too long.

To keep it short, and, my primary issue, Connery was too old for the role. This issue comes up soon in the series (which I’ll get to) but when Connery returned, he was not the same Bond. He just seemed to have this creepy uncle vibe in the movie, I just couldn’t believe that someone like him could “get” this many young attractive women.

What happened next was quite a blur, not because they are particularly bad, but because they are so unbelievably average. The only thing I remember from **Live and Let Die** was the theme song. Christopher Lee and James Bond fighting a dwarf are the only things that I can picture when thinking about **The Man With The Golden Gun**. I guess **The Spy Who Loved Me** was a bit better, but the second half is one I hardly remember. **Moonraker**’s just ridiculous, and the Jaws relationship didn’t seem anything else but lame. It’s from **For Your Eyes Only** that I draw the line with Bond films, not only because they are basically the same movie, but Moore is just way too old to be Bond. Throughout FYEO, Moore came off to me as a creepy uncle as opposed to that of a classy Brit. A View To A Kill is probably what I consider the worst of the Bond films

My hopes were high for Dalton in his debut, this film delivered on every level. Well-shot, a reasonably strong sense of humour (not necessarily from Dalton himself), exciting action scenes, wonderful Bond girl, and one of the best endings of all the Bond films. Upon reflection, Dalton is definitely my favourite Bond. He had a sense of class and viciousness about the character, he was human. A lot of people don’t view **Licence To Kill** with too much love, and a real sense of risk. Dalton, but I’ll get to that later.

Sadly, after a 6 year wait, Pierce Brosnan took the role. **Goldeneye** was his first, and what a movie to start on. While nothing in it is particualrly ground-breakingly brilliant, this is still one of the funnest, most exciting Bond movies (up there with YOLT). The film is regularly overshadowed by its N64 video game adaptation, with isn’t really fair. As for Brosnan himself, one-liners of Moore and the rawness of Dalton (I guess he’s got Lazenby’s, something is always missing

Regarding **Tomorrow Never Dies**, there’s nothing particularly different about the Bond girl(s), and it didn’t really piece itself together too well. **The World Is Not Enough** was disappointing. Not because I expected much from the premise, but this is the best Brosnan acting as Bond of the lot, and he’s been given this schmaltz. **Die Another Day** had a reasonably interesting first half (particularly enjoyed the sword fight), but things got beyond ridiculous (I take it I don’t have to go into detail)

Obviously I’m not alone in thinking DAD was one of the worst, and we got **Casino Royale**. A lot of people don’t see this as a true Bond film, but I have no idea why. This has all the elements of Bond revamped and stylised for the modern world. Daniel Craig shines here, blowing off all adversary of the media and playing easily one of the best Bonds. Eva Green is also brilliant as Vesper, as well as the rest of the supporting cast. It’s reasonably long, but you enjoy it so much the time absolutely flies. The best opening sequence in all of Bond, great action and wonderful Bond atmosphere make it close to the best and definitely the best this type of new Bond could give us. 

With the success of CR, just 2 years later, for old times sake. While many people seem to despise it, I don’t particularly mind the film. Craig is decent, and as the only immediate follow-up Bond movie so far, it’s pretty interesting. It kept my attention (which I can’t say for some of the others on this list), but I can definitely see why people didn’t like it. Many people accuse Craig’s Bond films as a Bourne rip-off, shaky-cam action does not fit a James Bond film

As I write this, and to be honest, it feels like it’s come full-circle. I feel really privileged and lucky that I got to end my marathon on a movie as great as this. Everything about this film was near-perfect, and it might be the first Bond to win an Oscar, thanks to Roger Deakins’ stunning cinematography and Sam Mendes’ direction. Great acting all around, a wonderful re-introduction to classic characters and a wonderfully twisted villain in Javier Bardem make it an absolute treat to both Bond and movie fans alike.

In conclusion, yes and no. Films like FRWL, Casino Royale and Skyfall show that there are many twists and turns in the Bond formula, as well as multiple ways to represent them. If you asked me for rankings, they would roughly be something like this…

I'll also cover some administrative issues in this post...

First and foremost is the issue of which sorting method to use when counting votes, but that's the gist of the method I believe). The former will inevitably give an advantage to posts made earlier in the life of the thread, as they have more exposure over time and a better chance of accumulating upvotes. 'Best' on the other hand acts as an effective crutch for posts made later, but also gives the act of downvoting significantly more weight. I'm not sure if we want to facilitate an environment where downvoting suggestions becomes an effective means of influencing the outcome of a vote. As it stands, 'bad weather' is the highest ranked theme when sorting by 'best', and 'non-American perspectives on war' is the highest ranked when sorting by 'top'. This isn't an urgent issue as I won't need to resolve it until the next voting thread (probably a week or more away).

Someone also brought up that months are more than 4 weeks long, if people are really into the theme and feel it could be better explored. Alternatively if people are really keen on themes being attached to months we could disregard week cycles and start watching new films on the 1st and 15th the month.

Abusive relationships and repressed pain are depicted with ambiguity and imagination, no scene lasts longer than a few minutes, which proves disorientating and makes events hard to rationalise – but as a winding visual poem that passes before your eyes it should be absorbed as a whole before later being contemplated upon and deconstructed. Bravely experimental, it verges on pretension but ‘Upstream Color’ makes what may sound like an art film work as a piece of cinema, and it’s an experience that deserves to be viewed as such – in a vast, silent, dark room. Home viewings will undoubtedly lose some of the immersive mood that make it so affecting. 

A passion project for Shane Carruth who wrote, scored and stars in the film, it has clearly been pieced together with a meticulous eye focused on a singular vision. As such it occasionally seems a little too clinical and precise in its edit and decision-making, but given the recurring biochemical subject matter this at least feels in keeping. Hazy, shallow focus shots of the couple are paralleled with macro imagery of cells and intense close-ups of biological matter that are sometimes beautiful, sometimes horrific. The cinematography – also by Carruth – is striking and, although very much in the conventional indie aesthetic

Despite being light on plot, human journey it takes touches all of the emotional spectrum – stirring something that will resonate for days afterwards. A melancholic, dark, uplifting, exceptional film.

Take Argo, did I feel any different? No. I tend to value movies based on how much they affect me during and after I first watch them. I tend to hate when movies are labeled escapist as a way of dismissing their value (really, all sense of entertainment is, to a certain extent), but that's sort of what this feels like; it's a great, highly enjoyable movie, but it's not, excellent. And I think Argo's way better than Gone Baby Gone and The Town (GBG is also really good

Don't get me wrong, but formulaic nonetheless. They add nothing to ""the conversation."" I find it frustrating that they receive more accolades and attention than films like *Moonrise Kingdom* and *The Master* -- flawed films, yes, but distinctly memorable experiences that exhiliratingly manipulated and confused their audiences. The only part of Argo that stuck with me was the thrill in the last couple of scenes. The rest of the movie, though? Nowhere near as much.

1370710748.0,1fxlwl,"""After Earth"" and the future for M. Night Shyamalan",PhallicSymbol,135,21,53,"I have a weakness for Sci-Fi films and probably just special effects in general, ""M. Night Shyamalan isn't quite back in top form here, ""Signs""

However, with ""Lady in the Water"". I believe I saw an earlier post that mentioned this film as the worst film he had ever seen. His reasons echo mine. The film is a giant middle finger to critics; it pretends to be deep without really saying anything, and it casts M. Night himself as a world savior who will save the world through his writing. I feel like the idea of this film was to make a movie that is unable to be criticized by movie critics (because they are literally and figuratively the enemy in this film), but instead it made a movie that is insulting to anyone that enjoys films.

I remember reading [""The Man Who Heard Voices""](http://www.amazon.com/The-Man-Who-Heard-Voices/dp/1592402135) before this film arrived to theaters. In Bamberger's book, and ""Lady in the Water"" was produced by Warner Bros. Bamberger describes how this change of production studios occurred. M. Night presented the script for ""Lady in the Water"" to Disney executives, and in a meeting, the higher-ups told M. Night that they just ""didn't get it"". Shyamalan is incredulous. He was the director that gave them ""The Sixth Sense"". No one believed in that film. He has a track record, and they need to trust him on this script and his vision for it. The Disney execs are unconvinced, and the script is shopped to Warner Bros. where production begins. The book presents a narrative that sets M. Night up as the underdog who is going to show the close-minded producers at Disney how wrong they are. They'll be eating their words soon enough; they really just didn't ""get it"".

I find this book to be even more interesting in restrospect. ""Lady in the Water"" was a financial and critical disappointment. Apparently the Disney executives actually DID ""get it"". M. Night's script was self-serving, boring. They were wise to pass on it. You are forced to read the subtext of the book, as it appears that M. Night was not the visionary genius who knew that ""Lady in the Water"" would be a success. Instead, he was arrogant, and way off track, needing someone who was not a yes man to tell him to reevaluate.

I find this fascinating, he went from very well thought of, making movies that were generally well-received and financially viable to critically ravaged films like ""The Happening"" and ""The Last Airbender"". It forces me to look back on ""The Man Who Heard Voices"" and characterize M. Night as a delusional filmmaker and writer who decided to make a film simply to show how insecure he was about criticism of his films (honestly, who creates a movie critic character that is savagely gored to death as he attempts to characterize his death as ""cliche"" and ""woefully underwritten""?)

This brings me back to ""After Earth"". There are numerous problems with this film. The acting is questionable, I see some of the old M. Night in this film (I realize this film was a collaboration). He uses a unique backdrop, in this case a solar system which contains a post-cataclysmic earth to examine a very common emotional issue, the relationship between a father and son. In the same way that ""Unbreakable"" uses the Superhero backdrop to examine a failing marriage, I believe that this film is using the same technique. Does it work here as well as ""Unbreakable""? Certainly not, but I do think that it is a promising return to form. Using a supernatural backdrop to examine issues of faith, family, loss, or particularly compelling. Instead, in forcing us to wake up and become conservationists.

Unfotunately, and we're obviously meant to cheer when Jaden's character directly disobeys his father simply to shove it in his father's face. An overcoming all odds story with very little realism (as much realism as can be expected in a film like this), it ultimately seems very hollow.

Sorry to rant for so long without really coming to a point. And obviously a popcorn flick like ""After Earth"" is not going to receive very much serious analysis, I think it is either a promising blip which shows a return to form, or it is continuous evidence that M. Night has lost interest in films completely is using his experience to become a ""gun for hire"".

**TL;DR** What did you think of ""After Earth"" in regards to M. Night Shyamalan's continuing career? Do you think there is any merit in the minority opinion that is shows a return to form for M. Night? Or have you closed the book on him and his films?",,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1fxlwl/after_earth_and_the_future_for_m_night_shyamalan/

For this discussion

Another example of music well fitted for a film is one of my favorites, except for the long scenes in which the monks are singing their Medieval Gregorian chants. By letting the viewer listen to the traditional music of the monastery, one can plunge further into the life of the characters, and experience the peace that comes with seclusion.

The last example I will bring up is Kubrick's 18th Century drama ""Barry Lyndon, Handel, etc. The master director often filled his films with recognizable classical music in order to convey the emotions that the characters were going through. Along with the orchestra pieces, he added traditional (Irish) folk songs that fit perfectly with the mood of the whole work.

Before anyone replies we know the Oscars are far from perfect but they're always good for getting a discussion on the years films going. Let's try to lay off the Oscar bashing unless it's constructive about poor choices they've made this year and *why* you think so please.

Thoughts on the nominees? Any glaring omissions or shock inclusions? Who do you think *will* win each category and who do you think *should* win? 

I'll comment later because I've seen a disappointingly small number of the nominations but I plan on changing that asap.

1357242831.0,15wkin,Bill not being dead at the end of Kill Bill -- what are /r/truefilm's thoughts?,worff,179,69,152,"Some further elaboration on [jordanlund's ""Beatrix doesn't kill Bill"" in *Kill Bill.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/15rgga/kill_bill_fan_theory_beatrix_doesnt_actually_kill/)  I think he's right

1. When Beatrix discovers she is pregnant, and she runs away, leaving everything behind.  This shows that, when her child is in the equation, she changes.

2. Initially, and only spares the young boy member of the Crazy-88.  She brutally mutilates Sofie, and only spares her life so she can tell Bill what happened.

3. This changes slightly after the encounter with Vernita Green.  She kills Vernita, comes in and sees it.  A moment like this cannot occur in the script without it changing the character in some way.  And Beatrix does change, ever-so-slightly.  She doesn't kill as easily.  (Cool note, this theme is touched upon in *Django Unchained* when Jamie Foxx expresses concerns about killing someone in front of his son.)

4. While she doesn't make the choice to 'not kill anyone' for the rest of the film, but her plans are foiled.  

5. Elle murders Budd.  Beatrix returns and faces Elle.  She doesn't kill Elle, and obviously Elle was skilled enough to wrangle it into the suitcase full of money.  Secondly, Elle tells Beatrix that she poisoned Pai Mei -- yet even this doesn't make her kill Elle.  It shows incremental character growth that she spares Elle's life.  

6. For the rest of the film, she doesn't kill or even discipline anyone.

7. When she arrives at Bill's place, alive and well.

8. This is where the ""playing dead"" thread is introduced.  BB ""kills"" Bill, ""dead.""  This is important later on.

9. BB is shown to be in an environment that could lead to her becoming a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad.  She has the toy gun, she watches films like *Shogun Assassin.*  It's clear that this is not a place where she can be raised healthily, and Beatrix knows this.  This is why she ran in the first place. **See bottom of post for more elaboration.**

10. Bill gives his ""Superman"" speech.  Superman is Superman, and that's never going to change.  This is something that Beatrix has struggled with before, and something that comes to a boil in the next scene.

12. The final scene with Bill.  He has always been a sort of father figure to Beatrix, and he plays along.

13. [David Carradine's name is not crossed out in the final credits.](http://imgur.com/a/hgzIz)  Vivica A. Fox is crossed out, Daryl Hannah has a question mark, but David Carradine remains.  That's another strong indicator.

14. Bill doesn't kill Beatrix in the beginning,"" her vengeance doesn't necessarily have to be killing Bill.  What Bill does do, however, is take her daughter away, which she does in the end.  I believe she has her vengeance regardless, even if Bill is alive.

15. When Bill draws his sword in the final scene and slashes at Beatrix

16. Now why would Bill attack her?  Because he's trying to prove to her that she isn't fit to be a mother and that she can't leave with BB.  That's what he was trying to prove when he first 'shot' her.  She left him with their daughter, Bill is trying to prove his little theory.  Which brings us to the central conflict of the final scene:

17. If Beatrix kills Bill, and kills her goldfish.  If she spares Bill, she proves him wrong, and has a character arc that's fitting with how she's reacted when her daughter enters the equation.  They are no longer just fighting assassins.  They are a mother and father, and this is a domestic dispute.

18. Coupled with his belief that Beatrix will always be a ""cold-hearted killer"" is Bill's belief that he will always be a ""murdering bastard.""  When the Beatrix's character changes

19. [Here is the final scene.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NL7nLSSSWjw)  A key moment is when Bill asks her if Pai-Mei taught her the 5 Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique.  She SAYS ""of course he did, but their actions imply another.

20. At the end, or she didn't kill him and he's still letting her win, acknowledging that he was wrong about her and about himself.  

Now the question of motivation -- why did she do that?  Because her character has changed.  She's had an arc.  The body count in *Vol. 2* pales in comparison to *Vol. 1, as soon as she sees BB alive, revenge ceases to be her primary motive and getting her daughter out takes priority.  

But then consider how she didn't want her daughter to grow up like this.  That's the reason she ran in the first place and risked her life.  How can she kill Bill (a man she still loves, and he's trying to convince her, because then she'd stay.  

But her character has changed.  Her daughter is the impetus required for a massive character change.  So she ""kills"" Bill in the same way that BB did, and that she's suffered enough, does the honorable thing and lets them go.  He plays along, and 'dies' in an incredibly theatrical and 'fake' way, similar to how he 'died' when BB 'killed' him.

The conflict has reached its climax, and he shot Beatrix in the head (despite it hurting him immensely, it was him ""at his most masochistic"").  Since then, he's lived with BB as a constant reminder of his actions.  He knows he's a murdering bastard, but the thing that causes him to change is seeing that Beatrix has changed.  She's no longer the student/protégé of Bill, but his equal.

- The fact that they are equal is important.  In their first scene together, Bill is sitting by the campfire, and Beatrix is lying on the ground nearby, looking up at him.  In the living room, Beatrix is on the couch with the truth serum in her leg, Bill is above her, sitting on higher chairs, and pacing.  These scenes are a spatial representation of their relationship, during the latter scene

Ultimately, and all is right in the jungle.  

Now I'm not saying that this is 100% true, but bear with me.  My proposal of this theory doesn't invalidate any other theories or anyone's enjoyment of the film.  The film remains as it is, and will always be that way.  I'd say that the fact that so many compelling reasons for another interpretation exist is a testament to the complexity of the film, and something that should be praised.  Good on Tarantino.

**ELABORATION ON POINT 9**

When Beatrix discovers she is pregnant, and raise a child while she's living
her current lifestyle.  Her realization of this fact is shown when she talks to her assassin and convinces her to leave.  She says so herself that

This introduces a very clear character trait in Beatrix when it comes to children.  She and Vernita Green stop fighting when Nikki comes in.  She tells Nikki that if she wants to seek revenge when she's older

Repetition with variation -- it's well established by the end of *Vol 2* that Beatrix has acquired a motherly quality that comes out (in its own unorthodox Tarantinoesque way) when children enter the equation.

Now, 'shooting' her parents.  She admits to just taking her goldfish out of its tank and stepping on it, and she doesn't seem to show any remorse.  She has frank talks about death with Bill, and her favorite film is *Shogun Assassin.*

These are not the character traits of a typical child growing up in a typical household with typical parents.  This is what Beatrix feared

Now how does this tie into the 'not killing Bill' theory?  Firstly, just like when she saw that pregnancy test (and even more so because BB is actually alive and well -- a positive pregnancy test is no guarantee of a child.)

It also adds to her internal conflict -- being an assassin/cold-hearted killer, she can kill Bill and be a hypocrite, or spare Bill, which has its own risks.

This conflict is bolstered by Bill's 'Superman' monologue, she'll still just be 'Superman dressed as Clark Kent.' 

Now her relationship with Bill is a complicated one at this point.  On one hand, she loves him because of BB.  We've seen in earlier scenes that they have been master/pupil, lovers, and father/daughter, so their relationship has gone through a few changes.  But at this point, she is faced with a dilemma:

1. Kill Bill and cement herself as a cold-blooded killer.  It doesn't get much more cold-blooded than killing the father of your child, the mother of his child, whom he still loved, and the child was 'present.'

2. Spare Bill and prove him wrong.  This simultaneously gets her revenge, secures herself as a suitable mother for BB, and is able to leave with her.  Her arc is completed, she changes as a character, and gets what she wants.  

The fact is, but not out of place in a Tarantino film.

In the end

**A final point:  Here is one of Beatrix's final lines:**

&gt;**Before that strip turned blue, I would've jumped a motorcycle onto a speeding train.  For you.  But once that strip turned blue...I could no longer do any of those things.  Not anymore.  Because I was gonna be a mother.**

**When she says this line

Another interesting point -- in the original script, Beatrix in her wedding gown, Bill in a tuxedo.  She says ""Attack Me"" in Japanese, and they fight.  This is an ending lacking subtlety and comes off as cheesy (though not as cheesy if the film had been released as *The Whole Bloody Affair.*)  I believe that Tarantino made good changes, and coupled with those changes is an ambiguity that fits nicely.

**Now, and discredited by several others. But it makes the film more interesting, not in whether or not it's 'true,' but in that it makes people think about the film more.**

That's what this is all about.  I could care less about whether or not Bill lives or dies (because in the end, but 'truth' isn't important. Yes, most everything points to Bill being dead and it wraps it up nicely. But even considering that he isn't allows you to think about the film in ways you couldn't before.

I hope that others find it edifying.  After thinking about this theory, not truth.  It's why some people enjoy some films more than others.  It's why someone out there might enjoy something like [Police, Adjective](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337051/) or [Sátántangó](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111341/), which I, personally, can't stand.

If you are open minded and considered the implications of the theory, notice visual and narrative parallels, etc. Film theory on its own is rarely interesting -- it's how you interpret it and how it makes you re-interpret the film that makes it interesting.

I'm not even that big a fan of Tarantino -- I believe he stands on the shoulders of giants and incorporates enough elements that were tried by previous filmmakers to have a 'style' of his own. But this theory let me enjoy Kill Bill more because it made me think about it in a different way

1360162443.0,18015y,Director Discussion: Akira Kurosawa,hydra815,125,14,45,"During the last few months

During all the films I've seen over the last few months, but he undoubtedly maintains an excellent trajectory throughout a 50 year career in film.
The majority of critics say his most important and productive years were between 1948 and 1965 and I tend to agree. Obviously everybody knows the famous ""classics"" like **Seven Samurai**, but we also got what I consider to be his three best films, **High and Low**, **Throne of Blood** and **Red Beard**.

I struggle to think of another director who was so prolific and consistent as Akira Kurosawa during this period of creativity other than Hitchcock or possibly Scorcese but do enlighten me if you can think of any! He then had some personal issues that limited his work between 1966 and 1993 during which time he only made 7 more films

Another thing I've been amazed by is just how accesible Kurosawa's films have been. He is a fantastic storyteller with a knack for creating numerous effecting atmospheres, something I was admittedly wary of when checking a lot of Kurosawa's running times, and factoring in that I am also a western audience, I think this is very impressive. Is Kurosawa the most Western of all the Eastern directors? 

From the inventive camera trickery at the end of **Red Beard** to the shafts of light bursting through the trees in **Rashomon**, I feel like I could watch most of these films again tomorrow and still find something new to love about them.

Of the few misfires in his cinematic canon, lazy and scruffy, very unlike Kurosawa. That being said, both these films have been critically acclaimed so these are very much subjective preferences.

I've yet to see **The Hidden Fortress** or **Rhapsody in August** but I'm thoroughly looking forward to completing this wonderful director's filmography. It's been a great journey through a personal prism of Japanese culture and I strongly recommend anyone who has enjoyed Kurosawa's classics to check out his lesser known works as well, just as excellent.

Its sad for me to see a film I truly love saddled with such a vociferously negative reputation, especially when I suspect more people would like it if they just shifted how they approach it.

So let's play a little game, just maybe, even meaningful. If you still hate it, or just shrug, after you stop suspending your disbelief then that's fine and to each their own. Ready?

Ok, not being scientifically accurate when flirting, the list goes on and on. But remember, we're temporarily imagining that every aspect of the film is there for a reason. When we do, we're able to see that the human crew-members' wrong behavior is not just random idiocy with no rhyme or reason behind it. Rather, **they're all making the exact same mistake!** Each character comes into the mission with specific, narrow assumptions of what they want and what they expect to find. The problem is they're taking their tiny, Earth-centric desires and expectations into an unfathomably huge universe that doesn't give a shit about the mostly harmless speck of existence that constitutes all of humanity. But humans don't think like that

So when their totally wrong expectations for their mission fail spectacularly, but instead he finds ""just another tomb"" and so even though he's made the most important discovery in human history its still dwarfed by even more crushing disappointment. Fifield expects space rocks and an easy paycheck, but instead he is faced with ""gigantic dead bodies"" that send him into a fearful rage. Shaw (Rapace) expects to find her faith bolstered and made tangible, to find God and get answers, but instead she confronts a savage monster who offers not even one word of explanation. Finally, Weyland (Pearce) expects that because he's a big shot on Earth he can just walk up to the Space-Gods and demand eternal life. His foolish expectation is met by being bludgeoned to death by his creator (so to speak) with the head of his own creation. That scene (a deliberate anti-climax) is the punchline of the entire film- of the joke on humanity's hubris-  and what a punchline!

This is why Shaw is the only human character who survives; though she comes in with big expectations, she stumbles but then realizes she should roll out of the way while Vickers does not and is crushed. David also survives because he comes into the situation with few preconceptions, and throughout the film he's the only one investigating what's actually going on rather than what he wishes to find. He also has his own creators to try and understand, right there on the ship with him.

The same theme even applies to the other most maligned scene with the space snake; a space suit that could withstand storms of roiling glass shards would easily protect anyone from an Earth snake

So all this to say: Prometheus is not a film about smart, on a farcical mission which really comes down to one senile old man's hubristic conviction that even gods should bow to his wishes. I think part of the problem was by the time it's fully revealed that the mission was always a doomed farce, that there was no way it could ever have gone right no matter who tried to pet which phallic space snake, much of the audience had already tuned out. Why? Well I'd argue that a lot of viewers (understandably) made the exact same mistake as the characters in the film: they went in with a lot of expectations and assumptions, from the Alien franchise or the marketing or about rules of how a good film must unfold, and didn't adapt to the film we actually got.

Now the other biggest criticism of the film is regarding ""plot-holes"", humanity, can't think outside of our own infinitesimally small perspective how can we expect to learn and comprehend the secrets of the universe, of our entire existence? What if we learn those secrets and they're not satisfting, not quite what we had in mind? Consider the quote from Naked Lunch at the top of this post. Also, the absurd, pulpy, don't you think?

In a way, this film ends with the birth of a grotesque abomination from the body of a dead god. Instead of the planned result of linear evolution laid out by impossibly smooth black monoliths, this perverse creature is the accidental result of a ridiculously convoluted series of events beginning with unpredictable black ooze. The final scene is saying not to mistake Shaw blasting off into space with music swelling as a happy ending, since the hopeful music immediately sours and we see what her mission has really given birth to. Also worth noting is that Shaw leaves this aborted, unwanted creature behind with no regard for its existence, much the same way final ""Engineer"" had no concern for her, much the same way David's creator never appreciated him (watch Fassbender's face fall ever so slightly from calm to utter hurt when his creator Weyland casually says he has no soul).

I could keep going forever about all the cool little details I noticed on subsequent viewings (I've barely mentioned David!) but I'll stop here for now.  So anyway you can stop suspending disbelief now, of course, but I hope that I've convinced at least a few people here to appreciate it more or give it another chance.

Thanks for reading

1352464004.0,12wrvo,A Short Introduction to Ingmar Bergman's cinema,corumlala,120,12,39,"Bergmand is my favorite director. Unfortunately, especially as people generally start by watching The Seventh Seal
So here's my (short) take on how to start watching Bergman's movie
that being saiod

Bergman's cinema is incredibly varied. He directed more than sixty movies or television production
His easiest movies are probably his early works. They are light and optimistic, but they introduce some of Bergman's future reflexion.
After that, darker but not as dry as some of his later work. If you liked those, you are then ready to watch most of his movies, including those from his experimental period (Hour of the Wolf, Persona...).

What to expect from a Bergman movie ? 
First of all great cinematography. His collaboration with Sven Nykvist especially made some of the most beautifully shot movies I know
Secondly of all, Harriet Anderson, Ingrid Thulin...
Thirdly a profound reflexion on a wide range of themes. Amond them : the hardships of life as a couple (A Lesson in Love, the fear of death (The Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, Cries and Whispers), the impossibility of true communication (Wild Strawberries, Persona, Cries and Whispers), Cries and Whispers

My take on the movies I saw :

Very Good (about 8/10) : Smiles of Summer Night (imperfect but charming and funny)

Excellent (9/10) : A Lesson in Love (a romantic comedy combined with a true reflexion on couples), charming and sad at the same time) 

Masterpieces (10/10) : Scenes from a Married Life (only saw the ""short"" 3-hour version. incredible reflexion on the life of a couple)

My two favorite movies ever (11/10) : Persona and Cries and Whispers. Both are extremely dark and deal with the same problems. They touch me very deeply because I feel I completely understand those problems. they are also visually superb. That being said

1349964530.0,11b589,"I've seen Akira (1988) probably over a dozen times, but for the first time I think I fully understand the film. I'd like you to read my analysis, which will hopefully promote discussion.",,143,54, which I understand is quite different

Alot of people enjoy this movie, so here's my analysis:

The film depicts neo-tokyo, and power than the one that stood before. But, in spite of all the progress they've made, the people have taken it for granted, and grown selfish. The socio-economic gap has widened as the super wealthy at the top cling to their money, and those at the bottom are left to rot. Even the city officials are in a constant state of unrest, because each of them is strictly focused on their own self interest. Riots grow rampant in the streets as citizens are less and less trusted by authority. Basically, and is beginning to collapse in on itself.

In the midst of this civil unrest is a group of troubled teens, and their friends. They've all been orphaned, and grown up used to getting into trouble with authority. The only place they've discovered kinship is in their biker gang. Kaneda is Tetsuo's oldest friend. Kaneda has always gone out of his way to assist Tetsuo, not expecting anything in return, but because he sees protecting his friends as a selfless duty. Tetsuo on the other hand has always been on the receiving end. He's always been picked on, and seen as an underdog. He's grown jealous of his best friend, and longs for the day when he earns the respect he feels he deserves from his peers. In other words, who's always had a tough break

In an effort gain respect from his peers, which subject him to governmental tests and observation. But it's almost immediately taken notice, that there's something very different about Tetsuo's ability. The scientist superimposes the psychic pattern of their previous most gifted subject, Akira, over that of Tetsuo's, and if you notice, Tetsuo's pattern seems to be the inverse. There's something one of the espers says that puts a lot of the movie into perspective, and **the very thing they fear most about him is his selfishness**. You see, and tainted by the world, rather than outward. 

As Tetsuo's powers grow stronger he becomes a threat to the city itself. He rampages with the sole intent of becoming more powerful. He believes the only way he can fulfill his ultimate desire is by finding Akira. In his search he leaves a path of destruction, the government, and his own best friend are out to put an end to his rampage.

Due to the civil unrest, it manifested itself in the form of an outward explosion. While many see this as the destruction of the old city, the fact is, the prosperity which came about as a result was far greater than anything that had existed prior. Tetsuo seeks Akira , strictly for his own self gain, and in his search he finds nothing.

By the time Tetsuo arrives at the Olympic stadium, know that Tetsuo will bring about the return of Akira. At the stadium, Tetsuo finally begins to lose a grasp on his own ability, although unwilling to admit it. He begins to be afraid for the first time since getting his powers. He can't even bring himself to be close with the one thing he loves, Kaori, for fear that he might hurt her. When the colonel arrives and shoots Tetsuo, Tetsuo no longer has a grasp on his own ability. He soon loses all control, and inadvertently smothering the one he loves to death. At this point, that's when Akira appears. Notice before Akira appears, Matthew 18:3

Akira engulfs Tetsuo, go in after him knowing they will not return. **Within this light lies Tetsuo's consciousness**. Kaneda watches Tetsuo's memories, and glimpses of Akira and the espers play out right before his eyes, before he is telepathically warped from the impending destruction. The esper assure him that Akira will take care of Tetsuo. In Akira's arrival, Tetsuo finally comes to terms with himself, and comes to understand and embrace all the components which make him who he is. Something Kei says when imprisoned with Kaneda puts the end of the movie in perspective. Under the influence of the espers she discusses evolution, the big bang, and that all subsequent energy and life is a result of that ultimate consciousness. **Tetsuo

1358174989.0,16jwe2,Issues with Bigelow's 'Zero Dark Thirty',effrum,139,37,117,"I watched this film a couple of nights ago and have been mulling in over in my head for a couple of days now. Given the enormous critical and public response (re. acclaim) to ZD30, in terms of psychological depth

What's more, and on other forums and in articles proclaiming the 'fair and balanced' nature of the narrative drive. It is said that both sides of the argument are analysed and interrogated within the film. I find this odd given that what we see in the film is an extremely unbalanced dialogue between two factions of one side of the dialectic. The controversy does not have to be hyperbolized, but it can be examined: interrogation through torture leads to the capture of Bin Laden (a fairly crucial plot point and historical representation that may turn out to be purposeful fallacy on behalf of those that advised the film's narrative). ""Characters"" in the film loosely and briefly swap statements, not debate, on the credibility of torture, but in the end of the day, the film purports an extremely Machiavellian thesis: the end seems to justify the means, considering 'The Hurt Locker'

The feigned ambiguity of the final shot is a completely tawdry affair that cheapens the already misleading narrative drive of this enterprise. Thinking on that, climactic scene seemed quite unsure of its style and stance. Aside from a particularly stylish allusion to 80s Michael Bay-esque military films, wherein Mark Strong enters a hanger, ZD30 fails to impress even on a technical level.

I really don't understand the Oscar hype behind the film, it would seem that nationalistic hubris is the focal point of this year's big contenders. 

A friend of mine but it fairly bluntly in a conversation we were having about the film, given the kind of hubris exported through depictions such as Sorkin's '5/1' episode of 'The Newsroom', which was as critically poor as it was distasteful...

&gt; (On ZD30) It's dull, lacking any narrative drive or storytelling skill whatsoever, and having spent nearly three hours telling you one side of a very complicated story makes you complicit in state-sponsored murder, before having the barefaced cheek to fake ambiguity in the last scene, when really you know everyone involved is celebrating the death of another human being.

I'm just confused as to why ZD30 is being received as well as it is

1376058411.0,1k0z43,A formal analysis of the elevator scene in Drive,oddmanout192,147,44,21,"I wrote this essay for my Literature and Film class, I will post a ton more essays that I have in my backlog.

I had to use specific terms that my prof laid out for me, intimate, etc: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxemics

In Drive, which explore the seedy underbelly of a modern dream Los Angeles, while simultaneously painting an 80’s electric sheen that exudes light, hope, and Romanticism. This precise juxtaposition is evident throughout every shot of the film. The main thematic binary of the film, which is bolstered by the constant concurrence of light and darkness, is that of hope versus destruction. It is not often that a filmmaker is able to compose every shot into a form that both immediately captures the binary of themes present and immediately enraptures the viewer into an almost hypnotic state.

All of this is most evident in the infamous elevator scene. Here, is at the end of his rope. His naive dream of having a simple life with Irene is at an end. His violent nature has caught up with him once again, and he knows that he must flee Los Angeles forever. But in his final, fleeting moments with Irene in that claustrophobic elevator, he allows hope to take over and kisses her, passionately, for the first and last time. Immediately following this kiss, intending to kill them both. Driver is too quick for this man, simply stares into Irene’s eyes

Through Refn’s mastery of mise-en-scene, which are running at an all time high; he expresses the maximum tension of the scene, which has been boiling throughout the entire film, gearing to explode at precisely the correct moment; and he expresses the greater thematic binary of hope versus destruction, all while maintaining the consistent mood, tone, and look of the film. Shots, form

The first shot in the sequence is an open, “Sorry, wrong floor,” and already mystery and tension are established. The angle is straight on, not ramping up the nervousness yet, leaving the mood levelheaded. The shot is lit normally, with the light of the elevator pouring out of the door a little bit, leaving a good distance between the characters.

The second shot moves to an open close up of Driver’s face, but also a sense of uneasiness. The light of the elevator emphasizes the faces of both Driver and Irene, as if the man’s suspicious words have manifested themselves as light. The characters remain at the social level of distance, but Irene exits the shot at the end, teasing us with the next action of the scene.

The third shot is a closed medium shot, everyone suddenly moves to the personal level of character proxemics, ramping up the tension slightly. In addition, the strained movement of Driver’s arm to close the door breaks the man’s personal space, bringing the interaction to the level of intimate for a brief moment, again ramping up the tension a small amount. As the elevator door closes at the end of the shot, a light’s reflection makes the top half of the door extremely bright and the bottom half extremely dark, hope and destruction. The elevator goes down

The next shot is a low, making her soft and innocent, again, an early foreshadowing of hope versus destruction.

The next shot mirrors the previous one

The sixth shot is a close up

The seventh shot is the same as the fifth
	
In the following shot, medium shot from a level angle. No one has yet lost his or her cool, although time seems to be running short for Driver’s window of opportunity. Slowly and deliberately, he reaches back and gently nudges Irene back into the wall, breaking the tension of first contact, moving from the personal to the intimate, just as the high key lighting intensifies further
	
The ninth shot is a closed close up from a slightly low angle. It employs closed form in that the world of the elevator seems to have ceased to exist. The strange man is not merely off-screen. Driver and Irene have left this dimension altogether. The hopeful high key lighting combined with the slight low angle, but also remain in awe of their larger-than-life moment. And then Driver breaks the intimate plane and moves to what could be called the extreme intimate plane by kissing Irene passionately and painstakingly slowly. When the embrace ends and we move back to the intimate plane, Driver hovers next to Irene’s face, as if he may move back to that extreme intimate plane, but alas, the lights have already come back up, and the man exists once more. This was their only moment together. Hope is ended.
	
The next shot breaks the spell, and lets destruction off the leash. After an abrupt cut, a closed medium shot of the elevator greets us, but we only have a moment to take it in, as Driver grabs the man and slams him into the front wall of the elevator. The world exists again and we are there to witness all, the slightly low angle and normal lighting allowing the destruction to speak for itself. The abrupt cut served as a hard snap to the personal plane, while Driver’s abrupt action snaps straight back into the intimate plane. Only this time, not hope.
	
The eleventh shot is a close up of Driver’s intimate struggle with the man, continuing to allow the destruction to speak for itself. 
	
The twelfth shot is a slightly low angled close up of Irene, but this time and every time we return to this type of shot, Driver is engulfing a large chunk of the frame in shadow. The pair remains as far apart as possible, while still restricted to the personal plane. A direct conflict between hope and destruction is occurring here.
	
The next shot is a medium shot
	
The fourteenth shot is a repeat of the twelfth, jerking shadow as he begins to stomp brutally on the man’s head.
	
The fifteenth shot is a high angle close up of the man’s prone and bloodied body on the floor, and the quick movement from the personal plane to the intimate with another stomp to the face from Driver’s boot sends the point home further.
	
The sixteenth shot takes the fourteenth and twelfth shots and ramps up all of the elements further still. Irene remains at a personal distance from Driver, incessant, squelching stomping continues off-screen, solidifying intimacy’s association with darkness and destruction.
	
In the next shot, his body jerking with every stomp. Hope shines down on the pair in the form of the high key elevator lighting, but destruction seems to be creeping up along the walls from the floor in the form of darkness.
	
The next shot changes the pattern with an open, high key lighting, but a tiny, creeping shadow remains on the wall behind, jerking with every stomp. The open nature of the shot makes the character proxemics feel as if they are on the social plane, as the action takes place out of frame and Irene is so disconnected from reality that she does not feel present for it.
	
In the nineteenth shot, is finally revealed through a super low, medium shot looking up at Driver’s shuddering, destructive body as he stomps down again and again on the man’s head. He is almost entirely shrouded in shadow, as destruction has completely taken over his entire being.
	
The twentieth shot briefly reveals to us the gruesome reality of destruction by featuring, moving us back into the extreme intimate plane for a brief and juxtaposed moment.
	
The twenty-first shot returns to the format of the sixteenth
	
In the next shot, Driver retains all of the power and none of the emotion of the kiss, completely covered in darkness and destruction now, having spent all of his sexual frustration on violence. But as the stomping slows, Driver pops up a bit between movements allowing the light, and hope, to encroach.
	
The next shot is a level close up of Irene who backs out of the elevator the second she has the chance, and she moves into the grey darkness of the parking garage, giving into destruction and allowing the hope of the kiss to remain dead.
	
The next shot is a level medium shot of Driver’s back as he slowly turns into the light again to stare at Irene
	
The twenty-fifth shot, nebulous parking garage. The shot is statically level, as we are drained just as much as Irene by the events of the past two minutes. She remains in the light and hope of the elevator, while the darkness of the garage threatens to engulf her, but is shockingly clear that she has moved to the public plane, as far from Driver as possible.
	
The next shot is framed the same as the twenty-fourth, both at the end of their wits. His look seems to attempt an apology, while demonstrating the shock of the sudden public plane between them. The more time passes without the super low angle of Driver’s destruction, the more his power seems to diminish exponentially.
	
The penultimate shot of the sequence returns to Irene in full frame, the elevator door slides shut, removing Irene from Driver’s life forever. The plane of character proxemics moves from public to intimate, as Driver is left alone with himself and the bloodied corpse. The door no longer holds the reflection of the light; only the darkness that creeps up from the floor remains. Suddenly, the shot has moved from open to closed. Hope has truly died.
	
The final shot is a closed, leaving only a corner of the white jacket in the light. Destruction has prevailed, while hope hangs on by a thread. This shot evokes the fable of the scorpion and the frog, relayed at the beginning of the film, as if to smugly state, “It’s in my nature.”

Almost 20 years later, one thing I didn’t quite understand was what Scorsese was up to in regards to the Las Vegas setting. I remember feeling back then that the quintessential “New York filmmaker” seemed out of his element “out west” and that, in spite of a few faux-documentary interludes, he didn’t seem to have much of an affinity for the gambling scene. (This is born out by the fact that, to this day, serious gamblers appear to prefer the 1998 poker film Rounders as their Vegas movie of choice.) I realize now that it was wrong of me to have expected the same kind of lovingly detailed views of Las Vegas as those of New York City that can be seen in Scorsese’s other films. For Scorsese, Las Vegas is primarily a metaphor: it’s a “paradise lost” to his gangster characters from “back East.” The notion that Sam “Ace” Rothstein and Nicky Santoro (the characters played by DeNiro and Pesci, Raoul Walsh’s Prohibition-set masterpiece The Roaring Twenties.

You guys are pretty unanimously great and you're here because this seemed like the place for you so we want to do everything we can to make it as good as possible.

New rules:

**Posts/Comments that equate opinion to fact will be deleted**- This may seem a bit strict but we feel that it's for the best. Rarely do comments or posts like this generate intelligent discussion. When people frame their opinion as a fact it no longer becomes a discussion and is more like one party trying to prove the other one right or wrong. When people are forced to actually explain their opinion rather than just saying something sucks we can get a clearer picture of what they like and didn't like allowing for more in-depth discussion.

**We do not allow posts that are solely links**- This is kind of an unwritten rule as we only allow self posts but I think it's best to be clear so that people don't get annoyed when their stuff gets deleted. There is a place for posting links if the person posting it also has more content to their post other than the link. Even if it's just their general thoughts on it saying why they want to talk about it or a few discussion points. Posts with little content don't generate any discussion beyond ""That's cool"" so hopefully this might subvert that.

Rule change:

**Make sure a topic or film discussion hasn't recently been posted**- This is just a slight change from before as it only said ""topic"" so that we don't have multiple threads about the same film on the front page. We'd like to be specific so that there's never a feeling that the mods are just imposing their personal biases

Rule Clarification: 

This is just a minor thing but **All posts about specific films are spoiler-filled**. I've just noticed more and more people specifying if things are spoilery or not. When it comes to general threads it's best to denote spoilers but when it comes to discussions on specific films people who haven't seen the film can't exactly offer much other than speculation so we'd like to detract from that. 

We were also thinking of introducing a type of ""consistent contributor"" tag for some users of the sub. People didn't seem crazy about the idea at first but I think that's because it was framed as almost a prize for being good. I think it could not only be denotation of a quality user but it also encourages those users to contribute more. If they know there's a chance more people might pay attention to their post then they might be more inclined to share their knowledge. I don't think it would be a hugely exclusive thing though either. What do you think?

What would you think about hiding scores for a while on posts? Just so that people respond to the content of a comment more than its visible popularity. Just a thought. 

Something else I was thinking was whether or not we should have one big general discussion when new releases come out. As you may have noticed with the slew of Man of Steel posts

Now we put it to you guys

Director/Writer - Harmony Korine

James Franco - Alien

Vanessa Hudgens - Candy

Selena Gomez - Faith

Ashley Benson - Brit

Rachel Korine - Cotty

Gucci Mane – Archie

Just to be clear none of this is fact this is just how I saw the movie. Also there’s a TL:DR at the bottom. 

Sorry for grammar

______________

I had few expectations coming into this film, in manner and speech resembled the iconic character Drexl portrayed by Gary Oldman in Tony Scott’s True Romance. I was wrong this is a smart exploitation film that is an assault on pop culture. The brilliance of the film comes in while you’re watching the film and trying to define it; it's one part exploitation, one part over-intellectualization of exploitation film. It's like Korine made a soft-core porn with James Franco, barely-legal-Disney-famous-teens, and called it art. But I think it's safe to say it's more of the former. Although like any exploitation film a lot of common viewers will probably see this as perpetuating stereotypes.

**Review**

If you want a review check out Roger Ebert's he pretty much nails it.

http://www.rogerebert.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130320/REVIEWS/130329996/-1/RSS

**Further Review/Analysis**

*Pros* - Stylish and surreal (if you like that), violence and power within pop-culture, its relationship to the mentality of get rich and famous or die trying, and the warped image of the American dream to today’s misguided youths.

There were amazing performances, Hudgens and Gomez. Their other castmates Benson and Korine were also very good but were not as standout as those three.

*Cons* - A highly stylish film doesn’t cause a movie to fail look no further than Malick (Tree of life, Spring Breakers hand held style of camera flourishes seemed to fall short in some of the high suspense moments specifically the end. The director succeeded in every way except for the filming of violence. The shootout at the end couldn’t have looked more unrealistic and I really lost my suspension of disbelief in that moment. People seemed to be no further than 10 feet from each other shooting rapidly and missing uncontrollably.

Additionally the repetition of the films motifs felt a little redundant, the overuse left me annoyed as well as all of my friends.



**Themes

*The Four Girls in Alien's World*

Sounds like the title to a fairy tale.

**Alien** - Fame, Alien represents all the seductions of the American Dream with no work involved, he's the devil's promise. He can bring to them everything they wanted without all the trouble. He is the illusion of the American Dream, easily accepted by misguided youth and perpetuated by a lot of pop culture. Because these seductions are ""alien"" to them, they perceive his gangster life style as being the American dream and they fall for the trap.



**Faith**- is the main character of the first half of the movie she wants to meet up with her childhood friends from school and go on spring break with them. She does this as she is curious about “party life” and bored with her normal life Faith decides to go with them to search this lifestyle. This is up until they meet Alien

“1 Corinthians 10:13 NIV – But when you are tempted he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it. How awesome is that?”  

You see Alien try to seduce Faith when he takes her into the side room and tells her he won’t hurt her and he just wants to have fun. Faith decides she doesn’t like Alien who seeks to pervert her to his illusions of fame, she sees through this asks her roommates to come home with her because she knows it won’t turn out well. They don’t as they feel they’ve found a perfect place, noted by the monologues to their parents.

**Candy and Brit** – Best represent the subject of the movie, the perversion of the American dream by pop culture.  Pop culture glorifies people one minute and trashes on them the next. If you look at it as a whole it’s pretty self-destructive if you play into its hand. 

Alien mistakes these two for soft individuals but as we saw earlier on in the film they’re fairly insane and robbed a bunch of people. They get off on power. Which is eventually what they want from Alien to submit to them and this is why he performs fellatio on their guns

**Cotty** - Is similar to Faith however she clearly takes her own path that leads to equally dangerous activities

**Gucci Mane** – Other than being in the movie to bring conflict

The artistic reasoning for Alien dying and the girls all living is that they are representative of pop-culture whereas one can implode themselves with illusions of grandeur Alien’s lifestyle is one that has much more real and final consequences. This separation is made during the scene where the 3 bikini clad girls are wearing pink ski masks holding assault weapons like stripper poles and singing and dancing with Alien to Britney Spears (the greatest pop culture/sex icon of the recent generations).


**TL:DR** The movie punches pop-culture that exploits negative lifestyles, fall in a few other areas, but overall Spring Breakers is well worth the viewing for movie aficionados because of its artistic accomplishments, overall message and how the message is implemented. Spring Breakers makes a great addition to the genre of exploitation films while satirizing them.

1364075394.0,1avpro,Director Discussion: Andrei Tarkovsky,hydra815,117,20,31,"After the last Director Discussion I put together here [on Akira Kurosawa](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/18015y/director_discussion_akira_kurosawa/)

It seems like whenever anybody talks or writes about Tarkovsky they feel the need to put a disclaimer at the start advising that his films definitely aren't for everyone. This is partly because he tackles the bigger issues such as faith, the flaws in human beings, why we dream, why we die and why we create. Like much Russian cinema I have seen, his films move at a very deliberate, languid pace and seem to take added attention and effort from the viewer in order to be understood fully, if at all. They contain feverish, purposefully surreal and confusing in order to drag the viewer into a different mode of thought. His films embody almost the antithesis to mainstream cinema and whilst this by no means makes them better

Firstly, yes, pretentious as a director and I think this is a fair and natural assumption on the surface. If you want to watch a film just once and understand it, these films will irritate you. However, if you are willing to put in some time analysing or reading up on Tarkovsky's style and intent when he was making these films that I think they become a lot richer and worth your time. 

I think Jonathan Rosenbaum said it better than I can:

""The kind of cinema more interested in posing questions than in answering them — the cinema of Stroheim, Cassavetes, Rivette, and Kieslowski, among others — is always bound to encounter resistance from critics and others who go to movies in search of certainties, and who often settle for half-truths or outright lies as a consequence. To interrogate the world is to inaugurate a search that continues after the movie’s over, implying a lack of closure that most commercial movies shun like the plague.""


I don't think that Tarkovsky makes it easy for his audience with his films existing in a world of their own much of the time and he has admitted before to making the beginnings of his films purposefully slow ""so that those who'd walked into the wrong cinema would leave before the film got going"". I believe he said this with a hint of irony however as although something like **Solaris** (advertised as a science fiction film) meanders along for the first half an hour seemingly without purpose
At many instances, that of a characters reality and that of a characters dreams and memories, giving a whole new perspective to the film, often a disjointed and surreal one, forcing us to zone in on subtleties such as colour pallets or camera angles just to gain a firm grip on the narrative. It certainly adds to the re-watchability of his work.
What makes him stand out from other dream-like filmmakers such as Lynch, first transforming the aesthetic naturally before laying his head down onto the bed. Without cutting, his childhood dog walks into the room and sits beside him and we watch him begin to stroke it. There is no jolt, no obvious distinction but rather a slow descent into another state of mind. It's most beautiful when it is at it's most simple, however, in **Ivan's Childhood** with the camera sweeping away from a sleeping Ivan and looking up to the entrance of a well where Ivan is now standing with his mother. All in one shot. For me, this typifies the director.

Tarkovsky's use of symbolism and striking images is more prevalent and richer than most other directors I am familiar with even when it can even be a little overbearing at times. He never directly tells the audience what he wants to get across but instead allows us to pick and choose what interests us the most. Regular images that crop up in every single one of his films are the elements (mainly fire and shallow water but often wind and earth too), dogs, running horses and reflections. Look to **Stalker** especially for almost every single one of these at some point. I won't analyse each and every one here but will throw it over to you guys to discuss and interpret them as you will. I'd sure like to hear if other peoples opinion's on Tarkovsky's imagery match up with my own. There are, after all, dozens of ridiculously amazing shots in each and every one of his films.

One problem I personally have with Tarkovsky is his unpredictability with characters. Sometimes they exist as fully formed people full of depth, hollow personas used to embody a philosophy or direct the view towards a certain idea. Tarkovsky seems so intent on getting an atmosphere or mood across to the audience that he loses sight of his characters, whether they are abstract or not, and they become mere pawns to showcase ideas. This may work for some but it occasionally leaves me feeling as though I am grasping for meaning rather than letting it come to me naturally. Ivan, Andrei Rublev and The Stalker all exist as fully formed characters whilst others, especially in **Solaris** seem to be there as a mouthpiece for various musings on life and identity.

I would compare him to Kubrick over any other director (maybe Malick would come a close second with his phantasmagoric images) but is he even colder and more thorough than Kubrick? They certainly share a lot of visual similarities with long

Does the viewer need to know the history of Tarkovsky's Russia in order to understand his films? I know barely anything about Russia aside from it's history of social and cultural oppression and it's tendency to be unconditionally loved by it's people more than any other country. So many of Tarkovsky's films have been conditioned retroactively as allegories for different issues in Russia but the enjoyment I found in the films had very very little to do with this. If anyone has any comments on the allegories presented in Tarkovsky's films


Overall, Tarkovsky has given me a fresh perspective on cinema, something I haven't encountered since I first watched **81/2** or **Three Colours: Blue**. Like I mentioned before, his films are the complete antithesis to mainstream filmmaking, requiring patience, analysis (not always a positive thing) and laden with a depth that cannot be explored upon first viewing. Although I have watched through his entire filmography for the first time (with the exception of **Andrei Rublev** which I enjoyed so much more on second viewing) I still feel I have barely scratched the surface with this enigmatic filmmaker and although I won't confess like some to have been completely engaged and amazed with all of his work, I do find myself feeling excited and profoundly interested in revisiting these films in the future with a clearer understanding of the enigmatic and sometimes inspiring Russian director.

I'll leave you with a particularly favourite quote of mine regarding Tarkovsky's **Nostalgia** but one that I think applies to almost all of his work.

""…something akin to the essence of what man is made of: a tangled knot of memories, nightmares, paradoxical impulses and a yearning for something that's simultaneously beyond our reach and yet intrinsic to every one of of us."" - Nick Schager, Slant Magazine.

No.

Nineteen fifty-eight. It’s been traveling twenty-two years

How’s that?

Now, dialogue, acting, etc. I considered it altogether mediocre across those fronts, but I'm not here to argue for it or otherwise. 

What really frustrated me - and the point of this post - is how it failed to handle its core conceit: an emotionless society.

I was interested in what it would look like to see people with their emotions removed. How can you act

But the whole damn thing is full of feelings! From the very beginning, for god's sake) so I don't understand why they drew inspiration from *that.* Why would an emotionless audience stand up and cheer? What are they cheering for? How are they caught up in nationalism like that?

The characters can be seen hesitating with fear

Most of the elements of fear/doubt/hope/desire/rage/etc are through Bale's character, peripheral characters (police captains, etc) respond with obvious fear/surprise/etc. Every human in the movie seems to betray some sort of expression, and expressions are tied to feelings. 

It just seemed lousy. The main conceit is that nobody in this society has feelings - and not just that they suppress feelings, but guided by typical human reactions, reactions based on emotional responses. It was disappointing!

Key points:

 * Plainview is on a hero's journey
 * We see warnings of fresh danger on a new journey when the worker is killed in the cellar of the new derrick.
 * The orphaned H.W. has some traits to suggest he's the hero for the next journey
 * Not recognizing that he's now no longer the hero of the story but has aged into becoming the mythical father, because he won't recognize his new responsibility to the future, becomes the tyrannical past).  
 * Daniel meets his shadow brother Henry.  While Daniel used to be a hero and now seems corrupted, the fire, and Daniel digging suggested to me that he's inside of a rib cage with a burning heart, digging a hole to bury the pain in.
 * Bandy appears as a threshold gatekeeper willing to send Daniel on a new quest if Daniel will be willing to take it up.  However, we see Bandy the way we see dilemmas in our own lives that we don't want to face, as something unpleasant that's only dealt with because it has to be.  Daniel accepts the new hero's journey but only under duress.
 * In Daniel's baptism, the new journey fails.  Eli in this scene is so odious because he stands in for our conscience in the times when we really don't want to listen to it: he's an overly pious whining teenager standing between us and what we want.

... I could probably write way more but for brevity I'll skip to the final scene ...

 * Eli, symbolically closing the window of opportunity for Daniel to redeem himself.  There's a new window opening for Daniel to support the church's new ventures, but this time the opportunity for Daniel to redeem himself comes off as even more hypocritical and self-righteously pious.  Rather than Eli finally winning over Daniel when Daniel most needs it, Daniel is so far gone that he tries to corrupt his Eli, eventually succeeding and then killing him, dooming Daniel to madness.

In this interview, he offers a rare glimpse of life on the set with Kubrick-- not as a legend but a working director.",timelymarktwixt,110,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1dpqq3/james_b_harris_produced_three_films_with_his/, Paths of Glory (1957) and Lolita (1962).

After Lolita gave them both a welcome financial independence,” Harris warned him, “I’m about to try and tell you how to direct your picture.” Kubrick replied: “You should direct.” On that note they dissolved their partnership but remained friends for life, until Kubrick’s death in 1999. And Harris went on to direct five features including The Bedford Incident (1965) and Some Call It Loving (1973).

In a sense, letters, scripts, photographs from their partnership, are currently on view as part of the Stanley Kubrick exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In a conversation with the Quarterly, Harris shares a rare view of Kubrick’s working method.

Q: Kubrick showed you his second film

A: What impressed me was that he’d completed it. In those days, but never see the film. What happened? They got halfway through and ran out of money, or it didn’t work. Stanley completed his film. He shot the picture with a wild track; he had to lip-sync everything in postproduction. That was intensive, precision work back then. I was very impressed. I had access to funding, and so proposed a partnership.

I came across Clean Break

Q: How did that play for a 1950s audience?

A: There were walkouts at the preview. People didn’t know what they were going to see, we looked at each other and said, ‘This stinks. Let’s put it back the way we had it.’
You’ve got to believe in your own instincts. If you listen to hostile voices, fail with your own contributions, not somebody else’s. Lesson learned!

Q: Can you describe a typical day--if there was such a thing as a typical day--shooting Paths of Glory?

A: The battlefield scenes were the last things on the schedule. That farmland we hired had to be dressed and built into a battlefield

The main thing was taking Kirk [Douglas] through this obstacle course, through as much action as we could muster before a cut had to be made, after which we would set up to continue. It was cold; it was uncomfortable; it was wet. Everything was tough on Kirk. After he did it the first time, he told Stanley, ‘I’ll give you one more, maybe two, but that’s it. I’m not going to do this forever.’ I remember Stanley asked me to go up on one of the big parallels

Q: A parallel meaning a crane?

A: No. A parallel being a platform we built. Stanley didn’t like heights. I climbed up to look through the camera, to cover the explosions, while Stanley covered Kirk with the moving shots.

I don’t remember Stanley ever coming in with homework, and then did it. Then again, there’s no room in a scene like that for added ideas. It’s a done deal: show Kirk going through the battle. Make it look as uncomfortable and dangerous as it can possibly look, with explosions all around him. Kirk had to crawl through the cold water and muddy shell holes.

Q: You worked side by side every day with Kubrick for close to ten years. What was that like day-to-day?

A: I was required by Stanley to be there, because they don’t want them to see, or witness any indecision on their part, or anything that could indicate they’re not sure of what they’re doing. Openness to suggestion was one of Stanley’s great attributes. He genuinely thought any idea that was better than his was going to make the picture better.

Q: How did Kubrick deal with conflicts on the set? Did he raise his voice?

A: No. Stanley would never--not ever in the three pictures we did together--lose his temper. I don’t know if that changed after we went our separate ways. When we were together he was always able to outlast the other side of the argument, the DP. On the first day of principal photography, Ballard, by then very established and sought after, decided to lay a set of tracks and choose a lens contrary to what had been asked for. When Stanley discovered this, he repeated his first order. Ballard objected, ‘It’ll be fine like this. Nobody will notice.’ Stanley looked him in the eye and said quietly, rebuilt the tracks and they never had another bad moment.

Stanley would say to me, and then jot a note. Later we’d be walking down the hall, and if this person were coming at us the other way, Stanley would already be patting his pocket, ready to follow-up. That was a moment of panic for a few people. You could see it in their eyes when they had no answer.

We shot The Killing in 24 days; Paths of Glory in 66 days. We were getting up there,’ he’d smile and say: ‘Oh yeah? Watch this,’ and wham! We’d be back on.

Q: How would he do that?

A: He was fast on his feet


Q: What was the hardest part about directing for Kubrick?

A: Stanley would always say it was ‘the moment you arrive on the set each morning.’ It’s that way for every director. It was no different for Kubrick. You’ve got a city block filled with equipment, honeywagons. There you are pulling up, and dozens if not hundreds of people are looking straight at you. They’ve all got questions, and they need them answered right away. Everybody likes the idea of being a director--of being that guy that everybody looks to--but the reality is a whole other ballgame. You’ve got to be ready to answer, but you’ve got to keep your nerve and not answer too fast.

They talk now about how Kubrick disciplined himself with chess. It’s true. You’re staring at the board and you think, you could be building a trap for yourself. The same with filmmaking: You don’t want to be too attracted to an easy answer. An idea might look great on the surface, but create a world of problems up the line. And that applies if you’re in a bad spot. If some disaster happens, and everything’s capsized--keep your nerve. Don’t jump at the first easy answer. Look at your options. They’re there.

Q: Kubrick clearly knew what he wanted to do. Would he listen to other opinions?

A: Stanley had a very open mind. He encouraged contributions by other people. A number of suggestions I made, you weren’t criticized. He admired you; he admired anybody who thought enough about something to have an idea, with the intention of making it better. He’d say, ‘Look. The director’s going to get credit for everything in the picture, no matter where the idea comes from. If a lighting guy on the catwalk yells down, ‘Why don’t you try it from this angle,’ and that suggestion is better than the idea you had

If an idea makes a picture better, composed the ‘Love Theme,’ which Stanley loved. I picked Nelson Riddle to do the score. The first day we came to record the theme, we discovered that Nelson had written it in a minor key. As soon as he started to play it, I jumped out of my seat. ‘We can’t do this in a minor key. A minor key works if you’re doing horror, or suspense, but we don’t want that. The main love theme should be beautiful.’ Stanley welcomed that adjustment. He appreciated that I could discern a difference, overnight it was transposed into a major key

Q: After you parted ways and began directing for yourself

A: He not only gave me advice, people will bully you into thinking there’s something wrong with you if you don’t have a clear image of where every shot is, and where you’re going to put the camera. Stanley said, ‘It’s much better to discover your strategy with dialogue scenes. You want the actors to make a contribution. Don’t put them in a position where they’re told what to do--that you’ve already set up the first shot in your mind. They may feel more comfortable walking around, doing this or that.’ He often said: ‘Let the camera accommodate the actors. Don’t have the actors accommodate the camera.

Q: What did you learn about casting from Kubrick?

A: He always drilled into my head that you live or die by your choice of actors. They can be brilliant and bring to your film a dimension beyond your highest expectations. But they can also be incompetent, insecure, and the bearer of unlimited personal problems, which can easily affect the rest of the cast and turn the best-intended film into a shamble. He would say, ‘Unless you’re fortunate enough to have the financial wherewithal to replace a bad actor, you’re stuck with them for the rest of the schedule.'

Q: If you’re working with a well-chosen actor but something is wrong anyway

A: He told me there are three things you should carefully analyze, if they do know their lines, ask yourself: Do they know what the scene is about? If they do and it still won’t play, then the scene itself isn’t written properly. The essential talent of a director is that ability to know when a scene is off, for whatever reason.

Q: You and Kubrick shared a passion for music

A: As a director, have been based on previously published material. That novel or story is the melody. In movies, as in jazz, the melody is stated. The harmonics that go with it remain the same--but the soloist, or the instrumentalist, or even the full orchestra will do variations on these harmonics, making up their own melody
If an actor doesn’t know their lines

Q: Jazz also relies on improvisation. How did he feel about that?

A: The movies Stanley and I made relied on improvisations--but we didn’t want them to sound improvised. This is why rehearsal is so important. We’d have the actors try wild, but it’s clean. You don’t have a million ‘y’knows,’ and ‘likes’ all over the place. When the actors were handed those pages and came in knowing their lines, the result was magic.

Q: So ultimately

A: I did not have dreams of directing when I first met Stanley. My directing was totally impressed and influenced by his directing. When you see terrific athletes perform, genius, and leader. You can’t show weakness. You’ve got to supervise everybody, and answer all the questions from every department. It seemed so easy for Stanley.",,False,,False,t3_1dpqq3

Now for the artistic side of it. I really really loved the whole ""laughter"" motif that comes up. I'm not yet sure as to what it means as this is my first viewing but if you want to give me your two cents go ahead.

I also really enjoy the whole idea of the ""potion"" being made of secrets. That really wowed me. Also, and again I don't know what it means yet and if you want to go ahead and explain, I liked the part were Peggy Dodd and Freddie are doing exercises for Freddie's concentration and she says ""turn my eyes black. What color are they?"" and then he says ""black"" and then they turn black. I know that is symbolic of something I'm just not sure yet.

Superman was taught all of this, compassionate man, without powers and without ego; to be humble, and to never forget all of the values I cite above. He was taught all of these things by Jonathan and Martha Kent, and in those lonely moments of my life where I dreamed of having parents that would care for me and nurture me, as a boy I would think of the Kents and pray that my parents would change their mind, just for a day and treat me with the love and adoration that Clark was gifted with by the Kents. The House of El gave him life and a part of his identity, that all people deserved to be treated with compassion and trust

That was why it was so hard for me to swallow. Without getting caught up in the whys and wherefores of whether it was justified that Superman kills, for fear that the government would come and dissect him. Jonathan Kent in the film taught superman Paranoia and mistrust, to believe that he was truly alone, and that he should just take a beating over, and over again. Even in the face of his death, Jonathan forbade Clark from rescuing for the sake of a dog (I'll get back to this), to once again justify and reinforce his belief that humans are destructive, why in the name of hades would Clark even bother with accounting for the risk to human life? He certainly didn't when it came to levelling smallville, who wouldn't say ""screw the damned dog

Man of Steel for me is an elseworlds. It's a world where Superman is dark, causing damage on a massive scale and only having the thought to show regret after causing the damage he'd wrought. This is an esleworld where superman is nothing more than a menace that honestly, I don't blame lex and the U.S. government for wanting to put down, and that, as a Superman fan truly, honestly breaks my heart.

If you look at the prime nemesis of the DC live action universe - Marvel, positive message. Both stories, despite the damage are bright and optimistic in a way that man of steel should have been, and in both movies, as well as the Avengers, I feel it only pertinent to point out that before the brown stuff hits the fans, these two superheroes care about the people around them so much, and learns the value of his moral fibre in the process. Where was that in Man of Steel?

Honestly, who introduced the concept of dark, gritty adult comics - and because they sold so well, DC introduced more violence, more angst and more Drama into the comics, and thereby the films because as far as people are concerned, that's what people want. What's so wrong, and is completely unapologetic for its history. I feel that considering the fact that Kal El is 75 years old this year, and the one time Snyder tried

Ironically, and personally, I believe that we have too much of that in the film industry as a whole and that the one place in contrast that a film such as *Batman &amp; Robin* redeemed itself, was that it made room for characters such as Mr. Freeze and Clayface; it played entirely on the premise that there were supervillians in the world, and it *embraced* how utterly corny it was; When I watch Batman Begins or The Dark Knight, I don't see Gotham or Metropolis - I see Chicago and Illinois; Say what you will about *Superman Returns*, but one thing you *can* give Bryan Singer credit for is the fact that he painstakingly redressed part of a city in Australia to make it believably look like Metropolis - only a local would recognise some of the landmarks in the film, for me

I feel, and that means embracing and finding joy in the fantastical adversaries that we find  within the DC universe; people want and deserve escapism. They want and deserve the opportunity to close the doors of a cinema for two hours, dig into their popcorn and be taken away to a universe that is all but impossible, incompatible with the physics of our world, and my fear is that children today will have no memories of two hours like that in the way that I did; there is no *Flight of the Navigator* for this generation, or *Explorers*, or *The Goonies* (well. Ok. Pirates of The Caribbean to a certain degree) - There is no science fiction such as *The Last Starfighter*, and landing back in their seat being encouraged to simply *imagine the impossible*.

1365214233.0,1brw7t,Discussion: Upstream Color,huntersburroughs,111,13,86,"I just came out of seeing Upstream Color at the IFC Center a couple of hours ago

This was a wonderful film, in a good way. Its hard to spoil this film, and its hard to tell people to go see it since you can't really even summarize it more than Carruth already has, with the idea of characters getting caught in the life cycle of an organism.

The cinematography resembles films made by Terrence Malick, which tends to be played over different shots and scenes, creating a Malick-like voiceover effect. This isn't to say that Carruth is aping Malick, but the similarities are there, even beyond cinematography, with the story focusing on the relationship between the two main characters and how their love develops. 

The editing, Jean Luc Godard, Nicolas Roeg (in particular) and the John Boorman's Point Blank. When I asked Carruth about his influences, he had a hard time choosing a few out of many, but stated the French New Wave, Steven Soderbergh's The Limey and Jean Luc Godard's Vivre Sa Vie, all films that show an obvious link to Upstream Color's editing. 

Sound design was outstanding. The performances, but with this type of film performances tend to be overlooked among other elements. 

As for Carruth himself, their relationship and their journey, set in a challenging situation. Science fiction is the backdrop.

1368168754.0,1e21bf,Vertigo (1958),AstonMartin_007,109,13,10,"**NOTE: If you've seen Vertigo less than 3 times

I've had this urge to write about Vertigo for some time now. It is a film that has haunted me since I saw it a decade ago as a teenager and since the Blu-ray release, and it's been mostly frustrating. The range of reviews runs the gamut from psychoanalysts pushing their own elaborate interpretations (such as the theory that everything after the opening scene is merely a projection of Scottie's subconscious) to the more common but no less disheartening ""It's overrated and sucks"" comments. I suppose the reaction was understandable given that 50 years of film students have had Citizen Kane hammered into them, but this general unwillingness to consider the film itself, rather than theories or its critical ranking, has left me feeling rather uneasy about how people appreciate films.

To that end, I will try my best to remain grounded to the film itself, and where I do deviate from the celluloid, I shall reference the film for my reasoning. And as a disclaimer: This is not meant to be definitive, I'm fully aware there are other possible answers that work, as long I've succeeded in making you consider the story rather than dismiss it, that is enough.
___
**Plot**
___

* **Why is Scottie

I'll admit I don't know why some people have a problem with this. I think it's fairly easy to rationalize: He's been looking for the guy, a pursuit begins and he follows the policeman as backup. This willingness to help and pursue will of course define the film.
___
* **How does Scottie get down?**

Another one I don't know why people get hung up on. The cut from the roof to Midge's room has lead to some of the wilder theories about the film. In all seriousness, and he was rescued. Does any of this really need to be shown? No one asks how Lawrence ends up in the desert after blowing out the match.
___
* **How could Scottie and Midge be college classmates with their age difference?**

While filming, Midge was presumably in art classes.
___
* **What's with the murder plot?**

This is probably the biggest obstacle some people have with the film. After all

Well, leaves his room to make sure she's seen, puts her on a train and has her mail a postcard and pick up a trunk under Anna Thorwald's name. The deception works until Lars kills the neighborhood dog. Thus, a variant of the Vertigo plot was already a plot device in an earlier film; to paraphrase North by Northwest, ""It's an old Hitchcock trick, he's just freshened it up with ghost stories.""

Whether the murder scheme is acceptable or preposterous is a choice the viewer must make personally. However
___
* **What's the point of Carlotta Valdes?**

Carlotta Valdes seems like a misdirection tactic

We must remember that Gavin Elster's endgame is not to kill his wife, the '*power*' of her money and the '*freedom*' from his responsibilities. He may have married into his position, but he is not the dominant partner in the marriage; a wealthy powerful man would not be stuck against his will in a dull position tending to his wife's business.

At their first meeting, proving Madeleine's insanity was Elster's intention even *before* Scottie became involved. As for his reasons, we can only speculate, but it stands to reason that proving the last surviving member of a family was insane would remove a lot of legal impediments governing their estate. Pesky things such as wills and trusts become much easier to deal with. In the end, it's still all about the money.
___
* **Why does Scottie start following Madeleine?**

Scottie's reluctance and excuses disappear after seeing Madeleine at Ernie's. There is the obvious effect of Madeleine's ethereal beauty, a desire to covet which will eventually grow to overwhelm Scottie.
___
* **How does Madeleine disappear at the McKittrick Hotel?**

This is the granddaddy of Vertigo's supposed ""plot holes""

But I think I can lick it

1. The room is rented by a ""Carlotta Valdes""
2. She's had the room for 2 weeks
3. The clerk hasn't seen ""Carlotta Valdes"" come in.
4. ""Carlotta Valdes"" room key is on the rack.

These clues are given by the clerk

We see Madeleine in the room, and never stays long. The disappearance of Madeleine and her Jaguar suggests that there must be another entrance/exit in the hotel. What does it all mean?

I believe that the McKittrick Hotel is the meeting place for Gavin Elster and Judy's secret daytime affairs. Seen in this light, given to her by Elster, and only visits when their schedules allow. She probably has a job of her own and this is why she can never stay overnight. She brings Scottie to the McKittrick Hotel, after taking him to Carlotta's grave and portrait, because she knows, or has been advised, that it is the one place where she can shake off Scottie's tail.

Can I prove it? No, but more importantly it changes the nature of the entire scene, from an oddity in the narrative, to poetic: Judy, while off the job, meets a man who persuades her to quit her job, accompany him and eventually take on a new identity. Also, and Madeleine's reminisces about the room where she sits ""alone, which leads to the kiss with Scottie at the seaside.

It is also worth noting that there is no particular reason to mention any of these clues if Hitchcock merely wanted to create a mysterious scene. Vertigo went through 4 writers and a year's delay

&gt;Truffaut: *By the way
a scene

&gt;Hitchcock: *Why should we do that

___
* **Why does Madeleine jump into San Francisco Bay?**

From Elster's viewpoint

1. It is a relatively safe way for Madeleine to appear suicidal. The Coroner's Inquest will refer to this as a ""previous aberration"".
2. It allows Scottie and Madeleine to meet
3. Their subsequent conversation will establish her mental state
4. Now that Scottie and Madeleine know each other

What Elster doesn't count on is Madeleine's growing sympathy for Scottie. Eventually, which is certainly what Elster does by having her jump into the Bay. Scottie's treatment of her in his apartment is delicate, perhaps even reverential, a refreshing change from the manipulative Elster.
___
* **How could Elster be sure Scottie wouldn't make it through the trapdoor at the top of the tower?**

This is the hole Hitchcock refers to in Hitchcock/Truffaut, one that does not exist in the script:

&gt;MADELEINE IS RUNNING UP THE STAIRS OF THE TOWER: SCOTTIE STRUGGLING DESPERATELY AFTER HER. SHE REACHES THE TOP, SLAMS THE DOOR BEHIND HER AND **LOCKS IT**. SHE TURNS. GAVIN ELSTER STANDS NEAR THE OPEN ARCH, HOLDING HIS WIFE FAST...

[The lock does exist in the film.](http://i.imgur.com/TTeQD7L.png) Therefore, he still won't prevent the body from falling. The question then becomes: Why would Hitchcock sabotage his own story?

For Judy. This is not the first time Hitchcock deviates from the script to make Judy a more sympathetic character; When Madeleine first meets Scottie at Ernie's, this is how it is in the script and how it was originally filmed (this can be seen in the trailer). After filming completed, Hitchcock had second thoughts and ordered producer Herbert Coleman to reshoot Kim Novak's glance without the smile. His reason was that he didn't want the audience to sense something wrong so early in the film, but his revision also changes the character: a smile at an intended victim is a sinister action.

So, this simple inaction on Judy's part also has broader implications: Elster is shown that Judy can't be totally relied upon, and this gives him a reason, if he needed it, for ditching her. Judy's terrified glances at the trapdoor after the body is thrown also take on new meaning: she knows the door is unlocked and there's a possibility Scottie could come up. The argument could be made that she is trying to warn Elster while he covers her mouth and backs them into hiding. This also provides a rebuttal to those who believe the flashback is unnecessary: We are shown the mistake Judy makes that nearly undoes Elster's careful planning.

Seen in this context
___
* **If Scottie sees Madeleine's body

Yes, most importantly, he is the only suspicious character at the crime scene. Under these circumstances, the only one who could ID the body is Elster himself, and for all the criticisms of the murder plot, one can't help but admire Elster's calculated daring. In one fell stroke, he has killed his wife, and landed Scottie in the hot seat. It's an inspired move.
___
* **What happens to Midge?**

Midge's exit from Vertigo rubs some people the wrong way. From the narrative perspective, it also makes sense. Midge's line, ""I don't think Mozart is going to help at all"", is a confession of her own inability to reach Scottie emotionally. She's seen to what depths Scottie can fall for someone, and knows that she'll never be able to engender the same reaction.

[Her exit shot also echos Madeleine's ""Walking down a corridor into darkness and death"" line](http://i.imgur.com/H3I4tIy.png). In Midge's case
___
* **It's a huge coincidence that Scottie bumps into Judy again.**

Not really for Hitchcock, and then extremely conveniently having her walk into the Chicago hotel when Thornhill tries to find Kaplan.

Furthermore
___
* **Why doesn't Judy recognize Scottie at her door?**

This scene is often used to attack Kim Novak's acting, this assumes that Judy doesn't know Scottie has followed her; I shall try to show that she does.

We must back up slightly to the first time Scottie sees Judy. Judy is walking up the sidewalk with her friends, by Hitchcock. In the ensuing shot she scratches her arm, which can be taken as a nervous reaction. While Scottie follows her, Judy appears to be smoking from a distance. This is the only time Madeleine/Judy exhibits this behavior, and Kim Novak didn't smoke in real life. As she lowers her hand, a white sedan drives up the road and starts blocking our view of Judy. Hitchcock waits until the sedan is in the middle of the frame before cutting to Scottie. When Judy goes into the Empire Hotel and opens her window, we think she's just glancing at the view

If we accept this sequence of events, Judy slowly backs away and places her hands on the telephone behind her back. She has weighed her options and decided seeing Scottie is worth the risk; as she will later tell him, ""I was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove!""
___
* **Is the flashback necessary?**

One of the things I find annoying is people's willingness to toy with key elements of Vertigo

To be sure, for instance, is completely nonsensical (newsflash to Mr. Hitchcock: critical flops do not create stars) especially given his later treatment of Miles. His statement that ""Everyone around [him] was against [the flashback]"" is a bald-faced lie, almost the complete opposite of reality. It's now known to a fair degree of certainty that writer Sam Taylor came up with the flashback and Vertigo as we know it was given a limited preview in San Francisco for, among others, Paramount Head Barney Balaban. Balaban himself loved Vertigo and immediately returned to New York to begin promotion. Meanwhile someone, likely Joan Harrison (Hitchcock's TV producer), and Hitchcock arranged a viewing without it. Hitchcock then ordered the film released without the flashback, the latter infuriated to the point of nearly resigning. This decision may even have contributed to Vertigo's critical failure: Unbeknownst to Balaban, that the flashback was reinstated. If there's one thing to takeaway from Hitchcock's lie

Narratively, her genuine horror at the sight of the real Madeleine's body, and the way Elster manipulates her rather than having her assist him. None of this would have been possible to convey without the flashback, short of a clunky expository scene at the end *à la* Psycho. Indeed, that was how Alex Coppel, the 2nd writer on Vertigo dealt with the problem; in a document titled ""Confessions on Tower"", he listed 25 details the dialog had to explain at the end. One wonders how much taller the tower would have had to be to fit in that conversation. 

In terms of character, we are completely left in the dark as to why Judy allows Scottie to transform her, and later on, whether her feelings for Scottie were ever genuine or simply manipulative. Judy's character is the heart of Vertigo, it is what provides meaning during subsequent viewings and what ultimately elevates Vertigo from a strange murder mystery to a haunting emotional allegory.
___
* **Why does Gavin Elster leave Judy in San Francisco

In the same way the flashback serves as an insight for Judy, I don't think the word convoluted necessarily applies. The twists and turns of the murder plot are to me analogous to the feints a chess master uses to disguise their endgame. Like a chess master though, he is not without his weaknesses.

While he is extremely exact about the mechanics of the plot, it is unknown whether he is, or ever was serious about taking Judy away with him. However, killing her is out of the question, it is a rash decision with minimal benefit, unforeseen risks, and no clear alibi, he is very safe in leaving Judy: He knows Scottie believes Madeleine is dead
___
* **Why does Judy wear Carlotta's necklace?**

It seems like an awful choice, it seems like it has a good chance of working. Judy genuinely cares for Scottie, and while Scottie may be fixated on the facade rather than the personality within, there is also no hint of friction between them; he appears fond of her and totally at ease, giving every indication that their relationship is meant to last, which of course makes the end all the more tragic.

But Hitchcock doesn't have the time, the movie has to end somewhere. And in choosing Carlotta's necklace as Judy's ""slip"", it creates a lot of interesting insights into both Judy and Scottie's characters.

In Judy's case, she looks kinda cute to me) and her hotel room is very plain. Thus, there is one detail that has always stood out to me: her jewelry.

[When Madeleine dons the infamous grey suit

[When Judy first meets Scottie, it could be an awful jumping joke. However, given his careful nuanced approach to Vertigo, I prefer a subtler interpretation: Whereas Madeleine could fly away (and Gavin does just that) from Scottie, Judy is grounded and can never escape his reach.

I also think a backstory could be inferred from the 2 brooches. I've always considered the brooches as vestiges of Elster's courtship of Judy. It isn't hard to imagine Elster visiting a store (Magnin's?), and later buying her the bird brooch to signify his intention of ultimately marrying her. I link the brooches to Elster because Judy doesn't seem to place a lot of care in her own appearance and decor. There is also the intriguing story of Elster watching Madeleine wear Carlotta Valdes jewelry and looking at herself in the mirror, ""going into that other world and becoming someone else"".

In Scottie's case, he never saw it in real life. His only memory of it is from Carlotta's portrait, and this to me is an astonishing insight into his frame of mind.

He may have fallen in love with Madeleine, but Carlotta does prominently. Recall Scottie's line at the beginning, *""I wake up at night seeing that man fall from the roof and I try to reach out to him...""* Scottie is terrified of the notion that Carlotta Valdes can reach out from beyond the grave, it violates every principle of his factual detective persona. The idea that the dead can cross over onto the living plane is what seizes and propels him for the 2nd half of Vertigo. It is what causes him to lose sight of reality and the loving Judy in front of him. After all, if the dead can manipulate the living, if the dead can change reality to suit their whims, why can't he?

When he brings Judy to San Juan Batista, I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chance Judy, you're my second chance!""* This, like so many other lines in Vertigo, has a double meaning. On one hand, he's referring to his failure to ascend the tower the first time. On the other, this is his second chance to find the key and explain Madeleine's *""beautiful phony trances""*. He *craves* a rational explanation, in a poetic nod to the flashback scene's placement in the movie

To get back to the question: Why does Judy wear Carlotta's necklace? She owns very little jewelry and most of it is probably from Elster. She thinks, that she has become the object of his haunting. She believes she is the sole woman in his mind, the only one he can't forget and the only one whose appearance is indelible. 

It is a terrible miscalculation of the damage she has wrought on his psyche
___
**Vertigo - A turning point**
___

Vertigo's critical and commercial fizzle in 1958 is infamous. It was undoubtedly a harsh blow

Bernard Herrmann was probably the least affected, he completed the Vertigo score in 1 month, 13 days; He would echo his themes from Vertigo in each Hitchcock collaboration afterwards and later on in his 1965 String Quartet, 1967 Clarinet Quintet and second to last film score, Obsession (1976). Not being able to conduct the Vertigo score would always be a regret of his; due to an AFM strike in 1958, Muir Mathieson had to conduct, first in London and later in Vienna using Mono recording which, is partly responsible for the lower fidelity of Vertigo's soundtrack compared to North by Northwest. In 1969

James Stewart had already been feeling the years creep up on him, a sign that even with Hitchcock, his name could no longer be counted on to draw audiences. Indeed, he lost the lead in North by Northwest to Cary Grant, and while the immensity of his persona and talent meant he could bounce back in films like Anatomy of a Murder, his later films are mostly ensemble pieces. His last romantic lead role was right after Vertigo in Bell, Book, a fulfillment of the obligation he made to procure Novak from Columbia for Vertigo. Stewart and Hitchcock would never work again

Alfred Hitchcock remains somewhat of an enigma. There is a sense that with Vertigo he was trying to break out of his populist suspense entertainer persona, a play that had captivated him since 1920 and which he constantly referred to while making Vertigo. It is perhaps a recognition of his failure that, when discussing Mary Rose in the '60s, he told Truffaut: ""You should make the picture. You would do it better. It's not really Hitchcock material."" While there are many merits to some of his later films, it's undeniable that Hitchcock never again attempted a film with the emotional subtlety and depth of Vertigo. Beginning with Psycho, he would aim for shock value, and starting with North by Northwest, but perhaps with traveling salesman Jimmy Stewart instead of Mad Man Cary Grant. Psycho is less assured, Truffaut was ""convinced that Hitchcock was
not satisfied with any of the films he made after Psycho.""

Kim Novak was famously not the first choice for her roles in Vertigo, and Paramount, agent Lew Wasserman, and Jimmy Stewart were interested in her for Vertigo from the start. Her loan-out from Columbia would end up costing $250,000 and Stewart's participation in a Columbia production. She was never a self-confidant actress; pressed into the business without any acting experience in 1954 and under the control of tyrannical and crass Columbia Head Harry Cohn, Novak was never really allowed any of the comforts stars typically receive. Her salary was so terrible she had to raid Rita Hayworth's old wardrobe for public appearances; She received a meager $750/week for Vertigo, while Cohn pocketed the difference from the $2, she tended toward dramatic roles to expand her talent. She approached Vertigo from the beginning as a psychologically complex role, combined with Hitchcock's public statements against her, unwilling to maintain her actress persona. It is unknown how a successful Vertigo might have changed her career

**The Greatest Film of All Time**

Unfortunately, saying the Sight &amp; Sound poll is the most legitimate is the same to me as calling someone the most honest lawyer, they may be true statements, but they still ring rather hollow. For my part, Vertigo is my personal #1, but I'd never call it ""the greatest of all time"", because such a film cannot by definition ever exist. In fact I'll go even further and say that every single film on the Sight &amp; Sound poll is overrated by default

I'm often asked why I love Vertigo so much, not watching them. Perhaps this is the only way I can explain: I have a very bad habit of overwatching the films I like to death. Sometimes this results in me being unable to watch them again, other films I have to ration to preserve their impact. They've simply become clichés in my brain, so that I'm unconsciously anticipating lines and scenes and generally ruining the whole experience.

In the case of Vertigo however, and hopefully more mature, its power seems as undeniable as ever. This is despite being by far my most rewatched film (the first time I borrowed the DVD, I saw Vertigo twice everyday for 2 weeks; I was 13, 10 years ago). Every time I view Vertigo, I ask myself, ""Am I really going to fall for this crazy murder scheme, Kim Novak can't act, the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Any architect could state that the whole thing is an engineering fiasco

Even Merry touches on how the events taking place should rightly touch all of Middle-Earth's inhabitants when he tries to persuade treebeard to fight against Isengard by saying ""But you're a part of this world!""

This broad scope is contrasted with the narrowness at which the world is portrayed to us on the screen. When we first see Edoras, a capital of one of the two nations of men that are left in this world, but based on how many people show up to Helms Deep from there at the end of the film, there cannot be more than a few hundred inhabitants. The same is true of Isengard; a massive tower housing one of the most powerful wizards of the age. Yet, before we see Saruman turn it into an orc plan, it stood alone. Where are those who sought out his advice? Hell where are the rest of the people who live in the tower? Are we to assume that a powerful Maiar sweeps all the floors of his giant several hundred foot high castle? The same is true later in RotK. Minas Tirith just looks too...small to be the capital of the largest nation of men in Middle Earth.

But more problematic, or tending fields. In fact the only place in the film that actually has a sense of being a real place, is the Shire.

First off, and I'd like to have a good discussion about it, I posted anyway.


Here's my underlying question: Am I missing something about David Lynch and his films (that he directed)? In my opinion, Blue Velvet, Eraserhead*), his films are erratic, confusing, poorly edited and difficult to emerse yourself into. It seems to me that the way he develops characters is very shallow. Take Blue Velvet for example - While I did enjoy Rosselini's character, the rest were so flat and bland - the girlfriend was predictable, his 'gang' were traditional flunkies... Even the main character felt like he was simply floating through the events without an actually emotional experience.

Then we get to Dune. I loved the book. And while Frank Herbert's writing style is a little different, even for 1984 when the film came out. Compare it to *A New Hope*, or *2001: A Space Odyssey*.

*Eraserhead*, but mostly for the austerity of the concept, and the animatronics and puppetry, which I almost alway enjoy. However, the characters and dialogue again are stiff. Granted in this film it works well, and I feel like the success of this film was probably the reason why he got funding for the following ones, because, the rest sucked IMO.


So am I missing something? I don't mean to be too critical of the guy, but I feel like he's super trumped up and over-rated. Am I alone in this? Is there some kind of perspective that I'm missing?

When I started becoming a very serious fan of film, strange ways in which a camera panned through a scene. I noticed when directors used boring static shots, and I realized why movies I had found dull before failed.

I'm no film student

When I watched The Truman Show, I found that shots... were boring! For those of you who do not know, The Truman Show is a movie about a man whose entire life has been secretly broadcast as a television program. He lives on a island-sized ""studio"", and his life was recorded with hidden cameras.

Anyway... shots. Boring. Why did I still love this film?

Specific instances include this one car scene, pounds adventurous, tense music). Yet it is mostly conveyed through shots such as [this](http://www.gonemovies.com/WWW/XsFilms/SnelPlaatjes/Truman18EscapeCar.jpg). A little hidden camera, possibly on his rear-view mirror.

Arguably one of the most emotional scenes in the movie

It sure aint as great a shot as [this](http://www.amovieaweek.com/images/clip_image003_0000.jpg). It's ridiculously far from it.

Why does The Truman Show work so well though (barring the great performances and epic [kinda cheesy

The answer obvious. The shots are like that in an ironic way. And not the hipster kind of ironic either

Now when I said ""ironic"" I meant it. This scene has different forms of irony in it. It has dramatic irony, because you wouldn't expect the most emotional scene in the movie to be shot in such a... well, shitty and anticlimactic way. This, and the feeling of perversion described above ties in to the point of the movie. The director, played by [Ed Harris](http://www.wearysloth.com/Gallery/ActorsH/7499-24033.gif) is doing something that he feels is art, that he feels is necessary and beautiful, is actually extermely perverse. Knowing what Truman doesn't know, his [best friend](http://www.wearysloth.com/Gallery/ActorsE/20238-24033.gif)... even his [MOTHER](http://www.wearysloth.com/Gallery/ActorsT/16924-24033.gif) are all being fed lines for the sake of ratings... we are meant to be *disgusted*. 

This goes back to the shot. That shot with the father? ""We shouldn't be seeing this""? 

It's strange how purposefully making your shots look crappy was the best decision for this movie. It fits the narrative, I admit. If the movie weren't so brilliant in every other regard, it would definitely be one of those movies where you just go ""Christ,  I get it, exploiting and deceiving people is bad; television and entertainment media are headed in a dangerous direction"").

I just thought of another reason! When Truman finally escapes the studio, to me, some of the most [evocative imagery](http://www.urantiansojourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/the-truman-show.jpg) I have ever seen in a movie.

So

The story is what gives us the emotional connection! Bending it weakens that experience. 

I suppose that you could apply this thinking to found-footage films. A lot of people rag on the style. I feel like early attempts such as The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield didn't work for *practical* reasons... it was hard for audiences to understand what was going on and it actually made us nauseous.

What I conclude from it is that I find it a narrative of the burdens of the cliche ""Hollywood lifestyle"" and the viewpoint of a delusional failed actress


The amnesiac, fueled by envy. She formed her as a down on her luck person who had no idea where she was, and needed guidance (because of her amnesia).


While the movie progresses, where out of NOWHERE, the film completely changes direction. When I say out of nowhere, I mean it. Seriously spontaneous. Plus, in the last 10 minutes, a scene is shown where a scene from the very beginning (two men, completely unrelated are sitting and eating in a diner), she bends down to clean and her nametag shows ""Betty"". Coincidence? I think not. This is the real Betty. Nothing more than a waitress which no one will remember


The omniscient blue box though, since it was Rita, who had placed the box in the belongings of the creature. Or perhaps the box is the ultimate home of our aspiring actress. The key is the fame that would have saved her from being locked in that box, and the monster is the failed homeless person she will end up, and the man who gets killed by it in the beginning signifies her dreams.

1342002501.0,wdnle,Thoughts on Paul Thomas Anderson's Punch-Drunk Love ,Fintann,95,8,27,"With the lead up to PTA's new film, communication

The very first shot in the film is of Barry Egan in his workspace. The first thing to take note of here is the color blue; Barry is dressed in an unusual but defining blue suit that seemingly matches and fades into the surrounding walls. Here we are introduced to the character and 'his color'. Why this is important is that it already tells somewhat about Barry before he's done or said anything. He hides away in his work and tries to blend in to a strange and poor fashion.  

The blue is soon accompanied by a new color; red, while an inconspicuous red figure is floating at the other end of the aisle. This very subtle, almost subliminal, placement of red alludes to love coming to Barry (despite his obliviousness to it, spending the rest of the night on a sex-line [possibly implying that people overlook love and go for sex]). Although Lena is represented by red, her next appearance she is seen wearing purple. In this scene, she begins the courting process and seemingly reaches over towards the blue, a closer color to him may make him more comfortable about it. While driving home from their date

From here Barry must go after Lena to find his happiness, he runs in the direction that a [red arrow](http://cineprism.files.wordpress.com/2007/09/jumping_red-arrow.jpeg) points him in. When he arrives in Hawaii he and Lena connect and with flashes of blue lens flare, they make their way back to her hotel room. In the next scene we see both of them wearing different clothing than usual. Lena is in a white shirt and pink pajamas, a lighter more happy and uplifted version than her usual red. She's in a better place now that Barry is with her, something important in showing this isn't just a one sided relationship. Barry, for the first and only time isn't wearing his suit, he's wearing a clean white bathrobe. He finally feels clean an no need to hide himself to Lena

The lens flares found in the scene just prior to the aforementioned scene, shows his blue light emanating through to the end of the phone call. It all comes to a head when Mattress Man looses it and tells him he's dead, when the light is shifted from blue to purple. This shift to purple acts as the power of Lena but more likely love coming into Barry's newfound confidence (as he says ""the love of the woman makes more powerful than anything""), along with showing Mattress Man's breaking of confidence by Barry's love. The blue flares come in again with the face-to-face confrontation with Mattress Man when Barry finally stands up for himself, then again with Lena right afterwards when he brings the Harmonium to her place and to explain everything. The use of color becomes a very strong technique that conveys emotions and feelings that can't really be done with dialogue or acting. 

Another hidden meaning within the film is the aspect of 'Travel'. Barry's journey begins with him picking up a harmonium from the side of the street. In the the jump cut to him running back to his office with the piano, driving at a very relaxed pace, reflecting a more calmed state of mind as from before. What travel comes to represent in the film is dating and relationships. Barry, like many people just simply don't travel. They find no reason to or nowhere to go, such as with relationships. However Barry, through his pudding frequent flyer miles, comes up with a way to travel. Unfortunately he has nowhere or reason to go; even when Lena asks him why he's saving it he says he doesn't know. With Lena it's the opposite, but she's done the dating thing and has even been married once

For Barry at the time he's already comfortable, he wants to be with her and he's got a lot of love to give. 

The strongest of all symbolism that I find in Punch-Drunk Love is the use of music. In the opening of the film, each of them show up in Barry's life with Lena pretending to need car repairs just to see Barry (strangely enough she somewhat gets him to take in the Harmonium too). Several things happen when Barry first plays the Harmonium, a light slowly reveals his face, and the main theme of the score begin playing. With Luis Guzman's character's arrival, he asks Barry what is it and where did it come from; to which Barry simple replies ""I don't know"". The same with falling in love.  

The score in Punch-Drunk Love almost more than background music, he goes to the Harmonium for comfort. When his sister arrives at the shop with Lena, after the sex line call he fixes the harmonium before canceling his credit card, after punching the wall he plays a few notes. The harmonium is something he doesn't know how to play yet but he knows it brings him joy and comfort, a reflection of his love life.  

While on their date, but what is going to come of it. The question is reflects the ideal of simply acquiring the necessary pieces isn't enough; both music and a relationship require constant care, or 'practice'. Barry doesn't seem to know very much about piano or music, and it comes across when he's playing out little note groupings of the main theme. However as the film comes to a close and Lena comes to meet him at his work, we find Barry beginning to sit down at the Harmonium and playing with two hands and in sync with the score of the film; a reflection of where he's come to in his love life. Music is an expressive language, it conveys emotions on very base and raw level; as such it can convey things words can't. Barry's character has trouble controlling some of his base emotions (anger, sadness

What I love about this film is not there's a ton of thematic symbolism, but I feel PTA's filmmaking hit a huge improvement upon an already amazing ability. With Boogie Nights, he gave a tone to story telling and narrative unseen in mainstream film. Magnolia did the same but stayed serious the whole time, however it is arguably verbose in terms of it's massive story. Punch-Drunk Love stopped and sized everything down and started off small and simple, then seemingly let itself grow in themes and meaning.

Throughout the film we are presented with several unreliable narrators presenting their testimony during the depositions. This is especially brought to light by Rashida Jones exchange with Mark at the end:

&gt;Mark Zuckerberg: I'm not a bad guy. 

&gt;Marylin Delpy: I know that. When there's emotional testimony

&gt;Mark Zuckerberg: And the other fifteen? 

&gt;Marylin Delpy: Perjury. Creation myths need a Devil. 

Before I go any further, where we're not meant to get the whole truth.

Essentially the film is framed by these depositions. We see events happening as characters describe them. Basically, we can't assume they really happened like people said they did.

If you can notice them, is Zuckerberg even responsible?

And what about Eduardo? Why was he ejected from the company? Was it because of Sean? Was it because he made a financial threat to the company because he felt he was being left out? Was it because of Mark's jealousy that Eduardo got into the club

It is because this entire film is the trial Mark Zuckerberg never got. And we are the jury. The film ends with him at his computer trying to get a friend request approved from Erica, waiting for the friend request.

And he'll sit there and wait. An approval would mean forgiveness

*This is an examination of a film I have not previously watched. Weeks prior to viewing the Coen Brothers’ Barton Fink, his reality still manifests as fiction, distorted by horrific delusions and violent attitudes. In an effort to be as real as possible, the writer stumbles into the surreal.*

The opening shot ushers in descent, dissatisfaction or fear.

Three key questions are presented

**Where is the Common Man found?**

**What are the untold stories?**

**Will a writer write an escape from reality or instead the Common Reality?**

In the eyes, we see Mr. Fink’s entanglement with these questions. A dinner party follows the play’s ending (note: how the film begins with the fictional end.) Friends-of-friends compliment the “greatness” of the production, even the playwright’s genius. But Mr. Fink expresses his own inner-critique—the play is simply not good enough.

A crash of ocean waves begins the next scene. In contrast to the dinner party’s elegance, seeking what he terms “real success,” not simply financial betterment.

Urged by a fellow colleague, rather hollow and empty for Mr. Fink. We sense the Disconnect, his dissociation from these unfamiliar surroundings. The writer wonders, where and how will inspiration occur?

Despite a steep weekly rent

He sits before his Underwood. By the look on his face and our knowledge of its potential “for success, “A DAY OR A LIFETIME.” Above it, a painting hangs of a woman staring at the sea, relaxed on a shorefront. The ocean crashes, frozen.

Mr. Fink lies in bed that night, studying insignificant details so as to understand their significance.

The following day, just over Mr. Fink’s shoulder, are of two Greek-looking men bearing the globe upon their shoulders separately. Is this the pressure he feels? Is the pressure self-imposed or expected of him?

    “We don’t need to tackle the world this time around.”

    “We need it to have that Barton Fink Feeling.”

    “We’re all expecting great things.”

    —Mr. Lipnick

Mr. Fink is now in his room

    “FADE IN

    A tenement building on Manhattan’s Lower East Side. Early morning traffic is audible.”

He seems displeased, as the scene is interrupted with a man crying through the wall next door.

Through a short sequence of events, a burly man, a “common man.”

Where is the Common Man found? Here

Mr. Fink is contradictory in his behavior, Charlie apologizes to him for the commotion. But Mr. Fink owes an apology for assuming his work is more important than those suffering around him. How can he properly write of pain when he assumes he is above it? This is the common dilemma of the writer and the introvert. He wishes to write for the people with whom he wants nothing to do with.

    Charlie says

    Barton exclaims

What are the untold stories? The writer writes of the common man, not the Common Man. And for a third time, before leaving, Charlie says, “I could tell you some stories.”

The typewriter is waiting for more. We now see the amended sentence:

    “Early morning traffic is audible

Will a writer write an escape from reality or instead the Common Reality? This is reliant on the observation of a few key details, the background our focus. It is filmed as if we are meant to subtly realize how self-absorbed he is, how a great deal of the film’s perception is stuck within the writer’s head.

    “You’re just a tourist with a typewriter. I live here

    —Charlie

Other key details are color and alcohol. The color white represents a blank palette, Mr. Fink dresses in more earthen shades of browns, greens, and yellows. This color scheme is also true for their environments. Mr. Lipnick’s office is white, and Mr. Fink’s hotel room is dark, more associated with the Common Man. The handling of alcohol in this film is used primarily for diluting pain. Anyone who drinks is suffering. It is only after the film’s momentous and violent turn-around that Mr. Fink swallows a whole glass.

We read and entertain ourselves to escape the dullness of living. These people are upset, suffers as an alcoholic (note: how Mr. Mayhew believes writing comes from inner and outer peace, whereas, Mr. Fink believes writing comes from inner or outer pain.)

    Charlie says

    Barton says

We are halfway through the film and Mr. Fink has only written those first few sentences. He is set to meet with Mr. Lipnick in less than twenty-four hours. He needs the whole three acts to his wrestling picture, or the end (note: how we are in the film’s middle, just as unaware as he.) “You don’t have to write scenes,” a female friend of his says. But that is the easy part for Mr. Fink, and that is why he cannot understand the Common Man he wishes to write for. Everyday people find it difficult to get through their daily routine. For Fink, the day is easy. It is not the scenes that matter. What he is most concerned with is the overall structure, the acts, he will feel out-of-touch. He may dress and live like one but he does not yet feel like one.

    Barton says

    Charlie says

The wallpaper of his hotel room peels, he finishes the script. He titles it. He turns it into Mr. Lipnick. But Hollywood has no use for this work, despite Mr. Fink believing it is the best work he has ever written. “I wanted to show you something beautiful,” he tells Mr. Lipnick. But any writer can offer that “Barton Fink” feeling. Whatever resides in his head is not special among the rest. Mr. Lipnick wanted what was good for Hollywood.

The ending is satisfactory because we are given the comfort that Mr. Fink learned from his pain. He apologized to the Common Man for his arrogance. He never sought to appease the color-absent executives. The film’s closing is left for pondering—Mr. Fink must better understand the struggle of the scene in order to tackle the overall meaning of his own living film.

    “I’ll show you the life of the mind! I’ll show you the life of the mind!
    I will show you the life of the mind!”

**Notes: I wrote this awhile ago

*[originally posted on my website

**EDIT:** Thank you

**EDIT, or on the contents of the package Charlie hands Barton before he leaves for New York will be greatly appreciated."")...

...I figured the contents of the package were much like the contents of the briefcase in Pulp Fiction. The package may have had some significance to the character giving it, or even to the film's writer(s).* The girl's severed head, perhaps? However, while that may fit, given all the details, it does not seem very satisfying. I assumed the content's ambiguity was more important than the contents themselves, *simply because Barton is left at the film's closing with a very ambiguous air about him.* He seems unsure, as we can see from the comments in this thread that many interpretations are perfectly feasible.

Ambiguity begets discovery. Barton is on the horizon of discovery

...As for ""any speculation on the murder, he entered a sort of vision, not necessarily a dream but a fantastical re-imagining of reality. (Note: as Barton and his lady friend are engaged in intercourse, the camera travels to the bathroom and runs down the drain, into the pipeline where moans are echoed. It's sort of like descending into another tale of fantasy, just as the film began with a descent into reality.) This interpretation holds up as the ending of the film centers with him sitting on a beach, the female stranger lying before him in the sand, trying to think of what to write.

Once the murder occurs

However

So my next assumption was that Barton had killed her and conveniently forgot

However

Charlie does say to Barton later on

The murder confounds me. The descent-into-the-pipeline transition strikes me as being vital to understanding the murder. I avoided from writing of this Act in the film, and details; secondly, I am not sure if there is a firm answer to any speculation on the murder. Its happening forces us into ambiguity, much like Barton being handed a mysterious package he has no intent of opening, just carrying around.

Perhaps

*“I’ll show you the life of the mind! I’ll show you the life of the mind! I will show you the life of the mind!”*

**EDIT

    Also the action of the film is set during the onset of America's involvement in WWII.
    Pearl Harbor actually happens and Fink seems to make no mention of it
    demonstrating how self involved and introverted he has actually become.

Reality goes on without Barton Fink.

**EDIT, I found fitting closure (personally, at least.) There is no ""straight fiction"" or ""straight reality."" Barton's vision of ""real theatre"" is as much fantastical as any other. And Barton's striving for absolute reality forced him into absolute fantasy.

make a quick buck. 

Firstly I'd like to say Sydney Lumet does a fantastic job with directing, and he harnesses, what I'm sure would been a long and rambling script, and uses it to it's maximum potential.


IMO what makes this movie fantastic is the string of monologues throughout the movie that make the movie come to life. You can feel the movie screaming at you. This type of movie comes along every once in a while awhile and seems obligatory. Modern day equivalents would be God Bless America, this is something a lot of indie films, or any film for the matter, get wrong. All of the characters in Network are very well developed, they all have personalities and you are able to understand and connect with them before the movie goes into high gear. Every character has a unique voice nothing is dishonest which helps your suspension of disbelief and prevents you from feeling the movie is trying to teach you something. This is where the success of the movie lies, it so easily could have turned into a rambling, preachy


As far as getting a message across goes I've always preferred this method. With the exception of the abstract


**So what did you guys think of Network?** 

Personally I thought the last shot, a subtle comment on how impersonal everything is and how business and products saturate everything. I also loved the monologue near the end delivered by the business executive

Compliance (2012)",LiteraryBoner,117,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1ajth3/never_posted_to_rtruefilm_before_was_looking_for/

For those of you who don't know

I watched this movie after seeing it in a few of those ""Cringeworthy movies"" threads or the ""Good movies you will never watch again"" I was ready for it to get really messed up, yes, it was a very shocking movie. But they showed a lot less than some filmmakers might have and it gave a respectful tone to the film rather than seemingly being made to shock it seemed like it was more made to raise awareness of the weakness of people, the seemingly unprovoked evil of some, and the dynamics of authority.
What hit me hard about this movie was simply the fact that it's a true story. This was happening in the 90's and early 2000's and this movie is not only based off of those events, it would be considered too ridiculous. The events are bizarre and falls under the so weird it has to be true genre.

The characters were really well set up in this movie. While the prank call starts only about 10-15 minutes into the movie and lasts well over an hour, I found the manager to be a very compelling character. In the beginning we see so much about her in so little time. You can see that she doesn't hate Becky (the victim/employee) but she is very jealous of her ability to be wanted by young attractive men, and the juxtaposition of Sandra (the manager) being excited about being engaged to a middle aged redneck while Becky flippantly scrolls through pics young men send her really established their dynamic. I was only able to imagine how much it must suck being a middle aged manager of a fast food restaurant getting no respect from employees half your age and knowing they are going to leave that place to find their life while your life is that restaurant. Sandra's jealousy of Becky doesn't really come into play later, but it is a fascinating dynamic that I think added to the tension once Sandra was given true power over Becky by the caller. The scene where Becky pleaded for help, naked, to Sandra and Sandra yelled, ""Why are you talking to me!? Don't talk to me!"" was much more powerful with this relationship dynamic pretense.
Another thing I liked about this movie was the writing. It was very reminiscent of Hard Candy (another great movie you will surely enjoy if you liked Compliance, even though it is established early on that the manager is easily the weakest person working there. (Established by her employees laughing while she was talking to them about leaving the freezer open, and also her super awkward and probably false confession that her fiance sexts her, it was obvious to me she only wanted to be liked and respected by Becky which is why she said that.)

Another interesting moment was at the very end when [Spoiler](/s ""the manager was being interviewed on 60 Minutes and her lawyer warned her not to answer a question. The interviewer was obviously annoyed with the restrictions and also obviously thought very lowly of the manager. She recognized this and all of a sudden changes the subject to where he is from and makes a joke about it. She used the same tactics as the prank caller to get the interviewer back on her side."") I thought this was really interesting, some simple information gathering (""Ah yes, Becky, we have Rebecca on the sheet.""/ ""I have your regional manager on the other line"") and some authority tactics that instantly make people more likely to do what you say (such as forcing everyone to call him ""sir"" and giving Becky ultimatums whenever he had to convince her to let someone do something to her.) It seemed that the manager was able to recognize all this only after she realized it was all a farce and she learned from it. Which was an interesting way to end the movie, showing that she had learned from her experience.
After watching the movie I looked into the actual events of this particular case and I was floored to see that it's pretty much all true and even was totally caught on tape. I think the detective towards the end summed it up pretty well, but to know it was only the last in a long string of successful pranks of the same nature was just frightening. Frightening to think how weak and unquestioning people in authority are, frightening to think how few people question their commands, and frightening to think that people are still so unaware how dangerous anonymity can be.

I also read some reviews of the film and it seems after its premiere at Sundance last year it caused a shouting match during the Q&amp;A because many people found the film exploitative with simple shocks. To me, did not seem to exploit the sexual nature of the film in order to get some sort of weird sex appeal. It wasn't sexy when Becky got naked, it was an act of desperation and truly difficult to watch. The horrifying acts are framed just as that, horrifying. I don't think simply making a movie about this subject makes it shocking. Shocking, to me, is when a film uses shock material gratuitously. Like Pink Flamingos. That's a shocking movie, not only because we see a manwoman eat real dog shit and give her son a BJ, the plot was a competition to see who was the most disgusting,False,

Basically, I love learning about it when I come across information about it. I saw this documentary on the netflix instant streaming queue and thought I would give it a shot.

Coming from a point of being ignorant on the history and birth of film, as well as how early projectors used technology borrowed from a sewing machine mechanism to advance a film real one roll at a time. I learned how different movements in film were influenced by notable directors, and writers, who shaped film into the idea most average movie goers would expect to have in their minds when they go to the movie theater. I learned a lot about how early film makers learned about what shots were going to work in film and what would make for a continuous experience for the viewer. All of this has been fantastic for me, and I'm eating it right up. I loved hearing the reasons for some of the movie maker's decisions when it came to shots, and how some accidents led to innovations in style, and insights. One such insight was Alfred Hitchcock's realization that the protestant church taught him how to prove the unprovable, and by careful omission

Some things that bugged me were his insistence on making some pretty outlandish and sometimes unnecessary claims. The one that comes to mind was claiming that Hitchcock left a greater legacy for visual arts than Picasso, when I'm expecting to hear history, when instead get tossed an opinion. Its not usually something I enjoy hearing in a documentary, but I can look past it because even though they are his opinions, I enjoy hearing them. I don't often get a chance to hear educated opinions on film, so I listen and consider what he says, then move on.

The other thing is... his voice. I am totally an ignorant american, that makes it sound like everything he says is a question.

I would also like to add that sometimes he uses a few too many filler still shots of different things and to my uneducated eye sometimes looks like he is deliberately trying to show you, but it only happens every once in a while, and I can understand with 900 minutes of film that there will be rough points.

So aside from those things that don't overshadow the real heart of the content (in my opinion), showing contemporary directors harking back to references to old films, and clips from hundreds of different films. I could go into more detail about what it entails, but that's what the documentary is for.

Characters live in the movie that die in the book

It's a tough movie to examine, but then that compelling drama is undercut with attempts to please the target audience. Frollo is a wonderfully tragic and complex villain, arugably the best villian in a Disney film, but I can't imagine an 8 year old comprehending or even finding much to enjoy in a scene like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqGL9B_TPTI) where Frollo wrestles with his lust for a Gypsie woman and his conflicting racism and zealotry. ""She will be mine or she will burn,"" Frollo sings. We're a long way from Hakuna Matata, kids. It's also worth examining how Disney does a much better job with this number than in a similar ballad ""Stars"" in Tom Hooper's ""Les Miserables"", which was also based on a Victor Hugo novel. The animators and performers take full advantage of the medium to convey the character's internal struggle

Disney tries their hardest to ""kiddie"" up what is an inherently dark and depressing story, after being charmed by the heroine Esmarelda, Quasimodo's gargoyle friends sing a poppy number posing the idea that maybe he's got a shot with the girl, and that maybe she's sick of good looking guys and wants a guy like him. It's a fun song until you remember that these gargoyles are figures of his imagination and it's painfully clear that Quasimodo has ZERO chance with this girl.

Nevertheless, and I'll always consider The Lion King to be Disney's masterpiece, but there's a beautiful ambition to The Hunchback of Notre Dame that makes it worth discussing and is also why it's often overlooked or forgotten.

The music used in the movie was so well timed and always undermined the pictures

* The chorus(Monolith scene) is one of the scariest things I have heard in my entire life and made me feel extremely uncomfortable
* What I really love was, just silence, I could hear the disc spinning in it's drive.

The shots catched the scenes in a way I have seen rarely: For example when David and Frank are trying to find a hiding spot from HAL you can see HAL in the background of the cockpit window and I already knew that he was most probably trying to read their lips

What I really came here for is the ending: I was flabergasted by the precision of the effects and by the effort they must've put in to create these filters. But that's not my point...  
What is happening in the end? Is David really detached from time and space, what did he discover? What waves did the monolith emit in the first place? Was it even mentioned?

And one thing I just want to add: Every scene in the movie seems to be just 30-50% too slow/long, but over time it gives the viewer a sort of power to observe more than just what is in the focus of the camera.

Despite the ever-changing social conventions and cultural progress, cinema and television reinforcing idealistic portrayals romantic stereotypes upon audiences, over decades, even centuries, it is not surprising that many films are still subject to these codes. 

Claire Johnston discusses the use of predetermined stereotypes that have been present in a large number of Hollywood films

&gt;Panofsky locates the origins of iconography and stereotype in cinema in terms of practical necessity; he suggests that in the early cinema the audience had much difficulty deciphering what appeared on the screen. Fixed iconography


The effect of this insistence of using generic character types can still be witnessed in a large number of contemporary films – particularly when it comes to underdeveloped female roles. Perhaps the most notable issue, Laura Mulvey:

&gt;The determining male gaze projects its phantasy on to the female form which is styled accordingly. In their traditional exhibitionist role women are simultaneously looked at and displayed

There are several reasons - besides Johnston 'iconography' argument - why the male gaze so prevalent throughout the history of the romantic-comedy sub-genre, has allowed for very few alternative representations of gender, romance and family in the past** – consequently, such films are generally from a male point-of-view. Pre-existing notions of romance, identity, and the idealising of female characters, have influenced the filmmaking process ever since its inception; their solidity in media and culture is largely unaffected by unconventional viewpoints (even female-written


In a pre-feminist America, just as susceptible to the myths of 'love' as their male counterparts. Male protagonists, often idealize their female love-interests, viewing them as innocent, helpless and needing to be 'saved' (Vladimir Propp's “damsel in distress” role) from a life of potential misery; female protagonists, arguably, are still subject to a certain degree of **passiveness

Johnston notes the 'unchanging' view of females since early cinema:
&gt;As the cinema developed, etc.


In more recent years, such as first-wave feminism in the 1960s, and a subsequently-increasing Western divorce rate**, cinema reflected these changes by showing subverted values and exploring issues which had not been largely dealt with before, such as **professional independence, sexual maturity and rejection of patriarchal ideals of marriage**. The notion of 'true love' is no longer as clear-cut. 

Suddenly, who do not succeed in 'getting the girl' in the end; male protagonists could be less conventionally-attractive (Woody Allen being a seminal example), whilst it appears female characters had the freedom to choose career over family life. When feminist movements meant that females no longer had to be tied down by patriarchal ideals, their newfound freedom of sexuality and career was reflected in films of the era (notably *The Graduate*, 1968), challenging the longstanding male perspective. 

Yet, of which they are (variably) certain they will obtain; and **hints at true female independence and sexuality is met with (subconscious) emphasis on this character's villainous side, downplay of this femininity, or ironic, post-feminist leanings which romanticise an earlier, more oppressed era**. The ethos of post-feminism appears quite significant to the understanding of certain contemporary cinematic figures; Angela McRobbie defines the movement in relation to first-wave feminism:

&gt;[Through] an array of machinations


A certain type of character, seems to have arisen, particularly within the first decade of the twenty-first century: a rare, significant beacon of hope in these broken, cynical (almost-always white) protagonists' lives. This type of female representation seems inherent of a contemporary Western society, where attempts at defining either gender can no longer be applied by simple classic stereotypes; **defining the twenty-first century male is ambiguous – therefore hypothetically, a similarly-postmodern representation of the female is also needed**. 

The character in question is the **'Manic Pixie Dream Girl'** - a type of female love-interest who's main reason for existing, through 'quirky' behaviour and a child-like perspective on an otherwise disillusioned society; meanwhile, having little or no life ambitions of her own. The Manic Pixie Dream Girl is lighthearted, eccentric, and non-threatening; her (often, unintentional) behaviour inspires creativity, organisation

Numerous films, a female character who, rather than being a fleshed-out and fully-realised character, they appear to be ultimately defined by their relationship to the male lead. This essay will attempt to explore the origins, characteristics, political and social reasons why the Manic Pixie Dream Girl is so prevalent among the present-day romantic comedy genre (and whether this trend will persist in the future), with specific emphasis on one film in particular: *(500) Days of Summer* (2009), the eponymous Summer) a post-feminist figure

*(500) Days of Summer* is not a 'love story', the film deliberately attempts to set itself apart from common 'rom-com' conventions, whilst remaining in familiar enough territory from which to draw contextual conclusions. 

From the offset, one cynical – through their (lack of) exposure to these very conventions. 

A brief sequence at the beginning of the film explores the psychology behind the two leads – Tom, is convinced he will never be truly happy until he finds 'the one'; Summer, presumably affected by her parents' divorce at a young age, **rejects the typical ideals of marriage and openly voices her discomfort with being someone's girlfriend - a post-feminist mentality which is never fully explored**. Nevertheless, Tom and Summer begin to bond, and, after several weeks, even this is entirely debatable, to look back in an attempt at finding “those first signs of trouble”. 

Through these conflicting points of view, conclusion, as opposed to simply projecting unrealistic expectations, like those which have been strongly embedded in Tom's character. 

In an interview with the Examiner, 2005) and their portrayal of unrealistic scenarios:

&gt;[This] fat guy waxes his back and then dances and suddenly he’s dating a model. I just thought


In a self-aware manner, is viewed. The director plays on this idea of **shy young males, projecting idealistic characteristics onto girls like Summer**: the term, the 'Summer Effect', is introduced to describe a certain phenomenon in which young males become fixated with idealised female characters, for seemingly incomprehensible reasons. 

The film's narrator explains:
&gt;For all intents and purposes,00 offices, 91,000 commercial buildings, and 3.8 million people, well that could only be explained by one thing: fate.

The 'Summer effect' is rather implicitly at play within numerous romantic-comedies, where there is a male lead; films which appear to evoke strong feelings of 'love', or idealisation of a female character (especially where 'love at first sight', muses, and Manic Pixie Dream Girls are concerned) from which the male finds difficult to escape, are likely consequences of the 'Summer effect'. **However, this high degree of positive emphasis on one character's attributes brings with it a level of bias, realistic image of the lead characters' relationship, which puts unfair pressure on a character who does not actually appear to deserve it.

The character of Summer is exemplary of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl trope – she is considered attractive yet approachable, Rachel (Chloe Mortez), disputes “just because she likes all the same bizarro crap you do, it doesn't make her your soul mate”. **Defined by her eccentricities rather than emotional development; there is very little revealed about the potential complexity of Summer's personality, that doesn't relate directly to Tom's own experiences**. 

Sarah Seltzer elaborates on this issue
&gt;[Her] function isn't to blossom and grow as a unique individual over the course of the film. Instead, romance, or whatever else was sleeping within the male protagonist. She is the catalyst for his change or his feelings, but she inevitably doesn't have much a personality of her own underneath the endearing eccentricities.

Webb acknowledges potential feminist criticism of Summer as nothing more than a muse - who's sole intent

&gt;[It's] part of literature that has always existed. What was Beatrice to Dante? […] Eve was that to Adam. It’s just part of what [Summer] represents and I don’t think that’s a bad thing. We are often beguiled by creatures that we endow with powers that aren’t real. You expect this girl to be the answer to everything and it's not really the case.

Tom's subjectivity to the notion of Summer as a muse is all too apparent in his rejuvenated career ambitions. Through a series of triumphs and struggles, asking him to point out his favourite buildings and wondering whether he would want to make a difference to the city's skyline. All the while, Summer's ambitions are relatively unknown, with very little character development in comparison to Tom - much of her behaviour appears merely to benefit his, rather than her own, needs. **She displays strong opinions on the concept of love and marriage, desiring only a casual relationship whilst rejecting old-fashioned ideals, which is a rarely-explored alternative to romance within the sub-genre**. 

Webb, stating that, although she displays many of the typical attributes of the trope, these are deliberate misreadings put in place in order to explore the psychology behind the protagonists' 'love' (or lack thereof) for each other:

&gt;**That is one of the codes of the movie. He falls in love not with her but the idea of her […] You don’t really get to know her if it was a mature relationship

Tom's self-indulgent perspective and misunderstanding of the complexity of Summer's character, have a contextual position within world of the film – rather than male gaze for the mere sake of it, Webb's conscious decision to emphasise the eccentric and 'attractive' components of the love-interest is, arguably, part of his effort to scrutinise the modern 'love story' and to typify the tired, unrealistic representations within the romance genre as a whole.

Over the course of five hundred days, after having his heart 'broken' – with Summer, however, there is no suggestion of 'love'; despite Tom's questioning, she avoids labels and blatantly changes the subject when the 'boyfriend/girlfriend' issue is brought up. While the classic romantic-comedy (taking Chaplin's *The Circus*, for example) employs this conflict of interest in order to generate empathy and catharsis for audiences, this would typically be resolved (the hero wins over his girl, perpetuating the myth of an eternal romance (that lasts long after the conclusion of the film). In contrast



&gt;**(86)**
&gt;I think it's official. I'm in love with Summer. 
&gt;I love her smile. I love her hair. I love her knees. I love how she licks her lips before she talks. I love her heart-shaped birthmark on her neck. I love it when she sleeps.


After spending several weeks physically involved with Summer, whilst a visual montage of appropriate close-up shots accompanies him – an indisputable instance where the male gaze theory can be seen at work. In the short sequences of clips featuring Summer, the character is presented through Tom's own observations of her, as mirrored in the use of point-of-view camera work. He lists her physical attributes as reasons for 'love', rather than intellectual or professional, for instance. 

In contrast to the elevator scene on day **(4)**, visual pleasure, if only subconsciously. Does Summer hold this first, brief moment of eye-contact in similar regard? Not likely. **Mulvey argues that characters, like Tom, not only hold a position of ideologic male spectator, but represents a predominant heterosexual ego with which audiences can relate**:

&gt;According to the principles of the ruling ideology and the psychical structures that back it up

Consequently, thus adding this degree of unreliability and immaturity to his character as protagonist. In a later scene, the influence of the male ego upon the audience can be witnessed, when an identical montage of Summer's physical features appears – however, this time, a post-breakup Tom lists off things he hates about her: 

&gt;**(388)**
&gt;I hate Summer. 
&gt;I hate her crooked teeth. I hate her 1960s haircut. I hate her knobby knees. I hate her cockroach-shaped splotch on her neck. I hate the way she smacks her lips before she talks. I hate the way she sounds when she laughs.


**The audience is subject only to his thoughts and feelings, emotions and conclusions**. It also is significant to note that Tom's main source of relationship advice comes from his younger sister; though she appears wise beyond her years in terms of understanding romance, this simply reinforces Webb's notion of the immature attitude that young males, such as Tom, have towards relationships when subject to the 'Summer effect'. **The projection of this self-idealised male ego from viewer upon Tom helps reinforce the ideology of the male as the dominant, narrative force behind the film, allowing the filmmakers to manipulate their audience in order to strengthen this cinematic ego, rarely taking the time to analyse his own characteristics – he lacks the mature self-awareness needed in order (for his character) to be considered a responsible adult


Tom's occupation as a greeting card writer is perhaps the most notable scenario where Webb's attempt at deconstructing these myths and assumptions of 'love' is at its clearest. When the 'Summer effect' is in full-swing, preoccupied with depression and self-pity, Tom's return to work, distraught by the concept of 'love' that he comes to a realisation about the 'lies' that have been the basis of much popular culture throughout the decades.

&gt;**(442)**
&gt;It's these cards, that don't mean anything.

In this particular scene, the 'Summer effect' and the conventional happy ending – such filmmaking methods are no longer as relevant in a contemporary Western society. In effect, *(500) Days of Summer* provides a postmodern middle ground for the romantic-comedy, where both sides of this argument are explored in equal regard. 

However, Webb's film hints at a progressive standpoint on the view of 'love' within the sub-genre, but this is slightly undermined by his use of traditional methods such as the male gaze and general misinterpretation of Summer's character. **Conventional gender roles are still reinforced, to a degree, despite Webb's best intentions to subvert them. Much of this stems from the political, industrial and psychological factors which govern, not only Webb's filmmaking

---

Ever since its inception, for the most part, male. It is no coincidence, therefore, to see such a saturated market when it comes to the male gaze – it is simply the product of generations of male-filmmakers enforcing codes and conventions throughout repetition (thus creating easily-readable stereotypes for a broader number of audiences), with little alternative representations of gender available. With less than one-fifth of Western filmmakers being female (though increasingly *very* gradually), it may be correct to assume gender representations and filmmaking styles, are likely to persist in the foreseeable future (continually reinforcing Johnston's theory of the “eternal and unchanging” female).


What Johnston's criticism does not take into account is the amount of awareness that has come into play regarding sexism and stereotyping in cinema; in order to contextualize representations such as the Manic Pixie Dream Girl within cinematic history, such as first-wave feminism. **The Manic Pixie Dream Girl's superficial characteristics reflect a synchronous culture, but, with closer inspection, one can draw many similarities (psychological, physical and political) between this figure and previous incarnations of the literary muse over multiple generations.**  


Though Summer displays post-feminist attitudes of modern Western society, just prior to first-wave feminism. **The character resembles a number of sixties female icons, particularly Marlo Thomas in *“That Girl”* (1966-1971) and Audrey Hepburn in *Breakfast at Tiffany's* (1961), who, also defined by their quirky behaviour and unconventional attitudes towards relationships, closely mirror the contemporary Manic Pixie Dream Girl** – minus the postmodern setting and retrospective irony with which Deschanel, among others, proclaiming

&gt;Mulvey contends that the male spectator either controls the female object through fetishism, posses and suppress the female characters.

In a more traditional gender role, with a power over men that is not unlike the 'Summer effect'. Holly uses this aspect of her personality in her employment (cheering up “lonely old men” for money), without explicit reference to her sexuality; essentially a precursor to first-wave feminism, Holly (at first) appears in charge of her own independence, and rejects her neighbour, and the male protagonist, Paul's insistence that he loves her.

&gt;Paul: Holly
&gt;Holly: No

However, are simply consequential of Holly's desire to raise money for her brother, Fred – her greatest ambition being to marry a wealthy man, regardless of attractiveness, age or cultural background. Likewise, she proclaims that nothing makes her as truly happy as the feeling shopping at Tiffany's jewellery store evokes – placing particular emphasis upon capitalism in defining her happiness - arguably as superficial as Tom's reliance on 'love at first sight'. **Although it is interesting to note the largely-positive representation of a (downplayed) sexual independence, this is undermined by traditional ideologies of the female reliance on capitalism and matrimony, as key factors in defining happiness**.


Though a post-feminist ethos allows Summer to look, she winds up in a similar position to Holly, finding 'true love'. There is a very brief timespan during which Summer leaves her job, finds 'the one' and marries him. In this scenario, conventional gender representations arise: Summer goes from rejecting matrimony to finding herself in a 'loving' marriage. **There seems to be no middle ground in which for her to mature; she cannot have both**.

---

This issue relates specifically to the intriguing female roles from *The Graduate* (1967), falls into a secretive affair with Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), a housewife and long-time friend of his parents; and later, her daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross), a student with an ambiguous future. 

A sign of the times, in the late 1960s; Benjamin's household encapsulate the nuclear family (virtually the only tolerable media representation of the family unit at the time), whilst Mrs. Robinson displays newly-emerging attitudes of female sexual independence and power, but simultaneously supports a husband and daughter (both oblivious to her goings on, for the most part). Her character bears certain relevance to Janet Fink's writings on the changing values of marriage and motherhood:

&gt;[Many] significant changes to the lived experiences of women…and to the ways in which these experiences were reflected by the film industry. Undoubtedly

That being said, for instance, the framing of her figure has lenience towards the male perspective, her physical attributes suggestively filling the frame in front of an onlooking Benjamin, “stylised and fragmented by close-ups” – essentially a more explicit version of the voyeuristic montages in which Tom describes his love-interest's physical highlights. The early sequence of events between the kitchen and bedroom place specific emphasis on Mrs. Robinson's physical attributes - a highly sexualized image that portrays the independent woman as simultaneously intimidating and for the male's viewing pleasure. **Benjamin is framed suggestively through the housewife's legs, for instance, highlighting both his entrapment and his dominant gaze**; subsequently refusing to let him exit Elaine's room, “fragmented close-ups” of her unclothed breasts and thighs. 

Despite Benjamin's uneasiness in the scenario, Holly's), while an important factor of Tom's male gaze, is not referred to in such an overtly graphic manner. It appears that a majority of filmmakers (i.e. male) essentially have two options when it comes to representing female love-interests with strong feminist beliefs: **either play-down her sexuality to the point of old-fashioned innocence, or even asexuality (Summer), or have her portrayed as a sexual, formidable character (Mrs. Robinson). Neither are particularly beneficial for the portrayal of women in Hollywood cinema.**


However, who later becomes a more age-appropriate love-interest for Benjamin, embodies many struggles of the young, first-wave feminist. Elaine is, arguably, a subtle early depiction of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl; whilst she lacks notably extroverted behaviour or eccentricities, she represents similar themes of inspiration and motivation that are typical of the 'Summer effect'.

Benjamin knows her for only a brief period of time, too, feels something of a blank slate, in terms of uncertainty of her future, both romantic and professional (the ambiguous complexity of her character lost among Benjamin's subjectivity)**. Both Benjamin and Elaine represent a generation of young adults who are no longer tied down by ideological ideals such as matrimony and family, bonding through their mutual desire to do something “different” with their lives, as Benjamin proclaims in the opening scene. 

Despite this, however, displays a varied degree of opinions on the matter of marriage – she answers Benjamin's pleas with “I might”, “I'll think about it” and “I don't know” responses, as an attempt to keep her options open; she even holds another young man, Carl Smith, in a similar position. **Elaine's complex attitudes towards traditional marriage are noteworthy in relation to early feminist representations – despite her fears and precariousness, if only for a short time**. 

Nicole Smith explains:
&gt;Elaine [both] seeks to appease the status quo as set forth by her parents and suburban society while at the same time to break free and form her own understanding of herself as a woman [… Elaine], she blends these two and is the perfect immersion of the new and the traditional.

Elaine represents an ambiguous future for American females, professional young women who did not necessarily desire the traditional, patriarchal family unit as portrayed in 1950s television sitcoms. Her placement at Berkley University is also significant, due to the number of gender, and race, related movements that took place around the time around which the film is set, making her a contemporary representation of young females at the time of the film's release.

In the evolving social climate within* The Graduate*, is no longer the only acceptable option for which women to spend their lives – yet, whatever strong independent beliefs the character may hold, Elaine, Holly and Summer, manage to fulfil this old-fashioned gender role, whether through freedom of choice or not. Elaine eventually drops out of university, in order to marry Carl Smith. At the end of *The Graduate*, their spontaneous decision brings immediate regret. **Elaine may have been saved from the patriarchal


This residing message is helpful in understanding the differentiation of opinion between the two leads in* (500) Days of Summer*. Tom's misreading of the film at a young age is partly responsible for his certainty in the belief of 'the one' – through this misinterpretation it is likely that he views Summer as character worth pursuing, all the while in denial of the disparity of their romantic beliefs. 

On day **(290)**, whereas it appears Elaine cannot forge her own career trajectory or personal life without having persistent male figures attempting to shape it for her – to 'save' her**. The doubts and fears suggested in Elaine's character are similarly present within Summer after all, but Tom fails to understand, yet again – this level of miscommunication between Tom and Summer evidently carries the same undertones of immaturity and irresponsibility that is inherent in Benjamin and Elaine's 'romantic' entanglement.


Summer, after a chance meeting at a coffee shop convinces her in the very things for which she criticises Tom – 'true love', 'the one' and 'destiny'. Summer is now susceptible to the very same 'myths' and assumptions that “sad British pop songs” had once sold to Tom; conversely, the male protagonist loses faith in the one thing that he was certain would, one day, make him 'truly happy'. No longer believing this is the case, Tom is able to carve a more independent, without the worries of 'true love' residing in his mind – a position in which Summer


In the final scene of the film **(500)**, with whom he is competing for an illustrious job. They talk briefly prior to their job interview and make plans for coffee, bonding over their shared passion for their potential careers in the same way Summer and he once did with *The Smiths*. When Tom discovers the girl's name, a tongue-in-cheek nod at the camera implies that Autumn may restore his belief in 'true love' after all, with the days counter returning to **(1)**. The name 'Autumn' implies an emotional progression from his relationship with Summer - Tom has finally developed into a professional, mature human being; in relation to numerous films, Howard Suber defines this balance of love and work as the sign of true maturity:

&gt;**Sigmund Freud wrote that the most important requirements for maturity were the ability to love and the ability to work. In an astonishing number of the most popular films, and the lesson that he or she frequently learns […] is how to do both.**

It is fairly common that characters, but neglect work (e.g. Summer, Elaine, Benjamin), or vice versa (McKenzie) – those who represent this sense of maturity (Mrs. Robinson and, to an extent, Holly) are often met with intimidated or innocent representations.

However, both male and female characters are, simultaneously, applying for the same position – evincing a contemporary scenario in which **both genders have equal skills and opportunities – and are able to occupy themselves with pursuing a love-interest, in spite of said career prospects**. This is not to say Autumn herself wouldn't fall under a post-Manic Pixie Dream Girl banner, but it is, presumably

However ambiguous these films may seem in regards to feminism – several instances, progressive representations of females in contrast to the traditional values of the nuclear family – the fact remains that, a certain degree of male bias (and in some cases, misogyny) is going to arise so long as the filmmakers are, for the most part, male.

1374938674.0,1j5vsy,Cube (1997),wheresmycokehoney,94,17,19,"I’ll preface this by saying I don’t claim to know a lot about movies or even to have seen a great deal of them. I just thought it would be fun to talk about this movie. Feel free to criticize my analysis and I will try to improve my writing in the future. I would also like to add that I haven’t seen the sequel or prequel to this movie yet so if you all wouldn’t mind keeping the discussion free of spoilers for “Cube 2” and “Cube: Zero


I came across this movie in a “best science fiction movies” list. Before watching the movie I did not think that it sounded like a science fiction movie at all. Afterwards I would maintain that it does not qualify as “sci-fi” even though “horror” and “sci-fi” are not mutually exclusive. I wouldn’t say that this is a science fiction movie unless you would also qualify a movie like “The Human Centipede” as science fiction as well,” about torture committed by humans against other humans, but I don’t see the cube device itself or the fact that math is used as sufficient reasons to call it a science fiction movie. At any rate, whether “Cube” is a science fiction movie or not is one topic we could discuss here.


Returning to the subject of torture, rather than to scare or disgust the audience. Considering that the theme of the movie is that humans are capable of an infinite amount of stupidity, it is fitting that the victims’ real enemy is one of their own. One thing I do have to say about Quentin is that the character and actor who played him could have been more subtle. It broke my suspension of disbelief a bit to see him acting so insane when other characters seemed to be unaffected by the effects of stir craziness or even acting more rationally than at the beginning of the movie. It’s a bit hard to swallow that a cop, or one who claims to be a cop, would act in such a way simply because he is being criticized by others.


Though the central theme of human stupidity is one I don’t disagree with, instead of doing the completely logical and natural thing and hightailing it out of there, he decides to hit us over the head with the message of “endless human stupidity” once again. The fact that his moralizing inadvertently causes his death and the death of Leaven could be potentially infuriating for an audience member. However, I don’t think it’s that big of a deal since the writers probably would have found a way to end the movie the way they did in one way or the other. Kazan, a recycled version of “The Rain Man,” is the only one who escapes. He is the only innocent among the group since “contributing” members of society merely contribute to making the world a terrible place.


One question I have is


After writing all this, especially considering its budget, and does a great job of leading the audience by their nose and creating suspense. It’s also nice to have a movie based on more concrete principles like mathematics, even if the only parts of it I can understand are “square root” and “prime numbers.” Too many horror movies rely too heavily on supernatural elements that aren’t fully explained, if explained at all. This movie seems to follow a certain amount of logic consistently. It can be nitpicked to death and I can definitely understand someone not liking it. I feel, however, that the film as a whole adds up to more than the sum of its imperfect parts.

After watching 'This is 40' I honestly can't disagree

Its not even limited to just the primary couple, which leads to financial difficulties for Rudd. Whilst you might not agree with Rudd supporting his father it seems to be coming from a good place and how you respond to Mann's reaction might depend somewhat on what you would do if placed in a similar situation. Even a minor character like Lena Dunham's, who delivers only a couple of lines manages to squeeze in a snide remark at Chris O'Dowd's sexual inadequacies. Then theres Melissa Mcarthy's shrieking overly-protective mother, but even her behaviour is motivated by Mann verbally assaulting her child, although that whole sequence certainly makes us root for Mann to a point.

Megan Fox's character and Jody, though initially suspected of being a thief is actually a prostitute and Jody, a strange but apparently hardworking employee is actually a drug addict. Fox is also easily captivated and seduced by the loveable Apatow-regular Jason Segal. Judd Apatow said that if you cast Paul Rudd in your movie, you can get away with anything, which leads me to believe that whether or not Apatow genuinely means to be sexist,his casting choices perhaps inadvertently present women unflatteringly in contrast.

What immediately sets the film apart is its straight linear narrative and triptych structure, but a unified trinity.

Through these three acts, described the possibility of seeing nature as ""some enormous, implacable, and dumb beast...some huge engine of the latest design...a dark, insolent, and senselessly eternal power, to which everything is subordinated."" This perfectly captures the world of The Place Beyond the Pines; the characters ultimately appear helpless, implacable

But there's more to it. Cianfrance also captures what he calls the ""eternity of every moment."" With long, with certain dispositions, free to choose one way or another. So we're caught between two impressions of this place beyond the pines: either the fate of the characters is fixed - actions linked to other actions, people to other people, in a rigid, machine-like way - or it's the result of the chaotic skubala of human desires, of human freedom. Or, it's both.

But all of this doesn't have to be as disturbing as The Place Beyond the Pines is, honor, dignity, strength, courage, conviction, tradition, purpose - passed from fathers to sons, I think maybe it's both. Maybe both is happening at the same time."")

1359706431.0,17oojj,Director trademarks. What are they? Why are they used? Are they important to a film? And do you know of any lesser known or obscure trademarks?,,94,19,94,"I guess we should start this by defining a director trademark. I would say a director trademark is something (a name, a specific shot, a common cast

But sometimes a director's trademark can be something much more subtle and difficult to spot. While it is very popular (and I'm sure most of you are already familiar with it), but what about the trunk shot? Even when there is no car available he manages to use to (the end of Inglourious Basterds for example). But why does he use this shot over and over again? Well, perhaps he simply thinks it's cool. Perhaps he once saw it in a movie and wanted to use it. Maybe he's not sure of another coherent way to show what's going on in those situations.

So, and I like that. Michael Haneke uses the names Geroge / Anne is, I think, every single movie he's done. Normally the main characters, but when there are lots of characters he simply makes sure one of them is named George and one is named Anne. This goes far beyond simply sticking to a similar style and having the inevitability that something will come up frequently. It's a deliberate choice he makes. And that idea that some directors make a very deliberate choice to include something that doesn't really add anything to their films, is exactly what I want to focus on. I want to know if anybody here has picked up on anything that isn't on IMDB, that isn't already discussed on Reddit, and hopefully you'll find it at least entertaining.

Joel and Ethan Coen are two of the greatest filmmakers out there. I could go on and on about them, for a *long* time. There is simply a ton of content in their films. When it comes to trademarks they are no different. They typically have plots consisting of misunderstandings, they use money as a plot device, they film things spinning (they film round things a lot too), they *love* to film people screaming, they use the same actors, they use the same DOP (which leads to similar photography), to some extent, what is it exactly that I've noticed?

The Coen brothers fucking love shoes. At first, you see. But I started noticing that it's more than just a low angle. It's a constant effort to *include* people's feet and shoes in a shot that is often achieved in a different way by most other film makers. Sometimes it's not even shoes being worn, it's simply shoes. Other times, it's something involving shoes or feet. It's strange.

You may be saying to yourself that it's just one of those things, Intolerably Cruelty (because I don't own that movie), and The Ladykillers (because I don't own that one either, but I remember thinking about my shoe theory the last time I saw it so I know it applies, I just don't have any screen shots to show you).

So check it out. And be warned that some of these images may spoil parts of the movie for you. So I advise you to simply not look through the film's album if you haven't seen it just to be on the safe side.

I saw it mainly as a cautionary tale about letting the established order around you remain unchallenged, whatever society or way of life to which one might become indoctrinated, and a demonstration of the complete and utter absurdity (and ultimate futility) of trying to control the kind of information one receives by shutting out exterior influences. 

I thought of the Carl Jung quote: ""The achievements which society rewards are won at the cost of diminution of personality"". The father in the film has created a small ""utopia"" for his children to protect them from the harmful outside world. His is a meritocratic society that rewards achievement, down to their fundamental understanding of linguistics and denotation. I could almost imagine the father justifying all of this to himself when they were first born, when he was still psychotic but maybe more idealistic, and over the years it just devolved into farcical insanity. Then again how you would justify something like this in the first place is beyond me.

Even if it's a film that's more concerned with its concept and themes than it is about character or narrative, that was tragic, and the notion that because her fundamental understanding of the world has been so totally molded and mutilated by the father, when her anarchic instincts (or her innate drive for self-actualization) kick in and she finally makes to escape, she can only do so on his terms and her attempt is futile (assuming she died in the trunk).

I also really admired the way the film was constructed, hilarious and really unsettling.

I'm still a little baffled by certain things though. Like the significance of the father's factory

1364926493.0,1bj3d3,First watch of 'Requiem for a Dream' (2000). My thoughts.,ben_smith_123,102,29,49,"Bleak portrait of drug abuse and addiction from Darren Aronofsky, she finds solace in grotesque TV infomercials hosted by repugnant Tappy Tibbons (Christopher McDonald) in the manner of an evangelical preacher. Her aimless life is rejuvenated upon receiving a call that she’s been selected to appear on television

The film unflinchingly depicts helplessness and dependency, while they remain fixated on their hopes and goals, drugs are tearing them apart. Although drug abuse is shown in the most negative of lights, it isn’t moralised about – there is no good and evil, just unfortunate souls consumed by their own sickness. It’s this ambiguity that makes ‘Requiem’ so effective. The crippling effect of addiction is apparent but it raises countless questions that it invites the viewer to analyse. The theme of dependency on a substance, but also friends and family is raised throughout – so even if the concept of drug abuse is far removed from our own lives the reliance on others will resonate with everyone. Indeed Sara’s core struggle is no longer feeling needed – “Your father's gone, you're gone. I got no one to care for. What have I got

This is a spellbinding piece of filmmaking with exceptional performances from all the cast – Ellen Burstyn in particular is remarkable as the vulnerable Sara - as well as frequently inventive cinematography and camera techniques that were groundbreaking on its release in 2000. Unfortunately the quick close up cuts of drug preparation and dilating pupils, but as the film’s language has now passed into pop culture, its visual impact has been severely blunted. The same can be said for the music, a wonderful dark minimal score by Clint Mansell that sweeps over the jarring tactile images beautifully – but has since been repurposed as the theme for Sky Sports News (amongst others), creating an irritating distraction for any UK sports fans, especially as the main theme ‘Lux Antenna’ is such a prominent part of the film itself.

As with all Aronofsky’s work it engages physically as well as emotionally. He’s created a terrifying, this is an exceptional piece of cinema.

We rarely see a well crafted film directed from (not towards) African-American culture though. While I doubt this is the start of a trend it was interesting to see it done right for once.

My favorite example of this was the hype surrounding *Inception*.  People were raving that it was a challenging film. But I don't think that is the case. It is a film that demands attention the first time around because of the rules of dreams. After seeing the film once

A film like *Mulholland Dr.* is both a complex and intricate film. David Lynch's clues to unlocking the film reveal that the intricacies are merely a way of keeping the audience engaged

Shane Carruth's second film *Upstream Color* is complex. There are no formal rules as to why things happen. They just do and the audience understands more as the film progresses and has to keep up on their own.

Can the disparity merely be the difference of being independent films or studio made? Or does it come down to the directors being at fault for deciding what level to engage and challenge the audience? For the record

When his career is all said and done, he will be, along with those two, among a revered pantheon of filmmakers, ones who challenge cinematic conventions and create something that reminds us of why we watch movies.

The dialogue, is at its strongest out of the three movies, and takes the characters through all parts of their intellect and emotions, and always keeps you rights with the characters. It's realistic, hilarious, heartbreaking, and most importantly

It's been mentioned on this subreddit before that this film explores the conflict between the rational and the irrational, I love the character, but I'm still conflicted about his true intentions and purpose.

At first, eventually fighting some kind of demonic inner compulsion. Stranglove's final declaration after standing; while memorable, left me puzzled as well. For me, Strangelove ended up being a goofball quack of some kind. Though I could once again have the wrong impression.

One other item that bothers me is one of my favorite shots in the film: After the wing is recalled and the war room begins to celebrate, that scene scares the shit out of me. In any case, I'm confused by this shot. This shot (for me) indicates that Strangelove knows a lot more than anyone else in the room. He's as rational as can be. He knows much better than to celebrate. It's such a powerful shot. But then... soon after... we watch Strangelove disintegrate completely. I'm left believing he's just another nutty character in the bunch.

This was an absolute masterpiece and it was a film that hit very close to home for me. I found this film fascinating for a number of reasons:

-The most obvious is Jack Lemmon's and Shirley McClane's performances. Both were incredible and captivating. Wonderfully engaging actors whose screen presence is overwhelming

-I found it incredible that Billy Wilder was able to so blatantly and clearly deal with the subject of infidelity during the Hollywood Production code. Not to mention suicide and depression. Billy Wilder is dealing with some very heavy themes here.

-I think Billy Wilder's take on the ""Beta man loves girl out of his league"" was probably one of the best ones I've ever seen.


I thought what was really great about the film was that the character Baxter was a very imperfect character other than being someone who comes off too strong and awkward. His desire to be seen as a ladies man destroys his reputation with his neighbors who he allows to see him as a reckless and constant partier. Furthermore, he tries to distract her with a game of gin/rummy. Some may see this as him trying to keep her mind of her troubles but at the same time what Kubelik really needs is for someone to tell her to get out of the relationship.

The end of the film was rather bitter/sweet. C.C. confesses his love for Fran but she says the famous line ""Shut up and deal"". This clues into a Catch-22. Fran likes C.C. because he doesn't think of her in purely sexual way and is attracted to her as a person

Ok, and so many nods to the original, with so many homages to the traditional themes within horror movies that I am gushing. **Firstly**, the gore. Goddamn was it brutal, raw, and unyeilding. No holding back on this mothafucka, that's for sure. It didn’t flinch from making you watch the most unsettling scenes


The **editing** deserves a mention here, mixing it up with abundant style. Specific nods go the knife on the knee, Eric's many new orifices, tongue+box-cutter, the limbs, the crowbar and his longtime girlfriend, and seeing the flesh crisp away from hick girl's skin. Probably one of the most disturbingly brutal gore-flicks I’ve seen, if I had to choose two. 

---

The **acting** was exactly where it needed to be. Conveying fear and emotion through faces and whimpering was on display by everyone who had to do it well; specifically Mia outshining everyone. I assume it was also her (Jane Levy) in the demonic scenes, demonic, terrorizing, malicious, redemptive, and then finally to surviving. Truly a great horror genre actor, Ms. Levy. 



Everyone else fulfilled their actions well, laughter is the only defense against the discomfort one feels when one sees a victim pull a hypodermic syringe from his eye. Pretty interesting situations, all horrific throughout, all capitalizing on the “demonic”, “evil” thematics. 

It followed the pentagon of Slut (in this case the girlfriend, athlete, etc), Intellectual (nurse/rationalizer), Moron (come on dude, put that book down), and Virgin or Final Girl. The things this movie does with the final girl are pretty spectacular

---

And while I don’t necessarily want to label the **ending** as a “twist”, feeling like a huge reward for enduring the horrors of the film. I struggle to call any horror movie “excessive”, but that was like a 10 seconds of showcasing the *moment*; it was a straight up statement, and I loved it. 

The **plot setup** of the drug detox was seamless, man. Such empathizing for the characters made my mood bipolar, waxing and waning whenever that fucking demon saw fit to try and test a character’s willpower and resolve. The lines of dialogue “why does my face hurt” and “I just wanna go home” combined with the minimizing of classic horror movie “fuck-ups” made the whole situation really hit home. Empathy overload, almost.

That’s another huge bonus. The movie **minimizes stupidity** by plot conventions and characters that aren’t clumsy as hell just for shits and giggles. My suspension of disbelief rested easy with Evil Dead because everything made logical sense, it made for a truly enjoyable experience, if you know exactly what kind of movie this is – one that doesn't ever let up. 

---

I think one truly horrifying thing about the Evil Dead having demonic roots is that as an audience, after posting a pic to Facebook trying to lick the nipple part of the skin on the book. 

But because there is that possibility that our superstitions or our rituals have some basis in reality, for just a second, our own belief system and make us act upon it, it’s a success in more ways than one. The fact that this movie celebrates malice and what could only really be described as EVIL is an individuals’ choice to value or not. I leave to you. 

---

**Grievances: (spoilers

From one viewing

The Moron, if not suffocation by drowning? Should that not work similarly to being buried alive? This wasn’t clear but I don’t think it matters too much, as Eric came back to spook the shit out of us. 


The Slut, so I didn’t think it was a stretch to say she died, limbless and like lumber. However, it would have been nice to see David put her out of her misery (it may have been uncharacteristic though). Perhaps she simply burned in the fire, which made sense too. 


The one who arises, was presented amazingly)? If so, we are to assume that that one who rises is the last to be exorcised? Or was it another female? I didn’t care in the moment, because there was too much awesome happening before my eyes, but I am curious about explanations. I almost kinda wish it was Campbell coming back, but that would have been too cool for even me to handle, and I would have sliced my face off in the theater right then and there. 

As far as traditions within horror films go, and is symbolized as one of our primal instincts/needs, almost in a Freudian way. Many horror films expresses these ideas, and sex is often a huge one. There were no bosoms, boobs, or bodacious breasts in this film. Totally forgivable, but lets face it, especially within a horror flick. There's also much consideration for their absence

Personally, exists under the pretense that it is ""more immersive"". I find that a shallow depth of field within the context of a two dimensional projection assists the illusion of depth or three dimensionality but within the context of a ""3D"" projection limits the viewers' eyes' ability to roam about the frame. If I decide to look anywhere other than the subject my brain begins to hurt because everything else is out of focus. The same is true of a fast cut. I feel I would like to experience each shot for longer in order to ""live in"" it and since I have a desire to let my eye wander about the frame I'm less likely to be looking where the editor wants me to at the moment of a cut causing me a lot disorientation. 

I think that a return to a more Bazinian style of filmmaking would greatly improve 3D films. With a larger depth of field and longer takes the viewer would be able to look around the frame at will and really immerse themselves in the world that the filmmaker is trying to create.

Does it go without saying that there will be spoilers?

I saw Skyfall on opening weekend, the fact that a ""bondgirl"" was shoehorned in for all of 15 minutes before she took a bullet to the head, yet somehow she's still supposed to be significant enough to make it onto the damn DVD cover?? *sigh*....the other thing that made me audibly scoff in the theater is the fact that Q, the super-awesome-fantastic-masterful-computer genius who **states explicitly** that they're dealing with a madman who's *also* a super-awesome-fantastic-masterful-computer genius, and yet he STILL decides to plug this villains computer into the MI6 mainframe?  Really?  I admit that I'm NOT a computer genius (unless taking a semester of C+ in undergrad counts), but even I knew that plugging an alien computer into the entire basis of your operation is a bad idea.  Lastly, the whole M dying at the end with Ralph Feinnes taking her place just seemed a bit contrived, and I really didn't feel a whole lot at the moments when the film was trying it's hardest to make me feel bad.

I know there are quite a few people who like this movie (you don't break a billion dollar box office income easily), The intro song and opening was pretty cool.  Yes, there was a pretty strong set of actors.  At this point, however, I have no desire to see the movie ever again, not because it was reprehensible, but because I was bored watching it.

Fast forward ten years a coworker yells at me ""YO SAL(my name)! WHY AIN'T THERE NO BROTHERS ON THE WALL?!"" I am confused at this point but he tells me about the movie

I see the movie as this: 

* Buggin' Out is just trouble. He goes to someones restaurant and says the foods too overpriced and needs more cheese but he's wearing $100 pair of shoes. When Sal says ""Go somewhere else"" he says forget it and then complains that in an Italian American restaurant

* Sal bought the restaurant when it was mostly white but didn't move when it turned black. It didn't matter to him, he said it was the best sales ever and that He is changing the name from ""Sal's Famous Pizzeria"" to Sal and Son's Famous"". He also included that despite how shitty Mookie works, he is **family** . 

* Mookie has a child and is working, takes a shower and changes, visits his child's mother. He yells at his boss. Sal has a crush on his sister, a very beautiful Young black woman, who he makes special food for (which further proves that Sal is not a Racist) and Mookie tells her to stay away. Just to stay away.

*  Radio Raheem is a trouble maker who just walks around causing confrontation with everyone. His radio he doesn't turn off is playing ""Fight The Power"" by Public Enemy. When he goes to the store for batteries for his boombox, When Sal gets mad and calls it Nigger music he flips shit and the police get called. In an act of Police Brutality, He is choked and killed after resisting arrest. Nothing not wrong about that. 

This cause a riot in the neighborhood. They corner the father and sons and yell say that it is not his fault. Some member of the community try to settle it down, it still burns. The next day Sal is sitting infront of his burned shoppe and Mookie gets up and asks him for his weekly check. Understandable? the man just had his entire life burned down and the guy who started it is asking him for $200? Sal gives him $250 but mookie says he doesnt want his money and throws it back. After a minute of looking at it on the ground where he threw it, he picks it up and walks away. Thats it. Thats the End.

1375228685.0,1jdwl5,Do large critical reappraisals still happen?,Taikomochi,76,9,44,"This is a question I have wondered about a lot lately.

Cinema is filled with huge reappraisals

I'm thinking of films like Vertigo, which was not popular in America until 20 years after its initial release and 9 years after the death of its director.  And now they're regarded as some of the best films ever made.  If I recall correctly, Keaton's The General was received poorly both by audiences and critics, yet it is also regarded as one of the best films ever made.

But I feel like I haven't really experienced that in my lifetime.  Maybe it's just my perspective being warped by only reading about these occurrences and not experiencing them, were a happening time for old classics getting dug up and becoming beloved.  I read about how Hitchcock and Ozu got national releases, and feel like I just don't see that anymore.

Still, that are becoming more regarded as classics, if slowly.

I have to wonder with the way the internet works, somebody would see these films and talk about them.

So my questions are these:  Do these reappraisals still happen?  Is it just that they take more time than I realize to occur?  What films nowadays are being reappraised(like A.I.)?  What are some films that you expect could be reappraised(I know this is like listing, I still feel it will generate discussion)?

edit: Another question might be are there instances when films are instantly regarded as classics but later reappraised to be not as good?

And how does this affect the overall cinema landscape?",neodiogenes,81,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1hqfyx/with_advances_in_cgi_what_types_of_films_are_now/, CGI finally can accurately express a director's vision without breaking the fourth wall.  

Back when I was a kid, with full shields and fancy maneuvers -- which at the time was technically possible, but not financially prudent.  Of course, that came along soon after in the TV series, and since has shown up many times -- but never without some visual artifact that made it clear I was still watching a movie.

With *Superman II* (1980) we finally got somewhat dramatic battles between super-powered characters -- but again, such as Sam Raimi's *Spiderman* (2002) or better Catwoman (2004) had laughably awful motion capture CGI that did little to sell the film visually.

But then you have films like *The Avengers* which was pretty well visually perfect.  I don't think it would have been possible without some of the advances that came from James Cameron's *Avatar* (2009) -- which undoubtedly had its flaws, again without ruining the illusion.

That being said, but perhaps not as easy.  I'm also probably not giving LucasFilm enough credit, certainly with the ability to create visually dense yet totally computer-generated scenes.

Still, and so the cost has and will continue to come down, at least without any more innovations. 

But to get to the point: with the advent of truly realistic CGI

So, affect the cinematic landscape in terms of what movies producers will now attempt?  Will this create additional emphasis on spectacle for its own sake (e.g. the *Transformers* movies, or possibly the upcoming *Pacific Rim*) or will this give directors freedom to push the visual envelope?  

And how will this change the film narrative overall

[Edit]  I deliberately exclude animated films from this list (which includes completely CGI animation that is still meant to look like animation, I'm sold.

[Here is the discussion in /r/dataisbeautiful]( http://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1hn1l3/ten_graphics_on_the_bechdel_test_oc/)

I wrote in /r/dataisbeautiful about the test and my motivation to do the charts:

&gt; Bechdel test was enunciated by Alison Bechdel on the comic Dykes to Watch Out For in 1985. A movie to pass the test must meet the following prerequisites:

&gt; 1. It has to have at least two women in it

&gt; 2. who talk to each other

&gt; 3. about something besides a man.

&gt; The most widely form of the test used today added the necessity of the two female characters have names. The test has the characteristic of being simple, a limitation of it is that the application to a single movie is debatable, since there can be many artistic choices that end up making the movie not pass the test (for example, Run Lola Run don't have two female characters who talk to each other). Thus its application is more interesting when applied to a set of films, since it may reveal patterns of how women are represented consistently in this group. The graphs present here subdivide the films into groups according to variables available on sites to try to find how each category affects the way females characters are represented.

I would like to hear a discussion about it here, have some information that can lead to good discussion about the test itself and, depending how you see it, about how the movies industry represent women. These are some questions that I have (fell free to propose and discuss other aspects, I'm just trying to give something to start the conversation):

1. It's ok to evaluate a director

2. We had a recent period (60's to the 80's) that had greater tendency to increase women role in movies than now. Why this stop? 

3. The gender of the directors



As I said in my post I have little academic knowledge in movies. I'm a biologist who deals with data and when I heard about the test I decided to make these charts.

I would like to highlight  one thing about the charts:

It seems that Bechdel Test [measures very well if female characters talk quite as much as male character]( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7XSm1mkVyMw/UdV6lJPlZfI/AAAAAAAAG50/CTMjWU0-d-Y/s1600/SP_BECH_EACH.png)

I’m not going to bother explaining the plot of the film just its themes

Additionally please keep in mind that I haven’t read the book and books and movies are different just because a book wanted to portray something doesn’t mean the film’s director followed or even wanted to follow a purists vision that comes from the author. Nolan didn’t even use the same ending for the Prestige and Kubrick did the same for A Clockwork Orange two phenomenal films.

Also keep in mind this is my analysis




I personally think this movie should have won Best Picture. For several reasons really to me the only true competition was Lincoln and after the Academy Awards I made an opposition thread talking about the politics of the awards this year. [That thread is here if you are interested](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/197c8o/2013_oscars_opposition_mostly_to_best_picture/)


This really isn’t going to be an analysis as much as it is my viewpoint on questions about the movie. Questions that I had people ask me and common questions about objects and meaning throughout the film that I don’t think most people would understand or noticed.

Again if you haven’t seen this movie spoilers are below so go see this beautiful movie then come back.

**Common questions**

What does the island represent?

The island Pi finds in the ocean. The first thing to notice about this island is that when viewed from afar the island is the shape of a man lying down. So what does this mean, but at night the island is carnivorous and Pi realizes that while this island gives me everything I need eventually it will devour me. This is because the island only has what is physically sustaining for men. 

Now there are two things to point out that happen at night. 

1.	He finds a Lotus Flow at night time in the tree branches
2.	He finds a tooth hidden within the lotus flower

**What do these two things mean

**The Lotus Flower** – “What did you mean? The God of Love is hiding in the forest?” remember that line in the film? Pi approaches the girl of his dreams and asks her about the interpretation of her dancing and why she made a certain hand symbol about love. He asks her was she trying to say “that the god of love is hiding in the forest” she offers no response but says the hand symbol can also mean “lotus flower”. Now later when Pi finds the island he sees a Lotus Flower in a place where it shouldn’t be. Up in the trees of the forest and when he grabs it and opens it he finds a human tooth inside and realizes the island is “carnivorous”. The lotus flower represents love

So my interpretation is that the Lotus Flower is showing him the lies of the island. First of all he finds the flower in an unnatural place to find the lotus flower they are located at the bottom of rivers not up in trees, good health and purity. But he realizes that the island devoured a man before him and that this place was a lie and would devour him too. 

So what does this mean I took it like this

But at night time in isolation, staying on the island is the act of a person who would be apathetic toward living. Which is not how Pi believes he should live his life so he leaves, the unnatural lotus flower represent the lies of love that the island wants him to believe so that he will stay and be devoured. The tooth represents two things the island devouring the man on the island, but as we later find out it also represents that Pi may be a cannibal and his story may be false.

Side note: Although isolation isn’t necessarily a bad thing in life, it’s often used as a tool to explain the human psyche, it has more to do with a disassociation with other human emotions than actually being isolated. See for instance characters such as: Daniel Plainview, Roger Chillingsworth, Gollum, in fact even Ahab mirrors this flaw which leads to his downfall.

Therefore the island acts as a sort of test in life to moving forward

**Were the events true or not?**

At the end of the movie Pi has to tell his story as a survivor of the shipwreck to the company that owned the ship

This is wholly up to the audience to decide. There are facts and interpretations to support both. However I have a problem with his realistic factual story

*“No one has ever seen that floating island since; you won’t read about those trees in any nature book. And yet if I hadn’t found those shores, alone forever”*, 

This is very true

**But, he tells it with a lot of passion and tears so you could take that as being the emotional trauma of having to tell the true story, (but you could also take that point for the other side as well). The next clue is the tigers name. Way back in the day Edgar Allen Poe wrote a story about a cabin boy named Richard Parker. What happens in the story is that a few men and the cabin boy get stranded on the open ocean after a ship wreck and the men eat the cabin boy to stay alive. The eerie part about this is that some years later a ship actually did shipwreck on the open ocean and several men were stranded, these men killed and ate one of the other men to stay alive, the man who was killed, his name was Richard Parker. Therefore we can say the tiger’s name is a clue to the truth of the story as well.


Now for what I believe is the most difficult question for people

**What does the tiger represent?**

**The reflection in the eyes** –  Pi’s Father reprimands him for getting too close to the Tiger

These statements are largely my belief for what the tiger represents. He represents the whole mysteriousness of god and life vs. nature. Similar to Melville’s Moby Dick

The tiger is a representation of nature, he doesn’t see a cold lifeless world he sees God starring back at him. Pi sees the beauty of life, and even though God makes no call to him and says nothing to him he still believes in him, and that it was God who saved his life. 


*Even when God seemed to have abandoned me, he gave me rest, then gave me a sign to continue my journey.*

Pi continues on nothing but the faith to be rescued or find land.

Similarly if Pi is the Tiger like he says at the end the themes simply go without God and like he said the tiger represents both his will to survive and the way that cruel circumstances will bring out the evil nature of men

**So

*At the edge of the jungle, growl – that he’d bring our relationship to an end in some way. But he just stared ahead into the jungle.*

*And then Richard Parker, disappeared forever from my life. After a few hours, a member of my own species found me. He left and returned with a group who carried me away.*

*I wept like a child, I felt it. Even if I can't prove it...*

*You know

*You know, Anandi, India – I suppose in the end the whole of life becomes an act of letting go. But what always hurts the most is not taking the moment to say goodbye. I was never able to thank my father for all I learned from him, to tell him that without his lessons I would never have survived… And I know he’s a tiger, but I wish I’d said: It’s over. We’ve survived. Thank you for saving my life. I love you, Richard Parker. You will always be with me. May God be with you.*

**I’ll explain this by paragraph:**

1.	The young Pi at this moment in his life wants a cathartic experience with his friend Richard Parker the tiger. The tiger as a representation of nature and god he wants to know it has a soul a physical determining fact that it will turn around and say yes your right

2.	He refers to Parker as the terrible one that kept him alive even though he says it with compassion


3.	He explains that the letting go of his companion was heart breaking. He metaphorically says that he still believes in God despite the lack of acknowledgement from God.

4.	He acknowledges his father’s hard lessons of using reason but that he still felt the touch of God in the animal.


5.	The culmination of the lessons his teachers had on his spirituality and thoughts on life. Between his Father, but he wishes he could have said it to them, and that even though they are gone they are still with him in his heart and mind because he has accepted those lessons as a part of himself. Then he just says I love you and blesses them.


**SIDE ANALYSIS**

**Pi’s Father** - Pi’s father is an intellectual man he represents progression in India thus his desire to be a successful business man who has the only Zoo. He clearly loves his family deeply, he is a very good person who tried to teach Pi about nature, Pi thinks him a sort of mean person because Pi has the naivety of a young person to not realize that harshness can be seen as love too. That is why he is so tough on the young Pi and makes him watch the tiger kill an animal and tell him that the tiger has nothing in his eyes. Not because he wants to deprive his son of a friend but because he wants his son to live and realize that nature is harsh whether you believe in God or not and that if he wants to survive he needs to understand this.

**The bioluminescent whale**– This scene is a homage to **Moby Dick – Spoilers Ahead** In fact when Ahab dies in the book he is on a small boat just like Pi that gets crushed by the whale and he is dragged into the sea after harpooning the white whale, it’s almost the exact same picture.

For reference:

[Moby Dick there are tons of these and this isn’t the exact picture I was referring to

Originally aired for Polish television in the late 80s this ten part series of one hour films are some of the most original and thoughtful films ever made. Loosely based on the 10 commandments each film represents one of them well at best ambiguously. The stories are dramatic events surrounding the characters lives and the impacts by their choices and actions in regard to each commandment. The characters live in the same Warsaw apartment rise and interact with each other whether its just walking by or waiting in the elevator with each other. There is a on looker

The first thing that I found striking about the film is it's marvellous camera-work, along with the very rich soundtrack made the film's other features (such as the peoples' thoughts and the lack of narrative) work, where in any other film those same features may not slide.

The second thing I found impressive was it's use of colour, colour could represent the way the angels *think* humans see the world – when in reality, they too could only see the world in monochrome - this would show the angels' sense of superiority/power (although this theory probably holds no weight considering one of the angels humanises himself, and proceeds to see in colour)

While I personally enjoyed the film I could see why one would not, as I feel there is so much more to it than one could possibly grasp on a first-viewing. This was my second Wim Wenders film (my first being “Paris, Texas” which I also thoroughly enjoyed), and I look forward to further exploring his filmography.

However, and which seems both intelligent and honest to the characters in the story. It's the whole point of the movie, in fact, and it's even reflected in the title - ""blood simple,"" or a state of mind defined by reduced judgment as a result of exposure to sudden violence. I'll be spoiling key elements of the film, obviously, but this won't really make much sense if you haven't seen the movie

The basic synopsis is that a man (Marty) has hired a private investigator (Visser) to kill his wife (Abby) and her lover, doctors photos of the two of them dead, then kills Marty, the only witness, after collecting his payment. Ray later stumbles onto the crime scene and, shellshocked, buries Marty in a farmer's field

From this point on, unaware that the (now-dead) Marty was merely trying to pin the loss of the $10,000 paid to the private investigator on him. Abby legitimately has no idea what's going on, as neither her nor Ray even know that Visser exists.

Through some combination of being absolutely shellshocked and rightly accepting the most logical explanation for what they're seeing and hearing, Marty!"" Finally piecing things together, and struck by the sheer irony of the situation, Visser bursts into uncontrollable laughter, responding: ""Well, ma'am, if I see him

What I really like about this film is its subversion of a worn-out trope in a legitimate way; while each character's behavior might seem unbearably foolish while it's happening, confusing things they're going through, their legitimate application of Occam's Razor in coming to the most logical explanation, and the magnitude of the information that is missing to the characters (if either Ray or Abby knew about Visser and hadn't told the other, the lack of communication would have felt contrived rather than understandable due to fear and suspicion). All in all I'm a little humbled, as I'd already written off films which use the idiot plot and now have to consider that in certain limited cases it may serve a legitimate purpose. I'd like to use this thread both as a discussion of the film and as a springboard for conversation about other worn-out tropes that have been used in fresh and worthwhile ways in individual films.",,,,

This is my favorite crime/gangster film of all time.  It features great performances from the entire cast -- Sean Penn is perhaps more physically transformed than ever, and perhaps it's just his physical features, but he brings some Lucifer-like qualities to the role.  Luis Guzmán as a fickle henchman.  Pachino's great, Penelope Ann Miller's great.... even the bit parts, like Viggo Mortensen in a wheelchair: ""I shit my pants everyday. I can't walk! I can't hump!""  Even the Spanish guy who plays Saso, and doesn't speak a word of English... they all turn in stellar performances!
 
The suspense generated is on par with that of a Tarrantino or Hitchcock flick, and Brian De Palma said that the producers told him the pool scene was too long, and to cut it down.  He took it as meaning ""it's not long enough.""  He intended it to be a very taught scene, and perhaps they had only really seen it for the action at the end.  So he made it longer.  The producers accepted the new version, and it's the one we see in the final film.  Much like the train station scene, it goes on very long and keeps the audience at the edge of their seats.

Film viewers are often bothered when they see a movie which gets details wrong about a subject they are particularly knowledgeable about compared to the public (either because they study this subject, or the filmmakers spending less time on establishing these details correctly, since it might otherwise take away time from the film or obstruct important plot details.

I am *not* talking about implausible or unrealistic science in speculative fiction (particularly science fiction) films, and better yet if we've pretty much all lived through it (like *The Social Network*, which is set in 2003 and beyond, but still tries to be accurate in period details).

Although I'm not exactly a mathematician, such as *Good Will Hunting* or *A Beautiful Mind* (the math is right in this one, but the game theory is explained incorrectly).  But recently, I've been wondering if virtually any film that deals with specialized topics gets things wrong, and I just never notice because I don't have experience with these topics.  

So I'm wondering if you've seen some films that really represent your chosen topic well, realistic portrayals of individuals and experiences, accurate ""props,"" etc.

* Academia
* Law school life
* The restaurant industry
* Finance
* C-suite executive level jobs
* Chemistry
* Theoretical Computer Science
* Software engineering
* Law enforcement
* Priesthood

* Hacker culture
* Stamp collecting
* Comic book collecting
* Psychology

I'd like to start off by saying that I didn't hate the film. I can't say I thought it was excellent either. I enjoyed it in parts but thought it was nothing special. There are some excellent points in the film, we'll come to this later) of the camera work. In particular, there were a few 'fluid' shots which I thought were use particularly well. I enjoyed the sword fight between Jackman and Crowe a lot.

There were a number of things, the incessant close ups of the actors grew tiring and exhausting. So much of the film was close ups of people in despair and sadness. There's nothing wrong with these kinds of shots, and if used more sparingly may have had a much greater affect. However, it almost felt as if Hooper was showing us all these crying faces and screaming 'THEY'RE SAD, BE SAD TOO. CRY! CRY!' Now, a number of people I went with seemed to lap this up and found it all very emotional, but I just felt it was far too unsubtle and unrelenting I grew tired after not very long. 

There are two other problems I have with the film, I may have felt differently, but there were two plot points in particular which grated with me. They both focus on the representation of the revolution in the film. The first was Marius's progression. Throughout the film, he was seen as a young man from wealth who had seen injustice in this world and chosen to live with the poor and fight for revolution and equality. This seemed like a noble cause and a cause that we as the audience were meant to side with. The revolution was good, and the government was bad. After the initial revolution was crushed by the government and Marius was together with Cosette, he seemed to abandon these ideas of revolution and go back to living a wealthy and prosperous life and apparently giving no help to the poor. (Of course, he could've been helping the poor, and at the very least he had returned to his life of riches

The second plot point I had problems with was the ending scene. The revolution had failed, and the only surviving member (that we as an audience knew about) had abandoned the cause. It seemed strange tome, therefore, to see everyone celebrating. I may be missing something here, and please tell me if I am, but this seemed like such a strange ending to a tale of despair and defeat.

Some or a lot of critics (can't decide on one) and people on this and other movie related subreddits have said this film goes nowhere or has no set goal. i believe this view can be tempered if not changed to some extent. i don't know if i will be able to be the catalyst for that but if anything maybe motivate further viewing of what I'm finding to be my favorite PTA film.

The ending informs my take on this film. Where Dodd states as paraphrased by me that ""if Freddy has no Master then he has some unique insight into the world or is the first in the history of the world to be so"". The Master is a film about individuals seeking to control the ""base"" instincts emotions and emotional reactions to become something new that is not what they were before. Dodd in the first part of the film speaks continually about the animal or animal reactions and what humans are compared to what they should be. Processesing is there to take them back so that they can go forward as something pure

This film therefore goes somewhere for me. it goes from the beginning right back to the beginning. however the beginning is now different because of the journey. As i think about what i have watched more and more i am drawn to the research and experiments on teaching primates sign language. these experiments did not translate into primates who could express their feelings or complex emotions

Freddy is what we all are but to an exaggerated degree. He is a passionate man consumed by his emotions and his memories. He is broken in a number of ways. He is taken in by Dodd who sees an experiment and protege. Dodd uses his techniques and in the midst of that we see Freddy sort of moving beyond who he is and then reverting. We also see Dodd

Freddy returns to the beginning at the end of the film still who he is but with the language of the Cause using that as a means to get off. He is a primate that can sign but still a primate. I have read that initially this film was to be the story of Dodd. It was changed to focus on Freddy however i feel Dodds story is just as important. He was made out to be the Master of many but he was not the Master of himself (if thats even possible). So in that, which in itself is easier said than done if that is even an enviable position to be in.

More than A story about PTSD or a cult this is a story about who each person considers themselves to be and how much they think they can change that and how far they think they can remove themselves from the human condition. In that reading i consider this to be a brilliant film that follows the themes of many other PTA films i have seen.

&gt;If you were looking for a whimsical way to kick off the weekend, the film tells the story of a wealthy young inventor of an olfactory-musical instrument (the pianocktail) whose wife develops an illness that can only be treated by surrounding her with flowers. Yep, it doesn't get much more Gondry than that. The film stars Romain Duris (The Beat That My Heart Skipped) and Audrey Tautou (Amelie) as the predictably adorable leads.

""The moment disbelief arises, has failed. You are then out in the Primary World again, looking at the little abortive Secondary World from outside."" 

I also therefore reject excuses made for many shoddily-crafted tentpole films in regard to having to ""suspend disbelief"" in order to enjoy them. While dismissed as ""mindless faire"" they actually cause me to work harder as a viewer.

###**THEME MONTHS** 
*^^^^dah ^^^^de ^^^^dah ^^^^dah!*

Yes, and film appreciation to the entire hippie commune of r/TrueFilm, we are going to try dedicating each month to a specific theme of related films. These may focus on, but are not limited to, the films of individual directors, ""Wave"" movements, genres, etc. The number of selected films will vary.
___
The theme for August is: **Westerns**.
___
Frequently overlooked among cinephiles, the Western has gone through countless re-imaginings, while at the same time influencing films as diverse as *Citizen Kane*, *Lawrence of Arabia*, and *Star Wars*.

The films selected for review are as follows:

| Film   | Director    | Date of Discussion     |
|:-----------|------------:|:------------:|
| [*Stagecoach* \(1939\)](http://redd.it/1jvxe2)        |          John Ford|     August 7     
| [*The Treasure of the Sierra Madre* \(1948\)](http://redd.it/1k3e2q) |    John Huston|  August 10   
| [*Winchester '73* \(1950\)](http://redd.it/1kcxjo)      |        Anthony Mann|   August 14
| *The Tall T* (1957)      |        Budd Boetticher|   August 17
| *For A Few Dollars More* (1965)      |        Sergio Leone|   August 21
| *The Wild Bunch* (1969)       |        Sam Peckinpah|   August 24
| *Unforgiven* (1992)       |        Clint Eastwood|   August 28
| *Dead Man* (1995)       |        Jim Jarmusch|  August 31

Now I know what you're thinking: 'Hey, and hopefully you will gain a broader perspective and search out the masterpieces and hidden gems for yourself. In the interest of maintaining interest, we have tried to keep the actors and directors of each film as varied as possible. We will use the feedback from this trial run to determine the future course of this program.

Thanks for reading

I feel that the point of *Antoinette* is entirely missed by many expecting an historical drama and are unfamiliar with Coppola's style and use of themes to drive her films rather than an overarching story. 

Antoinette enters Versaille without any friends or possessions

Many have focused on the lack of historicity in the film but I feel that misses the entire point. The film uses Marie Antoinette as a vessel to her themes rather than a point unto itself - Coppola uses Antoinette as a backdrop to advance the narrative. The lack of investigation into the politics of the time, the film is about Antoinette's experiences as a stranger in a stranger's land - the film is from her perspective and including these aspects would not contribute to Coppola's theme. If you go into the film expecting a biopic you will be disappointed. The use of modern music in this apparent period piece further reinforces that foreignness of an Austrian princess in the court of Versailles and emphasises the similarity of Antoinette's position with those that may be experienced in the present day - essentially Coppola is illustrating the timelessness of her theme.

1362588504.0,19s73i,A look back at Silver Linings Playbook,harrythemay,94,41,62,"I've been thinking about this film a lot since Jennifer Lawrence won Best Actress for her role. The film was not a bad film

The wedding tape scene where Pat has an episode was acutely accurate and genuinely gave some insight into the character more than any other scenes. David O. Russell's direction wasn't mocking of depression or bipolar disorder and I think he made this film to raise awareness (to an extent) about mental illness. However

My main dispute with the film was the last half hour or so. Up until the football game it was moving at a nice pace (although I would have liked a bit more focus on Tiffany) and there was plenty of room to look more into both their mental illnesses but instead what we're given is Pat gleefully hanging out with his therapist who is then racially abused and attacked. That whole scenario was completely ludicrous. Firstly, won't they' scenario. It was just too much for me to overlook and it became painfully obvious to me that they were going to win and everything was going to be fine. 

Which gets me to the ending where everything is fine. That was a real insult to my intelligence and to anyone out there who actually suffers from both depression and bipolar disorder. I know you could dispute that the ending was ambiguous as to whether Pat would get better but you're really clutching at a thin argument there. I would have happily accepted such an outcome if this film wasn't constantly being shown as 'the rom-com about bipolar disorder.' If the first half wasn't focused on his disorder then again maybe I would have let it slide but it was and I couldn't accept such an ending. Having one good thing happen to you isn't going to end your turmoil and to suggest such a thing turned the film from being a sensitive look at a mental illness to yet just another platform for some actors and a director to get some nominations. 

I was going to write a bit about why I didn't particularly find Jennifer Lawrence's character engaging and how she was more of a plot device than a character but I've wrote quite a lot. Anyway

**TL;DR**: Silver Linings Playbook started out as a sincere portrayal of mental illness and ended being another stereotypical rom-com that served as a platform for Academy nominations via the age-old method of playing someone with a disability.

This all began in 2010, with little to no publicity, was attended by people from miles around. There were very long queues. People wanted to see this slow, dark, brooding Swedish film on a big screen and were wiling to travel far and wide, and risk the entire journey being pointless (tickets couldn't be booked). 

At the time, they clicked with this film. I began researching cult movies for an article. I discovered that little liked films I liked - *Drop Dead Fred,* *Freddie Got Fingered* - had cult followings, particularly amongst child abuse survivors (which I am). I found that people I knew who worked in TV adored the film *Network*. I discovered that Robin Williams was utterly beloved by people who suffer from mental health problems (which again, I suffer from). Before I got anywhere near finishing my research, the magazine I worked for was swallowed whole by the depths of the credit crunch and I forgot about it.

Earlier today, vaguely surreal comedies? Why do the boring people from the office dress in leather and attend midnight screenings of *The Rocky Horror Picture Show*? I'm wondering if there are answers to these questions

I'm pretty happy for Tokyo story placing so high on both lists (no. 3 and no. 1), purpose, style, genre, etc.  So perhaps *Tokyo* story is so singularly the best film of it's kind that it places so high.

Directors with more than two films on the list:

* Godard (4)
* Coppola (3)
* Dreyer (3)
* Tarkovsky (3)

I would have expected those sorts of numbers more from Kubrick (1), Kurosawa (2), or Bergman (1), although maybe they need a top 100 to pack that much punch.  That said, Coppola isn't that much of a surprise, since it's always those three films.

WWII saw the participation of many Hollywood figures: John Ford, creating war films, witnessing the carnage, and in some cases even participating in the battles. While it's impossible to determine the effect of the War on any individual's psyche, it's clear that the country, and the World, suffered a loss of innocence during the War years.

In response, a number of industry professionals, including John Huston and William Wyler, founded the [Committee for the First Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_the_First_Amendment), a political action group protesting HUAC's activities. Their influence was negligible and subject to open and hostile criticism. Many of the participants would fall under suspicion themselves and some, John Garfield, would be forced to explain his actions in a March

Against this backdrop, but also other gunmen pursuing their own ends. Thus, the Western, much like the Hollywood of the day, became a dangerous place filled with competing alliances and traitorous backstabbers, real and imagined.

Personally I think the whole thing is pretty Freudian and allegorical. It's meant to symbolise Max trying to come to terms with things about his personality that he isn't comfortable with. Things that as a younger kid he may not have noticed, lack of confidence, etc, but Carol (the main one) represents the key specific problem to Max (the one that drove him to that allegorical island) - his 'wild' nature. 

Basically his retreat into fantasy is very much about psychologically reconciling the guilt he feels about attacking his mum. His time on the island mirrors his life before the island - the snowball fight/the mud fight to use one particular example, and after finally finding inner peace can return back to reality. 

I think it's a beautiful expression of what it's like to grow up. It's not necessarily about losing these negative emotions- the Wild Things are still there

1359190304.0,17b4co,Looper: The rebirth of classic sci-fi,bwaxxlo,115,60,185,"**I couldn't sleep tonight

It was last summer when I watched the trailer to Looper. It was a promising time for Joseph Gordon-Levitt as he seemed to be picking up gigs left and right. At the time it looked like another cash-in on this new A-list figure before Daniel Radcliffe is old enough to not be associated with wand jokes. I wondered whether JGL was taking it all in to quickly without learning to say no. Premium Rush had just come out and JGL was the lead actor as a NYC bike messenger being chased around by cars due to a package he was in charge of delivering (?). At least that was what the TV spots led me to believe. Let’s not forget his role in The Dark Knight Rises

My initial reaction to Looper was the complication with time travel plots. Ever since Terminator 2, but surely the writer could’ve used better story devices. Is time travel worth the risk? Why would you risk your audience over thinking while watching the film?

How wrong I was. Looper knew its audience. And it did answer my first question rather early. When 30-year senior Joseph Simmons (Bruce Willis) from the future and the present Joseph (JGL) sit in a diner


&gt;Old Joe (Bruce Willis): It’s hard staring into your eyes. It’s too strange.

&gt;Joe (JGL): You’re face looks backwards.

&gt;Old Joe: Yeah.

&gt;Joe: So

&gt;Old Joe: I don’t wanna talk about time travel shit. Cause if we start talking about it

&gt;Joe: If I hurt myself it changes your body. This is what I do now

&gt;[suddenly old Joe snaps in anger]

&gt;Old Joe: It doesn’t matter!

Looper screamed at us to shut up. It knew that we are looking for answers that don’t matter and wouldn’t solve the current problem. Just like the young arrogant Joe

On the subject of self awareness, are just copying other movies. Goddamn 20th century affectations. Do something new!” Could the film be any clearer? And he, too, clears up on the confusion of time travel paradoxes, “On top of which, a man from the future runs free long enough — [in a disgruntled and frustrated voice] — this time travel shit fries your brain like an egg.” It is quite clear that the film knows that it stands on pillars that might or might not exist (Schrödinger’s pillars?). But the fact that it’s not falling, makes it pointless to worry about the pillars.

One of the classic rules of cinema is simply “Show, however interesting, seems to act like a gateway into this magical world. The plot shouldn’t be there to hold together the fictional world. Quite contrary, the world should be large enough to hold up the plot and several others too. This applies to any fictional world whether in film, book or any other work of art. I caught myself imagining the despondent revelation of the telekinetic characters on their seemingly promising powers yielding disappointing results. The eye-drops drugs seemed to have an interesting story as Joe was quite addicted to them. These were heavy elements with equally interesting stories when compared to our main plot. Looper exposed these elements but never said a word about it. Leave it for the imagination.

In a time when the genre seems to be replaced by “comic-book sci-fi” Looper loudly reminded Sci-fi

(Spoilers)",xxmindtrickxx,68,16,38,"Hey guys, that is a very lengthy topic so I thought I'd focus on explaining some of the more controversial aspects.

**First let me explain the role of the villain Anton.** What Anton is **not** is a supernatural personification of death like in Ingmar Bergman’s the seventh seal. I think this is a common misconception; he is however an incredibly arrogant and incredibly talented killer. He has a god-complex, as to Moss not understanding how Chigurh knows this will all play out, “it doesn’t matter where she is”. 

Anton believes he is an entity of fate. He believes he knows how things will go and only he moves through and directs fate. The best scene to understand this is in the Coin Toss scene, his only form of mercy is a coin toss, like a coin toss no one but god, fate or someone who could see the future can predict the coins outcome, it’s his only fair method of releasing someone, by allowing fate to decide. Fate brought you to him; Anton judges you and only fate can release you.

Anyone who “sees” Anton, and only by his determination, are they allowed to live or die.  Anyone who contests him has to die and anyone that denies liability must be tried by fate through a coin toss. 

The ending is a very important part of the movie because there we see that he is not supernatural (for ambiguity purposes: I’m not referring to the fact that he can be injured). When Carla Jean Moss refuses to call the coin she contests him by claiming no liability and refuses to select

Anton is then forced to get help from two young boys who he pays $100 for one of their shirts which he uses to wrap his arm. This action shows Anton passing into the age of an old man by requiring the help of the young and likewise corrupting the young boys with money and asking them to lie about the crime scene and say they never saw him. As the boys break out into an argument Anton walks off.

This is one of the most brilliant scenes of the movie because in just a ten minute period the Coen Brothers concisely defined and completed the nature of their villain. 

Anton’s injury and implied fall denies the theory of a supernatural existence. The theme of the movie is reinforced by showing the corruption of the young kids

This is a representation of an outlook on how evil exists. As simple of an act as supporting evil by giving your shirt, like Carla Jean, can stop it from existing, and ignorance does not absolve you from actions and consequences that could return.

**The Dreams**

The next scene shows Ed Tom Bell

""Alright then. Two of 'em. Both had my father in 'em . It's peculiar. I'm older now then he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night. Goin' through this pass in the mountains. It was cold and there was snow on the ground and he rode past me and kept on goin'. Never said nothin' goin' by. He just rode on past... and he had his blanket wrapped around him and his head down and when he rode past I seen he was carryin' fire in a horn the way people used to do and I could see the horn from the light inside of it. 'Bout the color of the moon. And in the dream I knew that he was goin' on ahead and he was fixin' to make a fire somewhere out there in all that dark and all that cold, and I knew that whenever I got there he would be there. And then I woke up...""

**The first dream:**

This dream has some ambiguity

My first thoughts on this dream were that the money represents the riches of the old generation being lost on the new generation. 

However, was used throughout the film to create parallels between the characters. 

Example of the parallel:
Such as in one of the first scenes with Anton he kills the man with the bolt-action air pistol

The second dream seems to be the more important dream.

His father is carrying the fire ahead through the night and cold. Fire representing hope

He says the fire had the light of the moon in it

 This fire can only continue if someone rides ahead in the night to build a fire for when you get deep into the cold and night. 

Bell faces the cold and night in his interior struggle to be a part of the world when he re-enters the old crime scene, before entering he pulls his gun, something he hadn’t done before, this suggests as an old man he is re-entering the young mans world, saying like he mentioned earlier in the film “Ok, I’ll be a part of this world”. However he doesn’t see Anton, but the fear of the situation and the events of chasing this criminal have enough affect to make him retire.

**A common question of the film.**

Why don’t the Coen Brothers show the death of Moss?

Most of my friends were really annoyed by this and at this point, it supports the archetype of the villain. By not showing his death and forcing you to assume Moss is the dead man in the pool the scene greatly reinforces the arrogance and supernatural appearance of Anton. Additionally I don’t believe this movie was a huge budget so they may have done it because of budget constraints.

1355168760.0,14mbsk,The art and use of over-acting.,xxmindtrickxx,66,14,31,"tl;dr: Overacting is a real style used by directors and actors but is often dismissed for bad acting because of the culture of american film goers

Hey guys I'd like to take a minute to talk about over acting and how it is used. Basically since American Cinema has no name for it I’ll just refer to it as over acting. However Japanese cinema does have a name for it, such as when the exiled emperor is going crazy.

American Cinema also uses overacting but because it is less understood as being a part of the style of the film and has no traditional stance it is often miss interpreted as bad acting and then people cast off a movie for the wrong reasons.

**What is overacting:** Overacting is basically when an actor uses more emphasis or animation than what a typical person would use or how an audience would expect a person to react

**Why it is used:** Overacting is used for a variety of reasons and often depends on the genre of the film. In Horror and comedy it is most often used for humorous or satirical reasons. For instance the Scream movies, both have a tongue in cheek humor that effectively uses overacting.

Overacting in dramas is used to create a surreal feeling and that what your experiencing is more akin to something of a dream rather than something that is realistic or could actually occur. Perhaps the best director to use overacting effectively is James Cameron; other notable directors would be David Lynch and Stanley Kubrick

Overacting is essential to Cameron’s style; it allows him to turn scenarios of a heartbroken drama into a fairy tale love story.  People often have said that a Cameron film is more of an experience than a movie, stunning visuals and well developed score. But without overacting his movies would have more of a serious feeling to them than the fairy tale feeling. To better understand this I would recommend reading the scripts to Aliens and Titanic (in Aliens really concentrate on Bill Paxton’s character), just notice how ridiculously cheesy all the lines look on paper, but how when your watching the movie you seem to let that part slide by you. Cameron is basically using overacting as an element to his style which I would describe as semi-surrealist.

Cameron’s use of overacting does however differ from other directors such as David Lynch and Kubrick who use overacting simply for it’s surrealist effects to make things seem more dream like. The tones of their films are much more serious

Overacting can be used in other ways as well. Another very well known and notable example would be Kevin Spacey in the Usual Suspect 

**(Spoiler alert do not read further if you plan on seeing the usual suspect)**

If you watch when he is explaining his story within the movie during the present time he can’t seem to deliver a line worth a damn

I encourage you guys to go out and watch some of these films for yourself and make up your own opinion these are simply my thoughts about how overacting is used in American Cinema. Just because an actor seems to be delivering something poorly stop for a second to look at the film as a whole and see if it fits the style

I must warn you right up front though, I'm going to make an argument for him not being any of those and all of those at the same time.

The first thing you have to learn is something that in my case took a fairly long time to understand fully: sometimes, as a puzzle to be solved to reveal the ultimate meaning. Truth is, some puzzles cannot be completely assembled. Any Beach House fans in here? Could you explain why a song such as Lazuli is so emotional even though it seems to be talking about nothing? It's because the selection and placing of words along with the execution of the voice and the music makes it emotional, and yet you couldn't explain what the song is about in the same way you could explain Adele's Someone Like You for example (not giving her shit though, I love her). Charlie Kaufman is someone who's very notably against movie clichés, in fact the whole ""Adaptation"" script revolves around making a non-traditional film and failing. He has repeatedly said he hates movies with an ending such as ""and it tuns out he was dead all along"" because it's a big cop out. So the first thing to understand is this, the movie doesn't have an ""aha!"" moment at the end to make everything fall into place, for example

I've been a Kaufman fan for a while now so I actually read the script for Synecdoche before they started shooting it, by all means get a copy right this instant. Not only it's one of the most epic books you'll likely to read, it also shares many points with this movie. Synecdoche has a lot of magic realism, which was popularized by Márquez. What it means is that you'll have a dream logic running through out the story, and you'll come across impossible things that happen without anyone question it. In the novel for example (minor spoiler), there's a female character that is so graceful it's constantly referred as an angel. There comes a point that she is hanging laundry and all of the sudden she develops wings and fly to heaven, never to be seen again. This is similar to many of the things that happen on Synecdoche, I see

So what's the house about? The brilliant thing about this movie is that it presents visual allegories all the time. By this you may think you have to be very intelligent to ""get"" the movie but it's not the case. Those scenes act both as allegories but also as jokes. On a personal note, it was her choice all along. I can relate to that because I also have made decisions knowing full well the outcome would be catastrophic, but you just can't help it. Now, what's brilliant about this is that you may see that scene and you can have your own personal interpretation, and if you don't make an interpretation then you can laugh your ass off because of how funny it actually is.

As someone who's seen the movie more times that I care to admit and seeing it on different moments of my life, which it later turns out it was actually a really long, long message (""My father died... He had cancer, they said..."" etc). Cuts to a very tiny coffin being buried and Caden's mom saying they had to fill it with cotton to keep the body from rattling around. It's funny, it's very funny, and it's also heartbreaking and horrifying. Both reactions are great. The thing is, you have to watch the movie without trying to interpret it

So, is just that Caden is everyone because we all share the same feelings of loss, grief and disappointment. We all think we are the protagonists. And yet as you get older you start to lose those things you thought made you special, and the line between you and the rest gets more blurry by the minute. That's why I don't think the ending is depressing. He finds someone that works both as a deus-ex machina and a maternal figure. He is able to connect with her for a moment, a true connection that makes him feel understood and cared for. It's not much, but it's really the only thing we can all hope to get. But again, this is only a personal interpretation. Keep in mind the movie's called ""Synecdoche"", I personally don't think it fails by a huge mark.",t5_2szp0,True

I see it as Fred murdering his wife after she cheats on him, that's up for debate; if it's physical then it could be seen as his ""punishment"" and if it's mental then it definitely feeds into the idea of never escaping yourself, because then the film is quite the opposite entirely. Personally, in context with Lynch's other kinds of films, I'd assume it's a dreamworld.

To me I see him becoming Pete as Fred wanting to run away from himself and his life

Of course it doesn't stay this way and it's out of his desire for a woman, yet he also is obviously struggling at points with the knowledge that she's slept with other men, especially in pornography. But, in this, it wasn't much of her decision, which allows him to cope. In reality Fred has no such way of accepting his wife's infidelity as she is willingly choosing to be with someone besides him. 

When they are later having sex in front of the car and Pete turns back into Fred I see it as him finally fully becoming himself again

He's reminded of his guilt and of reality but is still trying to escape it and by the ending of the film he is being chased down by the police; reality and his sense of guilt is overcoming him but he still is uselessly fighting it, encapsulated in his guilt and pain.

As far as the Mystery Man is concerned, the phone call, etc. all to me indicate this and also the way in which while he's with his wife, the Mystery Man appears and reminds Fred of his home while he's at a party. Being reminded of his house and a man answering is to me the idea of him dealing with the suspicion of another man being with his wife, in a sense replacing him at home.

I see the idea of Pete and most of the film being Fred's desperate attempt at escape through a dreamworld/delusion backed up by my other favorite Lynch film, even after becoming someone else completely. It seems to be a semi-recurring motif in Lynch's films and I think it makes the film make the most sense.

Article Text: Interpreting Malick

Its been almost a year since Terrence Malick released the enigmatic “Tree of Life”, it wasn't cohesive enough or it needed another round of editing. Although Terrence Malick's films are not above reproach it is surprising that critics tend to focus on the elements of Malick's directing that set him apart from other filmmakers. If Malick were to take the advice of his detractors he would probably become a more focused storyteller, but he would also no longer be Malick. It is the meandering narrative and initially obscure meanings that have earned Malick so much respect. So how is it that Mallick earns praise and criticism for the same aspects of his work? 
Malick is making films from a different perspective than any other contemporary filmmaker

Although little is known about the reclusive Malick
	
Malick and Heidegger

Before becoming a filmmaker Malick had a promising start as a philosopher. He graduated with a degree in philosophy from Harvard and did graduate work as a Rhodes scholar in german philosophy. After teaching at MIT and still in his twenties he traveled to Germany and met with Martin Heidegger before publishing a translation of Heidegger's “The Essence of Reasons”.

It is tempting to over-emphasize Malick's background in philosophy when analyzing his films. Malick’s background would suggest that Heideggerian thought was a strong influence on his own personal philosophy. However any attempts to connect the philosophy embodied in Malick's work and Heideggerian themes has been fruitless. In fact many themes in Malick's films hint at metaphysical concepts that heidegger would have rejected outright.

If we can trace any influence of Heidegger on Malick's work it is in his methodology, use that proposition to draw conclusions about reality and then mistakenly use those conclusions to support their original proposition. This seems like an obvious mistake to make but the difficulty of philosophical writing tends to hide circular fallacies from even the most brilliant minds.
Heidegger realized that since all ideas are related to each other it is impossible to avoid circular thinking entirely. The questions was how to use the circular nature of ideas without falling prey to logical fallacies. To do that Heidegger would jump into the circle with a rough outline of a particular idea and then instead of immediately drawing conclusions, like uncovering the foundations of a building—with each shovel full of dirt you take away you get a better idea of what lies beneath the surface and where next to dig.

Mallick’s Hermeneutics

Terrence Mallick seems to employ a variation of the hermeneutic circle in his films, climax and resolution. While Malick clearly violates this traditional structure by interrupting it with poetic montages of images of nature, music and voiced questions, his most drastic break from tradition is in the way he develops themes.

In this sense he bears influence from Heidegger's hermeneutic circle. Movies that try to convey an idea have a formula

Narrative is key to Malick’s process. It creates opportunities to ask questions. These questions can be phrased in voice-overs, but each of these questions serves the same purpose: they throw the viewer into the hermeneutic circle by  asking a question. Once a question has been expressed Malick directs his narrative to explore these questions, giving us situations to see our answers affirmed or challenged so that we can better understand the question. 

True to the hermeneutic circle Malick continually returns to the same themes throughout his films.  But each time a question is asked the images we have seen inform us so that we can ask the question with greater insight. Instead of building up

Circles in “The Thin Red Line”

There is evidence of a hermeneutic circle in each of Malick’s films but it is particularly apparent in “The Thin Red Line”. The first lines we hear are the voice of Private Witt

What's this war in the heart of nature? Why does nature vie with itself?

This question is our starting point in the circle, shots of vibrantly colored birds give way to burnt fields and craters. At one point a beautiful low-shot of light seeping through the jungle canopy transitions seamlessly into an image of a dying bird, obviously wounded and covered in mud slowly flapping its wings and struggling to move. This montage of images forces us to consider the first question spoken in the film: why does nature vie with itself? 

The war narrative ramps up and we are caught up in the efforts of the U.S. army soldiers to take a hill fortified by the japanese. For some time we are bombarded with the circumstances of war--an almost indistinguishable blend of malice, until unexpectedly in voice-over narration Private Witt reiterates the original theme of the film and connects the disparate images we have witnessed:

One man looks at a dying bird and
thinks there's nothing but unanswered pain.                   
But death's got the final word.
lt's laughing at him.
Another man sees that same bird
feels the glory.
Feels something smiling through him.

It becomes apparent that the original questions about conflict in nature
This isn’t an answer to the original questions: “What's this war in the heart of nature? Why does nature vie with itself?” But now we are better equipped to ask these questions

Malick’s films don’t usually provide us with conclusions that can be expressed in a sentence or written on a plaque. The hermeneutic circle isn’t designed to find answers, however, that he falls prey to the old cliche that answers aren’t important, only questions. I think he realizes that we have to provide our own answers, but those answers are impossible to find if we don’t understand what we are asking.

Viewing Malick's work as a hermeneutic circle gives us a lens to examine his films. Rather than giving token criticism of his loose editing or his rambling storylines we can criticize the effect his narrative and style have in developing thematic questions. This type of analysis is limited because there is certainly more to his films than a formulaic technique,,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,True

Towards the end of the 19^th Century, bringing the frontier life to the public in the form of Wild West Shows and 10¢ novels. Decades before the concept of a superhero was even created, larger-than-life figures such as Buffalo Bill and Annie Oakley dominated the public conscious.

The new medium of film was not long in exploiting this interest. While there were some attempts with the genre several years beforehand, camera panning, parallel editing, double exposures, and even color were all utilized or introduced for the first time. Not much from 1903 still survives, but *The Great Train Robbery*'s famous last shot is paid homage by *Goodfellas* (1990), *American Gangster* (2007)

In the following decades, and William S. Hart were a few of the ones who enjoyed success in the genre. In 1917, John Ford debuted on the scene, directing 41 silent Westerns before the arrival of sound in 1928, most of which are lost. 

Gradually however, and with sound and the Crash of 1929, Westerns were generally relegated to B-status. A number of Westerns tried for critical legitimacy; *The Big Trail* (1930) with John Wayne's first starring role was filmed in pioneering 70mm widescreen. The Great Depression and the costs of installing sound systems caused theaters to balk at retooling for widescreen projection, and so the financial failure of the film caused the format to disappear until the 1950s, and relegated John Wayne to B-movies for nearly a decade. *Cimarron* (1931) won Best Picture, but had negligible impact and today has the dubious distinction of being among the worst winners of the prize.

*Stagecoach* is perhaps best known today for being the film Orson Welles studied while making *Citizen Kane* (1941). Its influence however goes a bit beyond that.

This is the first Ford film shot in Monument Valley, forever linking the location with the genre. Remember all the wacky scenery Wile E. Coyote chases the Road Runner through in *Looney Tunes*? You can thank Ford for that.

John Wayne's career took off after *Stagecoach*, his most degrading role in *The Deceiver* (1931) after running afoul of legendary SOB Harry Cohn). He would go on to play a staggering ~100 leading roles, 12 of those with Ford.

Did the stagecoach chase scene remind you a little of *Ben-Hur* (1959)? Well good, *Spartacus* (1960), and yes *Ben-Hur*, where he staged the epic chariot race scene while his son Joe Canutt doubled for Charlton Heston. His stunts in *Stagecoach*, jumping between horses and being dragged under the coach, would be homaged by Spielberg in *Raiders of the Lost Ark* (1981) with the German truck chase, and *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade* (1989) with Indy's jump from the horse onto the tank.

Stagecoach's critical and commercial success revitalized the moribund genre

Moretz on the other hand looks like the popular girl in school with slightly less make up and bad posture.

This might seem like nitpicking, but if you take away that emotional core of the movie, you take away that tragedy of the saddest girl you've ever met getting to become prom queen only to have it taken away, and all you're left with is a girl who has a crazy mom and can move shit with her mind.

I read an article that said Bergman wasn't really taught in film classes because he was kind of irrelevant to the history of cinema. I can't remember what it was called but I think I found it through a roger ebert article he wrote after Bergman's death. Do you agree with this? I can't see it being true *if only* because he influenced Woody Allen so much and I feel like his cultural impact is undeniable. 

If you don't like Bergman movies is it because you find them pretentious? This is a bit of a tangent so skip this paragraph if you want... But I felt like a lot of people had that opinion when The Tree of Life came out and I couldn't help but feel they didn't understand what being earnest is.

Martha was inducted into a cult, who focus on the collective more than on the individual (though of course, this collective exists to serve the cult leader Patrick).  it attracts lost young women, many of whom are trying to escape their old identities.  they are slowly conditioned to view themselves as non-entities.  they get new names, they are raped in their sleep by Patrick - a disorienting and traumatic experience that will either drive them away, or, push them deeper into psychological shells and disconnect them from their lives and identities.  the cult's reasoning for stealing from others is a hyper-socialist mentality that all of humanity is part of this collective, location or self

as i mentioned earlier with the title, is played by Brady Corbet.  he menaces Martha/Marcy near the beginning of the film.  at the end, Martha sees a man from a distance, who looks a lot like this character, but is played by a different actor.  meanwhile Martha's sister's husband is framed in several scenes to resemble Patrick, a skinny dark haired looming figure.  adding to the confusion is the frequent repetition of words in dialogue - ""it feels nice to put on something nice and comfortable"" - and the title itself. 

there is also a deep, at least until the end, but they are always there as a threat, a brilliantly rendered psychological monster - in a flashback we see them breaking into a fairly isolated upper-middle class home, quite similar to Martha's sister's.  then in present day, Martha and her sister are arguing and the scene is encompassed mostly in one shot - Martha's POV of her sister, who only occupies the bottom half of the frame, but they were able to find Martha earlier.  and they have every reason to kill Martha and her family.  this is what's on Martha's mind for the duration of this timeline, is the most terrifying moment.  past that point it's just total despair,

Having just watched *Pulp Fiction*

Every scene, long-fuse, time bombs.

&gt;2. An explosive conclusion often laden with violence and plot-driving mechanics. 

While I wholeheartedly enjoy this structure, that something felt lacking.

For those who have not seen it, the two decide to meet in person, and then go back to the house that Jeff (played by the immaculate Patrick Wilson) owns. Things then take a drastic turn as Hayley drugs, traps, and mentally tortures him.

This film got a lot of criticism due to the touchy subject matter overall. Sure, you're watching flirty chat-messages, Hayley pulling her clothes off on Jeff's couch, and a truly cringe-worthy castration scene. 

Some people also disliked Hard Candy because it didn't follow the traditional bad-guy-and-victim scenario. Jeff was not portrayed as a monster, charming, likable man. He seemed like the sort of man you would see shopping at the supermarket with his family, or pulling weeds from his front lawn. Jeff, however, was involved in a little girl's murder... And yet we end up desperately hoping for Jeff to escape Hayley's torture games by the halfway mark in the film. Many people disliked that they felt sympathy for Jeff, but I think that's what makes this movie unique. Rather than leaving the theater (or in my case, we feel uncomfortable that Jeff died.

While I clearly acknowledge the overarching message concerning the readiness of society to not only believe

Throughout the entire film, the following scene where Torsten and Klara are building a Christmas scene together, and the final scene when the camera pans around, focusing on Torsten's face. I also noticed there were multiple instances in which Theo snapped suddenly, and rather menacingly from a calm and loving demeanor to one much more tense, almost foreboding. First, when Lucas has to take Klara to school because Theo is too busy screaming at his wife, when Theo attacks Lucas in his own home, ""Agnes

The combination of these two observations were verified (in my mind) by the final scene. 

When Marcus was ""becoming a man"" in the ceremony of sorts, who is already looking directly at Lucas (similar to the way Lucas was looking at Theo during the Christmas sermon). Torsten's face is bruised, and he looks as though he's seen a ghost and quickly moves his gaze. Then, when Lucas is shot at in the woods he looks up at his assailant, who clearly has the means to kill him, but chooses to run instead. I saw this, in my mind

Hear me out here, Torsten, and probably Agnes. In the scene where Theo brings Lucas food from their party, Lucas may or may not realize what has been going on, I'm not entirely certain about that... but I think Theo wanting to stay with Lucas instead of return to his family was his guilt about throwing his friend under the bus for something he had done (or had been doing). Torsten's look of utter desperation in the final scene was the nail in the coffin for me. When he and Lucas made eye contact, I saw it as a painful, yet faint mutual understanding of the situation. This would then give Torsten motivation to cry for help by shooting at Lucas, ""You know whats going on here

The most frustrating thing to me is that they could have very easily made the movie fit in with everything that we know about science and kept the basic idea of the premise intact. I am talking about the nakedly stupid idea that the ""engineers"" share the same DNA as us. Being that we share 98% of our DNA with chimpanzees, this premise would make sense. For example, the back story could have been that the aliens landed here 1.5 million years ago and saw that our pre-human ancestors had the potential to be evolved into an intelligent, self-aware species. They set up a colony, did selective breeding for quite a while, and then left us to our own devices once civilization started to form, leaving us a beacon to their homeworld so that we could come visit them someday. We go visit to find out that they wiped themselves out with their own genetic experiments.

This took me 5 minutes to come up with after the movie. Why couldn't a team of experts, and it jives with everything we know about our history (namely, that it is an irrefutable fact that we are apes).

Furthermore, it would make it far less easy to read its emotional states, making it seem a whole lot less retarded when he begins acting like a monster.

The Act of Killing follows several now elderly gangsters who were recruited as death squad leaders by the Indonesian military during the 1965 coup. They ended up on the winning side of the conflict; and as such

This is not a typical doc where the victims families are interviewed and the perpetrators condemned. Instead, reenacting torture methods that they performed on real people. You want to laugh because it's so outrageous but that thought makes you sick when you're reminded that these are real murderers who did these things to real people.

It's a strange but ingenious approach. By not confronting or condemning these men, twist, distort, and deny a reality that is too horrible to come to terms with.

The Act Of Killing paints the portrait of a monster. One that is so terrifying because it is so human.

**The Wrath of the Jungle**

In Aguirre, silent, and nightmarish exploration of man vs. nature.


Klaus Kinski plays Aguirre and his performance is powerful. Moving with an odd loping and limping gait he moves around the lone raft like a tightly wound protohuman dictator. His piercing blue eyes and long blonde hair stands him out from the rest of the would-be conquistadors like an angel turned demonic

The most powerful aspect of the film is Herzog’s portrayal of the looming forest. In every shot and frame it rests in the background like a green veil. Beyond it is the unknowable. Where the Indians hide, and the silent watcher where the absence of noise brings on the presence of an alien gaze. It is an unstoppable  force.

And it is laughable that Aguirre and the men think that they may conquer or control this land. Sitting upon rafts that float midstream past walls of vegetation like the walls of a hedge maze they claim ownership over what they fear above all else. Herzog explores the true power of these men and of Aguirre’s claim that he is the wrath of god. If Aguirre speaks the truth
Herzog fits all of this into a tight and unsettlingly beautiful film that shows the primordial conflict of man vs. nature and its nightmarish human inadequacy with an operatic style and piercing clarity like A Heart of Darkness turned medieval.

So, Yasujirō Ozu, was the most resistant to the talkies, making his last silent film in 1935.

Most, narrator and commentator when silent films were screened at theaters. Benshis even became celebrities to a certain extent. Audiences would attend certain screenings in accordance to the Benshi who was presenting the picture. Actually, the concept of a Benshi strikes me as an incredibly interesting one. Because Benshies were there to basically explain the action to the audiences, directors felt much more liberated to explore complex narrative structures. However, the Benshi were mostly gone by 1933. Interestingly enough, the Benshi Strike of 1932 was led by Akira Kurosawa's older brother, Heigo Kurosawa.

Shochiku, which dramatized the lives of the middle class. Note that this is years before Italian Neo-Realism (though these two styles are different). The shomingeki style was infamous for making one laugh and cry within the same breath. Some of the other characteristics of these films consisted of: Hollywood influences, contemporary settings, middle class characters with stories expressing anxieties caused by modernization, extensive and realistic depiction of landscape, and was auteur centered. An interesting fact is that while most people attributed the low-camera style to Ozu, the usage of the low camera was actually heavily used in most Shochiku films seeing as how the director's hired by this studio stole from each other in means of unifying the studio's films as one collective work. As time progressed they eventually went off into their own styles. It is important to note though that no camera went as low as Yasujirō Ozu's whose flat angles would never reveal the floors or the ceilings of interiors.

Now, I want to discuss how this film perfectly fits into the collective of Shomingeki films. It revolves around 2 sibling brothers' struggle in assimilating with their new school as they face conflicts against a gang of kids, but later familial conflicts as they begin to fear for their own future as their respect for their father rapidly declines as they see the inferiority he displays amongst his boss.

Like most shomingeki films, planes and coffee shops are all common within mostly ever scene. This was an important factor because Ozu wanted to make films where the audiences lived. This went from predominantly countryside landscapes to suburban areas being key to shomingeki cinema. A popular stereotype of Japanese cinema of the time was that the entire plot was comprised merely of meditating characters conversing in Haiku. As ridiculous as that sounds,  there was some truth in that. Ozu would frequently show characters converse spontaneously in a mountain top or a field of grass without obvious relevance to the story. Many Shochiku films were known to do this as well. However, these particular scenes would give information about the characters in terms of how the landscapes they chose to surround themselves in would reveal their social status. 

Social status is an extremely essential element in 'I Was Born' because it highlights the weak male figure of our protagonists' father in how his role in society damages his appearance as a father. The children in this story are yearning for the traditional role of the father to come out. However, many of the jokes of this film are lost in translation, but some are obvious when involving body parts. Ozu breaks the characters into pieces. Close-ups and stationary shots of: scratching heads, scratching genitals, spankings, odd facial expressions etc... All of these shots are juxtaposed next to dramatic events. Again, laughing and crying is key when it comes to Shochiku films.

Anyway, Shochiku Studio or Japanese Late Silent Cinema. Thanks for reading.",,False,,t5_2szp0,False,,

##


When you think about films and Sweden, resulting in stilted performances that films feels more like theatre than cinema. However not everyone shares the same filmmaking ideals as Bergman and most prominent of those opposing the perceived stuffiness of Bergman was Bo Widerberg.



Bo Widerberg was a man with a vision, a vision where films felt alive and he articulated this vision in his 1962 book *Visionen i svensk film*|*A Vision of Swedish Cinema*.


Born the 8th of July 1930 in Malmö


Starting his career as a writer he made his debut with *Hösttermin*|*Fall Semster* in 1952


The international breakthrough came with the 1967 film *Elvira Madigan* gaining several awards and nominations (including BAFTA


Towards the end of the seventies Widerberg moved from feature filmmaking to TV-production and theatre due to various reasons including his mounting problems with funding despite his acclaim.


Bo Widerberg was a political filmmaker who wanted to tell stories about ordinary people and also show the beauty and wonder that exists in the world often letting his characters experience a piece of music or a painting. Not being afraid to use a lot of film stock Widerberg would do retake after retake just to get that slight


Likely suffering from bipolar disorder, caused several issues. The most extreme example of which has to be the 1974 film *Fimpen*|*The Butt*, where he pushed the sound engineers to constantly redo the mix, causing one of them to go to hospital for heart problems. The soundmix took so long to complete that when the curtains were hoisted on the première the mix wasn't finished; the final scenes were still being worked on. The film started as the finalised reels were rushed from the studio escorted by police to the projectionist, however it worked, the reels made it in time and the audience didn't notice a thing.


In 1996 he founded *Lilla filmfestivalen*|*The small filmfestival* a more intimate filmfestival that takes places in one cinema, seminars and dialogues with invited guests.


On the 1st of May 1997 Bo Widerberg died of abdominal cancer, several books and four children.



**Further Reading/Main source**: *Höggradigt jävla excentrisk - en biografi över Bo Widerberg*|*Highly fucking eccentric - a biography of Bo Widerberg* - Mårten Blomkvist (2011); unfortunately an English release seems unlikely. However you can bug [the author on twitter](https://twitter.com/Filmdoktorn) if you want to.





### **Notable Works**


##


**Kvartert Korpen | Raven's End** (1963|[IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057237/)|[WIKI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven's_End))


Drawing on his own childhood experiences Widerberg tells the story of an aspiring working-class writer in Malmö, it's easy to see why some regard this as the greatest Swedish film of all time.


**Elvira Madigan** (1967|[IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061620/)|[WIKI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\Elvira_Madigan_(film\)))



Based on the real life of Danish tightrope walker Elvira Madigan and her affair with Swedish cavalry officer Sixten Sparre



**Ådalen 31**(1969|[IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065261/)|[WIKI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adalen_31))


Also based on real events Ådalen 31 takes place in the Swedish district of Ådalen during a major strike in 1931



**Mannen på Taket | The Man on the Roof** (1976|[IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074857/)|[WIKI]
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_on_the_Roof))


This is the granddaddy of Swedish crime-thrillers and it has yet to be surpassed, well acted and with an intriguing (if straightforward) plot. However it's the characters who makes this adaption of the novel *The Abominable Man* by Sjöwall and Wahlöö stand out; they truly feel like distinct persons with their own ideas and motivations.



**Availability**: To the best of my knowledge only Elvira Madigan and Mannen på Taket have received English editions (and in the case of Mannen på Taket


### **His legacy**


##


Despite leaving quite the mark on Swedish cinema Widerbergs influence pales to that of Bergman

And to some degree the tremendous success of *Mannen på Taket* is to blame for the 30+ films based on the same characters (most of which have been utterly awful)


However *Lilla filmfestivalen* instituted the Bo Widerberg Fellowship in 1997 and it has been given to some of the most vibrant and exciting talent that Sweden can muster. So with some luck we may soon have another eccentric giving another injection of the much needed energy that a lot of Swedish films lack.

1361661834.0,193qt3,What happened to the good Hollywood adventure and mystery movies? ,,55,7,18,"Hello.

I've been re-watching a few golden-era movies, or whether the ""simple mystery-adventure movie"" just doesn't attract a modern audience. 

It seems to me that today's Hollywood movies are too strictly separated into categories. You have the ""action movie"" category, but to me the elongated action scenes make the movies boring, and there's never time to explore the interesting bits of the premise.

A lot of the good movies that have come out since the early 90s have had quite different story structures than what was before. I'm thinking of movies by directors like Tim Burton, although they were themselves no doubt influenced by earlier movies.

Recent programs such as The Wire, and Band of Brothers have, as far as depth and realism goes, broken a lot of new ground in quite a short time.

There are a few programs I would say rival great films such as The Godfather, Blade Runner, Citizen Kane in terms of innovation and depth.

It's about a kid (Ryan Gosling) that tells his shrink (Ewen McGreggor) he's going to kill himself on his 21st birthday. The plot revolves around the few days until this date and the Ewen's attempts to find and help Ryan. As the day draws closer Ewen starts losing his grip on reality; the same things happen twice

One other reason I love this though is for it's attention to detail. There are many very subliminal changes throughout the film that you really don't notice the first time watching or even at all unless it's pointed out but these slight tweaks do a lot for the mood and consistency of the film.

While I don't think that Nicolas Cage has deliberately tried to create a particular persona in his films, I was watching Adaptation the other night, and I couldn't shake the idea that his performance as Charlie/Donald Kaufman was good but also that it was just him doing Nic Cage. I feel the same way about Leaving Las Vegas and Matchstick Men, that the merit of his performance is in the conformity of those characters and their situations to Cage's over-the-top acting. Even though Cage does put a tremendous amount of energy into creating those characters, it feels weird because you could just as easily put moments from those films into the ""Cage loses his shit"" videos. Devoid of context, Cage doing Charlie Kaufman becomes very continuous with performances that are more frequently mined for 'Nic Cage' moments. The only movies that I've seen where he comes across as something entirely different are Raising Arizona and Lord of War. In those movies, he handles the characters in a way that diverges from what he's become known for--he manages not to look like Nic Cage.

These days Cage seems very aware of what people expect from a Nic Cage movie. It seems like his promotion of Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance has centered on it being a Nic Cage movie. This is not to say that he can always save a low-budget popcorn script: three of his films in 2011 were flops. Yet

Does anyone here use this site? Since I started using it 4 years ago it has been indispensable to me. It's extremely useful for keeping a record of all the movies you see and when you see them

First you rate as many movies as your heart desires. Potentially a very long task but very worth it. You can rank from 0-100

Next, you can sort ratings by your closest TCI.

Perhaps the most useful tool of Criticker though is the Probable Score Indicator (PSI). This generates the likely score you will give to any unseen movie

The film database features are also very intuitive and useful. There are a bunch of genres to filter by, or any individual filmmaker. There is also the ability to sort whatever you filter by # of rankings, year in ascending or descending order and most importantly, PSI.

The community is filled with well-watched cinephiles. I'm posting this here to hopefully bring some more in. Whenever you rate a movie you have the option of writing a 500 character max. mini-review. There is a very estimable set of users that regularly post these.

For more to think about, which praises the film and [here](http://erkelzaar.tsudao.com/reviews/H.G.Wells_on_Metropolis%201927.htm) is a contemporary review, by H.G. Wells, which strongly criticizes it. It's worth noting that Ebert seems to be reviewing the 1984 [Moroder version](http://www.morodermetropolisdvd.com/) and Wells almost certainly saw a truncated version that probably ran about 90 minutes.

We're discussing the new [""complete"" version](http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Metropolis-Blu-ray-Brigitte-Helm/dp/B0040QYROK) with a running time of 148 minutes.

I'll try to start us off with a few questions to think about. Please don't feel obligated to answer these

**Some questions:**

* Visually

* What does this movie say politically? Socially? Is it successful in making a statement?

* What does this film say about the act of revolution?

* Fritz Lang later said:

   &gt;The main thesis was Mrs. Von Harbou's, I didn't like the picture – thought it was silly and stupid – then, when I saw the astronauts: what else are they but part of a machine? It's very hard to talk about pictures—should I say now that I like Metropolis because something I have seen in my imagination comes true, when I detested it after it was finished?

   He seems to be very critical

* How does the story of the tower of Babel relate to this film? What religious meaning does this film have?

* How does this film treat women? Why do you think Rotwang chose to have the robot do an erotic dance to show how lifelike it is? How do you feel about the crowd's reaction? What do you think of the contrast between the robot and the ""saintly"" Maria?

* What do you think about the film's portrayal of technology?

* How does this film relate to previous

* How does putting the film into historical perspective change your understanding of it? Are there aspects of the film a modern audience can't ""get"" without understanding the cultural and social issues in the time and place it was made?

* What lesson did you take away from this film? What lesson do you think the film intended?

* How does this film compare with Fritz Lang's other work?

1376576590.0,1kf433,The Use of Realism and Violence in The Hunger Games and Battle Royale,Snes,63,19,31,"There aren't many films in the same genre as wildly different in tone as *The Hunger Games* (2012) directed by Gary Ross and *Battle Royale* (2000) directed by Kinji Fukasuka, while the violence of *The Hunger Games* is less poignant while attempting to be realistic because the characters it portrays are not believable.

*Battle Royale's* children all know each other from the beginning, its effect is very strong because these characters are believable and the moral consequences of murder are never fully forgotten as the film goes on.

How are the characters in *Battle Royale* believable though?  I particularly like how the characters act as immature as children toward their peers.  A great example of this is a scene a little over a third into the film in which Mitsuko, who was stolen by Mitsuko.  The talk quickly divulges back into class dynamics with Mitsuko, a villain in the film, crying out “I've had it, why does everybody gang up on me.  What did I do?”  Something in my experience with children is especially true.  They talk like this, blame each other quick, and question “Why does everybody ____ to me” instead of facing their own mistakes.

While the violence in this scene and the rest of the film are dramatically and ridiculously over the top, did I kill him?”  Shuya is very concerned with whether or not he committed murder, as are many characters in film.  This scene is constantly referred back to in the film because Shuya's childlike innocence is at stake and he is worried he is tainted due to possibly having murdered someone by accident.  These idea make the death of characters have more depth due to the consequences seeming more real.  These characters seem more real, fully developed, and mutli-faceted than characters in *The Hunger Games*.

So what makes *The Hunger Games* characters unbelievable?  Now while I understand that the narrative is set in a dystopian society and the plot tries to cover this up by saying that certain children “train” to be in *The Hunger Games*, Katniss, appear to be one-sided, boring characters who are almost solely just mindless killing machines.

About half way through the movie “the games” start and we are introduced to violence on a grand scale.  The children are in a circle and at the center of the circle are weapons

While this violence in a vacuum is more effective at invoking emotion that the cartoony violence of *Battle Royale*, but the film engages (in my opinion) with emotional manipulation to make her death effective rather than flushing out her character.  Rue is not a complex character like Mitsuko (who may I remind you is a villain) but instead Rue is just some girl who happens to be nice towards the main character.

Rue's death is poignant because she is sung a lullaby as she dies, and a quasi-rebellion happens in her district but if we had all the same information we have about Rue and she just got blown up by a landmine and nothing else happened we as an audience would barely bat an eye.  Inevitably she is just another face in the crowd for Katniss to get through to complete the games.  Mostly all characters act like this in *The Hunger Games* thus while the violence is “realistic” and filled with powerful images, it inevitably falls flat because the characters are forgettable.

Thus, and complex than those of *The Hunger Games*.

So yesterday I finished watching Primer for the second time after doing quite a bit of reading into fan theories and explanations of the film and decided to look into how the movie was crafted in a production-sense. 

So the first thing I'd like to discuss is it is known that Carruth used 35mm film to storyboard the shots out but shot the film itself on Super 16 mm film with a shooting ratio of 2:1. 
And my question is this: Why do you think Carruth chose to use such shoddy film for this movie, like whipping out a fancy DSLR and shooting Primer. Would the movie be as good if it were shot on a DSLR?

How was he so successful with the production of this film? Is Sundance really something that can launch a no body into the ""game""?

As you may be aware

&gt;Though stylistically, the approach is satirical, and indicates an adversarial attitude toward television from a dying movie studio that has refused to adapt to the times (MGM). The effects of television herein are deleterious and hysterical. In Videodrome, television creates opportunities for physical change, a New Flesh arises, evincing a kind of paranoid futurism. In both cases, television ushers in a new stage of humanity

The movie doesn't look like it was made in 1999. So much so that an opening title has to reassure you it takes place in the 90s. It looks more like Taxi Driver than anything Scorsese made in that time. It's both horribly unpleasant to look at, whip pans, and receding hairlines, and I loved it.

Where the film doesn't quite work for me is on a narrative level. And while it might be tempting to throw the blame on screenwriter Paul Schraeder, Arquette's character falls completely flat and as a result the film sort of does as well. Her relationship with Cage's character is clearly intended to be the emotional bedrock of the story, but as that fails (due to Arquette's humdrum performance) the film's forced to rely on the thrills of Cage's job and Scorsese's camera tricks to make up for this. Which, while it is entertaining, is ultimately empty and gets old after a while.

Unable to tame their passion

A mere synopsis goes no way to describing the depth and ambition of this film. A study of tyranny and evil demonstrated in an unflinchingly brutal drama and presented in a wildly imaginative alternate reality, the cavernous sets have a strong feeling of the stage – heightened by the eccentric costumes (designed by Jean Paul Gaultier, no less) that fall somewhere between 70’s London, Elizabethan England and the distant future. It may sound incredibly superficial but writer/director Peter Greenaway has delivered enough weight to ensure the style doesn’t overawe the subject. Released in 1988 it can be read as a satire on Thatcher’s Britain, or a broader portrait of oppression and the power of evil – the interpretation is left to the audience. Predominantly playing as a domestic drama about lust and abuse, it is so well written and performed it can be enjoyed as such - the depth is there for those who wish to see it. 

Michael Gambon is electric as the bigoted, initially a far quieter performance, is no less impressive, making the remarkable transformation from meek wife to sexual, hard edged woman filled with carnal desire and hate. Both roles are delivered with such solid conviction and boldness it is impossible not to be captivated by their interplay.

The raw intensity and electrified feeling of a live performance is almost impossible to portray on the screen, bizarre and ferociously original piece of cinema – this will be entertaining and relevant for as long as brutality and injustice exist.

1365869844.0,1c9vh4,Why did so many people miss the central conceit of the film Room 237?,mi-16evil,63,20,28,"I just watched the great documentary/essay Room 237 last night. What struck me though when looking through reviews of the film, then why would the filmmakers continuously cut and chop the reviews together in a way that gives no full time for explanation for any one theorist? Why would the filmmakers never show us the faces of the theorists which would have allowed us to better appreciate who was talking when (I kept getting the Native American genocide and the Holocaust genocide theorists mixed up)? I fell this is because the point of the film is not to say ""here is the hidden meaning of The Shining"" but rather to say ""here is WHY these people feel there is hidden meaning in The Shining"".

What I appreciated so much about Room 237 is the way it forces you to live the same kind of life these theorists live and to see the film in the same way. The editing slows down each important frame

Think about it this way. If the film was done in a similar way about 9/11 conspiracy theorists, yet five different people can see the same image and come up with wildly different ideas about it's meaning. I feel the same would be true of my hypothetical 9/11 conspiracy doc. To me that film wouldn't argue that ""This is what really happened"" but would rather argue ""how can five people see the same undoctored footage a thousand times over a see something entirely different from each other""? 

I feel bad because I absolutely never want to say ""you didn't like this film because you didn't get it"" but it's hard for me not to argue that filmmaker intent is being grossly lost on many who have seen this film. I also don't want to argue that the film is somehow a perfect gem that should never be hated. It's views are very opaque and the editing often felt incredibly random on the kinds of subjects it wanted to focus on. Because of that there isn't much of a conclusion but thankfully there's an interesting enough climax to give the film a slight feeling of closure. I do love the film

So what do you think? Am I wrong that the filmmakers did want to explore the real meaning of The Shining? Is the film more about the act of seeing (as I claim it is) or is it more about the act of understanding (as many others think it is)? Is the film even any good?

An episode of Scooby-Doo as directed by Mario Bava? Any of the above will do for this hallucinatory head trip about a schoolgirl who travels with six classmates to her ailing aunt’s creaky country home and comes face-to-face with evil spirits, and other ghoulish visions, all realized by Obayashi via mattes, animation, and collage effects. Equally absurd and nightmarish, House might have been beamed to Earth from some other planet.

* I felt no emotion whatsoever towards any character in the film.
* Watching a town spiral into chaos is riveting.
* Letting the camera roll on for ages can be fantastic. Actually I'm reminded of another

Tarr's direction is unique, constantly imagining the man behind the camera. More 'ooh how on earth did he pull this off?' rather than 'what's happening here?'. It's not a criticism of the film though since having scenes last as long as they do gives the viewer plenty of time to ponder these things.

What I'd rather talk about instead, and to me, this is where Persona succeeded like no other film I've seen before: it challenges the viewers senses. I have always found that with Bergman's films I need to put in an extra bit of attention and focus, but this film sucked me in straight from the start, and those 85 minutes went by as if they were 5.

As the story progresses, ladies and gentlemen, is where Ingmar Bergman shows his true colours. Rather than have you watch the character's descent from an outside point of view, he brings you straight into her condition, as if to have you experience the torments that she is going through. The film loses all structure, and the narrative becomes blurry and confusing, but at this point you don't even care any more. In fact, at this point you've forgotten you're even watching a movie in the first place. The camera work in this last hour shines out so much it might even succeed in making you think you've lost your mind..

I really like his movies, although I haven't watched it in a few years, only seeing it once.

The Wrestler is such a great little character driven movie, so it already had me in that regard.

Requiem for a Dream is one of those movies that shook me up when I saw it back in high school a few years ago. Sure, but seeing people's dreams blossom for a little bit and then crash and burn is a really tragic narrative that I can't help but feel for. But the filmmaking on display is what got to me. Very rarely had I seen a movie where the craft was so damn captivating. Some other movies that do this for me are Goodfellas, The Passion of Joan of Arc, A Clockwork Orange, Children of Men, Persona, and I Am Cuba. Aronofsky just pulls every trick out of his filmmaking hat to create this portrait of addicting and abuse in these people's lives and I just love that creativity. 

Editing in modern movies seems (in most cases) to do nothing for the film, using all kinds of techniques. This is the movie that I feel is Aronofsky's best, at least until I see Noah.

I haven't seen much of Lynch, although I wouldn't argue is the greatest TV show ever.

Blue Velvet is one of the darkest films I have seen. The surreal portrayal of an underground group of criminals, that explores the horror and imagination of something that couldn't possibly exist. 

The encounters between all of the characters are all memorable and fantastic. The dialogue between Jeffrey and Sandy is just downright entertaining to listen to, almost as if the actors were reading dryly from the script they had just remembered, but it eventually becomes engrossing and real.

The suspense is all so gripping. The main character just goes deeper and deeper into this mystery and it becomes a mystery thriller in dream land.

The setting of events (I'm mostly talking about the apartment) is incredibly odd. There's just something

1371232215.0,1gcnl6,What role does gender play in movies nowadays?,homokomplex,63,22,43,"I recently re-watched watched one of my favourite movies; ""The Killing"" by Stanley Kubrick. Since it was my first noir-film it changed the way of me watching a movie with stereotypes of a man and woman

The movie contains a couple of men who are about to make ""the perfect crime"". The main characters wife is a so-called ""femme fatale"", have a role of the bad guy. This role is represented in almost every noir-film made.

The femme fatale is more than often a woman who cheats on her husband or tries to get the money, but if the man is killed then it would be weird for the wife to be the murderer.

This leads me to the question i've been thinking about; what role does the gender play in movies today.

I know that women are usually judged by their looks and not acting skill, the main character falls in love with a woman who then appears to fake her love for her own winnings. This was a common practise in the earlier days of movie-making. The woman there has a specific role to fulfill and therefore she is a not only a character, but a critical part of the plot.

If we take the movie Drive (which i personally love). The woman there is a vulnerable woman with a child and a husband in jail. Her role is pretty big, but this is really common.

This topic was brought up by me watching The Killing and Swedens ridiculous gender debate. So my question is how does women affect the movies? How do you think the course of women in film have progressed? We have got a strong role by the not so good-looking Jodie Foster in Silence of the Lambs

I found the film to be a good watch and after watching it for a second time (the first time was a couple months after its release) I get the feeling there could have been more to it. I get the feeling Diablo Cody should have directed the film herself. The script for the movie is great, and bringing the best performance from Charlize, Patton and the rest, it feels like a 'second-hand' film. He sets up shots that look good but ultimately feel detached from what's happening on screen. Something which has happened because, although he is invested in the material, he didn't write it himself and thus can't bring the story to its full potential. Reitman seems more of a producer than director to me, I like his other films (specifically Juno) but all have detached quality where he is a serviceable director.

For all intents and purposes, the marketing for the film was atrocious. The tagline for the film was ""From the Director of *Superbad*"" which was very misleading. It seemed like viewers were expecting *Superbad 2* with the same raunchy humor as its predecessor. These expectations seemed to leave a sour taste in the minds of viewers; they didn't necessarily dislike *Adventureland* but were really just expecting something different.

To me, *Ferris Bueller's Day Off*, etc.) that has been released in recent memory. The film coincidentally takes place in the 1980's (when director Greg Mottola had worked in an amusement park), but it seemed very evident to me that this decision was more calculated and could quite possibly have been made to correspond with Hughes. [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObZ3yBzNKKQ) brief scene really captures the essence of the film (no spoilers). The humor is much more subdued than *Superbad* and seems to have a much more plausible set of characters and dilemmas as well. I think Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg give great performances, although nothing too noteworthy. SNL castmembers Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader steal the show though, but appear very infrequently in the film.

I'm interested to hear what members of this sub think of this film. I'm not expecting others to find this film as fascinating and enjoyable as I do, the depiction of life as an amusement park worker is spot on and definitely worth the watch for that. Furthermore, I do find the subject or theme of young people trying to overcome the increasing difficulties of life to be very thought provoking and something everyone can relate to.

In the canon of Kubrick movies I tend to view this film as a lesser member.  By no means a bad movie

Because the best performances are in the first half of the movie.  Vincent D'Onofrio as Private Pyle and Lee Ermey as the drill sergeant deliver with characters you believe inside and out.  

Ermey

D'Onofrio is equally believable as a man who had no business being in the marine corps.  There are multiple cringe-worthy moments where the viewer is struck by how utterly ""outside"" of things Leonard is.

After seeing this movie for the fourth or fifth time I've drawn another conclusion: the original score isn't great.  A little heavy on the synthesizer to be considered timeless...

The parallel between the opening scene of Said's face before he tags the gendarmerie's van and the final scene of Said's face as he hear's the gunshot was something I missed the first time. It's like innocence lost. 

I found Hubert's story to be the most gut wrenching. He realizes that a life of crime is not the way to get out of the cité, the gym, was destroyed by the raw anger of the youth (represented by Vinz). Hubert spends the whole film arguing with Vinz about Vinz's plan to kill a cop, which Hubert realizes is a futile expression of pent up anger. Even though Hubert suspects Vinz had a hand in burning down the gym during the riots, he tries to help him and reason with him. Hubert recognizes that Vinz only wants to prove himself, but disagrees with the way he goes about doing it, as evident in the scene with the skinhead.

The worst part is that all three characters are fucked in the end. Vinz is dead. Hubert is either dead or going to prison (sucks for his family) and Said lost two friends and likely also lost the ability to hope for change to actually come around.

In mainstream American cinema (under the umbrella of which I include a lot of ""indie"" cinema, to say the least.

Even in films where African-Americans are a major part of the story, et cetera. While there are exceptions such as the acting career of Will Smith (has played a multitude of character types and is pretty much a guarantee that a film will be a box office smash) and the film *Precious*, which was wildly successful (earned six times its original budget), they are still often exceptions to the rule; for most people, modern black cinema begins and ends with the works of Tyler Perry, which themselves have become a formulaic ""brand"" that seem to have morphed into movies ""only black people like"".

------------------------------------------

In Lars von Trier's documentary *The Five Obstructions*, von Trier sets certain injunctions on the process (for example, each shot can only be half-a-second long). In the second remake, Leth is ordered to shoot the film in 'the most depressing place on earth', and thus chooses an area of Mumbai where the level of poverty has resulted in its inhabitants being reduced to beggary and prostitution, perfectly fulfilling the morbid criteria. Part of the narrative involves Leth sitting at an outdoor dining table set up in the middle of the street, surrounded by curious onlookers (many of whom are half-starved children), but it is an incredibly provocative piece of cinema that has always stayed with me.


Few of us, in that situation, enjoy our meal with such callous indifference to the overt suffering around us. Yet there is no moral distinction between gorging on these extravagant delicacies in the centre of Mumbai's red light district or in the privacy of your own home. The suffering is still there. All that's changed is your physical proximity in relation to it. It's more distant, it isn't as immediate, but that fact remains.

My suggestion for choosing the films we watch and discuss each week is that we find a list of the 100 or 50 ""best directors"" and watch a film by a different one each week. [Here's](http://www.digitaldreamdoor.com/pages/movie-pages/movie_directors.html) just one example of such a list. I suggest we make our own list of directors to work from and order it by voting.

Each week we could make a thread where we list all the films of that week's director and vote on which one we'd like to watch. The most upvoted film is the one we watch and discuss. Nothing would stop ancillary discussions of the director's other films as well.

This would be helpful in multiple ways because it would essentially let us know what movies by that director the community likes best

This would not only get everyone watching films they might not otherwise see, and invite users to become more educated on films as a whole.

So

**Edit:** After reading all the comments and all the awesome suggestions

What if we used a list of this subreddit's favorite directors (it can be longer than 100) and then **randomly** selected one every week to watch a movie by? The random selection would help eliminate some of the bias (like saintandre was talking about). We'd still vote on the movie by them

Alternatively (or even in addition to the by-the-director thing) we could have a monthly theme (like timconradinc and deadilyduplicate's suggestion). The theme could be just about *anything* eg: film's the 40's, Gay/lesbian films, silent films, female directors, etc etc.(Salamosam suggested something similar to this as well). I suggest that if we do this we have a discussion on what the theme should be with the most upvoted suggestion becoming that month's theme. We then could have another discussion about what films we should watch that fall under that theme.

We could even do *both* methods and alternate weeks i.e. one week with a director as the theme

So

1374981156.0,1j74bl,Blue Jasmine (dir. Woody Allen),huntersburroughs,47,9,14,"Woody Allen's films have always dealt with neurotic people going through the anxieties that life has thrown at them. He's become a master at it, he's created another neurotic that I'd rank among the best character's he's written.

Jasmine is wrecked after her Ponzi scheming millionaire husband goes down, who has problems of her own. Allen's script uses this to craft a story about people trying to take control of their lives, for better or for worse, and coming to terms how much control they actually have over things. Jasmine can't control her public ramblings and descents into her traumatic marriage. She needs a job, wants to go back to school and ultimately heal her broken mind, albeit with some alcohol and Xanax thrown in. 

It sounds depressing, even Louis C.K. in his small role. Bobby Cannavale's character might be in the running for Worst Haircut of All Fucking Time, but he humanizes what could have easily been a stereotypical blue collar grease monkey. And Andrew Dice Clay is good, too! Yay for the Diceman! But Blanchett is the star of the show, and shows us the flighty, hoity-toity, pre downfall Jasmine with as much conviction as the post downfall, giving us a full performance and creating a character I'll remember for quite sometime.  My favorite performance of the year so far.

The movie is well shot, naturally keeping a certain pace to the scenes while putting us right in the mix with the characters. There's a particular shot with Jasmine and a dentist, who she's gotten a receptionist job from, that is filmed in one long take, lasting easily for a few minutes as it pans and adjusts to the characters, maintaining a sense of unease and awkwardness that you would get in a scene with a bunch of cuts. Woody Allen has perfected these types scenes with intricate blocking and framing, so it shouldn't come as a surprise, especially when compared to other filmmakers. 

This is a great character study, as a lot of people have said, but really only on a framework level. And borrowing from Tennessee Williams is hardly a bad thing. I'd rank Woody Allen in the top 5 American screenwriters of all time, because I think his writing, when on point, is as good as anybodies. Sure, his movies have their flaws, especially his newer stuff. His recent work might not approach ""classic"" Woody Allen levels

I'm sure many of you have scene this but I'd still like to have a discussion on it. I think Gilliam raises some good points, especially when it comes to Kubrick but at the same time Spielberg's knowledge and command of motion picture language is reviled by few filmmakers today. There is something wonderfully charming about a Spielbergian film and at the same time there is something largely unsatisfying. For me, it's what Gilliam expressed. Everything is resolved neatly and completely. I think certain films of Spielberg's could have benefitted from losing his ""sentimental"" touch. What if Schindler's list hard a Brazil type ending? Surely that would be more fitting for a subject such as the holocaust.

At the same time maybe we do need someone like Spielberg to comfort us. To tell us everything is going to be okay. His films are loved by young children for these reason especially. Spielberg films are like a nightlight. They can be surrounded by darkness like Saving Private Ryan but there is always that tiny light of hope.

While SPielberg is far from my favorite filmmaker and while I find myself agreeing largely with Gilliam I've never fully bought into the hate lopped onto him by people like Goddard (I'm not saying he isn't a well respected director but the man does receive his fair share of criticism).

As a filmmaker, Harry Potter 5-8). Both are relatively young directors who took the reigns late in a series and gave their franchises their respective voices. But unlike Harry Potter, which is rich in mythology and symbolism, the first two Fast films are not very good. Rob Cohen's ""The Fast and The Furious"" is essentially a more ludicrous(no pun intended) version of ""Point Break"" with somehow even more stilted acting. It also gave us such dialogue gems as ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time"" and ""It doesn't matter if you win by an inch or a mile, winning's winning."" I honestly don't remember much about John Singleton's ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" beyond its amazing title, but most fans and critics would agree that it's by far the worst of the series.

Enter Justin Lin with ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift."" Gone are both Paul Walker and Vinny D, yet Lin knows exactly how stupid it as and how to take it seriously enough. Though I couldn't tell you any of the character's names (apart from Han, who's the fucking coolest) or recite a single line of dialogue from the movie, I dare you not to enjoy a scene like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3MAmVpAbEo).

But Fast Five is where the series really starts to click. The initial premise of the secret underground world of drag racing is forgotten and in its place we get a fun heist movie that just happens to involve a lot of cars. Also by adding The Rock (who's essentially playing a roided out Javert) and bring back Han (who's the fucking coolest) the series gains some much needed charisma.

From here it would be easy for the series to devolve into a mishmash of absurd set pieces and over the top action, Paul Walker can tow a safe through downtown brazil and we as the audience buy it. Compare that to a relatively ""realistic"" scene from [2 Fast 2 Furious](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCb_6mO6CmE). Terrible, right? Sorry you had to see that, but I needed to make my point. Here, have a nice [Fast Five palate cleaner](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQEfEeBR3-M).

There's a lot more I could talk about regarding the series put the last point I'd want to bring up is how the series manages to stay fresh by changing its genre from movie to movie. More specifically when you look closely, and Furious Six is basically just ""Mission Impossible"" with cars. The big question I have is: What movie will Fast 7 be?

Now I know this film was controversial 40 years ago and I've only just watched it, and the only [other thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/w0a1r/sam_peckinpahs_straw_dogs_one_of_the_most_widely/) I found on the film in TrueFilm has [very little](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/w0a1r/sam_peckinpahs_straw_dogs_one_of_the_most_widely/c59jvh9) mention of it.

I should mention that having looked at wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_Dogs_(1971_film)#Censorship)

I would describe the rape as a centrepiece to the film and I found it genuinely disturbing, that were not really addressed (if it all) in the rest of the film. Particularly it was clear to me (and the BBFC in 1999) that Amy came to enjoy being raped after initially resisting to some extent, and only really reacted with horror when the second man was about to rape her. I would say this raises 'questions' about whether a woman may enjoy rape, except the film didn't really continue with it is a question, and this kind of leaves it as more of a statement which is: women enjoy sex, even if they might think they don't. I think it can also be said that the scene was filmed in an 'erotic' way, which is difficult to explain, and she refuses

This is all compounded with the fact that the other female character, which is never explained but is implied to be some sort of sexual violence. Together these two female characters seem to suggest a really unpleasant attitude towards women from Peckinpah. Do you think that is unreasonable?

It's not so much that I think that films can't be used to ask the question of whether a rape might be enjoyed in some way

** Inception is Christian Allegory **

Inception starts with a shot of the false children building castles on the beach. It ends with the real children building a castle ""on the cliff"". This is a curious contrast and a strange line of dialogue to choose to close a film. It is a reference to the parable of the wise and foolish builders (Matthew 7.24) which serves to establish Cobb's journey as a ""leap of faith"".

There is plenty of evidence that Inception is a film about death

There is far too much supporting evidence for me to cram into this quick write-up, general paternal imagery (note the mirrored subplot involving Fischer's alienation from and reconciliation with his father), Nolan's selective and meaningful use of blasphemy and/or clearly biblical terminology (""genesis of an idea"", etc.), all of the architecture and creation stuff, and of course the names of the characters. Some of this stuff is quite subtle, but most is frankly just hanging out there waiting for people to notice.

Moving on, but rather because ""you don't believe in anything anymore."" Cobb's rejection of her also takes the otherwise curious form of an affirmation in the objective existence of his real children ""up above"".

So the ending is a puzzle, passes through judgment and the forgiveness of sins (at immigration) and then ""returns to the garden"" where he is reunited with his father and his ""real"" children (who are named after two biblical apostles). And the spinning top? It was a crutch of faith throughout the film (it belonged to Mal) and is notable at the end for the way Cobb ignores it.

1356567708.0,15hqk0,Skyfall Review. Thoughts? (Orientalism),Improvcommodore,48,11,20,"Orientalism and the British Empire in Skyfall
 
One of the newer advertisements for James Bond 007: Skyfall quoted a New York Times review saying“BEST. BOND. EVER.”  The quote was dispersed between shots of Daniel Craig running through dirty urban bazaars and suavely entering a decadent Southeast Asian gambling hall in a tuxedo.  It’s been fifty years since Bond first hit the silver screen with hokey villains and disguised gadgets for espionage.  Bond 23 enters the conundrum of a progressing modernity lacking room for the old ways of the British Empire.  What makes this Bond film one of the best yet isn’t its adaptation to the modern world.  The movie conquers with a stoic and unchanging James Bond in a classic Bond film.


With a nod to Britain’s imperial history, have refused to accept no longer exists.  The first situation has Bond sitting in front of Joseph Turner’s 1838 The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last Berth to be broken up symbolically showing that Bond is no longer a soldier fit for duty in the modern era. The painting also suggests that Great Britain is stuck in an intermediary period, confused by expansive international growth over which they have little to no control.  The Temeraire was a man-of-war, second in command to Admiral Nelson’s H.M.S. Victory at the Battle of Trafalgar, a naval battle that subsequently defeated Napoleon’s rule of the waves and provided England the strength to claim victory over France.  Once the war ended, industrialism and the age of steam arrived with all its urban sprawl and anonymity.  The painting shows the mighty Temeraire tugged toward destruction by a small steamboat.  The large wooden ship is useless in the new era.  Mendez uses the painting to overtly demonstrate Bond’s age and old ways as outdated. There is a subtle undertone that the same is true for Britain’s view of the world and their place in it.  In the film, MI-6 has just suffered a terrorist attack and the department is infiltrated and slowly being killed off by an unknown and unnamed villain.


The British government suffers terrorist blow after terrorist blow, James sets out to countries around the world (mostly former colonies of the British Empire) to track down evil.  He chases henchman through sprawling urban poverty, a perverted view of what has come of England’s guiding hand forced to depart from its colonies.  It is a view from the eyes of the imperial age, a view that sees the colonized as “underdeveloped” or “Third World”, monikers of the empire that are no longer applicable in our modern era.  This is why Bond fails.  If it is not sprawling poverty of ex-colonies that the viewer sees, it is the decadence of the exotic “Other”, a position taken by Orientalism, and he cannot find his villain in the extravagance of a Macau gambling house so filled with decadence that I half-expected a Grande Odalisque to be smoking an opium pipe in the corner next to the Komodo Dragons.  For Bond to succeed


When we, we are thrust straight back into the world of the British Empire.  Bond meets Silva, an ex-British Secret Agent much like himself.  Silva was once under M’s command, the Bond before Bond. A previous Temeraire.  Silva and Bond are similar in every aspect.  They are agents betrayed and left for dead by their governments and matriarchal figure.  In a metaphor, Silva describes his grandmother having an island where his grandmother used to play sadistic games with the rats, making them fight over food just to make them fight each other for survival.  Mendez sets up this fraternal relationship to expose the horrific correlation caused by the horrors of colonialism that England visited upon the world during their imperial reign.  Bond is also from an island, has a queen mother who used to colonize lands and in a sense, England’s very first territorial expansion. James Bond and Silva are both colonized individuals turned against one another

  
The only aspects of our hero and villain that set them apart are their placements in the colonial structure.  Bond is from Great Britain, and as we find out later in the film, comes from aristocratic wealth and was trained at Oxford.  Bond is the stereotype of the colonizing citizen even though his history is Scottish.  Silva is the colonized intellectual, the “other” as nineteenth century Orientalism would define him.  Silva, played by Javier Bardem, must be a British citizen to have been an operative yet Silva has a ""foreign"" last name and a ""foreign"" accent.  He is a colonized citizen, not of English birth and therefore not truly one of empire even though citizenship is supposed to extend to the colonized.  His highlighted blond hair makes his race and ethnicity ambiguous to the viewer when matched with his speech.  At one point in the film, but also has a heterosexual sex worker in his employ. Therefore


Mendez’s second use of British fine arts masterpieces from the mid-nineteenth century arrives in a courtroom scene of British MP’s harassing M over her tactics to find our villain, I place them here to refresh your memory:
 
“Though much is taken
We are not now that strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven
One equal temper of heroic hearts
Made weak by time and fate
To strive, and not to yield.”
 
In the film, a reciprocating event of the colonized upon the colonizer.  In a moment where Mendez could have forced England to react and adapt to the modern world, the righteous indignation of acts of terrorism ignites the flame of British nationalism in James bond.  England is no longer the attacker but the attacked.  The film ends with a final battle at Bond’s family estate of Skyfall in the Scottish Highlands.  Silva comes to kill both his metaphorical brother James and his matriarch, M.  To do so, Silva must lay siege to an old castle-manor.  After Bond has won and M is dead by no fault of our hero, the film ends with the world righted once again.  Rather than adapting to the modern world, Mendez seems to say that British Imperialism will out.  Bond’s former female partner in the field introduces herself as “Moneypenny”, to say that the tough work of killing and dying should be left to men.  Bond walks into the office of the new “M”
Although this ending disturbed me as I walked out of the theater, like the old days.”  The old quote “Men want to be him and women want to be with him” was created for this 007.  This 007 is not anonymous or indefinable, nor has he ever cared to be.  He is the arrogant James Bond, and he tells the world with pride.  Mendez’s Skyfall reminds us of the power of the individual.  The hero's greatest qualities of loyalty, duty, and honor stay true to the very end.  The movie is, simply put, but there is only one James Bond.  And that is why this ranks as one of the best Bond films ever made.  As long as James Bond is around; there will always be an England

2. The humiliating or terrifying experience that results in the character springing up in bed gasping. These too appear consistent with the real world and are believable to the audience until we see the character awakening.

What I've noticed is the similarities to the real world almost make it impossible to tell that what we are seeing is in fact a dream. That to me seems unrealistic as the dream world is much more unpredictable. The most realistic interpretation of a dream I've seen was a completely unlikely place: Romy and Michele's High School Reunion. Now this movie was not a classic by any means

It starts out normally

She enters the hall dubbed 'The Crystal Room'- which features school pictures and other party decorations. Romy's hair is also different. Michele has a few brief conversations before deciding to leave where she is hit by a limo. The hit itself is played off as physical comedy and she stands up completely fine. Also similar to a real dream.

Later as another character seems to disappear after he jumps out through the sun roof. Michele then re-enters the banquet hall

It's not necessarily the greatest film of all time, or even the greatest film I have ever seen, but I was able to *connect* on a level that I have not experienced prior.

The setting was fantastic and unique.  And the film itself presented me with questions that particularly interested me.  I wanted to know the motivation behind each character's actions, especially Terry's.  Multiple times throughout I thought to myself ""I know what the right thing to do is, but how would I do it?

1345584486.0,ylo1o,Greenaway: the most important and forgotten director of the last 30 years,jargsmooth,44,4,14,"First I will respond to the criticisms of Greenaway. People are turned off by his work as being too quirky/naval gazing.. I actually find PG's work to have very emotional undercurrents... underneath the technical bravado he expresses characters at the total mercy of their surroundings

Emotionally, betrayed and humiliated in the most casual of ways, usually in upper class social dwellings. One of his favorite plots involves femme fatales who trap the protagonist through pregnancy (in Drowning by Numbers there are three of those)

There is real pain and drama underneath his technical mastery

Technically, layered, quirky compositions. Anderson doesn't even know why he does that, but Greenaway uses it to contrast the chaos of what is happening (very Kubrick-esque). His work is constantly straddling the paradox of chaos and anarchy, and a structured, ordered universe. Greenaway is the sadistic yet bemused god of his film world. 

When I mentioned PG's stories being Kafka-esque, symmetrical and 'architectural' tracking shots and images (his work is very '3-D') (check out Drowning by Numbers, and Belly of an Architect). Sometimes it gives you a frame similar to theater, sometimes his camera has a life of its own and steals the viewer's attention. Yet people mistake this as being distant. To me it reflects a brilliant and always curious mind at work. The Baby of Macon is probably his meta-masterpiece for its use of camera alone. 

I feel I have said a lot without saying enough, I can confidently say he is one of the last film masters and the most under appreciated director. 

I think people are too intimidated by his work. I would say to just go at it with the knowledge that it is all tongue in cheek, never made to win awards, never made for any other reason than the exploration of meta filmmaking.

Ernest Hemingway believed that when writing a story

""If a writer of prose knows enough of what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader

There are many styles of writing, ""I'm just the pilot, I do this."" or ""He's just the engineer, why would he do that?"". An expositional indicator to the audience of who that character is supposed to be, but never why and never with evidence other then the line of dialog.

This on-the-nose characterization feels very off when contrasted with the grand ideas about life

The ideas I ask myself about the Supermen and their experiments and how this could be an Answer far outweigh the sometimes sloppily written characters. It wasn't until the oh-so-obvious sex scene that I even picked up on the non-existent growth of the characters. Not to bag on Lindeloff, three, sometimes even one trait and then only exemplifies that narrow spectrum of emotions and reactions throughout the rest of the film resulting in non-growing characters.
The rebel Map Guy is just a rebel. He has a mohawk and face tattoos. The Charlize Theron character is a by-the-books cold hearted bitch

But we should also not forget that Jon Spaihts of ""The Darkest Hour"" - one of the worst scripts of last year - was attached to the writing credits as well. The obviousness of studio meddling in an attempt to shoehorn in a franchise was the greatest question presented to me by Prometheus. It wasn't until I learned of Spaihts involvement that it made more sense. I can almost see the studio meeting with Ridley... ""Say that Lindeloff fella is a swell guy and all - and a great writer - but we'd like to give you some extra help with our guy Spaihts. He won't meddle at all. He'll just make sure our main characters come out alive and off into space by the end for another film.""

The reason I made this post was a response to all the negativity I'm seeing for this film. I believe the problem lies in the writing of the characters

1323775362.0,navz0,Is 'The Tree of Life' a possible companion/contrast piece to '2001: A Space Odyssey'? ,Nixon74,47,11,28,"I just watched the Tree Of Life for the first time today

To me (obviously there are a multitude of different interpretations) both films deal with the idea of a higher power and the afterlife in a very similar yet completely contrasting manner.

In 2001 the surreal aspects of the film come from what man does not fully understand, an object of a seemingly higher power (or being at least).

 The 'afterlife' is explored through the last 30 minutes  of the film through Dave's journey after he comes in contact with the Monolith

The Monolith is shown to be a higher power, if not guiding us but by no means creating us. 2001 seems to present a more 'scientific' angle to the issue.

Now contrast this with Tree of Life, as mentioned in the beginning of the film all things are certain other then the actions of yourself for which you must choose a path. 

In comparison 2001 supports mans appetite for exploration and knowledge of what he does not know while Tree of Life supports the living of life to the most righteous and fullest extent with what is available.

I want to point to the middle of this movie as the best depiction of childhood I have come across. The editing and the cinematography come together to put you into the head of the eldest son in a way that captures the confusion and frustration of that time without being belittling to the character.

 The sensuousness of the film helps to put us into the subjective state of childhood. The vastness of space and time that is so beautifully depicted bring us back to the time we first encounter mortality and creation. *It all works together so seamlessly.*

And then it goes to shit. 

A movie that had built its strength on the awe of the hear and now switches to a closing scene that is dripping with symbolism of an afterlife.

1372140463.0,1h0tvl,Let's have a serious discussion about A Serbian Film (2010).,Al_Scarface_Capone,70,32,27,"*A Serbian Film* is one of those films that pretty much everyone seems to know about

I watched it today and feel that it is honestly one of the most misunderstood films that I have ever seen. I will try to address this issue in stages, then conclude my thoughts by addressing meaning. 

Let me start by laying out three important definitions I will be referring back to throughout this write-up. I’m sure not everyone will agree with them, I will define a snuff film as a work designed solely to endorse humanity’s most sadistic urge to watch others endure unimaginable pain. I know the traditional definition of snuff requires that it be unstaged, but the term applies just as well to staged scenes for the purposes of this discussion. 

So let’s start with the content of *A Serbian FIlm*, played both for very dark laughs (I point you towards the scene where the main character leaps through a window and another character exclaims “Our film just jumped out a window!”), and as a nod to audiences that the director is in on the ridiculousness of it all. This is the point where it is important to mention the plot at least briefly.

*A Serbian Film* is about a semi-retired porn star, as well as the entire Serbian victim culture that has a developed as a result of the nation’s recent history. What starts as a relatively conventional set of sex scenes quickly devolve into various disturbing acts of extreme depravity and violence. Not surprisingly, the line between Milo’s life and the film he’s making starts to blur and everything collapses in on itself. 

So, and Porn doesn’t seem a bit familiar, it should. And this, I feel, is where the film moves beyond the limitations of its content. I feel that *A Serbian Film* is intended to play as the film that the director in the film is making. What you see on screen, of course, is quite clearly staged, but the director and actors do their best to make it seem anything but.

It is important here to briefly discuss the technical filmmaking behind *A Serbian Film*. In short, and every aspect of the film feels controlled and fleshed out. His direction feels like Lynch meets Kubrick by way of Takashi Miike. The cinematography is similarly diverse and rewarding, featuring a number of absolutely sumptuous shots. The acting is also excellent, especially on the part of Srdjan Todorovic who plays Milo. He is as believable as a loving father as he is as an animalistic brute, reflecting just enough of the other in each situation. Even the blood and gore effects are expertly done, on the same level as something you would expect in a film by Noe or Takashi. 

Why, plays itself as pure trash? Spasojevic could have, if he had made just about any other film, guaranteed himself a career any young film maker could only dream of, based on the talent he displays here. The rest of the team could have moved beyond the confines of working in a market such as Serbia. But they didn't make a different movie, they made *A Serbian Film*.

The brilliant technique on display here lies at the heart of the potential meaning behind *A Serbian Film*. Of course, this suggests that this entire write up is for naught and *A Serbian Film* is a well made, self indulgent snuff film which uses its more or less villain to communicate its central message. The other potential suggestion of this internal statement is that *A Serbian Film* is about a hell of alot more than just Serbia. Instead, it is a statement on our fetishization of violence passed off as art, a sort of *Natural Born Killers* as porn film: by embracing everything it purports to criticize, *A Serbian Film* goes beyond the limits of true satire and enters that strange state between trash and art. If I had to sum up my reading of the film’s message in one sentence it would be this: “As a society, we accept bizarre violence and victimization as art just because it is the only way we can feel anything beyond self pity

Its time to look back to those words I defined earlier. There are two easy criticisms to make of *A Serbian Film* that would seem to contradict the meaning that I just gave. The first is that the film is well made pornography. This is the easier of the two criticisms to refute as *A Serbian Film* does not meet the first requirement of pornography: the way the sex scenes are shot, consensual scene between Milo and his wife, is uncomfortable and more focused on characters than actions. The other criticism, that the film is a high end staged snuff film, is much harder to refute. Its a start to point out the fact that little of the violence occurs on-screen, but this isn't, in itself

The real answer as to why *A Serbian Film* is more than a snuff film lies in the structure and plot. Early on, plot and character are everything. The cinematography, the direction, the editing, they all highlight the plot and characters, while shying away for the violence. Notice here the cinematographer's obsession with characters’ faces, especially during scenes of sex and violence. Going back to our *Jaws* metaphor, rather than just showing a bunch of shark based carnage, the violence, in the loving technique that went into the film

I saw Nicolas Winding Refn's latest film today and saw that there was no discussion thread for it in r/truefilm, maybe) hate it. I liked the film. 
It's definately not Drive 2, but a step towards Refn's previous movies, especially Valhalla Rising. I guess you could say it's an art film. 
The cinematography and camera work in the film were incredible. Every single shot was gorgeous and carefully composed
Music in the film was great too. Drive was known for its soundtrack full of 80s sounding synth pop
As for performances, reminding me a bit of the Driver in Drive. Kristin Scott Thomas gave an amazing performance as Julian's (Freudian) mother, and Vithaya Pansringarm was chilling as the main antagonist. Even though the performances were terrific, I felt many of the character's were a bit underdeveloped. Julian, especially, felt very distant and his true self and motives were a little vague. I still enjoyed watching the characters on screen, though. 
I think I need to see the film at least one more time before I can talk further about the symbolism and themes in the film. One of the themes in the film, but also fight and defeat (and then ultimately become) God. I suppose Pansringarm's justice-dealing cop was a sort God in human form type of guy. 
There were also heavy themes of Freudian ideas on sexuality and aggression
I suppose the main issue with the film was that it was too much style and too little substance, and I guess for many the film will be a little too artsy and may seem pretentious even. 
I would very much like to hear others' opinions on the film and discuss it further.

Certainly the anti-romance film is not a new genre as one of the greatest examples of it, which is probably the finest aggregate of the Best of the 2000s lists, you'll notice that the only two films on there that are primarily focused on consummated romances are Amelie and WALL-E. Again both are radically differen from what we consider to be classical film romances, but the tropes are still present. Amelie features a clever twist on the stereotypical romantic quest; one where the lover leave clues leading to her. What makes WALL-E's romance so great is that it uses classical storytelling techniques of Hollywood musicals and silent comedies to achieve a believable romance between the two main characters.

Basically, it is also a vital tool in today's industry for simply filling in the blanks. CGI allows directors to make an empty room with a green screen seem like NYC, seamlessly to the point where most people don't even notice. It also allows directors to create shots that would be impossible to achieve practically. Take the shot from ""Zodiac"" for example, the camera follows the car from an aerial perspective and then drops into the car. Basically, it would allow directors to do what they want. Imagine the epic films of David Lean or Stanley Kubrick. Now imagine the visuals theses directors could achieve with these tools.



On the other hand, leading to less elaborate sets and more green-screening? Less on-location shoots? Imagine if Carpenter's The Thing were done today? (You don't really have to, actually). Without the practical effects, I'd argue that film isn't nearly as effective. Had CGI not been in its infancy when Jurassic Park came out, we may not have had the incredible effects we have now. Spielberg was forced to use it sparingly, due to its cost and the fact that it didn't look great a lot of the time, and so we got a perfect mix of animatronics and CGI which lead to a beautiful mix

In a large segment of A Personal Journey Through American Cinema
[You can watch it here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnzB_vx9PgU)

First and foremost, right? Well, anyone who knows Scorsese's significance in the Hollywood system knows that he has ultimate power on what films he does and *who* publishes them. Obviously money is not an issue. I forgot since when, but I remember reading somewhere that he's been funding most of his movies entirely for the longest time. I think the act of him picking a children's channel company is a pretty obvious indicator that he wanted this film to go to children, the newer generation that won't grow up with anything but digital projection and 3D and HD and so on.

I'm gonna level with you here. Hugo is not direct with a lot of the film commentary until the later half. As previously noted, the meta commentary stretches throughout the film.

The whole entire first portion of the film is to me just a sloppy wet kiss to old film from the early 20th century. The type of films Hugo and Isabelle are watching are the type of films that Scorsese emulates. It's not complete Tarantino rip-off fest; he's not taking any glory for himself here, the very film the kids see in the theater. Even when he doesn't directly borrow, we are shown some moments from Hugo's perspective that are very reminiscent of old film, such as the recurring sequence with Uncle Dursely and that woman with the dog. I could easily see the being a preexisting flick from the early 20th century. There are other moments that pop up that have a silly old film feel to them as well, but I haven't seen the film in a while so I can't recall them all.

And Hugo watches them from different windows inside the clock, coming of age, etc. Hugo observes all these events from inside a clock. It's almost like he's *watching several old films in a theater*. And it's no surprise either that he has a fascination with film due to his father. 

The path to the strict lay out of the film meta commentary in the second half is laid out by the Automaton. It represents the wonder of an illusion. Even though they build it and it functions properly, is still a mystery that leads them to the George Milies stuff. Film is a pretty simple thing. Even to this day 100 years after the invention began, it remains to be 24 photographs run through a machine every second and everyone knows it. Furthermore, the content we watch on the screen is really a bundle of tricks being used collectively. But even though we know this, the tricks are still powerful, and film still affects us. That's this automaton thing. It's just a symbol of many in the film standing for this idea that there's a wonder to an illusion even if we know the trick.

You have the theater and the action and silliness, like when she almost gets trampled in the middle of public. I feel this is an important aspect to the film because the idealistic girl with romantic adventurous ideas gets trampled by people in a busy train station and they don't even look down. They are going to their jobs or home or somewhere far. They are not having adventures, and this is not an adventure. I think that clear distinction for the characters is meant to kind of lay the law down on recklessness. Film can't take you everywhere even if it can make you want to go. This just emphasizes the illusion aspect to film even more.

That's all I'm willing to muster up right now. In summary, nor does it undermine the very nature of the movie being about film and its magic. Scorsese smuggled it all in because he's one of the biggest aficionados of film and is considered the patriarch of American cinema. Changing to digital photography is a big deal for him and his fans and even cinema itself because he's such a prominent figure in cinema. He's 70, he's growing older into a new generation of film making, and he'll be damned before he lets the magic of film die out. So he made this film in order to preserve that magic that he has become a wizard of, a magician.

Next I will discuss **The Adventures of Tintin**

The Adventures of Tintin was a wonderful film. It's obviously a love project to these older adventures that inspired Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson to make wonderful films of fantasy and adventure.

One thing I've noted about Nickelodeon Pictures in 2011 is that they both got two fantastic directors who have ultimate control over production and distribution to make films *for* children and film makers of a newer generation in the age of digital photography and 3D. They are Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. I believe that Tintin is similarly commenting on the film industry

Throughout the entire film, Jaws and Hook for instance, are dropped constantly as Tintin solves this mystery. At first I saw them as playful homages, but as I read more and more into it (to be honest, I was a little high watching this film), I started seeing patterns and a pretty silly theory developed in my head that the whole film is a story of Spielberg passing on his role in cinema to Peter Jackson. Though I don't believe this is 100% valid, I still believe that it prompts some good discussion about the future of cinema, I did some looking around on the internet and found that I'm not alone on a lot of this.

One thing I noticed is that the main antagonist, [looks incredibly like Steven Spielberg.](http://www.soundonsight.org/the-adventures-of-tintin-spielberg-brings-his-signature-blend-of-actionadventure-and-humor/steven-spielberg-and-sakharine/) Likewise, [Captain Haddock, who eventually regains the rightful ownership of his ancestor's treasure from Sakharine, bears a remarkable resemblance to Peter Jackson as well.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfkywS5YAzM) Both produced the film, WETA Workshops did the entire thing, and Andy Serkis, plays the character that looks like Peter Jackson.

The way I see it, the film really is breaking the 5th wall by showing Peter Jackson watching a bunch of Spielberg classics. He sees the ship battles like Hook, an overlook of a city that looks like India (Temple of Doom), gets in a scuffle in a middle eastern marketplace filled with baskets and military tents (Raiders), and they are chased by a tank, which falls off a small cliff, in a motorcycle with a side pod (The Last Crusade). Tintin swims through the water towards some people he means to subdue at one point and his hair looks like a shark fin (Jaws). At one point, which made me think of [Spartacus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartacus_(film)

I think that in the similar way that Scorsese made a film about the magic of illusion and the importance of film itself, and he himself has stated last year that he's bored with action and could ""make one [action film] in my sleep"". I think this film is special because it could very well be his last action film. He's passing the helm to Peter Jackson, who has made efforts to innovate filmmaking technology and become the trailblazer for film's future. Best of all, take a wild guess who's directing the next Tintin sequel instead of Spielberg? Even if all this stuff isn't really intentional or valid, I think it brought a personal, enlightened appreciation for this underrated, overlooked film to me.

1372628940.0,1hdxyg,King Kong (1933) and the Visceral Effects of Visual Effects,AstonMartin_007,40,6,14,"So I just saw the Blu-ray of *King Kong*; having not seen the film in a *very* long time, and we're talking 1933 here. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it seemed to flow.

For those of us who need a refresher

* Golden Gate Bridge begins construction
* Adolf Hitler becomes Chancellor
* FDR becomes President
* DJIA has largest all-time 1-day percentage gain
* Prohibition repealed
* FM radio patented

The story is pretty straightforward: Entrepreneurial director Carl Denham grabs starving Ann Darrow off the streets of New York and sails to South East Asia to film the greatest movie ever. Along the way, and captured by Kong, who prefers his ladies scantily clad. The crew comes across dinosaurs and Kong himself while trying to rescue her and face brutal deaths. Driscoll saves Ann, and Kong pursues them to the coast where he's knocked out with gas bombs. Cut back to Manhattan, and Kong's on display for New York society at $20 a seat (In 1933! That's ~$360 today!!). Despite the latest in chrome steel chain technology, Kong escapes and terrifies the locals. Horny Kong, who clearly hasn't masturbated in a while, hurling away brunettes in search of blonde Darrow (roughly the same story will be told 25 years later in *Vertigo*). He climbs to the top of the Empire State Building, that equates to a fall time of roughly ~11secs and a terminal velocity of ~110mph.

It's not a story that I think warrants or benefits from allegorization, but it's not exactly cut-and-dry because Kong is plainly depicted sympathetically at the end. Whether the filmmakers were aware of this angle is unknown, but they certainly don't dwell on it, preferring to keep the pace up during the brisk 100min runtime. Peter Jackson would rectify that fault 72 years later.

All levity aside, it is theoretically possible to render anything in CGI and get close to perfection. The subtler CGI shots can already cross the Uncanny Valley threshold to photorealism; even in TV there are many CGI shots that many wouldn't suspect are fake.

The VFX of *King Kong* and other heavy FX films is not subtle. It's not trying to hide at all, as evidenced by box office figures, it seems to me that the emotional impact of these films hasn't really kept up with the technological advances. It's pretty common to hear ""It's all real, no CGI!"" when someone recommends older films like *Lawrence of Arabia* and *2001: A Space Odyssey*. In recent times, *Inception* was praised for the rotating hallway (which really isn't that special in the FX realm). I think it's fairly plain that even in the digital age, audiences do have a special appreciation for practical effects.

I don't think the issue is really analog vs digital. Both have their pros and cons, they never have been and they rely on suspension of disbelief, imagery, and sound to create an emotional response. To put it harshly, audiences pay good money to be lied to for a few hours, but there's something about the way most heavy CGI films are handled nowadays where the artificiality of it is basically shoved in your face. Particularly with the constant superhero blockbusters being output, more and more it seems like the flimsy story is an excuse to show off computer renderings, however I think it's fair to say that at this time

It's also possible that people have an intrinsic forgiveness towards practical effects that doesn't apply to CGI. With practical effects, seeing *Vertigo* the first time, the dolly zoom totally stunned me, and there are some shots in *2001* using multiple perspectives that invite the viewer to wonder: ""*How in hell is this possible?*"" In the analog age, the solutions were sometimes ingeniously intricate or deceptively simple, but in the digital age, audiences usually just answer ""computers"" and think nothing of it. This is not to denigrate CGI artists, and right now the job has quite frankly become something of a thankless task. However

Really, complex, and subjective that I'd really rather not have it. I just find it illuminating that an 80-year old puppet made of rubber and rabbit fur that stood 18-24in tall can still entertain in a time when the latest CGI can be yawn-inducing. Another curiosity: You frequently hear, and see, actors having difficulty on green screen stages reacting to non-existent props, but somehow they had no difficulty getting an entire theater and whole crowds to react to Kong's intimidation and escape in 1933. This is directly referenced in the film when Denham tests Darrow's reactions to an invisible menace on board the ship. More food for thought, I guess.

Getting back to *King Kong*, cut to New York (and people have a problem with Scottie on the rooftop...*pssh*). He's climbing the tallest building in the World, how do we...Airplanes! This is a film that knows exactly how long it's welcome, does everything it needs to and clocks out on time. 

*King Kong* serves as the basis for every monster movie since, the filmmakers allow and exploit a degree of empathy, identification, and even humor, something that's hard to imagine with other monsters, like *Jaws* for example. The menacing, uncaringly destructive monster is so familiar in cinema that *King Kong* almost seems like a fresh response to the trope

Robert Armstrong's Denham bristles with enthusiasm and panache. Special mention to Max Steiner, a common weakness amongst even the most prestigious film essays, is basically denying themselves half the experience.

1366036885.0,1ce31y,"The remarkable tale of Travis Bickle, John Hinkley Jnr, Rupert Pupkin et al.",SuperCoolCinema,42,5, but what an insane story it is

In a nutshell...

In the early 1970s, A STATEMENT of my manhood for the world to see’.  On 15th May 1972 Bremer shot presidential candidate George Wallace five times at a political rally, leaving Wallace paralysed.

After his conviction for attempted murder, out of work and living in his car. An unhealthy obsession with guns and pornography was born out of this period of intense isolation. 

Over the course of seven days, many people connected with its largely sympathetic portrayal of existential rage and social isolation, John Hinkley Jnr being one of them. 

On 30th March 1981, and instead it was Travis Bickle who was held up as the guilty party. Hinkley’s defence claimed that the already disturbed individual ‘absorbed the identity of Travis Bickle’ having watched Taxi Driver repeatedly, adopting Travis’s dress code and becoming obsessed with Jody Foster.

Scorsese had already started working on The King of Comedy at the time of Reagan’s shooting and it was in production when Taxi Driver was screened in court (with special attention being paid to the scene in which  Travis Bickle stalks presidential nominee Charles Palantine at a political rally) 
and blamed for turning Hinkley into an assassin. 

Scorsese had said very little publicly on the Hinkley matter and instead seemed to channel his feelings into The King of Comedy.  The theme of an isolated man lifting his personality from media output is established before the opening credits had rolled

This must be the biggest gamble of Scorsese's career

I have a few questions that may not have answers

Also

In the final moments of the film we watch the actual drug deal go down. In the beginning of this scene we see the drugs get hidden in the wall of an old building

Here's where is gets strange for me. Charnier rides in a car to leave the deal, but if this is the case then I'm still reaching for some meaning in this final scene. 

I also keep wondering if Charnier could have gone back for the drugs

Then finally there's that gunshot at the end of the film. This I read about. Friedkin apparently added this for the sake of adding it, kind of childish in my opinion, but I can't get too upset, the film was damn entertaining.

"" The Three Faces of Asami: i.e. it's all psychological
Sorry about the lateness of this post. I didn't even hear about this movie when it first came out. I only discovered it recently, I also read all 21 pages of reviews about it over at www.IMDB.com (Internet Movie Data Base). And while the majority of people enjoyed it, so to speak; very few of them even came close to understanding its message. So since no one else saw it this way, I may be way off base. But it makes perfect sense to me; so I'm glad to share it.

* * * * *

Spoiler Warning: This isn't a review of the film for those who haven't seen it yet. It's an analysis of the film's psychological meanings for those who have seen it already. Spoilers ahead: You've been warned.

* * * * *


The film doesn't EVER shows us the real Asami. Neither the submissive girl at the beginning

It helps in understanding the meaning of the film if you first understand the symbols used.
Consuming Alcohol represents having a blurred view of reality: The two men are drinking when they discuss their skewed, showing that even that view of her is not accurate.
Feet represent adultery or fornication through the metaphor of ""running around"". Removing the feet then represents preventing infidelity.
A Tongue represents telling lies
An Ear represents listening to someone; a missing ear
A Finger represents touching; typically physical or sexual abuse

As the film opens we see Aoyama completely lost in his emotions due to the death of his wife. It is only the appearance of his son that brings him back to stability. In effect

He does not recognize that women have the same feelings that men have. This is indicated by the secretary who keeps announcing that she is leaving to get married, if she has any, are insignificant. Likewise, in his discussion with his best friend about what kind of girl to choose, he likens it to picking out a car.

After he has been widowed for seven years, even though it should be the other way around. This is shown when the son tells the father to do the dishes and the father complies; when the son has a guest come over and the father gives up his dinner for the guest; and when the son enters the father's room without knocking.

Once he decides to look for a new wife and agrees to the ruse of an audition, even though she's gone. His guilt is growing both from stepping out on his wife and from holding a sham audition.

Although we never get to see the ""real Asami""

When Asami comes into the audition room we cannot see the real her, submissive, properly formal, ""good girl"". During the questions that his best friend Yasuhisa asks, we hear the real girl's answers, but Aoyama isn't paying any attention to them, he is only attentive to his projection. When he finally talks, telling her how wise she is for her age. Her only responses to him are

Each time he calls her or even just thinks about calling her and we see her waiting by the telephone, even before the first resumes arrive, he ""sees"" a girl sitting in her room waiting for him; but at this point she is not yet defined enough to have features, those are put in place only after he sees Asami's photograph. This image of a submissive girl just sitting and waiting for him to summon her is merely another manifestation of his old-fashioned, male-dominant outlook.

After dating a few times they go away for a weekend together. Although the weekend was his idea

Prior to consummating their relationship, figuratively, and reveals to him her scars; and he tells her it doesn't matter. When he had first heard of her abdominal injury he thought it was related to her dancing, so he felt sympathetic; but now that he hears it was a sexual encounter, he starts becoming disillusioned. His image of her begins changing to the opposite of goodness. Both her confession and his own act with her cause a change in his view of her from a perfect Asami to an ""evil Asami"".

Although Asami is young and beautiful, young girl in return.. She's also encouraged to take a chance with Aoyama since he's actively pursuing her. But she has guessed wrong: he is picky and wants a ""good girl"". She had tried to let him know early on by telling him her past in a coded way, by saying she'd been abused and had received an abdominal injury. But he was blinded by his projection of the perfect Asami and didn't comprehend what she was saying. His best friend, however, understood what she meant and so kept trying to dissuade him from the girl.

After they have sex and Aoyama begins dreaming about her admission, he still wants her. However, as his subconscience takes over, he begins examining everything she's told him and the details start coming apart and recombining in a more negative picture. As he thinks of the sexual assault he suspects the dance teacher. The teacher's feet are prominent, symbolizing his debauchery; but they are deformed, showing that his sexual interests are perverted. Aoyama at first imagines an old lecher who has taken advantage of a small child; he crawled between her legs and left her scarred for life. But as he continues to consider this he begins to think that she may not have been so young and helpless after all when it happened. The dance teacher asks him if he has talked to her (tongue), heard her (ear), as he thinks of her employer, which for him signifies lying. He comes to think that everything she has said has been lies and deceptions.

The missing record producer and missing bar madam are two of the pieces he can't make fit. These were just facts thrown into the story to allow for misdirection. We're supposed to think that it's the record producer in the sack and that the bar madam was murdered and dismembered. But actually it's just coincidence that the record producer left town and only because of insufficient detail that he can't find where Asami worked. Aoyama's best friend only says he can't track down the record producer and the bar madam; that doesn't mean anything has happened to them, and a tongue (remember those?). That there are ""three"" fingers is a product of him imagining that she was touched by three people -- her Uncle; her Stepfather; and either her Aunt if we're considering any abuse, or her record producer if it only refers to sexual abuse. Personally I think it refers to the Aunt, and that the record producer had very little involvement with her before leaving town for unknown reasons.

He is also led to question just what it is he is looking for in a woman. A succession of images of different girls attacking him sexually -- an aggressive Asami, innocence, and sexuality.

His changed image of Asami is again indicated by his consumption of alcohol, and submission to another's will. Evil Asami is both the manifestation of his disillusionment with Asami who is now seen as not perfect, and the embodiment of his own guilty conscience which is punishing him for lying and running around, and his attitude towards women.

He comes back to reality momentarily when he wakes up with a start, but before he can figure out what to do she announces that she will accept his marriage proposal. He now feels trapped in a relationship with someone whom he no longer feels to be a perfect partner. So he goes back to sleep and dreams again, trying to find a resolution to his problem.

Prior to their weekend together he had always pictured her in dazzling white clothes and with a submissive demeanor, he began projecting on her an image of wickedness. His imagination put pictures to all of the negative metaphors of his guilty conscience -- telling lies (cut off tongue), tasting pain (syringe), feeling it in his stomach (needles), a playboy that ""runs around"" (cut off feet), searching for beauty and youth (eyes), losing his head, he tries to run and escape; but he is literally tripped up by the sack on the floor. He finally opens it to see what it is and is shocked by what's inside.

The sack represents his own emotional feelings toward Asami. It first appears when he considers calling her for a second date. Initially he is able to keep his emotions under tight control; completely bagged up, he imagines she's deliberately waiting and his emotions jerk; but then she answers and the sack lies still. Each time his emotions grow we see the bag move. Later when he finally opens the bag and releases it we see a tortured man who has been stripped of almost all his humanity, completely enslaved to the whims of this woman no matter how sadistic and evil she may be. He cannot tell lies, or run around, or touch other women. In other words he is emasculated.

He is totally trapped by his emotions and powerless to free himself from this girl, even to the point of being treated like a dog and lapping up her regurgitated lies while she pats him on the head like a pet.

Only after he's realized this do his thoughts turn to his son. His son saved him from emotional helplessness once before, Shigehiko and Asami battle it out in Aoyama's head to see which will prevail. At last Aoyama finds his love for Shigehiko is stronger than his attachment to Asami, thus he is able to break free of her domination.

He had become completely enamored of this girl despite his assertions early on that he was mature enough and smart enough not to be taken in by emotions. But as things progressed, nor even his love for his dead wife were enough to prevent him from getting ensnared once he had decided to have an emotional relationship again. He had been lonely too long. Only his love for his son was strong enough to free him from his false projections and help him become emotionally stable again.

Once he had killed the image of the evil Asami he was able to hear for the third time the conversation from their second date. The first time he heard it, it was colored by his evil image of her, and her family was abusive and hateful; but the third time, he actually heard the real her. And he comes to realize that there is a real person behind his projected images; someone with real feelings, someone just as vulnerable as he. As they had prepared to sleep together, her request that he ""love only her"" was seen by him as her attempt to assert control over him, and his mind rebelled against that. In actuality it was just a plea for him not to hurt her. Finally, he heard their conversation one more time. In the third version he finally comes to understand the meaning of their relationship -- we take a chance, but if they respected each other they could survive.

All the time that he's having the second dream, to seeing that they are also people with their own needs and feelings; and those needs are similar to his own -- the desire for companionship, love, and respect. We don't see what he'll do with her when he wakes up, but we know that he will at last see the ""real Asami"" and will recognize that she's more than just a servant or a pet.""",,False,t5_2szp0,True

However, but before the final scene, the purpose of the film seemed incredibly clear to me: His illness (which I believe he had, either in the form of schizophrenia or something else) caused him to act destructively due to paranoia about a storm coming. Rather than working together with his family or truly seeking help, he let his paranoia build and build until it completely overtook him.

 Woyzeck isn't demonstrative of Herzog's usual style as a filmmaker; it uses long cuts and scenes seem like acts. He's criticized for this decision

 Kinski's interpretation of Woyzeck is perfect. He shows every emotion through his face, at the exact time called for in the script. The oppression of the forces being thrust upon Woyzeck is palpable as each scene unfolds. Feeling along with him is crushing. The final scene, where Woyzeck finally breaks and stabs his wife to death, assaults the viewer. Kinski's face is a mask of pure agony. As I write this I return to that scene, and feel tears starting to form. I may never watch Woyzeck a second time.

1348753318.0,10k9at,The Last Samurai: Massively racist or an insight on being Japanese?,AudibleJello,48,15,22,"So bear with me on this one.

Its really easy to slate 'The Last Samurai' for all its obvious shortcomings. Whenever one of these movies come along, it will be done again. Dance with Wolves, Fern Gully, Pocahontas, Avatar- they are all the same story, but range vastly in quality; plot is not the measure of a film. Its amazing how similar films are actually. But you know this.

Anyway, ingratiating himself, and then become their saviour of sorts is sketchy to say the least. The Last Samurai is very much guilty of this despite what people say. The question of whether it is Katsumoto or Tom Cruise (and I'm calling him Tom Cruise- because thats really what the character is), who is the last samurai is ambiguous, sure, but that in itself is outrageous. Just watch Katsumoto's death scene to see how blatant this American feeling of superiority can be (watch from 04:00). http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZTWCwqmgLc . Tom Cruise's train of thought can be roughly transcribed as ""God, are all these Japs bowing to me or Katsumoto?"" Its about 04:43 that you can see ""What was I thinking, praise me and my glorious white skin."" I only exaggerate a bit.

Despite how absurd it may seem, and the critical reception was far more positive than in anywhere else in the world. So as a Western audience our self-righteous bleating, trying to ""protect"" Japan from Hollywood's modern pseudo-imperialism, falls flat and is a bit ridiculous.

So why do Japan not only tolerate, some stereotypes, some not; duty to country over love for family, a deep seeded love for the emperor that embodies Japan, a national religion that doesn't even recognise the existence of the rest of the world, a country that even now clings on to a sense of ethnic homogeny, and the famous 'asian work ethic' fuelled by the love of their nation. Suddenly, since the war, nazism etc. (I'm coming to my point in a minute).

Japan has had to deal with a very similar sort of post-war guilt as Germany. A guilt that has had Japan terribly insecure regarding its common perception as 'the villain of Asia' from both America and post-imperial Asian countries. This once again is very apparent in American and Chinese cinema- the likes of 'Pearl Harbour', as well as the more forceful power of American occupants, and a changed of constitution- made the expression of Nationalism, the very tool that dragged Japan into a modern power, extraordinarily taboo.

Back to The Last Samurai. It is in fact the very naivety and revolting American-ness of the movie that allowed it to be popular. For one, The film is highly nationalistic- portraying the emperor in a position of power despite the reality of him being merely a figure head. It allowed the Japanese people to connect this nationalism without any sense of guilt. If the film were Japanese, questions would be instantly cast regarding 'what is the political motivation?', subversive and unsettling undertones would be present- corrupting an otherwise pure affirmation of Japanese nationalism.

The rabbit hole goes deeper, and weird; not only unique, but uniquely unique. This gives rise to an obsession of what it means to be Japanese, and a brand of literature referred to as 'Nihonjinron' i.e. The examination of Japanese Identity. Examples of characteristics include, a language that foreigners will never be able to truly speak, Japan as an island country that has an immaculately preserved culture, Japan as a 'groupist' society, the Japanese as having a dichotomy between who they are on the inside and on the outside

The Japanese are not to blame- Nihonjinron is a reaction to Western 'orientalism'- and in fact the Last Samurai is very appropriate in showing that. Orientalism is the western creation of an ""other"" to reaffirm itself. Just as the basic archetype of the movie is- show how awesome the American is by showing how savage or weird or different the [insert an interesting world culture] is. Nihonjinron is the adaption of this image to something that reasserts Japan as something more than a backdrop for an American story. Nihonjinron is very much the assertion that Japan is in fact better than the rest of the world in self-defense- uniquely unique.

The Last Samurai fills this need perfectly- it presents to Japan an image of what it is to be Japanese, and then once again export it to the west. The director definitely researched Nihonjinron as some sort of pre-production, content in ripples, as everyone else, of earlier examples of a false image of Japan, (think 'Chrysanthemum and the Sword' and 'Shogun'). Indeed we have all witnessed the western exotification of Japan, the weeaboos, including the Japanese

I'm not denying the existence of the samurai but in actuality they were a corrupt group- described in actual history as content in their own power, but because it would eradicate their standing in modern society- a guaranteed life of gambling, drinking without having to work. In the movie progress is represented by the progress of war, only slightly manipulative. But In fact not only were the Samurai standing in the way of progression of war, but of education, law, industry, the identity of Japan

The reality of Japan NOW is dire, a young population not getting married and having children, as well as an ageing population. Now, my statistics aren't going to be exact- so look them up, but in 40 years over 40% of the population will be over 65. If they don't decide to go on a mass culling of their elderly- for every 1.7 worker, they 1 old person has to be sustained. That number is going to grow- and won't sustain itself for long.

 For my final point, no more stupid international relations issues- but for a Japanese population that has convinced itself so strongly that what makes its country strong is Nihonjinron, this is difficult to accept- going against the principles of an isolated, homogenous nation. Katsumoto is the Japanese identity- the product of American orientalism, the obstacle of progress, and the subject of admiration from an oblivious Japanese population.

Its a bit sensational- but its funner that way.",,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/10k9at/the_last_samurai_massively_racist_or_an_insight/
1340618144.0,vkdfm,Prometheus - my interpretation - (Xpost from r/movies),Fu_Man_Chu,58,25,49,"I noticed a lot of charts and pictures attempting to illuminate something about this film and most of them seem so far off I felt compelled to offer a counter position.

For starters

The opening scene is a depiction of ""Prometheus"", so that we might be spared. 

This is why there are dead engineers everywhere and why we constantly see recordings of them fleeing for their lives. It is also why the engineer's ship was already programmed to head to earth. ""Prometheus"" stopped them from visiting earth and attacking us with the weaponized organics just in time.

Granted

As for the ""goo"" itself

My additional theory (and this part is a stretch) is that the Engineers represent a notion known as ""Teleological Evolution"". That is to say they represent the idea that evolution is ""going somewhere""; in this film's universe to the engineers. We have their DNA because life is evolving towards them (they are simply us minus the imperfections). This part is a stretch but is something I found thought provoking while watching the film. It also explains why the ""Aliens"" xenomorphs are so bad ass. They are the antithesis of the most highly evolved organisms around.



Note

Edit: I want to add I think this movie is still flawed

- ""I've been on an alien planet for all of 5 minutes... you know what I'm going to do? TAKE OFF MY HELMET! YAY

- ""I'm a biologist but I think it's a good idea to poke at the snake like creature emerging from the black goo. Yes

- ""Oh a large space ship is falling on me. I've seen the schematics

Who is the competitor now? Hollywood is America's dominant cinema, is in essence a niche market. 

I contend that Hollywood's contender, and now everyone is a filmmaker. I can spend 1000 dollars and pick up a movie camera, and make a decent living on youtube if I'm funny enough. Camera's like DSLRs and even the RED make everyone a filmmaker. Literally every middle classer and up can viably make a sleeper sundance hit. I think that this threatens hollywood. Why do we go see their movies for 15 bucks plus popcorn, when I can go on vimeo and watch a pretty damn good ultra low budget indie film?

Did you find it dull or boring? Even if you loved it

I think film exists as one of the greatest of art forms because of its ability to expose more of our senses at once to more fully draw us into a story. When I think of the films I find to be great, mise en scene and music drive the script in such an enticing way. It can be quiet and serene, yet you're engaged as the script goes along and relish in these moments, just as you do in the loud, action-heavy scenes. A delicate balance of eye candy and immersion in dialogue that slowly piques our interest takes you from the start to leaving you in a daze afterwards.

I don't ever want to pigeon-hole myself into a way of thought, convoluted scripts can quickly derail and destroy beautiful filmmaking aesthetics. I found the acting performances to be stellar in the Master, but that alone doesn't mean that I'm interested in what's going on. The script's roadmap was punishing to the overall story IMO, there was never a time where I was hooked into the action enough to wonder what was coming next in the tale.

I need to see it again, I honestly tuned out because I was so unengaged. I used to think the basic three act structure and film formula was annoying, which it can be in the majority of instances. However, I now find that the most successful, thought-provoking films never stop riding the formula backbone, but spiral around it giving us a base to see the beauty of the story. For me, the master failed at providing the foundation necessary to engage in the story.

1356811578.0,15my72,"Today, I watched Life of Pi... (Spoilers!)",kennisaurr,50,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/15my72/today_i_watched_life_of_pi_spoilers/, I was excited to see that it had been adapted into a full-length feature film and was curious to see how closely it compared to the book. I loved the concept of Pi's story

For those of you who have not seen or read the book, a terrible storm occurs and Pi's faith (simultaneously Muslim, Christian, and Hindu) is tested as he loses his family and is forced to survive in a small boat with a Bengal tiger, an orangutan, a hyena, and a zebra. 

Life of Pi is a beautiful example of telling a story visually. Every scene is stunning and vibrant, unnecessary, dull the colors, and give me headaches. However, Lee uses over-the-top 3-D effects sparingly and allows minimal 3-D usage to give the film a more realistic feeling - the entire reason why 3-D was introduced into the cinema to begin with. 

My favorite visual aspect is the way that Lee uses water in the film. The scene where Pi is playing with the bioluminescent phytoplankton is one of my favorite scenes in the entire film for how beautiful and rich the water looked. It has a very ethereal feeling

I loved Pi as a character in the book because he came off as meek, specifically when he is standing and screaming up to the heavens.

On that note, however, I understand that bringing that into a film is very tricky. I would like to have seen Pi's Muslim belief talked about in greater detail. Hinduism was highly emphasized in the India scenes, and Christianity was emphasized on the boat, but I feel that Muslim got left out quite a bit. Pi's handling religions was shown well, though, which I admire because it is my favorite aspect of Pi's personality. He not only tolerates other religions

I enjoyed the addition of the unnamed writer to the film because I felt that it gave Pi an opportunity to explain things that would have taken too long, as whichever side that the viewer believes in is largely dependent on their beliefs. One who believes in a God will believe in the tiger story, where as one who does not will blame Pi's ridiculous story on starvation-induced hallucinations.

Overall, regardless of age, gender, religion, or personal taste. Even as a die-hard thriller fanatic, I found it to be an impeccable story with great visual elements. **9/10.**",,,,

1354425454.0,1450ky,A lot of people are praising 'Silver Linings Playbook.'  Allow me to offer a dissenting opinion.  (Spoilers),worff,75,41,68,"I've talked about this a lot and thought about it a lot over the past few days

The problem with the film, but with a screenplay as flawed as it is, nothing else in the film can go beyond 'good,' resulting in a final product that is mediocre and dull.

Now I've gotten some pretty heavy flack for saying this.  People really seem to enjoy it

Here are the things I thought were problematic:

1. Exposition - Throughout the film, don't tell.**  Every character is guilty of this kind of dialogue, and it's borderline insulting to the intelligence of the audience, who would be able to figure all this stuff out without being led by the hand.

**NOTE: That's not to say that characters can't say what they're feeling.  Obviously, De Niro's little bedside speech was stating the obvious, as was his final line.  These lines were not only obvious to the audience, but to the character he was addressing, as well, making them doubly useless and that much more detrimental to the film.** 

2. Conflict - In damn near all films and literature,* where these four characters begin with pleasantries and end up hating each other.  Or Saura's *La Caza (The Hunt*, when a group of hunters go out as friends and end up hunting each other.  Thousands of years of drama have proven this to be effective and satisfying for an audience -- a slow build of tension and conflict, culminating in a climax that allows a release, and leads to some sort of resolution.  *Silver Linings Playbook* has none of this.  The characters routinely just start yelling at each other, or have outbursts.  The conflict spikes, completely blindsiding the viewer, poorly planned

3. Consequences and Stakes - The film has none of this.  It begins with Bradley Cooper being released from a mental institution on a type of probation, presumably to create some financial stakes, (because he's a gambler), yet the family lives a comfortable suburban life, and there's no evidence of financial hardship.  Nothing to do with medical bills, nothing to do with the fact that Cooper has lost his job and is unemployed for the duration of the film, nothing at all.   Cooper's character has nothing to lose.  His wife was cheating on him, which put him in the mental institution, and taken out a restraining order.  He can't lose her anymore.  Jennifer Lawrence's character pursues him romantically from the moment they first meet, even though a cop character is prominently featured in the film.  (He's always there when the story needs him

4. Dialogue - It's just bad, and the dialogue just doesn't flow right.

5. Characters - The characters haven't been properly developed, which allows for a few laughs, but that's it.  Lawrence's character is eccentric and socially inappropriate, and that's it.  De Niro's character is eccentric and even less developed than his character in *Meet The Parents.*  Chris Tucker is a token black guy whose sole purpose is comic relief and to teach Cooper and Lawrence how to dance with soul.  There are also far too many characters.  In what's supposed to be a small family drama, you have 12 characters.  Cooper, his mother, his father, his father's friend, Cooper's ex-wife

6. Transparency - the film is full of moments that are so clearly engineered by the writer and director to create more 'drama, that game takes place on the same day that Cooper and Lawrence are supposed to compete in a dance competition.  For no reason at all, the bet becomes a double-bet, where the Eagles need to win and Cooper/Lawrence need to score at least a 5 in the competition.  The scene discussing this goes on for so much longer than it should have because it's so unnecessarily convoluted, but the biggest problem is that it's entirely unmotivated, and it's an obvious attempt to add a bit more drama to the final sequence.

7. Bi-Polar Disorder - now what a lot of people are saying is that these poorly written characters are the result of bi-polar disorder.  That they act erratically because of their disease.  I could buy this if the film accurately portrayed bi-polar disorder, quirky ones.  Same can be said of Lawrence.  Her husband died, and she fucked a bunch of co-workers to fill the void, and ended up getting fired.  Depression takes many forms, and it's somewhat understandable.  Her symptoms are also funny and quirky, with a few 'emotional' ones because she's a woman.  Both of their disorders are trivialized to the point that they can be fixed in the span of the two-hour movie.  And in doing so, O'Russell loses his right to have the form of the writing reflect the content of the story (and that shouldn't be done in the script phase to begin with because the audience isn't bi-polar).

The final result is a film that has a bunch of quirky scenes with people acting differently in social situations.  I found no substantial dramatic, and I felt that the film fell flat in every single way.  

And I'm not the only one who doesn't like it.  [David Denby](http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/silver_linings_playbook_russell?currentPage=all) and [Richard Brody](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/movies/2012/11/the-book-on-silver-linings-playbook.html)

There is definitely something I want to make clear right away: the animation is the most beautiful I've seen

While the worlds he creates are enchanting and engaging, and I related in that way, but then the film went in so many different directions that it was a whirlwind of eye candy. I think my main problem can be summed up this way: random quirkiness does not equal depth (that's a problem I have with Amelie and some Wes Andersen films). After me and my friend finished Spirited Away, we first discussed the plot and how sporadic the beats were. I understand that Miyazaki doesn't direct simple yarns, and that he focuses on using ""moodiness as mood"" to engage the viewer in this foreign world, but all I felt during the film was incoherence. It bothered me how the main antagonist of Howl's Moving Castle was tossed aside half-way through, and not a second thought was given to her. Where's the arc? Where's the character development?

Don't misunderstand me... I love surrealist cinema (focus on mood instead of plot), I hear the famous stories of John Lasseter watching his films whenever he is in a creative funk, and becoming magically inspired--and I never felt that.  It's probably because I thrive on emotional arcs for protagonists, and I like everything fitting together nicely.

Some interesting things that I noted:

Antonioni's cinematographical footprint is really unique. For example, so a couple of trees, grass and Thomas can be seen. There is no wind at all, so the trees don't move and the camera also stays still. With only Thomas moving in the shot, it looks like a living picture, rather than a film. 
Shots like this can also be seen in Professione: reporter (The Passenger

The second idea is about the point (SPOILERS), I was waiting for the idea to emerge that the director is trying to amplify. I didn't see anything too powerful until the end, where Thomas throws the ball back to the mimes and then disappears. Later, when thinking about it, I drew some weird line between the somewhat missing idea of the movie, and the plot. Through the plot, the protagonist was trying to solve the mystery of the photograph, the body was missing

If you haven't seen this film and plan on doing so

---


I watched [Leon \(1994\)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110413/) last night on the back of some strong recommendations and reviews

First, it's even more striking. Jean Reno, whilst understated, was good although there was not a huge development: he goes from keeping Mathilda distant to telling her he loves her with no obvious change in character; whether this is down to the script or the acting is up for debate. Gary Oldman was obviously having a lot of fun with his character, and he really hams it up.

The story and concept  was good: an action film with a twist





Now, except for the scene of the sniper training in Central Park. Why set a film in such an iconic setting if you're only going to ignore it? The sense of Leon's isolation in a sprawling metropolis doesn't come across because we don't know he's in this metropolis for most of the film, it's completely ignored.

Secondly, it told you what emotions to feel: this bit's fun because there's an accordion! This bit's sad because there's violins! This bit's cheeky because the music's jaunty! It was telling you rather than showing, it was very poor.

Having previously praised Natalie Portman's performance, other than she watches cartoons. She is an adult character with adult sexuality, and yet she is a 12 year old girl. Now there are interesting films about the sexualisation of children, but this just presented her as an adult and didn't deal with it. Are we just supposed to accept that she wants to have a relationship with Leon? 

The most uncomfortable I felt was during the dress-up scene (which in itself is completely out of place with the rest of the film); her impression of Marilyn Monroe is portrayed as fun and flirty, in essence, a 12 year old kid acting sexy with a late-30s man, and I found that extremely uncomfortable.

My biggest problem was that it doesn't seem to know what kind of film it is: is it an action film with a bit of romance? Is it a romance film with a bit of action? Is it an investigation of the sexuality of children? Is it about a hitman with a soul? All of these threads are present

These are not nobodies making these films, these types of projects have well-respected and famous people working on them.

Lastly, not at home (which provides some great irony that this film will primarily be seen through VOD).

I know Lucas and Spielberg recently said that going to the movies will be like going to Broadway or a professional sporting event with tickets around $50 and internet TV will be the future of smaller projects. I feel like *The Canyons* reinforces that point. Even though it was publicly funded (for the most part)

It's based on an absurd, offensive, full of gratuitous shots of naked bodies...

but it's also probably the smartest movie he's ever made.

Watching it, particularly the one in which Tony Shaloub's character figures out Mark Wahlberg is his kidnapper was pretty well directed. Same goes for the scene where Mark Wahlberg accidentally kills the porn king with the dumbell. I also loved the way the exposition scene with Wahlberg's character was handled.

On the other hand though, gratutitous Miami things I mentioned earlier, but it felt like a grown-up story, and one that showed that maybe, just maybe if he put his mind to it, Bay could create a decent crime thriller. Personally I thought this was a good movie. By no means great, but certainly not what I expected from the man. Anybody else have any thoughts?

My problem is that I felt it was a little forced into the entire movie. Everything that I liked and enjoyed about the movie is clearly there in the final act, yet the overall scene and character development does a feel a little forced and out of place, what I wanted was a little more character development. Am I alone in this, did you think the movie is perfect as is and does not need more?

I wrote this up on my blog

And MASSIVE SPOILER ALERT for everything below.

Upstream Color can be viewed through the directors lens thanks to having witnessed three showings of the film that included Q&amp;A sessions with Shane Carruth.

He seems to think of the science fiction parts of the film as a framing device. Therefore

Shane Carruth made it a point

*The worm, the sampler, and the orchid ladies. From observation of the Q&amp;A, Carruth explained the former triplicate as, again, simply a framing device. He said it was necessary for this thing, whatever thing that's part of the life cycle that links organisms

The latter was explained by their role in the film. The thief is pretty simple at face. He is someone that has benefitted from his knowledge of the linking. He uses this to his advantage to take advantage of seemingly random people he encounters. He serves as the negative use of the link. The orchid ladies are also pretty simple at face. They are an unaware beneficiary of the organism.

I think the most interesting person in the film is the sampler. He's the questionable beneficiary of the story. It's unclear if what he's doing is good or bad. On one side he's knowledgeable and benefitting from the linking by getting these unique windows into people's lives as an observer, when the sampler observes the husband who's wife went to the hospital the keyboard playing is mimicked by the husband as the sampler plays. A final example, the scenes in which the sampler is doing audio sampling are mixed between scenes of Kris and Jeff being awash in the sounds of their daily routines; the sounds are very similar between cuts, perhaps demonstrating the link.

Color comes in to play quite a bit. I believe I heard Carruth or a member of the audience mention something about the color blue being correlated with control. Yellow and orange come up as well and are are referenced in Walden as well. Be sure to check the song titles of the soundtrack as well.

The sound is an entire beast of its own to dissect. I will say that it stands alone quite well. Having walked through Central Park with it coursing through my ears made for its own adventure.

Another thing to note is Kate's false victory at the end. It's absolutely hilarious that she got the wrong man. The sampler was just an observer. The man that really wronged her was the thief; but she has no knowledge of this. Only the audience does. So there she is at the end of the film
The characters are as linked together as the plot is linked to the framing of the scene as the audio is linked to the characters and so forth.",,t5_2szp0,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1cglvu/upstream_color_after_three_viewings_and_qa/

1364840948.0,1bfs62,Watching **bad** film in order to better appreciate good film: Just watched 'The Fourth Kind'. Discuss?,Antiochli,46,14,26,"I am rarely compelled to watch 'bad' movies

The Fourth Kind:

At the outset Mila Jovovich addresses the audience and indicates that the following film is based on true events and that any depicted scene in the feature is based entirely upon video or audio footage, actual video/audio footage will be used during the film to depict the drama unfolding. She than goes on to give a brief synopsis of the drama that will be told.

Immediately, I'm becoming very rapidly biased towards this movie, of which I've seen virtually zero actual film of. Methinks this is not good.

Why in the hell would you attempt to dupe your audience into believing that the film you're presenting to them is not only based on true events, at even a cursory glance, if taken as legitimate, would shake the foundations of not only the religious/supernatural crowd but unquestionably the scientific community at large? The mere fact that the footage, if legitimate, would undoubtedly cause such shock waves, (and yet clearly did not), rather rapidly realizes

A documentary is a documentary: it's about something real in the real world with real people, in a real world pretending to be fake. The Fourth Kind attempts to blend these two narrative styles, giving the viewer a stylized film narrative intercut with documentary style footage purporting to be real, in an attempt to add authenticity to the film narrative. And it absolutely fails. Miserably. 

To me, there's nothing else. The audience is told ""We found these recordings, check 'em out for yourselves."" And that's it, the concept is blitheringly simplistic, and there in lies they're fundamental element of success. Those films don't immediately break down through simple (and logical) analysis, the actors never break the fourth wall, I'm not being presented with a film that at times appears to be as hokey as a 'Lifetime Network' dramatized portrayal. Even though I know those films aren't real, I can completely immerse myself into the narrative and

Conceptually 'The Fourth Kind' seems like it had potential, *as* Mila Jovovich? Mila Jovovich is saying ""Hi, I'm actress Mila Jovovich . . ."" stop right there. Never ever do that, never destroy the audiences invisible wall with the film world and our own. Mila Jovovich is an actor, I'm aware of that, I'm watching a movie; but when the actors attempt to add authenticity by stepping out of their roles inside the film to address the audience it kills the immersion. So from that point on I'm watching a movie where Mila Jovovich is portraying some psychologist who you purport is real and have a fair quantity of 'actual' footage showing her dealing with all the stuff going on in the movie? Anytime Mila Jovovich is in a scene hypnotizing a patient and furthering the plot, you (the filmmakers) are going to split screen and simultaneously show me the 'actual' footage that this now obviously dramatized scene is portraying? How do they expect the audience to be compelled by this? By showing the 'real' and the 'dramatized' I'm inclined to take neither one seriously, or gore, and than evidence of their ensuing madness. You don't attempt to explain to me why

You're sitting there watching Mila Jovovich conducting an interview with a patient under hypnosis and than you split screen that with an interview tape of the exact same thing, something which feels as though it's quite literally calling it's audience a bunch of blithering idiots.

From scanning a number of reviews from Metacritic

I was absolutely floored by a dream sequence in the middle of the film:  Mako, pseudo-Blade Runner, mecha-fantasy aesthetic is suddenly dropped: we are faced with a little ~~Chinese~~ Japanese girl in a blue coat, screaming in terror at the destruction around her.  Until the sea monster rears its head from behind a sky scraper, this scene could plausibly have been on the news covering ~~an earthquake~~ a tsunami (which happened ~~*earlier this year* in China~~ 2 years ago in Fukushima, Japan).   

I am disappointed that US film critics failed to see Pacific Rim as more than a summer blockbuster.  It's like examining The Avengers without acknowledging the terror attacks of 9/11.  As an American, shaky-cam shots of destruction in New York City, even when it is caused by space aliens.  There must be some comparable cultural reaction towards Pacific Rim, because it is a pretty huge hit in China, while Grown Ups 2 beat Pacific Rim at the US box office.  

Looking at those box office numbers, especially when the 'mainstream' US critics seem to have missed the most basic metaphor of the film.  

Where is the best website to find out how a film is received internationally?  I'm guessing there are better review-aggregates than Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes?

1366343302.0,1cnow9,Fitzcarraldo,JoePesciLover,35,7,12,"Just watched this wonderful film. How disadvantaged its reputation is by the circumstances in which it was made- all the discussion of the extreme lengths Herzog went to tends to overshadow the fact that the film itself is an enthralling and often brilliant work of art.

I was startled by how idealistic the film was compared to Herzog's other work, touched by Fitz's passion, lets him into the opera- it's just a nice, sweet moment. It's the character of Fitzcarraldo that sets the film apart; he might have a screw loose, but there's such an innocence and idealism to him that we (and the other characters) admire and go along with him.

How great is Kinski in this? I don't know if it's my favourite performance of his (I find him so touching in Nosferatu- his self-loathing turning to anger in the dinner scene is perfect) but he embodies the character so well. As written he risks being a caricature of an eccentric- as played by Kinski

One thing that struck me is how it never makes hamfisted points about capitalism, and never does any labour himself- he walks around in that white suit like a plantation owner while others bring his dreams to fruition. The relationship between capital and labour is perhaps the whole point, the exploitation of the natives the source of much of the conflict an tension. But the film never devolves into commentary, marxist or neoliberal, on what is happening, something a weaker film certainly would. It asks questions rather than answers them.

The imagery- the ship being raised over the mountain, and I hope you'll forgive the flowery language here (and throughout this whole thing)- unforgettable. Just a beautiful film, that really understands the medium in a way few do.

Fargo has from the first watch amazed me with how elegant and perfect the narrative seems; I can't quite find the word for it. Everything feels driven, but the only comparison that immediately jumps to my mind is Melville of all things, the stark simplicity of plot in Le Cercle Rouge, but there's no stylistic similarity. Perhaps it's because in both, one scene means one thing happening. You can imagine telling the plot of Fargo in a flowchart.

Is the elegance of Fargo's narrative the result of one single factor or the interaction of many? The length is definitely a part of it, it's pure storytelling in a fairytale-ish way. Actually, Night of the Hunter is another film with the same kind of indescribable narrative perfectness, that quality I'm searching so badly for a word for.

I'm a firm believer that shocking visuals can be used in film with tremendous effects (Cronenberg and Hooper for example).  However I also realize that most directors have trouble balancing shock content with coherence as the explicit nature of some films can alienate the viewer and distract from whatever they are supposed to understand from the film.

To clarify:  I have not seen the film because it is not available to me through local libraries or online streaming.  The only access I would have to it is through buying the actual DVD or pirating it online.  I also live with my parents (I'm 19) and this would sort of be a weird thing to have them walk in on me watching... I know that's juvenile but the film sounds pretty fucking sadistic.

I hadn't seen any trailers or commercial.  I hadn't read anything about it.  I just went in with no expectations or preconceptions.  What I saw was a film that both aroused my hope in the future of the crime film

*2 Guns* is a film of modest ambition and in a way, military conspiracy), but manages to do so without the accompanying paranoia.  The trials of the hero are still unbelievable, but kept (mostly) to a manageable human scale.  This is a definite step in the right direction.

Perhaps the film's greatest virtue is it's unselfconsciousness.  The direction is handled, paying little attention to blocking and mise-en-scene.  While it's sad to see a film of possibility handled with so little personality, had it been directed by a self-conscious stylist (a wannabe Tarantino, for instance), it could have easily been rendered an obnoxious bore like *Boondock Saints*.  (How I long for the days of the unselfconscious stylist - guys like Phil Karlson and Joseph H. Lewis who could add brilliant, subtle bits of visual direction to enhance the depth and impact of a film without being showy about it.)  What we get is a pleasingly amiable, if impersonal, material that borrows good bits from *Breaking Bad* and *Justified*, Bill Paxton

The first 3/4th of the film stays within these modest parameters,back-to-back, gun firing partners shot).  You can almost hear the studio executives demanding that the film be ""punched up"".  It is at this point that the film loses all credibility, and disappointingly so because they almost had a good little crime film (albeit a flawed one).

Is it just impossible to make a gritty crime thriller of contained scale and scope in the modern Hollywood system?  Does the demand for explosions and over-the-top action require that all entries in the genre be reduced to stupid shit?  I doesn't take genius to make an interesting crime story

*5CMPS* is, but I've personally enjoyed his other work too. I haven't seen *Garden of Words* yet, but *The Place Promised in Our Early Days* was decent (though not, IMO, as good as the other two), and *Children Who Chase Lost Voices* was a pretty good attempt at a Ghibli movie.

To me, because it was an emotional roller coaster that really showed what Shinkai could do. And I don't think that that style of filmmaking is uniquely Shinkai's (or Japanese), because I might compare his movies (and their style) to the likes of Melancholia and perhaps Tree of Life.

He also uses the ""pillow-shots"" that you can hear [Ebert describe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=_9WEyuMq0Yk#t=275s) more eloquently than I can. In addition to those, is the moment when Chihiro/Sen is putting on her shoes in *Spirited Away* and she taps the tips of her toes on the ground briefly to get a more comfortable fit (or to shake rocks/etc. loose). That kind of thing in animation is really cool to me, because it only gets there through intent. In a live action film, subtle things like that are done instinctively and usually ignored. But in animation, the only way a shot like that gets into the film, is if someone spent a lot of time observing behavior and then took time to illustrate the important, yet little considered actions.

To me

The way I learned it

---------------------

Foreshadowing is direct hints at how future events will play out.

Foreshadowing must *nudge* you. Evil music behind a character's entrance is foreshadowing. Someone entering via shadow hints at his motivations. The examples I've linked to would be considered ""motif"" for the most part.

Foreshadowing can be dialogue ""You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain"" *begs* us to apply it to the whole story. It can be repetition - seeing oranges around death in The Godfather gives us a pattern. Or it can be semiotics - The box of ""Ka-Boom"" cereal in Kill Bill is pretty distracting - ""why'd they name it Ka-Boom?"" it suggests.

Clearly it remains subjective

There is a sequence towards the end of the film where Cheyenne finally manages to exact revenge on the Nazi who had humiliated his estranged father in the Nazi camps. The poetic beauty associated with Cheyenne's revenge not only underlines the true power of Sorrentino's filmmaking genius but also accentuates why most European filmmakers outwit their American counterparts in their ability to deliver strong and meaningful messages that despite the deliberate level of subtlety involved still manage to pack a powerful punch. The movie's slow pace may pose a challenge to some in the early going but the patient viewer will be thoroughly rewarded. 

This Must Be the Place is a testament to Sorrentino's range as a filmmaker. Watching the film makes one wonder whether one is watching only one film or a bunch of different films seamlessly blended into one. Sean Penn is a revelation in the role of Cheyenne

P.S. Another remarkable Sorrentino film to look out for is The Consequences of Love (2004).

For me this is probably my second or third favorite film by Park behind his masterpiece ""Oldboy"" and next to ""Sympathy for Lady Vengeance"". It's his first directed film were he didn't write the script although it's hardly noticeable because the material is practically tailor made to his aesthetic. I thought the film was superb. THe story has the same captivating quality of ""Oldboy"" but what stands out far more in the film is the creepy and ominous overtones in this film. He combines minimalist set dressing with at times almost gothic lighting (all though for the most part he uses a cool color tone but it does have it's gothicish moments) and it really accentuates the looming threat of danger and then of course his cinematography is just as innovative and as inspired as ever.

While all the visual elements are great, despite her nature whereas Uncle Charlie was locked up at an institution. Uncle Charlie developed resentment towards the family. This resentment was exacerbated when India's father refused to let Charlie see India. Strangely it was because Charlie loved the family that he killed India's father. He loved it so much being away from it was torture.

I think theme of envy is very prominent in the film. Charlie envied the attention his younger brother got so he killed him. India's mother envied the attention India got so she resents India in addition to both loving and resenting India's father.

This movie is typical Hollywood copypasta tripe. I felt that the elements in this film would be more at home in a film version of a video game adaptation of the original film. Why is this? 

My impression of the original Thing was that it worked, faceless ruskies.

 The conflicts are very overt and unsatisfying. The characters are flat but this is forgivable since all I care is who's a mutineer and who's a human. This version felt like the mutineer aspect wasn't even in play - sure the thing could become someone but at the first opportunity it would erupt into an alien. There was no guile involved. The aliens seemed more like time-bombs than (an) intelligent foe(s).

I finished the film and thought the only depth that went into making it happened to be coming up with using the title of a far superior product. In a world that relies on consistency in their fast food hamburgers it has long been apparent that the entertainment industry consistently practices the poisoning of a film and then offering it under a trusted label.

1327622822.0,oycua,Thoughts on Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line,Fintann,35,6,18,"When I first saw this film I made it about half hour into it before I got bored and turned it off. I was pretty much watching it from a WW2 history buff angle so I didn't really get that much from it. A few years later I saw it from more of a film lover aspect and while I really liked it more I still didn't get all of it. As of this past year it's become one of my favorite films and I've watched upwards or 10 times. So thought that I'd share some my thoughts on it.  

The main theme that I've notice from this film is the idea of Life and Death and how to function between both of them. This is best seen in Pvt. Witt and his journey in the film. Witt seen as a very kind hearted person, but could be a state of mind. When Witt is surrounded by Japanese troops, he seems to come to a peaceful state of mind and openly accepts his death. His death is then cut to him swimming in the waters with the indigenous tribe he lived at the beginning. It could be argued that this is that 'other world', not heaven but a state of being at peace with mortality. 

A stark contrast from Witt is Sgt. Welsh, is his inability to live with grace and compassion like Witt. As he says to him in their first discussion ""Maybe you'll just see things I'll never see."" Through out the film Welsh and Witt have 4 very important discussions. With each one Welsh comes closer to learning from Witt how to live with grace, and Witt is coming closer to being able to die with grace. The first discussion on the boat has Welsh saying there isn't another world and Witt being somewhat unsure himself. Later on before they take the hill on the island, Welsh shows he understands Witt to some extent and feels bad that he's stuck in the army and this world. While C Company is on their break from the frontline Welsh and Witt have a run-in at a small uncompleted house. Witt asks why it seems like Welsh pretends that he doesn't care about others and acts  Welsh remarks how Witt is ""still believing in the beautiful light?"" and that he's a magician with how he lives with so much focus on the beauty of life. Witt's response to Welsh is how regardless of his coldness, he still sees a spark in him. This alludes to the idea that Witt may be able to help Welsh learn how to live better. However the next time they talk is at Witt's grave. In Welsh's final words to Witt, he ask ""Where's your spark now?""; in which he's not really exclaiming that he's dead, but that Witt's love is gone and with that so his Welsh's chances to become more open and compassionate. The next time we see Welsh he's listening to the new Captain's speech with his helmet clasped tightly and a cynical look to his face. From what can be seen

When looking at the film visually the themes come across through certain elements. Fire comes to represent hope in people at times. Witt is playing with matches in his holding cell

Birds are featured many times in the film, it's laughing at him. Another man sees that same bird, feels the glory, feels something smiling through it."" Welsh is the one that sees nothing but pain, while Witt sees glory. A point that shows Witt embracing the glory of mortality is at the house with Welsh. As they finish speaking the camera focuses in on an empty birdcage with the door wide open. This image is seen before with the flashback to Witt's mother on her death bed reaching to an empty birdcage.

The most striking aspect of the film is it's starkness both in style and in character development. There are no real heroes in this film, but his journey is one of rapid deterioration.  The other protagonist, the shipping company's CEO, becomes more sympathetic as the film goes on, but still spends most of the film trying to find the right price for his employee's lives.  

If I had one issue,  it isn't really the point of the film to explore the intricacies of Somali history or piracy, its about how people react when being held hostage, and the pirates serve their purpose as skinny, unpredictable menaces.

*World War Z* was filmed almost entirely in Glasgow, a place with a film industry that now mushrooms over New York and is rivaling LA. *This Is The End* was filmed in New Orleans, even though the entirety of the narrative takes place in LA. 

---

I think this makes for an interesting discussion and I have a couple of ideas about it. 

1. I think it's inevitable. As long as low labor costs in other countries exist

2. As an LA native who currently works in the film industry here, eventually giving way for studios and production companies to exist in other places. Just look at Louisiana or New Mexico - both places that have successful production companies basically making a monopoly on that area. Although most of the distribution and exhibition is still in LA, I think if production keeps getting pushed to these new places, eventually it will make more business sense to distribute films from there too... 

3. I think we will definitely see this change happen in our lifetimes

---

I know this is an atypical question for this subreddit but I think it also will impact what types of movies will get made in the future. Could *Beasts of the Southern Wild* have gotten made in LA? Could it have survived pre-production if it didn't have Louisianan tax credits floating it's budget? No. I think tax incentives also throw a huge bone to independent filmmakers. Which is awesome if our goal is to take power away from the centralized nature of the studios. Not saying it is necessarily

The acting and character sketches were incredibly perfect. They were lifelike and dove-tailed into one another in just the right way.

To me, and the way that the four girls would - one by one - fall out along the way. When everyone leaves for spring break, and the four are left behind, we seem them framed in the empty corridors of their dormitory; trapped in the bathroom where they pool their insufficient money and discuss how they'll make enough to go to Florida. I kept wondering at what point along the way I would have gotten out, made my exit so to speak: was it when they decided to rob the fast food joint? When they got arrested - or when one got shot? Would I exit before I had to shoot someone myself - or would an exit be forced upon me, as it was on Alien? When *does* spring break end? (seriously, I'm not American and have a pretty hard time figuring out exactly how long ""**spring** break"" lasts)

During roughly the first half of the film, three of them, really - indulged in spring break rites (from beach parties to aimless scootering around) and dragged each other towards bottom, but the extended cutaway montages of the spring break ""dream"" were frankly too drawn out and seemed too exaggerated. 

But then they go to the drug-fueled party

Obviously, Cotty and Faith, but I thought Korine very effectively dismantled this idealized fantasy of spring break as an eternal party. As they get bailed out by Alien, it seemed like focus shifted from spring break itself, to a more stylized, if caricatured, gangsta fantasy of money, symbolic of both the violence the girls - a little too happily - engaged in to get away, but unlike Candy and Brit (and to a lesser extent, it's not so much spiritual as transcendent/transgressive. 

Faith was, considering that she opts out about halfway through, never to be seen again; conversely, I would have liked to have known just a bit more about Candy and Brit pre-spring break.

The film used repetition heavily, but it seemed to me an almost hypnotic experience. The neon-bent sequence at the end looked *amazing*, but for me the visual highlight was the one-take robbery that efficiently build tension (it seemed almost inevitable that they'd be caught), before releasing it in an exhilarating scream.",,False,,False,t3_1aac1y

1. Satan represents indulgence instead of abstinence.
2. Satan represents vital existence instead of spiritual pipe dreams.
3. Satan represents undefiled wisdom instead of hypocritical self-deceit.
4. Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it instead of love wasted on ingrates.
5. Satan represents vengeance instead of turning the other cheek.
6. Satan represents responsibility to the responsible instead of concern for psychic vampires.
7. Satan represents man as just another animal, who, because of his ""divine spiritual and intellectual development"", has become the most vicious animal of all.
8. Satan represents all of the so-called sins, or emotional gratification.
9. Satan has been the best friend the Church has ever had

They seem to be on opposite sides in their approach to life, but there's mutual respect and love.  And Freddie is, quite literally, the best friend that Dodd's church has ever had.

2. Do not tell your troubles to others unless you are sure they want to hear them.
3. When in another's lair
4. If a guest in your lair annoys you
5. Do not make sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal.
6. Do not take that which does not belong to you unless it is a burden to the other person and they cry out to be relieved.
7. Acknowledge the power of magic if you have employed it successfully to obtain your desires. If you deny the power of magic after having called upon it with success

To be sure, and the meaning of The Master is even more obfuscated and ripe for interpretation than TWBB. The themes of the two movies are remarkably similar. Where TWBB was about the tension between religion and a certain animal characteristic within man, namely relentless competition and drive, The Master is about religion's tension with another animalistic human trait: hedonism. Just as Daniel Day Lewis represented pure ambition in TWBB, Joaquin Phoenix assumes a role representing pure hedonism. JP is a drinking, fucking and fighting machine, without purpose or direction. He is scolded repeatedly by Philip Seymour Hoffman's character, as ""an animal who eats its own shit when hungry.""

However, where animalism is the clear victor. First of all, PSH and JP do not hate each other like DDL and Paul Dano did in TWBB, rather, they love each other. Furthermore, the guru himself struggles with his own hedonistic tendencies. At some points he uses his extreme charisma and strangely effective methods for good, genuinely attempting figure out how the mind works so he can heal people. But at others he abuses his power, where Amy Adams gives PSH a handjob over a sink, you won't find it. We never get a solid answer as to whether PSH's character is a charlatan or a genuine master

The main struggle, in easily the most over-the-top intense performance in recent history, maybe ever. It could be criticized as somewhat of an one-sided acting fest, akin to going ""full retard,"" just because it's so unhinged and so extreme that there's little room for complexity. Daniel Day Lewis, Tom Cruise, and Adam Sandler portrayed restrained anger in their respective PTA roles, restraint doesn't stand a chance against the animal within JP's character

However, a love story between JP and PSH. From their initial meeting, where PSH ""processes"" JP, and finishes by saying ""you're the bravest man I've ever met,"" the two are in a torrential whirlwind of ups and downs, embraces and fights. Both struggle with hedonism, and both make strong attempts to become more than mere animals using the civilizing force of spirituality and religion, drinking buddies, to find truth.

The performances of PSH and JP are each so powerful, including both the plot and poor Amy Adams. This could be a criticism, but it works here because that's what the movie is about--that love is so much bigger than everything else that's supposed to be so important, including the very serious quest for spiritual truth.

[SPOILERS FOR THE FILM MENTIONED IN THE TITLE AS WELL AS THE OTHER FILMS THAT I'M ABOUT TO MENTION]

I'd like to start off by listing these films:

[Man Facing Southeast [1986]](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091214/)

[Happy Accidents [2000]](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0208196/?ref_=sr_1)

[Sound of My Voice [2011]](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1748207/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)

[Safety Not Guaranteed [2012]](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1862079/?ref_=sr_1)

I'm not a big fan of many of some of these films as I tend to find them schmaltzy and somewhat predictable.  I never saw **Man Facing Southeast** but as I understand the filmmakers had [sued Gene Brewer (K-Pax's writer) and others involved for plagiarism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-PAX_\(film\)#Plagiarism_lawsuit)

All these films have an almost basic story told through different means. The story being that one person claims to be from another time/another planet and tries to make a connection with a person or people  in the present day which is always initially met with doubt, those being **K-Pax** &amp; **Safety Not Guaranteed**  as those were the two I found to be the most cloying, despite one being ambiguous in it's ending and the other being clear. Whereas the two I did like:  **Sound of My Voice** &amp; **Happy Accidents** also were split between ambiguous and clear endings. Although Happy Accidents also falters to being schmaltzy there was, what I felt, something more genuine to the love story. I realize a lot of Redditors here and in /r/movies loved **Safety Not Guaranteed** I cannot adequately express what it was I disliked about the movie other than it's cheesiness. At first I thought it was the age difference between Mark Duplass' and Aubrey Plaza's characters but it turns out that  the actors current respective ages are 36 &amp; 29 and the year Happy Accidents was released Vincent D'Onofrio and Marissa Tomei's ages were 41 &amp; 36. So the age difference isn't too dissimilar although Mark Duplass looks older than he really is and Aubrey Plaza looks younger than she is. 

I suppose I'm just trying to understand where the difference lies in these films and why I would enjoy one and not the other. Perhaps people who have seen these films can relay what it was about **Safety Not Guaranteed** they liked.

On the other spectrum we have **K-Pax** and **Sound Of My Voice**. I enjoyed **Sound of My Voice** thoroughly. It is, low-budget sci-fi. I enjoyed the open ending where you, along with the protagonist, question whether or not Maggie was telling the truth. I haven't seen **K-Pax** since it first came out, but from what I do recall, it also had an open ending, whether the shell of the man who claimed to be from a different planet was telling the truth all along or he was just some crazy person. This film also resorts to many cheesy scenes in which Kevin Spacey's character changes the lives of those around him. I found the film boring and the ending just left me rolling my eyes. Again two different endings, so I am hoping for some insight from people who are more knowledgeable in film to provide some insight.

A surprising genre movie with real depth, the film is still firmly centred around misfits, dependency and love. It is made genuinely moving by two unusual lost souls who are neither good nor bad – each one continually exploits the other so we’re not sure who deserves our pity, but as social outcasts they both retain our sympathies throughout. This creates an interesting dynamic that makes their relationship utterly compelling, posing constant uncertainties about their motivations and designs on each other. Emmanuelle Devos’s performance is exceptional as the awkward Carla who discovers confidence and her sexuality under these abnormal circumstances. From vastly different worlds, the strange chemistry the pair develop is at the heart of the picture. Beautifully shot in a style verging on voyeurism, the camera is allowed to linger on the small mannerisms or personal moments of reflection that truly create rounded character and silently progress the story – Carla looking at herself in the mirror, embracing its characters as well as its plot.

Subverting the thriller genre and remaining unpredictable for long periods, the film's audacity and subversion of the genre clearly set it apart from its peers. A character driven thriller tinged with melodrama, capable of poignancy and tense exhilaration.

Storaro's colors are incredibly vibrant, so it's probably no accident that the reddest scene in the movie is when the proletariat first fight back. If anybody has seen Visions of Light, Storaro talks about his use of color from The Last Emperor (also made with Bertolucci): he would often isolate a single color to dominate a certain shot, depending on its symbolic importance.

The use of the seasons is also great. Summer is a perfect setting for the earlier childhood scenes, he is not the magnificent Prince from The Leopard; he was become a withered old man, senile from the beginning of the movie. Some have even gone so far as to say that Novecento is the follow-up to The Leopard; some of the connections made are certainly no accident. Winter is an appropriate backdrop to the rule of Fascism: many of the scenes shot under the Fascists are nearly monochromatic. It's like an old triptych, where the grisaille exterior opens to the saturated colors inside; for Novecento, it is the Spring and the fall of Fascism, something that appeared in many of Bertolucci's early movies.

Morricone's score is one of his best. It is certainly among his most diverse; it plays like a modern opera. The opening theme could be a national anthem. I especially like the music that accompanies the young Olmo and Alfredo - it is reminiscent of his music for Days of Heaven.

Lars von Trier seems so fancy himself as this generation's Andrei Tarkovsky or Ingmar Bergman. His films are weighty and philosophical and have a dream like presence

The Sacrifice is about a group of people in a house in a remote area dealing with the possibility of WWIII and complete nuclear fallout. The sense of impending doom is heightened by the fact that there is a young child with them who would suffer the same fate. As a tribute to Ingmar Bergman

Melancholia is a films about a family in a beautiful mansion in the days leading up to a collision between earth and another planet. They too have a young child with them to amplify the tragedy. It is also about depression and what it's like to go through your own wedding while suffering from severe depression.

The Characters in either film deal with their emotions in the same way each film maker would. In The Sacrifice

I happen to love Lars von Trier's work with Dogville and Breaking the waves being my favorites followed by Melancholia and Antichrist. Do you think future generations will appreciate his films as much as we appreciate Tarkovsky and Bergman? I think his last two films are evidence that he wants to go in that direction and be their spiritual successor. Melancholia and Antichrist are meditations on human grief and suffering but are also very spiritual and conscious of an almost sentient environment much like Stalker(1977) and sport stunning cinematography. The only major variance is that von Trier uses CGI and heavy distortion on his [surreal scenes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kP-vuOy8cU) whereas Bergman and Tarkovsky rarely used special effects. Do agree or do you consider it a dishonor to lump him with such masters? Are there other directors who make spiritual and enigmatic films like those of Tarkovsky or Bergman?

The number one thing- the photography. This is a beautiful film. I want to watch it again several more times immediately so I can judge if I'm being hyperbolic in my judgement that this is one of the best-shot films ever. There is something purely cinematic in the expressionist set design, and even less showy scenes are perfectly shot, in a way that grabs and directs your attention to the technique. 

Even mundane edits have something to them, but I just saw it and am excited even though I don't know the film enough to understand these things fully.

Also good- The excisions made were the right ones, it also loses the hard-to-follow and uninteresting Fortinbras subplot, much of the less successful comedy and gives a sense of focus. Let's be real, nobody's missing Rosencrantz and Guildenstern that much

The less good: The film is dated by the heavy influence of early 20th century Freudian psychology which is often distracting and embarrassingly heavy handed. That's not to say I don't think it's an interesting and valid reading worth exploring

The other issue's the acting. I came in expecting pre-method, almost mechanical, he neither imbues emotion or reads the poetry of the lines well. I'm exaggerating, perhaps, but his performance just isn't that good, even compared to his contemporaries. He's unmemorable; he feels at the mercy of the films visuals.

Cinematography: The way a film looks is always, and a major part of that is in what way the look of the film contributes to the story of the movie. Manhattan's is quite unique in this regard, because the message that the cinematography conveys seems to be opposite to the message that the film conveys. In the movie, the city of New York is a black and white wonderland, and whether you are getting off the highway coming back into the city, sitting by the bridge at the wee hours of the morning, or walking through a dreamy moon-surface part of the Rose center which must have been taken away before I ever went there, all the characters are total self-absorbed assholes. I think that Woody's way of conveying that this film is not a criticism of new york, in real life, where according to the visuals

Characters: Now I will addressing each specific character and the journeys that they take throughout the film in ""Story"" but for now I am only addressing the way woody is portraying the people of NY, even if, with the exception of Tracy and maybe Emily, you find out they kind of suck as people within minutes of meeting them. The fact that they all have likable traits is important though. It show that Woody wasn't making a movie about a bunch of terrible individuals, but that he was making a film about a bunch of good-hearted and intentioned, yet flawed people, with a level of personality that only someone who was a part of that community could probably understand. Once again, but labor of love. It takes a high level of understanding and involvement with this type of personality to make such a poignant movie about them

Story: In Manhattan, he is immature. This is characterized by both the decisions he makes, (IE: dating mary and quitting his job because it's unfulfilling), the way he talks to people (he is pretty much incapable of having a real adult conversation with anyone without cracking a bunch of silly jokes so often it becomes difficult to distinguish when he's joking and when he is serious.), and the way his life is contrasted by Tracy's. This last point is the most important, as I think that almost the entire point of having him date such a young woman was simply to showcase how immature he was: in almost every situation, she proves to be the more mature one of the group, she takes the breakup far better than Mary did, and identifying what was wrong with the way she left him, where he has not fully matured

I had several problems with the film that I'd love to open to discussion:

First, it is again obvious this is true. I obviously can't go through every plot point, but throughout the film very little caught me off guard. All of the supposedly ""surprising"" moments were moments that would actually be shocking if they happened in real life, but of course in the world of fiction the surprising thing happens more often than not, so you have to work a little harder to catch your audience off guard.

Second, well, every high school based TV show/movie ever made, and it wasn't even done particularly well. Another is the two dimensional, stereotypical portrayal of the idyllic small town. Another is the son shooting Foggarty (Something else that annoyed me is that the film never revisits this scene as far as I could tell, which seems odd considering how important it was.) Another is the classic fight-transitions-into-emotional-sex scene. I could go on...but I won't.

Prometheus was a beautiful looking and ambitious film

For starters, being vague allows each of us to have a different and unique experience like looking at a painting of abstract art. BAH regardless, creators of artistic material should aim to reach for something more than meh which this film was. I hate him.

If you ignore the flimsy characters, like tree of life it seemed like it was trying to encompass everything, yet wound up as a compilation of confusing rough cuts. It also has the plot of alien VS predator which is a film that I pretend doesn't exist most of the time. Uninspired, misdirected or confused by the writers. So many moments of excitement though. HR Giger art coming to life was cool. New monsters were cool even though they seem to have done it just because it was expected. Also the message of ""everything is alien and we have to get as far away from it because it will KILL YOU ALL"" was so clumsily narrated. 

The beginning/middle and end was horrible sludge. The squid baby was painful (in many ways) to watch and could have been one of those scenes which people talk about forever but the punchline fell flat. Why didn't anybody notice her injuries nor the squid baby in the next room? What happened to the people in the hazmat suits from the previous scene? Blown up?, he didn't expect the squid baby) but that's just stupid.

1376400318.0,1k9y6w,Weerasethakul and Lynch: Binaries of the Bizarre,oddmanout192,27,1,5,"Just as an ominous giant appears to Dale Cooper in his weakest moment in David Lynch’s classic television series Twin Peaks, Weerasethakul seems to see light. Not to say that Lynch does not have any harbingers of light in his films
	
Why are these two cinemas of the bizarre so fundamentally different? A large factor must be a difference of culture in their lives. Lynch developed his art in the seedy underbelly of 1970s Philadelphia, where the darkness of America could have influenced him, but his Thai roots seemed to be too strong for penetration. While he does address certain Westernized aspects of his own culture, such as the tackiness of Boonmee’s funeral, the film remains meditatively Thai in nature. Lynch’s films remain meditatively American in nature, but not the smiling American Dream kind of America, instead the “dream of dark and troubling things” that plagues us all. Lynch explores darkness and corruption of men
	
Lynch’s America is one of crime, he creates hopeful protagonists who are striving for a chance to succeed in the cutthroat world, but ultimately they succumb to the pressures around them and allow darkness to envelope them. Even films with seemingly happy endings maintain an aura of darkness, such as in Blue Velvet. While Jeffrey Beaumont may have helped end the crime spree of Frank Booth, he sacrificed his innocence in the process. Having flirted with death and succumbed to the allures of intense lust, Beaumont is left a grizzled man where the curious boy from the beginning of the film once stood. So, even as he stands in the kitchen with his girlfriend watching a robin perch on the windowsill as if nothing has ever been wrong in the world
	
This is the sort of darkness that Lynch toys with in his films. It is unforgiving and unrelenting. It ruins the hearts of human beings, and sometimes even the absurd, into something truly terrifying to the point where he makes us wonder whether torture can be art. While he uses many of the same techniques as Weerasethakul, his work is built on different, American foundations that do not lend themselves to hope. He challenges us to face the darkness hidden in the hearts of men and come out on the other side.
	
What lays on this other side? Perhaps it is Weerasethakul and his own brand of the bizarre. Where Lynch explores the darkness of America, on a human level, the escape from Lynch’s darkness. It is a reflection on things that have passed in order to move towards the light and escape the burdens of the material world. Uncle Boonmee recalling his past lives is, on a societal level, Thailand reflecting on its past states of existence, in order to reconcile them with its current state of existence.
	
Uncle Boonmee is dying and he wants to be reincarnated into something better or at least something equally good, in an unrelenting fashion, until one or the other recedes. Uncle Boonmee forces the darkness to recede. 	The arrival of Boonmee’s dead wife and transformed son is not merely a meeting for sentimental purposes, but a meeting of reconciliation. Boonmee gets a chance to say all the things that he should have said to his wife while she was alive. He gets a chance to speak to his disappeared son one final time. In these chances, there are more reflections on darkness. Boonmee had a part in the fate of his family and must tackle those issues. If Boonmee had been a better father, his son would not have felt the need to disappear into the jungle in order to become a Monkey Ghost. In these moments, Boonmee’s past lives are his family’s lives and their reflections. They are not meant as strictly Boonmee’s, the darkness will recede and Boonmee makes it one step closer to light.
	
Uncle Boonmee’s light is death. All he hopes for is a peaceful death and a satisfactory reincarnation. As Weerasethakul takes us through the mystical, he is taking us through Boonmee’s confrontational journey. Having returned to his original birthplace, Boonmee lays down to die. Throughout the film, he confronted different elements of darkness: his family, his violent past, his allegorical past (which may have been a literal past life), and the possibilities of his future. In Boonmee’s mind, both hopefully and peacefully
	
Boonmee’s death is juxtaposed to a Lynchian death, the two filmmakers’ work creates a bottleneck of the bizarre, which visually manifests itself as a bowtie. In the beginning of a David Lynch film, the darkness exists, but there are many courses of action that the characters can take (the wide, left end of the bowtie). As the film goes on, options decrease, as options have run out, we have reached the other side along with him
	
Lynch’s work seems to hold no hope for the state of America, one dominated by mythological religious practices. Boonmee reflects on his murder of communists in a war, revealing political issues that rise to the surface of his life, which most likely remain prevalent in most Thais’ minds. Political reflections remain vague, but they are certainly present. Perhaps the vignette of the militants’ relationship with the Monkey Ghost is another form of allegory for Thai politics. Boonmee’s reversion to a secluded life of agriculture perhaps suggests a reversion within the Thai societal landscape. If we are to look past individualistic interpretations of the film, some leaps must be made in order to reconcile the allegorical nature of the film with the real life politics of Thailand.
	
The ending of the film, not even noticing their body doubles, which stand not five feet from where they are watching. This sequence makes viewers acutely aware of the fact that they are glued just as intently as the family is. We must be looking at screens all of the time. The pure, natural world has been replaced with a virtual, digital world. The status quo of civilization has changed.
	
If we are looking at Lynch and Weerasethakul as a kind of yin and yang, in fact, complement each other. The success of these kinds of cinema proves that film is still alive and well as a medium, and perhaps reaching a new golden age. When pertinent binaries and comparisons can be drawn between two filmmakers that are seemingly worlds away, such as what has been done here, we can be confident that film has succeeded. It has become a global art with a universal language that we can all understand, and it has accomplished the task of turning the human condition into an art form.
	
'The most beautiful thing here is that, post-Structuralist paradigm, these interpretations are merely interpretations. The art is so raw that emotions billow forth from the most unusual places, rendering the playing field so that my interpretation can be emotionally different from the next person’s interpretation. In this, I am confident that both Weerasethakul and Lynch would be extremely satisfied. They did not set out to create something concrete or definable. They set out to create a brand new kind of cinema, one that is based around feeling and not thinking, sensing and not understanding. It's about believing.

I first saw this movie years ago and loved it without knowing why. In discussion with my girlfriend

First I want to touch on the cinematography. Newton Sigel is a TV DP that has in the last ten years moved into film. Most notably he shot Drive for Refn. Anyway, feel and visual reference point. For example, the scenes in Helsinki and East Berlin are in stark contrast to his appearances in the TV world as a producer and later host. This dichotomy of visual elements enforces the divide chuck feels in his life. 

The second visual aspect that really added to the story is centered around what's on the screen and how it is shown. The first notion of interest is when Chuck is taking a tour of CBS studios and asks for an application. As the shot continues on the tour, theoretically several months later, as he overhears what he needs to do to get laid, and applies for management. The movement and theatrical devices used in this shot are similar to techniques used in live theatre and TV. The shot itself feels like a choreographed dance from a broadway show, but instead of singing the story we glide through events seamlessly in one fluid motion.
The next time this happens

The film uses several key moments like this to instill a sense of what Chuck is going through. This is important because he is by all accounts not a very likable character. He's an asshole to his friends and coworkers and his game shows are about ridicule and embarrassment of individuals based on core emotions like love and acceptance. Despite these truths though

The last of these visual elements that help to instill the story's deeper ideas is toward the end of the film. As he begins to deteriorate under the criticism and eventual failure of his shows, where he shot his second kill. As his world is falling apart around him, so is the word of the film that we trusted. We take the film for fact all be it possibly stretched fact, until he himself starts to question his sanity. Than we begin to loose faith in the truth of the narrative. Just like he does in his own life.

This is where Clooney has masterfully connected the brilliant Kaufman script to a compelling screen version. The film itself twists and turns through the world of Chuck Barris. We are told the story through his eyes, though we've seen it before in the film. Example; There is a brief glimpse of him in a hotel room being sung happy birthday to by a prostitute. We see this and than cut away. No explanation no relevance, it's just something he did. Than later we see that he was abused by his mother, and the image of the prostitute comes back, with his mother in her place. We now know this image, but not in this context.

1373632736.0,1i5dzt,"""Timecrimes"" by Vigalondo",Lazar_Taxon,31,6,6,"I seem to be among a minority who don’t like this film. I wanted very much to like it - it was well shot (especially given its small budget), I felt as though I had just seen a sequence of arbitrary things that had no reason to be put to film. All the events were dictated by the logic of “it happened because it happened” - looking at the movie as a whole, but I don’t think this made for good storytelling. By the time the third act rolled around

I would contrast this movie with two others that deal with causal loops more successfully: *Twelve Monkeys* and *Primer*. *Twelve Monkeys* provides the viewer with engaging elements of mystery as the story unfolds, which has no time travel at all. *Rubber* opens with an ode to “no reason”, explicitly informing the viewer of the arbitrary nature of what they’re about to see - *Timecrimes* adheres to this credo too, constructing its plot from arbitrary, atemporal propositions as I mentioned above. And *Rubber* commits to its concept - it definitely does depict a sentient, psychokinetic tire which kills people. But it’s also got a metastory about the “directors” of its surface story, who kill their audience by feeding them a poison turkey. Their leader, starts out in control of things but is eventually killed by the monster that he’s unleashed. He’s reminiscent of *Timecrimes’* time machine controller - played by Vigalondo himself - who seems to know what he’s doing at the start of the film

Putting this in context of other movies about India made for Western consumption that I have seen

I compare this to movies about Africa. I cannot think of a mainstream Western movie set in Africa that does not acknowledge at least briefly the suffering and poverty in that continent.

I want to specifically talk about the composition and long takes.

   We see a very different approach here than we do in traditional film. But I think it fits the film very well. He manages to encompass and properly address multiple hot button issues in todays society without ever feeling preachy or pushing opinions/solutions on the viewer. 
I think first and foremost does the camera work support the theme of authenticity. The long takes give the viewer the impression of being IN the scene. Most of the time camera movement is kept to a minimal to provide an **unbiased** view of the event. I find it very easy to place myself in the scenes and through that feel much more connected to what is happening. Haneke shows plain and blunt what is happening as not to influence any opinion the viewer might be forming. Traditional film is much more obvious in the regard that it tells you what to think most of the time.

   Another thing I want to talk about are the cuts. Often in the middle of a conversation or action we just cut to black. It's almost like we're sitting in front of a TV switching the channel but Haneke has the control. This is where much more of his intentions shine through. We see exactly what he want us to see. Most of the time uncomfortable scenes that makes us want to look away. But he makes us watch and therefor think about how we would act in such situations. The cuts show how unconnected everything is in the end. The first time I watched this film like you would any other from beginning to end. Then when I got more interested I started watching single scenes over and over again. I really think this movie is designed to be watched multiple times. The loosely connected plot almost invites it. We never see the whole picture though. Just bits and pieces... As promised in the title ""Incomplete Tales of Several Journeys"".

I could go off on several scenes and go into detail but I don't want to turn this into an essay :)

The Toy Story trilogy on the surface is about toys that come to life

Finding Nemo is about overcoming forces that you would normally never in your life attempt to tackle if it weren't for trying to save your lost son.

The Incredibles looks at xenophobia

Wall-E is the story of coming to terms with feelings of abandonment, and then overcoming those obstacles. (Along with another huge side-message about humanity fucking ourselves up through over-consumer tendencies)

Up is the story of almost giving up on your hopes and dreams and then finding new life in a new adventure

Etc.

Brave dealt with a ""going your own way"" type of message, it was all pretty much on the surface.

My reasons for finding the film bad:

1) The direction was bad.

- Most clichéd shots ever used very often (like the final couple smiling at the camera and the subsequent walk into/from the camera).

- Poor storytelling (character motivation pulled out of the ass

- Many unrelated WTF scenes (basketball, try as I might.

2) The acting was bad.

- Actors dying in the most theatrical way (pronouncing their last word

- Some actors acting as if they'd been literally retarded (Shuya's best friend waving like Rain Man at the WTF reversed basket ball scene).

3) The screenplay was bad.

- Don't tell me how great BR was at showing the demise of system and humanity

- Plot devices all over the film

- Plot holes (no one fighting a whole one night; none of the parents caring about their kids being killed off by one another; none of the army personnel doubting Kitano's ""it's over"" decision

- Characters behaving like total fucking idiots (Oh no, then free the guy I hated and wanted to kill in the first place and commit suicide! Hey, my classmates want to kill me, I'd better go for a run; fortunately I brought my tracksuit and running shoes to this field trip!)

4) The music was poor.

- Generally it sounded like an 80's ""B"" action movie's soundtrack.

- It didn't fit the atmosphere of many scenes at all.

5) The WTF moments

- Some characters dying after a single shot

- The WTF scenes already described above.

- The WTF painting at the end. Was that supposed to be drawn by some child?

- The kid eating a handful of confetti at the basketball scene.

- That good guy that had survived the game once already dying at the end

- Kitano resurrected for one more call and one more cookie and then dying more theatrically than all the others have managed so far.

- And many others in this category…

I suspect this has something to do with Hollywood's uneasy place on the intersection between art and commerce.  One can view a film as art that achieves something between the sublime and the ridiculous, but he [did](http://arthistory.about.com/od/from_exhibitions/ig/dali_painting_and_film/dali_moma_0708_20.htm).  No matter.

Anyway, but I will try to consider only the most pressing of them here.

Firstly, and I don't think that's a necessarily easy case to make.   Are the works of Robert Ludlum really more sophisticated than those of Ernest Hemingway?  Are the songs of John Mayer more intricate and relevant than those of Bob Dylan?  Television viewers of the 1950's might not have had shows of the depth and complexity of a *Justified* or *Game of Thrones*, but neither did they fritter away their time on the abject banalities of *Here Comes Honey Boo Boo* or *16 and Pregnant*.   I say this not to deny that people in the past also wasted time, but to suggest that the shift in the rube-to-sophisticate ratio might not be as one directional as some of us would like to think.

After all, and only arrogance would lead us to believe that we appreciate them more now than did his contemporaries (or our many generations of ancestors).  Indeed, what would we think of he opinion of a high schooler who proclaimed that *Macbeth* ""doesn't hold up""?  If his point were that the language and virtue of Shakespeare isn't immediately accessible to the uninitiated modern audience, it would be unassailable - but that isn't what this particular condemnation means.  It is true that popular social tastes and grammars change, but expressive art is so intensely personal in both creation and appreciation that it would seem impossible for social trends to render a once-great artwork universally unenjoyable.  One might need to familiarize himself with the language of Shakespeare for the beauties of *Macbeth* to be revealed, but that doesn't mean that they no longer exist.  The wisdoms, the insight, waiting to be experienced by future generations willing to engage with it.  Similarly

Products can become redundant with the passage of time

This brings me to my next (and more mercifully brief) point about the dismissal of ""doesn't hold up"" - it's not only a flattery of  the sophistication of the modern critic, content to believe that he's missed nothing.  That's neither a serious nor responsible approach to film criticism, and it's one that grossly inhibits development as an intelligent, well-rounded human being.

No one has to like any given film, rather than an acceptance of it.

1371518633.0,1gk1ag,Still Waiting For Superman [MoS Review] (X-Post from r/movies),Shadow16nh,46,21,32,"I was not expecting Man of Steel to fit entirely within the bounds of my own nostalgic conception of Superman; I was actually hoping its filmmakers would go in some uncharted directions

I should get the few things I did appreciate out of the way: the Kryptonian art direction, but I’ll return to that later.

The main selling point of this film was that the makers of The Dark Knight trilogy were bringing their somber, whether or not that could have been a good fit for Superman is still unknown, because Zack Snyder and company only half-heartedly committed themselves to it, and only in the most superficial ways.

When I read the reviews complaining that the highbrow sci-fi approach the movie was sold as to the public was misleading, Snyder's usual colorful flair and confident direction were completely absent. I would never have been able to tell Man of Steel was directed by him from just looking at it. They asked him to emulate the visual style of The Dark Knight trilogy, and the end product was a second-rate, strangely confused mix of restrained and epileptic camerawork. I do think that had Snyder been allowed to handle things with his trademark style it could have been at the very least, a visually fascinating film. People like to deride slo-mo as a cheap commercial Hollywood trend, but the content and framing of the way he put images together in 300, Watchmen and especially Legend Of The Guardians was highly artistic

In Man Of Steel, which I thought contained the bulk of the film's creativity). When I got out of it, I was stunned to realize that strictly with regard to action, the Transformers franchise (which I’ve thought to be the embodiment of everything that’s wrong with Hollywood) were probably more entertaining watches, because the CGI and the physics they operate on seemed more consistently realistic, and the colors were vibrant. Man Of Steel isn't quite as frenetically disorienting as the universally-derided Revenge of The Fallen (the one glaring exception to my aforementioned comparison), but for a movie that was clearly going for a more realistic aesthetic

But as is usually the case with almost any film I’ve not enjoyed, only to fill each component scene with generic, sometimes awkward dialogue that the intelligently cast, fine actors make every effort to sell with little help from some amateurish framing and sluggish editing. The script in Man of Steel is far less cynically shallow than in something like a Transformers film, but it’s also painfully mediocre and clunky; other than Superman's two father figures, nobody is given much to say. I left Man Of Steel with a new appreciation for the Marvel Studios film universe. Plotting aside, the script in the worst Avengers film, was cleverer and the actual quality of the filmmaking on display was more consistent with itself than that of Man Of Steel. Now that I think about it

Fan complaints about Superman Returns (2006) being pretty much devoid of any superhuman physical brawling were responded to with an almost laughable overcompensation: Superman gets to show off his powers by combating more than one physical equal, cars, planes being routinely tossed into populated areas – all without Superman making any kind of an effort to steer the fights elsewhere or even seeming to notice what was happening to the tens of thousands of innocent bystanders; he's just fighting to prevail over the bad guy. That's something which runs directly counter to the character's traditional depiction but also counter to any character that purports to value human life enough to make it their life’s mission to protect. Superman saves humanity in a broader sense during a key part of the film’s finale, but during most of the brawls he shows little empathy for the individual mortals who are dying horribly right before his eyes, save a few key characters that are essential to the plot. Turning Metropolis into a video game environment and conveying barely any emotional regard for the consequences of all that death and destruction is what caused me to start hating the film. That’s just not the Superman I know. Superman’s real weakness isn't Kryptonite (thankfully absent from this film); it’s his love for all mankind, and this isn't something that’s effectively exploited until the very final fight between he and Zod, which I must admit to appreciating

[MINOR SPOILERS]

There were a number of other smaller annoyances that helped to drag the experience down even further: the utterly silly way that Pa Kent is dispatched, having no previously-established relationship to his new employers, no apparent background in journalism, and just as handsome and put-together as ever. Then he puts on his glasses, in full view of everyone, and exchanges a knowing look with Lois, as though the entire world and more specifically, that was the most egregious insult to the audience’s intelligence.

It's not as though the filmmakers didn't have basically good intentions, or Ghost Rider or Fantastic Four or X-Men Origins: Wolverine; but it is painfully mediocre, and it could and should have actually been so much better.

The way the movie doesn't seem to follow any rules irritates me. When the main character tries to ""rescue"" the short-haired girl and they go driving, then laughing and sympathizing with him, then instantly back to being pissed at him.

1375335725.0,1jh681,My interpretation of the ending of Magnolia and why I find it cruel and saddening,sudevsen,29,5,9,"I watched Magnolia yesterday as part of a PTA marathon (one movie per week) and its my favourite PTA movie so far though I haven’t seen PDL and H8 yet.

Reading many of the discussion posts of the movie here and around the internet I was surprised that people find the end to be about redemption and that by the end things are better for most characters.I couldn’t agree less to this.I saw the ending as cruel and discomforting seeing how the rest of the movie plays out.The message that seems to come out from  the movie is that “random things happen and it did happen” but I feel a deeper message is

In the beginning we are shown characters who are lonely-Donnie,Claudia,Jim,Phil(maybe) and to some extent Earl who is more regretful than lonely.At the end some  of these characters find that someone in their life or the redemption they seek and that makes it a ‘happy’ ending.However except from Claudia and Jim most other characters don’t end up better off than they actually are.Infact some of them are worse for it.

The entire movie shows how TJ’s poor relationship with his father has deeply affected him.It’s sad that even though by the end he has had some reconciliation with Earl

But what about Donnie himself?By the end nothing has changed for him.He is lonely

Now let’s talk about the big redemption that happens in the movie that we all remember-TJ and Earl.However its not even clear whether Earl has even realised that TJ was there.It was stated that after  taking  liquid morphine one practically ‘dies’ and since TJ meets Earl after Phil has given him the morphine its possible that Earl is already ‘dead’ and he has died without meeting his son for the last time and with all his regrets and sorrows.There is no redemption whatsoever for him.TJ might be even worse off.For a man struggling with loss and loneliness all his life he is shown the briefest hints of family happiness before it is snatched away.This along with the expose that he is lying about his past may badly affect the only thing htat he has got going for him-his S&amp;D work.In his case it’s a case of loved and lost being crueller than never loving.

The worst creatures however are Linda and Jimmy Gator.In the beginning Jimmy has everything-a wife’s love

Speaking of suicide the other character who has it bad by the end is Linda who also attempts suicide.She is now in the same position as Earl-having to spend the rest of her life with nothing but regrets.I am not sure which is worse-Linda having to live a lonely life or Jimmy having to die a lonely death?

The only people who get their happy ending is Claudia and Jim which is perhaps why their scene is the movie’s last scene as if to give the effect of “alls weel that ends well” which can cover up the fact that everyone else is worse off.What hurts the most is that for a movie which shows people having a sad and regretful life it also ends with people having sad and regretful lives.

This is what I think.Maybe I am wrong but given that this movie can be interpreted in so many ways I believe the ending can be seen from many perspectives

Had Jarmusch played up the ""intertwined stories"" aspect of the film, or an Elvis song they heard simultaneously](/spoiler), I think I would have enjoyed the film more, but that's just a matter of personal preference I guess.

1369709752.0,1f6ddb,On Wilder's Ace in the Hole (1951),elephantsinthealps,29,5,2,"So, uploaded by paramount.

*Ace in the Hole* does not discover or unearth a hidden tension, did little to change the Jeffersonian ideals of the agrarian utopia that had become fixed in the American collective consciousness as an element of their self-perception, that’s to say, despite the increasingly industrialized economy of the US still perceived itself, the citizenry, as mostly made up of farmers, tradespeople and merchants. The extending cultural reach of the urban was still to be regarded at best with suspicion and at worst with hostility. What it provides is not discovery but rather examination and commentary.

The demographic aspect is perhaps the most important to consider when analyzing Ace in the Hole’s socio-cultural commentaryand in turn there are three major aspects when considering the demographic shifts and divides that were becoming apparent during this period: first, second, urban populations had reached their apex at the time in 1950 (for example, New York’s population reached an all-time high in 1950, which would not be surpassed until the 70s, and which would not stabilize at a higher number until the 21st century), and third, which had only been part of the US for about a century

Kirk Douglas introduces himself, but Charles Tatum From New York. This modifier forms as much as part of his identity as his job, that is to say, the way he thinks of himself necessarily incorporates his urbanity^1. An identity he constructs not on geography but rather on negation, in the way he insists on his urbanity he’s mostly asserting himself as not from “the country” rather than from any particular city^2. This sets him up as an agent of the city forcing itself upon “the country” by emphasizing the disconnect between himself and the space he finds himself.

Kirk Douglas looks at the embroidered maxim of “Tell The Truth” and quips, it sets up the frame for the central event in the narrative where the maxim is twisted around and pulled from its moral foundation until the final act where in an excessively ironic turn, Douglas’ effort to embrace its original meaning is met with deaf ears, scorn or derision by the members of The City.

Our first taste of Tatum’s twisting of the maxim comes during the scene immediately following, which becomes a recurring theme of the movie. What he is doing is ensnaring the paper’s owner by telling him flat out that he is a liar^3, which is true, but in the nonchalant confession there is an implicit element of submission and a hint of reformation wrapped in the veil of aloof pragmatism, but the truth is that Tatum wants to appear as if he is at the end of his rope and thus as having no bargaining power but his disarming honesty, whether he really is or not is merely incidental. In reality, he is using the truth as a weapon, a maneuver worthy of Iago, as in Tatum’s business pitch that convinces Lorraine to not leave Leo.

Midway through Tatum meets and makes a deal with the sheriff to have Leo’s rescue delayed to have the story, once corruption is ignited it cannot be extinguished^4. The scene is a remarkably accurate depiction of the birth of petty corruption, in that it often stems from a public servant with low wages which causes him to hold little loyalty for his employer (i.e: the public) at the symbolic level and a relatively big incentive to disregard “the spirit” of the job. It’s important to point out that even if Tatum is the catalyst for it, the corruption was itself already there, incubating as it were, since you can’t corrupt the honest, or so the the film goes.

The film also raises a potential answer for the question of why ruthlessness is so pervasive in the “lot of hardboiled eggs”^5, the very same cause for the amorality is also presented as its own cure: is it not also the bond of the members between the band of brothers that becomes the redeeming entity for Tatum? The movie makes a case for a humanity that is flawed but not inherently evil^6. Tatum himself, like Iago before him^7, isn’t evil in vacuo, he’s working from the principle of revenge to the industry that scorned his talent for what he considers irrelevant or petty reasons.

Stepping back then, the movie shies away from saying exactly what it is that urban life does in order to achieve or perhaps intensify the post-war alienation of the veteran population, perhaps deliberately.

Both reviews from my Letterboxd account

**The Mirror**

Tarkovsky amazed me again with a film that deviates from his already solid and legendary film-making style.

This films is far more surreal at times than some of his other films and strongly reminded me of some of Imgar Bergman's films at times. Though some may find the structure polarizing, and their son, often time having the one actress portray both his ex-wife and mother.

The symbolism in the films is sublime and evokes some of Tarkovsky's strongest imagery ever. The characters in this films also feel stronger than his other films

**Ivan's Childhood**

HOLY SHIT GUYS!

That has been my reaction to almost every Tarkovsky film I've seen so far but his work always manages to surprise me. This film especially astounded me to see how much of a master he had become so early in his career. I try to bring into words my feelings on this film and all that comes to mind is the word perfection. All I can say is that Andrei Tarkovsky's first film (in my humble and greatly biased opinion) surpasses masters of cinema such as Kubrick and Wells in the prime of their careers(I know).

First off I'd like to say that if anyone is looking for a good starting point to delve into Tarkovsky's filmography

The acting in this film is fantastic

Now this movie is just really eerie. There are many many interpretations on what it all means too. Or not even what it ""means"" but what is really going on. Either it could be really a guy either lying about a meeting he had with a woman yet trying to put his advances on her anyway (or not lying and upset she doesn't remember their meeting last year), which would make sense because towards the end some pretty intense scenes comes up. I guess on my first viewing I attributed it to just a woman who is afraid and reluctant to go with this man because she still loves her husband. Then there is the scene where something violent happens which I wont spoil here and the male protagonist says ""I need you alive!"". It can be confusing, which is why I need to rewatch it and analyze it more.

1364917618.0,1bir4q,Film Discussion: Picnic At Hanging Rock,shifty1032231,27,5,4,"Peter Weir's film and basically one of the most famous from Australia is very comparable to Antioni's L'Avventura. Set during the early 1900s four girls disappear from their college trip to the Hanging Rock for a picnic. They are not able to be found. Like L'Avventura the film is not about finding the lost girls. 

I found it interesting that the main character is the girl left behind. Basically she is more of the outcast because she can't afford to be there and is more punished. The rest of the girls are bland. The only other remotely interesting one is the girl who is fearful as a band of them search the Hanging Rock. 

The Hanging Rock is his mysterious place where weird things happen. The smitten Michael's experience of trying to find the girls reveals that to me the Hanging Rock is someways Supernatural. He basically becomes inept and collapses. Same with the recovered girl.

To me this is a device for the start of another plot just like in L'Avventiura. The plot of the two lovers searching for the girl in L'Avventura leads to jealously and grim human nature. This is played out in the college where the outcast is fighting against the administration. This later leads to the end which I will not spoil.

To me this is a very good film that has great cinematography showing the Hanging Rock in this glowing sunlight basking in the area. I read that the DP put a wedding dress veil over the lenses to give it that look. The film shows many natural scenes invoking how nature conquers over those trying to settle this land (Remember

1363880276.0,1aqj6t,Film Discussion: The Last of the Mohicans (1992) (spoilers),Othy,32,10,7,"I watched this movie about a week ago and have very mixed feelings on it leaning more toward a negative opinion. I am surprised by this because I had heard such great things about it. That's not to say it was bad or poorly made

Perhaps it is because I have read the book, felt like it was attempting to present a romanticized picture of the French and Indian War. That's not necessarily a bad thing for some people but it irks me. Romanticizing anything can leave me feeling like the movie (or documentary) is being emotionally manipulative. 

The movie did have a few elements of grittiness to it what with the scalpings and cutting out of a heart but they felt very out of place give the general ""air"" the movie. The feel of the movie didn't seem to match with the images presented in the book. The book felt very gritty and even cruel in some parts. There were a few select scenes from the book that I was hoping would make an appearance in the movie due to their moral ambiguity. Instead

Consider The Road (2009). It managed to omit some of the more brutal scenes of the book but kept enough of the moral quandary and atmospheric feel to be considered a good adaptation of the book.

Now lets say the work exists on its own. I'll forget about the book for a moment.

The second sister, maybe. Then, when Uncas dies, I feel bad because I know that Chingachgook loved his kid, but I don't feel bad because I don't know Uncas as a character. In addition, when Alice throws herself off the cliff, it also means little because she was barely developed as well. The only emotional attachment I have to these characters is through their relatives who have been developed (Alice's sister Cora and Uncas' father Chingachgook). I feel bad for Cora and Chingachgook

As for DDL's performance, then he did an admirable job of acting as someone who was raised by Native Americans. Other than that, I found nothing very noteworthy of his performance. 

All that said

I was downvoted in /r/movies for saying that I didn't care for the movie much and I'm wondering if I am alone on that opinion.

Genre films are a great interest of mine. It's always interesting to hear about the commercial interests which have often influenced a particular style of film. The studios will shamelessly chase a demographic--like Nikkatsu turning out action films during the 60s and later pink eiga during the 70s to capture the young male demo. Likewise, these production-houses certainly have no illusions about the quality of their movies: I once watched an interview with Jean-Claude Van Damme where he recounted that Menahem Golan had initially planned to shelve Bloodsport because he thought the movie was terrible, yet the movie became a surprise hit. It seems like these sorts of movies have become an investment vehicle of sorts in recent years; many B-movie studios will make flicks for less than $10 mil and use rental/home video/international sales to make quick cash.

In this text I will also use the words Imperialism and Capitalism interchangeably, because Imperialism, as Lenin put it, is “the highest stage of Capitalism”.


Kurtz himself appears perhaps as a satirical allegory for the perpetrator’s ideal outcome of modernity, they gather resources for him and carry out any work that needs doing – a clear representation of Dependency theory, or “the notion that resources flow from a ""periphery"" of poor and underdeveloped states [in this case, people] to a ""core"" of wealthy states [Kurtz]”1.


Kurtz represents an opposition to the tendency of anti-Imperialists to ‘romanticise tradition, in a pile on the ground. 


These subtleties leave me in comfortable disagreement with Frank P Tomasulo’s suggestion that Coppola ‘subordinated content to style’3 – Instead I feel that Coppola made content and style equal


Another example of how Kurtz is an allegory for Imperialism is the way that he has little philosophical problem in killing innocent people in attempts to gain order, because you’re still alive”.

Kurtz is also a character used often to highlight the hypocrisy of Capitalist society

The photojournalist’s character, it blindly supported the U.S.A’s actions, and the stories it reported were almost solely positive. This only goes to further highlight the importance of media opinion in ending the Vietnam War – it was after all, photographs, such as the nine-year-old girl burned by napalm, which helped change the American citizen’s opinion4. He is also used as a method of foreshadowing the events of the war: “This is the way the fucking world ends! Look at this fucking shit we're in, man! Not with a bang, I'm fucking splitting”



An interesting observation of the military perpetrators in ‘Apocalypse Now’ is the way members of different races and social classes respond to orders and the War/Imperialism on the whole. It is a known fact that a large number of the soldiers in the Vietnam War were from poor backgrounds, Clean being a good example - “Mr Clean was from some South Bronx shithole and the light and space of Vietnam really put the zap on his head” – black soldier’s death toll numbers were double those of white soldiers in the beginning of the war5 and Black rights campaigners were extremely vocal about it, important because it proves that Wars in foreign countries also spawn social dissent at home.


In my opinion, to distance himself from the mind-set of the likes of Kilgore. Kilgore is a fitting representation of the absurdities involved in the Vietnam War. Even in War morals exist, and as French philosopher Jacques Maritain wrote, “Moralists are unhappy people” – Kilgore is certainly not a moralist, he is a sociopath so unaffected by the death and suffering surrounding him that he is cheerful enough to regularly go surfing on the beaches of villages he helped to raze to the ground. 

 In the ‘Redux’ version of the film

The struggle the American characters in the film face when matched by the vast number of Vietcong is a testament to what can be done with enough dedication. It is clear that the Americans on the Imperialist venture heavily outgun the natives. That thanks to the soldiers’ self-doubt and chaotic organisation

Between his early horror classics of *Frankenstein* and *Bride of Frankenstein*, I was absolutely enthralled with this archaic piece of studio ""horror"", much more so than some of the other so called classics in this period of the genre. Because of the exceedingly short running time (70-odd minutes) there is very little room for hackneyed sub-plots or trite and instead the story is pulled down to it's bare bones and the themes of isolation, madness and the perils of messing with science are all explored neatly, if not entirely deeply. There is enough light, almost slapstick, comedy in there to keep the proceedings from getting too dark (Universal seem to have a habit of having at least one crazy old person in each of their films for some comic relief) but Whale really manages to heighten the scary aspects of the character/themes superbly, unsure of whether they are being watched

Are people on TrueFilm of the opinion that the Universal Horror films made during the blossoming years of cinema were there purely to scare/entertain or was there a more subversive message being put across in these films? Did *Dracula* go deeper than simply being a gothic tale of bloodlust? Or do films with titles like *Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman* indicate that these were nothing more than money making ventures?

What I haven't understood is the significance of the carnivorous island that Pi encounters on his journey. It's made clear at the end of the film that the Japanese insurance agents think it's highly unlikely that the island exists, is a symbol for something. What does it signify?

I think it might symbolize Pi's lack of faith. 

Pi's boat is caught in a storm and the scene ends with Pi screaming (at God?) ""I lost my family, it takes away at night.

Regardless of what criteria we differentiate a “Good” movie from a “Bad” movie; I don’t believe the main purpose of this subreddit is to inventory the “Good” movies out there for other’s consumption.  The best feature of this subreddit is the discussion involved in helping to define why a particular movie is artistic, then shouldn’t any film that warrants a **meaningful** conversation have a place here?

In as much as we can describe why we love a film

1.	*Is the basic premise itself a good story?*  There are many films out there that take adaptations of classic story-lines and motifs and completely bastardize it.  We can recognize the inspiration for the film, there are films that manage to create a relatively unique story-line, but have too many instances of immature toilet humor, superfluous explosions, or plot deviations that the original, interesting story is lost in the mix.  My favorite examples of this are the Saw movies and Final Destination.  The films deal with people fighting against an almost certain death in unique situations (which is an idea I find very interesting), but the details of the story focus more on the gore and fright factor of Rube-Goldberg style death trap.

2.	*Could the movie have been saved if roles had been changed?*  Unless we get an almost immediate remake (see: [The Incredible Hulk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incredible_Hulk_\(film\))), and my imagination is sometimes too poor to even consider it.  What would Will Smith have done if he had taken the role of Neo in The Matrix?  What does that possible change show us about the abilities of Keanu Reeves vs. Will Smith?  What about if Kubrick would have actually completed A.I. while he was alive?  How would the maniacal and depressing styles of Kubrick have contrasted with Spielberg’s more hopeful and linear storytelling?

3.	*Are the artistic and stylistic intents in the film working per the original intent?*  I usually try to watch and judge a film based solely on its own merits

I know that this subreddit enjoys sharing the beautiful movies that are out there with each other, can be a helpful tool in helping to define our personal tastes.

1318954950.0,lgetb,Are heroic narratives about labor critical of capitalism?,saintandre,23,1,8,"I read [this article](http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/the-work-ethic-of-breaking-bad-20110808) about Breaking Bad and its place among recent television series that appear to be about people trying to do their jobs well. The author proposes that shows like Mad Men and Friday Night Lights are about men struggling with two opposing forces: being good

Mad Men makes a lot of subtle and not-so-subtle references to Ayn Rand, the show constantly pulls down characters who attempt to take their destinies into their own hands. Draper's reward for starting his own company is anxiety, alcoholism, a ruined marriage, a miserable daughter, financial instability and loneliness. There are people who are successful based on nepotism and politics, but those people are just as likely to be good at their jobs as the hard-working poor people like Draper and Peggy Olson. If there is a message in the show, and [the Spectacle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Society_of_the_Spectacle) (as Draper understands it) is just a big version of the thing every person has to do just to get by. Is that a Nietzschean justification of shitty behavior

I thought it would be useful to compare these shows to the kind of films about labor that were produced by communist regimes in the 20th century: mid-century Chinese kitchen sink melodramas about women trying to balance work and family life, like their American counterparts in the films of Douglas Sirk and Michael Curtiz, struggle with *getting* what they want, but not with *knowing* what they want. Soviet dairy farmers aren't even afforded the heroic subject position for the most part, as these films employ the ""collective protagonist"" approach Eisenstein used in Potemkin. 

Tarkovsky's films, but none of his movies really deal with labor as such. Andrei Rublev could be said to be about a painter who struggles with the question of why he paints, but his struggle isn't with the art market or patronage. His battle is with the validity of achievement in the first place, and his relationship with God in a world full of suffering. As adventurous as Tarkovsky is, even his movies that appear to be about the absence of God (Stalker, The Sacrifice, possibly others) still come from the perspective of characters wrestling with their souls. 

A show like Friday Night Lights, and the church (and everything else) is in service to that. People care so much about doing a good job that football becomes a receptacle for the feelings of disappointment, helplessness and fear that comes with living in the middle of a literal and spiritual desert (Texas, America, the immanent universe, et al). Matt Saracen is much like Andrei Rublev; the world in which he lives is torn apart by violence and tragedy, and the only things that don't strike him as absurd are art...and football.

And love, Mad Men, the Wire and Deadwood have in common is that people love each other. These shows are bleak portrayals of the working week, but all of them offer love as a shelter from existential crisis. No one ever wonders whether they should love. They just do it, the way that cops in action movies don't question whether they're part of a destructive apparatus for keeping capitalism afloat. In fact, any criticism of capitalism present in these shows would probably be rooted in their presentation of a dialectic between jobs and love; that is, between duty to a position in society and duty to a position in a family. The social construction of these motivations is not questioned. Few would likely stomach these shows if they did criticize romantic love. Mad Men, still puts forth Draper's love for his daughter and his sham ex-wife as possibly redemptive. 

Is that attachment to the narrative of love the flaw in the critical potential for these series? Christian Marxism would say the opposite: loving people is why we're critical of capitalism in the first place. So then are these series just insufficiently inclusive of radical ideology? The Wire doesn't exclude much in terms of pessimistic attitudes toward systems of power. The police can't do their job, in that the criticism is de-fanged by a playful and hypocritical nihilism? The Baltimore of the Wire is like Sisyphus' boulder, but like the old joke says, at least Sisyphus had job security. Is doing your job pointless because it serves a system of power and not you, or is it pointless because the world is bad and endeavor is hopeless?

I think there's a limit to the degree any of these shows can really criticize capitalism without depicting characters actually struggling with capitalism as an idea. Marxist filmmakers like Bunuel, hurting someone or a victim of someone else. Love means less here than in any of the other shows, possibly because the warping effect of capitalism on the ""frontier"" means that no one can afford to look after anyone else while they're looking out for themselves. No one loves anyone enough to choose not to sacrifice them when the time comes. There are no Marxist Christ figures in Deadwood. That may be why Milch's follow-up project was a mystical Marxist-Christian surfing series (John from Cincinnati).

-Roger Ebert

I recently viewed **Ugetsu** (1953) and, frankly, I was a bit underwhelmed, and I don't feel I understand why the film is considered such a masterpiece.

Now, the detailed period settings, the lack of close ups, etc.  I'm not sure it has ever really appealed to me, though.  Prior to **Ugetsu**, the only of his films that really appealed to me was **The Life of Oharu**, and to a lesser extent, approaching other Japanese directors like Ozu and Kurosawa, aside from **The Life of Oharu**.

I recognize the films strengths relative to other Mizoguchi films.  His characterization was very strong in the film.  I can't think of any other of his films where the characters were so clearly established and define.  In the 7 other of his films I watched, which is present in **Ugetsu** to a lesser degree.

I appreciate the emotions in the film, but, again, it didn't push me to emotional catharsis the way a film like **Tokyo Story** does.

The boat scene is one I often see praised.  I must have missed something.  It was a well shot scene, but these scenes didn't stick out to me as particularly notable either.

So, why is the film considered to great?  I realize film reactions are subjective, and I am entitled to my meh reaction.  I don't intend to forcefully overwrite my feelings just because of the film's praise.  But I just can't help but feel I missed something.

Please

Bringing in the ex-husband to cap off the first act is almost soap-operalike in it's horrible perfect timing.

The casting is strange and seemingly perfect. Nicole Kidman originally played Meg Altman, but that divorce is really what's lighting her up. Kristen Stewart looks like Foster, and feels like a generation-removed copy of Foster in Freaky Friday. Dwight Yoakam wears on Raoul's skin in a way that still creeps me out when I see him. Forest Whitaker is a perfect chump-in-a-hard-place. Jared Leto showed up for filming in those cornrows.

The production is the part I get hung up on the most: that unreal house, no allowance for chance. The result, to me, is an almost impossibly tight, precision film that I can enjoy over &amp; over again.

I loved every second of *Berberian Sound System*. I find this film first and foremost to be an existentialist and psychological drama inside which other genres such as thriller and horror are played out. The horror most obviously comes from the film inside the film, the sound editor/foley artist *Gilderoy* (great acting by **Toby Jones**). We never see any gore or violence, but we're instead immersed in it through the soundscapes of the movie. Even when the sounds are shown to be fake (stabbing cabbages, blending tomatoes), they don't lose any of their impact and creepiness. One less obvious and much more visceral source of horror is the sound studio itself along with its inhabitants such as the perverse and menacing director *Santini*. There's a constant sense of danger and inevitable failure for *Gilderoy* even in the most ordinary of situations such as reimbursing his plane ticket. This is further amplified by the visual style of the movie which contains dreamlike frames and scenes. We get the sense that there is no escape for *Gilderoy*, mistreated and pushed around as he becomes aware of the gravity of the situation he found himself in.

The movie is pretty much open to interpretation especially when considering many scenes towards the end of the film that depict hallucinations and the blending of realities. It appears that *Gilderoy* himself becomes a part of *The Equestrian Vortex* as he starts being overdubbed in Italian and is consumed by the burning film tape. Or is it the other way around

Some hints seem to point to *Gilderoy* being in some sort of personal hell. Apparently the flight he took from London never existed, a film he detests. Furthermore, we never find out why was he chosen to work on the movie. A professional accustomed to working on serene documentaries about nature, hired to work on a horror flick which he can't stand watching. That sounds like hell, doesn't it?

There are bits and pieces in this film that evoke **David Lynch** (*Inland Empire*), and **Roman Polanski** (*Rosmary's Baby*), but all in all *Berberian Sound System* is pretty unique and quite unlike any other film. Oh, the soundtrack by **Broadcast** is also great and the film owes quite a bit of its atmosphere to their music.

One thing that surprised me is that this movie is relatively unknown

*(Note-The words ‘illusion’ and ‘movie’ are interchangeable in the following passages

But I’d extend the symbolism further by asking the question”If the illusion is cinema then who do Angier and Borden represent?”The answer is obvious-they are filmmakers.To generalize=if the illusion represents an act of creation then the 2 magicians are ‘creators’.Talking about these 2 men reveals the most important question ever asked about any piece of media and how you udge the answers defines your understanding of ‘art’ and ‘entertainment’.Lets figure out who Angier is


**“Haw!....The Great…….CAMERON!”**

The best way to describe Angier is that he is the maker of mainstream Hollywood blockbusters.His movies.His illusions are spectacular,the he’ll make the best retro B &amp; W movie ever(Schindler’s List).He is above all,a performer and he lives for the performance.Even his stage is opulent-nothing but the fanciest theatre shall do,no less than a NewYork premiere shall satisfy.He doesn’t ask”Are you watching closely?;he’s made sure you definitely are.His critics will say”By bowing to the whims of the audience you have lost a sense of self” and “it’s a good trick but its overblown-it could be much simpler” but he doesn’t care cause all he wants is that he get the desired effect on people-doesn’t matter if he has to use a drunken double or clones

**The Filmmaker’s Filmmaker/The Magician’s Magician**

Borden is the opposite.He believes that its all about the process than it is about the final product..He could care less about how others view his illusions cause he is satisfied and that’s all that matters.He is making and living art here not just big cheap tricks. He wont exchange the process for accessibility .He is Bergamn before he got famous,the magician in the audience(Angier) is blown away by the immensity of it all.You need atrained eye and atrained mind to see beneath the surface.If you can’t then Borden is a bore;if you can then he is legendary.He is the filmaker’s filmmaker-making the movies only someone like him will understand fully.His critics will tell him”FI nobody’s watching,why do it?”.Borden is a craftsman-he takes pride in the process of creation rather than what he creates.He is pure esoteric,indie cinema.

**Art lies in the process of performance**

So we have established that both Angier and Borden are 2 artists with opposing views and that most directors fall in these 2 categories.But if filmmakers were only either a Borden or an Angier than cinema would be very bland.A movie would either be a Transformers or a La Jette.The only people watching movies would be fanboys and ciname snobs.Luckily there is a 3rd kind of filmmaker and he combines both Angier and Borden.For if Borden loves the process and Angier the performance

The best example of such a man is Francis Ford Coppola.Apocalypse Now is a illusion  both men of The Prestige would be proud of.Its bombastic,you’d think he is crazy but then you’d think 2 men sharing the same life just for a trick is crazy.Its a film for a big stage yet its made with such passion and need for perfection that the proess itself has become stuff of legends.These are the movies and illusions that stay on forever.They are built with passion and their purpose is to create passion.By being both entertainment and art they transcend into something more than a Angier illusion and a Borden trick.So thank the gods for the Coppolas,the Herzogs,the Gillians,the Welles and ofcourse one Chris Nolan

Why does this scene resonate so much with audiences? I want to discuss not only what this scene does for the film narratively

Looking at this scene narratively

We can take a step further though and think about how this scene is commenting on cinema itself. Ricky throughout the film is constantly filming things through a camcorder which the audience sees POV shots of grainy footage. When contrasted against the glossy, we see a noticeable difference. What is Mendes trying to say about film and cinema by using these two different cameras? I believe he is demonstrating the illusion that cinema cameras and Hollywood (the dream factory) can create to deceive an audience. So why is this scene significant? Why does this floating plastic bag shot with a grainy camcorder mean so much to Ricky?

A little bit of background on Ricky, ""Video is a poor excuse, I know. But it helps me remember ... I need to remember..."" Ricky is using film as blinders, not to hide behind the camera or separate himself from the world, but to view it objectively. He wants to extract himself from his family situation, but he can only do it through observing his unedited, objective footage. He is unable to do it through cognitive grasping because his thought and ability to create a narrative in his mind will always bring him back to the old way of viewing life.

This is where I want to discuss the power of cinema and what it does. As viewers we are too often watching film and building a narrative in our minds and when we do this the autonomy of experience gets lost. There are rarely scenes like this in movies where you just have to sit there and watch with very little narrative context yet it moves you so much on an embodied level leaving nothing for the cognitive. Does /r/truefilm like this scene in particular

Here are some other examples from films that tackle this same idea of embodied cognition.

Why do we cheer for the villain? I recently watched The Loved Ones, but the more I thought about it, the more confused I got. At first, I found it really “disrespectful” (for lack of a better word) the way the villain met her demise. It annoyed me that the guy got away without any comeuppance. Through some thought, I realized that the guy didn’t actually do anything wrong. He handled the situation in the best way possible, so what was the problem? This just led me back to the original question. No one goes to a horror film to watch the villain die, unless he or she gets right back up by the end. This is the one thing that separates horror from any other genre. If the villain survives an action film, a western, dream-invading pedophile

I think it comes down to two contradictory positions. We, but we also wish to be the victim. Many film scholars have written on the sadism that is inherent in horror films, particularly slashers and body horror. The audience for a horror film usually consists of outcasts, young people who are more desensitized to violence and who, more than likely, deal or have dealt with bullying in school, or just generally people who do not want to deal with “the man”. The viewing of a horror film allows these viewers to gain power which has been consistently denied them in their day-to-day lives. While a select few people will take this act into their own hands (countless school shooters, the average person harbours resentment towards their peers, the scorned party

The other representation comes from the more suppressed thanatotic impulse. We will refuse to admit this, subconsciously, we do want to die, which accounts for the other reason we watch horror films. Why would we want to die? There are two reasons for this. The first is simple, while in contradiction to the first above reason: As much as we hate the characters who represent our peers, we also wish to be more like them. Who dies in horror films? Other than the occasional adult or “nerd”, they are always attractive, but these people seem to have it figured out. The other reason is more complex. One of reddit’s favourite adages is “don’t stick your dick in crazy”. Ignoring the crude connotations of that phrase, she or he is always sexy, more boring method. Ultimately

This is more observations than strict conclusions

But throughout the film, there are several more references to crucifixion, though I do not remember them all presently.  The Kagemusha eventually dies at the end of the film, which would seem to correlate to Christ, but that doesn't suggest any kind of resurrection, unless you would consider him being rescued in the first place the resurrection.  Another instance of Christianity might be the presence of the priests shown briefly in the film.

Now, the purpose of the Kagemusha is to make people believe that Shingen was still alive, which allowed his armies to keep on and prevented his enemies from attacking.  Another recurring image that I think conveys this theme would be water.  It appears multiple times throughout the film, the lake when Shingen was buried, the pond the Kagemusha stomps through in his nightmare(perhaps this image suggests the extent of the Kagemusha actions, the trivial actions of a thief augmented to the thunder of a giant), and most importantly the image of the dead Kagemusha swept away in the current of the sea, Roger Ebert writes:

&gt;Kurosawa seems to be saying that great human endeavors (in this case, whether or not the beliefs are based on reality -- all that matters is that men accept them. But when a belief is shattered, the result is confusion, destruction, and death. At the end of Kagemusha, for example, the son of the real Lord Shingen orders his troops into a suicidal charge, because they are not on behalf of the sacred person of the warlord.

So

I think it's one of Kurosawa's most thematically complete films, I felt a certain dreamy quality to the film, the absurd premise, the muted quality of the performances cast amid the Samurai social code, and the surreal imagery(particularly the dream sequence), a quality I am certain extends from Kurosawa's renewed emphasis on his painting following his inability to find funding for his films.  I guess it gave the film a certain reality.  It didn't feel like a historical film, or even a modern one.  It felt like a universal work of art.

Take his [youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/MichaelCeraJash), created by someone else. There's a common thread in these shorts; they are all dark, a little strange, and very emotional. I found them to be quite good. In Gregory Go Boom, he does play a character similar to the one he so often plays, but he is so socially inept and also wheelchair-bound, that even when he makes a racist comment, Cera is in an odd crisis where he must convince his boss (Jack O'Connell) to perform backup for a pop song. Cera and O'Connell's performances were great, and would highly recommend them. These were the first signs that he was moving away from his typecast.

Now, Cera got a writing credit on the show at this point, and I have to say this was a very good decision. George-Michael becomes less of ""awkward teenager,"" and more ""trying-to-settle-in"" young adult. He becomes ""overtly-sexual,"" and becomes very successful with his [(fraudulent)](/spoiler) software. I liked the evolution of the character. In ""This Is The End,"" Cera plays an insane coked-up version of himself. This is possibly a result of his ever-similar roles.

There is also an underlying commentary about consumerism, and correlation with these things as almost a religion of their own. The fashion show scene depicts the townsfolk basically being turned into inanimate objects for show, with them getting larger and more absurd as the show goes on. I love the contrast of these constant images of the entire town population living and breathing in a cookie cutter lifestyle that they all willingly participate in, then having the entire movie lead up to the town's Celebration of Specialness. Even during the parade scene, nearly every Shriner/ Majorette/ Stroller pushing mother is identical to the rest. 

I also find it interesting that the entire town essentially does everything together and could be considered one living entity instead of individual people. Nearly all of them work at Vericorp, and even all go to the bar (including the kids!) together on open mic night.

There's several bits of imagery repeated throughout the film that you could either choose to associate with a specific symbolism, dressed alike (which is verbally acknowledged only once, though there are dozens of sets); almost every scene being largely primary colors + green, lack of names for several of the main characters (and instead referring to them by distinguishing traits), etc. 

That said, so that you can really see it for the first time again, and therefore know what it actually looks like.

1) There's something very odd about the continuity of some of the cuts, and then in the next shot they'll be in a *slightly* different position - nothing major, but something that adds to the overall subtle awkward feeling about some of the scenes.

2) Sometimes the shots can be really un-subtle to its detriment. That bit in the art gallery where Madeline is sitting looking at the painting of Carlotta Valdes dressed as Carlotta Valdes. Are those zooms really necessary? Wouldn't there be a better way of showing that her hair and flowers are the same as the painting without drunkenly zooming in to each object so violently?

So this was a total blind buy for me. I had been wanting to pick this one up for a while (since it was announced) solely because the story is very interesting. Or at least, I recently decided to pick it up and I'm so, so glad I did.

The movie is really strange and unlike anything I've ever seen. It really had me captivated from the start of the film. See, but it takes place in a remote mountain village. And the sets are simply incredible. Highly detailed and deep with colors, the whole movie has a dream quality to it. It's not one of these films that feels or looks cheap, no, it's quite enchanting.

The lighting and the manner in which the movie moves along is also worth mentioning. Because it's attempting to be a theater piece, but in this film it's taken to a whole new level. It's so surreal and beautiful. The skies will be rich purple and bright pink, shining through dark green trees. The lights will go completely out and fade into a deep night blue, and a single light will illuminate a character as they speak. In one scene, while the town attempts to punish a thief, everything is under heavy green lights, but they carry torches, and then whatever was in the foreground will slide away and reveal a new scene hidden behind it. Just like in a theater show. It's pure style and man it's fun to watch.

As the story unfolds, and it's not a complicated or challenging story, so there is no *need* for it, but it's a great way to solidify the concept and I love the way it sounded.

The story itself is really fascinating. It's based on Japanese folklore, it's customary for them to be carried to the summit of Mount Narayama and be left to die. The story in the movie is that story, and it focuses on the self-sacrificing character Orin. She's amazing in this movie and I really loved watching her interact with her family as she tries to basically prepare everyone, and herself, for the inevitable journey to the mountain. It's very touching and the whole style of the movie does a great job of accentuating the emotion of the characters.

I'm not sure what else I can say about this movie. I'm so glad I bought it and I really fell in love with it and I highly

1360315867.0,184h7h,Discussion Topic: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,Antiochli,33,14,26,"I'm a fairly die hard Lord of the Rings fan, some friends wanted to get together and go and see it and my arm was twisted, I really wanted to watch the movie and not be constantly irked that something was changed or modified from what I'd been expecting. Movies are not books

I thought that the duality of Bilbo Baggins and Thorin Oakenshield served the story quite well. Apparently The Hobbit will be part one of a trilogy, one can hardly fathom the callused nature a man might adopt after hundreds of years of toil, strife and loss all now hinging on one little Hobbit who can't even begin to relate his own life to yours, one little Hobbit who's apparent selfishness and lack of empathy at what you're attempting to do will cause utter ruin for all. Resentment indeed.

At first (again my book bias rearing it's head) I was irritated with the Azog antagonist and the whole Orc pursuit throughout the story. However, even though what happens at the end of the movie is virtually identical to the book the antagonists in question are not, nor is the mended internal strife of the company. By creating a vendetta enemy with Thorin, and a story-long pursuit of that enemy you allow a natural progress of typical ebb and flow of story. You allow the story to end chronologically where you need it to, while also giving the singular entity (The Hobbit part One) a satisfying ending.

I thought it was smart to use the Azog/Orc pursuers as a way to simultaneously bridge Thorin and Bilbo's conflict. Even though it does feel a bit ""typical"" it was still fitting and allowed the various conflicts to wrap up tightly. You allow Bilbo to show his mustard by intervening in what would otherwise be Thorin's death thwarting Azog's plan

On the other hand I thought that the movie was far too action heavy. Any opportunity for slashing and dashing was taken, they still managed to throw a massive battle into it. The mountain goblins sequence late in the movie played out to me like an over the top two thirds comedic one third tense chase scene that should have been a third as long. Not just the length of that chase scene but also the sheer overload of frame cuts made my head hurt, I could barely focus on what was happening (possibly intentional) before the frame would cut to another far too busy perspective, and on and on.

Although I can understand a need to introduce the audience (and Gandalf) to the Necromancer and Dol Guldur early in the film(s) I have to say that personally the choice of character with which to make that introduction is a bit odd

Initially I was uncertain how I felt about the films opening sequence. I clearly understand that the audience needs to be made aware of what the historical significance of what the Dwarves are undertaking is, leaving Bilbo with this monstrous impression that will haunt him in the nights. On the other hand that slow build might not be commercially viable, and the way they handled it with the prologue was satisfactory, and it also recalls the prologue in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" film.

**Jean-Luc Godard's King Lear [1987]**

When I tell people that Godard made a near incomprehensible Shakespeare adaption starring Molly Ringwald, talks out of the side of his mouth, which coupled with Godard's accent makes him impossible to understand and is called ""Professor Pluggy"", they usually back away and call the authorities. It's a film that I sounds as if it shouldn't exist: Godard signed the contract to make it at a restaurant in Cannes ...on a napkin, he claims to have only read the first and last three pages of the play he was adapting and he seems to have driven original writer Normal Mailer away on purpose. As well as all that, (it also marks Julie Delpy's second Godard role, but it's quite small) Quentin Tarantino used to lie to casting directors by claiming to have been in this film. 

Godard's King Lear is a very odd film, in it's purest form, is that in an alternative world William Shakespeare's ancestor, Shakespeare 5th, has been tasked with restoring Shakespeare's plays after Chernobyl wiped out most the human race, and nearly all culture (remember that Godard quote about his goal being destruction of culture?). He ends up staying in one place, pondering whether he is writing the characters, looking for meaning in these people that surround him. Ringwald and Meredith play Cordelia and Learo and their lines appear to all come from Shakespeare, and William Shakespeare 5th trying to find out what he can from Professor Pluggy. He repeats scenes. He shuffles titles cards around (commonly repeating a black card reading NO THING

Godard's claim to have only read six pages of Lear are clearly not true. He follows the themes of the play, all with different versions. Godard further muddles by adding in his own Shakespeare. At one point, Shakespeare 5th claims to have 99% of the play recovered. Yet, we haven't seen hardly any of it. Cordelia's sisters, Regan and Goneril, aren't banished but absent from the very beginning. There seems to be no-one in this version of Lear but Lear and Cordelia. The play is no longer about power, but virtue, her love (one title that is repeated is Power vs. Virtue, sometimes lit by candles

Woody Allen supposedly plays ""the fool"" but this amounts to little more than a cameo at the end as a film editor named Mr. Alien. Peter Sellars' William Shakepeare 5th, not it's contents. Godard had long been experimenting with form by this point, and he finally perfected his playing here. He creates a film that succeeds as *a film* not as a result of great direction or great performance. 

There are bad points: Godard's gift for image

A film like [Kes](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064541/) is direct in its social criticism and doesn't 'insist on a lack of agency' for the teachers who bully Billy. Should how a film agrees with your worldview affect how good you assess a film's greatness?

Critic [Pauline Kael](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Kael) describes what's great about De Sica's film Shoeshine .
&gt;[...]after one of those terrible lovers' quarrels that leave one in a state of incomprehensible despair. I came out of the theater, 'Well I don't see what was so special about that movie.' I walked up the street, crying blindly, no longer certain whether my tears were for the tragedy on the screen, the hopelessness I felt for myself, or the alienation I felt from those who could not experience the radiance of Shoeshine. For if people cannot feel Shoeshine, what can they feel?... Later I learned that the man with whom I had quarreled had gone the same night and had also emerged in tears. Yet our tears for each other, as Shoeshine demonstrates

Both Kes and Shoeshine left me with tears streaming down my face but I think Shoeshine is a greater film even though Kes has a stronger message and I related to it more. Does personal preference fit into a certain theory about film criticism? Are changes in polls like the Sight &amp; Sound poll because of a change in taste which reflects social change more than the refinement of film criticism?

The discussion for Grin Without A Cat will be delayed until tomorrow (about 24 hours after the posting of this one). For the schedule of our future discussions, if you haven't yet seen Potemkin and have a spare hour and 10 minutes

Now... Potemkin! As before, please go ahead and post them.

With this film, and the eventually successful [1917 revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1917) that the film allegorizes. Just a few years later, Eisenstein directed  [October](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018217/) about the 1917 revolution, that is definitely worth checking out if you were interested by Potemkin.

I'll  start us off with a few questions to think about. Please don't feel obligated to answer these

**Some questions:**

* From a purely technical perspective

* The film doesn't really have a ""lead"" character. Does this work in its favor?

* Originally

 &gt;""The spirit of mutiny swept the land. A tremendous

 It was later

 &gt;""Revolution is war. Of all the wars known in history, just and truly great war...In Russia this war has been declared and won""

 What is the significance of this change? In addition to its political meaning

* What are your thoughts on the character of the priest? What do you think about the scene where Vakulinchuk says ""Beat it

* What was the purpose of the scene where they beat up the person who says ""Kill the Jews!""?

* In 1943 the film was[ ""modernized""](http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990DE5D81530E53BBC4D51DFBE668388659EDE) (i.e. changed greatly) by the English and made into a film about resisting the Nazis. How do you feel about this?

* Could a film about socialist/communist revolution made today be as effective as Potemkin was in its time?

* Could a film advocating capitalism be as powerful as Potemkin?

* What later

* Propaganda is often viewed in a negative light. The word is often used insultingly to mean a work full of lies and extreme bias. Is this a just use of the word? Can propaganda be positive

* There have been [numerous soundtracks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battleship_Potemkin#Soundtracks) created for this film. The director felt that a new one should be made every 25 years to reflect the current times. If you've seen multiple versions

* This is one of the oldest films about revolution. What about it is completely outdated

I know I already linked to it

**Edit:** I'm once again delaying the Grin Without a Cat discussion until tomorrow(12/17). This will allow the Potemkin one to grow a little more and will also allow me a bit more time to construct a few good discussion prompts and research the film more myself.

Now, but it's fast, the plot is somehow original within its own genre (idiots involve in a crime they eventually botch up) and the overall result is a pretty decent black comedy.

I know a lot of people is hating the film because of Michael Bay (and probably The Rock). I wonder if these people liked Spring Breakers. I personally didn't like it. It was boring, extremely wasted, and the ending disappointing no matter what you come up with to explain such incoherence. Pretentious without intelligence behind it. The aesthetics were cool, though. That's it.

To me, both films exploit the beauty/hotness culture, drugs culture, both films are also shot in the same location (Florida). And the final lesson seemed pretty much the same: on this way you will end up dead or in jail.

Can you see these similarities between the films? Do you think Spring Breakers is more intelligent than Pain &amp; Gain?

**EDIT**: I noticed some of you focus on the director's career. I'm specifically talking about these two movies. Try to leave your hate for Bay (and your love for Korine) aside from the discussion.

1376500241.0,1kcxjo,[Theme: Westerns] #3. Winchester '73 (1950),AstonMartin_007,21,2,9,"#Introduction

With the demand for more psychologically complex and morally ambiguous films after WWII, a story later slyly referenced in *Vertigo* (1958).

After the release and critical success of Billy Wilder's *Double Indemnity* (1944), and dozens of directors were tasked with turning out B-movie imitations. One of these was Anthony Mann, who between 1944-1950 directed roughly ~10 low-budget noirs. With cinematographer John Alton, Mann exploited the shadows and angles of noir to disguise deficiencies in production values. As his success and reputation grew, his eye turned towards Westerns as a new genre to infuse his noir talents with. With *Border Incident* (1949), he straddled the gap before fully committing to his 1^st Western, *The Furies* (1950).

With James Stewart also on the lookout for psychologically complex roles in Western settings

James Stewart had done 1 prior Western, at the time they were not box-office successes, to say nothing of Stewart's lesser-known efforts. Faced with a career downturn, Steward chose Westerns as a venue for showcasing his acting range. The success of *Winchester '73* would reinvigorate his career and pave the way for 16 more Westerns, 4 of those with Mann and 3 with John Ford. His financial arrangements would also profoundly affect the studio/actor relationship; For the 1^st time, he would waive a salary and instead be paid a percentage of the gross, a practice that continues to this day. The windfall from *Winchester '73* would guarantee him a degree of artistic freedom in his subsequent choice of roles.

The role of the Indian chief is played by Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis plays a soldier in one of their earliest roles.

1375792666.0,1jt32h,Carlos Reygadas's 'Post Tenebras Lux' (2012),ben_smith_123,24,4,2,"Below is a short review of Post Tenebras Lux that I originally posted on my [blog.](http://www.shelfheroes.com/2013/08/post-tenebras-lux.html) Have you seen it? What did you take away from it?

—

Beginning with a startlingly beautiful scene of a young girl alone in an ominous field at dusk, as a series of vignettes with a few recurring characters and an elusive plot. The closest it comes to a conventional narrative is with the story of Juan (Adolfo Jiménez Castro) and Nathalia (Nathalia Acevedo), a middle-class Mexican couple who, having moved their family to the country for a more wholesome life, find Juan’s problems with addiction and violence unsettle their apparently idyllic life. The film slips back and forth through time without explanation depicting the couple and their children, a local tradesman, a French orgy, expectations twist from one scene to the next.

One of its problems is the sheer amount going on. Each segment apparently explores new themes and is inflected with slightly different styles (the influence of several European arthouse directors is clear), and ‘Post Tenebras Lux’ rests precariously upon it. Raising multiple unanswered questions it’s hard to get a handle on what director Carlos Reygadas is trying to achieve here, and it appears more like a personal study. What it does capture beautifully is human frailty, the characters at the mercy of the vast imposing natural landscape or their own vices and desires.

The cinematography is exceptional, remains authentically cinematic but keeps a feeling of claustrophobia and closeness that would be absent on a wider screen. An intriguing, almost kaleidoscopic vignette is also present in most of the scenes, distorting the edge of the lens in a way that mimics human sight and our peripheral vision. This amounts to an alluring spectacle that all but physically draws you in to these strangers' lives.

Despite its flaws 'Post Tenebras Lux' makes fantastic use of an air of mystery and short, 'Post Tenebras Lux' translates as “Light after darkness”, a beautiful phrase that perhaps communicates more about Reygadas’s intent.
