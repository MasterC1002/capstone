1341450109.0,w20ua,"Alright guys, let's squash the sentiment that Ubisoft is going to make Assassin's Creed 3 into a patriotic circlejerk right here. ",int3rcept,710,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/w20ua/alright_guys_lets_squash_the_sentiment_that/, killing legions of US special ops soldiers in the process.

So let me put the copypasta here and we can focus all the debate about patriotism onto this thread. I think all the mods here can agree that letting this place degenerate into a constant soapbox for self-loathing Americans and self-righteous non-Americans will not further or enhance any discussion of Assassin's Creed whatsoever. If we're going to duke it out, white, and blue fireworks above a scorched earth of brown people.

The follow is the copypasta:

I've posted this in other threads before. This is addressing the inevitable flux of people who will come in here and claim that AC3 will be a vehicle for American bias and propaganda:

* Strangely, turns out to be the ultimate villain](/spoiler ""Assassin's Creed 1"").

* If this game was set in the French Revolution

* The trailers and artwork prominently feature the Betsy Ross flag because the game is set during the American Revolution. It's immediately recognizable and eye-catching. If Ubisoft made an AC game set during the Bolshevik Revolution and used [the Red Banner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_flag) for cover art

* You can see in this [trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pUhraVG7Ow) that Connor is indifferent

* Killing a bunch of weekend warrior minutemen doesn't make your protagonist look badass. Dismantling a finely trained unit of professional redcoats makes your protagonist look badass. 

* Speaking of the Continental Army

* The game takes place over a period of 30 years, and after the Revolutionary War. Anyone who has learned US history would know that British troops and Hessians would be the ones patrolling and guarding towns before and during the war, thus the great majority of enemies Connor kills would be redcoats, British Templars, and probably some colonial Templars with loyalist sympathies. Connor's targets *after* the war would be American templars guarded by American soldiers since the British are expelled by then, but it would be stupid to create trailers of the final chapters of the game for obvious reasons.

* As another poster mentioned

* If Connor wasn't allied in some way with the colonists then where could he find safe haven? Again

* Though its association with the United States is convenient, but AC 3's emphasis on making Connor feel like a predator probably pushed the design team to inject more of a lupine feel into him. He's portrayed as both an eagle and a wolf. Also, the trademark vision mechanic of the series is called [Eagle Vision](http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Eagle_Vision).

* All the AC protagonists maintained some sort of light political allegiance. For example, the Assassins had the support of the local population. Why would Assassins in Colonial America be any different and why is it so objectionable if it's clearly an ongoing theme?

* The Assassins always side with whichever faction is giving power to the common people. This is why in the lore, supported the Bolshevik Revolution but killed Stalin 40 years later. Although Stalin was a communist, he was also a Templar that tried to focus power within the elite and control the proletariat. Political and national affiliations mean nothing to Assassins. In the Revolutionary War, the colonists are the underdogs. Naturally, many of the Founding Fathers would be Assassins because they're breaking off from a monarchy that has power concentrated within the upper echelons of society. Once the United States is founded, this changes.

Have some faith, Ubisoft Montreal has always done right by me. In my opinion, Ubisoft and Rockstar easily have the best writers in the industry. I doubt they'd change gears so suddenly.

Look at [all the shit this franchise has produced](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed). There are five games in the main series alone with a slew of supporting comics, and books. They've had many opportunities to pander and sell out but they haven't. If anything, the games are biased towards a leftist and Assassin perspective while the supplementary media highlight some of the very negative qualities of the Assassins while showing the Templar Order in a more sympathetic light. Believing that Ubisoft would abandon this design direction simply because the game is set in America is insulting to the company and quite frankly reveals a lot of bigoted, preconceived notions of what American fans of the series want.

By the way, and Joseph Stalin to start World War II. Let that sink in for you. Assassin's Creed says that FDR, consistently voted by scholars as one of the greatest presidents of all time, was a mass-murdering conspirator that worked with Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin to engineer the bloodiest and most horrific war in human history in order to form a new world government.

That doesn't sound like an American bias.",,t5_2s6v6,1341618462.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/w20ua/alright_guys_lets_squash_the_sentiment_that/

I won't say how, here in the UK.  I'll leave it at that.  Edit - I would like to clarify this was on the 360.  Physical copy, not the torrent.

He called me to come round as he knew I was aching for the game's release.

I'm not trolling.  I'm not trying to write this to make it LOOK like I've played the game when I haven't.  This is no review

He had just finished sequence 3 and was about to start sequence 4.

Obviously

AC 3 is by far and away the single

Every single thing that I saw, surprisingly so.  I actually looked around and thought ""If it were just Boston and New York, this is a game in itself.)  The frontier is just OMFGNOWAI massive (childish I know, but god, it's so damn big), and is FULL.  Unlike Red Dead Redemption, there is SO much to do in the Frontier.  Animals are abundant, but god

That waypoint ended up being like 400m away, a good 10 minutes to run to it. 

Seriously, but clues pop up here and there which you can analyze, and like in RDR, animals can be found in specific areas (beavers for example (spoilers?) can be found by rivers, bears by caves and mountain sides etc).

The trees feel a little too well designed.  In free running aspects that is.  A bit too manufactured.  Like they've been placed to ensure there is always somewhere to free-run.  A little artifitial.

It's the little things though.  Rats run around in cities.  Squirrels can be seen in trees as you sweep through effortlessly.  Eagle cries.  The sound of snow under foot.  It's all amazing.

Oh

EVERYONE is doing something.  Hustle and bustle makes the city feel alive.  Everywhere you look there is something to see.  Dust and fog sweep across the streets.  Winter changes everything.  The number of people on the screen in the cities is so realistic.  People are chopping wood, selling produce, bantering, cats and dogs roam around freely.  It's so realistic.

The frontier feels alive. Squirrels in the trees.  Animals huddle together.  Eagles soar and cry overhead.  Crickets in the grass etc.

Overall though

The animations, SO detailed AND SO SMOOTH, seriously, I saw 1 moment where the FPS dropped, but it was completely understandable as to why), the FREEDOM, the acting.

The combat is..gleefully and unashamedly, the fluidity of attack combos, combat can be difficult, but still easier than I thought it would be (never died in combat, and the gun volley needs to have its' damage increased in a patch.  Its the only disappointing thing I noticed.  5 guys shoot you at the same time and you lose like 1/4 health unfortunately.  It's couldnt be made more obvious when they're about to shoot, but its still possible to get hit by them easily.  If no one is near you, you're in trouble if your health is low as you cant dodge the volley.)  Unarmed combat is awesome and there is some great bone snapping animations.  Guns take SO long to load, as guns back then were notorious for long reloading.  Force the swab down the barrel

There are no limbs flying everywhere and guts spilling out or anything that bad, such strength, yet can dodge and counter almost every attack if you get your timing right.

But those graphics.

They're bite-the-back-of-your-hand beautiful.  Seriously.  We had a moment on a tree branch, Assassin style, spinning the camera around slowly, just looking at the scenery below.  0 effect on the FPS.  The draw distance is obviously limited by the console hardware (trees far in the distance look a bit..well...drawn 2D), but I was still damn impressed.  It was like playing stock Skyrim all over again without the graphics mods etc.

There were some weird horse spawning glitches, clothing clipping through objects, weird shadows, fluctuating lighting in the same camera angle.  But I guess these can be ironed out maybe in a future patch.

For those that DONT care about the graphics though

I'll just say this:  Based on what I saw in my, the wait has seriously...

SERIOUSLY been worth it.

* So for starters you have a main weapon


* While in combat, A (X) to break their defense, or hold down B (Circle) to parry their attacks.


* So, you're gonna have to do quite a bit of counter-attacks (plus, that's where all the cool moves and combos are). 


* When an enemy is about to attack you

          * X (Square) to use your main weapon
          * Y (Triangle) to use your tool
          * B (Circle) to throw them
          * A (X) to disarm them

* If 2 enemies are attacking you at once

 
* The problem a lot of people are having, it hinders more than it helps. What I've found while playing, is that if you hold down RT (R1) while in combat, you can block enemies' attacks and go into the slowmo animation, but the game doesn't allow you to follow up with any of the 4 buttons (X, Y, B, Triangle


* Some people are complaining that they *always* throw people when they counter


* The only thing holding down RT (R1) is useful for is when you want to pick up a weapon on the ground in the middle of combat.


* Now, or a Grenadier (The big guys with backpacks) about to perform a heavy attack or throw a grenade. If someone is aiming a gun at you, quickly move toward the nearest enemy and tap A (X) to grab him and use him as a human shield. If it is a heavy attack, just tap B (Circle) once, and you will roll out of the way; usually you roll behind him, so if you're quick you can assassinate him from behind with X (Square). If it's a grenade, press RT (R1) and run away from it; they don't have a very big blast radius. I'm not sure if there's anything you can do with the grenades, so I haven't really gotten to play around with them yet.


* Tougher opponents, and the captains, can't always be killed with regular attacks or regular counter-attacks. You'll have to mix it up. Try countering with your tool, or attacking from a distance with a ranged weapon. Your best bet is to usually either break their defense with A (X), or counter-disarm them and then quickly pick up the weapon they dropped before they can pick it back up.


Thanks for reading guys! If you have any information you'd like me to add, feel free to let me know. Happy Hunting!

Twenty years ago my parents divorced

In the end my father took my brother and I stayed with my mother. 

Move forward those twenty years and the two of us hadn't seen each other in so long. He would try and send letters but my dad would never mail them

Having been tracked down by my brother we began talking online and getting to know each other again. He and I are both gamers and the topic of assassin's creed had come up many many times. I told him it was one of my favorite series. (His own being Dragon Age)

Two days ago I come home from work to find two large boxes sitting on my porch. On the box was a drawn assassin logo.

These were inside.
[ The things he sent me.](http://imgur.com/a/WsKfb)

Along with a picture of him and his family. 

He and I bonded again over Assassin's Creed and we're going to meet in a month.

TL;DR : The brother I hadn't seen in 20 years and I bonded over a game and he sent me cool shit.

EDIT: We're going meet in two weeks instead of a month. 

And for anyone that wants to know here is the rest of that shelf.

The upgrade in gameplay from 1 to 2 was astronomical. When brotherhood came out


They'll ask if they should start from the beginning or go to the latest game. 

""This isn't Starwars


But AC1 always turns them off from the series. At the time


The gameplay and story is extremely repetitive compared to the others and the world seems so dead. NPCs walk around like zombies and I often found myself just killing guards out of boredom. The endgame is practically nonexistent


Now I just recommend that they start at 2 and only play 1 if they really want to.


Altaïr is supposed to be one of the grandmasters


Any thoughts about it? Would anyone else enjoy a remake at some time? Maybe when Ubisoft finishes the main saga that they have going on right now?

**Part 1**: The Old World

The game opens in 1792. Connor is on his way to France, sensing the growing trouble in his native country, had attempted to flee back to America but was imprisoned. Knowing no one else in the world has the same skills, Lafayette has asked for Connor's help in escaping from his captors, a kindness Connor is willing to show given Lafayette’s past efforts.

However, Connor becomes swept up in the revolutionary fever. Surrounded by French rebels who call out for liberty, equality, and brotherhood, he becomes an object of curiosity – an American Indian in France during its most tumultuous period. 

Noticing the insignia on his tomahawk, having been disillusioned by General Washington’s policies against Native Americans, is unsure of any man who comes preaching sudden, radical change. Connor stays in France, and attempts to cool to violence of the revolution. He has matured since his thuggish youth.
 
 
 
**Part 2**: The End of the Assassins

In October 1793, and her body defiled after the execution, his anger becomes too much. 

He sides with the broken Girondins, targeting the corrupted European Assassins and the powerful politicians in the new French Republic. It culminates in 1794, with Connor killing Robespierre and Saint-Just during the Thermidor Reaction. 
 
 
 
**Part 3**: A New Leader

Returning to his original mission, the prisons of King Friedrich Wilhelm are too great and Connor cannot free his friend. He returns to France where he meets a man esposing egalitarian principles similar to his own. This man, born in a remote and poor French province, has risen from the lowest ranks of the aristocracy through his military and tactical genius and, before the age of 30, is now one of the most powerful politicians in France. Connor quickly befriends and becomes a staunch ally of Napoleon Bonaparte, helping eliminate Templar based rivals who seek the position of First Consul.

In 1797, which they do. The Marquis becomes a powerful ally, using his widespread fame to help Connor find new military technology to improve his combat skills and the abilities of his ship, the Aquila. Connor attempts to become Napoleon’s chief advisor, but finds Napoleon being seduced by a silver-tongued sycophant named Talleyrand. Napoleon in 1800 becomes First Consul of France and immediately enacts a civil code which reforms the national administration, creates effective states, regulates public finance, and establishes public education. However
 
 
 
**Part 4**: A Free Haiti and the High Seas

In 1802, and Toussaint’s death by trickery at the hands of the colonists greatly angers our Assassin. Napoleon’s Polish troops fighting in Haiti, hungry and exhausted, begin to see the Haitian desire for self-governance as very similar to their own. They switch sides, turning the tide of the war permanently in the Haitians' favor. France has lost its revenue from Haiti’s sugar and is forced to abandon their dreams of a New World empire. Louisiana is sold to the Americans.

Connor’s skill on the seas has made him infamous, instead of the choppy Atlantic. Two hundred years before, Spain had lost its entire fleet in a poorly planned attack on Britain ruined by a storm. Nelson is determined that England will not repeat Spain’s mistake.  In 1805, Connor and Nelson attack the combined French and Spanish forces at Trafalgar. Nelson is killed early in the battle, forcing Connor to take command of the Navy. Leading a smaller fleet than the French, Connor dives into the sea and sneaks onboard the French flagship, the Bucentaure. He kills Admiral Frederico Gravina and captures Admiral Villaneuve. France will never rule the seas again.
 
 
 
**Part 5**: Mexico City

To be released as DLC
 
 
 
**Part 6**: The fall of Napoleon 

Talleyrand has a secret meeting with Connor. For the first time in his life, the Revolution, and Napoleon. Talleyrand knows Napoleon has doomed France, the now-Emperor’s worldview poisoned by ego and his Templar advisors, Talleyrand wants Connor's help in destroying him. Connor reluctantly agrees, but first he is called back to the New World. 

It is 1812, Connor returns and joins the British against the Americans. He decides to attack the US at its center of power and leads an invasion of Washington, D.C. At the front of a superior British army, his position earned through his performance at Trafalgar, he torches the White House. His conversion to a nationless freedom fighter complete, he has made enemies out of the country he helped create.

Preparing to return to Europe, an aging Connor, now in his 60’s, makes his way to the tiny island in the South Atlantic. Sneaking onto Napoleon’s estate, he dispatches Napoleon’s elite private guard and confronts Napoleon in his bedroom. The old warrior is stronger than his years would suggest, he nearly kills Connor in the ensuing struggle. Finally, the Assassin is able to stab the former Emperor in the stomach. However
 
 
 
**Part 7**: The Mentor

A nearly dead Connor is smuggled by British Assassins from St. Helena to the closest safe port. He ends up recovering from his wounds in Montevideo, made in Connor’s image, with no political allegiances or national identity. The order is small, their predecessors have been largely eliminated by Connor for their support of the Reign of Terror. It is in Montevideo that Connor discovers his greatest student, an Italian by the name of Giuseppe Garibaldi.

•DOUBLE KILLS: To perform a cinematic double kill (not a double counter, target an enemy that is standing close to another foe. Angle and hold the left stick towards him, then double tap the tool button. As long as the two enemies are close enough (and you have a ranged or heavy tool equipped), Connor will execute a stylish double kill (using up 1 qty of the equipped tool). 

•DOUBLE ASSASSINATIONS: Double assassinations can be performed at any time using either the hidden blades or fists. To perform a low-profile double assassination, run towards (or pull the right trigger when close by) a pair of enemies and tap the attack button. This same procedure can be used for air and horse double assassinations.  
        
•NOTORIETY RESETING: Fast travel anywhere to reset your notoriety.
 
•SURVIVING ANY FALL: Fast travel while falling from high places to prevent desynchronization. 

•UNDERGROUND FAST TRAVEL: While exploring the Boston and New York undergrounds

•FULFILL ALL MISSION CONSTRAINTS (Post-Epilogue): Animus hacks don't affect previous mission constraints and can be used to make memory replays easier. 
 
•FREE AMMO REFILLS: You can craft saddlebags for your horse that allow you to refill your consumables for free at any time. 

•TRIPPING ENEMIES: In combat against an enemy that you’ve disarmed

•SAVING DISPUTED CONVOYS: Your Assassin recruits can save any of your land convoys that are under attack. 

•CATCH FLEEING NPCS: Use the rope darts or poison darts to slow down enemies that run quickly. This will not kill them (instantly at least) and helps you catch up. 

•ANIMAL DISCOVERY: While completing the hunting map

•AVOIDING FIRING LINES: If you can't find a human shield in time
 
•REDUCE CONVOY TRAVEL RISK: Send supplies to the same merchant over and over to avoid increasing the risk on each convoy. For naval convoys
 
•EASY NAVIGATION: While sprinting, angle the left stick towards nearby grip holds to catch them.    ",,False,,t5_2s6v6,False,360,

Yes

I for one haven't seen much improvement in the COD franchise since MW.

In fact

Assassin's Creed, there is a clear uphill on the improvement and innovation chart when compared to COD.

AC has always been entertaining and even somewhat educational. The guys that work on the franchise have poured their hearts and souls into the projects and it shows. Comparing AC to COD solely on release dates is unwarranted and unfair.

I, because I really care about the universe and the story and I'm invested. Yeah, I might not be picking the games up at launch, but to be fair I haven't done that since Halo CE.

Bottom line

As much as I consider games an art form

And this franchise has some of the brightest and ambitious minds

I welcome every new addition to the franchise and I try not to compare any of those games to anything else.

If we all did that

Too long to read, but those are my two cents. I love COD and AC in no way am trying to call anyone a fanboy, but the levels of love for the two are different. In no way will I try to compare them to each other and say ""OH THIS FRANCHISE IS TURNING INTO CRAP"" just because AC is releasing every year.

AC has always tried new things, and that's more than I can say for COD in all respect.  ",,False,,t5_2s6v6,False,,

Desmond knows his fate. He says his goodbyes to his father, there is a long, desolate yet ornate walkway ahead of Desmond. His friends and family slowly and sadly let him walk alone down the path.

Music starts playing. This music exactly (I'd open in a new tab as you read - http://youtu.be/qfFvOt5GPr8?t=2m29s). Sprinting becomes disabled and Desmond starts moving slower and slower. Suddenly, assassinating key figures, and ending up with an Apple. The images fade. To his right, he sees a young Ezio scaling the rooftops in his first race. The images go very quickly, and soon he has the Assassin's Robes, and eventually he too holds an Apple. The images start flowing together towards the middle of Desmond's destination. Eagle vision becomes permanently on and all of the images of his ancestors coalesce at the center with an impossibly beautiful light. As Desmond gets closer, the light turns into an image of the sun, but we know it is just his fear of his imminent death. Once he is close enough, just an option to Interact with Juno's lock.

Some of you hated him for his lack of usefulness. Some of you detest him for the lack of character. Some of you dislike him because his face looks weird and changes from AC1 all the way through AC3. But let us not remember him by his faults but by that which he has done for us. We shall remember him as the man who delivered us from the end so that we may live and continue our duty. So I implore you my fellow Assassins to join me in a moment of silence. Let us give him give thanks for all he has done. Let us honor his memory by continuing our fight against the vile Templars and Juno. And let us always remember his selfless sacrifice.

They aren't so much sequels to AC2 as they are continuations. Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood could just as easily be renamed Assassin's Creed 2, with the climax being  the end of AC2, the falling action in ACB, and the resolution in ACR.

That's the same reason the next game is Assassin's Creed 3

So to everyone asking ""Do I need to play Brotherhood and Revelations? How much do they add to the story?"" Well, you'd have missed so much character and plot development, you wouldn't have much of an idea of what's going on. If you did only watch the first third, and went straight to the next one, you would, at the very least, read a plot synopsis or summary online.

1362191533.0,19i2u4,Why AC IV: Black Flag is the right choice for Ubisoft....,IFeelLikeAndy,232,32,66,"*I was skeptical about Black Flag

Assassin's Creed 1 followed Altair Ibn La'Ahad for a brief but important moment of his life and had an ending that nobody saw coming and wanted many people begging for more, whom we watched grow from *literally* the moment he was born, to a brash teenager, then into a brave man at the age of 40. The game ends at a very abrupt and strange moment in Ezio's life much like the first game's ending which was at a strange moment in Altair's life, so it wouldn't be a surprise if the next game didn't complete Ezio's story, but Ezio seemed more developed so another game was made featuring him as the main protagonist. 

Assassin's Creed Brotherhood was the next game continuing right where the events in ACII left off and helped build Ezio into a fully developed and lovable character. At the end of AC:B Ezio has finally gotten the revenge he's been seeking for all his life and his story was over, Assassin's Creed: Revelations was made and gave fans the closure both Ezio **and** Altair deserved, by letting player's experience first hand what they did with their lives after the events in AC1 and AC:B, whilst also adding to the main story and developing a game like no other.

With Ezio and Altair's stories now over a new protagonist was needed for ACIII, also known as Connor Kenway, son of Haytham Kenway. Without knowing, player's experienced Haytham's life for about 1/3 of the main story arc. While playing, we learn much about Haytham's life while also learning about Connor's mother, Ziio, his family, Connor. Once we finally do play as Connor

But Ubisoft isn't stupid

***""What is a man but the sum of his memories?"" -Clay Kaczmarek (Subject 16)***

This is where Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag comes into all this talk about character development and the past. By letting us play as Connor's grandfather we will learn more about Connor's past as well as Haytham's

* Fences with gaps in the bottom can be used to lose pursuers. Sprint at the gap and your character will slide under the fence.
* Holding A or B while sprinting lets you jump over small obstacles without climbing on them.
* You can only perform dual assassinations with the hidden blades or your fists. The easiest way to do this is an air assassination or a sprinting assassination (keep pressing ""assassinate"" as you sprint at your targets). 
* You can cancel broadside shots in the naval portions by re-orienting the camera forward. Useful if you don't want to waste a volley and wait for a reload.
* On a related note
* The best way to defeat tougher enemies (who are resistant to counter) is by disarming them. On Xbox
* Alternatively
* When using the rope dart
* When you see the yellow triangle
* Powder kegs do heavy damage to allies!! Be very careful using them on missions where allies can take damage.
* You can reload your pistol while running
* In naval battles, the enemy will fire after you come out of it, and you'll take damage.
* While falling
* Animals will fuck your shit up if you let them. Get those button combos right.",,t5_2s6v6,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/138ffw/gameplay_tips_and_tricks_you_wish_you_knew/

- New aiming system in naval combat. Now you can control the height and distance of your shots

- New “heavy shot” for naval combat. Deadly up close

- New naval archetype, the longest ranged weapon at sea. Aim with the spyglass for maximum accuracy and then shoot. 

- Your crew is very important. You mainly need them for naval combat and boarding, finding them in deserted islands (“shipwrecked sailors”), saving them from hostile situations,… 

- You can find collectable songs that you can get your crew to sing in your voyages.

- Spaniards and British are hostile to each other the whole game, they will battle. You can help one side, the other, or attack both if you are powerful enough.

- Your first mate is a big black man called Adewale. If he sees anything potentially interesting to you

- Forts can be taken down with your ship

- In plantations, but if you get detected bells will ring and you will be surrounded by new types of enemies.

- Guards will be tougher than in any previous AC. “Gunners” are so deadly

- You can now free aim with your guns. If you want to kill your enemies quickly, which means there are different types of ammo. You can put your enemies to sleep, poison them and make them go berserk,… If you poison them, they’ll attack anyone they see, including animals or their own friends.

- There’s no brotherhood(assassin recruit system), you have to take care of your pirate crew. 

- When Edward starts being trained by assassins

- The main islands (Cuba, especially in Cuba. You can’t go too far into the interior, tough. 

- Port Royale is in the game

- The whole world opens to you after about an hour into the game. It’s done this way to make sure the player won’t feel overwhelmed at the beginning.

- There are LGS o “linear game sequences”. Some of these missions take place outside of the Caribbean.

- When you plunder a ship you can make it part of Kenway’s fleet

Finally finished with the series! (for now)

I tried my hardest to make this movie shorter, such as the boat scenes in the beginning and recruiting Hickey and Pitcairn, as well as a lot of the stuff with young Connor. I also trimmed down Desmond's missions quite a bit. I ended up cutting over 20 minutes from my original edit, but if I cut anything else I'd likely be sacrificing storytelling.

One scene I debated cutting out was Connor's argument with Haytham on the rooftop, and not vital to understanding the story. However, I thought the acting and character development in that scene, as well as its importance to the themes of this story as well as AC as a whole made the scene too important to cut.

I have some ideas for other series, Tomb Raider, or the Last of Us. 

One thing I want to note, and the two DLC sequences distracted from the main plot too much, and nothing much was missed by skipping them.

* The objectives often take away from the game experience rather than adding to it and it discourage creativity. For example (AC:III spoiler) [spoiler](#s ""in the Bunker Hill battle, you could always to it your way anyways, but then the game kind of slam in your face and say ""YOU DID IT WRONG!"" when the mission is over.

* The objectives are often random and doesn't make any sense. For example: ""kill the wolves without using ranged weapons""

* The secondary objectives often hint at what is going to come

These three things could easily be fixed by two really simple fixes: Reveal the objectives after the mission is done and think through the objectives some more. Revealing the objectives after the mission may sound bad, and it wouldn't discourage creativity for that first time.

The games have also lately been dumbed down looking at how little stealth is encouraged in the later titles. Looking at AC:I, the games seem to care less and less about the actual creed of the assassins. In AC:I, the tenets of the creed is heavily enforced on the player, they become aware of the ways of the assassins and gets an understanding what the assassins are all about. In AC:III, the tenets are not even referenced to. I understand this is partially because the brotherhood has evolved, and while that is interesting, one of the reasons why I fell in love with the series is because the assassins really had an ideal and creed. They don't kill for no reason

So in order to encourage creativity

The player is first introduced to the idea of the assassins creed and the three tenets (stay your flesh from the blade of an innocent, just like the sync system does. Unlike the sync system, you will not be given any information on how to best kill your target or how to get a better result, it's expected of you ass an assassin to know these tenets (the game will explain how you will achieve a better result, all missions play by those rules). The game will keep track of all you do instead of giving you secondary objectives, and therefor you must be creative to get a better result.

This is how the game would see how well you follow the tenets:

* ""Stay Your Blade from the Flesh of an Innocent""
This tenet discourage the killing of those who doesn't have to die. From what I understand, the assassin should try to only kill the target. In other words, the player will score a higher result if they sneak past the guards rather than killing everyone. Not killing civilians is obviously a requirement.

* ""Hide in Plain Sight""
(from the wikia:)Be unseen. The Assassins' aim was to get close to their target stealthily, awe-inspiring assassinations, usually in public.
The greatest illusion from such an assassination was that the Assassin seemingly materialized from nowhere

This part is easy to translate into this system: don't get caught. The less the guards see you

* ""Never Compromise the Brotherhood""
The actions of one must never bring harm to all. If an Assassin failed in his or her duty, or bring harm to any member of it.

By just following this description, I believe this could be translated into ""kill all those (guards) who have noticed you, do not let them tell their officers about you, because that will be a risk for the brotherhood. In other words, if a guard discovers you, kill him, and do not let him alarm others.

(Ubisoft could easily add other factors

Now, or you can go the path with less guards but a less ""good"" possibility for an assassination. Perhaps your weakness is to sneak past the guards and therefor kill them, but can make up for it by killing them stealthily and making a great assassination of your target. Another player may be the exact opposite. Perhaps you find a path that no other player have thought of, and will therefor get a greater result.

TL;DR: Make the full sync objectives hidden until you complete a mission

The main game will be 15 – 20 hours

“Edward’s four flintlocks actually reload faster than Connor’s… It’s that way so you don’t have to wait around forever.”

“[Assassin's Creed] is about credibility and authenticity

Answering the question of who replaces Desmond, you replace Desmond. Playing in first-person.

Black Flag will have some “Assassin tombs like in [Assassin's Creed 2].”

“We’ve listened to our fans and brought back several elements from #AC2 and #ACB

“You can stealth your way through about 85% of the game

Ashraf’s favorite part of making the game was “pushing seamless gameplay, I’ll say Altaïr.”

“All of the sword takedowns will be unique (Hidden Blade too!).”

“Yes

The most significant differences in Black Flag are “naval combat and exploration gameplay.”

The present day storyline picks up right after Assassin’s Creed III

“No double barrel pistols… maybe next time.  ”

When asked if we could crouch, but when you come out of the foliage you can remain crouched.”

“There isn’t currently a plan to do a game with Ezio’s daughter.”

“There is no character customization in the present day

“The world is bigger [than Assassin's Creed III] and there are tons of cohesive side activities and side missions… more than any previous AC. All of the side mission/activities have something that they give you

“Within the first 4 hours of the game

“Yes

Plantations reset do reset so you can raid them again and “forts have side missions connected to them and become friendly

“We have new factions that should be familiar to AC fans

It turns out that you can take it pretty far.

If you're using trip mines to target civilians

If there are guards caught in the blast, it seems you can harvest with impunity.

So far

* Start riot near guards (preferably just one or two)

* Watch guards and rioters clash

* Throw money at guards

* Plant mine at guards' feet

* Sweet

The game is to see how many civilian bodies you can have on screen at once without desyncronizing.  So far

1368561455.0,1ec2sb,"To all the people who say they want to go back to AC1’s stealthy-assassin roots, I would like this to be a definitive rant on why you are wrong and you should please stop now.",Spelcheque,277,135,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1ec2sb/to_all_the_people_who_say_they_want_to_go_back_to/, but apparently a lot of you didn’t bother to use them. Creeping through bushes

2) AC1 was not a stealth game. From the very beginning they decided to focus on three mechanics: stealth, and a lot of the in-game dialogue. The difference between that and the game we actually played is called [ludonarrative dissonance.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludonarrative) If you think AC1 is a stealth game because you “work in the shadows to serve the light,” then you suffer from this.

3) Assassin is not synonymous with stealth. Via [Mirriam-Webster:](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/assassin) “1: a member of a Shia Muslim sect who at the time of the Crusades was sent out on a suicidal mission to murder prominent enemies. 2: a person who commits murder; especially : one who murders a politically important person either for hire or from fanatical motives” As for the first definition, the game-world’s secret society dedicated to promoting the freedom of the common man, often through violence. That also applies to all three protagonists. The idea of an assassin as someone who sneaks around stabbing people comes, as far as I can tell, from Dungeons and Dragons. Grow the fuck up.

4) The games are based on history. [These are assassins from history.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assassins) Note how few of them were full-time sneaky stabbers. They were men of their times who at some point decided to change history through murder. A successful assassin isn’t necessarily the one who’s good at hiding in shadows. Sometimes it’s the one who works his way up the social ladder through business

I’m not completely close-minded. If you think I’m wrong you can try to convince me

One reason I would very much like for you to stop is because Ubisoft

If you want to play a stealth game, please, just shut the fuck up.

I probably won’t want to type this whole argument again

Edit:  Some have said that there is no stealth in the main missions.  I would like to point out that The Surgeon, Execution is Everything, The Braddock Expedition, Boston's Most Wanted, On Johnson's Trail, Hostile Negotiations, The Midnight Ride, Battle of Bunker Hill, Lee's Last Stand and Laid to Rest all feature stealth as either a requirement or an encouraged option.  

Edit 2:  People have been saying that making the combat easier diminishes the stealth in the game.  I strongly disagree.  Making combat harder wouldn't make the stealth better,,False,,t5_2s6v6,1368635299.0,,True

You also learn that they think you're a member of the Assassin Brotherhood (you used to be
* the reason they kidnapped you, came into possession of an artifact called The Apple, which is one of many Pieces Of Eden. So without so much as a how-do-you-do, they (Warren and his assistant Lucy Stillman), place you in the machine.  
* when the Animus starts up, but arrive just in time to see Robert de Sable, the Templar Grandmaster, get to it first. Because he's such a massive douche who stole your prize, Altair tries to stab him in the face, but fails. Shit hits the fan, and your buddies get caught behind as you're forced to flee the collapsing temple.  
* you return to the Assassin's castle stronghold at Masyaf (real place, rocks up minus a functioning arm with the Apple, with a Templar force right behind him. You do some sneaky bastard stuff, and sneak around them and overpower them.  
* after they've fucked off, thinks you dun goofed, so he demotes you by **stabbing you in the neck**. Okay... aaanyway, somehow you survive, and are told you're going to have to earn you way back up to the top rank.  
* you are the provided with names of people who require murdering because they're being complete and utter bastards. You ride to three different cities; Jerusalem, whether it be a weapons dealer, a lord, a military commander, or just some fat cunt with a squeaky voice. You gather info on your targets, and assassinate them one by one over the duration of the game. Every kill restores a level of rank (also, each target is based on an actual historical figure that died in 1191). As you notch up a bodycount, in their dying moments, because the NWO requires the sacrifice of free will
* he discovers that de Sable has been planning something nefarious: to unite the Christian and Muslim armies together against the Assassins. Fuck. He chases down Robert and catches up to him in front of Richard the Lionheart (who is one *fat* motherfucker). Dick says a trial by combat should take place, he did it all himself (I wonder if he made a faces of atheism post about that. ""I heard people praise God when I smote that bastard Robert de Sable. I DIDN'T SPEND MY WHOLE LIFE TRAINING FOR AN INVISIBLE SKY WIZARD TO GET THE CREDIT""). He then tries to convince King Dick that ending the war would be beneficial to both parties (Dick says no). Before he's proper dead, de Sable tells Altair that Al Mualim is actually a Templar too. What. A. Cunt.  
* you go back to Masyaf to do your own version of Star Wars (Dirt Wars?) and confront bossman. He tells you The Apple can conjure illusions, you crazy fool"", then Al Pooalim shows him some magic tricks, creating clones of himself. You then have a throwdown, and win. You recover the Apple from his body, and it turns on, showing a globe of the world with locations marked all over the place.  
* with the memory complete, tells you she's an assassin working undercover, and she's going to help you soon. When she leaves, you experience something weird: Eagle Vision. Walking around, you see symbols all over the floor and walls that you can't see normally. It turns out the previous person to do this shit, 'Subject 16', was in the Animus for so long he ended up crazier than a shithouse rat, credits roll",t5_2s6v6,True

AC1 through ACR all dealt with, and what obligations come with that realisation.  For an action videogame, that was some *deep shit*.

AC3, Connor himself is absolutely not interested in participating in that cause and he makes that abundantly clear very often.

Connor's motivation is not the Creed or some sense of moral obligation towards individual liberty

Altair:
Stealth. When I say stealth, which realistically would be ideal for stealth. I believe this is due to his background of being born into the creed, being taught at a young age to use stealth.

Ezio:
Open combat. Although he uses stealth, open combat would be more suitable for him. He is also more well equipped for open combat, with his armor and his large variety of equipment. His flashy personality is the biggest factor in fighting style, not his background (Italian noble thrown into the creed due to an event), if it were to affect his fighting style, it would make him more aggressive, but that is later resolved.

Connor:
Guerrilla. The basis of this style is using your environment

Desmond too, and he doesn't need a moral victory. He needs results, and the best chance is by letting everyone live and fight against the tyranny. He could have chosen to make a stand on principle, but that wouldn't stop the death of all the people he knows he can save.

1365976537.0,1cckw8,Assassin's Creed Custom Hoodie,mercury24,156,25,59,"Hello all

My girlfriend has made a few hoodies for me and my friends and is currently making a new one for me to update her design. She would like to know if any of you would be interested in having one made and if so what exactly you would be interested in. She currently has white and black material for the outside shell and red for the inside. She is putting a beak on the hood but could leave it off. She is also unsure of what to charge when she finalizes a design. Would these options be enough? Would you want something else?


She has offered to make the first 5 or so at cost plus shipping so she can fine tune the design (I think it is quite perfect as is but she is a perfectionist) and in light of AC:IV coming soon I figured I would see if any of you would be interested in being guinea pigs or in setting up some kind of order as well. 


Any input is welcome as well as all constructive criticism.


Here are some pics of the last one she made for a friend of mine and once she finishes with my new black one I can post pics. All hoodies have been made to fit the wearer. 


http://imgur.com/a/RvOlB


**::UPDATE::**


Ok I wasn't expecting this kind of response so soon. She thinks she currently has enough fabric stock to make 1 black and 3 whites. She will have to order more fabric if you guys like the finished product so she can actually start doing this for people. She estimates her cost to be 50 plus shipping and once she starts going she thinks her final product might be worth 75 plus shipping. We are in the US and can ship however you would like. 


If you guys are still interested hit me with a PM and I will take first come first serve. Send me color, tweaks (If possible), and any other stuff. 


She is very excited about the response this got and loves you all even if you don't want to buy!


**::UPDATE::**


Black was taken. Sorry that went so quick but she will be able to order more fabric if demanded.


**::UPDATE::**


I am sorry to say she may be out of fabric. I will still be capable of taking any requests for back orders but I think our first batch may be through. She is super excited that you all have taken an interest and I thank you for the kind words. If I get her to set up an etsy or something I will make sure to post that as well!


**::UPDATE::** (I got some formatting!)


OK so I have been bypassed because she wants to be able to get you all a hoodie! I hate you all ;)


So


She started the first black hoodie today and is going to have to make the pattern for it cause she didnt have one for a smaller size (I'm kind of a monster) but once she does she will be able to have a better understanding of how quickly she can pop these out and we might be able to start taking regular orders. I will post pictures of the black one AS SOON as she gets it finished. She didn't think black would be such a hit but it seems black is the new black. I will keep you posted as things roll in!

   Do the homestead missions. They make your crafting better

   Get the assassin recruits. They are a LOT more useful than they were in previous games. They can escort you as their fake prisoner or just run around with you in a badass assassin pack until you get into trouble.

   If you're trying to do the boston brawler missions

The second tip involves the ""go beat people up"" missions. The brewery doesn't appear on the map. [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG0IqI0FwAI) video shows you where it is.

   If you're trying to do the frontier hunting missions and can't find a hunting cabin

   I'm having trouble finding George Washington to have conversations with him. Does anybody know where he is? I've beaten the game already.

   I bought the map to all the chests

Now before all of you start chasing after me with pitchforks, and enjoyed all of them, even the first one, which is widely regarded as not very good.

In the first Assassin's Creed, and then having to regain them back, along with a new sense of identity, culminating with the reveal of Desmond in the real world, and then at the end the betrayal of his mentor, the introduction of the Apple, and the fact that Desmond can use Eagle Vision. We build a relationship with Altair

Then the revolutionary Assassin's Creed II comes out. This game blew me away. It was leaps and bounds better than the first. But what really captured the player was the relationship that was built with Ezio. We literally started out as a child, the panning out of the camera, and the Assassin's Creed logo, I knew it was the start of something great. And it most certainly was. Every relationship you built in the game mattered. You as the player were connected with each and every character, mostly Ezio. You wanted to overcome the Templar plot, find out exactly what they were up to. You learned as Desmond and Ezio learned. The puzzles that were added were ingenious, uncovering the truth about the past piece by piece, but as the player. Then once you did all that

The same goes for Brother and Revelations. We are now master assassin's. We can control and train new assassin's. We are spreading the cause, and our part within it. Still, each relationship built felt so meaningful, that you just WANTED to progress. You needed to know what was going to happen next.

Enter Assassin's Creed 3. I can't say the same about this series. The whole process felt very streamlined, but I felt no connection to any of the characters, nor Connor at all. Ezio wanted to further the Assassin cause, overcome the Templars. Connor felt like he was blindly marching in and just wanted to save his people. Understandable, but still, unrelatable as a whole with the rest of the series. I didn't feel like an Assassin; I felt like an angsty boy who wanted vengeance. He seemed just like a conduit to find the amulet, and even then

It seems like Ubisoft got lazy with this game, special weapons, basically things you had to work for to feel more like an awesome assassin), and streamlined the entire process. Where's the relationships? Why did I not really care that George Washington betrayed me? Shouldn't I have felt more conflicted when I killed my father? Why didn't I feel any satisfaction after finally killing Charles Lee? Why wasn't I shocked and awed when I found out that Juno wanted to betray us? Because it was all just thrown at me. There was no substance behind it. No involvement. 

This series has been an amazing journey. I don't want to see it fall like other game series have. I want to see it go back to its roots

Edit: This discussion got a little bit of attention, and don't want to see, because I am still a huge fan of the series. There are many things to love about the game, and I appreciate them all. Also, I will be returning to the game to do those side missions I missed in my first playthrough. Perhaps I will find more depth to the story, and the relatability to Connor and a connection with the characters that I crave through there. Thank you all for reading.",,,,

Forgive me if this was already obvious to everyone else, in which Desmond allows the world to be destroyed only to start it over with him at the helm, symbolizes the Templars. This is because the Templars main idea was control of the masses by a selected few; if Desmond had chosen this option, he would have become a deity (as Minerva said) and therefore been worshipped, making him the one truly in control of the people. The Assassins main idea was peace through freedom, which relies on absolute trust in the people to conduct the world. In short, the Assassins trust the power of the individual, Desmond chooses the way of the Assassins,,
1353551390.0,13lmor,"AC3, a theory on the first target [Spoiler, Sequence 11]",ShouldersofGiants100,132,41, stop reading, Haytham was raised and unknowingly trained
1. He is either an assassin (given his age, given the way the assassins pursue Haytham's ship on the way to America and the fact he is forced to kill the man rather than simply steal the key, a legitimate option with a non-assassin)
2. He personally knows Haytham
3. Haytham says he is sorry before killing the man and the man says sorry back
4. The man says that had Haytham come to him
I think the evidence from this leads to only one conclusion

First consider the apparent age of the man, look more carefully at the actual dialogue in the scene (http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=h98nNWeLycM#t=791s). The man seems surprised that Haytham is there, but the way in which he greets him is not with the same derision we have seen when assassins meet templars unexpectedly in the other games. He then says that they could have found another way, had Haytham come to him. William Miles mentions in a dialogue that there have been moments where assassins and templars have tried to reconcile, this could be the aftermath of one of them. Haytham has moved on, but his father refuses to accept it and yearns to reconcile, which is why he makes no move against Haytham, but the target says that he is sorry to. While ""I'm also sorry you are going to kill me"" is a possible interpretation

Haytham: For what it's worth
Target: As am I

From that perspective, but he remembered little of it. While saying it, he seems almost nostalgic. It is also revealed that this is a revival of the play. The scenario is almost poetic. An irreconcilably distant father and son both attend a performance of a play that could well be their last real memory together. Haytham was converted to the templars rather young, it doesn't seem a stretch that his father taking him to the play could have occurred shortly before his perspective changed, creating a distance between the two and ensuring no more close memories.

* first thing you see is a cutscene of Ezio travelling to Masyaf to learn more about Altair. It's one of the best cutscenes I've ever seen. There's a fucking epic battle, but considering he's Ezio Fucking Auditore, he escapes and chases the bad guys down.  
* you find yourself at the door to Altair's Library, really ugly) guy with the book, and stab him in the chest. You call him a bastard, take the book, and it's off to Constantinople!  
* considering Ezio is now Il Mentore of the Assassin Brotherhood (*the* boss), meets up with you, gives the lowdown on what's happening in Constantinople (the Byzantines are pissed off with the Ottomans for beating them up and taking over the city), and then gives you your brand new Hookblade. You run around and 'learn' how to use it (read: have fucktons of fun with your new toy), then you get down to business.  
* the story actually has several main paths
* **STORY ONE**    
   Upon arriving in Constantinople, you learn it's now a bookshop run by the awesome-boobed Sofia Sartor. She helps you decipher messages in rare books that you find, and each time, you are able to locate a key. Over the game, you can see a blossoming romance developing.   
* **STORY TWO**   
   another person you meet claims to be a young student at first, it's staying), with daddy being a better choice. Sully tells you that he thinks Tarik, the captain of the guard, is working with Templars to control who takes the Sultanate (that one *is* a real word). He asks you to investigate.  
* you find out Tarik has been helping some fat cunt called Manuel bring in weapons to supply an army to overthrow the Turks and bring back the Byzantines. With Sully's request, and he's holed up in some underground city. Off you go...  
* you sail to Cappadocia after destroying the Great Chain, blow shit up, and murder the fat fuck. At this point, you learn that Ahmet is a Templar, and he's got your girlfriend!!!    
* **STORY CONVERGENCE**  
   you get back to Constantinople, fucks you over, but you're able to save Sofia's ~~boobs~~ life. You give chase to get the keys back. You catch up, youse both fall over the cliff, and you *beat him up in mid-air* (seriously, it's fucking awesome). Selim shows up after being recently Sultanified, kills Ahmet
* Ezio and Sofia both travel to Masyaf to finally open Altair's Library. 

--- 

* **THE KEYS**  
   each time you find a key
   * 2 years before the events of AC1
   * right after killing Al Mualim at the end of AC1, some douche who hates your guts, steals the Apple and tries to show everybody why he's tougher than Altair. Altair saves him after he almost dies. Dumbarse.   
   * Altair and his wife Maria have returned after 10 years of telling Genghis Khan to stop being a bully, one of his cronies taunted Altair about killing his son, so he tried to use the Apple to make him cut his own throat. For some stupid reason, Maria tries to stop you, and gets stabbed by the guy she's trying to save. You murder him to death, by way of *bladus meetus neckus*, then escape after everyone tries to kill you.  
   * after 20 years in exile, and kill him with the hidden gun that was learnt through the Apple. Altair takes his place as Il Mentore.  
   * the fifth key shows Altair passing the keys onto Niccolo Polo
* **BACK TO EZIO**  
   after opening the door to the Library, you see that it's Altair. Ezio leans down to pay his respects, and see another key sitting in his lap. He takes it and activates it.  
   * the memory is of Altair standing at the door to library as a 92 year old man, then sits in the chair for ""a little rest"", then the camera shows Ezio kneeling in front of his remains.  
* **HERE'S WHERE IT GETS *REALLY* FUCKING EPIC**  
   Ezio decides to leave the Apple, but I know you're watching"". He says he has lived a life of purpose, but was nothing more than a conduit for another, and that he hopes Desmond finds the answers he was looking for. He then holds his arms out to signify an embrace (you see an image of Desmond returning the courtesy. It's way cool).  
* then a cutscene of Jupiter, and that there is one final vault that has the answer, and he shows him the location. The whole time he was talking another amazing cutscene of the annihilation plays out. Desmond wakes up from his coma to find he has been taken to America. His arm glows blue, he sees the Apple they'd taken from AC:B, and he says ""I know what we have to do"". Credits roll.

**""This installment doesn't fit in the series, how did that come to pass when in literally every game we've played the assassins kick the crap out of the templars at the end, and reform their order in full strength? I think characters like Connor explain it, more assassins who really don't put the order, or the greater good before their own selfish goals. It's not that Connor doesn't fit the mold of an assassin, it's that over time what it meant to be an assassin changed, which explains a lot about Desmond's world and situation, which is a much more unified thing. Anyway lets face it

**""The buildings weren't as tall as in the old games:""** Well, the smaller buildings made escaping guards more challenging. 

**""Not enough cities:""** I really would have like to see more places as well, but I never felt like what they had was not enough. There is so ridiculously much to do in this game.

**""Slow pace:** I actually liked this. One of the problems I had with the old AC games is that I thought, I think he was one of the better developed. 

**""Desmond's death was not dramatic enough""**I don't think this was an accident at all. One of the major messages in the game is that no one individual really matters that much. I think most of the game was setting us up for Desmond's end to be kind of anticlimactic. That's pretty much what Charles Lee's whole speech was about at the funeral: That yea, and Connor will kill Lee, and someone else will step up and get killed in an endless cycle etc... Desmond's death is not the end of the story (well obviously, since they're making another game), if it were too dramatic it wouldn't have fit with that message.

On that note, that Desmond gets ambushed and when asked something like how did the attacker know he was there, he says ""ask your father."" I don't think they ever really explain that. The Haytham/Connor relationship is also obviously suppose to mirror the William/Desmond relationship, which might be some kind of clue as well. 
Is it possible that William is somehow involved with Abstergo? It seems like Desmond's ultimate choice to help Juno over Minerva is ultimately the Templar answer, and William was there to make sure all went as planned? I don't know, it would be an interesting possibility, and would also explain why there was no touching father/son moment before Desmond died. It would also explain how Abstergo captured him apparently, but when he was tied up there was not a bruise on him as though there were no fight.

This movie turned out longer than I expected. I believe this game is actually the shortest Assassin's Creed game

I make these movies based on games for a few reasons. One is so that I can show these stories to people who don't play video games at all. This way they can enjoy the story without having to learn how to play. I also create these movies for people who may have been interested in the story, to be able to relive the entire story in a single sitting is an experience rare to games. 

The way I do this is I focus on cutscenes primarily. The cutscenes are the primary drivers of the story, so to get the whole story you have to include some gameplay. However, because there is a big difference between video games and movies, I want to include as little of gameplay as I'm able to do without causing plot holes, and while keeping a good pacing/continuity. I also disable as many aspects of the game that show it off as a game, such as the hud, any button prompts, etc. It's not possible to remove all of these entirely

I will continue doing these and will be doing Assassin's Creed 3 next

The rope dart has a few counter actions that are pretty cool. But what really surprised me was the animal snare. Just attach it as your primary tool and counter with it

AC3 is its own game, and has his own story. I'm sorry if this seems repetitive, but a large portion of the people in this subreddit expects multiple aspects of the AC3 game to be like the previous installments of the AC Series. 

I know that Ezio had a lovable personality

Also, Achilles, and the other few recruits. I must remind everyone that the Creed's influence had diminished when we were introduced to Connor which was a realistic portrayal of change throughout the centuries. The customs and traditions of the Creed were long forgotten by the time of the Revolutionary War which disappointed many people, but I don't understand how many berate AC3 when this was also apparent during the Desmond parts of the game. 
 
The change had to come from somewhere

As for the gameplay, the tree-climbing, hunting, crafting, differentiated side quests, and the underground tunnels. Some details may not have been as emphasized or admired as others, but it gave AC3 a new twist from what we were used to as well as gave the game its own flair and flavor.

Let's appreciate AC3 for what it is: An awesome video game of its own. Accompanied by an awesome story

It's no doubt they are still missed

Edit to add link: http://kotaku.com/ubisoft-has-three-assassins-creeds-in-development-vow-513376223

&gt;Ubisoft is committed to making a new Assassin's Creed game every year and is determined not to see the series collapse from franchise fatigue. How?

&gt;""We are making sure the teams who are creating the different iterations have enough time—two years,"" Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot told me this week during E3.

&gt;He said Ubisoft currently has three Assassin's Creed games in development. He didn't say anything about them, 2) next year's game (Assassin's Creed V? Assassin's Creed Brotherhood II?), which should be well into development now and, 3) unless he was referring to a mobile spin-off or something, 2015's Assassin's Creed.

&gt;""Really, for me, the formula: if you can really change the game on a regular basis and bring in innovation your fans want a product very regularly. Our job is to make sure the teams have enough power, enough energy and enough time to take the necessary steps to create a high quality game.""

&gt;Historically, while satellite studios make everything from multiplayer to specific side missions.

&gt;Ubisoft is releasing Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag this year which does, conflicted half-British/half-Native-American assassin. This year's is set largely across the islands of the Caribbean sea with a focus on a new assassin who still often behaves more like a pirate. Last year's game had some naval combat. This year's game is essentially an open-world sailing/exploration adventure.

&gt;ACIII may have had its flaws and it's impossible to say how good ACIV will be, yes, somehow, Ubisoft really is able to make a gargantuan new AC every year. Pretty impressive.",,False,,False,t3_1ie6gz
1370418876.0,1fpk0d,Story synopsis - Assassin's Creed 3,UnholyDemigod,137,27,51,"Now, I'm going to tell them separate from each other to alleviate confusion. First up

* The group arrives at a cave. The Grand Temple, looking at all the cool stuff, and come to a hyoooge barrier made of some green light that they can't cross without some kind of key. With no idea of what to do next, Desmond decides it would be super-polite to get visions and pass out, so they throw him in the animus to fix him (and to, y'know, learn some handy shit)

**THE PAST**

* after the new animus program is synched, and you're at a play at some fancy opera house. You park your arse in a seat, get bored and decide to do some killin'. You use the most outstanding manners ever to move to the side, climb up and around and have a chat with some old geezer. Then you stab him and steal his necklace, some fancy green circle amulet

* you have a meeting with some other Assassins about moving to the New World (hereafter known as 'America') and finding the 'Precursor Site'. You get the go ahead

* after a few weeks, Charles Lee. He's a potential recruit into the Brotherhood, so he currently serves as your stooge. You meet up with your fellow assassins, those being Thomas Hickey, an alcoholic, William Johnson, a pompous git, and Benjamin Church, and free some Indian slaves

* your next mission has you chasing down one of the Indian ladies that you freed, she tells you she needs your help. After being totally awesome gets you into a fight, you hunt down some fella called Braddock and kill him

* Ziio takes you to the Precursor Site (her tribe looks after it)

* you meet up with all your buddies after you're done, so you formally initiate him into the Templar Order

 Wait

 What

 Wait

 [What. The. Fuck.]( http://replygif.net/i/744.gif)

 As is turns out

* a cutscene shows Ziio explaining how Haytham knocked her up with Connor and then fucked off

* you finally get to experience the memories of Connor as a boy (he's got some weird indian name I don't know how to spell so I'll just call him Connor), then lets you go, and you return to find your village burning, and watch as your mum dies

* after a nine year jump

* you go meet the tribe's witch-doctor, and Juno appears, telling you she's taking you to the Nexus, some magical place where you become an eagle and fly around while she tells you to look for the guy with the Assassin symbol

* you pack your bags and make your way to the homestead, cos fuck him and fuck his privacy

* you see some bad guys trying to break in

* after your training

 Benjamin Franklin

 Samual Adams

 Paul Revere

 ~~Palestine~~ Israel Putnam

* when your training is finished

* a few years later, severely horrifying poms everywhere. You find Bill John and kill him

* after a bit more running and riding, after that, you see Georgie become El Presidente

* you track down and kill Pitcairn, and exchange one of my favourite quotes ever:
 
 Pitcairn: ""you should have let me play my part""

 Connor: ""the part of the puppeteer""

 Pitcairn: ""better we hold the strings than another""

 Connor: ""no. The strings should be severed. **All** should be free""

* you go after Hickey next, only Charles Lee gets Hickey out and frames you for the attempted assassination of Washington, and has you sentenced to hang

* your fellow Assassins manage to save you from the noose just in time

* your next target is Church

* back at Washington's tent, and he's done it again. Connor tells the both of them to get fucked, and runs off to save his mates

* it turns out your village has allied with Lee

* you need to break into Fort George because Lee is hiding there

* you manage to get inside, he sits on top on you and starts to strangle you, and being a complete dumbarse, forgets what Assassins are famous for: their hidden blades. You stab him in the neck and he dies

* still wounded, but are caught by his guards. Lee leaves you with them and you manage to escape

* you find Lee at the boatyard, but get trapped under falling debris. Just as Chuck's about to kill you, you pull out your gun and shoot him, but he manages to survive and get away. Again

* you follow him to a pub and watch one of the most powerful cutscenes ever:two men who hold absolute hatred for the other, and so offers Connor a drink. Connor accepts, and rather than taunting Lee or drawing out his death, ends his life quickly, taking the amulet

* after visiting his village and using the Apple to talk to Juno again

**THE PRESENT**

* Desmond is told the Temple runs on some kind of ancient power source, so you climb a skyscraper, jump off and land on another, meet Daniel Cross, beat him up and take the battery

* the next is at an MMA fight in Brazil

* Dad gets captured by Abstergo, marches into Vidic's office, then uses the Apple to make one of his guards shoot him in his fat fucken face, which made me laugh. IT'S A WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION YOU STUPID BASTARD

* you all go dig up Achilles, Juno appears to tell you about their attempts to stop their destruction, some being:

 * they tried to absorb the sun's rays


 * they looked to the future to give a warning to us by talking to Ezio

 * one fella volunteered for hibernation

* with the place running at full power, because it will free Juno and she will conquer the world

* Desmond is made to choose between letting Juno free, then a prophet, then a god, and people will kill over his memory and misrepresented words (so basically, Religion 101). If he touches it, he will die. He touches it and dies, and a cutscene shows a news report of geological anomalies, and steps over Desmond's corpse as the credits roll.

Desmond Miles. Subject 17. The ending wasnt satisfying but the missions in new york were fun to play and see Desmond back in action. 

Now onto the bad.
Yes it took forever to get the Assassin Outfit they should have at least made it one mission as his dad not like 6-8.
Yes there glitches but none that get in the way. 

Connor. He didnt have much feeling unless you noticed it he had smirks and sarcasm which made me feel like he was on a mission and he couldnt get distracted as much as he knew he could. He has see his mom dye before his eyes. And people want connor to have more emotion? That scarred him for life. He will not be able to have much happiness until he feels closure.

Overall

The press embargo JUST got dropped

Last week I got to fly down to Boston to play Assassins Creed 3 along with Assassins Creed: Liberation with a bunch of other major community members and (what felt like) pretty much every video gaming journalist ever.

I got to play about three hours of Multiplayer AC3

For multiplayer, Wolf Pack and Manhunt. I won't go into the multiplayer storyline, as I saw WAY to much of it (Everything in multiplayer was unlocked at the event, so I saw....a little too much...).

Platforms I played multiplayer on:

* Wolfpack and Manhunt on 360
* Domination and Playground on PS3

No WiiU's or PC's were at the event.

In single player I got to play sequence three. I won't go into storyline related details as I don't want to ruin it for you guys. However

I got to play a later sequence in Liberation (I think it was 5 or 6).  Again

I didn't get any gameplay footage. Why? Because IGN and G4 were there playing the same thing. I don't really think it would be too cool watching shitty iphone footage of the game.

Some pictures for proof. Again

1351436015.0,127xla,My spoiler free review of the game so far,kikkaman,121,16,95,"A local store near me leaked it early and I've been playing much of the day. I know there's an AMA but this is more of some things I enjoyed o far. I would probably say I am in the middle in terms of story.

The pros

Combat
It is much more fun this time around. Having played the other ones, two bears were waiting to wipe them out. Combos are so much more smoother as well.

Hunting
I cannot describe how much fun they made this. Think Red Dead but more detailed. There are tracks you follow, I lose it's hide. However, if I stalk it and stab its neck, I reap the full benefits. They reward you with better loot if you kill animals a harder method. It is also easy to see which animals are in the location. Once you find the animal, your map will note that this certain animal roams the area. Ive maybe encountered nine different animals so far.

Naval
Probably the greatest part so far. You don't just command a ship.... You command a crew. The free roam aspect is great. You truely get the experience of a captain. You can upgrade your ship with better cannons

Story
It's important to note I never cared about the story. I never really paid attention to the previous ones and played it mostly for gameplay. This one is different. I have yet to skip a movie since I've become addicted to it. I understand almost everything that is going on but I'll probably have a better understanding if I read some summaries. This story

Difficulty
It is harder this time around but your health regenerates. No more potions. So once you finish a battle

Cons

Some minor bugs here and there. This usually caused me to miss an optional task for full synchronization. 

The graphics are great but some cinematics can show signs of weakness. I don't really know how to explain it. You can tell its a bit dull. Some glitches I guess. I'm sure will be patched.

Overall
I couldn't be more happier with my purchase. Ubisoft has gone above and beyond with this one and have excelled in every possible way from their previous games. Anyone getting it will surely be in awe as they play. I'll answer any questions as well so I hope you guys enjoyed my review. Sorry for the typos,False,,t5_2s6v6,False,,,t3_127xla

1370185364.0,1firl1,I think I've discovered a way to make a legitimate hidden blade...,UnholyDemigod,127,25,48,"Now first of all, or even knowing if it will actually work

Any time you see someone with a purchased or homemade hidden blade, kinda like those collapsible plastic swords. This design works the sake way they do in the game: they shoot out, and they shoot back in with a simple wrist movement. In theory anyway. Lets begin! (Excuse the shitty drawings; they're not to scale)

There's 3 different viewpoints I've done in the drawings; there's top view

[This image](http://i.imgur.com/RxuvQcZ.jpg) is for side view A. It shows the panel covering the 'blade box'. That white line is a slit

[This one](http://i.imgur.com/AnKDBRW.jpg) is both the top view, only this time the covering has been removed to show the internal mechanisms. The two 'columns' to the side are both hollow, and have a spring at the top and bottom of each side. There's a narrow slit going down each side which will be on the side of the blade compartment, which the blade base will fit into. The circle in the middle is a hole, which a peg will be inserted and kept in place by spring, which when pulled out, will remove the peg from hole (and the hole in the blade) and allow the internal springs to do their work. 

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/Kal3bcu.jpg) we have the blade, ready for use. Note both the peg and hole on/in the blade. The wide flat base of the blade is important; it sits on top of the springs, which when the peg is released, will both force the blade up, and down again upon re-release. 

[Image of the blade being extended](http://i.imgur.com/dDmI5v1.jpg). Whereas in the sheathed picture the bottom springs were tight, and the bottom springs are loose. 

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/VS3P7uX.jpg) is side view B (zoomed out). The little box thing would be up against your wrist (note that the entire thing will be inside another compartment and strapped to a bracer

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/42pUEeJ.jpg) is the same image zoomed in to get a better look at the mechanisms. The little box holds two springs, when depressed the are ready to force the peg back into its hole. The line coming out is a piece of string attached to the base of the peg, that leads out of the box, around a roller-type thing, up towards your hand and is attached to a ring. 

---

Now, which in turn pulls the peg out of the hole (once it's out relax your hand). Now that the peg is out of the hole, the blade is able to move freely up and down. Because the bottom springs were depressed, they force the blade upwards, and the force will depress the top springs into a tight position, allowing the blade too be up to the point where the bottom has moved past the peg-hole, allowing the peg to slot the hole (because the springs are trying to force it back into place), repeat the process. Flick your hand to pull the sting, locking it in the sheathed position

As I said before, or just retarded. If someone were to make this, and it turns out the way I envisioned, this could potentially be an extremely dangerous *concealed* weapon, so I shouldn't need to tell you that it will be extremely illegal. So don't try this shit at home kids. ",,False,t5_2s6v6,True

1370278481.0,1fl9aq,What I really want to see in ACIV,SchnitzelSandwich,117,15,43,"**HOMESTEAD/VILLA***

What I loved about AC2 and AC3, except that instead of doing missions to improve your little city/town, you could buy buildings and invest in them like AC2, and do missions to improve them, such as getting better tools to the blacksmith, so you could buy more weapons, or get a discount.

**BETTER ECONOMY**

In AC3, I really didn't use the cash. I would like to see multiple stores brought back, like AC2 where there was a blacksmith where you could get weapons and armor, or a tailor where you could dye your clothes. It was very diverse, and it kept things fresh.

**ARMOR BEING BROUGHT BACK**

I really liked the armor mechanic in the previous games, where he could buy leather pieces for himself. In the trailers, Edward has some leather on himself. Maybe we can even do a lightweight but durable metal, (not the titanium suit that Ezio had) but I'm not sure that pirates exactly wore metal armor back then. It can possibly something like this: http://gamentrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/946114_449133195179476_624953545_n.jpg I also want ship armor that you could buy from the blacksmith, along with the Edward's regular armor.


**ASSASSIN TOMBS**

I think that we can all agree that having Assassin Tombs back would be great. They are fun and enjoyable, but no such thing exists yet in the AC universe, but not too OP) or the Sword of Eden. I always wanted something like the Sword or the Armor of Eden in a AC game.

That about warps it up. Please feel free to share your opinion with.
Thanks!



EDIT



**CRAFTING SYSTEM**

One more thing I would like to mention, because it's only useful purpose in the game was crafting the special weapons, and selling bear skins to make quick and easy cash. Plus, most of the good stuff, such as the pistols and swords you can craft, were not really available until the near end of the game. Ubisoft, if you are reading this thread, or remove it all together and instead have an AC2 type of economy (which was also incredibly enjoyable) improved and refined.
Please let me know of what you think of this. I would love to hear your opinion. Thanks!

Speaking of bombs, I just purchased them fully made from a dealer.
I didn't experience a single tower defence game throughout the story, as upon finding out what the missions were...I didn't bother.

I've got tons of challenges to do, only have 2 master assassins, bought about 4 weapons (not even experienced the crossbow yet), bought one landmark and only renovated half the shops.  
I'm expecting Brotherhood to be delivered tommorrow (I know

So yeah, a few things that I did not.  If I restarted I could see myself spending 75% of my time making money, doing challenges and restoring shops and only 25% of the time doing the actual story.  Obviously if I did I would go for full sync as I didn't get full sync on all missions.

My grandfather told me this last night during Thanksgiving and blew me away because he has no idea I'm a fan of Assassins Creed. While he was telling me this my uncle interrupted and said, we kicked ass about 900 years ago. Not just today""

I was amazed by all this and in shock because I was told my ancestors were just boring old farmers who lived Jordan and other parts of Europe for centuries, I still kinda wish my ancestors were members of the Hashshasin, but this is pretty cool too...

I didn't know where else I could share this information or who else would appreciate it so I figured this would be a pretty good place

I tried to raise enough money to pay my own way but, in the hope that they might see my work on their game as valuable and choose to help me out with funding. 

I know it’s a long shot

I just want to bring in a different perspective on those naval battles:

As an assassin, because in certain circumstances wearing your assassin robes would draw attention to you, instead of trying to avoid it.Why can't other assassins do this? Why can't an assassin who's job is to hunt down a Templar at sea, not dress up as a pirate? 

I seems to me that the common misconception is that an assassin doesn't want to be seen at all

Sure in places like medieval Jerusalem and Rome

In 18th century America/Carribean
That is why they embrace things like naval battles

It's not unusual or out of place for an assassin at all

I finished the main story of ACIII a week or so ago

It got me thinking back over the previous games

Looking all the way back to AC1

They were repetitive &amp; objective driven - like Altair was a blind follower. As the truth became clearer to him

Moving on to ACII, like he did.

The finale was epic and cathartic - fighting across the Vatican to beat down the man who destroyed Ezio's family with your bare hands.

Brotherhood was less epic and felt a bit more formulaic, not emotion.

But chasing down Cesare, like Ezio's state of mind.

Now onto Revelations. This game felt less about killing targets as it did about finding Altairs alien-dvds - again

So we're now at ACIII
Indeed

In the end

We never even got to strike the killing blow ourselves - it was all cutscene, acknowledging that they will always be enemies for the simple reason of being on different sides of a long-standing conflict.

So for me

* upon arriving, some hot bitch from ACII, who *totally* wants the dick. You give it to her.  
* the next morning, and lay the smackdown, before they decide to shoot back, knocking you off the wall and injuring you. You then help your sister and the civilians escape through a sneaky backdoor hidden in the villa. After this, the army's captain rocks up. It's Cesare (Che-sa-ray) Borgia, the ACII bad guy's son. He's a total prick (he also slips it to his sister. Filthy cunt). Unfortunately for you, he has Mario prisoner, and steals The Apple. Being completely powerless to stop the capture of the city
* you now wake up from the animus as the truck (you're in a truck) pulls into modern day Monterrigioni. Desmond, but not before noticing a secret message Ezio left behind: 1419,1420,1421.   
* back inside the animus, but told to go to a doctor (turns out you're now in Rome. Again). The doctor fixes you up, and tells you a man of your age should take more caution, which is a sneaky reminder that Ezio is now over 40 years old  
* you run around, which is essentially a bad guy base. There's a bad guy bossman strutting his stuff, so you murder him and set the tower on fire. Each 'suburb' of Rome has its own Tower; you have to do this in each zone to 'free' it.  
* you roam around Rome (hehe, the local base for the Assassin's Guild.  
* while running around doing odd jobs and recruiting assassins and training them (a fucking awesome addition, where you just get arrows raining down on every cunt around you all pew! pew! and ugh, I'm dying! and that), you learn that while Rodrigo is all sad and mopey cos you kicked his arse, his sprog Cesare is running around, snatching up Rome and taking as much power as he can (while still fucking his sister. Filthy cunt. She's hot, but still. *Sister*). For stealing your Apple, Ezio decides he needs the ultimate revenge: interfere with his plans. Mwahahahahaha.  
* you run around, while also helping your own friends too; Caterina had been imprisoned in his castle, so you save her. Bartolomeo (FUCKING. LEGEND) had his wife kidnapped so you help him too by killing some frog poofter. After pissing off Cesare enough, you sneak into the castle again to try and kill Rodrigo, only to find that Cesare does it for you. While killing his old man, his sister told him she knew where the Apple was (dad stole it and hid it, the thieving bastard) to try and stop him, you decide to have a race.  
* Ezio wins. Fuck yeah.  
* you then get to run around and show people the Apple, and Cesare finally gets fucking arrested (for incest. Sick fuck).  
* Ezio gets worried that Cesare will escape, just roll with it, ok?). He doesn't like wha he sees so he fucks off to get him.  
* turns out Cesare *did* escape. He also managed to gather another army. Fuck knows how though. It takes Ezio 4 whole years to catch up with him, so you chase him through a goddamn battfield and up onto the castle walls. You have a fight (which takes ages, but is really awesome), then grab him and throw him off the wall. Does he fly through the air in the manner of a bird? No. He falls to the ground with the manner of a housebrick.  
* the next thing you see is Ezio hiding the Apple in a vault underneath the Colloseum. When you finish, and Shaun's deciphering of Ezio's hidden number message, then finally discover the Apple.  
* **THIS IS WHERE IT GETS EPIC**  
  While free-running, appears. Only Desmond is able to see and hear her though, as she starts explaining how humans came to be. They were created to act as slaves in the same image as TWCB, but whereas they had 6 senses, they only gave us 5. However, there was eventually crossbreeding, which resulted in humans having the extra sense, Ezio and now Desmond are all descendants of TWCB.  
* upon reaching the Apple, he will have to find 'Eve'. The problem with this is, they think Lucy stands in the way of the pairing, so against his will, Desmond slowly walks over to her (while time is still frozen), and is forced to watch as his arm reaches out and stabs her with the hidden blade. Time resumes playing, Desmond and Lucy both collapse. Desmond stirs as he's being placed in a car. Credits roll.

I've been replaying all the AC games again, so I wanted to spark a discussion here:


Well, here are the things that I find weird:


1. In the ending of AC:B, nothing happens, but when Desmond does it works. In the vault, there is a similar pillar, and when Desmond touches it there appears some other pillar-thingy around the apple that you have to climb. Well, in Brutus' [drawing](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110511123656/assassinscreed/images/2/25/Scroll04.jpg) of the vault, those pillar-thingies are included. This suggests that Brutus also has TWCB DNA. 


2. Desmond and the gang solves the password by ""It's the 72 names for GOD!"", how did he solve this? Any clues? How did Ezio solve it?


3. In Brutus' [drawing](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110511123656/assassinscreed/images/2/25/Scroll04.jpg)
I assume the only rational explanation is that both used the apple for drawing?

A new pivot appears in game every 15 minutes.

Now for the tutorial bit. 

To place a pivot you need to travel around the map (As Connor) when you reach your destination

Go to the pivot map

Now assuming you have Atleast 3

The pivot will appear on your minimal when it gets in range. I can only describe it as looking a bit like the companion cube.",,t5_2s6v6,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/13vzv3/pivots_explained_for_those_who_are_confused/
1351990344.0,12l9ty,So you need help crafting? (A guide I made in response to someone asking. Thought I'd put it here for others who might want to ask.),kaberton,101,10,71,"Okay

* How do I craft things? 

 Well, in the crafting menu, pick a recipe you want to make, and see if you have the needed items to make it. If not, look at what those items are. 

 Let's say we want to make a barrel, scroll down to materials, and select the barrel recipe. We notice that we need one oak lumber, but we do not have one. So, exit out of the crafting portion, and scroll left to the stockpile. Under the tab that has everything the lumberjacks find, we see oak lumber. Go ahead and buy the lumber from them. Now we can make that barrel. 

 Some recipes call for things you have to make. Apple cider for instance, and I suggest following them so you're not wasting time on combinations that don't work. 
 
* Where do I find recipes?

 Well, you'll find recipes galore. You can also get recipes from leveling the artisans in your homestead. Which leads me to...

* Is it a good idea to / How do I level my artisans?

 You level your artisans by completing the homestead missions. Yes, tangent there. Leveled artisans can make better stuff, and that better stuff can either get you more money, or upgrade Connor.

* Make money

 Well, the war, the gangs, and even making honest money. However, if you know how to go about it, making money gets a little bit simpler. Early on, after completing the early homestead missions

* Wait

 Yes sir! Gone are the days of going to umpteen different stores for umpteen different upgrades for your assassin. Now it's all handled by crafting. Very early on you can see a recipe for dual holsters

TLDR: Use Recipes, sell goods, upgrade Connor.",,False,,t5_2s6v6,,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/12l9ty/so_you_need_help_crafting_a_guide_i_made_in/

1348414250.0,10ce5o,Story synopsis - Assassin's Creed 2,UnholyDemigod,107,17,31,"* the game starts with Lucy throwing Demsond into the animus for a quick second to get a memory onto a usb, where Rebeccae Crane and Shaun Hastings are (Shaun is fucking hilarious). Lucy asks Desmond to join them in the fight, and start up the memories of Ezio Auditore da Firenze
* 17 year old Ezio does some errands for his father, use his 'special talent' (eagle vision) to find a secret room, which contains some goodies and a letter which proves his innocence. He says to deliver the letter to Uberto Alberti, the local magistrate  
* upon finding the room, who says he'll clear things up in the morning.  
* the next day, and has him reassemble the broken hidden blade. He then takes his mum and sister to the brothel to hide, gets a bit of practise at being sneaky, finds Alberti at a courtyard, and murders the utter fuck out of him.  
* he gets his mum and sister and fucks off out off Florence, and his goons. Before they can kill Ezio, Mario, Ezio's uncle, rocks up and saves the day, before taking them all to Mario's villa estate in Monterrigioni.  
* Ezio wants to leave straight away to get revenge, Mario grabs a bunch of croneys and goes off to kill Vieri, who's been promoted from 'local dropkick' to 'major douche'. Ezio tags along, kills him good and proper, and even has the time to throw in some quality Italian profanity  
* after talking with Mario, and several Italian cities. Ezio gets totally awesome at murder.  
* Ezio finds out that the Pazzi have been working for somebody called 'The Spaniard' (probably because he's Spanish)
* Ezio gets pissed again, and it leads him to the Spaniard, who reveals himself as Rodrigo Borgia. He says some shit about a prophet and a prophecy before Mario and other friends Ezio made over the years show up and help fight the bad guys off. Borgia manages to escape unharmed.  
* Ezio's confused, which is exactly what Ezio did, meaning he's the prophet (***DUN DUN DUNNNNNN***). They then induct him into the Brotherhood.  
* there is then a glitch with the Animus, if not the world*. Fuck yeah.  
* you get to Rome, but he survives. You then fight. He takes the apple after you dropped it and sticks it onto the papal staff (which is another Piece Of Eden; turns out there's fucking shitloads of them) and uses magic because he's a cheating cunt. He beats you up, then activates a secret panel which opens a secret door, which leads to a secret vault (it's all very secretive), which only the prophet can open.  
* you follow him down to the vault door
* **HERE'S WHERE IT GETS EPIC**  
  An image appears of what looks like a holographic image of a woman wearing robes. She calls herself Minerva, they *created humans*, in their image to serve in subservience. It's from them that all deity myths originate. They were at the height of civilisation when something catastrophic hit (most likely a solar flare), that kill almost all of them and left only about 10,000 humans alive. They died, but humans managed to live on. She then tells Ezio that she's here to deliver a message to hopefully help prevent this from happening again. She then looks over Ezio's shoulder, and says ""it's up to you now
* Ezio gets confused

Other things: Desmond experiences the bleeding effect and learns freerunning and fighting, but then you have to escape your hideout.

And the there's 'The Truth'. After discovering a bunch of hidden stuff and solving a shitload of puzzles, a man and woman, running through a futuristic city. They see people working, guarded by someone holding the Apple, before it shows the two people climbing a building, then the man says ""I have it Eve"" and shows her the Apple. She calls him Adam and the video ends. 

The meaning of this is thus: Adam and Eve actually existed. They lived in Eden,,False,,t5_2s6v6,1348424755.0,,True
