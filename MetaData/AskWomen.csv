I was walking down the street on the way to work today and almost forgot about my ""master plan"" you all helped me with.  So I took out a business card - wrote my cell number on the front and on the back thought that since I was reverting to middle school flirting I would try and be a bit cute with it.  



So I wrote ""Will you go out with me? 

* Coffee (with a check box); 
* Lunch (checkbox); 
* No thanks



Saw her right around our usual place, she does the same and I hand her the card ""coffee-side"" up and said ""let me know tomorrow"".  



She was understandably a little thrown off


I had resigned myself to the full day waiting game but I just got back from a meeting and had a voicemail on my work phone.  



""Hi, 'I'll do either' but you were already too far away.  I wanted to give you your note back tomorrrow but feel bad making you wait for the answer, so lets talk soon and find a place for drinks after work"" and then left her number.




So score.  Thanks again for the advice and with a meeting story like this

+++++ **UPDATE 2** +++++

Went out for a drink last night and we had an amazing time, I came around the corner to a big smile, and was a bit unsure of the protocol, do we both stop, slow dow, etc.

[Original]http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/14vfku/reddit_women_unmarried_man37_will_be_having_his/

First I want to thank people for their advice on the original thread.  A lot of it was very helpful and it was a self confidence boost to know I was on the right track.  Thanks!

I've never been a particularly emotional guy.  Surely, started kicking my emotional butt but then she quickly followed that with a ""I'm so happy to finally get to  hug my Dad.""  It took every ounce of fake man cough I could muster to hold the tears at bay.  I start with this because it pretty much embodies her entire visit.  Between our initial meeting and her departure I had to use the fake cough, clearing of throat or sudden bathroom visit on more than a handful of occasions.  

We did a lot of fun things during her visit.  Went skiing

""I love you"" was finally said the night before her flight home.  Throughout the visit I danced around it a bit to see her reaction but I refused to have her leave without hearing the words.  That evening, medical school and several moves between different states after that.  More than once I placed it into the garbage only to go and dig it out later because I couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to our story together.  I took the opportunity to explain to her how I have a 5 year relationship with her in my memory that she doesn't equally share and because of this I need to tell her that I loved her.  I loved her then and I love her now.   As we sat in silence the moments following and I considered how a better man than myself would not have walked away, regardless of what a stupid DNA test said, I noticed her holding back the tears this time.  

So where does it go from here?  We've decided we're going to see each other monthly even though it's a bit of flying to accomplish it.  She also wants to spend spring break and summer vacation with me and I'm quite excited about it.   After an 11 year gap I'm a Dad again and I love it.

Thank you very

I hope you all had a lovely weekend :)

And before I post this, a eulogy and something akin to Travis Birkenstock's Most Tardys in the class honors acceptance speech from Clueless: 

I would like to thank Midol-with a special shout out to their Teen formula, for making the best organic tampons, they were never uncomfortable and they never let me down. 

I'd also like to thank Instead Softcup

To my ovaries

To the men at my favorite burger joint


To my uterus, I know it's not personal. I know you didn't fail on me, on purpose. We're just not a good fit anymore it seems and it's better for all of us, to just part ways. I appreciate you trying all these years, for us to make a go of it but it seems, my body and I will be in much better harmony without you. Sometimes their's nothing to do anymore but to say goodbye. 

And last but not least, I hope you don't care, I hope so very much, that I am enough. If you ever want to go to seek out your biological mother, I can't deny that a part of me wouldn't be hurt but I would still, absolutely support you. I can only empathize what it must be like but I can imagine it's only natural to be curious and have questions that you would want your biological parents to answer. I want you to know though, that whether we look alike or not, I don't give a damm. I'll do my best to be the best mum I can be and to me, it's this one thing but it's the only one that matters; that I was meant to find you in this world

Thanks in advance for any help.

My 13 year old daughter and I had a discussion the other day about weight. She is now about 5'7"" tall and weighs about 135 lbs. I told her that this is a very good weight for her as she is in GREAT physical shape with a lot of muscle from sports. I showed her graphs for optimal BMI, etc..etc...

Because her mom is 5'7"" and 115 lbs AND because her mom could NEVER stand to be fat my daughter feels she is fat. No matter what I tell her.

My daughter will probably end up to be around 5'10"" or so and I'm sure her weight will be much higher than now.

Is there anything I can say or do that will convince my daughter that she is a perfect specimen for a human woman? She is strong, but I listen for HOURS every week as she tells me her dreams, ideas, dislikes, and fears. I've always told her she can come and talk to me about anything. But on this topic (weight) it seems I have no influence.

So far the best thing I've found is to let them know how much it bothers me and to downplay it.  But even then usually their friend will say something like, ""Why even mention my job?""

Honestly using my job can be fun if I just want to hook up.  But when I'm looking for someone I might something more with, and it doesn't automatically make me a sexier person.

1355533708.0,14vfku,"Reddit Women!  Unmarried man[37] will be having his daughter[16] stay with him for a while.  The catch is, we haven't seen each other since she was 5.  Bonding suggestions?",incoming12yearold,431,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/14vfku/reddit_women_unmarried_man37_will_be_having_his/

At 5 years old I met my future ex-gf... At 16 we started dating and it lasted until I was almost 20.  Once we reached college we broke up as we went to different schools and it was an on again / off again relationship but we supposedly stayed faithful throughout... Supposedly.  I found out from her roommate that she was sleeping around and I decided to end it there... As luck my have it

I could write a small novel on this part of my life.   How I wasn't sure it was mine because I now knew she was sleeping with others.  She wasn't a horrible person for doing that, after all, the girl I grew up with all those years and I still cared about her well being.  

So not knowing if her daughter was mine or not (but assuming she was) I stayed in close contact with my ex-gf and acted as though the baby was mine.  I was supportive through the birth, distraught, hurt, and insisted on a paternity test.  The ex-gf agreed.   We did some research and had a paternity test sent in the mail... Now mind you this was back when mail order paternity tests was a pretty new concept.  It cost around $400 at the time and, as you will later find out, were not always done in a very controlled fashion apparently.  The DNA test returns 2 months later that I was not her father.  My ex-gf moves to have my name removed from the birth certificate and has a new one issued.  I left their lives that week and just tried to move on.  

Now at 37, you can see I didn't do such a great job at moving on.  I always felt like I left someone behind back there.  To say I was haunted by that young girls face would be an understatement.  I moved into a big city and I do pretty well for myself.  I haven't met anyone and got married because I just haven't met the right person.  I'm sure trust issues from the past come into play here.  Overall, though, I'm a well balanced guy with a great career and plenty of hobbies and FWB.  I know the FWB thing just makes me sound like a slimeball but I don't believe I am.  I hope I'm not.

2 months ago I get a call from a lawyer asking if I knew my ex-gf and her daughter.  He informed me that my ex-gf was killed in a car accident 2 years ago and reveals that I am, in turn, explains that her aunt (ex-gf's sister) was party to tampering with the first paternity test.  He suggests getting a lawyer of my own and getting another DNA test.  I get a lawyer and another DNA paternity test, this time under medical supervision.  My daughter, we'll call her Liz (not her real name), in her city half way across the country and me in mine.  Not wanting to be further manipulated it's done with lawyers involved and at a hospital.  The results come back.. Positive! I am her father.  (What the hell I'm about to cry just typing this).

Anyway.. Liz and I talk on the phone and skype and she's such a sweet amazing young woman.  In 2 weeks she's going to come visit me for Christmas vacation and I was sure to take the entire time off of work.  I want our time together to go extremely well but I'm here for some advice.

#1)  I haven't broached the subject that when I left Liz I was under impression that she was not my daughter.  That this impression wasn't just a whim it was written on what I thought was an accurate medical document.  I would have never left her if I had known.  *fucking tears again?*  I think Liz knows some of this, whom I'm sure she loves, manipulated and lied.  I'm fearful of ending up in that discussion but it's so important to me that Liz knows I didn't abandon her and her mother.   So I've been thinking about writing a detailed letter and completely leaving out any mention of her mother manipulating the test.. instead just say the fact that the test came back negative and give no explanation as to why or how.  Just leave it at that.  I won't mention that her aunt and mother tampered with the test and just shrug off any questions as to how the test came back negative.  

How bad of an idea is this?  Essentially lying to her upon our first chance to bond together again?  I hate the thought but how can I drag her mom and aunt's name through the mud like that?  I just don't know what to do about this.

#2)  At 16 what are some of the best things you can remember doing with your father?   I keep racking my brain on what to plan with her but all I come up with is ideas that I take dates on.   Stuff like ballet and theater.  Skiing and ice skating.  Cooking dinner together.   I come up with some great idea and it sounds more like a date than it does a father daughter thing.  How far off am I here?  I don't want to creep her out.

#3)  I've been biting my tongue on the ""I love you"" phrase..  Even though I do.  I spent the first 5 years of her life caring for her and having her sleep at my place.  She says she has very little recollection of that time but remembers some.  I left their life on that day but I kid you not when I say she stayed with me all those years.  In hindsight I wish I had stuck around regardless and been involved but I thought I was doing the right thing

#4)  If you were in her shoes

OK.. sorry for the small novel.  I appreciate your sincere responses as I'm really just trying to make this all work well for us.   I know from being a redditor a lot of ""ask"" type questions are more just ""read my story and comment"" posts but I'm really reaching out for a little advice here.

So




I was sitting on the couch, because I dont remember everything, but Im gonna write a summary:




I told her that I snooped through her phone, her eyes just got wider (she knew that I had discovered something she was hiding).




I told her I saw all the messages between her and the guy and that I was really disappointed in her. I told her that I never wouldve expected that of her. She got teary eyed and then started crying like I never saw her cry before. She was a wreck, but I hated to see the woman I love cry.. I hugged her. I just hugged her and I dont even know why. I was pissed, I was mad, but when she started crying, I broke down as well. I hugged her. Can anyone relate to this? Eventhough she did somethign very wrong, I still felt empathy for her... no idea why.




After she calmed down, no matter whether it was in real life or online. She started crying again. I told her we could talk about this after both of us have calmed down, but now I just needed to get away from her. I packed my stuff and left the apartment. She was sobbing at that point, but I knew I had done the right thing. I went to my best friend's house and stayed there for 3 days. I have gotten countless texts from her, but I have ignored them so far. I am moving into a new apartment on November first. I still love and miss her, but I know that breaking up with her was for the best. I just cant be with a girl who sends nude pictures of her to some random guy.




Whats funny though, but he just seems like a guy who liked a girl and acted on it. I cant really blame him. I just admire that he contacted me later on, asking me how I was doing. He seems like a good person.

  I've had this happen a handful of times

 
 **Edit:** Oh my. I didn't expect this thread to get so large or so heated.


  First

  After reading everyone's comments

  **1: The Slightly Uncomfortable

  This is when a guy and a girl become friends, fine, and normal.  I've been ""friendzoned"" like this quite a few times and usually stay friends with the guy, simply because I enjoy being around him in a nonromantic fashion, although I would have also appreciated the romantic side.  

  **2: The Awful

  This is when a girl and a guy are good or best friends, relationship.  He confesses his feelings and unfortunately, she does not return them, so he either grins and bears it or pulls away from the friendship to be able to actually breathe without hurting. **This is not what I'm talking about.**  I understand how awful this is; I've also been on the other side of this and fallen in love with best friends who wanted to stay just that--best friends.  I understand that it would be difficult to stay after something like this has happened, and again, this is not what I'm referring to at all.

  **3: [The Boyfriend Snuff Box Reaction](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLoPXNquIxM)**

  I think /u/SunflowerSamurai_ may have been joking

  In this situation, if she wises up enough to drop the boyfriend bomb (or does it unintentionally), he backs the fuck up right out of there and refuses to talk to her again.  Sometimes they even act angry that I was ""leading them on."" What I mean by treating women as ""not human,"" for this example only, of course, is when these certain men only talk to me because the only worth I have would be as a companion, not as an individual.  

  I am not saying these men are indicative of the men on AskWomen or on Reddit.  Although a few of you have called me a slut or an idiot
  

  However, ""just seem taken.""  Aside from wearing a ring, I don't know how I could also give off this impression.  

  To give you some context about myself and my question: I am 19 years old, there would be nothing wrong with that.)  I dress modestly, and talk openly and freely about my growing level of cat lady mania (so the lack of weirdness isn't the problem, I can tell you that right now.)  However, the problem seems to stem from the fact that although I am not an extrovert; I am an introvert, but I try to be kind and courteous to everyone I meet and talk to.  I understand that this not-rudeness can be misconstrued as interest.

**1. WHAT IS A ""NICE GUY""?**

&gt; **bash.org:**

&gt; A woman has a close male friend. This means that he is probably interested in her, but I don't like you in that way. This is roughly the equivalent for the guy of going to a job interview and the company saying, You have a great resume, you have all the qualifications we are looking for, but we're not going to hire you. We will, however, use your resume as the basis for comparison for all other applicants. But, we'll hire somebody else

This reasoning right here is the epitome of ""Nice Guy"" thinking.

Basically a ""Nice Guy"" is someone who wonders why if they are so nice and good to women

Some quotes that are helpful:

&gt; **Vulvarine posted:**

&gt; I think it's really important to distinguish between niceness and kindness. *Kindness is a real

    
&gt; **Ionic posted:**

&gt; One of the keys to understanding the Nice Guy vs. the clueless innocent is that the Nice Guy's definition of himself as such is usually the result of repeated romantic failure and a resulting

&gt; I don't want to make this into more than it is, vulnerable a woman can feel in the face of persistent attention, flattery, and the like. 

&gt; It flies in the face of years and years of social conditioning to tell an outwardly ""nice"" man - one who has in no way technically threatened, I'm not interested."" It's one thing to tell off the drunk who's trying to cop a feel on the subway (and even that isn't always easy). But rejecting the friend who just won't stop hanging around looking for more? It's not a simple situation.

&gt; So, we opt for subtlety instead.

&gt; And that's where the real problem with Nice Guys comes in. A regular guy would get the hint, on the other hand, will stick around and attempt to wear you down.  Often Nice Guys will pursue ""'hard luck' cases"" - women who are perhaps not the best-prepared to stand up for themselves. 

&gt; And in the end

&gt; To sum up, and the NG's persistence in the face of what many other individuals would recognize as subtle signals of mark's disinclination to mate. 

* **1.1 Manipulation**

NG behaviour is manipulative. NGs basically do everything they can to 'make' someone fall for them in an underhanded way. It makes every ""nice"" act revolve around the ulterior goal of getting with 'that' girl. They do it so hard that it becomes a second nature and they're not even conscious of it.

* **1.2 Unrealistic objectification**

NG behaviour ultimately reduces women to objects. While they would vehemently deny it, which blinds them to the fact that these women are independent people. 

* **1.3 Dishonesty**

NGs are not nice for the sake of being nice. They're nice because they think they'll get something in return. Granted that many people behave that way

* **1.4 It doesn't work**

Most women and many men can sense that you're a ""Nice Guy"", Y and Z so if I do that, I'll get laid"", the Nice Guy Technique has appalling success rates.

* **1.5 ""Ugh

Nobody likes assholes, have interesting stuff to say, are attractive or act like actual people instead of a scripted doormat.* Also, maybe her SO is acting hostile towards you because he can sense your true motives. 

* **1.6 Passiveness**

One particular reason why the ""friendship"" between an NG and their 'one true love' or whatever is shallow and questionable is that NGs typically don't go in against their object's opinions (unless their position is threatened somehow)

* **1.7 ""I am nice""**

NGs often describe themselves as being ""nice"", if the first thing that comes up in your mind, or in others' if you need to be described, is ""nice"", then you have a problem because it means you're not particularly seen as having personality.


**2. TYPICAL NICE GUY EXCUSES**

* **2.1 ""But I am genuinely a friend.""**

If you are, but prefer pining in the shadows, bottling up massive frustrations.

* **2.2 ""But in that movie/novel...""**

Popular culture tends to feed the idea that the NG thing is somehow cute, and if you're going to take dating advice from pop culture, well, then I don't know what to say.

* **2.3 ""If she doesn't like it

Nice guys make an advance that cannot be rejected in a socially acceptable way. If a guy says, then it's perfectly socially acceptable to say, ""Nah, I'm not interested."" But instead he might say, ""Oh, you're moving? I'd love to help. When? Hmm, I'm working that day, but I could rent one of those ones from the Home Depot."" Is this guy really helpful just generally, I am honor-bound not to accept your offer of assistance""? Of course not. So you don't say it, you relax a little

* **2.4 ""Welp

Apart from being a non-argument/false dichotomy (it's not one or the other), but with a mask of niceness. You can certainly be a nice person without the deeper layers of manipulation, self-pity and self-entitlement.

**3. HOW TO SNAP OUT OF BEING A ""NICE GUY""**

* **3.1** Realise that the world doesn't owe you anything

* **3.2** Stop being a passive-aggressive doormat and be more candid about your desires. This will mean having to take rejection

* **3.3** Don't pine. Realise that there are many

* **3.4** Realise that there is no ""manual"" to women, seek therapy.",,False,,t5_2rxrw,True,male,

So now I'm wondering how to **FIND** them.  I don't want to mention how I am too soon

What's going on is **extremely** fast premature ejaculation.  Basically, then sensation returns all at once and is so powerful I shoot while still completely limp.

I've tried everything including meds, I've decided it's probably some sort of nerve problem related to underdevelopment.  I've asked two doctors if that could be it and they both said such things are usually seen in combination with many other physical problems I *don't* have, but isolated development problems aren't unknown.

Anyway, because it never ends well.  If I do say something first she never returns another call; and if I don't, after seeing my ""performance"" she leaves as soon as possible, remembers why I can't stay the night after all, etc.

So.  Where can I go from here?  The only girl who stayed after finding out how I was had a sexual thing of her own that kept her from finding a guy, that probably wouldn't happen again in a thousand years.  Other than her, I've had no luck.  For a while I figured there must be girls with a fetish for zero-control, super fast guys, but if there are it's damn few.

In my mind

Being on the opposite side of most feminists I equate the mentality of ""the woman has a uterus so they have the sole right to abort"" to ""the woman has a uterus so they have to stay home and take care of the kids"".

But what if the father wants the unborn child

I am not recommending an as-is denial of choice to the mother. What I am saying is that if there isn't a rape

   * The mother is compensated as a surrogate as the child is no longer considered her own.
   * No child support is paid because the father has effectively adopted the child from the mother.
   * The mother is not given any custody of the child (as she wanted to abort in the first place

I feel like it's important to point out the fact that I'm overweight. Because I'm so overweight, but when it comes to dressing for HER body, I feel as though I would come off as petty if I gave her advice because she'd just think I was being jealous or insincere. If that makes sense.

So here's the scenario:

She was trying to pick an outfit to wear to my brother's high school graduation (she's tagging along with me). She tried on a tiny yellow strapless bra wrap thing and a skirt and asked me what I thought. 

I didn't know what to say about the fact that I could see her nipples through the (cheaply made) cotton bra. 

I don't like to put her down because she has had trouble with her self esteem and I have been really proud of the progress she's made lately. The fact that she is comfortable enough to wear more form fitting and revealing clothing tells me a lot about the progress she's made and when she feels better about herself

But it was my little brother's high school graduation, so I told her that the top was very see-through and that maybe she could wear something else. 

After that

It seems as though I can never win. 

How am I supposed to communicate the fact that I WANT her to look her best

My reasoning:
A woman does not need the man's permission to have an abortion or keep the baby. What if I was a man looking forward to being a father

She made a great counter argument that the issue of abortion is not about what happens after the baby is born

I accepted this as an answer to look at the issue from ""man wants baby

A man and a woman have sex and the woman is pregnant. The man decides he does not want to be a father

What do the women of Reddit think:
Should men be able to sign legal documents absolving himself of the responsibility of fathering a child

TLDR: Should men be able to sign legal documents absolving himself of the responsibility of fathering a child

**Edit:** Seems to me, having to live ""without"" because of a lack of support, etc.) When a woman has an abortion, the child ceases to exist, therefore no burden is placed on either party. I think this is a fair argument, and I realize now that a financial abortion may not be the best idea because of this. 

I am not changing my position that men deserve more rights then are granted to them

Today, it takes 2 people to have sex.  The burden of birth control is on both parties, and if one party fails to uphold their end of the deal, this creates a whole mess of issues for both of them.

Suddenly, I had to shut her down immediately and walk out of the store. She was shocked for it was the first time I said no to her as far as shopping for clothes is concerned. She is slightly upset, but seems to have come to terms with my explanation. Should I feel bad? 

We live in New York City and she is far more fashion conscious than I. I get her only name-brand clothes and have never considered price an issue. In fact

**ADDITIONAL INFO**: Her mother passed away last year and her father works 70-90 hours a week and travels quite a bit

**Allowance** I continued the system she had with her mother in which she received a sort of ""commission"" for getting A's or receiving trophies and awards. She is conscious that money is not infinite and is a big saver. She primarily uses money to buy gifts for others or to donate. Her mother was a charity worker abroad, growing up as a prep student in NYC will have a significant sway on that later in life I'm sure.

For the next three weeks (until yesterday) I tried to be friendly while he sat around and acted mopey. We had several discussions about our relationship; he maintained that he wanted to remain friends, but he was just taking time to get over the break up. I told him maybe he should take some time by himself, but he said he'd rather hang out with me. 

A few days ago he propositions me for casual sex. I said, no, I'm over that now."" I thought to myself, ""Yeah right!"" And I refused him. 

Then yesterday I receive an email from him saying that he's tired of me ""punishing him for one mistake"" and he's sick of the ""abuse"" I'm piling on him. Now this blindsided me. Here I am, and non-confrontational so he can recover and maybe we can be friends again, and he thinks I'm punishing him?

AskWomen prides itself on being a bit of a sanctuary from the rest of Reddit; and the Mod team works hard to create a place in which users are comfortable to both ask and answer questions. We take our sidebar rules seriously and when in the past we may have let a few of the rules slide

Some things we’d like to emphasize:

• **Posts must have a descriptive question in the title** that gives users the gist of the post. **Good Ex:** “Would you be mad if a guy asked you to buy different underwear” as opposed to **Bad Ex:** “Why was my girlfriend mad at this?” Posts without specific title questions will be removed and asked to repost.

• **This is not a dating advice subreddit.** If you are looking for dating advice

• **Harrassment, and personal attacks or any sort are not tolerated in this subreddit.** Those comments will be removed and you may be banned.

• People here will often have different opinions from yours. AskWomen is made up of thousands and thousands of individuals with individual opinions- **downvoting comments out of disagreement does a huge disservice to the community.** We don’t want to remove downvote arrows like some other subreddits, don't downvote it.** Which brings us to our next point...

• **Use the report button.** Reporting comments and threads that violate the sidebar rules is an immense help to the mod team. There are literally thousands of you and there are a few of us. Reports are anonymous and they do a great deal more to improve the quality of discourse than to attack disrespectful commentary with even more disrespectful commentary.  

On top of all that- just don’t be a jerk. Some of the topics discussed in AskWomen are sensitive and incendiary

**Tips on viewing the sidebar rules from a smartphone:**

*Reddit is Fun:* at the top of an individual subreddit page there is a little info button that looks like an “i” in a circle. Clicking that button will open a page with the sidebar rules.

*Alien Blue:* the middle button on the toolbar while accessing the subreddit will lead you to a page where you have an option to access the sidebar rules.

**Lastly:** Thank you so much,,False,,t5_2rxrw,False,,True

Most recently: New Year's Eve. 

My friends and I went to a fancy New Year's Eve charity event downtown, who also didn't have anyone to kiss at midnight. We absolutely 'clicked', it was amazing. It was one of those conversations that make guys remember why we don't just buy a fleshlight and register a Brazzers account. You know those types of conversations? They're great. 

[Not this](http://qkme.me/3sg3m5)

Needless to say, one of her girlfriends came over and stole her to go to the bathroom to do whatever the hell it is that you do in there. I assume it is anything but pee. I gave her a hug and told her if she didn't meet me at my table in 10 minutes I would send out a search party. Add a few seconds of good eye contact, and she was pulled away. 

At this point, and pretty much feeling like that Marlon Brando gif I've seen on r/ladyboners 1,000 times. 

I leave the bar and maneuver through the heathens to the other side of the venue, all of whom I know well and age from 22-25. I love them to death, but they're very 'protective'. So when my new friend returns from the bathroom, my friends go from being absolute sweethearts to some sort of mother bear clan who is protecting their cub from a nuclear charged alligator. My new friend comes up to me and put her arm around me, I return the favor and give her a quick side hug. In the two seconds the hug took place, body language changed. 

My friends now enter momma bear mode, put their phone in my pocket, etc.,  basically raising the level of physical contact. This, of course, made my new friend feel uncomfortable, and this was not the first time. They have scared other girls off before, some are too bitchy, too tan

I find it endearing, I'm 25, I'm not looking for a wife tomorrow. I've told them this, and they said they will stop when I find a nice girl that they can trust around me. So far that has been 1 person in the last 4 years, and of course she moved to Kansas. I value their input on girls that I'm considering dating, but if it's some girl I met at a bar and neither of us have dating intentions, I don't see why my friends need to be so judgmental. As my friends

I have talked to them about it

Apart from the obvious 'don't bring one-night-stands around you friends'

I generally make an effort to engage in small acts of kindness when I see the opportunity -- picking up a dropped umbrella, that sort of thing. I do this regardless of the demographics of the individual in need, and I usually consider myself a ""safe"" person to offer assistance to young women, because I am married and have a wedding ring on the usual finger. I figure by displaying my marital status, and offering assistance without offering conversation, and by asking for permission to help (when possible), I am not behaving in a threatening manner.

What I'm thinking about, but rather ""taking it to the streets,"" if you will, and taking a more active, engaged role in helping people when they're being bothered. That is, if I see a woman being catcalled or harassed, yelling out something like ""Mind your manners!"" or ""Knock it off!"" or whatever. I've done this a few times with women on the subway who are being harassed by a guy who's hitting on them too aggressively. I'll make eye contact and say, the guy usually wanders off

I guess my question is whether women in general feel like they are made helpless by random strangers helping them or defending them? Or is it a welcome gesture?  I might as well try to help

Or is there inherent in this gesture an implication that said woman cannot defend herself

I'm honestly quite torn about it.  I have to go for a bit

Thanks for your time.

I've noticed that a lot more pieces get eaten and I get more praise if I bake something when the daughter is on her period.

I was thinking of regularly baking when the daughter was on her period. I figured that it would be a nice thing to do. When I used to live with my girlfriend (we're now long distance) I did this and she loved it. Of course, but I don't think I'm close enough with her where I would feel comfortable asking such a personal question.

I wanna thank all of you for your advice, I wasn't really in a position where I could yesterday, but I read everyone's replies, and took them to heart. (Also, sorry I'm so long-winded)

The overwhelming response was that I needed to tell my girlfriend, I sat her down and explained the situation. I tried to be as delicate as I could, but it was hard for me to address the scenario without commenting on how I felt about her friend as a person. I never used a word as strong as ""toxic,"" but I think that could've been easily inferred from what I was saying. Besides brief questions about how I responded and what I thought, my girlfriend was silent and had a stoic face throughout most of my explanation. Maybe ""stoic"" isn't the right word... She sort of had a look as if she had always expected something like this would happen, and was emotionally prepared for it.

After a bit of silence, kissed me, and went off to her friend's house to talk to her.

If there's one thing I can say about this whole scenario, it's that I completely underestimated her. She's an exceedingly kind person, and she always sees the best in everyone, and I always mistook that as her being kind of a pushover, at least with her close friends. With her best friend in particular, it always felt like my GF going the extra mile was expected of her, but never reciprocated.

Anyway, and she got back with the same kind of determined look on her face. I pressed her for information, and this is evidently how their encounter played out (I have to do this - GF = A, friend = B. The following paragraph was a *mess*):

My GF confronted her friend directly. After some side-stepping and teeth-pulling, and was so childish, as to be ridiculous. I guess she told her friend things I had always perceived, but never really realized my girlfriend was consciously aware of. How B was selfish and demanding, and how she used her friendship with A as justification for the way she acted. She would never be able to have legitimate, adult relationships if she kept using A as a crutch, because that friendship validated the way she had always been. A pointed out how, all of B's friends faded from her life because of her refusal to put forth the effort they put forth for her

The discussion ended, but B needs to get her shit together before they can communicate comfortably again. She doesn't know if it will be weeks, or months, but my GF thinks their friendship should be worth enough for them to be able to overcome the radio silence that's to follow.

So, despite how I felt. As it turns out, this didn't really have a lot to do with me at all (largely because I think my GF trusts me, especially after this event). Her friend coming on to me (not how I would have phrased it before the responses I got yesterday, which my GF seemed to agree with) was just the catalyst for this discussion that was years in the making.

I'd say that, and I'd say she was pretty attracted to me being so forthcoming (due, in no small part, to all of you) and faithful (which I never really considered a question). So... thanks again!

1367877789.0,1dtjok,UPDATE: How should a transgender man approach a woman without freaking her out or scaring her off?,that_guy_ronald,213,48,75,"Alright

A summary of my last post: I was born with a female body but I am a man, very feminine women. This preference had not worked out well for me so far and lead me to get turned down a lot. My question to /r/AskWomen was how I could approach women and inform them of my “situation” without putting them off or scaring them off.

Alright

Well, per usual.

While I was doing that whole FWB thing, which was a challenge in and of itself, being in a new city and all. I would go out with my friends to break dancing clubs, burlesque shows, out to see local DJs and bands play, and just out to the bars. Basically, if there was something I wanted to do or see or experience, buy her a drink

Well, I got to hang out with some of my friends and do cool shit, and doing cool shit is fun.

**Relationship # 1**

But one of my friends really wanted to set me up with her best friend. I was pretty skeptical about this from the beginning. Basically, deep. Another thing, she mostly dates women. But, after my original post, I was more open to the idea of dating bisexual women.

So, if you follow me. No mystery, there. New Years Eve rolls around and we basically double date with our mutual friend. I kiss her at midnight, get her number, pay her tab, get wasted, dry out, and after that it was awful. The worst kind of dead fish situation. I’m not sure if she was intimidated or nervous

I should have listened to my gut to begin with. I honestly don’t think she’s into guys and I think she has a misconception about what it would be like dating a transman. I am not at all some kind of androgynous, so I decided to wait until after to break it off. Big mistake. She got weird and clingy and distant all at the same time and it was a bad two weeks. It’s over though, so, *whew.*

When I realized that I was consistently dating this woman from NYE I had told my FWB that I was seeing someone and didn’t want either of them to get the wrong idea about the situation

**Relationship # 2**

This whole time I had an account on OKCupid, but no one ever messaged me (which was frustrating) and no one ever messaged me back (which is even more frustrating). I was only checking it about once a week for shits and giggles and getting back into the concerts, bars, and burlesque show routine, but then I got this message from this woman with awesome dimples and a beautiful smile. She actually messaged me about Reddit, of all things, and I later found out that she had searched specifically for redditors (so thank you, for doing me a solid there). 

Within two days out brief messages became pages long and we set up a date. Wasting no time! Based on our profiles and messages, wine and dined her, did all my lady-killer moves and everything. Even though I was hella nervous (and so was she) we both had a great time. I kind of got ahead of myself and went for the kill. I asked her if I could kiss her, she said yes, and I did. I hadn’t disclosed yet that I was trans. I got back into my car and was basically yelling at myself. I had given myself that one rule: no physical intimacy before disclosure, based on my original post, and I broke it. This was the only time I broke that rule, though she didn't get the hint and I had to spell it out for her a week later.)

I knew I needed to tell her but I was pretty nervous about the whole thing. I ended up looking at her OKCupid profile again just to check if she had answered the ""Would you date a transgender person?"" question. Yeah, she did answer it. She had said ""no"". Well, damn. But I couldn't ignore the connection we had, and an answer on an online dating profile isn't a real answer or rejection, so I decided to just tell her and see where it went anyway.

So, since we were *thiiiis close* to planning our second date. I actually have the text messages from when I told her:

&gt; **Ronald:** Damn you beat me to it! I was going to ask you but I was cleaning my shower (it was awful). But yes. We should. Before we go ahead making plans I just wanted to tell you something. It's not a big deal to me but I want to be open and honest with you. I'm a trans guy.

&gt; **Girl:** That's legit. I appreciate you telling me. That's awesome that you're so chill about it.
It's not something I would go actively searching for

&gt; **Ronald:** Welp. That's fantastic. So
(feel free to ask me anything

&gt; **Girl:** Where to? I'm up for whatever. I had Thai tonight though
How long have you been on hormones? I'm assuming you must be? I don't know much about this whole thing. What kind of things do people normally ask? :)

And that’s basically how it went. I walked her through the bigger topics, and mostly we planned our second date. We saw a comedy show and had pizza. It was nice. She also slept over that night because we just didn’t want to be done with the date, though clothes stayed on.

Sex happend on date number three, and pretty much where I am in my life and transition. I think that if I was insecure with myself then she would have reacted differently. I think our success together has a lot to do with our mutual timing; she was finally in a good place with her stuff, I was finally in a good place with my stuff, and it just worked. When she mentioned being “bisexual” she was more-so referencing being attracted to masculine people, regardless of genitalia. She has never date women or been in a relationship with a woman. She’s only ever treated me as a man and I have never felt more comfortable in my role in a relationship.

We’re still dating. It’s been two months, and it’s given a whole new and exciting dynamic to sexy time.

So

**TL;DR** Fuck you. I just spent a long time writing that

EDIT 1: I just want to thank everyone for the positive response to this post. I know a lot of other trans guys also appreciate the fact that so many people understand why it's importnat to recognize the good stuff and to talk about it. My girlfriend ([TheDukesMistress](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1dtjok/update_how_should_a_transgender_man_approach_a/c9tt0e1)) also really enjoyed chiming in and adding her perspective. This whole experience has inspired us to start a collaborative YouTube channel in an effort to continue this discourse on relationships with trans men as well as to provide a resource for people who are new to coming into a trans relationship. We want to provide a resource that we would want

However, but it's not normal for her, so it kind of raised a red flag for me. Her work environment became increasingly flirtatious, and last week, it culminated in one of her superiors sexting her and sending two pictures of his penis. 

I talked to her about it, which she refused flatly.

Just yesterday at work, I urged her to report him, which she refuses to do.

This isn't her first case of sexual harassment at work, but when she did, she told her superior, the same guy that's harassing her now. 

I neglected to mention that her superior is 23.

Is there anything I can do to help her? I feel so helpless as her friend. What can she do

*EDIT:* Talked at length with her about it today, she doesn't think it's worth it. She also told me she got a call for a summer job north of where we live, so she's going to put in her two weeks this month.

Two years ago, perhaps). Without being too graphic, I am positive that I had her enthusiastic (and sober) consent. In the days following, she texted me a lot, and was just generally getting a little too attached (I was not interested in anything else happening at all, but apparently she was). I made it clear that I wasn't looking for anything else, and she took wasn't very happy about it. From then on

Fast forward to about two weeks ago. I'm out with the same friend who threw the Halloween party, spent most of the night talking to her, and she was sending every signal that she was into me (thanks for that, by the way - without the hundreds of thousands of threads here on the subject, I never would have known what was going on). I got her number, she went home, and I asked her out a few days later, but I didn't think too much of it

Then, last night), and was I going out? I said yes, and maybe I'd see her out. Thursday comes around, her friends bailed, I invited her along with us. She agreed, we had a great time again.

As I was walking her home, ""Well, can I be honest? I had heard... some stuff about you.""

Long story short, and ""Nancy"". She told me it was Nancy. She made sure to clarify that she didn't really believe it (otherwise, she wouldn't allow me to walk her home alone in the dark), but that was why she'd been leery to see me.

On Christmas Eve one year, insanely excited about Santa coming. All of a sudden we heard some banging on the roof, as if (hooves) something hard had landed there. Of course my mom played it up ""Did you guys hear that?!"" and my dad came running up the hallway into our room to ask if we all heard the noises on the roof. Of course my sister and I were freaking out, just **knowing** that Santa was here. Years later my mom of course told us it had been my dad throwing rocks up onto the roof while she distracted us. It had snowed, and he even left hoof prints on the front lawn for us to see. They would leave red and green glitter on the carpet around our presents too, as if Santa had left it there, and of course the half eaten cookies and the half-empty glass of milk would delight us too.

One time my mom came home from work and casually mentioned how a unicorn ran across the road in front of her on her way home. Sometimes when we would be driving through wooded areas

On St. Patrick's day, and green glittery foot prints everywhere. There was always two sacks of those cheap chocolate gold coins left hidden for my sister and I.

Basically, generally, get along with both of them famously, but I honestly don't like either of them. I mean, I enjoy hanging out with them on occasion, but I don't think they're good people. Some of the reasons are personal, but the main reason is absolutely the way they treat my gf.

I wanna be clear, compromises, always seems to give them the benefit of the doubt, she's just always going the extra mile. They would *never* do that. They're petty, self-obsessed women who expect the world to bend to their will.

For the most part, and there was a bit of a running joke where I would tell her not to respond to terrorism, but I know that despite the fact that I consider them lesser friends than her, that she's obviously getting something from her relationship with them, she *can* and *does* have a good time with them.

Anyway, but I had nothing else to do and they wanted me around). We went out and were all drinking. Everyone was pretty drunk, and my gf's two friends got into their zone where they were talking about extremely trivial things and about themselves. It was *impossible* to get a word in. It used to bug me, but I've gotten used to it, and I'm guessing my GF grew accustomed to it ages ago. I wouldn't even describe what they were having as a conversation, they were literally just talking at each other, at the same time.

So, ""Watch this!"" Basically what she said to them, none of which got through to them, was that she thought they were shitty friends, and they were assholes, and that she couldn't stand them, and that she's done so much for them and they don't appreciate at all.

I realize she was drunk, but it *totally* broke my heart. My gf is an optimist, and she labors to see the best in people, and I always accepted that as the reason she could tolerate these girls. In that moment though, she was practically tripping over herself describing things about them that I've never realized she was totally aware of.

It's just not fair, deserve her. I try really hard to be for her what she is for them, but I get that it isn't the same. She needs something from them (or, I'd hope, any female friend) that I couldn't give her. She probably doesn't even remember any of this, and she'll likely happily hang out with them again soon, but now I feel like, it must be how she feels a lot of the time.

I don't really know what I can do about it. It wouldn't be fair of me to sit around bitching about how awful her best friends are, even if she met really awesome new friends, she'd still always be friends with these girls. It's just.... you know, they'll always be friends, I can see that, but I can't stand it, and I guess sometimes neither can my GF.

Is there *anything* I can do about this? Should I confront her friends? Is it none of my business? Should I encourage scenarios where we meet new people more often

I am a fairly easy going guy. I don't let too much upset me and I try really hard to keep my girlfriend from being upset as well. She is very easily upset, to relieve the problem or at least keep her from crying. Most of the time I just reinforce that I love her and that she doesn't need to worry, and that works after long laborious reiterations of the same thing. I can deal with this on occasion but over the course of three years she has been in these moods nearly 3 nights a week, every week. Of course, there are some weeks here and there that she is in a great mood and everything seems to be going great, and those are the weeks that hold us together. But more often than not we have a bad week. Her anxiety is so high that she is always worried about literally everything that I say or that she says. I've asked her before if she would possibly see a therapist or think about getting on anti-aniety drugs but she sort of waved off the idea. When in the car she screams and swears at all the other drivers or the red lights, usually there is nothing out of the ordinary for a normal day of driving. I almost never hear her being positive and that is making me feel as if everything, is negative for her.

I find that my enjoyment of life is diminished when I'm around her when she's in these moods. Like I said

A month ago we all go out to the club and me and her end up hooking up. We danced together and she stole a kiss from me. I tried to pull away because she has a boyfriend (I even reminded her)

The next night she says she was too drunk to remember anything that happened

From then on the entire dynamic of our friendship changed. We would only see each other when we went out to the club or bars, or resting her head on mine. She would put her arm in the small of my back, and look deep into my eyes when we would talk. She would call me her favorite boy or announce to all our friends that I was her life partner. 

I never made a move because she had a boyfriend, and I went home the next. We ended up not seeing each other for more than two weeks, and so I decided next time that I see her I would ask her out or at least tell her how I felt.

So I go to this party and see her there. She's real excited to see me, and then I back off and go to one end of the dance floor. She goes to the other end and looks at me hard before motioning for us to go outside.

I'm thinking this is my chance to talk to her

I ask her if we can talk in private, and I'm sitting down in shock pretty much. She's making excuses why she'd be a bad girlfriend (she says she travels). Eventually I'm just like, fine we'll just be friends. She agrees and we go back to our friends.

She tries to leave the party without saying goodbye but I get her to hug me. Its a real tight hug and she's resting her head on mine. After all of that I went and danced with some other girl to blow off some steam and she saw and might've gotten jealous.

Next day I see her it's a group situation and she's rather cold towards me. So I just bug out after a couple hours. I have strong feelings for her,False,,t5_2rxrw,1350231854.0,,,t3_11gqll

* **Porn**: what kind of porn do most women enjoy and where can I find this? I've seen a few James Deen videos; they're pretty awesome
* **Tampons**: Not directly related to sex, obviously. When I tried inserting one during my period, it just wouldn't go in completely (smallest size). Might be psychological, I wouldn't know. And then it really started hurting and I nearly fainted - recovering from that took a good number of minutes. I'm not sure why - is it possible to insert a tampon ""the wrong way""? Should I see a doctor about this? :/
* **Masturbating**: How does one do this properly? Some articles I've read recommend sticking a finger in but I've only ever been able to get half a pinky in before chickening out (perhaps related to the section above
* **Orgasming**: Don't think I've ever experienced one (at least not from my pitiful attempts at masturbation). I'd really like to. Which brings me to:
* **Sex toys**: I'll be honest - I barely know anything about these at all. Should I invest in a sex toy to assist with my dastardly masturbation plans? What do you ~~guys~~ ladies use? A vibrator sounds like fun but I wouldn't know. There's also the small problem that I'm a college student with no means of transportation (not to mention I'm far too embarrassed to walk into a sex-toy store
* **Sex**: It seems from [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/13xj9w/how_old_is_too_old_to_be_a_virgin/) that while many women do not think virginity is necessarily a problem

Many questions (that reveal my complete lack of understanding of sex)

Not sure if this warrants a follow-up or not

I spoke with her last night intent on getting to the bottom of things. At the end of the conversation I was either going to convince her there's no negative aspect of waxing aside from maybe some temporary stinging - OR I was going to drop it for good.

I (subtly) buttered her up for the day/evening, after dinner and drinks, we went back to my place and talked a bit. That's when I brought it up. 

I started off explaining the differences between shaving and waxing, and she confirmed. I asked her if she really understood this, then why did she not want to do it? She replied that it doesn't bother her, she's okay with it, and I should be too. She asked me if I really wanted her to take care of it, and I (honestly) replied yes, but also insisted that she is beautiful regardless

She said she would do it, but she wanted me to go with her (she didn't want to go alone) and she wanted a good lunch afterwards.

Third


Now I'm stuck on how the hell you ask someone if they want to become FWB. I absolutely do not want to have sex with her without her knowing that we have a FWB situation worked out


So, should I mention an STD check or anything? I'm clean and I'm 99% sure she is, but you can't be too careful. I also don't want our current relationship to be ruined if she says no. I'm not worried about it being awkward, I just don't want her to be mad at me if this doesn't work out. 


How do you suggest I go about this? 
How would you prefer a male friend to ask you? 
What should my backup plan be to save our friendship if she says 'no'?

However, and to further compound this, several years ago I sustained an injury that gave me a zipper-scar running up my left leg, and cost me a good portion of my left forearm, which has been replaced with steel and carbon fiber. More than one of my female friends, whom I only met after getting what can only be described as a ""claw"", confessed to me that without knowing my personality, or just keeping a respectful distance, and most importantly people get out of my way when I'm on a mission
My presence seems to carry some weight, what is relevant is I saw myself as a completely transparent jabbermouth the day he said that. I guess what I'm getting at is, I know I look scary, but apparently my demeanor isn't quite what I think it is, and it certainly seems to be compounding the scariness, even when I feel like I've more than dispelled any illusions of me being a scary person. I think part of the reason people are afraid of me is because my face isn't very expressive, and I ""appear as if always in deep thought, and since people fear what they don't know

But being feared has cost me romance. A guy might ignore any fear at the sight of me, because what must she think of me if I do this? On the off chance that she is not afraid of me, then she would see my injury and despite her best intentions, judge me by it, as it is one of my more distinguishing features and thus will be a big part of how she sees me in her mind's eye. If she is afraid of me, then who knows how she'll react to my pathetic attempts at flirting. Honestly, I'm really just a loving/caring guy

I'm lonely, and I think that caring about someone will give me energy which I would use to make her happy. I don't know where to go from here.

So, who helped me approach the situation more delicately and thoughtfully than I would have. *Wall of text, sorry!*

Anyway, I would make a point to compliment (this wasn't nearly as awkward as it was happening as it is typing this out haha) her vagina, and I'd kind of ask about her need to hide it from me. She would tell me that she thought it looked weird, or that it would smell funny, or what have you, and I'd alleviate her concerns without being pushy or turning the conversation down a particular path.

This sorta culminated in a disaster. I'd estimate that I'm in the mood and willing to have sex maybe 90% of the time (I can control myself, I made the fatal mistake of jumping at the opportunity when she was in the mood and invited me to go down on her, despite this being probably the only time over the course of our relationship that she was in the mood and I just.... wasn't. I guess I didn't want to lose the opportunity.

Anyway, and then she just really wanted to start having sex (though she was enjoying it, I learned through this process that although she doesn't climax often from penetration, if she's really in the mood, that seems to kinda be a requisite for her). This turned into me tearing the apartment inside out looking for a condom (she's not on the pill), and then having to get dressed and go outside to the car to grab some. This completely killed the mood for me, a mood that I kinda had to labor for to begin with. When I got back in, but try as I might

I totally know I should have told her from the beginning that I wasn't really in the mood at the time

Anyway, and she explained to me that whether or not she felt comfortable with me going down on her didn't change the fact that she just prefers penetration. It'll get her warmed up, but it won't get her where she wants to be. We talked about other stuff, too, but that's all that's relevant to this topic (and I'm already talking your ears off!). The next day, we ended up having sex several times (which hasn't happened since the first few months of our relationship), and she finished every time.

So, it was in taking your advice that I came to discover these things, so I wanted to say thanks:

**I was quantifying the value of an orgasm based on my experience as a man, I enjoy the act of sex, but if I don't ""finish,"" then it's essentially a failure for me. My girlfriend enjoys the act of sex, and whether or not she climaxes doesn't devalue that experience for her at all.

**There's a dramatic difference between my girlfriend being willing to have sex, she'll always enjoy it, but she'll *rarely* finish. When she's horny, it's actually insanely easy for me to bring her to orgasm. It just took me a while to really grasp this concept since when we first started dating, our sex life was a frenzy, but now we have sex much less frequently and it takes me longer to figure things out. I've also learned that giving pretty much every inch of her body equal attention, and making it much more blatantly obvious that I'm attracted to her

Discovering these two things (along with a much longer list of smaller things) has honestly made sex so much more comfortable and enjoyable for both of us. I'm confident I can get her to finish when she can

Anyway, and thank you guys (whether it was your intent or not) for making me way more sexually self-aware and way more curious and thoughtful about the female sexual experience.

**tl;dr** GF allowed me to go down on her. Turned out super awkward, coupled with the advice I got here, has created an immensely more comfortable and enjoyable sexual experience for both of us.",,False,,t5_2rxrw,,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/uryqq/update_my_girlfriend_absolutely_does_not_want_me/

My GF and I have mostly mutual friends. I've made a concerted effort in our time together to endear myself to the few friends she has that I wasn't previously friends with. Over time, etc etc. It became common enough that if my GF or I had something to take care of while we were all hanging out, the other would continue to hang out with her. After a few awkward times like this where, if I was with her, we'd sit in silence and watch TV, we eventually opened up and got comfortable with each other.

In the past, her friend is extremely physically attractive. I totally assuaged her fears, I made it clear, in absolutely no uncertain terms, that I had never and absolutely would never think of her romantically. I enjoy lounging with her, but I've learned to bite my tongue and quickly change the subject because of pretty tremendous differences in personal beliefs (nothing like religion or anything, just social and personal issues). Deep down, but when we keep things totally surface-y

Anyway, my GF got a call that was gonna keep her away for the majority of the day, and it was just me and her friend. We were talking for a while, and she seemed distracted. I asked her what was wrong, and then... yeah. She told me that she has ""strong"" feelings for me, but that she'd never pursue them because she loves my girlfriend, and she knows that I do as well. She essentially said she just had to air her feelings and that she'd let it go. I blurted something out about being flattered but being head over heels in love with my girlfriend

I totally get that I need to keep a hefty amount of distance from this girl now. I have no qualms finding friends to hang out with when she's around (I don't know how long that'll have to go on for, but she's essentially a hermit. My GF is basically her only friend at this point).

My problem is how I approach this with my GF. It seems like a no-brainer that I tell her, and this girl wouldn't. This just seems like another instance of.... I don't know if ""betrayal"" is too strong of a word. I just feel.... angry, and sad.

Beyond how I might feel if one of my friends expressed an interest in my girlfriend without telling *me* about it, but I can't shake this feeling that ""she deserves better."" But these two have been friends for over a decade now.

I'm sorta all over the place. I'm confounded why her friend would tell me this at all, even if I were to just keep quiet about it and do the distancing myself, if my GF found out about this from anyone other than me, she'd feel like I was keeping it from her for some ulterior motive.

My girlfriend and I had a conversation the other day that I'm still trying to wrap my head around. She was telling me about her previous job as a waitress. The bosses apparently had sex with many of the waitresses. She wondered why none of bosses ever propositioned her for sex. Here's how the conversation went.

Me: Well if one of your bosses had asked you for sex

Her: Nooo. No no no. Well maybe. It depends on the situation.

Me: What do you mean?

Her: Well if I was feeling threatened and I felt like the situation might turn bad


That blew my mind. She was basically saying she would have sex with someone to ""avoid"" being raped. We had a long conversation

She also revealed that when she was younger

In the first, and she mentioned that she had lost her virginity to a friend. He said ""We should have sex."" She felt threatened (although she admits that had she said no, the guy might have backed off,) and willingly said yes and had sex with him. She also had sex with him at a later date. She convinced herself that she wanted it and didn't realize she didn't till our talk yesterday.

In the second scenario, he asks her if he could take her up on that offer. She felt panicked, and gave him a blowjob, even though she says that he was a nice guy and wouldn't have forced anything on her had she said no.

There were other situations in which she said she might have done the same had the circumstances been different. She said she'd rather have ""consensual"" sex to avoid the pain of a rape (she can tell someone to slow down in consensual sex.)

I honestly can't wrap my head around it. I'm not a female, I'm reserving judgement because it's unfair of me to judge. I just don't understand it at all. I'm curious to hear other women's input. Can anyone here relate?

TLDR - GF has and would willingly have sex if she feels threatened in order to ""avoid"" rape.

EDIT - My GF has seen this post and is fine with the way it's worded. No details are left out that she thinks are important. Also, neither of them would have raped her had she said no. She felt threatened though for whatever reason and felt like having sex was her best option.

EDIT 2 - Holy shit. This thread blew up way more than I expected. Let me just clarify one thing. The scenarios that my girlfriend was in were **NOT** rape. She gave consent. Both those guys would have been completely fine with a ""no."" Had they coerced her in a any way, then go ahead.

I'm not making rape jokes or anything

My college has those posters saying ""1 in 4 college women will be sexually assaulted"". I want to become more sensitive to potential triggers. Are there things I should do differently if I learn that one of my friends has been raped/assaulted? Should I err on the side of caution and assume *every* woman has experienced some form of sexual assault?

Here is some of the advice given in the last post (to name but a few).

* From ""suzepie"":
You wanna get me off? Start off by avoiding my clit. Avoid my pussy 
completely. Touch everything else. Touch my neck
thighs
Kiss my stomach. Kiss the small of my back. Very lightly touch my 
breasts. Do it till my nipples are hard. Touch the area just around 
them. Avoid the actual nipple for a while
gently. Do not slobber or mash down on my breast while you do so. 
Take the nipple in your teeth
flick with your tongue. Go back to the touching and kissing. If you 
can keep this up for, I will be begging you 
to touch my pussy. Begging you to enter me. Think of it like this: 
You don't excite the clit and/or vagina by touching it. You excite 
it by doing all this other stuff
You whet its appetite by making all these other sensual promises
all over the body. It gets jealous. It wants some
to prepare itself for its turn. And then
little sensation down there will be amplified tenfold. The feeling 
of penetration will be godlike. The orgasms will come so much more 
easily. TL;DR: Don't go straight for the goods. Do the opposite. 
(At least for this woman.)

frickin' mind; I found out he read that book. I looked it over and

Just as a background

I basically from then on out repressed all sexual urges until I was 18, many jokes I learned jerking it was perfectly normal and not to be ashamed of myself. Like right before I got out one of my bosses told me he knew of an escort service that could help me kind of get over that first hump, so to speak, but I declined because that wasn't how I wanted it to happen.

Once I separated from active duty I started going to school at 22 and it's been about a year since then and I've been on a few dates

The first time I had been on a couple of dates with this girl I met in one of my classes and she invited me over via text with the express purpose of ""watching the opening credits of a movie"" with her and told me to pick up condoms on the way. Now, that was an awkward class for the rest of the year, but I figured maybe she got freaked out because I did it over text.

So a couple of months later I'm being undressed by this girl I like

The third at least let me down easy

I'm starting to think I should just not say anything next time and get it out of the way and let my poor performance speak for itself, these were just girls that I liked and was hoping to be intimate with at some point, but since then any time I try and talk to someone I'm even remotely interested in, be it purely physical or something more than that I quickly shoot myself in the foot and I'm getting a tad bit anxious.

The first year of our relationship we used condoms and we would both buy condoms so we would have some at my place and at her place. We've been together nearly a year now and we decided we'd like to go without condoms so my GF went on the pill.

I was just thinking about it the other day how I've saved a little bit of money since I stopped buying condoms and maybe it wasn't fair that she now is solely responsible for buying contraceptives.

Should I offer to pay for half? She's never mentioned anything about it.

It's only been this year really that I've gone from ""I 100% never want kids"" to ""I might want kids in the future. Maybe"".  

It's still something I'm highly unsure of, I know my boyfriend (23) almost definitely wants them; and while we've only been dating a year, I'm completely in love with him, and I'm almost certain he's the one I want to spend the rest of my life with. 

I'm not so much against kids, but at the moment I don't know if I'll ever be in the position of actively wanting to conceive a child.  

Mostly, of not being able to accomplish my career goals, and of  not being able to go out and enjoy myself without responsibility. I'm also terrified of the physical toll pregnancy takes.


On the flip side, more often than not, is overshadowed by this fear. I'm afraid of the ""what if I never want kids?""

So naturally, having a reputation among our group of friends as being ""crazy,"" but now she wouldn't even look me in the eye. I've never seen her like that. Anyway, I didn't want to push whatever was making her feel this way, so I tried to change the subject as casually as possible.

Then, like she was embarrassed -- told me that earlier the closest she's ever gotten to living out her biggest fantasy. A little more (gentle) prying, and she tells me that the thought of losing control turns her on. Eventually (finally) she tells me that she ""wants to feel raped,"" and that she wants me to try it with her (her exact words). I want to emphasize that I'm not reading between the lines here, she explicitly told me she wanted me to try raping her.

I don't have a problem doing kinky things, I've had rough sex before, and I like being pretty dominant, but I don't have much experience with anything like this. Can anyone give me advice of any kind? Is this a common thing? I'm pretty lost at the moment.

LDR SO and I have been dating for 8 months.

I found out the other day she cheated on me as a one time instance. She has expressed guilt, and disgust for herself. Her knowledge that she effectively ruined me makes it all the worse for her.

Apologies aren't enough, I have decided that perhaps this is worth salvaging. She has expressed multiple times that nothing is worth losing me over, and she is willing to do whatever it takes to keep me in her life.

Me wanting to move forward with this, but it's difficult right now.
It's worth mentioning that we're in a LDR

Despite the fact that she has cut contact with the offenders
What concerns me the most is that she vehemently refuses to disclose our relationship to her internet guy friends. She says that she's not ashamed

Even before she cheated on me I knew she felt that way, after all, the person she cheated on me with didn't know about us either.

Are my thoughts rational, with her just simply refusing to disclose what we're doing. Of course I don't expect anyone to simply, out of the blue, be like, ""YEAH, I'M DATING CHEATEDTHROWS"". No. But you can certainly work it in a conversation. She won't do that either.

**TL;DR: LDR Girlfriend cheated on me with a guy that had no idea we were dating. Despite the fact she removed them from her life, citing the reasons as it's nobody's business and she feels like if they know about us, they will feel uncomfortable around us because we all play games together.

* The restaurants close down at 9 PM on the weekends
* Everyone at my company is male and over 40 (there are 2 people younger than 30 and I'm one of them...)

Things I have tried doing to meet people:

* I joined a gym and go 2-3 times a week
* I go out for jogs around my neighborhood hoping to meet people my age who live nearby
* I checked meetup.com all summer but there is nothing other than new mom groups and singles over 45 clubs within a 45 minute drive

[Here I am

Growing up, but awkwardly dressed pre-teen. I was rejected by my crushes in junior high school and that took a toll on my feelings of self-worth. Then I got older and started to grow into myself. I hit puberty (of which I am incredibly grateful), and have looked pretty much the same from high school on. Now I find myself attractive. I still have battles with feeling ""good looking,"" since I grew up in a primarily-Caucasian area and did not follow the ""ideal"" standards of beauty. But nowadays, I get complimented often and am pretty aware of my attractiveness level. Obviously I don't do it for everyone, but I think I'm pretty damn cute.",,,,

Directly sex related (blowjob enjoyment

This subject brought to you by a conversation I had with one of my best friends recently. We'll call him Jacob.

I met Jacob through D&amp;D. My first perception of him was that he was a typical gaming geek. He's shorter than I am, and extremely shy around strangers and new acquaintances. We met each other a little over a year ago and now he's part of my inner circle of friends.

Jacob has no martial arts training. He's not a gym rat, he doesn't have secret ninja abilities. What he does have is deep and unshakable **moral courage**. We've been in a few sketchy situations together, and instead of shrinking back he stood shoulder to shoulder with us, even when the consequences would seem more dire for him than the rest of our little group. He stands by his beliefs with the kind of equanimity that most people wish they could have, accepting the opinions of others while staying true to his own.

He's the biggest badass I know, he shouldn't have the courage of confidence to do so. He always, always does the right thing, regardless of the cost to himself. So, what makes a man a badass to you?

One: a girl who is fun, dresses well and is reasonably attractive (she has recently gained weight due to student living and significant recent stress but there have still been people interested in her) who sabotages her potential relationships by never really ... I suppose the best way to put it would be never making the effort or extending herself. The last few guys she was interested in actually seemed pretty interested in her, and we know for a fact that one was, but she never told him how she felt and he asked out another girl. When she has been in a relationship or in a situation where one might happen she often tends to pull away and/or not really bother to hang out with the guy, because deep down she's always rather ambivalent about whether or not she wants a relationship - or whether she wants anything, really, as this applies to her study/work life as well. So even though she complains about being single it often seems like that's more about feeling unwanted than anything else.

Friend two is a massive girly girl, or telling him she was interested) because ""that's the guy's job"". On a recent first date she gave a guy a link to her online poetry and you can imagine what sort of bitterness was in those poems. She's also just irritating as hell in daily conversation. She really is very pretty but looks just aren't enough in this situation.

My friend Rachel was complaining because she had to take her daughter to one of those Godawful child-fun factories, I opted to share the burden with her and I said I'd go with them.  When I meet up with them at their house she told me her 15 year old cousin Sara would be coming with us.  Sara's mother died a couple of years ago leaving her an orphan.  She had been home schooled her whole life

I had watched from a distance this girl go through these terrible tragedies, raised, and married off friends of mine.  When someone abandoned two baby pit bulls (runts) in my backyard a few years ago I tried caring for them while I found them an owner.  They offered to watch them for a night to give me a break. I never got them back.  It's the most adorable thing, this older Jewish couple, artistic and educated with these two nasty, slobbery *giant* abandoned fighting dogs. When I met Sara she was a sad 10 year old orphan who had never interacted with the outside world and they've done a great job raising her but she clearly was ready to assert her personality.

And God damn what a personality.  She came out in matching turquoise skirt, when the conversation turned to if there were any other orphans in her school she mentioned a classmate and friend named Katie who was also the only *other* lesbian in school.  

Once we got to the Godforsaken torture chamber of childrens screams we huddled together to fend off interaction with the unwashed masses.  Sure we were pleasant and polite with the few much older parents we were obligated to interact with due to the nature of the birthday party, and about her friends, but she kept bringing up the topic of sexuality.  Eventually I started asking her questions because she clearly wanted to talk about it.  She said most of her friends were the other gay students, except for one ""kinda weird religious kid Charles who says lesbians are ok but gay guys are weird.  His church is supposed to be all about acceptance but conversion"".  She also mentioned that Rachel was the first family she came out to, and that was just the prior day.  She's not concerned at all about her family accepting it given their liberal background, and I think a part of her does wonder if this is just a ""phase"".  That wasn't all we talked about, and oh God... teenage boys are such idiots and jerks.  I told her a story about how when I was in high school I openly mocked a girl for her cutting scars, spoke to me like an adult

1357770136.0,169wzy,Female death-grip?,twlife10,100,21,36,"Hello ladies!

I'm a 19 year old female and I have this problem--the female version of death grip masturbation. I started masturbating at a rather young age--7 or 8--and have done it in a certain way ever since. I cross my legs and sort of squeeze my thighs together until I orgasm--usually doesn't take me more than 5 minutes. 

This does lead to wonderful orgasms so I'm not complaining, or from manual stimulation. And yes, I know a lot of women can't orgasm from sex alone so we do incorporate clit play but I need so much pressure that it becomes impossible and tiring for both of us.

My SO is away this entire month so I want to try and solve this problem. I know I'm going to have to stop masturbating the way I do. I've tried before but it's really hard not to get impatient/frustrated so I just end up giving up and going back to my old ways. 

What I'm asking is have any other ladies out there experienced this issue? If so

What are some tips you can give me about masturbating? I've conditioned myself for all these years and I really want to break this cycle. Please help!",,t5_2rxrw,False,,female,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/169wzy/female_deathgrip/

 The friend is going through relationship issues and he and my wife talk at work and after hours via text and chat. A while back and a few times he has told her that he thought he had a chance with her until he found out she was married. He has mentioned that he was turned on by her once and had to leave the room. He has told her that she is attractive and funny and geeky and that is rare in a woman. 

 I have never met this guy. He is socially awkward and doesn't want to meet or hangout with people. I finally told my wife that I feel that's odd and I would like to meet him. She has tried to get him to hangout but he still doesn't want to do it.
So we had an argument about it.
She gives me two options to resolve this.
1
2
I feel that either of those makes me to be a horrible person.
Either I'm the guy who doesn't let his wife have friends or my wife has some unknown attachment to a man I don't know.

It feels odd to me and I have never been a jealous type.
She says I have lots of female friends and this is true. But I try to include her in every aspect of my friendship with these people. I game with these people and they live in other states. And she can and has been invited to game and chat with all of us anytime.

Like I said, but this one just makes me feel odd.  
So now we are on pins and needles and she thinks I don't trust her.
If I had a female friend I would want her to know my wife. If I were friends with a woman who had a SO I would want him to meet me so that they know everything is on the up and up as well. 

So

*Edit* So we talked some more and I let her know my big red flag. She spoke with GUY1 and let him know that her HUSBAND would like to meet him yet again and that it is causing issues with us. I thanked her for letting him know this even though it is ultimately his choice

And finally, I dress excellently, I have a great education and an awesome (if rather nerdy) job, I'm tall, I'm confident and I have decent amounts of cash. I am well mannered and will treat everyone very well. I've also been told by friends that I'm handsome, but that's clearly a subjective thing and I'm not one to boast. I live in Los Angeles, which has about the worst singles male:female ratio in the country.

I want a strong independent woman. I can't have a woman who is going to blow up and go crazy (like my last girlfriend, I am shallow), and to love sex and touching and loving.

Since then, pour a glass of wine, and take up the whole kitchen.  A lot of the dishes I make are inspired by pictures on the internet, but I rarely go by recipes so there have been some **epic** fails.  I have a few vegan/ vegetarian friends and family members, so although I eat meat I like the challenge of putting together a delicious and nutritious multiple course vegan meal.  It's really become one of my favorite activities.  Here are a few of my recent favorites:

What do you ladies like to cook when you show off?  What are some of your favorite recipes?  Do you cook-by-the-book

And if anyone wants a recipe for any of the above

**EDIT** Adding some recipes per request!

**1.** Acorn squash is one of my favorite things to make because it's so tasty and so easy, drizzle or spray some olive oil on it, add salt and lotsa black pepper, then throw it in the oven at 350 until the skin starts to crinkle a little and the top browns a bit.  (Eat the skin, it's got loads of vitamins and the texture isn't as weird as you think)
For the brussel sprouts, add the shaved brussel sprouts (time consuming, but worth it for the recipe) to all the rendered fat and cook it down.  Once cooked down a bit, add some Grey Poupon mustard and pepper, and a teeny bit of balsamic for sweetness.  (This method works wonders with kale or collard greens as well!)

**2.** Make some refried beans first.  I usually use black beans, add salt, pepper, chipotle powder, chopped onion and jalapeno, and cumin, let the flavors come together for a while.  dump it into a big, fresh red onion, and put the burrito in seam-side down so that it closes itself.  fry it up until desires crunchiness

**3.** This was a blizzard meal my friends and I made last winter, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, and an onion.  The tofu and skirt steak we marinated in plum sauce and baked at 350 until we were happy with it (skirt steak was a little over-done, so I have no time to give.)  The mushrooms we marinated in soy sauce and baked for about 10 minutes, and we cooke some black rice noodles from the japanese section of our grocery store.  then we just cut everything into chopstick-manageable sizes, and had a giant ladle for the broth.  delicious!

**4.**  (this is the easiest thing to make ever)  sautee the kale and red onion in a pan on high while you pop the meatless meatballs (I use Trader Joe's brand) into the toaster (it gives them a nice crunch and helps them to hold their shape).  rinse the yam noodles ( (check them out, and delicious!  but have a fishy smell right out of the packaging).  open a small can of sodium-free tomato sauce (I use store-brand), throw it in a bowl, then microwave it for a minute.  add the noodles and some oregano, chopped garlic, basil, whatever you want, mix

EDIT 2: Thank you for all the comments! I tried to respond to each one constructively. Here are the general answers:
* Women come in different shapes and sizes (durrrr!)

* Women's sizes are inconsistent due to ""vanity sizing"" or just stupid systems

* A lot of women feel ashamed of their bodies or are not satisfied with their weight/shape (at least in the changerooms.

* Changeroom attendants can/should do a better job making sure women feel welcome

* The mirrors and lighting in the changerooms are unflattering most of the time

* Women of all shapes and sizes find it challenging to find clothes that fit well

* Having others around may not make it easier to go shopping

Hey ladies.

So

I was dancing, faster and faster, and then this feeling of panic and falling and then nothing. Nothing until I woke up around 5 at the hospital.

One of my friends was with me at the club. I later learned that he waited all night at the hospital but they would not tell me (they thought he might have been the one responsible for what happened). 

I spent all weekend not being able to eat (I bit my tongue pretty hard) and feeling disoriented and paranoid. I have a few flashbacks (the shapes and colors, waiting for a cab… each flashback only a couple of seconds each) and now my brain is trying to fill the blanks with false memories. And it’s really panicking. 

I don’t really know how to deal with that and I thought maybe some of you might have some advice.

I was pretty lucky. I fell on the dance floor and hurt myself a little bit

- Skinny women: Do you feel you have to eat more in public to show you're not anorexic or anything of that nature. 

- Not as skinny women: Do you feel you have to eat less in public so people don't think of you as being unhealthy.

I mean no offense by this at all.  I am just curious if you feel pressure when you have to eat in public (family dinners, etc.)

I went out to listen to some country music and there was a girl there that was with a guy. She gave me a look or two but I thought maybe it was weird to her that a black guy was in a country music bar.

The guy she was with was clearly drunnnnnnnk and she looked annoyed. I saw them kiss a few times and  It seemed that he had bought them drinks but his extreme drunkenness turned her off. After a bit the guy stumbles away and then another guy

I let her fall into my arms and lay her head on my chest. The older guy looks at me and then just walks off.  The other guy from before comes over but she just ignores him and then he leaves. The girl and I start talking and then talking turns to dancing and dancing turns to her asking me for a kiss. Having seen her kiss that other dude earlier in the night

We catch a cab to her place and make out more. She throws me on the bed and gets on top of me but then stops herself saying if this goes further she won't wake up in time for work. I agree because honestly I had to be at work too.  I ask for some water and we go in the kitchen and talk more. 

After we finish the water

But when I contact her

**Considering this type of thing happened to me the week prior and a month before that, we exchange numbers, most of the time I don't ask for the number because I know girls give them out to be nice or not hurt the guys ego when asked....and yet despite the number exchange being their idea they still  don't answer when I contact them. 

**What's the deal? What can I do different?** I try to have genuine conversations

I guess what further confuses me is the extra effort,False,,t5_2rxrw,False,,,t3_11b9k4
