1366745395.0,1cyey6,[Hiring] OOP experienced dev (C++/C#/Java); can work from home; corp and indie projects; small team; Android/iOS/SQL knowledge a plus,ShortFuse,52,8,15,"Okay

**Background:**

I run a small business which is more corporate and I also have a lot of indie develop stuff (like Fusion) which is for general public. There will be annoying corp stuff that I might ask you to help me with like build an SQL query for a report. Then there's the more exciting things that like reverse engineering Skype or something. 

I currently have a lot of projects that I need help with. Fusion can use a second coder and I have secret projects that need to be cleaned up and finished to be made public.

**Pay:**

The corp stuff I'm looking at $20-$40/hr working from home. I don't like paying per hour because if you can something great in an hour, and how well it's done. We can probably agree of a set price for certain tasks. We can set something up like a fixed weekly rate and per incident, but again, it depends on those 3 factors listed before.

The independent stuff would probably be per project/gig split of the profit.

I just want to confirm, so no pay."" You will work for me on projects both corp and indie.

**Requirements:**

* *Familiarity with OOP coding.* Syntax isn't important if you come from a Java, Javascript background. As long as you understand objects, methods, classes, variables, etc we can build stuff. A lot of my projects will branch to different platforms.

* *Enjoy coding.* This is actually a must. I'm interesting in super-projects that change/affect people's lives. Sometimes you won't see the fruit of your labor until weeks of foundation coding. If you don't like to code

* *Speak

* *Willing to learn.* It's very probable you won't know everything I would like you to know and I don't expect it. Because of this, programming styles, etc. Ideally, I would like somebody to be able to learn a new language for the sake of project if needed. (IE, if you never used JSON before but know XML, you're probably going to have learn JSON regardless)

**Perks:** (not required)

* *Live in NYC area.* Most of my corp side clients of are in the Tri-State area. Also sometimes

* *Speak, a lot of a my clients don't speak English well or will communicate with us in Spanish.

* *SQL experience.* It's not major

* *iOS dev experience.* I have never written code for an iOS, I'll eventually learn it.

* *Android dev experience.* Not really that important if you have OOP experience

* *HTML/CSS experience.* I just started learning HTML/CSS/JS

* *Creative vision.* This might sound a little off-putting

* *Social media marketing knowledge.* Twitter, etc. Not too important, but can help when planning out projects.


**Objective:**

I want to surround myself with smart people with different strengths. I am a jack of all trades. I just need secondary coders (this position) to help me complete projects faster. The idea create new solutions and experiences that revolution the way they live their lives. Yes

**Contact:**

If you're interested or have any questions about this, you're not cutting edge enough. (Seriously, no reddit account?)

Thanks for reading this far!

I work here as a software engineer (I don't manage anyone) and think it's a great job to have and an awesome team to work on! We are looking for more talented and smart people to join our team so I'm trying to help in that effort. This isn't going to be fancy because I'm not HR or a hiring manager so

**JOB DESCRIPTION**

I won't bore you with a list of technologies you should know or experience you should have - I'll just tell you what we do and how we do it and let you decide if you'd be a good fit or not. What's cool about working here is that we're usually pretty quick to upgrade to the latest technology so you won't have to worry about your skills rotting on old tech here.

**WHAT WE DO**

* We build both desktop AND web applications to help manage and monitor data center environments - here's what we use to do it:

* We use MS SQL Server 2008 R2 (probably be on 2012 by the end of the year if it releases on time) - we have a couple of dedicated DBA-types on our team but everyone knows their way around a database and can write SQL pretty well.

* Our software is built using Microsoft development tools &amp; platforms but it runs on all kinds of devices (iPad

* We have apps built in WPF, Entity Framework, KnockoutJS, jQuery, jQuery Mobile, JSON, Windows Forms

* We code in C#

* We use OnTime 2011 (from Axosoft) to manage our releases and the defects/features they include.

* We use Subversion for source control.

* At least a few of us are redditors! (that I know of - maybe a couple others are lurkers that I don't know about). We even made a new Scumbag Steve meme image out of something a co-worker did a couple of weeks ago. Yeah...we know how to really get down and party here.

* Keep in mind that we don't expect someone applying to be an expert (or even really knowledgeable) about all the technologies I mentioned above. I only knew about half the stuff I currently use now when I started - they let me take a little time to ramp up and educate myself on a few things when I started. You should have a solid background in being able to solve problems and software development patterns/methodologies though. Learning certain libraries or tools once you're here is no biggie.

**PERKS**

* The office is based in Scottsdale

* Weekly Team Lunches (free food!)

* Membership to Lifetime Fitness (gym nearby the office)

* Frequent team building activities - race karts, etc

* Xbox and Wii hooked up to flat screens (when you want to blow off some steam or just kill some time).

* You'll get to learn the latest technologies and use great equipment &amp; software to do your job. I have 2 big flat screen monitors and a fast machine to work on.

* Oh yeah

1340985411.0,vssmx,[Hiring] Software developers of all levels (even fresh grads) around Rockland County NY,onssi_RD,5,1,3,"OnSSI's R&amp;D department is looking for smart people who get things done. We are a tech company which is growing rapidly

If any of this interests you in any way

**About the company:**

OnSSI (www.onssi.com) is a technology company focusing on the video surveillance software market. We are the #1 ranked video management software company in North America by market share

We are located in Pearl River N.Y. and pay competitively
 
**Our products (what you will be working on):**

Ocularis is a video surveillance software used by organizations large and small.  We have clients in virtually every industry and of every scale. From large distributed systems to single camera installs

With the release of our new Ocularis-X product

**Environment:**

In the R&amp;D group

The R&amp;D group has their own private space away from the hustle and bustle of sales and technical support. Developers typically arrive around 9 am and leave around 5.  I say “around” because each person is different; some like to come in closer to 8 and some closer to 10. 

The dress code is casual

Every developer gets to work on new stuff, directx, and flash. Coming up we have some new features which will be adding to our WCF services and WPF controls.

We have just performed a major overhaul of our process. The developers come first. They have the last say on how long a task might take. There is no trying to squeeze a 5 day task into 2 days. On average our daily standup lasts 9 minutes. We are also in the process of increasing our iteration frequency to better serve our customers.

Every developer is empowered to take control. Each one of them can come to the rest of the group and teach us all something new. We’ve begun the foray into inversion of control

We score an 11 out of 12 on the Joel Test (no hall way usability yet).

**Position Responsibilities:**

The Software developer will collaborate with other developers, or develop new products. You will need to be able to effectively break down a problem into easy to solve tasks, for you or others to complete. 

A developer does more than just code, with more functionality. 

If you find issues with the code, you may be asked to research a new technique or technology which may be useful. If you bring these things up proactively, all the better. 

Once a year

**Requirements Include:**

* Clear communicator (written and verbal) -- to ensure ability to work with other developers and stakeholders.
* Creative solving of technical problems -- to ensure the resolution of bugs and addition of new features.
* Ability to think critically -- to ensure ability to come to the best solution for an issue.
* 0+ years of C# or C++ experience. (so this means you need to have been exposed to them
* Knowledge of design patters.
* Degree in CS or equivalent experience

Bonuses:

* WPF experience
* WCF experience
* Unit Testing experience
* Agile process experience
* Team leadership experience

**Note:**
A big thank you to everyone in this [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tdfnt/what_do_you_look_for_in_an_employer/) who helped refine this.  I welcome all comments and suggestions on how to make this posting more appealing.

**Edit**
I appreciate some of the resumes I've received, and know design patterns.  I cant take folks who like computers but have zero programming experience.

Specifically, but it's important that you know what you're doing as we're a young company but growing quickly and moving fast all the time so we need someone who can hit the ground running.


An Android version is planned once our iOS app has been brought in-house and is up and running. So if you're skills are mainly Android based we would still like to hear from you.



**Essential attributes:**

* Native iOS development skills and experience - to an extent a little experience can be substituted for just being some kind of latent super-genius
* Understanding that development priorities can change quickly in line with business reasons
* Ability to time manage and deliver on time
* Willingness to be involved in an exciting, a quick fix is good enough for now
* Willingness to suggest solutions to problems
* Able to join us in our Newcastle upon Tyne city centre office
* Sense of humour
* We've said native a few times but just to be clear, Trigger.io etc, but Objective-C is a completely mystery, that's not quite what we're after


**Desirable but not a 'must':**

* Android development experience, a generally skilled dev who is already iOS-experienced who has a willingness to learn this other platform until we have others dedicated to that role would be very useful
* A decent aesthetic sense - you don't need to be a designer
* Experience with Testflight for deploying development versions of apps
* Experience with apps to the various distribution channels


**Salary**

Negotiable based on experience but it shouldn't disappoint.


This is a permanent

[Link to resume](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5QW-In6_PoLTFpycE5JcmQ0QWM/edit?usp=sharing)

Hello r/jobbit. I'm graduating college in late May, but honestly I'd be happy with anything in the country.

Quick overview of my experience: I've spent two years working as support for both staff and students at my university. This current year is being spent as a supervisor of that helpdesk. I've done both phone support as well as face to face and onsite support, and don't anticipate any problems with passing it.

Here's my one major issue - I'm a US citizen, and as soon as I have a written job offer I can submit them to the Canadian government (average processing time as of this post: 49 days).

Worked as an consultant/freelancer for the last several years but ideally would like long-term employment so I can invest myself more into projects then a ""get it done as quickly and as stable as possible.""

Basic stats:
=======

 * 10+ years working experience with PHP5
 * 10+ years working with JS intensive environments ( ExtJS
 * 10+ years of intermittent work with Java ( I know the syntax fairly well but never invested much time in the common libraries )
 * Initial background in c/c++
 * ~5+ years experience with Rails/Ruby +
 * 1 year iOS development experience 
 * Cursory experience with Android dev.

Python specific experience
=================

 * Mid-level to senior authority with Django 1.4 ( hosted via uWSGI though nginx )
 * Twisted web and understanding of the Zope component system.
 * Used Fabric


Some fun past projects
===============

 * Built a semi-massive pre-big data ETL system to harvest Real estate data from dozens of MLS's across the country using pyRETS
 * Built out a small 3TB
 * Built a prototype mass MMS platform where client's would see a specific asset code
 * Worked on a platform that handles 6 billion HTTP trx's a month ( potentially 10x more traffic then reddit handles ).

I need 2 customization created :

1)What I am looking for is a grid view

That way I can very easily link a client to a day and chose the service they received. Once i fill this 'matrix' out it would generate all my invoices and send them out to each client.

The list of active clients should be editable against a table of all my clients

I should also be able to flag any client such that when generating and sending a flagged clients invoice will popup and allow me to modify it as required.

2)I would like to purchase NFC tags, this should pop up a quick menu in an app which says the dogs info and lets the walker very simply select the service the dog is receiving that day. Simple clean efficient. This selection would then automatically pop up in the matrix I described above, automating the invoicing process. If for some reason the phone is out of service or fails to send to the server it should cache these scans and selections locally and notify the walker they need to resend them. I would also need a method to add new blank tags to the system by writing them and then tying them to a new client.

We’re a completely distributed team, with members all over North America so you can happily work in your underwear and we don’t care. We’re flexible about when you work and how much you work, and we don’t believe in tight deadlines or having our employees kill themselves to make us happy. If you have to do that, someone is not doing their job properly. We also don’t keep it too serious.

If any of this interests you in any way

**About the company:**

OnSSI (www.onssi.com) is a technology company focusing on the video surveillance software market. We are the #1 ranked video management software company in North America by market share

We are located in Pearl River N.Y. and pay competitively, plus additional personal, sick, and flex time.
 
**Our products (what you will be working on):**

Ocularis is a video surveillance software used by organizations large and small.  We have clients in virtually every industry and of every scale. From large distributed systems to single camera installs

With the release of our new Ocularis-X product

**Environment:**

In the R&amp;D group

The R&amp;D group has their own private space away from the hustle and bustle of sales and technical support. Developers typically arrive around 9 am and leave around 5.  I say “around” because each person is different; some like to come in closer to 8 and some closer to 10. 

The dress code is casual

Every developer gets to work on new stuff, directx, and flash. Coming up we have some new features which will be adding to our WCF services and WPF controls.

We have just performed a major overhaul of our process. The developers come first. They have the last say on how long a task might take. There is no trying to squeeze a 5 day task into 2 days. On average our daily standup lasts 9 minutes. We are also in the process of increasing our iteration frequency to better serve our customers.

Every developer is empowered to take control. Each one of them can come to the rest of the group and teach us all something new. We’ve begun the foray into inversion of control

We are on our way to conforming to all 12 tenants of the Joel test.

**Position Responsibilities:**

The Software developer will collaborate with other developers, or develop new products. You will need to be able to effectively break down a problem into easy to solve tasks, for you or others to complete. 

A developer does more than just code, with more functionality. 

If you find issues with the code, you may be asked to research a new technique or technology which may be useful. If you bring these things up proactively, all the better. 

Once a year

**Requirements Include:**

* Clear communicator (written and verbal) -- to ensure ability to work with other developers and stakeholders.
* Creative solving of technical problems -- to ensure the resolution of bugs and addition of new features.
* Ability to think critically -- to ensure ability to come to the best solution for an issue.
* 0+ years of C# or C++ experience. (so this means you need to have been exposed to them
* Knowledge of design patters.
* Degree in CS or equivalent experience

Bonuses:

* WPF experience
* WCF experience
* Unit Testing experience
* Agile process experience
* Team leadership experience

**Note:**
A big thank you to everyone in this [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tdfnt/what_do_you_look_for_in_an_employer/) who helped refine this.  I welcome all comments and suggestions on how to make this posting more appealing.

I will pay you $25 via paypal (or send you a game through Steam if that's your thing--from the list of what I currently have available) for posting 40 or more flyers throughout your campus in the fall. You don't have to post all the flyers at once, though most schools offer at least some amount of free printing so if you aren't sure whether yours does or not, ask around.

You will also get 10% from any essay that comes in from your campus. I create unique discount codes for each campus so that I can track where submissions are coming from.

Salesforce.com has one of the best Information Security teams in the world and growing this piece of the business is a top priority! Our Information Security teams work hand in hand with the business to ensure the highest security around all of our applications. With our focus on Trust
On a daily basis, read log files for hidden treasures, and investigate compromised hosts. Our researchers will also participate within various security communities as active contributors not only for the benefit of Salesforce.com, but for the benefit of the Internet as a whole.
&lt;/management speak&gt;
No overloaded
Required skills:
Reverse malware in your sleep, spinning a story of the compromise from exploitation to persistence. You didn’t write Volatility (or maybe you did!), but you could write a book on how to use it. Packers, debugger detection, and other tricks are speedbumps for others, but don’t even give you a second thought. Others curl up with a great book, you curl up with logs for a good read to help you sleep at night. Another operating system? You helped beta test it. You know it already. Network packet ninja, but collecting exploit kits is much cooler. Even cooler is fingerprinting them as they pop up and recognizing they’re using the latest Java exploit. Criminals and malware authors can’t hide their fingerprints from your Google-fu. You developed Indicators of Compromise before the term was coined. Blogging is something you do
Ideally, so you’ve built your tools, and tools for others. Salesforce.com, Force.com, or Heroku development experience (hey, we like our own Champagne).

Overview: I am looking to have a app created that takes guitar TABS and plays them back visually on a screen. A user would log into their interface and upload a TAB that they have downloaded or the software would find the tab from a URL provided. For example a user would look at this tab (http://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/m/metallica/nothing_else_matters_intro_tab.htm) and it would show visually how to play the song in the UI.

Once the tab has loaded the UI would show a guitar that demonstrates where the tab is being played step by step.

How Tabs Work: A guitar tab is a set of text instructions that shows you how to play a song step by step on a guitar. Every tab has a designated holding position and place to strum on a guitar. I can show you in greater detail how this works.

I work at British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and my group
You can view the full job description here: http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/employment/vacancies/job.php?JobID=850

You'd be working in a very small team that is responsible for internal and external facing web services. We support a wide variety of systems. We work with linux based systems for all external websites and all scientific areas and with Microsoft SharePoint for our internal intranet.

Our external websites are primarily coded in PHP using MySQL and Oracle for the backends.

You will be the primary person for supporting our business systems and Sharepoint intranet. As we are a small team this generally means you'll be contributing to all and the other members will be as well but you'll be the point-of-contact and leader for your projects.

Here's an example of some of the kinds of systems you'd help support and develop:

* Sharepoint based intranet - general content and integrating external data sources
* PHP/mysql travel database - tracking employee movements to the Antarctic
* Business Management Tools for tracking business goals - dashboard style systems
* Public facing websites include wordpress - www.antarctica.ac.uk
* Photo database - http://www.photo.antarctica.ac.uk

As needed it could also involve more scientific oriented systems:

* Web mapping systems using Geoserver
* Scientific metadata and data systems - http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/dms/

As these have grown up in time and were initially developed by different teams you may need to be comfortable in multiple languages. Some are PHP or Perl and obviously sharepoint is none of these. We don't realistically expect you to be able to do everything right away but being good and one with the ability to learn to work in other areas would be perfect. 

I know that asking for a sharepoint and lamp web systems person may be a tall order but if you're really comfortable with sharepoint then learning enough to support the other systems should be well within your grasp. And vice versa. 

The job is based in Cambridge
The pay range is £26, this is not a lot for this kind of work and you'll have a pretty good chance of starting at the top of the band. I know this isn't a very competetive salary but we do have very generous working conditions. There are 30 days annual leave and also 10.5 bank and privilege holidays. We work on a 37 hour work week that has a flexi system. If you want to work four 12 hour days and take a 3 day weekend you can.

This is a scientific institute that is funded by the UK government and other scientific grants and has been the subject of a pay freeze for many years now. We're a good team with some good people and we do care about the work we do. You'll get to work on varied projects and help contribute to the overall direction of web systems at BAS. 

Frankly I know we're asking a ridiculously low amount of money but that's the reality of publicly funded research institutions. The upside is it's an amazing place to work and we'll arrange it so you can hang out with a sea spider or eat a piece of 10

I'm one of the lowly underpaid team members and it took three years but I eventually got to some computer stuff in weird places:

* I work in Illustrator (vector) so your logo will be completely scaleable and printable. Also you get .AI / .EPS and .PNG and .JPG and .PSD (layered) of the final logo

* You pay **after** I design the perfect logo for you but before I send you the source files

* Payment methods: PayPal, or if you want to ask about something else - drop me a PM

You can use a modded version of wordpress

Here's what I need:

* The entire initial set up of the CMS itself
* All comics (GSC) up to present added (storyline only. Use current GSC for guidance)



The CMS must have the following features:

* First comic ever, previous button navigation
* first comic of previous 'chapter' (see [gaia newsroom](http://www.gaiaonline.com/newsroom/)'s updates. Each thumb is a 'chapter')

* date comic page premiered on Gaia (I'm not expecting you to find this info. When you make the CMS
* Comic page # of # (of current 'chapter')
* Comic page # (of total comic pages in GSC)
* Special features/considerations for particular pages (namely [Xmas 2k4](http://thegcw.com/wordpress/?p=15) and [MMVII](http://thegcw.com/wordpress/?p=409))
* All content is loaded in an encapsulating table
* content inside said div/table/iframe is centered and uses fluid/liquid margins
*  New chapters/pages/comics easily uploaded/updated by myself without further assistance (A GUI would be nice in that).



If you look at http://gsc.thegcw.com

I will probably change the site's layout if this project ever gets off the ground. You don't need to design a layout

thegcw.com is a fansite to gaiaonline.com. All my website is, I'll take it down... For the time being though, this site is just my baby and I unfortunately don't have time to redo it myself; so I'm paying someone else to.

Dear the Internets

We are an unusual design firm: we are very a multidisciplinary, visual design, and experimental projects. We spend most of our time creating non-profit ventures for community and personal value and spend the rest of our time dreaming up and building innovative concepts for commercial clients.

A recent web-app concept has just been green-lit by a local client and we would like to work with a Boston-based freelancer, and manage the web-app build-out (next several months). 

We are looking for:
-web stuff: javascript/jquery, [other bonus goodies you might have], and a good eye for design
-stuff the cool kids are doing: software architecture chops


The firm's founders are MIT CSAIL (Ph.D.) and MIT Media Lab alums and have expanded the firm to an awesome group of collaborators and interns.
We did this (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkYfB1C0Zgc) viral video for OK Go, production, and software for Showtime, Discovery, Samsung, MTV, and others.

Right off the Central Square T stop (20 feet away!)

It's good times - PM me or tell your friends!
SIGNING/REFERRAL BONUS: If you or your friend interviews for (and is selected for) this freelance job on Sunday (today)

I say partner because, we'll both be working on hope.  This is not some ""once we reach this threshold I'll start paying you"" scheme, however; **you will start making money from the time of our first sale, and sales permitting you will be compensated for all initial work, not just work that takes place after the money-making begins**.  I know these deals are a dime a dozen and that a developer's work is often undervalued, and this is not my intention, I simply don't have the several thousand dollars you ought to get paid.  We can discuss the percentage of sales/profits you want and other details once you know a bit more about the company, workload

The sites will be fairly basic in setup and I will take care of all written content.  Marketing and all customer services aspects of the company will also be taken care of by me and a few freelancers (non-programming) I already have lined up.  If we start making money at the levels I'm hoping to

Given the fact that I can't pay upfront, sixty years old and starting a second career--if you possess the necessary knowledge and skills and are willing to put in the work, awesome.  If you don't possess the necessary knowledge and skills, we'll both know pretty quickly.

The only other requirements are that you are 18 and legally employable in the United States.  I am incorporated in Washington State and you will be signing either a freelancer or a limited partnership contract (no liability with a buy-out clause) once we agree on a payment arrangement/work to be completed.
