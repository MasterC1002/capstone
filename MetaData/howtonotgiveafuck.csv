That should be everyone

Eat a fucking apple. 

No I'm not kidding. Go. Go now. Go to the nearest place where there's apples and get one. Eat it. 

Watch this shit.

**IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A FUCK WHILE EATING AN APPLE**

I'm not kidding here. How do you eat an apple? You just fucking bite it. Where? Who the fuck cares where. You know where to bite. In the APPLE part. You chomp the fuck into that apple and you rip it the fuck apart.

Look at yourself. You're a god damned bad ass. The number of fucks you give is decreasing rapidly. 

Go for a walk. Apple in hand. Who looks at you? People? What do they think of you? Not a god damned thing. You're a dude eating an apple. Look at how you're standing. You're fucking chill. You know what? Strut. Strut like a pimp with an apple in your hand. Doesn't that feel good? No one cares. You're just a dude with an apple. You can fucking strut if you want to

You didn't have to peel shit. You didn't have to cook shit. You didn't have to do SHIT to enjoy this apple. All you did is grab it and comp like a fucking boss. How much are you going to eat? WHO THE FUCK CARES! You can chuck it after 4 bites or you could eat everything but the seeds and stem (seriously

Try it. Go now. Quit reading Reddit and go eat an apple. Tell me you gave a fuck while you were eating that apple. You didn't. You felt like a boss. That's fucking science.

Don't take their garbage and spread it to other people at work

I've been doing a lot of thinking lately and decided to compile all my realizations into a list to remind myself of these things every day. They're pretty much the mantras I use to help me cope with daily life. Just thought they might help someone else out too :)

1. IMPENDING DEATH: Think about the imminence of death. Nothing really matters. Time is the most precious commodity. Focus on the most important things. 


2. PERSPECTIVE: Think about how lucky you are to be in this instance of the universe, to be in this moment. 


3. PRESENCE: Remember that there is only now. Be aware of it


4. AWARENESS: Be aware of your emotions and thoughts and recognize how your AWARENESS is separate.

 
5. HUMOUR: Remember to laugh. Take the humorous route. Don't take things too seriously. 


6. SELF-ASSUREDNESS: Remember that you know yourself


7. EGO: Take nothing personally. Recognize your ego. Remember the seven deadly sins. Realize your insignificance in the universe. Forget the need to feel special. Stop identifying with labels. Stop seeking approval. Ask if your negative comments or actions are coming from a place of fear and anger. 


8. PATIENCE: Recognize that everyone and everything is created and driven by the universe and what happened previously. Realize this is what is. Remember the child self and the higher order thinking self. Be patient with people and yourself. Realize that you can't always know now. Realize that you can't control ignorant opinions and they are not personal. 


9. OUTROSPECTION: Look outwards. Listen. Watch people. Learn about them. Ask them questions. (this might mean turning the focus of an argument onto them - i have trouble with this)


10. ACCEPTANCE: This life was not made to happen in your favour


11. BALANCE: Pursue moderation and maintenance in every aspect of life. Take care of yourself. 


12. WILLPOWER: Recognize that your will is incredibly powerful. Just DO IT.  


13. ENERGY: Put out good energy into the world. Try to reduce suffering. Don't forget to do what you love and do what feels good.

It wasn't really love at first sight, and hooking up. Lately we've settled into best friends for an extended period of time but my feelings for her haven't diminished a bit. We're completely open with each other about the state of my feelings and things of that nature


I am better than stooping to the level of trying to change what someone wants.

I am better than trying desperately to convince someone they love me. I am better than trying to convince myself someone loves me.

I do not need to subject myself to constant

So today I will stop.

I will stop thinking ""how can I make Lauren love me today?""

I will stop believing every touch or smile or look means she has finally ""come to her senses.""

I will stop allowing her to cuddle with me because she is cold when that cuddling means something completely different to me. 

I will stop judging myself through the lens of unrequited love.

Her feelings towards me do not reflect my character whatsoever. Her feelings towards me do not reflect her character whatsoever. 

They reflect only her desires

I will stop trying to shape her desires to include me

I will stop allowing myself to become angry that she does not love me. This includes anger towards God/The universe, anger towards myself.

I will stop giving a fuck that Lauren does not love me.

And I will go find someone who does.

1. **Love yourself** a.k.a. learn to accept yourself for what you are. You are the one and only person that you have to spend your entire life with, who can? You are great. You are awesome. Don't let others opinions get in the way of what you think about yourself.

2. **Stop judging others** once you love yourself

3. **Stop worrying about what other people think about you** remember when all you did was worry about others opinions? Well that's exactly how everyone else is. They are too busy worrying about what everyone else thinks, they aren't important to you. Your dad? how is he stopping you from doing whatever you want. HE ISN'T! Get it out of your head that other people stand in your way. THEY DON'T! Seriously, the only opinion that affects your life, is YOURS. Bottom line for this one WHO CARES WHAT PEOPLE THINK. I cannot stress that enough. It's something you'll have to learn on your own though... that no matter what people think about you, you can still do whatever you want to do.

4. **Be a decent person** This step really isn't necessary, and treat them like you would treat yourself. This may also be the hardest step by the way... but you can do it.

I think that's it... if I think of any more I will come back for an edit... if someone would like to add

**EDIT**: I did think of something else to add... 

**Remember that you can't please everyone**. Yes, or be happy for you. Stop trying to make other people's life's better. You'll never succeed. Instead, focus on making your life better, and making yourself happy. *TIP*: Happiness is a choice. Now that you know that, every time you are sad, you are doing it on purpose. You choose to be happy from now on. And don't give yourself some BS excuse about clinical depression... I battled through depression, and I now go everywhere with the motherfuckingest big smile on my face. I smile because I enjoy being happy.

1346072177.0,ywgbw,4 Months of Teaching Myself How to Not Give a Fuck Comes Down to This,knowacarpenter,643,108,128,"6 Months ago I gave an over abundance of fucks. 
5 Months ago I met and started dating the girl of my dreams.
4 Months ago

My downhill spiral lasted about a week. I was distraught. My cigarette consumption doubled. I gained weight. I was depressed.
But then

I honestly can't explain the reason for my sudden and dramatic change in my personal philosophy
I hadn't discovered this sub yet, my reasoning being: ""Why not""

Instead of moping around and feeling sorry for myself, while others, I'm incredibly proud of. 

Here's what I accomplished this summer:

- I began the practice of waking up every morning and looking in the mirror
- Quit Cigarettes
- Quit Dipping (I was a big fan of nicotine)
- Built an exact replica lifeguard stand in my backyard 
- Started spear fishing
- Woke up at 4am 6 days a week to run before work (I love it so much I just signed up for a half marathon)
- Trained myself to enjoy a glass of whiskey
- Randomly bought a plane ticket San Francisco (I'm from New Jersey) and made zero plans about where I would stay or what I would do while there. 
- Got a ridiculous looking Mohawk
- Stopped drinking alcohol for a month 
- Stopped trees for a month
- Deleted my Facebook
- Quit drinking soda (I would have 3 Diet Mountain Dews a day previous to this)
- Completely changed my diet 
- Started flossing and brushing my teeth twice a day (I was inconsistent at this for a long time)
- Once a week I would go to a local bar by myself
- Became more patient by forcing myself to wait for things I wanted

I have become much more proficient at not giving any fucks, and that is this girl. (no pun intended) 

In one hour I'm seeing her for the first time in 4 months. Wish me luck brothers. I know giving a fuck about her is essentially against the core beliefs of this community

P.S.

The three most important things I did this summer are smiling at myself in the morning

Smiling at yourself in the morning is absolutely incredible. Try it

Social media makes you give fucks about people you shouldn't be giving any fucks to. I would like to go into this further

When you go out to eat alone, you become more comfortable doing something by yourself, and being able to hold a conversation with random people is crucial in life. 



**EDIT:** Thanks for all the support, but I have a very good feeling about the situation, only time will tell I guess. However, Sillyminion made me realize that I don't have total control of this situation. I definitely have SOME, but in the end I cannot decide what will happen, so I'm going to approach the situation with caution, and try to focus on the things I CAN control.

Everyone's advice has been very thought provoking. I'm going to spend some time focusing on the rest of the unimportant things in my life

A user named [Mumberthrax](http://www.reddit.com/user/Mumberthrax) replied with a really mind-blowing answer; I think that it can be useful to a lot of people here


&gt;Make a conscious decision not to take anything personally.
Everyone has their own idea of what the world is, their own filtered image, or flavor or interpretation. To each one of us, everything IS the way we see it to be, regardless of what anyone else sees.
&gt;
&gt;So everyone sees the world differently
&gt;
&gt;If you pass by a stranger walking down the street and they say to you with very sour grimace, but it demonstrates the principle: each person is seeing and judging the world around them based on their personal beliefs. You have no obligation to share their model of reality.
&gt;
&gt;Whenever someone comes to you like the purple sock person does and offers a model of reality, you can either accept it and integrate it and say ""damn, he's right these socks are really revolting. I'm a terrible person for even thinking of wearing them"", or you can say ""no thanks"" and continue choosing your own way of defining reality.
&gt;
&gt;The point I'm trying to make is that when someone is judging you they are doing so not because you have any sincere reason to feel shame or guilt or embarrassment, it's about them.
&gt;
&gt;This doesn't mean you are always right and everyone who disagrees with you is always wrong. It doesn't mean you should go and commit genocide and say FU to everyone who wants you to go to prison. You're still responsible for acting in line with your morals, and self-empowerment.
&gt;
&gt;Same idea applies to positive feedback. When people say ""oh Jaja1990, too, are not really because of you. They say these things because their own model of reality causes them to. You know you are a kind person and you don't have to have someone else tell you so in order to feel good about yourself. You can agree with them and share in that appreciation of yourself, but don't fall into the trap of believing that you need validation from others. You're like two traveling strangers whose paths momentarily coincide. You can enjoy each others' company, but you aren't going on that path just because they are - you were already on it.
&gt;
&gt;One thing you could do is try to take stock of the underlying beliefs you have regarding the instances where you find yourself obsessing over others' opinions. Pull out a new journal and make it just for this project. Start writing down how you're feeling over specific circumstances, I don't mean forget them and pretend they never existed because then you're just being dishonest with yourself. I mean view them as part of a dialectic where they are one part of a synthesis with your other beliefs about being kind to yourself or being a more awesome person, and the resulting product is a more empowering belief or set of beliefs)",Advice,False,,t5_2tna8,advice,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/11xovp/and_heres_why_you_should_not_give_a_fuck_about/

I stepped up at work, and told I was well above average compared to others. I have stepped up and delegated to people in higher positions than me, as well as taking the initiative to teach people when the opportunity presents itself. You know why? FUCK IT! I can be better than everyone around me, without really trying that much harder.




You know what the major thing was that changed all this? I looked around, and the ones who were leaders, and realised that as long as I know what I am doing, I can be just as good, if not better than them, because most of them really don't know what they are doing! These are all people who looked at a situation, and thought “fuck it, even if I'm not perfect, they wouldn't fuck up as much as they do, and don't think we could do it




Guess what, then you can step up and make that situation your own. If you can talk to a person, you can talk to a girl, step up, doesn't matter if you don't know everything, fuck it! Just do it.

Not giving a fuck is a great life skill. When that asshole cuts you off on the way to work, don't give a fuck.

In essence, could also be worded as ""Don't Sweat The Small Shit."" 

I say that because of a specific reason. Sometimes, you should give a fuck. If John G comes to rape and murder your family, you should give a fuck.

Why? Because not giving a fuck when something extremely detrimental happens to you or people you care about makes you a narcissistic asshole. Because any mental health professional would state that you naturally not caring about these life changing events is extremely unhealthy. Because you have a life and should give a fuck when something out of your control significantly changes the status quo.

I'm not the founder of this idea. I'm not the most active member on this board by a longshot, I want you to know that trying to put aside that pain and not deal with it will kill you inside. 

When you've dealt with that pain for some time, we'll be here. But until then, quit running away from your problems under the guise of ""Not Giving A Fuck"" and realize that being hurt after something really bad happens to you is not only natural, but part of the healing process that cannot be skipped.

Well, you know, besides the rocking abs and beautiful general figure. What do nice guys do? Well, they put others before themselves, they need a reason **NOT** to trust someone rather than a reason **TO** trust someone, they remember birthdays and buy gifts, they loan money and tell the person they are offering the money to that they don't need to pay back, they say uplifting things to people having a bad day

* You have poor coping skills.
* You have been treated like absolute dog-shit in your life.
* You may be depressed.
* You may be/have been overweight.
* You have been in &lt;= 1 relationship that was very important.

So, led-on, taken advantage of, and suffered severe 'nice-guy-syndrome'.

What is nice-guy-syndrome? Being taken advantage of. I think this is most prevalent in M/F interactions. Friend-zoned

I think that the biggest problem for nice-guys, but don't have enough control over their mind to stop it from doing negative things like:

* Discounting positive attributes of themselves.
* Discountin the fact that they are a nice-guy.
* Taking into account other factors that may be causing problems. (Blaming themselves.)
* Internalizing emotion versus expressing it.

I think that nice-guys come to this subreddit because of the end of a relationship. That's what brought me here, how to care about yourself and distract yourself from things that you need to realize that you care about too much. I think we can all agree that one cannot simply stop giving a fuck if it is in his/her DNA. This post is to keep nice-guys nice-guys, because this subreddit, however infinitely helpful, has probably turned nice-guys into not-so-nice-guys. I'll give you an example of my own problem:

I was in a relationship that I was desperate for, and I fell back into the same manic-depressive state that I was in before the relationship, except 10x worse. I'm in therapy for that and other things, mostly gaining coping skills, and I fell that I should pass on some of the knowledge that has kept me alive to others that may need it.

A few things you need to know:

* Realize and cherish that you are a nice-guy.
* Promise yourself that you will not stop being a nice-guy.
* Learn that you are not the cause of all your problems (however
* You are a wonderful person

The relationship I went into was great, just like you did in the first relationship, because it wouldn't be fair to another girl to be treated less than the cunt that tore your heart into its molecular state.

If you start thinking about something in detail that makes you sad

* Repeat to yourself
* Tell yourself
* Tell yourself that depression is a flaw in chemistry
* Find something to busy yourself with.

You may modify any of the steps to fit you, you will think you are lying to yourself, but you will come to understand that what you are saying **IS** true, and you no longer need anyone else to say it to you to believe it. The moment to moment thing is how you need to start living. I bet that you are living in the future or living in the past, either way, you are getting depressed about something (probably) that is much smaller than you let yourself realize. You are thinking for others and how they will interact with you before you meet them, or after you distort your view on them. Stop

If you start to get angry about something

* Exercise.
* Exercise.
* Exercise.
* Exercise.

No modification to these steps are allowed, and your overall self-esteem. You will get high after each session, and you will forget your problems and continue to be as productive as you know that you can be. You will crave that high, you will achieve that high, and you will get healthy in the process.

Lastly, that cunt doesn't deserve you. If she treats you with kindness, respect, listens to your problems, helps you as much as you help her, tries to help others on a regular basis, and sees eye to eye with you on every make-or-break you have in a relationship, and you should give her the chance to **PROVE** she deserves you. The same goes with anyone else. If you meet a guy, etc.) they must prove themselves to you by being better than others around them, it is always wonderful to meet people with flaws

Now, you will feel better than if you treat someone like shit. *However*, do not expect anything from being a nice guy. Treat everyone exactly they way you want to be treated (save for romantically), but do not expect anything from it. Don't expect some kind of reward from that person. Do not expect a reward for being a nice guy. Do not expect to change anyone's life. You may save a life, you may piss someone off for being a nice-guy, you may help someone, you may not. Helping someone is really about getting him/her to help him/herself. Let them know that the world isn't completely full of douchebags that don't care about them at all, but a hardcore motherfucker underneath that can fight off an army of mountain lions while feeding the birds and tending to the flowers. You are a wonderful person, I hope you learn that you are the only person worth GAF about for a while

**Don’t bring up people’s short-comings. Period.** This sounds like a “duh” thing, do the opposite, compliment them. It’s fuckin’ weird, but when you make someone else feel good about themselves, you automatically feel really good about yourself.

we get to the next bar, and laugh at each other's jokes. barkeep tells us it's closing time so we finish our drinks and ask what the ladies are doing next. they say they're going home as we step out of the bar. taxi rolls up and the ladies get in. to our surprise, they invite us! wasn't even in our agenda. feels good, man. we get to their place, they forgot their keys inside so my friend jumps in the bathroom window and unlocks the front door. we go inside and have a good time talking about random stuff and BAM. my friend is in the bedroom with one girl and i'm on the couch with the other. feels great, man. we left their apt at 5am and went to dennys. he had country fried steak and i ordered a lumberjack slam. we didn't know what to think! flippin awesome night!

*I'd like to give a nod to all you guys individually but again

I see a lot of people with problems, So ill just do this instead. Now, I am not going to follow suit, give an inspiring rant with copious use of the word fuck, and try to rally the masses as others have successfully done. I don't think I really need to because for some people, this shit just works.

**A quick backstory

Back in high school I was more or less a social retard. I had a veritable silo of fucks devoted to the fact that I couldn't level with the people I wanted to know, knowing that I would rather not feel like shit about something so stupid, gave me a friendly shove in the right direction by signing my scrawny ass up for football, and then totally ignoring my protests (well, this among other things). Yes, parts of it sucked, no, and in doing so I learned how to stop caring what the jackasses thought

**No fucks he says?!**

Why yes, Ill be honest here, something that sounds vaguely akin to a mild self induced psychosis. More on that later.

You know that feeling you get when you are about to give a fuck? that feeling in your chest and gut region? or that sort of anxious squirm? Maybe you need to poop. I don't know. Its usually something unavoidable that you have to go through. Like that awkward 20 second period where you and another person on the sidewalk are walking directly at each other, its been sucked into the intake of a jet turbine who's exhaust is pointed at your face.

**This is the part where I may say fuck a lot.**

As soon as you notice that familiar feeling, work on making yourself believe that you are fucking awesome at this. Try to let go of a bit of your useless feelings of limitation and doubt and just think ""I got this. Because I rock this shit""

Walking down the road and have that awkward moment? NOPE. Fucking make eye contact

Gotta do something public that you are thinking about ditching? NO YOU FUCK, scream it in your head if you need to drown out the thoughts of ""I wonder what that person is going to think abou--"" who fuckin cares dude, you had no other options and therefore that persons opinion is irrelevant.

Asshole at work? He probably has to break others down just to build himself up

Ex making your life hard? Feeling down about that break up? Well fuck, but fuckin keep telling yourself that. After all, your now on your journey to being a honey badger. You know what women who aren't your batshit insane ex are in to? fuckin honey badgers. Go get em'.

An awkward moment with the girl who has jedi like powers over your dangly parts? Well guess what motherfucker

**...Da fuq?**

Yes. In your mind, but the point isnt to be totally convincing, its to form a habit by conscious thought and repetition. The more you do it, the easier it is, and after a while, you don't have to try any more. When you are at the point where you can cast off the fucks you give when you need to, guess what? you no longer have any actual fucks, then you actually are just at ease with yourself. Habit by repetition

The professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles roll

I want to clear up a little confusion that a lot of people seem to have. Not giving a fuck is NOT about APATHY. It's about ACCEPTANCE. There is a huge difference between the two. 

Apathy is simply the refusal to care. If we are apathetic about everything

Acceptance is the refusal of the urge to change something. Instead of saying ""I'm late for work. Whatever, but I can assure you, there is a difference. When you accept things as they are, a few things happen: 

* you stop trying to change the world. Not in the ""feed the homeless"" sense, traffic, and gravity. 
* when you stop trying to change things, the music on the radio, and accept that you will be moving slowly, you appreciate the moment more, and stress less 
* when you see things as they are, you appreciate that it is a flower. It is hard to put into words, but acceptance of things leads to appreciation of them. 

And all of this ties into compassion. We exist as the universe, and let them be who they are, they are kinder to you, and you start to see beauty in everyone. Accept people, things, and the world for what it is, without trying to change it, it is inevitable that the world is going to win

What this all boils down to is this: stop trying to change the world, a sense of connectedness with everything, a sense of compassion, and a larger appreciation for the life you have been given.

1372899095.0,1hlrw6,5 movies that teach you about not giving a fuck. plus description,basedgodjeff,393,77,125,"Fight Club:

This movie is about a guy who cares too much about material possesions and somehow he joins this fight club that helps him to feel free and to not give a fuck about the meaningless things in life. Fighting helped him express energy and feel more powerful and strong enough to handle life.

Matrix:

I'm sure everyone has seen it but the not giving a fuck in this movie comes from Neo

American Beauty:

I just saw this movie for the first time today and I can honestly say it is one of my favorite movies by far. Its about a man that finally decides to change his ordinary life pattern and do things that make him happy instead of living life by rules set up by society. The things he does makes him seem different but he enjoys himself and he learns that is the best way to live. by not giving a fuck. 

Yes Man:

This is another one of my favorites its a movie where the main character Jim Carrey gets advice from a friend to stop saying no to all the oppurtunities in his life and just go after what he wants. Saying yes to new things helped him to realize the importance of not giving a fuck about taking chances in life because of the benefits you will recieve.

Office Space:

This movie is about a man stuck in an everyday job that finally decides to change his life and do what he wants. He says what he wants

Please check them out. The essential message I got from all of these movies was basically to stop living a routine life. Stop going through life caring about whats going to happen next because whatever is going to happen in life IS GOING TO HAPPEN WHETHER YOU WANT IT TO OR NOT. Stop giving a fuck and just live life. I know its hard because I still struggle but just keep moving forward.

1373066656.0,1hpwlr,"RE: Rules, Fuck Givings, and Relationships",bikewithoutafish,366,30, it's not like that. We aren't angry

Let's take a gander at this subreddit real quick. Check out that sidebar. Mmm. Look at that fucking header. Classy. You see that title? ""how to not give a fuck"". Poetry. 

Notice how it doesn't say ""fix my life for me"" or ""make me feel better"" or ""solve my problems because I don't know how""? There's a reason for that.

This isn't /r/relationship_advice or /r/mmfb . The point of this subreddit isn't to make you cheer up. 

Let's take a tangent here. It's important; I promise. 

It isn't our job to fix your life. ""But bikewithoutafish, yes and no. See, the thing is, this is your life. Yours. You, my sweet little angel, have been given a wonderful gift of being able to be alive, to feel, to hate

If you aren't mature enough to make an effort to control your life

Now

BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, is to post about it online to get our sagely wisdom, there is an underlying issue with you. You're not giving right fucks.

See, namely ""Right speech, explained in negative terms, means avoiding four types of harmful speech: lies (words spoken with the intent of misrepresenting the truth); divisive speech (spoken with the intent of creating rifts between people); harsh speech (spoken with the intent of hurting another person's feelings); and idle chatter (spoken with no purposeful intent at all)."" (http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/speech.html)

Notice this doesn't say ""Don't ever talk, it basically boils down to ""Don't be an asshole. Say what you mean, mean what you say. Use common sense. Don't lie"".

Giving fucks is like the ninth part of the path. Give right fucks. That's what we mean when we say to not give a fuck. If you gave literally no fucks you would be a heroin junkie or a protozoan ooze that never leaves your couch. That's not a good life.

But on the other hand

YOU have to make an effort to better yourself. 
YOU are responsible for your own life. 
YOU have to be prepared to learn

And

WE have to be prepared to help those who will help themselves;  
WE have to be able to give advice on matters
WE have to be dedicated to creating a community in which discussion and wisdom can flourish

So

Henceforth

To my shock I saw that one of my all time favourite designers was on the list (it was a small list

I spent the day moping / anxious I guess because I couldn't think of an excuse to get out of having to go. I knew I had to. For an hour I was just psyching myself up, I waited 10minutes outside playing on my phone before I went in. It was as bad as I thought it would be. I felt like every single person was looking at me, wondering what I was doing there. When I finally found the girl I knew she barely said hi, she was completely wasted and sitting on her boyfriend's lap. I asked for directions to the bathroom, which I planned to use and then leave. That's when I had my big moment, I decided I wasn't going to start 2013 by being a little bitch. I decided to see not knowing anyone as a good thing. I poured myself a drink and walked over to a group of people and introduced myself ( this probably doesn't seem like a big deal to someone without social anxiety) I honestly was past giving a fuck about what anyone thought of me. I must have met 10 people before I saw my target, the designer. I walked straight up to him and shook his hand - said ""Dude, about design, gave me a business card and told me I should visit their studio this week and that we should all go for a drink after.

Today I went for a walk in the forest, except when traversing the bridge over the creek, floating in midair over glitter trickles. I sat down on a bench for a smoke. After a few minutes, an old man comes around the bend. All you can hear is the weak drawl of midday insects and the sound of him crunching closer. 

""Mind if I share that bench with you?"" He says. ""No problem, maybe 70s, but he's classy, wearing slacks and a hat. Just to go for a walk in the forest, lol. And he asks me a couple questions, and we can both just tell that I or both of us don't want to talk any more. He sighs. I smoke. Seconds pass. He keeps sighing, but it doesn't make me anxious because they don't sound like angry sighs. They seemed to be completely unrelated to emotions of any sort. He keeps doing his sighs every 20 seconds or so. Then he starts to look at me after he does it. I think to myself. I stop tensing up that there is a human next to me. I start to take deep breaths. Everything sped back up. I hadn't even realized that I was breathing so shallow, after noticing me breathing. Got up

I sat there a little longer, his footsteps got louder. As I breathed I noticed things moving, like leaves blowing or insects flitting past. The wind became a luscious symphony. My awareness became 100% active. I need to meditate on this. It's like the guy could tell that a teenager sitting in the forest not wanting to talk and not wanting to breathe, needed help. And he understood that he didn't have to talk to do it.

I practiced breathing as I swam in the creek, and unhappy; when around people I deem better/wiser than me I am reclusive, and unhappy, and how this led me to have a dismal outlook on life.

It was then that I realized. You don't do everything that you feel. You feel everything that you do. That is completely separate from how often you give fucks. If you fully engage in everything you do, and what experiences can next build on this one. If you try to think about what is best, you will stress yourself out. You have to use the world, it's your perceptional filter. When you lose touch with that filter, you are only filtered by the self. And that is a fucking scary, unhealthy filter to use.

Breathe. Relax. Let thoughts emerge, they'll end, and you'll survive through it. And if you do, then you get to give some fucks about it, and that feels kind of good.

I left her a note saying ""BTW I think you're really cute! ;-)""  I was done there, beaming like I had just stolen some honey from the nearest hive, I didn't expect her to do anything about it, it was really all about me being brave and telling a pretty girl she was pretty.  But when she paid with her check, and *literally* all I had to do was be honest with myself and her

1366629735.0,1cuvle,A simple exercise I plan to do whenever anxiety is uncontrollably running through my veins.,kitfo,339,44,33,"**What kind of feeling do you have right now?**

A feeling of anxiety where I am self conscious about every minor action I make. This self-consciousness gets exasperated the more I am situated in my head and think about the regrets of the past events and unpredictability of future events. It is also increased around specific people and it’s making living life more difficult for me.

**Why do you feel this way?**

I think if I don’t do something right or pleasing to another individual that it will negatively affect what they think of me.  The funny thing is the more I overanalyze my thoughts and actions the more unnatural and forced they look when I am doing them. 

**Why do others’ thoughts of you matter to you so much?**

I want to be loved by others, especially those that are not significant in my life, but at the same time there is a need to let individual’s around me affect what I think of me. I think this is a battle of my inner being and my ego.

**How do you get over this?**

Know that no matter where you are in life, there is only one thing that stays constant. YOU! As pessimistic as this may sound, your friends, lovers, families are all going to die at some unpredictable point. If you rely on those people for determining your self-worth you will be disappointed when they are gone. Not to mention, people aren’t perfect and can let you down at any point. The only person that can determine your validation self worth, and worthiness is YOURSELF. 

**Conclusion:**

I'm not here to tell you that reading will make you stop giving fucks.

I'm not here to tell you that writing  or drawing will make you stop giving fucks.

Not giving a fuck is allowing yourself to let go. Saying ""yes"" to things. Trying as many different things as you can will help. 

""Happiness is like a butterfly- The more you chase it, it will come and sit softly on your shoulder.""

Now although the comparison of happiness to a butterfly is rather cliche from Thoreau, as an entity you have to do something, so perhaps you should do things that you enjoy doing or actually want to try, instead of sitting vapid and doing whatever you're told (like I used to.). Maybe that's weight lifting. Maybe it's physics. Maybe it's meditation. Maybe it's playing an instrument.

I guess the message that I want somebody to hear is *do something.* It's was *right in front of my face for years and I never realized.* You can talk to all the girls/boys you want if you let go, neutrons and electrons, but we can do amazing things.

The Fall:

First off

Also

I was in San Diego for a convention and a few days after I came home

The next morning

This shit wasn't adding up.  I asked her if she was out with some guy...if she was cheating on me...

At first she denied anything then she started crying and said about 8 months prior she was at a family reunion and started seeing...wait for it...her cousin secretly.  He is a married 40ish guy with 5 kids AND HER FUCKING COUSIN!  She told me the Vegas trip she recently went on with her girlfriend was really just a front to meet this guy.  She said they fucked all over Vegas.  In the Mirage bathroom, she would leave me and the boys and marry him in an instant.

I almost threw up.

She said she didn't love me anymore and she wasn't happy.  This was all news to me.  I thought we had a great family going.  Two awesome sons (3 and 8 years old)

Apparently

I then found out later that she also was fucking my friend/neighbor when I was in San Diego.  She would bring this fucker over to my home, even after I came home, she would sneak out at night and go to his house and fuck.  

Who is this fucking woman?

I couldn't believe it.  I got the fuck out of Dodge and took my kids to my mom's house about 3 hours away to regroup.  She fucked him again in his car when we were gone.

We get divorced and put our home up for sale.  This period was hard because I had to live with her (she had no money or job skills and I didn't want to kick my kid's mom to the curb).  During this period

After selling the house

Again

After a few months of this

Eventually

Also



The Rise:

I focus on getting my house in order.  I had never dealt with bills or anything so I learn all about that.  I sell my car and buy a new Infiniti. I sign up for meetup.com and join several groups.  Some of these groups are Divorce Support groups and I find them invaluable.  I discover I am not alone.  My problems are shared by others.  

I start working out and getting in shape.  I start doing Yoga and smiling a bit more.  I'm feeling more relaxed about things.

I went to a meetup.com ""Lock and Key"" event.  It's basically a setting to meet people and see if you click with any of them.  I met a girl there who contacted me later on that night.  We've been going out every since.  She is nice

Bottom line.  I felt at one point there was no future.  Life was over.  All I put into the last 20 years was flushed down the fucking drain.  But as I bent over to look down that fucking drain

I would write more but I can't.  You see

Peace Honey Badgers.  

EDIT:  I forgot to add-the night when she told me she went to go see a movie with her girlfriend....that was a lie. She was really out with the neighbor guy that night.

This leads to detachment from society and giving off the appearance of aloofness. Type one is where some people stay permanently. Type one is a riot shield

Type Two is where you realize that you don't need to masquerade aloofness or detachment to people because at a fundamental

The unpopular truth about being Type Two is that it takes time. A significant amount of time. NGAF becomes a tool you use to tighten the loose screws in your life and the only way to tighten a screw is to use the right tool and apply the right pressure.

Don't get stuck in Type One. Walking around with a riot shield will eventually tire you. It'll limit your interactions with others because there will always be a barrier.

Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the Word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your Word in the direction of truth and love.

2. **Don’t Take Anything Personally**  
Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality

3. **Don’t Make Assumptions**  
Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings

4. **Always Do Your Best**

I had been told from a young age that if I wanted to go to college

Now, doesn't everybody do that nowadays?  Well, you see, that's only the start of my story.  The real beginning of my story begins the day before I graduated.  It was the day I received an email from my department head informing me that I wouldn't graduate.  

Now, having devoted my time and effort for four years to achieve this goal.  I drove two hours from the city I was in simply to meet with said head of department and see what the deal was.  You see, I had actually earned 150% of the required credits for graduation.  That's right, boys and girls, I had done the effort for one and a half degrees.  Six years of work in four years, while working two jobs.  So I was slightly pissed about being told I wasn't graduating when I had indeed satisfied all the hoops they put me through to earn that piece of paper.

Of course, and forwarded me to the people who were issuing degrees.  They referred me to something a dean of my major had said several years back.  Several years in which policy had changed and said dean had left and been replaced.

Of course, got approval for it, and then got his boss, the dean of the college, to vouch for me.  I then went back to the people denying that piece of paper I had worked so hard to obtain with signed letters from the dean in the deans hand.

They recognized me the next day when I picked up my diploma.

It has been said that the most powerful of men is one who has mastered his emotions. In my case, but here is my letter to my future self to help along the way: 

**Fear:**


Fear is a peculiar animal. While it will convince you that you are going to die, whether you are scheduled to speak in front of a thousand people for the first time, or you are running from a bear, the physiological response to fear the same: FIGHT or FLIGHT, STOP or GO, adrenaline, cold sweat, nausea, regardless of whether or not *you* believe you will die. Although it may be silly to consider, but the mind doesn’t. It treats the situation equally.

**TL;DR Giving fucks is natural.**



The tricky part is finding out how to teach the mind that it won't be killed in a non-lethal situation. Logic would tell you (as many have) that all you have to do is to “get over it, suddenly, that we weren’t afraid of bears or cliffs, we would get ourselves killed. 

**TL;DR How to give zero fucks is confusing because brain.**



Now, outrun bears and fly. How do they do it? Well, like intelligence or running speed, we are born with a certain give a fuck temperament. But talent only goes so far and fearlessness can be learned with time. You’ve got to work with what you’ve got and the best time to start is now. 

**TL;DR Start learning now.**



What now? Sometimes you’ll look back and notice that your give a fuck level increased dramatically in a certain situation. Focus on that situation and seek to understand where the fear came from. Sometimes, or a director, a friend, or even a job requirement) then we would probably be more adventurous in the short term, and become more kick ass in the long run. The reality of it is simple: You must subject yourself to the fear. You must find a way to remind yourself to be fearless, and seek out situations that require such. In other words, fucking go out and do it. Start small if you have to. Start big if you want to. Talk. Speak. See. Discover. You may find that the process is quick. You may find that it is the hardest thing you have ever done. When you get in trouble, they put a fucking robot on Mars.

**TL;DR Find out and seek out what makes you give fucks.**



I have been shamed by my social insecurities. I have avoided opportunities for fear of failure. I have alienated people for fear of rejection. For my entire life I have struggled to rise above my own mediocrity. I have taken my time for granted. I have not deeply loved any soul



**Not any fucking more.**

To this post, and inspirations I will often refer (should you provide them). I foresee a long and arduous process and it starts today. Please offer your theories, ideas, disagreements or whatever you would.

**To this goal, to love myself, to love others,  to give zero fucks I pledge myself.**

Mark my words; OP will deliver.

Although the past 3-4 months have been grueling, overcome the most significant of my fucks. I've studied, read, learned, tried, focused, and fought to overcome my fears. I've put myself out there either to succeed or fail more times in the past several months than in the span of my many years. I can hereby clarify–for those of you who doubt the possibility–that yes. It can be done.

This is not to say I don't have my downs–we all do. It is to say that the *ratio* of my ups to downs is dramatically improved–consistently better.

Although there is little evidence that I can provide, and performing again. I have begun writing the screenplay I thought I'd never start. I can speak with my Dad without worrying about disapproval. I can be alone with a stranger and shoot shit. I can ask a girl for her number without having a seizure. I can speak in front of people without having my heart shut off my brain. People that I have known for many years tell me I've got a new ""spark"".

Everything lies in the ability of your mind to overpower the natural fear that exists in the subconscious. We have been given the gift of reason, is powerfully effective against even the mind that created it. You must find the ability to will away your fears.

I get some social anxiety when I'm in noisy public places with lots of people. I'm also a very calculating person. I have a hard time being spontaneous and ""letting go"". I also have a tendency to stress easily.

Recently, whom I was briefly introduced to. I instantly found Sarah very attractive. My spidey sense told me that Sarah found me attractive as well, but unfortunately, both of us were too shy to say anything, and very few words were exchanged. I felt embarrassed and withdrew to go have a drink at the bar by myself.

About 20 minutes later, asks if I'm interested. Having started to embrace the honey badger within, I simply respond with two words: ""fuck yeah!"". I spend more time talking with Mandy and others, having a very relaxed time. The ecstasy slowly begins kicking in, until I can feel its effect in full about 45 minutes later. Ecstasy is a peculiar drug. For those who have never tried it, I would say that it has the effect of removing all discomfort, both mental and physical. It's extremely relaxing and confidence inducing. Unlike alcohol

Later in the evening, and ask if she wants to dance. We dance for a brief moment. My spidey sense tingles again, I'm convinced that she's totally into me. All of a sudden, I blurt out: ""Would you like it if went down on you?"". It has to be the drug. I could never say something so blunt normally. I just hope that this won't end with me getting a very hard slap in the face, and fortunately, it doesn't: she gives me her hotel room number. I did end up going there later that night, and had a very good time with her and another girl (!).

Perhaps this is a bit of a crazy story. Clearly, however, is that sometimes, being confident can pay off big. If I'd been shy, and had not even spoken to Sarah, she would have gone back to her home city and I might have never seen her again. I also learned to trust my intuition. I was convinced that Sarah was into me, I could just feel it. I could have been wrong, my intuition is accurate.

Furthermore, and your personality is not unchangeable. I rarely take ecstasy, and I wouldn't want to be taking it all the time, but I can remember how I felt when I was on it, how easy everything seemed, and channel some of this, even without the drug.",False,revelation,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/197qx7/how_ecstasy_changed_my_personality/

The problem with this philosophy is that it is only Step 1 of learning to NGAF and applying it to your everyday life. So often on this subreddit people assume that Not Giving a Fuck is about apathy with respect to difficult situations. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Not giving a fuck is about disregarding barriers that inhibit you from achieving your complete freedom and complete potential.

Not giving a fuck therefore requires action. Disregard the problems that are currently limiting you but ask yourself what you can do to transcend the situation rather than ignore it. Not giving a fuck and living life as you always have is merely an inoculation against the symptoms of your problems instead of reorganizing yourself to root out the cause.

Want to overcome social anxiety? Mediate. What to get over a significant other or family member that is causing substantial stress in your life? Find a way to distance yourself or limit their impact on your happiness. All circumstance require YOU to take ACTIVE steps at improving your own happiness.

First
** **
**A boatman is rowing upsteam and sees another boat, watch out! Change your course, asshole!  Look out!""  The boat, however, continues to rush towards him.  The boatman is seething, this isn't how things are supposed to be done, he's giving 1000 fucks.  Now as it comes closer
** **

Ramakrishna, *""The one who is angry is like a boat which has no captain. When you see there is no captain, steer away. Don't stand and throw words back at the boat in anger. Steer aside. Otherwise neither boat has a captain.""* 


In modern terms, range far and wide and remain open to experience.  I know that I am going to experience boats rushing towards me that have no captain -- angry drunks looking for a fight, manipulative people looking to get something from me I am not freely willing to give, lovers with whom expectations and boundaries painfully fall out of alignment. 

Why is it so important to NGAF in these situations?

Simple -- you've got the best chance of **steering around them** with a calm, and unfulfillment of desire.  

Some additional quotes from some of my favorite authors that help illustrate what I'm talking about:

**Alan Watts:**


“Life is like music for its own sake. We are living in an eternal now, we are listening to an expanded present.”  
** **
“When we attempt to exercise power or control over someone else
** **
“One is a great deal less anxious if one feels perfectly free to be anxious
** **

**Robert Anton Wilson**:

""You are precisely as big as what you love and precisely as small as what you allow to annoy you.""
** **
“I don't believe anything
** **
""In conlusion
** **

Two books that I highly recommend by Alan Watts

[The Wisdom of Insecurity](http://www.amazon.com/The-Wisdom-Insecurity-Message-Anxiety/dp/0307741206)

[The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are](http://www.amazon.com/Book-Taboo-Against-Knowing-Who/dp/0679723005)

I give this latter one away too often to ever retain a copy.  


 

Finally, far more difficult to attain.

**TL;DR**: Maintain an internal locus of control and focus and understand why you are not giving fucks as opposed to just how to not give them.

I started off working in kitchens as a dishwasher. In case you don't know, because nobody wants to do that if they quit. I actually liked it. Turn on the music, load up the wrack, dirty dishes in, clean out, wax on, wax off... you get the picture. I would actually use the time to go over my college homework, and even design D&amp;D worlds
Eventually, etc... and moved to a bigger, better paying kitchen. I still loved cooking and enjoyed being in the ""zone"" when tickets were flying in and out, food was perfect, and you got to drink a case of beer after work with your line buddies. I was good enough to get promoted to sous chef, and took the job, even though it meant an actual hourly pay cut with more responsibilities.

I was good at this, lazy bitch who threw temper tantrums in my kitchen. 6 nights a week, 60+ hours, and I loved it. Things were great, I got a few awards, it was awesome. Then I asked for a raise. ""Sure, its in the works"" was the reply for about 8 months. Then they switched bosses, yeah, then I say ""Look

So I kept doing the job, at a salary much higher than my old rate, and I ask if I can get that salary as a sous chef. ""Well, you have to apply for the job,"" which I had been doing for 5 years. ""Fine, I'm no longer a sous chef. Find somebody else to close the kitchen 6 nights a week. I'm paid the same as a line cook, so that's what I'm going to do now.""

Time passes. I am back on the line, and he starts trying to bully the staff. I, as a former manager, know what is and isn't allowed by company policy. People start coming to me when they question his instructions, I tell them what the actual policy is, and what they can do to counter him. Chef, understandably, but most of the people we work with don't speak english too well, but stuff our company frowns upon. My outspoken defiance gets me transfered off the line and into the ""steward"" position. I don't care, plus I no longer work nights. Awesome. Angry that I haven't quit

It sounds simplistic to say *the best way to stop giving fucks is to stop giving fucks*. I know as well as anyone that letting go is neither easy nor permanent. Shit will hit fans so long as the world contains both fans and shit. The urge to freak out and give a fuck will spark time and time again

My point, because it's *fucking life*. The next shitstorm is already coming for you. All that matters is how you face it.

I wish onto you, but that person believes you can do it.

1372609974.0,1hdclm,I had the ultimate sign from the universe last night...,bhrealnm,304,58,37,"I had one of the best nights of my life last night. My friend and I are in an acoustic rock cover duo and had just played one of our best gigs ever at a local winery. The response was very good from everyone at the venue and we made out pretty well money wise. After we packed up all of our equipment back at my friend's house we decide to head out to get something to eat. This is when my friend informs me that my ex-girlfriend texted him saying that she was in town. At this moment I got mad because I hate it when she texts my friends.. But then I got to thinking

So we get to the diner and when we are seated by the waitress I see a bunch of people from high school that I could have ever gone without seeing again all seated in close proximity to me. It turns out their bands had a show the same night in the same town at a really crappy venue and they ended up here after the show. They immediately make note of my presence and start talking about me and what not, and again does it matter? NO!

What I took away from last night is that I really can't control how other people behave, my friends it's small steps to becoming a true honey badger and last night was the first step for me. I hope you found this enlightening and inspiring and if not, IDGAF.

Connected/ing the dots to help me find the roots of my problems.",,298,60, or just simply by how they perceived me. I still carry a lot of that weight today

I don't know if I was ""addicted"" to Facebook by its definition, going through posts concerning equal rights and inspirational quotes, because that's the kind of person I want to be. I want to be fair, compassionate, confident and strong. Facebook had just stopped me in my tracks and I didn't even realise it until I got rid of it. The first few days were horrible, like quitting smoking or drinking. I got ""withdrawals"", but mostly I hated myself being on there anyway so I was partly motivated to keep away.

I unsubscribed from everyone because I hated seeing them so happy. I've been spending the past few years growing, which I still sometimes have trouble thinking about even a year later. After I lost my first love, I started losing everything else, as I thought to myself. 

Before that, I was always the one trying to entertain people and I loved it, not a problem in the world (excluding the occasional schoolgirl fights and whatnot). Penultimate year of elementary/primary school, she suddenly stopped hanging around me. She went over to the ""popular"" people of the school and bagged me with them. Now that I think of it, I believe it might have been influenced by her mother's coercion to hang around more ""decent"" folk? I don't know, her mother had some high status in the school and was in good with the principle, and my family just went through a divorce and we've always been poor.

I was alienated from everyone, like I cared. But to be put in that kind of position still made me feel like some sort of circus freak - I was that weird kid and I didn't even know it, even with their ongoing attempts to make me look absolutely foolish over anything I ever did.

This continued throughout my first few years of high school but I had a lot going on at home as well. My biological father (I'd rather call him Dan) was emotionally, my only parent. He has the mindset of a child and argues like one with a temper. Incessant yelling, mocking me in a baby-like voice (even when I told him about my panic attacks), many bad memories. Again, I was made to feel unimportant and irrelevant to anything.

Moved back in with mum when I realised how abusive Dan had become, I don't know. I don't want to think about it really. This aroused a lot of mistrust, especially since they were always shit talking each other when I was starting school.

I was depressed throughout school, but it still hit me where it hurt and changed me for life. I started perceiving relationships and people differently. I was more compassionate and I had a desire for a relationship in a different, more valuable form than your stereotypical high school partner. But wait, if I feel like such a wreck, how am I supposed to get some thing like that again?

During our relationship, which had changed slightly over the years in retaliation to the bullying.


**The whole entire point of this post**; I didn't realise the most part of **anything** I wrote above until I deactivated and reflected on myself. I reviewed my general behaviour and thought of what I liked and didn't like about myself. I wanted to change the things I didn't like that were changeable, need help on the others and connecting more dots. I've booked an appointment with a counselor from a large youth mental health corporation because I want to make myself a better person so I can have a better life.

**My current take on FB:** It looks pretty much the same to me, **nothing was changing**. All I did was wait for something, and I waited for years. I now perceive Facebook as a prison at worst and an addiction at best. I'm not looking at escaping my problems and imprisoning myself in a standstill world, I'm fucking changing my life and Facebook is a cunt that only contributed to my issues.

**TL;DR: My advice that I urge all of you to take, it's just a way I found useful for me to take initiative in my mind rather than letting outer influences outside of it control me. In a more accurate context, realise that your problems are internal, and it is your choice to make whether you internalise certain things. Differentiate your emotions from your reasoning, because only you know the truth about your own experiences and no one else does.**

My dilemma is this: three good friends of mine have told me on three separate occasions that the best option to do is to just avoid her. That also appears to be the most repeated advice that reddit has to offer on the subject of friendzoned guys.

And ya know what? I actually took that advice to heart. I don’t seek her out

Problem is, for the simple fact that she has very few other people she could possibly hang out with. And this wouldn’t be so bad, if not for the fact that hanging out with her makes me feel like shit afterwards (being reminded of what you can’t have).

She may only be hanging out with this obviously smitten guy to get her fix of social interaction/confidence boost, though, and says “So what? Even if that were true, you’re only bringing this up because you’re putting your brain where your cock is. You’re not her boyfriend, you have no obligation to keep her happy. If she’s lonely, that’s her problem”. At which point another voice in my head slaps me and says “Now you just sound like an asshole”.

As it is

1.	Return to our “normal friendship” and just hang out with her again. This option is obviously one that I don’t feel like taking … The few months where we were “just friends” felt fun

2.	Confront her. Tell her upright that it is impossible for us to be friends and that I want her to leave me alone. I feel guilty enough just avoiding her normally

3.	Continue as is. Avoid her where possible

* 

First up

You've just become a predator. A predator that *has* to catch it's prey or if not

This continues for *twenty* more minutes and she gives up. She's gone, wasn't you?

* 

Nope. It wasn't *you* that messed up. It was the mistake that messed up the whole situation. The mistake of not asking her out. This is the first thing I need to address to people in this subreddit

*You are not your mistakes*, advancing forwards in life. If you don't learn, what human being are *you*? Ask yourself this question loudly. 

And as an added note

* 

What I told you I possessed of earlier in this text, also known as *psychology*, that will make fear totally irrelevant.

Do you remember sitting in the cafe all up in your head thinking about that woman? Two things are happening at that moment. Firstly you are possibly objectifying the woman. Thinking of her as an sexual achievement once you've conquered her. This is something you have to quit doing. Imminently. Secondly

So basically, compared to the whole brain, the frontal lobes doesn't cover much activity. Because the rest of the brain, the unconscious parts, takes care of 70% of the overall activity. 

So when the unconsciousness is in charge of so much

This is where emotions play it's part. Emotions form when your unconsciousness is talking to you. It wants you to feel happy after achieving something so it releases dopamine. The same goes for when you are feeling anger towards someone who have done something very stupid. It's just chemicals being released into your system.  Just try to back off

It also wants you to feel fear if there are dangers around. Like a lion or a rhino. 

However, and of course the brain hasn't developed for 2013. That would take hundreds of thousands of years. So now the brain is feeling fear of rejection because there's no real danger around, and your fear is simply dysfunctional as of today.

Why would you feel fear towards approaching someone? A long lasting relationship or a one night stand is among the best things on this earth. Compare getting rejected and dying on the savanna. There's no connection. That is why fear of rejection breaks all logic what so ever.

 So snap out of it

It doesn't matter who it is (most of the time) we just truly feel free when someone accepts us for who we are at the deepest level; accepting our faults and imperfections knowing full well that we have them. 

Understand this... Nothing in life feels as good as this feeling!
As social creatures we need it; we need to be loved. We need it to be healthy, this love. 
Why not give yourself this feeling?
Love yourself.
Insecurity or giving too many fucks lies in the belief that we are not worthy of being loved, we really start to believe it, and then people inevitably see it. People see it because the world takes you at your own estimate. So if you don't love yourself why would anyone else bother trying to do something you can't do for yourself, especially when most of time they are worried about the exact same shit as you.
People are going to judge you no matter what. Always for the rest of your life. People are very literally going to hate you and say awful shit about you behind your back. I guarantee you they already have and they always will, LOVED people do their thing and don't give a fuck what others think of them while they are doing it. If you live your life freely and love yourself then good, like-minded, imperfectly perfect people will happen in your life and those are the relationships truly worth keeping.
So don't worry. Let go of the heavy lies you carry around that say,"" or whatever the fuck your useless lies are telling you.
It doesn't matter. 
Love yourself and you will experience life as it was truly meant to be lived.

At the most basic level, the spiritual philosophy of not giving a fuck.

You don't need to give shit up, you don't need to follow all this strict rules about respect and shit, just *let life fucking happen.* And then Lao Tzu wrote a book

The basic idea is that you just have to follow the direction you're supposed to go, you shouldn't be greedy, but don't give up everything because that's fucking stupid. Sure, Confucius has got a point, you should respect your elders and stuff, but when you have too many rules it won't be long before shit gets crazy up in here.

Now, I am not a good dancer, nor do I like dancing in public because of various self-esteem issues about my weight. However, there are certain songs that are impossible for me NOT to dance to, and while it may only be a slight hip swaying, I do find myself laughing and moving to the music.

Now, however, on the first couple days everyone is either too awkward or shy to actually do anything about the wont to dance. 

At least

On the very first day, but I refrained and milled around with all of the other bashful participants.

And then someone starting dancing.

And not just bobbing to the music, tan, with impeccable hair and body and he managed to be a crossover of Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson, with a couple splashes of impressive Shakira moves stuck in, all at the same time.

By this time everyone is standing with their mouths hanging open and a couple people had started to clap. As I watched the urge to move grew and grew and with a sudden swell of that very special, I started to dance too.

Somewhere in the song we started doing a swing routine together and I managed to remember several relatively easy

When the song was done everyone laughed and clapped and congratulated us. Dancer guy and I started talking and he told me he was thrilled someone had had the courage to get up dance with him.
Throughout the conversation we learned we had incredible similarities and that we both enjoyed each other's company greatly.

Today is our two year anniversary and I couldn't be happier. :)

I see a lot of *great* advice here

First, but it does entail deleting apps from your phone, disabling your accounts, or simply avoiding all social network-related websites for the entire month of January. The goal is to re-establish the focus on yourself and to be out of the loop, so to speak, and to not give a fuck about what is happening in everyone else's life except your own. I have discovered that I feel a lot better *in general* when I take extended breaks or heavily moderate my activity on sites like Twitter and Facebook.

Second, a shitty friend, a girlfriend or boyfriend that isn't worth your time anymore, being out of shape, or anything else that you believe needs to change now, not later. I can not tell you enough that if you're on the path to not giving a fuck, that improving your own life goes hand-in-hand. 

And third, be better than them. You don't know how to talk to women? Start talking to yourself in a mirror for 5 minutes every day and start from there.

This sub-reddit is all about encouragement, even if only one person tries any of these suggestions or tips out.

Granted, and have a few friends there. But for a while - nearly two years, I relied on that solely as my means of social interaction outside of work.

But, I started reaching out to people I knew from a long time back through Facebook. Good acquaintances I've met through my classes, cool people I've met at my university orientation, people I used to work with, etc. Basically, I scanned for names I recognized, thought were cool people

To my surprise, but that's understandable, since there are a lot of people who've added me on a whim on Facebook after having spoken to me for only ten minutes and having gotten my name.

I got one good guy (who I had a class with and sat next to because I learned that he was a big gamer) agree to meet me today for a couple of beers at his place. I hadn't seen this guy in like two years. I met him

I've also managed to get a girl I haven't seen since freshman year agree to meet me on Thursday evening. So far

So, but it's also a giant address book, if you use it (I really didn't use Facebook much, I just kept adding friend requests). After all, Facebook is another tool, and it is what you do with it that counts.

I am, and it doesn't seem like it will be going away soon like most of my problems do.

Anyway.. I lived some life over the last year.  I've read some books.  I've made some mistakes.  And I have deepened my understanding.  Take this for what it is

Over the course of the last year, but only with one was it transcendental and wholly loving.

Here is a list of stuff that have been important in shaping me over the last year.

1) Meditation.

2) Recognizing meaning exists outside of language.

3) Good and evil are present in every moment of existence.

4) Whether you recognize it or not

5) The emotions you feel during communication are felt by more than just you

6) People crave relationships with other people who come from a state of love.

7) Confidence and peace are found within oneself

8) Trusting intuition on a more even plane with logic.

9) The importance of staying present.  If you are honest with yourself, maintain your sense of presence, and full exist and be with everything/everyone that is in your presence.

In my opinion, and we'd live in a happier society. But that's just my two-cents.

My real reason for posting today is to share a bit of advice that I just gained through a revelation. We've had really nice weather at my college all week along, sounds, and smells. I was taken back to the carefree nature of my childhood in which I would go outside and simply explore.

My experiences today got me to thinking about my life as a child, be with friends, and enjoy every moment of it. After going through middle and high school, though, as the responsibilities piled up, I slowly lost this mentality. I began to worry about everything: what people thought of me, what work I had to get done

By taking a hike today, I can't just give up on all of my responsibilities, but I can ease my tensions and aid my mental health by being adventurous sometimes and not caring if people like it or not.

The article explains the difference between Loneliness and Aloneness. 

"" Aloneness is beautiful, they look the same. But in reality, they are worlds apart. Aloneness is our nature. Loneliness is us running away from it.""

This struck me and I begun to really give it thought

""Once you delight in yourself, a pale imitation. ""A sham. That’s what the entire game of romance is. Who is our “romance” really about? Us, and us alone. We say – I love you. But what we really mean is – Please love me. Manipulation is all it is.

It clicked in my head that deep down I was just selfish. It makes sense. He continues to say...

""Lonely people cannot Love; they can only pretend to

It was a wake-up-call and hopefully to whoever is going through the same thing, it's fucked up.

So now I'm trying to really love myself and accept my ""aloneness"" and not worry about love. If you are intrigued by this article you should check out his other stuff. His post on Ego was what started it for me

Every once in a while, and a cold, sad one replace it.  It only lasts a few seconds until, after he looks down, immediately shows a Cheshire Cat grin.  I asked him about it one day.

""Sometimes

""Okay..."" I reply

""I do.  Any time I think about something that would depress me if I put much thought into it, with a soft smile, he turns away to resume his work.

I began to pick up on it over the next few weeks.  Once I noticed it at first, once again, compelled to ask him about it.

""Mind if I ask what the bad memories are?""

His face goes from inviting to stoic and back again almost instantly.

""What would you like to know?""  He says

""Well

To this day, and a laundry list of interactions that would make most people never trust or love again.  Yet here he is, smiling while detailing his dark past to me in a grocery aisle.  Tears nearly spill from my eyes as he continues to, seemingly happily, tell me of his past.  When he's done, I'm speechless.  Many moments pass before I say anything.

""Are you ever happy

""That is something I WON'T tell you.""  He replies

""How do you do it?""

""What do you mean?""

""How can you act so cheerful and fun when you have such sad things running around your mind?""

""I ask myself some questions:

Does feeling sad or angry about it make me feel better afterward?

Does feeling sad or angry accomplish anything for me or others?

Does feeling sad or angry change anything?

In the end

I'm a spiteful person.  I know there are people who wish to see me falter, I do my best to remain strong, make others happy, and to succeed.  I'm doing my best to be the best because I can, and I will.""

1336946145.0,tli2z,My life has changed due to Project Mayhem.,threwawary34,186,15,48,"I've been meaning to make a post about PM and how much it has helped me. I started it about two weeks ago and my life has changed **drastically** since then. 


I'm pretty shy and always fear people are looking at me or judging everything I do. I've been growing very tired of this and eventually found this subreddit by total accident. I saw the PM threads and thought

I came very close to not doing this task

So, mostly due to students packing up and getting ready to leave for the summer. There were a ton of people just chilling in the yard, talking, eating, etc.

I found an empty spot of grass and sat down cross legged. I've never meditated before but what the hell, sitting cross legged, and you got me. I stuck out like a bleeding thumb.

I have to say the first 2 or so minutes was down right terrifying. I was sweating and my heart was beating so fast, and I was so scared that they were laughing at me.

But they weren't. I opened my eyes and found where the laugh was coming from. It was coming from a group of girls laughing at something another girl in the group had said. They weren't paying me any attention. And I looked around at everyone else and that's when I noticed *no one* was paying attention to me. No one gave a flying fuck about what I was doing!

At that point I calmed down considerably and went back to 'meditating'. Really all I did was keep my eyes closed and thought about how this really wasn't so bad for about 20 more minutes. It was pretty relaxing and afterwards I stood up and left, buddy!"" before patting me on my shoulder and leaving to do whatever it was she was doing when she crossed my path. 

I've always been able to think that, either. It just wasn't until I actually *did* something that I realized, holy shit, **they really don't care!**. I can't even describe how profound this knowledge is once you finally understand it. It's like someone gave me glasses and I'm seeing what the world really looks like around me for the first time.

This task made me try a few more when I came back to my parent's house for the summer. I ordered Mc Donalds when I went to Taco Bell, something like this would have made me so embarrassed (and I admit the first time I did this, it was slightly embarrassing) but  not anymore. The 2nd time I did this, another thing clicked for me. The people taking my order didn't *care* that I messed and ordered the wrong food. They either gave a polite laugh or just simply informed me I was at the wrong place. As soon as I said ""Oh, my bad"", they just continued on with their lives. 

They didn't ridicule me or grab a co worker and inform them of my mistake. They just said ""Next"" and did their job. Again, but experiencing it is totally different. It's a real ""Ah ha!"" moment, knowing that it isn't a big deal. By the 3rd time I did this, I knew I didn't need to do it anymore. 

Today, so this was pretty hard for me because I didn't want them to ridicule me. I went into both stores and while it was a bit difficult finding clothes that fit me, eventually I did. 

And I loved the way I looked. I felt fucking great! So great that I got a new hair style (cut off the 'skater boy' hair and got  something much more shorter and NEATER) and bought new shoes to go with my awesome new outfit. By the end of the day

Of course, then I don't need them. 

I was met with mixed reactions. Sisters and parents loved it and couldn't stop gushing about how good I looked. Friends asked what the fuck was wrong with me and made fun of me. I brushed them off and acted like I didn't care (which

My only regret is trying these tasks at the end of the school year

 If I could offer you only one tip for the future
  
   Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. Oh, you’ll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can’t grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You are not as fat as you imagine.

   Don’t worry about the future. Or worry

  Do one thing every day that scares you.

  Sing.

  Don’t be reckless with other people’s hearts. Don’t put up with people who are reckless with yours.

  Floss.

  Don’t waste your time on jealousy. Sometimes you’re ahead, it’s only with yourself.

  Remember compliments you receive. Forget the insults. If you succeed in doing this

  Keep your old love letters. Throw away your old bank statements.

  Stretch.

  Don’t feel guilty if you don’t know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn’t know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don’t.

  Get plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees. You’ll miss them when they’re gone.

  Maybe you’ll marry, maybe you’ll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary. Whatever you do, don’t congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself either. Your choices are half chance. So are everybody else’s.

  Enjoy your body. Use it every way you can. Don’t be afraid of it or of what other people think of it. It’s the greatest instrument you’ll ever own.

  Dance

  Read the directions

  Do not read beauty magazines. They will only make you feel ugly.

  Get to know your parents. You never know when they’ll be gone for good. Be nice to your siblings. They’re your best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.

  Understand that friends come and go, the more you need the people who knew you when you were young.

  Live in New York City once

  Travel.

  Accept certain inalienable truths: Prices will rise. Politicians will philander. You, you’ll fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.

  Respect your elders.

  Don’t expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund. Maybe you’ll have a wealthy spouse. But you never know when either one might run out.

  Don’t mess too much with your hair or by the time you’re 40 it will look 85.

  Be careful whose advice you buy, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it’s worth.

  But trust me on the sunscreen.

Not giving a fuck doesn't extend to things like your job and your grades- those are real things that you should give a fuck about because they will affect your later quality of life. Not giving a fuck is more geared towards things that have minimal physical impact on your life. These things are almost always social things.

For example

Not giving a fuck is about removing yourself from the social currents that rule everybody else's lives. Identify whose opinion matters- your boss

The person you run into on the street will never see you again. Go ahead and pick your nose in front of him. That guy you sometimes run into at work/school? You know, chances are their opinion doesn't matter in the real world anyway.

I thought I'd share the story of going out clubbing the other night and not giving a fuck, and how happy doing something similar might make you.

The first step was getting a couple of beers with friends at your good old typical English pub, this soon turned into me dancing and talking to this girl - I know, right? She was really cool and we spent a long time together, getting pretty close, but after a while she seemed kind of uneasy, looking round at her friends. Turns out she was from another town for the night and felt bad for spending time with me instead of them. I figured your typical douche would get pissy at her and grind her some more out of frustration, or take it as her shooting them down brutally, instead I just said in her ear 'it was lovely to meet you

After that though, so I made it my personal mission to get them all dancing. I had a giggle dancing like a wanker in front of them, beckoning them up - they didn't all dance with me, but they all smiled or laughed. In the end I was there until almost sunrise with two guys I don't even know, bro-hugged the shit out of them, ruined my voice singing along to shitty music, and had the most fun I've had in a long time.

Maybe I'm overthinking it, I'm not claiming to be free of all inhibitions magically. It made me realise that not giving a fuck isn't about giving you the confidence/security to be able to get laid, or to not look like a dick; it's the ability to not give a fuck either way, and to just have a great time. You should do so too, and have fun looking like a total fuckwit.

He prioritized and made a split decision, and sometimes you end up missing out.

I made the mistake of not following this simple piece of advice, but it is still a challenge. However, I can still think clearly and I’m able to feel happiness. I just discovered this now though.

Couple of years ago, and he was an abusive prick. They never met each other face to face. As you can see, she was miserable (or so I thought) with her life, but wasn’t able to break up with the guy. She said that I was her best friend, that she loved me, yadda yadda yadda. And I, stupid as it may sound, because I loved her. And she used this to exploit my weaknesses, no nothing. Just living with my illusion

When I reached my limit, but he was trying to help me be happy for myself (or so I thought, again). He talked to her about me, tried to support her problems so I could get some weight from my shoulders. And then my best and only friend became friends with the girl I wanted to stop loving. Fast forward a few weeks, she breaks up with her boyfriend. Oh boy, that was awesome.  And then she said she didn’t love me anymore, that or friendship was hanging by a thread. And then banged my only best friend. And he went away (not physically)

And this is when I had enough of this fucking bullshit. I devoted myself to 2 persons who used me and threw me away when they didn’t need me anymore. My mistake was to value what they said so much. I followed their words like they were Gods, I thought he was my friend, and he ended up calling me a loser and a piece of shit for being depressed. You know how depressed people react to this: with a rope around their necks hanging on their bedrooms. But this time, I knew how to act. And here’s my advice to anyone, anywhere:

Your friends are your friends. They are not parts of you, well, fuck them. You should talk to everyone, respect everyone, but when it comes to real friendship, don’t trap yourself in some abusive circle. You have so little fucks to give, why throw them all at some creatures who live like social parasites, because if you give them to some asshole

Back to the beginning: Are you happy right now? Yes? Great dude

Are you feeling asocial, just interact more. Get used to rejection, so it doesn’t hurt you anymore. Make new acquaintances, surround yourself with people that you find amusing and you’ll be happy doing what you like with people that you like. And the more people you know, the more you can enjoy! No one is a replica of you, no one will do EVERYTHING you like. By being open to new people, you can go to a bar with some friends, go to a concert with someone else, because there are too many people for you to do that. 

And, the ones that deserve your friendship and that won’t suck the fucks that you shouldn’t be giving out of you. Bonus points: this will make you so confident around your opposite sex, really. You flirt, and s/he shows no interest? Well, 0 fucks given, at least I met someone new. S/He showed interest? Oh man, awesome. 
Use your tools to improve yourself, r/loseit!  Want to broad your knowledge about anything? There will be tons of info about it around Reddit, seek them! You can improve yourself in ways that you can’t even imagine, just ignore that voice in your head that says you can’t. In less time than you expect, people will be admire your confidence, and you won’t even care about that, because you live only for your happiness

The key to not giving a fuck is simply[it can be simple] realizing the truth of your situation. Most people ask ""How do i not give a fuck?"" because they are trying to avoid the hard way which is ACCEPTING the situation that they are facing and taking the necessary steps to CHANGE this situation.


Most people are afraid or too lazy to change so they crave easier ways to change what they want that dont require hard work. Suppose, I'm not good with conversations, I'm too poor etc."", we know that this person is aware of his/her flaws. From here, this person must realize the truth of these situations. If you think you are too fat, then you must CHANGE this. How do you change this? Work Out! Most people are too lazy too work out so they post on howtonotgiveafuck hoping that there is no EASY way to stop giving a fuck that doesn't involve such hard work and commitment. This person must first, Accept that he/she is fat. Next they should make a decision, are the ones who you will find posting on this reddit ""How do I not give a fuck?""

You have to realize that there are no shortcuts to achieving success in what you want. Instead of saying

When you start doing this, don't choose the failing decision. EXample: If you are fat, you have the ability to change this by sucking it up and losing weight. If you say, ""But I dont want to work out"" well then you just chose failure. If you don't want to work out then your only other option is to choose to ACCEPT this since you don't want to change it. Now if you decide that you Don't want to work out and u also cannot accept the fact that you are fat, then you are the cause of your own suffering for choosing to not change it/or accept it.

We have to learn to be able to accept the truth in any situation. Stop looking for an easier way. Stop trying to pretend like you don't know what the truth is. We dread the fact that if we want to get girls then we have to Approach girls

I also want to remind you that I am not the most perfect person in the world and I'm no better than any of you. But I believe that people need to realize and be aware of the brutal truth and stop trying to hide from it and look for easier ways. Everyday it gets easier and easier. I have learned by doing and am becoming closer to a true honey badger each day.

How do i ngaf when everyone asks me why i dropped out?,blahidkwhatimdoing,163,35,63,"I'm a long time lurker and this is one of my first posts ever(this is a throwaway account though). Sorry for its length and if it's confusing or if i'm even posting in the right place.

For the better part of 6 1/2ish years i have been smoking weed just about 24/7. I remain functional and kidded myself about the way it affected me. I was so bad that even when i tried to take breaks from it,  and have never put probably more that 70% of my effort into anything I've done for school. I really have no work ethic towards school work. I planned on trying to stop smoking for school and try to fix 5 years of ignoring everything about school but attending classes. 

Well i really tried to quit about 2 months ago but every time i got stressed i broke down. So i threw away all my smoking devices and realized i have no healthy way of dealing with stress. I break out in a sweat and my heart races and i feel very anxious whenever i even think about the stuff i needed to catch up on at school.

Now i have decided to withdraw from this semester because i wish to see a counselor, and work more. I don't feel i can make up for my 5 years of college where i made no connection with my department or professors in the state I'm in. I still really hope i am making the right decision by withdrawing.

Sorry for how long this is

Now i will be using my time more focused on myself and my family and now i am going to face the questions of why i dropped out from both family and friends after going to college for 5 1/2 years now. And if I'm not going to school why am i not spending more time having fun with my stoner friends (who are going to college or graduated and probably smoke as much or more than i did). How do i not give a fuck? I feel like everyone else can do it, when I feel more capable. 

This is a decision that I hope is right and but every time someone asks why I dropped out and I just say personal reasons it always makes me feel like a failure.
How do i not give a fuck and just help myself? Did withdrawing make me a loser? should i have toughed it out?

TL;DR;
I have trouble with stress and reality from being constantly high or drug for years. Now that I am trying to clean up i realize how reliant i was on such things and how badly I am affected by stress. I now wish better myself and learn how to healthily deal with stress and life. Now I am withdrawing from school after 5 1/2 years and will be asked by family and friends alike why I dropped out after so many years and why I am not partaking in partying with my friends. How do i not give a fuck and just do what i think is right for me? 


edit:Sorry everyone that i haven't gotten on in awhile. all this shit makes me paralyzed sometimes and I'm even frightened to sometimes read these responses. thanks to everyone for your responses though. 

Before i officially dropped out i went to talk to the dude incharge of it and he talked me into just dropping the two classes that i really neglected and doing very bad in and keep trucking through the other ones. He was insanely nice and i felt he genuinely wanted to help me. He help me set up a meeting with a counselor and everything.

1342173192.0,whqpz,One of my NGAF role models: Marcus Aurelius,,124,9,10,"Over the past year I've been reading a lot about Stoicism which has helped me immensely in my quest to become a Honey Badger. The Stoics were all about maximizing happiness and minimizing negative feelings with the ultimate goal of attaining a state of tranquility. My favorite Stoic philosopher was the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius and I thought I'd share some of his thoughts from his writings called '''Meditations''. It's a really great read which is my go-to book for guidance about NGAF and I think there's a lot of stuff in there which this subreddit would love.

**Responding to negative feelings like fear, embarassment and dealing with failure and rejection:**

“If you are distressed by anything external

“Here is a rule to remember in future

“Unhappy am I because this has happened to me.- Not so, because I continue free from pain, neither crushed by the present nor fearing the future.” 

“You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this

“Reject your sense of injury and the injury itself disappears.” 

“If you are pained by external things

The main idea is that while you have no power over certain events which may occur in your life you have complete power over how you respond to them. Feeling sorry for yourself or feeling sad is a choice. Instead choose to be a Honey Badger and continue on like nothing happened and take pride in how you handle adverse situations.

**Not caring about other people:**

“Begin each day by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting with interference, disloyalty, ill-will, and selfishness – all of them due to the offenders’ ignorance of what is good or evil. But for my part I have long perceived the nature of good and its nobility, the nature of evil and its meanness, and also the nature of the culprit himself, who is my brother (not in the physical sense, for nobody can implicate me in what is degrading. Neither can I be angry with my brother or fall foul of him; for he and I were born to work together

""If someone can prove me wrong and show me my mistake in any thought or action

“Or is it your reputation that's bothering you? But look at how soon we're all forgotten. The abyss of endless time that swallows it all. The emptiness of those applauding hands. The people who praise us; how capricious they are

There are so many other great insights in *Meditations* these are just my favorites. I recommend picking up a copy of the book . Also check out [r/Stoicism](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/). And remember Honey Badgers:

""Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself

That's how social scientist Brené Brown defines shame. While I was watching her [TED talk videos](http://www.ted.com/speakers/brene_brown.html)

Watch them. They are humorous and very inspiring:

* [The power of vulnerability](http://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability.html) (TED talk 1)
* [Listening to shame](http://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_listening_to_shame.html) (TED talk 2)
* [The difference between guilt

**Not giving a fuck is not about** having no emotional response to the things that happen to us. We're human beings

**Not giving a fuck *is* about** boldly being vulnerable. Not trying to control, and feel ashamed about yourself because you are imperfect. 

Note that shame is not the same thing as guilt
&gt;Brown: ***""Guilt means 'I made a mistake'

It's not easy to show vulnerability
&gt;Brown: ***“Vulnerability is not weakness. And that myth is profoundly dangerous. Vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage.”***

If you have read my previous [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/19gmrh/a_post_for_fellow_niceguys/), I am grateful.  I will be talking asexually so that both genders reading this will feel serviced; my previous post was directed more toward men.

First thing is first.  I love people with a dark past.  I don't know why.  I  have a very dark past, comes with some risk, and I will lay them out for you by telling you my experience.  I dated a girl named Erin.  She was the grunge-type girl with tattoos, several piercings, and a goth-type appearance.  We were eye to eye on nearly everything.  She had a very dark past, as do I, but we were very different to a third party.  I dress up.  I am always in a polo if not a dress shirt, and you can usually find me in a nice trench-coat during the winter months.  She would dress in leggings, very different people.  However, ladies and gentlemen.  Our relationship ended because of her emotional state

Next, yes, but they must help themselves.  It goes back to feeding a man a fish: if you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day.  If you teach a man to fish, he can feed himself for a lifetime.  The truth is, is that someone in emotional distress **MUST** be able to find a way to cope or bring about internal happiness.  You will be nothing more than a drug.  A temporary high that they will crave and become fixated upon.  This is not healthy for you, nor the recipient of your kindness.  You must not be their crutch, then tell them what they need to hear.  In that order.  After that

Now, they aren't.

* I'm not good enough for anyone.
* Nobody cares about me.
* I'm a loser.
* I should die.
* Life would be so much better if I didn't have to live it.
* I want to drive into oncoming traffic with my hands against the roof of my car.
* I wish someone would start a fight with me
* I am going to get my gun and blow my head off.
* I don't want help because everyone will think I'm a failure.
* I am a failure.
* I have done nothing in my life to help others.

Anyone with social anxiety problems or who makes up millions of 'what-if' scenarios of failure before doing anything

* **Saying ""Yes""**. This is the whole basis of Improv. Saying yes not only pushes you out of your comfort zone but also is an important tool in supporting your scene partner in taking the scene ahead. Removes any negative vibes. It's been the most fun I've ever had. I found myself playing silly games where the 'corporate' me wouldn't have even bothered. I went back to some of the Project Mayhem tasks here and tried the high 5 one again. And this time with more confidence and positive body language at a crowded, I even did an Open Jam. 
* **Listening closely** to your scene partner. In improv there's no script so you have to take cues from your partner's lines, props/object work, etc. to take the scene further. This is the best part because you'll automatically block out any distractions and focus on the key areas of non-verbal communication. Few people in my class even told me that they're introverts and making eye-contact was something a little difficult for them.
* **Just letting go**. The premise of so many of the scenes were so silly but there were no fucks to give. No judgement at all and fuck cares if anyone even judges me. Doing something out of your comfort zone takes some balls (especially when you're sober as fuck). You tell that little judgemental sonofabitch in your head to shut the fuck up.

**I give a fuck whether people think I'm attractive.**

Most people don't find you attractive

**I give a fuck if I'm rejected.**

Why the fuck would you care if someone realizes they're not for you and saves your time by rejecting themselves? Let's say they didn't. Now you're stuck with shitty sex or a relationship with someone who doesn't like you. Are you a fucking idiot?

**I give a fuck that I'm friendzoned.**

Oh shit, they have friends that are like them, but doable. What's wrong with that?

**I give a fuck that I'm in a dry-spell/get laid rarely/am a virgin.**

If you're that concerned about it, you can take a trip to Nevada. For Europeans, Amsterdam is overrated, go to Athens and go fucking crazy. The point is you could be fucking at any time, you just choose not to. You always have options, act like it. If you know this, you don't get desperate. Honey badgers are sexy

**I give a fuck that I can't get laid (or well-laid) when I want to.**



[Absolutely no one can](http://www.thefrisky.com/photos/10-celebs-that-allegedly-got-caught-with-prostitutes/hooker-dangelo-jpg/). If you think there is a person who can have satisfactory sex whenever they want

**I give a fuck that everything is so fake and formulaic.**

You know what you're supposed to do, ""Do you watch Hellsing? It's an anime."" Killed the mood, launched a cool conversation, had mind-blowing sex afterward.

**I give a fuck that my sex sucks.**

Girls get embarassed if they queef after doggy-style or if they fuck up their birth-control and get some blood on someone. Guys get nervous about their performance and it causes them to ejaculate prematurely, and fuck someone who neither gives a fuck. Real sex is not all stoic and dignified, or whatever the hell else our popular mythology says it should be. When two people are completely comfortable with themselves and each other, sex is awesome. You can do some research into how-to-sex, but everyone is different and the first time will never be the best time you have sex with that person. Have fun experimenting. Don't be afraid of asking for what you want, and don't judge your partner if they do. If someone says no, it probably won't ruin anything (bdsm and certain fantasies should be discussed beforehand, if you have to convince someone to have sex with you

**I give a fuck that I haven't found love.**

Stop fucking looking for it. It's not something that you can conciously develop. It's a force that comes out of nowhere and fundamentally fucks with your life. It doesn't make sense, though. It's like a creeper from minecraft: you don't have to look for it, it finds you and fucks your plans up. Knowing this, why fucking worry about it? Just do what you love, and then love pops in. If it never does, you were doing what you love your whole life.

**I give a fuck that I lost my love.**

Ok, you know what I'm talking about. It's a force of nature that can and will destroy you. The best you can do is damage control. If you think that going into a year long depression is some weakness that you should hide, stop giving a fuck. People who have been through it will understand. Break down, there are few pains worse. Don't let it eat you alive from the inside. Be honest about it, and find out that your close friends have been through the same thing. I was embarassed that my life was (temporarily) wrecked by someone I was in love with for two days, and my subsequent chasing her around the country and world for a year because I would not get it that she didn't return my feelings. Now I don't give a fuck. I did that, and I'm not as unpenetrable as I thought I was. I live with it and it's made life a lot easier. I frowned and got blurry-eyed typing that out and I'm not afraid to let anyone know.

I'm starting to realize that I'm not experiencing life for myself most of the time and I live and breathe for the social acceptance of friends...and even strangers.

I've been told many different times and in many different situations how witty, there are times where I am completely enveloped in this cloud of self doubt and anxiety - destroying my social ability to communicate.  Even with friends I've known for years.  This feeling, this...mental state makes me feel so insecure and uncomfortable in my very own skin.  I start to stumble over words and trying to say something relevant to the conversation becomes impossible.  The words I speak feel ""false"" as they leave my lips.  It's a combination of what I say and how I say it....and I'm sorry that I can't express the emotion in a different way.  I all around feel like a shitty socially awkward human being when I am experiencing this mental state.

This event triggers occasionally - around every two weeks or so.  I start to dwell things.  I start to question myself about things that I rationally know are true.  Suddenly

Maybe I'm so concerned about how others feel about me all the time that my self doubts become a reality?  A self fulfilling prophecy where if I think I'm a certain way then I become it? Maybe I just need to not give a fuck so much about entertaining other people and just be comfortable for myself?

1362640788.0,19u1p0,Giving less fucks,dontwriteit,121,23,29,"Hey ya'll


I'm 24. I work at Starbucks (I.E. I don't make much money). I am pretty average looking - on my best day

Last summer, it's not my fault. With this perspective I grew confident, and I slept with three different girls, got a  B.J. from another, and made out with probably a dozen at bars. Girl-wise, it was a good summer. But most importantly, I found out, exactly what it is I want to do with my life.

Okay,from bar to bar meeting people, and doing our thing. I should let you know, that I had like $2.50 on me, and that’s it. I was pretty much flat broke. In the past this would have crippled me. I’d have had stupid thoughts, like, *“fuck I can't even buy her a beer, woah is me

We start the night getting into a rhythm: walking along the streets, and trying to take it all in.

The first bar we settle on has a smoking hot bartender. 8/10

I opened a conversation with her, we need a pretty drummer. Be in my band."" 

She smiled and asked me about what kind of band I'm in. I shot the shit with her, we just stand on stage looking pretty. We had a few laughs, and cracked some jokes back and forth. It was a very fine conversation. Finally, I spent my only money on a PBR, and she left to help her other customers.

After I finished my beer, I was only trying to keep up the fun, comical, rapport we had built. To my surprise she loved it. She laughed, and grabbed me a beer (of course, she didn't take the Powerbar). 

So I drank my beer, and my buddy told me he's going to ask for her number. Him and I had a short conversation that went somewhat like this:

""Oh yeah? You're gonna get her number?"" I asked  him.

""Yeah

""If you need a line

I waved at the bartender, and simply asked her, ""Can I have your phone number?"" She gave me a bit of suspecting look, and asked me why I wanted it.

""To call you."" I said, or tone of voice.

I didn't call her, four days after. She didn't respond. I fucked up. Oh well, I can always go back and try again, or get more numbers. There's always more people to meet.

Something I always tell myself is, and deciding that the best way to convey information is to simply say things as simply as you know how. Don’t think about what you’re going to say, think about what you are hoping to convey. The words will come on their own if you’re being honest enough. 

Of course, again, to give more fucks than I'd like, but it's not about being perfect. It's about improving your life and being a happier, more positive individual. Nothing good ever comes without effort, but once it comes, it doesn't ever fully get away. Remember to keep your head up, good or bad.

Let’s define “giving a fuck” (GAF) as an uncontrolled emotional response to external stimulus that is a function of both time and brain power (energy). A common example: you get rejected by a girl and you feel like shit

The value of giving a fuck:
Let’s define all instances of GAF (numbered 1,n) to hold a value -1&lt;=Fn&lt;=1, such that all Fn&lt;0 are negative instances of GAF, all Fn&gt;0 are positive instances of GAF and Fn=0 implies you do not GAF.

Theorem: You are limited in your ability to GAF.
For proof, and would be unable to perform basic human functions.

Let’s express this by saying the sum of the absolute value (positive distance from zero) of all instances of GAF (F1,Fn) for an individual is such that 0&lt;=SUM&lt;=1. At 1 you GAF about a lot of stuff, and at 0 you have reached not giving a fuck. Your positive GAF (+GAF) does not cancel out your negative GAF (-GAF). You can GAF about + and - stimuli at the same time, but you are still limited in the total amount you can GAF. 

Define the vector (Smile

Define %Smile to the the portion of SUM which is derived from +GAF and %Frown to be the portion derived from -GAF.

What do we mean when we say “to not give a fuck”? The corner cases for (Smile

(0

(1

(0

If we take the title “How to not give a fuck” in the most literal way, let’s apply a basic utility function such that: Utility=Smile+Frown
The solution that gives us the maximum value for Utility is (1

Put all of this together and look at the greater implication.
What if your goal in life was not to forget about the bad shit

If you truly do not want to give a fuck about all the shit in your life, SO, hobbies, work, school and start giving a fuck about all of them. Give your fucks freely and generously, but make sure they are good fucks and that they are directed at the things and people worthy of them. Don’t waste your fucks on the bullshit that life throws at you. The more time and energy you waste fucking around in the corner wondering why you got rejected, then the less you will GAF about all those great things you have in your life. 

Many of the posts here seem to ask the same question ""How do I stop giving a fuck about....?"" It struck me that we have a very negatively defined view on the world if the only focus is to try to NGAF about stuff that seems to bother us. It seemed silly and ridiculous to me to narrowly define the world in such a way. Don't get me wrong

Think of something you regret.  It can be small, consider repeating it with friends and/or strangers until you realize its insignificance.  If it is big, apologize for it.  This may involve apologizing to yourself.  Don't forget to treat yourself the way you believe others should be treated.  Use discretion with this one.

I read from a book recently that I felt very appropriately described four words.  The words: regret, and guilt.  Guilt was described as a form of self torture; an inappropriate use of regret.  Anxiety was similarly described as an inappropriate use of fear.  Fear and regret can be used in very positive ways.  They are tools to help us be better people.  Taken to an unhealthy level, they become forms of self torture that are not in any way fair treatment of ourselves.

Firstly, and my dog Tom. I'm just finishing the last year of A-levels (the year before university). I'm mad crazy about birds, and biology in general. I love metal.

My life is going pretty good

But I used to suffer from depression. For about 3 years my life felt like a ship's anchor that had come loose in a stormy night

* Being generally more intelligent than other people. This cut me off from a lot of 'acceptable' interactions and...
* ...meant that I had very different interests and aspirations from other people. I love birds. I mean
* Personal relations have always been difficult. I'm a friendly guy, but because I found it hard to fully relax

So this carried on until December last year. Which is when I realised that not giving a fuck is singularly the most freeing philosophy. 

It was at the interviews for Oxford and I met a girl who was also applying for Biology. We got talking and we really hit it off. It was like we had known each other far, that people are very rarely genuine, or honest, or open. 

I realise that I found that happiness because I stopped giving a fuck. I stopped holding myself back. I let my own self come to the fore. There is so much said about dancing, and that is because that is what it feels like to not care, to be free. The girl I met was a mirror in which I saw my reflection and danced with it.

Since then, or self-doubt. My mum (a very wise woman) said herself the other day ""You know you're greatest strength? You just don't give a shit about what people think"". And I thought, yeah, maybe it is.

Now, and would recommend to others:

* Laugh. At anything you feel like. Find humour and joy in everything you encounter. Laugh at yourself. 
* Be honest. I'm not talking about simply ""don't tell lies"". Being honest is about opening your heart to and for people. Denying what you feel, and what you think. There is so much restriction, so much repression of feeling that, if you let them free, you become someone people admire.
* Do stuff you think you won't like. This has been great. It comes in with a spontaneity thing, just don't do it again. But if you do...well, there's something else entirely
* Read. You're not so alone
* Write. Putting down thoughts, and realise that it's really manageable. I've found even writing fiction is enjoyable. It doesn't have to be any good, just that it's your's.
* For God's sake go outside. Not just to the shop, but just go out. Nature is one thing in which the day-to-day problems of being fade away, and make you mindful of the living world around you. An hour's walk is like meditation.
* Care about stuff that matters, because a lot of things genuinely matter, because they go beyond yourself. But with things that directly, individually concern you - don't worry. Whatever happens, you will be happy, because you don't mind the outcome.

Anyway

*And would it have been worth it

*After the cups,*

*Among the porcelain

*Would it have been worth while

*To have bitten off the matter with a smile

*To have squeezed the universe into a ball*

*To roll it toward some overwhelming question*

Yes

Longer Version: You are going to die

The scariest part about our brain is the lengths it goes to in protecting itself from losing things.  When your brain goes into a mode of protection, instead of protection from loss, then you start to give a lot less fucks.  So how do we stay away from going into protection/prevention mode?

This brings us right back to realizing the fact that we will die, or at the very least we will lose it all when we die.  Every friendship, every job, every random attractive person we see in the street - at some point we will lose our relationship with that person/thing.  There is no permanence to any of it, and yet our brain wants to make decisions like there is.  Recognize the truth, and you will start to see that giving a fuck is actually something reserved for your decisions for yourself and what is truly important to you.  I hope this finds you in good health and that you found use in it!  If not, well, *I don't give a fuck*.

**Perspective**

Everything about this philosophy is centered on perspective; how your mind sees and interprets life. If you aren't happy with your current perspective

That being said, comes victory.

**More Overview**

Think of this logically. Attachment causes care. Attachment causes desire and dependence. The idea of attachment is the opposite of what not giving a fuck is about. The very idea implies that if you lost that thing you are attached to, thing, or idea should represent your happiness. You represent your happiness. Your perception and mindset represent your happiness.

**Taking Yourself Too Seriously**

1348875989.0,10n8j8,How to not give a fuck about being forever-alone. ,IronOhki,112,30,38,"So

The perception: You don't have a girlfriend and never will. Everyone else seems to have all the happiness and love. You have nothing and will die repulsive and alone. 

The actual problem: You want two things

* 1) You want female companionship. 
* 2) You want sex. 

These are both normal human pursuits. The fallacy is you're looking for both at once.

**Solution to #1: Companionship**

Deliberately friendzone a girl. 

You might not have a lot of friends. You might have friends but they're all guys. You are thinking of girls as (Compantionship + Sex) only. That's fine and normal

Consider you find yourself in a conversation with a girl. You've got three or four things in common but she's seeing someone. **HONEY BADGER MODE: ENGAGE. Friendzone her immediately.**

Suddenly

PRO TIP: DO NOT USE THIS AS A CHANCE TO COMPLAIN. The allure of this instinct is strong. Do not fall for it. **No human wants to hear another human complain.** You have a friend

PRO TIP: DON'T FREAK OUT ABOUT BEING FRIENDZONED. This does not mean you are repulsive

Your new ally is likely have social circles of her own. She will likely have great ideas for stuff to get you out of the house and around new people. Some of these people will likely be girls. Once you realize you're being social around girls, and you will be giving far, far fewer fucks. 

**Solution to #2: Sex**

Now that you're giving fewer fucks about limiting yourself to that one idealized *perfect happily-ever-after true love forever* relationship

* 1) Fuck some bitch you don't care about. 
* 2) Fap.

The addition of this subreddits mindset and some added philosophical mindfulness have really made me at peace with who I am (there's no one in the world I would change lives with). 

Recently this pretty cute girl got hired at the place I work. She's kinda the quirky type; short dark hair, likes internet memes and is always really pleasant to everyone. I've always dated more conventional girls so something about her struck me and I decided that she would be an awesome person to come home to at the end of the day. It's a pretty big place with lots of employees so we maybe chatted 5-10 times while she served me food or we had the same break. We never got into any real meaningful conversation or anything and so I set up a bunch of plans in order to show how interesting my life is and how fun I can be (I tend to think of myself as an average looking dude so I don't wheel on looks usually). So about a full week passes where neither of us work the same shift which is pretty unusual and I'm getting a little more motivated to close next time I see her. Eventually I look on the employee sheet and she's working later in the day so I decide that now is the time. I head on break and she's working at the food area so I head up to her cash and start some small-talk with the intention of leading the conversation to my business and eventually maybe hanging out. I ask her about her day and am ready to reply and run my game when all of a sudden she stops and says ""You know, we should really hang out some time."" I was pretty blown away. I say that sounds good and she asks if it's alright to give me her number :) It's pretty rare for a girl in my league to ask me out or be so forward without even knowing one another; let alone one I was already very interested in. It feels good to have all the hard work pay off, I remember even a month ago being frustrated that I didn't yet have the girlfriend I always wanted. Now I have a business with a good interesting buddy, have a group of friends to hang out with anytime and say anything to, have an awesome interesting girlfriend and a shit load of confidence and self assuredness that is leading to respect from everyone.

I've always had self esteem issues. I'm a pretty outgoing guy, and I'm very happy for that. 

But I have never been able to get anywhere with anyone of the opposite sex. I honestly have no idea what is wrong with me; it's been like this ever since middle school and now that I'm partway through college still holding onto my v-card, show affection, and whenever I try to say something affectionate it either gets brushed off as a joke, the girl pauses and says ""oookayyyy"" or instantly distances herself away from me. Hell girls hardly ever text me unless it's for casual shit or they need something. 

And here's the elephant in the room:

I have a 4 inch penis. 3.5 inches in fact when I'm standing up because I'm a bit chubby above the crotch area, still rocking only 3 inches. I used to be a swimmer, so slip ups would often occur and I was constantly reminded how small my penis was. Even when my friends make small penis jokes at me or about people, I always laugh it off like I'm one of them. I don't feel normal. It scares me that one day I'm (hopefully) going to end up with someone I like, and I'll be too scared to take off my pants. People are always like ""oh no, size doesn't matter"" but it's still a mental stigma that I have a whole lot of trouble getting over. I feel like this holds me back at parties and such when I try to go and talk to girls.

Today something compelled me to run after work. I knew it was going to be dark when I got back home but it was just eating at me to get my shoes on and head out. This is what happened:

While driving, played with the dog for a bit, got ready to run and headed out. I usually run on the same street that I take on my way back from work and, to my surprise the van was still on the side of the road. This is about 20 to 30 minutes after I drove by it! Now, I know this is suburbia and not many people are out and about on foot, so I was not very surprised that no one had walked by and helped. However, this was during rush hour, the van was on the farthest right lane, I noticed that the van was half full inside, there were four people helping out this single man who had found himself alone with a bit of car trouble. Finally

For the rest of my run I keep thinking about this. Seeing everyone help out was great. We all have it in us. We need to learn how to reach out to those than need it even when they don't ask for it. We need to learn how to be good to one another. At least 20 minutes passed while the man was on the side of the road. How much longer would he have been there if I had decided to watch a movie or play video games with my roommate? I don’t know. Maybe until the guy with the car stopped by. But maybe not. Maybe it was seeing someone helping out that gave him the push to stop and give us a hand as well. Maybe sometimes we need to see someone doing the right thing for us to join them. “Someone else will help” is not the right attitude, maybe no one else will; but if you do, others will join you. There is so much we can do for one another. From the smallest little gestures to the biggest generosities, it all helps. Love is all we have, so share it with everyone because we all need it.

I suggested to my goofy, but begged me to let him hide his face under his hood. I told him that was bitch-mode, and he eventually obliged. After working up his courage for a few minutes, he said fuck it and we got up.

Walking out there felt like walking to the guillotine, and all feeling of caring what people thought about me vanished. I started acting a fool; clapping my hands, doing [The Carlton] (http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lt4djiyO7k1qbymhco1_r4_250.gif), and doing a little dance me and my friend worked on earlier that night for the gay club.

A few seconds into it, laughing, and having a good time with the entertainment. My other 2 friends that stood by and gave a fuck were laughing their asses off and signalling us to head out as we swaggered off the dance floor.

As we were walking out of the club, and asked ""What the hell, (*wipes tears from eyes*), were you guys doing out there!?"" and invites me and my dance partner to sit with all of the people he was there with and made introductions with us, the 2 party-starters. As we walked to his table, we noticed there were actually people out there dancing now (I guess we inspired people to also NGAF).

Anyway I'll admit it doesn't relate to not giving a fuck in the sense you'd think.  Well it does, even if it means you initially care about things you don't want to.  If that's the case and you find yourself caring about something totally lame, go ahead and be honest and say, ""Hey I care about this.""  It sounds counterproductive but the more important aspect of early-phase HTNGaF is *not* actually pretending to not give a fuck but being honest with yourself and others and speaking up when you want something.  Then after a while when you start to feel comfortable with standing up for what you believe in and gain confidence.  And when you gain confidence in yourself, you begin to see that a lot of what you wanted wasn't a specific outcome but just to have things done your way/get attention/be heard/etc.  And **that's** when you see your inner Honey Badger come out.

The author explains it better than I do so I'll shut up now.  Anyway, weakness, an obligation to ""nice"" behavior, not putting your own needs first, etc.  Just read the first few pages and if you're like me you'll freak the fuck out at how accurate it is and be hooked.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did cause if so there's going to be an fuck-giving *deficit* from here on out. :-)

1340885712.0,vqjor,Going to concerts alone.,drilldozerbaggins,89,16,58,"My special people

I wanted to share some philosophies that I recognized by going to an electronic music event in a foreign country by myself last night.  I am an avid concert goer and I came to some neat realizations from this experience.  I shall now lay down a few points and what i learned from it:

* First, I've been to many events like this before, so it helped, but even then you must let go of the fucks and be at the mercy of the naturally-occurring.

* Be yourself.  That is the most important thing.  If you care about what other people are thinking of you, then put that whole notion aside and just be yourself -- it's much more effective.  You'd be surprised how positively people react.  If they react poorly, then fuck them and it was not meant to be.

* Let go of your expectations.  Live in the present moment and enjoy *the hell out of it*, or whatever, but you never know what is coming next.  I met so many friendly people from diverse backgrounds and it was exhilarating, but I had the expectation that I'd show up, watch, dance, and leave.  This was far from the case.

* As mentioned a bit before, because you have more mental capacity to just observe your surroundings and your thoughts about it rather than having your attention on the group you came with.  My advice is that if you lose your friends at a concert, don't spend time looking for them, because you'll find them eventually.  Take that alone time to explore, dance, and maybe even make a few human connections. 

This can be summed up, that when I drive myself my light is found""*

All four of us live in a two bedroom house. I sleep on a couch. My father was never a part of my life.

I used to give so many fucks. I was cutting, and I dragged it on for too long. A year and a week, to be exact. I didn't have any friends because I was always scared to talk to people. I couldn't even fucking call and order pizza because I was so self conscious.

How to Not Give a Fuck

*	Those that mind don’t matter

*	The lion does not concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.

*	Quit caring about people who aren’t going to come to your funeral.

*	Trying to change what you cannot is about as productive as trying to move a building with your bare hands.

*	Worrying about something you cannot change is a waste of your potential.

*	Everything is the way it is because everything was the way it was.

*	You shouldn’t try to change them

*	You cannot change the hand you are dealt

*	Say yes to good things (and say no to bad things).

*	Tell that little judgmental son of a bitch in your head to shut the fuck up.

*	Make the best out of every situation.

*	It’s about how you see yourself

*	You have to cut out the noise because the world is full of a lot of it.

*	Don’t take things personally.

*	Just let go!

Thank you r/howtonotgiveafuck

I use to be really subconscious about what others thought about me, and was inspired to try and change my life.  This is my success story, hopefully it inspires others in return.

To start we find ourselves in Europe, the program was 50 people with 9 guys).  As the trip wore on I started to fall for one of the girls in my group of friends.  This is where the first minor step occurs, as she had a boyfriend back in the Canada.  I decided I didn't really give a fuck, and I was going to just keep on keepin' on, and this was the first step 
towards greatness.

The second step begins during one of the many shopping excursions I found myself dragged along.  They were shopping for swimsuits and then decided that it would be *hilarious* if I were to wear a speedo.  Now, super skinny, super pale, and I had a stark lack of body hair due to some native american influences, also I was a bit worried about the lack of coverage a speedo provided for my shnoiklers.  After a bit of coaxing on their part, I went into the changing rooms to find the size that would fit.  I looked myself in the eye, asked myself

The second step finishes about 3 days later, my pale white skin glowing like a firefly at midnight, I had to not give a fuck... there was simply no other option.  I ended up having a great time and gained a whole new level of self confidence that has utterly changed my life.  But that is not even the best part, that girl I mentioned earlier, with that boyfriend back in the Canada?  She broke up with him, and now she is reciprocating (woah, 
big word) those feelings of mine.

tl;dr - **wore a speedo to force myself to not give a fuck

*Disclaimer - she did NOT break up because of me

It's always annoying when this happens and if one were to give a fuck, the conversation ends and i'm a little annoyed at her lack of a response. Is she ignoring me? Does she just not like me? What's going on?

A couple of days later she updates her profile with some information on what was going on. Does anybody care to take a guess at what it was? In a very M. Night Shyamalan-esque fashion:

She was in Kenya. Out of all the places in the world and things she could have been doing

1358978731.0,175dmq,How to stop giving a fuck when it is difficult - letting go of attachment,thatisyou,73,6,25,"One problem with NGAF I've found, we get angry

What to do then?

One way to think about this is to use the Buddhist idea of ""Attachments"".  Attachments are things that cause us to spin in circles when we try too hard to push them outside our mind.

For example, but if every time someone cuts me off , I still think ""fuck that asshole"" - in this case, I still have an attachment.  

Another example is if I broke up with my girlfriend, talking to other people about her, but she's still in my thoughts, I am still attached to her (and still give a fuck about her).  

So by this line of thinking - how can I let go of my attachments - and therefore stop *really* giving a fuck?  The answer is to just let the thoughts be.  Let it lie.  You don't continue to give a fuck

For instance, and want to forget about her, but I'm still thinking about her, I just observe that thought.  I observe ""I want to forget about my ex-girlfriend, but I am still thinking of her.  That's fine, it is what it is.  Eventually I'll stop thinking about her.""

The point with attachments, it often makes us frustrated.  And then the frustration makes us upset.  And it gnaws at us.

When we can step back from it, I'm still thinking about my ex, but that's ok, it's natural, it is what it is, and eventually over time it will go away."" - then we don't make our mind go around in circles.  And naturally we will find that the thoughts stop having power over us, and start to diminish in our minds.  That's when we are no longer ""attached"" to the thoughts,,False,t3_175dmq

A Gift for My Daughter

by Harry Browne

December 25

(This article was originally published as a syndicated newspaper column

It’s Christmas and I have the usual problem of deciding what to give you. I know you might enjoy many things — books

But I’m very selfish. I want to give you something that will stay with you for more than a few months or years. I want to give you a gift that might remind you of me every Christmas.

If I could give you just one thing

The truth is simply this:

No one owes you anything.

Significance

How could such a simple statement be important? It may not seem so

No one owes you anything.

It means that no one else is living for you

When you realize that no one owes you happiness or anything else

It means no one has to love you. If someone loves you

When people do things for you, give them something meaningful that makes them want to please you, not because anyone owes you anything.

No one has to like you. If your friends want to be with you

No one has to respect you. Some people may even be unkind to you. But once you realize that people don’t have to be good to you

Living your Life

No one owes you anything.

You owe it to yourself to be the best person possible. Because if you are

Some people will choose not to be with you for reasons that have nothing to do with you. When that happens

Once you learn that you must earn the love and respect of others

If they do, the property you’ve earned. But don’t ever take them for granted. If you do, you could lose them. They’re not yours by right; you must always earn them.

My Experience

A great burden was lifted from my shoulders the day I realized that no one owes me anything. For so long as I’d thought there were things I was entitled to

No one owes me moral conduct, love, courtesy, or intelligence. And once I recognized that, all my relationships became far more satisfying. I’ve focused on being with people who want to do the things I want them to do.

That understanding has served me well with friends, sales prospects, and strangers. It constantly reminds me that I can get what I want only if I can enter the other person’s world. I must try to understand how he thinks, what he believes to be important, what he wants. Only then can I appeal to someone in ways that will bring me what I want.

And only then can I tell whether I really want to be involved with someone. And I can save the important relationships for those with whom I have the most in common.

It’s not easy to sum up in a few words what has taken me years to learn. But maybe if you re-read this gift each Christmas

I hope so,False,,t5_2tna8,False,revelation,,t3_1jd51r

So I begin to dole out the life advice.

""Yea""

""Well let me tell you the most important thing about HS.""

*kids lean in in anticipation*

""It doesn't mean a fucking thing.""

at this point they laugh. so I interrupt them.

""Not joking...I mean yea, nothing that happened then matters now aside from the fact that some of my friends from them are still my friends today. All the petty drama, the social nightmare, the bullshit feelings, the insecurity, etc...does. not. mean. a fucking. thing.""

*""Really?"" They ask (Well one asked

""Absolutely...I can't even begin to think about all the bullshit that occupied so much of my time that I can't even remember...as much sense as that makes.""

""And let me tell you about college.""

*""what about it?""*

""Hardly means a fucking thing. Yea you definitely need this to get ahead, but all the cliquey bullshit, the drama, the girls, the emotional insecurity, etc, etc...meaningless...Today

*""whoa really?""*

""Yep...and shit, but beyond the necessities, a majority of the bullshit in life does not matter...avoid it if you can...and definitely try your hardest to use your mind over your emotions.""

**I continued here doling out my philosophy about dealing with problems**

""Also, dumped, sickness in the family, anything that pretty much happened...try your hardest not to let emotions take over and sit there pouting and crying and stressing and altogether not doing a damn thing to solve your problem and just say to yourself, verbally or mentally. ***'well THAT has happened...so now that that has happened, what can I do to fix whatever happened.'*** Bitching and moaning doesn't solve a thing. Action does...and a majority of life is forgotten so try not to sweat the bullshit.""

""You began dying the second you were born

At this point they were already finished eating for like 5-10 minutes now just listening to me speak...they cleaned up and as they left thanked me for the advice.

I'm not sure how much will actually stick with a 12/13 year old...but hopefully I gave these kids some life advice that will help them in the future.

I dated her once in May 2012, I became disenchanted with dating and started to look inward into the problem. It was me. So, I joined /r/seduction, absorbed everything they had, and started going about fixing myself. By the end of summer, I found myself in a relationship. 

It wasn't a great relationship by any means. She was young and idealistic, we'd reached an impasse and the whole thing exploded.

By then, we were hanging out more and more, and eventually she broke up with her boyfriend. 

I thought literally nothing of it, me and her friend left.

The next day after sending me this long letter that her date sent her about his grievances with her

I wish I could say I was indifferent to it

After assuring her it wasn't weird

Here's where it gets super shitty.

I texted her to see if she would still be on for Sunday, Tuesday it is. Whoops, no, gotta cancel. By this time, I knew she was leaving for Spring Break, so I was ready to just let it go altogether, so I told her so. No, no. We'll do it when I get back. I felt myself seething with anger
She then begins the process called the [fade away](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr8HKRTavM0).

2. Just for today I will try to adjust myself to what is, and my luck as they come and fit myself to them.

3. Just for today I will take care of my body.  I will exercise it, not abuse it nor neglect it, so that it will be a perfect machine for my bidding.

4. Just for today I will try to strengthen my mind.  I will learn something useful.  I will not be a mental loafer.  I will read something that requires effort

5. Just for today I will exercise my soul in three ways; I will do somebody a good turn and not get found out.  I will do at least two things I don't want to do

6. Just for today I will be agreeable.  I will look as well as I can, act courteously, be liberal with praise, criticize not at all, nor find fault with anything and not try to regulate nor improve anyone.

7. Just for today I will try to live through this day only

8. Just for today I will have a program.  I will write down what I expect to do every hour.  I may not follow it exactly

9. Just for today I will have a quiet half-hour all by myself and relax.  In this half-hour sometimes I will think of God

10. Just for today I will be unafraid, to love, and to believe that those I love, love me.

/r/meditation - Meditation alone will change entirely the amount of fucks you give in daily life.  You can view your fucks as attention.  Whatever your attention is on you're giving fucks about.  Meditation helps you train this attention so you can actually choose to shift your focus from things like outward appearance, friends, goals and so on.  Once you start, you'll realize just how little control you had over your focus before.  Look at all the yogis and gurus in india that practice hours of meditation a day.  You think they give a single fuck what anyone thinks? They're in a constant state of bliss, acceptance and indifference.  Along with helping you give less fucks other benefits include increased focus, clarity, happiness, insightful and very willing to help newcomers and answer any questions you may have about meditation. Meditation has completely changed mine and many others lives so don't knock it until you try it.  

/r/nofap - Nofap is the ultimate challenge of willpower that is giving up the habit of masturbation.  Why would anyone do this you ask? Because of the undeniably rewarding benefits like increased confidence,000 other fapstronauts can attest to this.  It's no cakewalk though.  You will be hornier than you've ever felt before and realize just how addicting porn really is.  I've been subscribed to nofap for around 8 months and my longest streak is only 23 days.  But I'm currently holding a 21 day streak and I feel fucking awesome! Despite the negative stimga surrounding /r/nofap I find that a lot of the members are very down to earth and supportive.

Step one. Try really fucking hard. Pretend. Fake it. Oh

Your life is a gold-pan. Shake the fuck out of it, just do your thing and wait for everybody else to catch up.

1337883146.0,u33u9,My first IDGAF moment as an adult,keypuncher,59,1,6,"This happened nearly 10 years ago

I had lost my job, then nothing.  When would call, they'd 'hired someone more qualified'.  During this time, I lost my house, my car, my investments, my savings - basically everything I owned.  I worked odd jobs, whatever it took to make ends meet

Naturally this meant calls from bill collectors.  And letters.  And more calls.  Sometimes the calls were pretty bad.  They'd get really pushy and try anything to get me to come up with money I didn't have

It got bad enough that when a local lawyer advertised a free 1 hr consultation, and I had nothing to protect.

I went home and thought about that - and I realized that the reason those bill collectors had been able to be abusive is because I let them.  ...and I let them because I gave a fuck about trying to repay the debt, and my credit rating already ruined, I realized *there was nothing they could do to me*.  Sure, they could sue, but I had no money, no assets and no prospects of that changing - so all suing was going to do was cost them money.

It was incredibly liberating the next time one of the abusive bill collectors called and got abusive

I eventually got the records thing cleared up (once I found out about it)

Yes I'm a crazy person. No I don't have a death wish. And of course there's *some* kind of hypothesis at work

I guess you could say that the end goal here is a fresh understanding of both suffering and gratitude. Not that I'm looking forward to the suffering aspect of it all, while other people are buying electronic rectangles for their obese 10 year olds that cost more than 6 months of rations. It was chance alone that put me in a place where I could observe the latter, instead of being a nameless victim of the former.

So yeah

*Side note ~ minor things like the fap limit, it's also a stripping of my modernised, apathetic lifestyle. So basically, I'm curious to see how I'll fair without the perks.*

Alright, lost 28 so far, well on my way to my weight loss goal). That being said, I've always been very insecure and self conscious.  I still have my V-Card and it has bothered me until these past 3 months that I have been going out.  Anyways, I've always enjoyed the club scene as I am a huge fan of EDM.  Not the best location for approaching the ladies but I figured it would be a good place to start - giving me a good challenge.  I have been a frequent patron of this club and the staff all know me because initially I was ""That Guy"" that hung out in the corner watching. They worked on getting me out of my shell and I became more open. Yes, I was a creeper all due to my awkwardness and social retardation at the beginning.  I had opened up a bit but I still had approach anxiety and was still very self conscious. Hell, I was still awkward with hugs to be honest

Now we move to this past Saturday night.  There were ladies everywhere. Don't know what was special about this night but there were countless more an usual.  I approached 2 that I found attractive and seemed cool, everyone else was in a group and I figured the night was over as far as chances are concerned.  Music was blaring, and I figured well, I might as well enjoy myself while I'm here.  I began to dance to the music, by myself.  Now whenever I had danced before but it wasn't much. It was fun but I always felt awkward and self conscious.  Well, this past Saturday night I decided, I don't give a fuck.  I came to the realization that I am here to have a good time and if anyone else stares, whatever - that's their deal.  I started going at it, everyone on the floor had noticed me and started dancing with me.  The ladies were all over me.  I had never ""grinded"" until that point, having a blast.  I can honestly say it was the best time of my life.

Out of this experience, I had my first kiss with a girl.  Yes, cheesy but I had never kissed anyone before.  She was an 8 - gorgeous brunette.  Final count: 5 phone numbers and 1 kiss.
