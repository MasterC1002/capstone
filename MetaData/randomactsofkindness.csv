I don't care for these posts of videogames you want just because your allowance doesn't cut it this month. You got everything you fucking need

Same goes with other things. We all want stuff. I get it. Getting free stuff is great. But there's a difference wanting stuff because you are materialistic and impatient

I dunno. I just see all these requests and what it says in the side bar, it's ridiculous.

We have only been at the zoo for less than an hour when it starts to sprinkle.  No big deal I think, and it starts steadily raining harder.  By the time we get to the parking lot, it is pouring the rain, which is too much for my little umbrella, so all three of us are getting wet.

I was able to get my daughter in the car, but then I'm struggling to get him out of the carrier since I need both hands to pull him out. 

 Let me mention that at this point a young blonde lady had run from the zoo entrance to her car sans umbrella, in the absolute pouring rain, without an umbrella to ask if I need any help.

  Today I was driving through a residential neighborhood in another city and I saw a little boy - probably about 7 - sitting at a table with his hands folded, and went right up to his table. His little sister - maybe 4 - had toys set up too. I bought one item from her, and she took my dollar with an enormous grin and ran to her dad, waving it in the air and bursting with excitement. I carefully went through the boy's toys next and bought something from him as well.

  

  I don't need a digital watch shaped like Gary the Snail, because you don't either. I'm asking you, if you ever see a child selling their toys in front of their house - don't keep driving. You will make their day if you buy just one little thing, and that dollar will mean much more to them than it likely would to you. It would be very kind indeed.

Today I was taking two cats to be neutered at the Anti-Cruelty Society (I live in Chicago). I dropped them off this morning and as I was on my way back home, and by the time I got back home was on the verge of an anxiety attack (the last time I was involved in a car accident, I was left unable to walk properly or move my neck and arms for weeks.) 

When the time came for me to pick the cats up after their surgery

A lady casually asked about the carrier, helped me maneuver with the carrier and even helped squeeze us onto a train. She ended up living in my neighborhood and she not only kept me company and helped me get the kitties safely home, but also delayed her OWN commute home just to help me, a complete stranger, get home too.

I barely made it home before I cried. I don't even know how to react, that having a stranger go so much out of her way to help me and make my day so much brighter like that isn't even something I can comprehend. It melted away a lot of the anger and hurt from my accident this morning and restored my faith in humanity just that bit.

After my art final today, I couldn't find my car anywhere. Alexis and I searched all five floors with no luck. Instead of panicking about it, I decided to ask the parking security guy to help me look. After about ten minutes we concluded that it was definitely not there. So, he calls to see if it has been towed. It has. They claimed that I did not pay my parking tickets. I'm pretty sure I did but that's beside the point. The school parking people sent over someone to explain to me how to get my car back. Let's say his name was John. 

For whatever reason, or how I was going to get to the towing company to get my car back. John obviously didn't give a fuck and actually *laughed at me* when I started to cry. That's when the parking security guy steps in to the conversation again. I can't say his name because I think he could get in trouble for this, so let's call him Adam. Adam starts asking John (who is his immediate superior) if it would be okay for him to drive me and Alexis to get my car. John keeps telling him, ""It's a liability. You're on the clock. No you can't."" but Adam is not hearing it. He finally asks, ""Well can I take my dinner break, then?"" and John agrees. 

Adam then proceeds to go get his car so he could drive two perfect strangers twenty minutes to the towing company. On his dinner break. He even brought me to the bank so I could get cash to get my car back. We even had to go to a second bank because I reached my withdraw limit. He talked with us about basketball and our majors during the whole ride there. He told me about the time he got his car towed. He even gave me his number just in case things didn't work out at the towing company and we needed a ride back. And he didn't ask for anything in return,,False,self,t5_2rl0v,False,,True

I bought a car out in Vermont (I'm from Minnesota) so I hopped on a plane, like most people, don't enjoy obeying the speed limit. So somewhere about halfway through Ohio I came up to a pair of truckers who are going about 65 miles per hour, side by side on the interstate. The speed limit in that area is 70 so I was a little upset because I was going a bit over 80 with my cruise set so I had to put my brakes on and slow down. 

The faster of the two truckers just got past the other semi but did not get back over into the slow lane for some reason. When he finally got back over I saw why he had been going so slow. There was a good ol' Ohio State Patrol car sitting in the median about 100 yards ahead. 

That nice trucker kept me from going over 65 miles per hour to save me from getting a pretty spendy ticket.

It was February 14 2012, chocolates and a balloon. I wasn't the most romantic person. Just following what I saw in the movies. And I was off to see my girl.

I was walking to the train station when from a distance, little girl standing  amongst the crowd of mindless, ignorant people. She was around 5 years old. There she stood, crying her eyes out. I couldn't see an adult with her. Obviously she was lost. Probably got separated from her parents when moving through the crowd. It was crowded at that time. What made it worst was people were just walking past her. Not even looking down on her. Like she was invisible. But if I could see get from a hundred metres away, why couldn't people inches away from her see her? This shows how horrible some people are. They wouldn't even attend to a lost little girl!

So I moved through the crowd. And eventually got to her. I kneeled down

He buys me a come along and leaves. The cops call the wrecker and it takes them a good hour to hour and a half to get the car out of the mud (its about 100 yards). We finish our work on the sign and it is dark. Just me and my buddy. We tried everything in the book to get my two wheel drive truck out of the mud, but nothing worked. I was so defeated. Tired and hungry and my truck said I had 2 miles of gas left. I didn't want to call a wrecker because for the last few months all of my bills have been piling up and I have been broke for quite a while. I was out of options, probably minutes away from calling the wrecker, even knowing it would drain my bank account. Then out of nowhere (almost literally since we were somewhat secluded) this truck pulls through the mud like its the road. A big jacked up 2002 GMC sierra with wide all terrain tires. I walk up to the truck and he gladly offers his assistance. I had a rope and a tow strap, and after evaluating the options, we tie together and he goes straight through the worst part of the mud with no problem and with pulling me! Ok it actually took 30 minutes because of some rope trouble and such, AND was able to find how to get to us was amazing to me by itself. But he got a little muddy

That's it. A text from my best friend. And I know for a fact she is 100% serious about it. It was so special for a number of reasons:

One is because I haven't seen her in a few years. She was in a two year program at college and then moved to the west coast. I am still on the east coast and just finished my 4 year degree. Besides the exchange of a few calls and texts

Another is because I know she works 70 hours a week and doesn't make much money at her job but she is following her dream. For her to be 100% serious about buying a plane ticket from the west coast to the east coast with her own money just goes to show her capacity to care for her friends.

I want to visit her. Hell

She is an amazing person who inspires me and that text alone couldn't express anymore how much she cares. It was the level of kindness expressed in that text that brightened my day. I showed my family and friends that text for the next few days and explained why she is my best friend. I am sharing here to hopefully inspire a random redditor who hasn't seen or heard from a good friend in awhile to just send them a simple message with good intentions.

I anticipated maybe 100 friends and family to ""participate"".  I am now at 1

**This is the event description**
This December 23rd marks the 20th year since we lost Marc Schluter to that tragic black ice accident. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think of my little brother. His looks and character live on in each of my children in his own special way. This Christmas will be another hard milestone for my family; it doesn't get any better you just get more used to the hole in your heart. In honor of Marc's memory

You didn't know him? That's alright, he won't mind.

I have a few suggestions:

1. Share a story about Marc on this event.

2. Share pictures of Marc on this event

3. Marc had a big heart and would have given you the shirt off his back if you asked him, tell the clerk that Marc Schluter picked up the coffee tab, sign the gift tag with Marc Schluter, make the donation in his name, tell your neighbor that Marc Schluter raked their yard. Let us know what you did if you want. 

4. Touch bases with my parents; no parent should have to buy their offspring. Just write, text, or stop in and say ""Hi, I'm thinking of you.""

5. If you have children

6. Think of him and smile because you knew him. Then pass that smile on to someone else and tell them it is from Marc.

7. Stop by while I brew my yearly Angel Over My Shoulder beer on December 23rd. I usually start late afternoon so that the first star of the night shines over my shoulder letting me know that my yearly brew buddy has arrived

8. Pass the challenge on to someone else

She has a little cousin who lives five minutes away. She is 10-years old I believe (somewhere around that). But before I tell you about her let me tell you about the major players in this girl's life.

**Her Dad-** The biggest piece of shit I've ever met. Former heroin addict. No job. Makes money by giving people criminally terrible tattoos. Drunk. Frequently shows up at little girl's school to pick her up drunk which the other kids tease her for. I heard a story that when his own mother was on her death bed dying of cancer a nurse caught him syphoning off her pain medicine for himself. Has Hepititis from the heroin. Oh and he beats her mom occasionally.

**Her Mom -** Ex heroin junkie. Doesn't work. Is on disability for various things related to a car accident. Really nice lady who constantly makes bad decisions. Will spend their entire month's food stamps in 2 weeks buying expensive food instead of spending it wisely. Also has Hepititis either from the heroin or one of her husband's shitty tattoos.

**Her Grandmother -** Smokes weed. Nice old woman. She is the breadwinner of the house. Seriously. She can barely walk and she is the only one in the house with a job. She works for a cleaning company. She walks all over town cleaning offices.

Okay so that's everyone. Here's what's going on with this little girl.

Basically with these two fuckups and the grandmother the little girl gets forgotten. She has been held back a year in school not because she's stupid or lazy. Her parents don't even put forward the effort to get her to school.

A couple months back on my birthday her father was arrested. He and his friends were stealing air conditioners from commercial businesses at night and selling them to scrap yards. With his record he will probably spend a lot of time in jail.

I rarely take joy in the misfortune of others but this was a rare exception. I genuinely feel like this dirtbag going away will help this entire family.

Unfortunately the wife doesn't feel this way. She thinks she lost a great man unjustly even though he has never done anything for his family but bring them misery. From what I've gathered she's started drinking more and bugs my fiance to take her to visit her husband a lot.

Anyway let me get back to the crux of the story.

Couple weeks ago my fiance went over to see her cousin the night before school started. Her mom was drunk out of her mind and told her

Unbelievable. The school isn't private but asks children to wear a white polo shirt and slacks. Her mom couldn't get her a $10 outfit so she could go to school (but can get drunk.)

So my fiance immediately drove to wal-mart and bought her school clothes. In fact she buys this girl stuff a lot. Sometimes she'll just swing by and take her out for an afternoon just to get her out of that house for awhile.

I feel bad because this girl doesn't even have a chance in the environment she's growing up in. I would ask you guys for something but I honestly don't know that would be.

So I guess. Advice? I'm getting to my breaking point. Do I go over and scream at her mother? Don't see how that would help.

If you guys have any ideas that require me to get more information I can.

**tl;dr** This girl's life just plain sucks.

Oh almost forgot. There was a creepy old man who lived down the street from her. He's in jail now. I'll leave it at that.",self,t5_2rl0v,1348491096.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofkindness/comments/10e1g5/i_dont_know_even_know_what_to_put_in_the_title/

**Supreme Overlord Colbert
---My name is Daniel and I was born and raised in Pennsylvania. Up until about two weeks ago, I put everything I could into my college experience. More often than not, that amounted to less studying and more socializing in my first few semesters at this fine institution. Of course, this resulted in some poor grades and some dropped classes. This summer, I finally decided what I wanted to do with my life. I realized just how much I enjoyed selling things to Americans, and how amazingly easy it turned out to be. After taking the previous semester off for being unable to motivate myself to do well, I chose to come back to school for a degree in Marketing/Business Administration. Since my previously declared major was Secondary Education with a focus in History

Over the summer, and I  was waiting to receive a refund check from the University after my government loans cleared. I was living in an apartment with two friends over the summer, and we continued that into the semester. 

With my previous semester being so awful, which I considered to be good news. I shouldn't have been so optimistic. When I returned to the admissions office, I was told to wait while they located my file, which they failed to produce. I was told to fill out the forms again, and to rewrite the appeal letter. Luckily, I had it saved to my google docs still, and was able to get it all turned in that day. I asked how long I should wait before checking in with them again. The wonderfully ignorant desk clerk told me it should take about two weeks to process the paperwork. I waited the two weeks and visited them again

I went back to my apartment and scheduled for classes. This happened to fall on the morning classes started. I finished my schedule at 8:30am, my financial aid situation was taken care of. That was a big mistake. I had completely forgotten to fill out the online request for government aid (FAFSA) and was informed immediately to do so. At this point, it would be late September. Using the internet browser ""Opera Next,"" on my home computer, I filled out the FAFSA in full. When I submitted my information, it hung on the loading screen and I thought that meant it was fine, or that my internet may have been lagging a bit. I went to the Financial Aid building the next day and let them know I filled it out and to await the results. I asked if there was anything else I needed to do, in early October

The money I had saved up was dwindling and I had begun to run out of food. I cannot stress to you how difficult it is to get out of bed in the morning when you are unsure as to where your next meal will be coming from. I am not without help, on numerous occasion, been gracious enough to provide me with a week's worth of groceries here and there. As I saw my bank account growing smaller, my apartment complex's landlord began demanding my money.

How it works here is, I had given them a check with every intent of having the money in my account the day the check was supposed to be cashed. When I found out that my aid was still not received by the school, I tried to reason with the secretaries and my landlord at the office. They told me that, with or without me having money, they still HAD to cash the check on the specified date. Upon doing so, they realized I couldn't pay when the check was returned to them as ""Insufficient Funds."" The office added on a ""Returned Check Fee"" to my bill, as well as the bank charging me for the same thing. Before this first bounced check

I immediately went to the Financial Aid office, none of my information was still saved, and it showed that nothing had been submitted. I asked my roommate and he told me I should try using Google Chrome, and that Opera Next isn't supported by a lot of interfaces on websites, primarily because it is still in a period of beta testing. I didn't think about that at all previously, but it made sense to me so I tried it. The FAFSA submitted properly on October 23. I was told by the Financial Aid office that it would take about two weeks to process and that there shouldn't be any more hiccups. I waited a week, after learning from my past experiences of listening to the office's advice

I couldn't fathom the idea that desk clerks, and she responded with ""Well, we're different departments completely. I have no idea what they do over there."" I was outraged. I took the paperwork necessary and completed it, knowing full-well that it was going to take at least another two weeks to get this figured out.

Throughout this time, but my case was an extreme and they just couldn't bring themselves to comprehend it. I understand their mentality. College kids try to get out of paying for things all the time. That's almost what college is about: learning how to live on as little as possible so that one day you can appreciate everything just a little bit more. The employees of the office were just doing their jobs, but I feel like they could have been a bit more lenient. In the time I was waiting for my financial aid, I wrote and asked them not to cash three different checks, which all bounced. 

A week ago today, all for essentially nothing. And that's my own fault. This semester I changed my ways. I was looking at the world in a completely different way. I finally figured out what I believe to be my purpose, and I was working towards that goal. After finding out my funding wouldn't be received, and that everything I had been working for this semester had been for naught, I went to discuss things with my landlord. I had been out for a couple days between these events, in which time the office had posted three letters stating to come talk to them or I would be evicted. When I got home, I marched over to face my inevitable fate. I knew I wouldn't be able to come up with a sum as large as $3200, in just one day. That's how he worded it. ""You have until tomorrow at noon to remove all of your belongings from the premises or the police will be notified to escort you out. It's just business.""

That all happened two days ago. I got out everything I owned and stored it at a friend's place, he also needed my information so he could document it in my case of check fraud. He asked where he'd be able to find me tomorrow so that he could arrest me if I didn't pay the amount in full by then.

I'm twenty years old. I live a decent life, even without cable. I would visit friends to use their internet to stream your show because I loved it that much. I still do. I was so enthused with the idea of the Colbert Nation that I designed my senior project around you. 

Now, and it's amazing."" Not because of raw talent, but because of hard work. It has been my dream to have this portrait featured on your show since I made it, and I just finally found myself in a situation where you could very well be my last hope.

My entire family is in debt. My friends' families are in debt. The ones with money refuse to help me. Whatever happened to people understanding that we all fall on rough times, besides possibly you, who could help me avoid a prison sentence for check fraud at age twenty. I didn't even know I was committing fraud! 

This is unbearable for me. I can't stand feeling helpless, I would do anything. In the age of technology, I know what that could entail. Hell, if you could find it in your heart and wallet to officially lend me the money, I'd still do anything and still would find a way to pay you back as soon as I possibly can get out of this mess.

My son asked for new reels for his 3D Viewfinder. While getting groceries at Fred Meyer, I started looking for runaways (that last toy that may have fallen behind the shelf). My success rate with this strategy is about 90% - I almost always find sold out items in the back or dropped below the shelf.

Lo and behold

""Oh no!"" I thought to myself. ""Some poor little kid left a Christmas card here!""

Reality sinks in. ""Wait

I open the letter and instantly know that it's a surprise

Then the letter strikes me - ""buy a gift for your child"" ... bingo! That's what I came here for - the gift is just enough to cover a few reels for my son!

As I walk to the checkout

""What if I slip one of these 5's in a stranger's cart?""

""That elderly customer could probably use this more than myself. I'm going to slyly drop a $5 bill in her cart as I walk by."" She walks between me and her cart. ""Nooo! I just wanted to anonymously help you!""

I keep thinking about how I can immediately pay this forward.

""I've got it! At the checkout

I check out. I give the cashier the envelope. She informs me that it is store policy to not do this and if I give it to her

I take my envelope back

""That's it! I'm going to pay this forward in the same way it was paid to me - I'll leave a few cash-filled anonymous letters in public places in 2013!""

As I said

Secret santa

**EDIT** ... I wanted to add something humorous. Just the day before I found this envelope, cheese, cat food, cat litter, and a loaf of bread. (while I didn't know this individual on a personal level, out paths had crossed once before when he was an employee and I was his customer at a large electronics store). I gave the cashier one of my gift cards and said ""Please anonymously apply this to the next customer's purchase."" I find it humorous that it took merely 24 hours for that $10 to find its way back to me :) A fine example of karma for those who believe in that!

Several more offered me help with programming, not judging me, offering me their assistance, really made my heart swell, and helped me realize that sometimes people really do just want to help, that they're not always wanting something in return, and that people are good and kind overall.

I can't wait until I am in a position to pay it forward.

My dad looks around in the back yard and I wrote it off as thunder . On our corner about 200 yards away is a liquor store. My dad looks over the fence and sees two people in a struggle and he hears a womans voice screaming at the top of her lungs (it was later found that the boom was her being thrown into those big metal electrical boxes). My dad throws on clothes as quickly as possible, When he doesn't he moves in closer. He tells him again and he still says no. My dad asks a third time and the continues and my dad gets him in a chokehold and squeezes. The lady who was being attacked ran the second my dad picked him up. The guy shoots his arms out and croaks ""Okay okay!"" When my dad started to apply more pressure. My dad sat him down and saw another guy running from the street.

My grandparents, the inside of their house is very wheelchair friendly. However, their backyard is a steep slope and obviously this is one renovation my grandpa won't be able to help with.

It is probably comical to watch me in the grocery store, and an older woman with arthritic knees who is mostly deaf is not in a great position to snag what few job openings there may be.

And then things got tough.  	
One of my daughters almost lost her life in childbirth.  Only a few months later, which is now refusing to heal.  Her husband fears that the company he works for may close.
Another daughter keeps getting recurring pneumonia and other respiratory problems as well as swelling of the lining surrounding the heart.  She was tested for everything under the sun
One grown son found out he has glaucoma.  Another might need his gall bladder removed.

Problem: Powers up but screen remains black (after LED flash). Likely a burnt out GPU

Some back-story: The same problem occurred approximately 1.5yrs ago. I sent it back to the manufacturer (iBuypower), they said it was now too old to be shipped to them (SC to CA) and refused to repair it. I took it to a local shop and they diagnosed it as a problem with some component of the motherboard. They had to ship it out of state for the repair because they didn't do that kind of work in their shop. Got it back (after like 2 months...) and it worked for a month, then BAM, same problem. Took it back to them, they then diagnosed the problem as the backlighting, they replaced that, got it back and it worked for ONE fucking day. By this time I had moved back to my parents (had just graduated) and after being basically passed off and ignored (by phone) I just said fuck it and decided to cut my losses -- because it was obvious they had taken advantage of my limited knowledge of laptop hardware and squeezed time and a few hundred dollars out of me.

Anyways, heh) based on the information/feedback I get from you guys.

I'm 33, and our kids spend a lot of their days in daycare.

I had plans. I've got a tidy little nest-egg ready to use as seed money in my own business venture - but I never have any time to actually advance my own goals. I've submitted all the paperwork to start my LLC

Since some time mid-childhood, I lost that job. I still don't know why, and the reasons they provided were contradictory.

They may have paid me a pittance, and my last two projects have since proved to be bestsellers for the company.

My business plan was to take my nest-egg, it did.

Now, driving to and from work, and sleep is spent on basic household chores and maintenance. I'm tired all the time. My job (IT-related - workflow varies) is the closest thing I get to a rest. I've had a total of four vacation days in the past year, and they were spent on things like medical appointments, packing, moving, and other chores - and yet

I'm rapidly coming to the conclusion that the only way I'll ever be able to chase my dream is to actively harm my family's financial security. I could quit my job and get things going, maybe two projects tops, but I would have to generate revenue pretty quickly in order to sustain my current financial situation. If it didn't, I'd be hunting for a job with a sparse and unimpressive resume, aiming for a pay rate which is, frankly, more than I could reasonably expect based on my skill set.

And I'm noticing that

And I'm realizing that, no one ever really expressed any enthusiasm for one of my designs past the original playtesting stage.

And I'm catching myself in the middle of thinking of some new game mechanic or concept for a game, stop that. What are you ever going to do with it?""

So now, surrounded by the detritus of more than 20 years of a hobby dedicated to studying, dissecting, and designing tabletop games - which, I'm starting to suspect, was an act of horribly misguided overconfidence. I'm miserable, and I can't even enjoy the hobby which used to provide some meager distraction from my job

I know I've got it ridiculously good. I have a job, childish dream?

Rationally, or literature. Now I can barely even enjoy *playing* games, one of my all-time favorite activities. I feel like I'm having an identity crisis.

I've just discovered this subreddit and I think it's great

I have dozens and dozens of CDs and books lying around that I'll more than likely never use again. So, or even **both!** In your comment, be sure to include your musical and literary tastes, so that I can send you something you'd hopefully enjoy. After you leave a comment, **send me a PM with your mailing address** and I'll send your envelope out.

Nothing will be in perfect shape, and a good bit of my music is found in the $1 section. Regardless, I hope you will enjoy it!

Do you think you guys could have a read through and see if you could help me?

Hi.
My name is Daniel I am 26 and I live in the UK. I am looking for a generous user that could potentially improve my quality of life.
3 Years ago just before my daughter was born I was taken ill while at work. It started out as a continuous headache that has never dissipated

I can't sleep unless I have some form of white noise playing from the radio due to the unrelenting buzzing noise in my head. I struggle to wash the dishes due to chronic back pain which induces pain attacks. Long exposure to bright light induces major pain and pain attacks which all together makes me severely depressed.
My thoughts are very dark and I have considered ending the pain before now

Over these 3 years I have taken several types of medication that I feel has ruined me over time. Topirimate, Citalopram, Nadalol, Valproic acid, Lansoprazole and Rizatriptan. I think thats them all... At some point my last doctor in a House esque move asked me to take all these at the same time.
I did this for a week and became very ill. Subsequently I do not see this doctor nor visit this hospital any more.
I live on the UK a very limited income as I don't fully qualify to be labeled as sick as I do not have a name for this problem. My new doctor who is a specialist in neurology has seen me recently and has ""invited"" me to come stay in the hospital for a few weeks and from what I gather I will be subject to a lot of tests.
He thinks I have something called Cushings or Cluster Headaches. He has advised me to get a grip of my life and create some kind of order.
I have had a sit down and a bit of a cry with my Girlfriend and my daughters and devised some form of super plan.

If I get a modern type phone that I can manage my appointments
Having a modern phone would help me sleep as I could use earphones for the white noise. I could use the calander without being on the pc. I could see photos of my family when I needed them
At this present time I don't have a mobile as I am pretty much housebound. The last phone I had was an iphone4 but I had to sell the thing to make rent.
I would like to thank you just for taking the time to read this and I must apologize that my English is not on track due to my illness. I am here to answer any questions you should need to ask.

Thank you!

Daniel.

------


I've never done this before

This tale may be a touch long

My dad broke his foot about ten years ago.  He has diabetes, ultimately turned gangrenous, the infection got into the bone, and after multiple surgeries and attempts to correct this, he ended up losing the leg.

This severely depressed him, had worn him down, and I think he basically just gave up.  About four years ago, maybe five, my mother left him.  She listed a lot of reasons (and I even sympathize with a few of them, my father is a lovely man, but he's not perfect), and we all know this, he would be dead in a handful of years

My dad was wheelchair bound by this time, especially considering how poorly my brother and sister treat him (god awful, and they're pigs to boot, they left rotting food just everywhere), so I stayed.  We couldn't afford a nurse or a helper, and SSI, while useful, yet couldn't afford food.

It was an awful stretch of years

The last year and a half, but about five months ago, matters game to a head, and I was forced to choose whether to stay and remain a doormat and the focus for abuse from both him and my brother (following in my 'lovely' mothers footsteps, abuse really does roll downhill), or go.

I made the hardest

That action was the straw that sent my entire family situation into a state of collapse.  Without my contribution to rent, kicking both habits rather successfully, has a job, and is pulling through school.  He's also supporting my sister at the moment (my mother tells him to let her live on the street).

My dad, has ended up in his darkest nightmare, and is currently stuck in an assisted living facility.


Now

Every spare bit of money he has is going towards paying back bills he had to let slide in the past (mostly medical stuff), and it is breaking my heart to watch.

Worst of all, and I'm trying to let go of some of the fear and learn to live a bit of the life I put on hold so many years ago, so I'm moving in with my previously long distance boyfriend.

Good idea, I won't be in the area to keep him company, to talk to him, to offer a friendly face as the only family member he has left who isn't intent on manipulating him, or holds an excessive amount of hatred towards him.

In short, articulate, lively man a way to live outside the narrow, dirty room he is currently stuck in, as well as allowing me to keep in contact with him long distance.

The facility he is in does have wireless, but honestly, I'm sure we could find out a way to set up anything anyone felt fit to provide.

He does not need a high powered machine.  He mostly does YouTube


If anyone can help me, I could make use of), I would deeply appreciate the help and/or the information.

We live in LA, broken any of the rules of the forum, or if this would fit better in another place, again, please let me know.  I have no intention of offending, considering I am going out on a limb to seek help here.

With a useless degree, namely some asain cafe.  To be honest, Iâm not that bad of a person and I have done good deeds.  I was part of a sustainability club.  I help raise money and thought up a way to promote students to use bicycles and reuse water bottles.  For the bicycles, the idea was to have a self repair ramp on campus, where people can bring their bicycles and use the leasy accessible tools to repair bikes.  It was a nifty thing and it worked!  It kept students from using fueled cars and save money.  The water refill station was an awesome thing.  Very stylish and high tech.  It looks like a mini version of the gallon refills in front of the supermarkets like Food 4 Less.  This keeps students from ever  throwing away any more plastic bottles.  Iâve also joined a club thatâs against cancer.  Iâve raised funds through setting up event.  The money goes towards cancer research which I still believe today its highly needed.  And of course, I couldnât forget that namely Riverside has the most homeless and shadey people in the area.  But nonetheless I treat them as human beings, I greet them and do give spare change if I do have some

But what depresses me today is that I had finally had the guts to tell my girlfriend about my grades and my current state of my own future.  And she wasnât happy,  but who knows Iâm trying my best to cope with the situation at hand.  So now Iâm just depressed about myself, I donât work as of now and am a poor college student.  Iâve already invested my lunch money on my girlfriend so I hope she will calm and sympathize with me tomorrow.  So Iâm just hopeing somebody could gift me settlers 7 so it could get my mind off things and make me a bit happier.  I appreciate that.

**Update**: I take the detail back about having a girlfriend.  I no longer have a girlfriend.  She dumped me because she wanted to ""establish her life with someone who can make money"".  It doesn't really helped that during the course of finals preparation,False,self,t5_2rl0v,True,,,t3_quwuj

Leslie's list of medical diagnosis started with immune deficiency and autoimmune phenomena; she does not make her own antibodies. Today her list of medical diagnosis is thirteen long, and more complicated health issues like low adrenal function or glutathione peroxidase deficiency because they are a part of her life. Since she was two years old she has had to make frequent trips to the nearest medical facility for [IVIG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IVIG) infusions. She also has numerous other health issues, with the most recent addition being Type 1 Diabetes, which in itself has set off her seizure disorder. This particular condition has negatively impacted her life; she has serious memory issues and uncontrolled temporal lobe seizures. So far, Leslie has had 50 surgeries due to varying complications from her health disorders. This upcoming trip is primarily due to her seizure disorder - her neurologist here in Alaska referred her to Mayo Clinic for an evaluation for brain surgery.

Leslie is an individual who is determined to persevere and overcome

A year ago I started on my lifelong goal of becoming a Midwife. I've served over 30 families in the last year

I rely on my car for the entirety of my business and to function in daily life. Prenatal and Postpartum visits, even when it's like tundra outside). 

After borrowing a family member's vehicle and being told cash monthly payments were about to be arranged for it's purchase

This was sudden and unexpected for us and definitely not something we were prepared for financially. 

We are unable to afford financing through major dealerships and don't need anything brand new. Just safe and reliable so that I can focus on birthing and caring for my baby over the next year as well as caring for the dozens of women I serve annually. 

We are hoping someone has a car they've been holding onto for someone special. Maybe a parent or grandparent that is no longer driving has something sitting in the garage. Maybe someone is moving suddenly and wants to spread some good karma before they leave. Maybe the person that just won that 590 million dollar lotto decides to read this and help. Maybe you just want to send cash. Maybe you want to send us good vibes. Whatever it is you believe

I just don't want to be on the side of the road with a newborn on the way to another birth with a broken down car.

1362202408.0,19id7o,Gary: A Case for Humanity,cloutissimo,1,1,0,"Dear fellow Redditors
 
I hope you take the time to read this story and what's more I hope you can take something from it.  You see every now and then something can happen to you that will really put just where you are in life into mind altering perspective.  For me that event happened today.
 
I got into the car business for one reason and one reason only: money.  I had a girlfriend with whom I wanted to raise a family and needed to make more money.  I had bills and student loans which I needed to be able to pay more securely.  I had physical wants that I was tired of denying myself.  And so I became a car salesman and my financial status quickly grew.  I am now happily engaged to that wonderful girl.  My bills are right on track.  I drive a luxury sport sedan and so on and so forth.  But today all of that truly got wiped from my vision when I stumbled upon Gary.
 
Gary is an old man.  That's the best way I know how to describe him.  I first spotted him on my showroom floor yesterday, old man,"" as I continued walking and didn't think much of it.  After all I have other things I need to do so why give it a second thought?
 
This morning at 8:29 Gary was back on the showroom floor.  The salesman he had dealt with the previous day was not going to be in the office today and so one of our other sales people tended to Gary in his stead.  I kept walking to stock in my trades from the previous evening and by the time I got back Gary had left again.  I went about my day without thinking of it again.
 
The afternoon rolled around
 
""Sir
 
""I need the number for an All-State agent
 
A simple enough request
 
As it turned out I only had the card of a Farmers' agent and I informed Gary as such.
 
""Do they have the safe driver discount?""  he wondered aloud.
 
""Well, they just call each program something different.""  An honest answer.
 
""Well now what should I do?""  He asked directed at me.
 
I told him I would look up the local agents' numbers for all four major carriers and he could shop their rates and pick what fit his needs the best.  I looked them all up in my smart phone
 
""Well
 
""OK
 
""Let me just go to my car and see if I have it.""  
 
I waited for what I thought to be the most obvious conclusion, ""Sir, I cannot possibly accept any money from you!""
 
""Why not?""  He seemed puzzled
 
""Because all I did was give you four phone numbers
 
""I'm not paying you for the numbers.  I'm paying for your courtesy....isn't...isn't that what God wants?!""
 
I didn't know how to respond.  The question broke my heart.  
 
Finally after a moment that seemed an eternity I said
 
I still don't think he understood why I didn't accept his money.
 
This whole scenario though truly shook me up.  I was very upset and had to take several moments to compose myself and try to make sense of how awful I felt for Gary.  To me there were basically two options.  Either Gary is an eccentric billionaire who just gives away money for good deeds or, chat, and help them is worth a very considerable portion of the money they have.
 
I don't think I'll ever see Gary again, like I did in the first stages of meeting Gary, you will step up and be that person.
 
Maybe it's a family with a hood popped and open in the grocery store parking lot
 
I guess what I learned today is that sometimes
 
Thanks for listening.
