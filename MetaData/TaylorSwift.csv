But I want to know how many of you are open about being a Swifite

---

Indicate your choice from the following options

1. I make a big deal about being a Swftie
- I mention it if it comes up in conversation
- I'll let a select few people know
- I try to keep it to myself
- It's my little secret

- *Alternatively: I don't consider myself a Swiftie*

I normally shy away from focussing on these

- Age 
- Gender *^(Edit: The number of people feeling the need to assert their sexuality is Too Damn High)*

I'll follow up with the results

*Feel free to share your stories of sharing

*okay so i just found out something about Taylor that makes her an amazing human being (even though we already know that).*

*I was driving through my neighborhood here in KC and there were blue ribbons tied around all the trunks of the trees. I had no idea what it meant

*Apparently the little girl who lives next door to me had been diagnosed at the beginning of the year that she had a rare form of cancer

*This little girl absolutely loved Taylor Swift

*Then about a week ago, so her parents had to hold the phone to her ear and do the speaking for her. Apparently her and Tay talked for around an hour, and at the end of the convo, Taylor told Bree that she would send her something special in the mail and to look for it in the new few days.*

*Well 3 days later a packed arrived for Bree, basically everything a Taylor fan would ever want. Taylor had also included a pair of tickets for Bree and her mom to see her when she comes to KC in August.*

*2 days after that package arrived

*It was her dying wish. And Taylor helped her get it.*

*I talked to Bree’s mom yesterday and they are going to put all the merch that Taylor sent her and the note from Taylor that was in the box

*So if you still think Taylor Swift is a horrible person

There's this one guy on twitter (@MikeDanger989 I believe), and tons of people started getting in on the conversation and asking him questions and what not. He replied to many fans, with very informative answers. Sadly, this morning he deleted all of said tweets. Luckily, I was able to scribble down some information he 'leaked' out. Here goes:

* The song is about a breakup
* To describe the song: upbeat, clever, sassy, angry.
* Very pop-like song
* Taylor **will** perform the single on her webcast this Monday.
* Radio stations will be allowed to play the single on Tuesday.
* Very personal song
* The word 'never' is used a lot in the song.
* Opposite of Eyes Open
* Main instrument is guitar.
* Roughly 3 minutes in length. 
* About an on/off relationship.

He/she also does this for various other subreddits

Now, combined with her recent album that is far more mature that her first 3, we could actually have some quality discussions - at least discussions that warrant more than 0 or 1 comments. Off the top of my head:

* Has the general public's image of Taylor changed since Red came out? Is she seen more than just the innocent girl singing about boys?

* Did Kanye's interruption at the VMAs propel Taylor into stardom?

* Is ""22"" about the carefree single life

* What will her next album be like? Is she going to be going further down the electronic road like ""I Knew You Were Trouble"" or will she go back to country like her self-titled album?

* What will Taylor be like in 20 years? Washed out, or an influential country (or pop) star?

* What is it like going to her concerts? Is it worth going if you are in the nosebleeds? Is it all 13 year old girls or are there college guys too?

I think/hope you get my point. In general, and engaging subreddits have one of two formulae: original content images or judgement free discussion. Because most/all of us don't hang out with Taylor, OC pictures might be a bit tough. But if we can start and facilitiate quality conversations with different opinions and a lack of dissent (downvoting), this could be a really cool, engaging subreddit.

I would propose that we strive for posts to be limited to:

* Self-posts

* New music videos

* New interviews

* News


And *maybe*:

* Good covers of Taylor's songs

* Good mash-ups with Taylor's songs

* MAYBE picture updates of Taylor at awards ceremonies/new haircut

Basically

I think I am done with my rant/proposal. I really like Taylor Swift's music, this could be a really fun place.

TL;DR: Current state of subreddit is boring and doesn't fuel discussion. Let's change that. ",self,t5_2rlwe,1364006881.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/1as2oj/forgive_my_rant_but_i_feel_like_this_subreddit/

**LOCATION**

**The location I've established would be the best for everyone is Rugby**

* **It's central** which means the easiest
* **It has a fairly major railway station** with good connections to most UK locations
* **It's on two major motorways** - the M1 and M6
* **The River Swift is there** - needs no explanation

I was considering different options, to everyone. I had considered London and Manchester, but neither of these are central or easy/cheap to reach.

**DATES**

I'm fairly open to dates

For simplicity I'll suggest we go for **Saturday 2nd March**. I'm not intending to dictate a date

Failing the 2nd March

**ITINERARY**

* Meet up between 11:00 and 12:00 at [The Station Bar](https://plus.google.com/115721503128640684342/about?gl=uk&amp;hl=en) ([Directions](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?saddr=Railway+Terrace&amp;daddr=The+Station+Bar,+Rugby&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=52.377132,-1.252763&amp;spn=0.009313,0.01929&amp;sll=52.377361,-1.25301&amp;sspn=0.004657,0.009645&amp;geocode=FaA8HwMdDuns_w%3BFWEwHwMdqtXs_yn55YqruEB3SDFlHdUxn2WOdQ&amp;oq=The+Station&amp;t=m&amp;dirflg=w&amp;mra=ls&amp;z=16))and wait for everyone to arrive. Bring along any Reddit and/or Taylor merchandise you might have so everyone knows how to find us.

* Once everyone has arrived

* I'd like us to spend some time presenting (nothing too formal) our respective favourite Taylor song. Come prepared with a few points of what you like about the song and anything you think might be insightful. We can follow this with some down time just generally socialising with a selection of Taylor's songs playing.

* It'd be nice to get a group photo at a sign with the Park's name for posterity

* Once the evening sets in we can have dinner at the nearby Pizza Hut which should cater to most tastes


**TRAVEL**

One of the factors for choosing Rugby is that it's much cheaper to travel to than London or Manchester. I've established the prices for trains below, on the 23rd February.

[Prices for travel to Rubgy](http://i.imgur.com/keYN19J.png)

It might be worth considering a Young Person's Railcard if you're 25 or under. It's £28 for a year's validity

In need of particular attention are those of you in South Wales and South Scotland

**PLEASE REPLY TO THIS THREAD**

Please comment in this thread, failing that then the county).

**Let us know how you intend to travel

Based on this we can hopefully establish whether any of us can end up travelling together - whether by car or train.

Please also post your preferred dates from the list above and we can reach a concensus on when to arrange it for.

So, the next song that logically follows is ""Sparks Fly"". Now, the next participant finds a part of lyrics that appears both in ""Sparks Fly"" and another one of her songs, and names the song for the next guesser. I just thought it would incredibly awesome if we could make a chain for *all* of her songs without breaking it!

Some more rules:

1)The one who has found the reference in another song needs to point out the *exact lyrics*

2)If it can be avoided

3)If you are completely sure the chain has ended
