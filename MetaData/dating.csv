1368718565.0,1egexp,Why courage is better than confidence...,authenticman,46,5,18,"Confidence is universally recognised as one of the most attractive traits a man can possess. You’ll be very hard pressed to find any dating adverts by women looking for men lacking confidence. However

That quality is COURAGE.

Confidence can be defined as “A feeling of assurance, “The state or quality of being certain.”

Meanwhile, frightening, or very difficult.”

So

Why then

Because courage represents the willingness to take a risk whilst confidence does not. Confidence, but it is also its limitation because it cannot operate outside the realm of the known. In order to step into the unknown it takes courage!

A man who operates only in the realms of safety and the known doesn’t have the willingness to take a risk. He only takes the calculated risks that he knows will succeed, are no risks at all.

A man who is prepared to step beyond the realms of the known for what he believes to be right and good will take any risk

A courageous man has the capability to approach any woman

A courageous man has the willingness to express exactly how he feels without any veil of insincerity. He knows not what the result will be.

A courageous man has the openness to be fragile or vulnerable or weak

Courage opens up the doors to infinitely more possibility than confidence. And ultimately

Don’t believe me?!?

Go out and ask some female friends if they’d aspire to be with a man who is afraid to express his emotions

Women are dying to meet real men. Men who are willing to step into the unknown. Men of COURAGE!

What does this mean practically?

It means don’t be afraid to express yourself if it feels right.

It means don’t be afraid to be in touch with your emotions if it feels good.

It means don’t be afraid to reveal your vulnerability in order to protect your ego.

Ultimately, whether or not you are afraid, take the actions that feel right and good in abandonment of protecting your ego.

Don’t expect that you have to be confident at all times. When confidence is absent courageousness takes over. Be courageous!",,t5_2qhb1,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1egexp/why_courage_is_better_than_confidence/

Umair Haque is London-based consultant



Gathered from his twitter page:

1. If you like someone

2. If you ""like"" people purely because of their looks


3. If you're not being yourself on dates


4. ""Rejection"" is a dumb word for a dumb idea. Don't take it personally when you don't click with someone.


5. Don't idealize people. We all have crushes


6. If you can't seem to meet people, shows. Be interesting.


7. If someone doesn't like you back, and people are many.

8. Don't ever (ever) try to convince someone that doesn't like you ""why"" they should. You'll feel worse. Find someone who does.


9. ""Attractiveness"" is a stupid myth. People are drawn to people who bring out the best in them. So be one.


10. You're going to get your heart broken. If you're lucky. So stop protecting

11. Finally, unhappy, break up immediately.



Some other side tweets written by him:

* There's a difference between how a person makes you feel

* Go to the gym. Get a sense of style. Not because society expects it

* Don't ever compare yourself to generic ideals of ""attractiveness"". We are all hot when we have the confidence to see ourselves as so.


* So you have to open yourself to the surprising possibility of people--not just what you ""want"" from them--if you're after love.


* So just find people you really think are cool and interesting and let them know. The more you idealize people

Naturally, Civil Rights Act, single-payer insurance kind of change, and it can only be done if we have both houses and the White House.

Some random thoughts:  I'm humanist/atheist (Buddha/Jesus were probably cool historical figures.  Probably not supernatural beings.).  Fast becoming a Joss Whedon acolyte (currently working through Buffy S6/Angel S3).  Pugs are the best breed.

And she is the only one who actually came up to visit me. She spent hundreds of dollars and flew over 500 miles to spend two weeks with me.

So why exactly would I not be with her? All in good time

Online dating just isn't for me.  I've ran into a lot of crazies on there and I don't think I belong on the sites.  My previous girlfriends came from people I knew or I knew the girl from school or work.  The work thing can be iffy because it can create awkward moments


Any ideas on how I can get out of this funk?  I feel like I'm stuck for some reason.  I'd be happy to share stories from my online dates (a lot of crazy ones


TL;DR: I've been on dozens of online dates that didn't work and I'm looking for tips on meeting women that are not from a website.

So, I just ignore them or say sorry I'm not interested. I've actually been thanked by girls for being so considerate. I tried the whole seeing if she'll ""grow on me"" bit, but I felt like it's just torturing myself. My friends say I need to just ""game"" the girls and sleep with them and stop thinking so much.

 She has made some mistakes in life but I have seen her make an effort to turn her life around. She is now a month pregnant and is trying her best to get ready for this coming child. The father of the child is a coward and completely out of the picture. Her mother kicked her out of her house for her efforts in meeting her father for the first time in 12 years. 


 She has confessed to me that she wishes she had never made some of the decisions she has made. She also confessed her interest in me. I was only able to tell her that I was not ready for a relationship or to be a father


  I havent stopped talking to her since and iv'e found myself really getting into this girl. I feel her winning my heart. She really is a good girl. I just refuse to believe that I'm falling in love with a pregnant girl. Iv'e struggled through the years growing up not only saving myself for marriage
Yesterday I had to remind her that we could only be friends. It hurt me so bad

 Am I just infatuated by her? Am I in love? Do I forget about my plans and take this child as my own and fight to make a family with this girl? Do I continue to push her away? 
I haven't know her for long but I feel like I do. What do I do? Am I being stupid for even considering raising this child as mine? Am I being stupid for allowing the child to be a factor?

Confidence... If you ask any girl what shes looking for when a guy asks her out, your implying that she probably wouldn't want to go with you and your also giving her an easy out by assuming shes busy. This does not portray any confidence what so ever. In fact its like the anti-confidence way of asking out a chick. If shes really really into you and you have been missing every sign then ya she will probably say yes anyway but thats usually not the case. So what would be a way to ask a girl out with confidence? Simple, know what exactly you want to do and assume her answer will be yes. For example: 


You: ""So Jenny did you see the trailer for that movie 30 Minutes or less?""


Jenny: ""Ya that looked like it was pretty funny!""


You: "" Ya it did


Or you can just one line it like: "" So Jenny I really want to go see 30 Minutes or Less this weekend and I would love for you to come with me."" 


In both those situations you just made a definitive decision of what you want to do and implied that you know she would go with you. Girls hate when guys are indecisive. The worst thing you can do is pass a choice back onto a girl if she asks you like "" So where do you want to go after the movie?"" and you say ""I dont care its up to you"". Always make the decision

To get to the point, hazel eyes, but I don't really look black or white. Most people upon meeting me assume I have some sort of Hispanic background, or it becomes a game for them to guess where I'm from. I've gotten Egyptian, Moroccan, Brazilian, Persian, Greek, and a host of others.

Once people find out I'm part African American, they suddenly back off. I've gotten this from white, Asian, Indian, and Hispanic guys (I don't live in an area with many black people, so I don't think I've ever been approached by a black guy). I've never sealed the deal after I've been 'outed' and so it makes me reluctant to ever divulge my background.

I don't think people are consciously thinking 'that girl is not my race, no one sees me an potential partner. It's ridiculously frustrating and I'm at the end of my rope.

Online dating is even worse. Along with all the rude messages twenty-something girls normally receive, ""Why the long face?"" Horse replies ""My wife is fucking a black man."") I wasn't offended, but eventually he says something to the effect of 'How would your father feel if you were dating a black guy?' I responded that since my mother is black, I doubt he would care.

I should probably explain that I was just recently diagnosed with Asperger's and that that is probably the root cause. I guess a lot of aspies are hypersensitive to touch, studying body language and conversation, and I tried to sort of re-wire my brain on all kinds of stuff. And I succeeded! I am really social now. I learned how to do small talk, I can look people in the eye, I can crack jokes, I am GREAT at making friends now, I can hang out (the ""How to Hang Out"" puzzle took me probably 3 years nonstop study to crack. I was super proud of that one). None of my friends know I am an aspie and they'd be shocked if I told them. But the one thing I have not been able to solve is flirting/dating and especially the kissing. I can get through the 1st and 2nd dates using the stuff I learned about how to make friends. But shifting gears from developing-a-friendship to developing-a-romantic-relationship is utterly beyond me. I cannot read flirting cues and most of all this kissing thing is turning out to be my Achilles heel. I cannot figure it out.


I KNOW it's possible for me to learn social stuff like this from scratch if I can just get some guidelines to sort of map my way through it and learn how to think about it. So I have two questions: 


**(1) WHY DO YOU LIKE KISSING?** What about it is appealing? Why is not just icky/suffocating/wet?  

**(2) How do you actually do it?** How EXACTLY does the first kiss get started, when do you stop, how do you break it off, and then, on subsequent dates how often/when is the kissing? Do you just kiss constantly all the time once you've got started, or when you greet or before sex or what exactly????

How about for example saying:

Or whatever, just do it! Not only here but also in real life!!

Talk to the girl, get to know yourself first and that way you will know what you really want.

If you want someone pretty, maybe your clothes, do the things that you expect your future S.O. to have or do.

I falsely thought that if I could get things stable and everything together I would be able to find someone worth being around.

All the women around my age seem to have been married before and now have kids that are almost teenagers. Their all so bitter towards men and it seems like they only reason they would consider me is so they can have some man's voice yell at their kids while I pay for everything.

I've only been in two serious relationships, but is also known to listen to peoples problems no matter how inane they may seem.  I'll be the guy that when a female friend feels like shit, they talk to me.  A couple of times, I've convinced myself ""Hey, maybe this could happen between me and her"", only to be told ""We are just friends.""  Because of these failures I've had, I hold back on acting up on my feelings or what my friends sometimes believe to be missed opportunities.

So, like my friends believe, or that I have no chance.

Here goes.  There is this girl I've known for a couple of years now.  By known, and the other way around.  However, it wasn't until recently that we actually started talking to each other outside of just when we meet through our mutual friend.  However, these aren't that common.  Once, she went to my apartment, just to hang, and we ended up going out to eat, but then a lot of times

One of the things she talks to me about with frequency is how lately she feels like being in a relationship.  She says how she has never been in one, right?  Well... she then starts talking to me about some of the guys she is currently attracted to...  See, from here on out, I start to feel like she isn't interested in me at all.  My train of thought is ""Why would a girl talk to a guy she is interested in about another guy?""  Which to me sounds like a pretty convincing argument.  

Anyways, when I talk to her through online chat, she barely ever answers.  Sounds stupid, but hey, I'm fragile.  But then, when she came to visit my area, though a couple of way closer friends live nearby, and were viable options, the more I like her

And yes

Problem is apart from the 9+ year relationship I have very limited experience, much less dating or bedding. I'm not even sure if what I describe above is at all socially acceptable.

Before my long relationship I would look for girls that I fell somehow magically in love with. Now, and that also makes it hard for me to choose who to approach. Is it OK and acceptable to approach someone you could very well have sex with or go on a date with, but don't feel much towards? Is this completely out of bounds for friends? For strangers? If you want casual sex, do you fake feelings until it's over and then part - or do you straight up say all you want to do is press her up against the wall and slip a finger down her crotch?

Stacy was a very cute girl and I really liked her.
We talked a lot, touching me, asking for hugs when I had to leave, and liking my facebook pictures.
So after a while I finally asked her to go for a drink sometime.
I was so nervous
What was planned as a 30 minute drink became 3 hours of non-stop talking and laughing on both sides. We had a great time, and she gave compliments back.
In fact, no jokes that didn't land- and was high fiving myself by the time we left. 

So we biked back together, and asked her if she'd like to be my girlfriend. I basically was 99% sure she'd say yes.

But she just said: 'I'm sorry

I've never had a proper method to pick up girls, I knew that there were things that made my chances of getting a girl better. I tried to change that, I tried to learn, I made some changes in my persona (small ones, really) and thought about it now and then.

A few months ago I had drunken sex with a girl I met randomly. She is nice and I've been kind of dating her since, I think I can pick up hotter girls.

I asked a different one on a date the other day, and then cancelled, I learnt then not to startle them, there must be a proper way of doing these things.

I had a good night yesterday, and obviously I'm not going to back off, I want her to be mine.

So, and I think I got the complete plan. I humbly ask the community of lover masters of reddit to review this long writing, and give me their view on it. I'll use it to get a proper date with this lady, I'm going to know what am I doing this time.

The text is too long to fit as a single submission

**Stages**

There are six stages in your relationship with a girl:

1. Contact: You notice the girl
2. Entrance: You start talking with the girl
3. Familiarity: You two get to be comfortable with each other with people around
4. Dating: You two get to be comfortable alone
5. Intimacy: You two have had sex once or more
6. Stable: You are in a monogamous relationship

It doesn't matter which stage do you want to arrive with the girl in question

* Change scenario
* Meet the intimacy level
* Use an appropiate span of time

The girl needs to feel that you two have moved to a higher stage, and sets you to pursue the objectives to reach the next stage. The difficulty of each of this stages peaks between Familiarity and Date, and once you reach Intimacy the girl normally will lead the way, blame the genes, but your part of the game is until you have sex, then it is her game to get a stable relationship. That's why my writing only talks about getting laid, I like stable relationships more than one night stands

[Please find the story on the replies below]

You went through the first 5 stages with Elisa, also coming back in the afternoon), Familiarity (drinks with the workmates), Dating (sculptor's party, and then balkan's party, and then dinner date), and Intimacy (you have to play football

**Timelines**

There is a maximum and a minimum for the time you can spend in each stage

* Contact: 0 to 60 seconds (maybe less)
* Entrance: 1 to 10 minutes
* Familiarity: 10 minutes to 3 hours
* Dating: one evening to several days

If you don't spend enough time

* In Contact there is no minimum time, this is good for making mates too. It's very nice to be friends with the random people you meet during the day).
* In Entrance you look desperate if you ask her to come along before at least having a laugh with her
* Familiarity, that is what has happened before.
* In Dating, and that takes time or it looks forced.
* Finally, so here you need to have a little of patience, keep and escalate the physical contact, and get her involved by changing scenario.

If you spend too much time

* In Contact you start looking like a creep
* In Entrance you will run out of chat lines and jokes
* In Familiarity
* In Dating, so she marginally wants to pass to the next stage. You are showing what you would be as a stable partner at this stage. Still, there is no reason to risk it now that you have spent so much time.

The second point regarding timelines are the game breaks. Every time that you lose contact with the girl for the day, when you left the sculptor's party and she kissed your cheek you had already physical contact, but she won't hold your hand in the next party for a while, so you will have to redo part of the job. After the balkan party you have a proper date, but although the phase is called Dating, actual dates happen from the middle of it, the first middle is spent securing the stage change from Familiarity

**Scenarios**

You will notice that to change stage you have changed scenario, sometimes he calls you to take a girl with him, sometimes you do it, you both have agreed to accept the other along, even going a little bit out of your own way if that is necessary. You have a couple of friends with this kind of relationship, which help every one. The Dating stage is all about having possible scenarios to take the girl to, like parties, fun places (bowling! bingo with the old ladies! irish pub with folk music

There is not much to it, and it is a powerful tool.

**Objectives**

It's handy to have the objectives that separate stages quite clear

1. Contact: Talk with the girl.
2. Entrance: Make her laugh. Agree a common ground where you can have time with other people around.
3. Familiarity: Again
4. Dating: You need to make her want to be alone with you from the start

Everyone is aware about the objectives of dating

**Tools**

There are plenty of tools for each stage, and getting to PUA forums, but never take it too seriously, it needs to be fun.
Have a set of greetings to start conversations, think of questions to get more information on the girl, learn some dancing, whiten your teeth, get a man haircut, learn how to dress, learn about perfume, make friends that know where the good parties are, have movies at your flat

**Outro**

If you have read all this, there are a lot of normal, intelligent people here. I've made a new account to mark the change of personality I just had.

I'm still young so I understand there's no rush and everything and also due to my age I'm limited in age brackets. Women generally want to date older guys and I don't really want to date someone who has just turned 18 so my bracket is basically 19-20.

Despite this I'd like to believe I'm an attractive (I'll post pics if needed), tall (6ft) guy who has passionate hobbies ( I'm a black belt in karate, I play the guitar and do gardening). I don't live with my parents: I have my own place (which isn't run-down or anything it's nice and by a river). I pay my bills and I like to follow politics.

Maybe I'm sounding arrogant but isn't that all the cliché qualities women want out of guys?

I've never been able to date a single woman though. All I want is someone who is in decent shape (they don't have to be a marathon runner I'm happy with love handles or stick thin) and being able to talk to me about interesting topics rather than celebrity gossip. I'm not a ""boob  guy"" or an ""ass man""

Now

Negatives? Well , I don't mean to it's just the way I write and talk (as you can tell by this post).

**1)** ""Games"".  From my perspective, and if there's not a good match up between the two of us, that's the end of it.  If there *is* a good match-up, then I continue the dating process until there's either some unresolvable difference or I end up married.  (Not looking for an eventual marriage?  That's absolutely fine and normal, but let me know fairly soon, because you aren't my type then.  No need to waste each other's time by withholding important information like that.)

But I'm learning this isn't the way many people think about the dating process.  Instead, go on a date -- or there isn't, in which case, both parties need to let the other know there is no chance and move on.  It's emotionally draining to fritter about wondering what the other person is thinking, and I don't like ""drama/emotion"" anyway (as long as there's starving children in the world, I have no time for ""dramatic"" dates).  Just be straightforward and say what you're thinking.  If we could all read each other's minds, I imagine relationships would form much quicker and last much longer.

*1a)* As a little aside to this point, I could see how, but a lot of time there's no physical change.

**2)** Friend/date separation.  Peoples' complaints about the friendzone have long confused me.  My parents have been happily married forever and get along better than any other couple I know.  They both say they are each other's best friend (i.e. you marry your best friend).  So I don't understand this strange division nowadays between someone you'd date and someone you'd just be friends with.  For the latter, why on earth would you date someone and not be close friends with them?  It's absolutely puzzling to me.

**3)** The sex obsession.  Alright, intelligence, and even physical beauty than anything sexual.  Yet it seems as though nowadays relationships (society as a whole?) are built entirely around this concept.  Is my brain really so much different than the norm with regard to this?

When I was put in my class

She's in my circle of friends (clique) and there are 4 guys and 2 girls in this group. We have gone out as friends more than once and I have talked to her a couple of times. Seems like I can really talk to her when its only the 2 of us. However I do notice that with other people around us ( excluding the clique) she doesn't really talk to me. She talks to some other guys sometimes in a situation where there are many people.

So I am confused. Is she interested such that she is shy and does not talk to me when there are others around. Or she just doesn't talk to me then. I'm unclear. The other guys that she talk to (outside clique) aren't any better than me.

In one of our convos we talked about photography. So I asked her if she would like to go out with me and some of my friends for a photography outing. However she said it would be weird cause she would only know me. So I suggested that I ask one of my other friends to bring a girl along. She however still wasn't sure.

I'm 18 year's old

So when I started Uni I met this girl, pluss a bit drunk while writing).

Anyway me and 'Bob' get on well straight away as the whole misunderstanding about knowing her twin at college kind of breaks the ice. Through the first couple of weeks at Uni Bob and her friend start coming over our flat all the time and this becomes our little group. We started to all sit in my room as I have the best entertainment stuff (xbox, etc.) and me and Bob would often sit on bed. She started to put her legs over mine (like lying down sort of thing) and I would rest my hand on her leg. In the fourth-ish week we're in this position and by this time we've started touching each other allot. 

I take all the touching as a signal as I have no experience so I lean over and kiss her on the cheek to show that I like her. She didn't really react at all just kept staring at the telly so I said ""was that wrong for me to do that"" and she calmly said ""No, she said something like ""nah it was fine, just go with the flow. A kiss isn't going to mess anything up"". So a little while after that we were all at her flat and me and her were sat next to each other on her bed. 
We had gotten very close (sitting close to each other) and were holding hands and stuff, she had her hands all over me. 
The night after we were all out again at a bar for pool-night, were you drunk or something?"" and she laughed (nervously) and said she was I said ah ok (I probably looked visibly upset). I said ""Do you remember US?"" and she asked again ""Us?"" and I said ""well yeah, we were like kissing and stuff on your bed"" she said ""no sorry"" and I again probably looked very upset. She said ""I think we just need to give it more time, we've only known each other a few weeks"". I said yeah I understand. Anyway, fast-forward a couple of weeks and me and her on her bed again, I was going off the advice of a friend who advised me that I would get 'friendzoned if I didn't show her I had some balls"". So that night I had my hand on her inner thigh and then I kissed her, she looked at me and I said ""Sorry is it still too soon"". She said something like either ""I don't know what we're doing"" or ""I don't know, we keep kissing for like an hour and I try to make a bit more of a move because of what my friend said, I said ""Is that too far"" and she said ""I'm just thinking about the time"" It was 1am and we both had lectures at 9am. So I went home

Anyway the next night we were both home for the weekend

I took this really hard and off another friends advice didn't text anything back apart from ""I need to be alone for a bit"". And she said ""Oh why?"", I just think we're best off being friends for now as we don't really know each other, something could happen in future"". So I said ""Okay, I thought it was something I did or that you liked someone else"", she said ""Nah it was nothing you did and there is nobody else"". I said ""Okay, well I'm sorry for trying to rush things. I can wait until we know each other a bit better"", she said ""It's fine :)"". 
Anyway all this week (That all happened last weekend) we have been talking on Skype each night from like 10pm-2am. Two nights ago she was over mine again and we were both on my bed right next to each other. I thought she was trying to hold my hand so I moved my hand closer to hers (touching her finger tips) and she started to hold my hand. We held hands all night. 
Anyway
After they went home EVERYONE went on Skype together. I went for a walk with a backpack full of booze and got pissed. She was texting me asking where I was and to cut a long story short
¬¬¬¬¬¬
Anyway I'm really confused. I am absolutely crazy about her and want things to work out. She's going away for a week tomorrow so won't see her until next Monday, please.

I've read many times that a guy should not give advice to a girl when she's telling about her problem, as I'm actually used to give advices all the time.

Let's take a simple example: girl tells about her week-long conflict with her mother and that she is very nervous about it. 

What is the best thing a guy could say?

1. Tell her 'Everything is going to be alright' or similar stuff. (Sounds kind of dull)
2. Tell her 'Everything is going to be alright, etc. etc.' (Not as dull as previous one)
3. Same as 2 but in addition add a story like ""I once had a long time conflict with my mother ... ... but it the end she was happy to see me again"" (This is what I choose to tell).
4. Some other reply?

Again, then what kind of response would be bad?

On thursday, and then having quite a few more drinks. I'm really terrible at flirting, so I basically just told her ""order what you like, and I will try that"" for most of the night.

Our server was super cute

The most covert method we figured out was to ask her when the bill came ""Hey

Here's where it gets a bit weird. She'd been giving us the bill when this happened, do you guys just bet on the ugly ones, or..?"". I fell all over myself saying ""no, no - he's more of an optimist than I am, and I think you're cute"" (or at least, something along those lines - the memory's a little hazy).

As we sat and considered our drink tab

Because I was paying with a debit card, I said ""Hey, I'd like to get to know you better. Can I buy you a coffee sometime?"". She thought about it, smiled, and said ""Sure"". At this point, my drunk self went ""great!...but I'll need your phone number to set it up. Can I have that?"". She gave me her number, and joked about whether I'd remember it in the morning - to which I responded ""I will text it *right now* so I don't forget"". She laughed

This is the text I sent her:

""Hi &lt;cute server&gt;

That was thursday night, I did. No response - and I learned she doesn't have an answering machine, which means I have no idea whose phone number I actually have.

I tried again today at 1:00 or so - no answer again

""Hey &lt;cute server&gt;, you can reach me at &lt;my number&gt; anytime.""

..And that's where I'm at

If I still get no response tomorrow, and I'm not even sure I've got the right number. What should I do?

Also, he says, she'll either approach me and talk, or ignore me completely - and then I'll know completely and for sure.

I guess what I'm saying is - I'm not sure what to do here. What should I do?

I've been told my standards are too high by some women who I've gone on a date with, yet I can't seem to get a date.

Basically, is kind and has a nice smile (okay, that last one isn't me), and isn't fat/greasy, by virtue of either working out or playing a sport or just minding what they eat?

I thought I had a pretty good personality and a wide set of interests, so... I guess it's you who I'm going to invest my energy, time, and money into."" In the end, it comes out that there's a reason I wasn't really chasing them in the first place, and it falls apart because I'm not that interested.

It sucks that I'm not being given any choice in who I date, with all but one of my girlfriends, I'd have picked someone else at the time who I was interested in, and every time, they had already shot me down.

I've tried out just about every method of asking someone out- I've tried the complete stranger method, and her head shook back and forth violently, as quickly as she could make it as she goes ""no. No no. Uh... no..."" as if I were threatening her or had just offered to take a knife to something she loved. She seemed legitimately scared of my offer to care for her. I'm not offering them my heart, I'm not desperate to the point of ""HERE IS MY HEART NOW TAKE IT DAMMIT!""

Well, we were in a group of friends and didn't talk much and he was dating someone at the time. Fast forward two years (to last year) and he admits to casually creeping on me for the last couple years and that he couldn't believe I'd actually talk to a guy like him etc etc etc. 
Long story short, my interest in them multiplies tenfold. But this guy seemed to be everything I was looking for and it was just fantastic. We were on constant contact the next few months, but it slowed after a while. Now, we don't talk too much at all but my feelings still haven't changed. He's mentioned that he absolutely abhors texting and is rather short with me lately, but I don't know if I should connect that to his hating texting or not wanting to talk to me.

However

* bars in NYC seem to be mostly couples. Been going to all sorts of bars every night of the week for two weeks all over Williamsburg and the LES.

Some people think Meet-up groups rock

* Meetup groups tend to be heavy on lonely dudes. Not helping me much.

* Meetup groups seem like an inappropriate place to go looking for a date.  

Some people insist I should speed date.

* seems kind of desperate and weird.

I am on a diet so I am choosing reddit over a Ben &amp; Jerry's Chocolate Fudge Brownie.

I am 27 year old and I have never dated my whole life. Ever.  I am even older than Josie Gellar when she got kissed.  This is really sad

I’ve always wanted it but never knew what I was missing.  

That is until last week

I never told anyone that I kept an online dating profile because it embarrasses the heck out of me.  Although

I have always been an introvert.  I never got asked out my whole life, homeless people and weird, weird guys.  So when I saw him the first time in a dimly lit sidewalk, I was taken aback.  Fuck, he’s too pretty for me!  And not to mention, one foot taller.  I wanted to run away but I can’t stop staring at his face.

This is the first date I've ever had in my whole life and it was perfect.  He was funny, it was in his house.  We started watching a documentary, and in  a couple hours or so, we were lying on the carpet facing each other, 6 inches a part. Nothing happened.  He did not try anything except feel my back and my waist.  He did not even try to kiss me.  It felt so good but I still felt safe.  I have watched and read this scenario a thousand times, be it in the movies, pocket books or dramas.  I am from an Asian household where I was raised very conservatively.  What I was doing at that very moment was something I have never picture myself doing.  It was only the second date and here I am being felt all over my back.  When I got home

I signed up on that website so I can meet my soulmate.  I was looking for someone with a decent job, but I doubt it.  He is more decent than that.  However, I am fully aware that he will not stay in my city forever.  I was in a dilemma.  Should I just continue and see where it goes?  Take it as experience?  Or should I stop and continue my search?  Why would I invest my heart in a relationship that may not amount to something?  Although I secretly yearn for a Korean drama love story,  I believe myself to be a practical person and I was leaning on the second choice.

I have never dated anyone so I had no idea what a normal relationship should go like.  He knows I am inexperience and is very careful around me.  The fourth time I have met him, I think I am torturing him, but he contained his lust and did not try anything at all.

That night

He said

“I talked to them about it, are you looking for a short fling…for casual…for casual…”  I did not continue.  I cannot.  It was stuck in my throat.

Ah

Today marks the 7th day since I’ve met him.  He never replied to my morning text which he usually does.

So

I have a big lump in my tummy.  The same lump I felt the morning after our first date.  But this time

-Am I slipping into the ""Friend Zone""?

-How can I (someone who can't ask someone out to save my own life) make an opportunity to make some sort of move? She is always really busy when I'm in there.

Anyway

Overall, which I am fairly proud of. I did have a hard time with my stutter, but she was more than patient and was pretty cool about it. I had confirmed the date with her the night before and had texted her the address, to which she didn't respond. It's actually been pretty hard to start a conversation with her over text, as she's very busy at her job. It can be difficult to do so in the evenings as well.

With all that said, as was cold and rainy out all day. She offered to pay part of the bill, left right after dinner to do laundry and grocery shopping, and I never really got a romantic vibe off of everything. In the end, I walked her back to her car but lost my chance to get a hug. 

Now, even though at the moment I would prefer something more romantic. One of the biggest achievements seems to be that feeling like I need to prove something to her has disappeared, which is great. I'm hoping that that continues.

Even so

**1)** I would like to send her a funny, though, since she was in casual clothes and it sounds *really corny.*

**2)** Even with the ""this-is-a-friend-date"" vibe I got off of it all

**3)** This probably sounds a little silly, but I just couldn't figure out how to offer one without being awkward.

**4)** Do I need to explicitly clarify my intentions versus her intentions (e.g. telling her forthrightly that I like her)?

1. Where can I meet more ""weird"" girls. This sounds like a dumb question I know, think the same. Where could I more easily find girls more on the more indie/intellectual/artsy/nerdy side??

2. How do I go about arranging a second meetup?? I'm pretty confident and not bad looking, I've never been good at setting up a future. The simple ""we should meet up again sometime"" oftentimes gives the certainty of flirting and intimidates them into saying no. I don't really know how else to go about it though. Mondo help needed on this one.

We never had sex but spent the night at each others' houses a couple times a week for a few weeks. Eventually, the communication died.

About a month ago

So for the past month or so, hanging out for a while, then eventually going to bed together. She has told me countless times how ""amazing"", ""so great"", and how much she ""really likes me."" Unfortunately it's usually when she's been drinking but she has told me (when sober) that she does feel more comfortable around me than she does other guys and its rare that this happens.

I've been told that i just need to keep taking it casual with her because of her long relationship and when she's ready something might happen.. though it feels like I'm being friend-zoned. I think i just need to get to know her more by hanging out with her and her friends.

Today I realized that we wont meet up for 2 more weeks and got really depressed. How and how much should I communicate with her during that time to show her that I like her and to not appear as too pushy or needy? During today's talk I said ""I'd really like to see you more often""

I want to try out online dating sites

First of all

Here is a list of types of girls that look suspicious to me. Should I contact them anyway or they are not what I need? Any more types I missed?

1. The girl mentions ""long-term relationship"" but **also** ""flirt""
2. The girl has tonns of presents
3. The girl looks very good and has registration date 3+ years ago but also is active (kind of makes me think she is here only for messaging). This type usually comes with number 2.
4. The girl did not bother to fill out any of her interests or info and only added 1-2 photos. Also answering rate is awfully low (5-10%) (some dating sites show it).

Also some general questions:

1. When is it best to ask for a phone number/appoint a date? Day of communication
2. After asking for a phone number - she rejected. Should I continue communication or is it a dead end?
3. In general
4. Several times I was trying to write long messages to some girls and they started to respond with long messages too. With one of them - our message length went to half a page of text. Did she really find it interesting talking with me
5. Any tips on how girls behave in online dating sites when they are interested in a guy? Some key questions maybe? Overall style of communication?

Last week a friend asked if I wanted to go out with a girl he knew

When I take her back to the dorm on campus she was living at (we both go to same university) we hang out for most of the rest of the day with some mutual friends. Pretty much all of which are gay guys. At this point it's not going fantastic

A few days later and I end up crashing at our mutual friends place for 2 days which she hangs out there constantly. So at this point for a few hours each day I'm in the same room as her, listening to head phones, browsing the internet. I come to find out later that she failed her chemistry course for the second time so I figure she must be going through a rough time. She also went home this week and I overheard her say that her dad is an asshole so I'm guessing she doesn't really enjoy going home. 

Overall I'm just kinda confused. I'm pretty sure she likes me or at least did. Idk if she's just kinda depressed about all the things that are happening or if I've started to bore her (I've had trouble trying to talk to her becaue I'm a bit shy myself and she doesn't seem to bring much to the conversations) or what. I thought maybe I should try cheering her up but I don't really know her well enough to know how to do that.

I'm just kind of frustrated at myself for not being able to have better conversations (pretty sure I did miss a few opportunuites) but also at the situation because I just don't know what to do from here.

I went on a date last night that led to this idea that I'm going to share with all of you

But first the backstory about myself and last night- 

I believe in not doing things halfassed. This shows in my work, not under contract, started to show a little interest in me, so how do I show her I like her? With last minute tickets to a big sold-out show she'd said she wished she could go to, that's how! She had to be at least a little impressed. 

It wasn't a bad date as dates go

Then in the morning, so why not try to find some way to use Reddit like a dating site? 

What I've got is a little bit of knowledge

Suppose I were to post this as a *reward* with rules and conditions like a dating contest show? My first question is which Subreddits would it go in? This one I guess

I have in mind a series of elimination rounds to preserve my privacy and that of any girls responding who might be interested. Correspondence would be private but I could post updates for spectators.
It might go something like this:

Round 1=
Any and all girls reply to my initial post titled something like ""Who wants a beach vacation date with a cute guy?"" They reply with a simple

Round 2=  
I message each respondent back with more info about me

Round 3=
p3oPLE whO riTe LIKE THIS r emlinited

We trade photos. 

Round 4=
Someone posts my photo in the thread after I've asked them to please not do so. If there are enough upvotes some of my friends will recognize me and we'll have a good laugh. 

Round 5=
E-mail, and consideration of schedules and ability to meet in person for a face to face conversation. I may be able to travel just for that. 

That's where I'm still mulling over the details. Of course I don't want to take too much of a chance and wind up vacationing with a psycho hosebeast. One quick meeting with a girl who sticks with all this game show bullshit would be enough for us to clinch it and make me feel good about inviting her out. Also as a diving partner she may very well be in a position to kill me!  

However if there are more than two girls who I want to meet in person and check out, like New York City?

Well in the program there was about 35-45 people total and we all got along great. We all stayed in one dorm and hung out with each other and bonds were made very quickly. Well about 2 days into the program I notice this girl...and I find her extremely attractive! So we start to hang out and we exchange phone numbers. Well we talk everyday just through meeting and I start to develop a crush on said girl. Well one night after being flustered by small annoyances I decided to go for a run. Everyone was surprised by this because my physical stature shows that I am not in the best of shape.( note; I'm not to terribly out of shape but it shows) Well the girl says gimme five and I'll go get my shoes and I'll go running with you! I reluctantly say yes! And a few of my friends ask if I have a crush on her and I told them yea I do. They all laugh and chat about it and the girl comes outside and we go running. I bust my ass for this girl. We even walk another lap around campus and then retreat to our dorms for the rest of the night. Well the next day after lunch we decided to head to the dorm to go grab a few things and start talking about crushes and one of my friends goes I think that Trey(me) has a crush on M( the girl). I heavily blush and say maybe..and the girl says maybe I guess we will never know and we continue our walk. Well the next night we go on a walk in a big group and we decided to have a few races along the way

After the academy was over I started to text her and we had been constantly flirting and conversing over the past week but lately her texts have dwindled to less and less. And to my knowledge I never texted anything creepy because I was very careful in what I texted.

We were only open a few hours a week and we were really busy all the time, and when I finally worked up the nerve

I ended up adding her on Facebook (September of 2010), so I mostly stuck to commenting on or liking my statuses. And for awhile, she was basically liking ever status I put up over the next few months. Not having the confidence I have now and lacking any concrete signals, I didn't ask her to talk on the phone or on Skype or anything.

We're now in Spring of 2011

I wen to her party and had a really good time. We didn't talk as much as I wanted since I was careful not to monopolize her time. She was only in town for a few days, but she actually had plans for the next few days since she only had a few days in town anyway. I wondered whether this was rejection or if she really didn't have time.

Fast forward a few months to now. I finally asked her to Skype and she agreed to this. We have chatted once and I feel like it was a good time. And we have been interacting on Facebook more as well. She has tagged me in a few comics and we've playfully been bantering back and forth.

I am considering just telling her how I feel because I fear that I have worked so hard to not seem clingy or creepy that I have been too subtle about my intentions. Considering that she is in another state and that I probably won't be able to see her in person until maybe December or even March

I am basically looking for an interpretation of the signals I described above. She used to comment on my stuff on Facebook a lot with me barely saying anything. Then she pulled back and I started commenting on her stuff. Was she interested at first and now only sees me as a friend? Or do I have a chance with her?

tl;dr: Met a girl at work. She moved away for school. We got to know one another on Facebook over the course of a year and only met in person once. We have Skyped once.

Fast forward to last Thursday, and to my surprise it worked.  She stayed for about an hour, but had to leave because of an early class the next morning.  While she didn't really show interest, we talked the entire time.  The only clue she gave is that she wanted to see Paranormal Activity 3, which I didn't realize until today.  So I started texting her and after a couple text I ask if she has seen the movie yet, and of course she already had.  I told her that I was actually just about to ask her to go see it with me and she said ""I'm sorry :( I would have totally loved going to see it with you"".  We talked about the movie a little more and I asked if their might be another movie she wants to see and she says ""none that are out right now"".

I'm over my fear of rejection (I guess facing your mortality really puts shit in perspective) but I don't really know how to ask her out.  Could I have fucked up my last chance?  Their isn't a lot to do in my town so any and all suggestions are appreciated.

Sometimes things don't work out.  It's part of the dating ritual.  I didn't get any good advice, so one thing I learned from posting here: no one uses r/dating.  One thing I learned from my date: Oronoco is an amazing light rum.

Edit2: *update*.  She wrote me back saying she was sorry, I hope she doesn't take me up on that offer.

Bottom line is I met a girl a few weeks ago. Funny thing is she is a waitress at a bar I frequent. Last time she served me I slid her my card in with the check. Sure enough the next day she texted me a hello. Last Wednesday we went out for some drinks with friends and I think it went well. That night
Its been so long since I have had anyone show me any interest that I do not want to come off as too desperate and turn her off to me.

I met a girl a few months ago when one of my housemate's friends brought over his girlfriend to a party we were having, that is my only option for communicating with her right now. Does striking up a conversation via an instant messenger and ending it by suggesting that she go on a date with me hurt my chances? Would it be better if I asked her friend for her phone number so I can call her?

If the date went poorly I could understand this

* Are they expecting the guy to always be the one to send messages?

* Is there some kind of unwritten rule about this?

* Are they trying to play games to see how interested in them I am or what kind of hoops I'm willing to jump through for them?

Some of them have been drop-dead gorgeous so maybe that's the kind of attention they're used to? Any insight would be greatly appreciated!

1299568272.0,fzlzt,Le boyfriend has a close female friend who is in love with him.  HELP.,throwawayacct324,3,2,8,"OK

I've been seeing my boyfriend for about 9 months now.  We are very keen on each other and so far we've been very happy.  There is one thing about the boyfriend that bugs me though

Alice has been friends with my boyfriend for about a decade now.  They've never had any romantic entanglements

I first met Alice and her boyfriend on the third date with my boyfriend.  It was a double date and I liked her and her boyfriend as much as anyone can like their significant other's friends.  At first she was very warm and inviting

Alice and my boyfriend talk all the time, most of that is also when I'm seeing Alice and her boyfriend.  Lately, the invitations to do things have been dwindling.  There will times when I ask the boyfriend what his plans are for a night and he'll say that he has nothing going on but wants a quiet night in, when he'll go and hang out with Alice and her boyfriend.

OK

That's what I thought until one night when I was spending time with Alice in good faith without the boyfriend when she got rip-roaring drunk and went on a tirade to me about how she wants to be supportive of my boyfriend

I keep trying to tell myself that she meant that she loves him in the friendly way

It's not that I object to him having female friends.  Indeed, and, you know, she loves him.

I haven't mentioned anything to my boyfriend just yet about how much this bothers me

So, how would I go about phrasing my concerns?

1295962152.0,f8op8,Is this bullshit or what?,BeingDS,1,0,4,"So I've been writing back and forth to a girl on PoF.com lately. We've been talking for a couple of weeks, since I didn't want to scare her off by asking for her number (I never did understand that about chicks online. You can be hitting it off and have tons of shit in common

So in record time (she usually takes about 2-3 days to respond) I get this gem:

&gt;I'm sorry I can't do this right now. I feel like I owe you an explanation because you seem like a nice guy. I orriginally wrote one out but it's really much more than you need to know. Long story short

&gt;Best of luck to you!

My first instinct is that this is bullshit; that she dug around on my Facebook page

However, then I'd like to try and be supportive. But if she's just being a bitch without the integrity to be honest about what's bothering her, then I don't want anything to do with her.
