Basically, and not wearing it well. After a lot of thinking and some objective thinking, I realized I need to do something about this. I've started with the common sense stuff - ""Get yo' salad, no dessert"" as Kanye once said - but although the food stuff is going well, I need to team it with exercise. That's where the question comes in. 

I used to ride when I was younger (And a tiny bit slimmer) and I used to get shouted at by strangers about how my bike is about to collapse. I know some of it was piss-taking since my butt can't actually swallow a bike seat (...where would it go?) but I'm still nervous if I'm actually too fat to ride a bike. 

Is there a weight limit or anything? Any insight would be awesome.

&gt; I considered depreciation of 20% per year for a bicycle which is based off the average life of 5 years.
I took a depreciation of 80% which leaves an ACV of 20% of the current replacement cost since the bicycle is over 5 years old.
20% of ACV of $3

Depreciation rate seems high

As of late, I can save on gas, car maintenance and invest in my health as well/. The more I looked in to cycling though, I saw all the cool things you can do to bikes, such as adding panniers and lights, and gps and computers and other cool things. hell, I even saw cool spinning light attachments for the rims, considering that I work late and usually end up getting out around 11 or 12.

Only problem though is, I saw this [Huffy Savannah Bike at Walmart](http://www.walmart.com/ip/700c-M-Savannah-road-bike-model-56760-black/12517029) which appears to have really good reviews from people. I really dont know what 700c tires are, or whether this bike is right for me since every person I talk to keeps telling me ""GET YOURSELF MEASURED!!!!!"" But I dont have the money to get measured. I saw somewhere that was charging like 125 to measure me. I was like ""that is more than the bike I want!!""

Doesnt help that my dad has a Trek 52001 120 Carbon series, I've had other bikes when I was younger, but that was only to riding to my buddy's house down the block. So I dont know, is that bike good at all? I have seen some youtube videos on it, as well as other sites that give it good reviews. is a cheapy bike good to start off with or should I invest more money? Will I be able to upgrade pieces as I go? Sorry, I didnt see anything on the sidebar to help out the new people.

I was wondering if you guys think it would be worth the investment to get a road bike (probably in the ~$700-750 range). Do you think this is a good idea? Will I notice a big difference over my current bike? Is a road bike my best option

I grew up biking. My first bike was at age 4. My first job was at age 13 in a bike shop. I loved biking. every check I got went right back to the store for more parts as I built my own bmx from the mongoose frame

When I was about 15 i quit biking to start skateboarding. 
between age 15 and 30 I only had one bike

When I was 30 I got a job that I felt I could commute via bike to. My friend suggested a single speed bike since they are light weight, I was still a fixie hipster. I only used the bike for small errands, short distances, I ended up not using it for commuting at all because it turned out the road was too dangerous (motorist dangers, no bike lane).

I'm 32 now. I started a new job with HP a few months ago and was notified about a fund raiser, but I figured I'll give it a shot. I didn't have a geared road bike, but I figured I can just train on my single speed until I have enough money for a real road bike. GOOD LORD they are expensive! I spent a month checking craigslist every day for something my size, not aluminum (need comfort for 100mi ride), and within budget. Finally I found a deal! I bought a Specialized Allez Triple for $600! It is a little old, but for a first bike I think I did pretty good. This was last Friday. The next day I did a ride with some of the HP team, a cycling team called the vanderkittens, it was challenging

The century ride is on September 28th so this only gives me about 7 weeks (?) to train. With that in mind I decided I will commute on bike to work everyday. It is a 13.5 mile commute each way along a designated, it is scenic, it isn't all that challenging, and I get to practice for the century.

What I've noticed - There is a different kind of comradery amongst cyclists than say, a wave, a smile... On my road bike it is a completely different story. Everyone is super nice! Also, everyone is very careful about following the rules of the road and etiquette - not something I would associate with the fixie riders (i've seen enough sidewalk riding, crosswalk riding, wrong side of the road, running lights, but I like it.

Anyways, I'm going to need it! If anyone wants to make a donation here is the link - http://canary.convio.net/goto/ryanhatescancer

Safe to say, I panicked and ran outta there. I wasn´t wearing any underwear underneath my cycling shorts so there was a pretty visible stain on my shorts that would be hard to explain. But it is not like I had a proper piss. I have gone for a few more turns on the spinning cycle after that without incident, but I have also refrained from leaning forward.

I'll start off by saying that I haven't really ridden any bikes as an adult. I

I was surprised that he actually had the manual for the bike

My quick research suggests that this bike was at least $1000-$1500 brand new and still worth quite a lot. The copyright in the manual was from 1996

So, the grip tape is all deteriorated, so I'm sure I can replace that. Also also, the valve on the intertube is really small. I think the manual called it a presta valve. Any tips on pumps? Any thing else on the bike that you guys can point out would be great. I know very little about bikes and how they work. I'm not even entirely sure I know how the gear shift works on this thing!

Need Advice for When to Lift what in Conjunction with Cycling

I am pretty sure I need to change the order of my workout days. The problem - my Lower back especially but also glutes and hams are too sore.

I am using road biking for my fat burning/cardio 2x a week


**Here is my current workout schedule:**

M - Chest/Bis (Bench Press)

T - 50 minutes cycling in 16-18mph range

W - Back/Tris (Deadlifts)

Th - 50 minutes cycling in 16-18mph range

F - Legs/Shoulders (Squats)

  
  

**Here is the problem**

T - Cycling causes lower back strain due to bent over position as well fatigue on glutes and hams.

W - Deadlifts hit the posterior chain and fatigue the lower back

Th - Cycling (as above)

F - Squats clearly hit the glutes and hams (lower back is fine here) and then lunges clear up the rest of my ability to function.


**The result -**
 I walk like a weirdo way longer than the normal walk like a weirdo for a day after deadlifts that most guys I know deal with.

My goals: Get pain free while getting stronger at deadlifts and squats (neglected them for years) and lose 10 pounds.

I am trying to get things to line up so that I am not doing too much on a given day as I am running at around 2000-2300 calories a day vs 3300 maintenance (I am 6'6"" 250 looking to hit 240 soon). I can handle the deficit mentally

Taking all this into consideration

2. I need a bike as well. I'll mostly travel on roads like [this](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fM-LoBy57uo/TKVvAto83qI/AAAAAAAAOgA/5e7xNwugXtE/s1600/020920101765.jpg). What type of bikes are suitable for this? I have no plans to ride on the mountains. 
1. Any other tips or suggestions...

Let me know if you need more info.

Thanks in advance.

For that reason, I'm attempting to not only use the bike for commuting, but also for riding with friends on some longer and more road-based treks (Obviously harboring no notions that a beginner will be able to ride at their level with any sort of speed).

After consulting with many of them, a Marin Toscana: http://www.marinbikes.com/2011/bike_specs.php?serialnum=1175 ). It seems like the best fit for my needs at the moment.

The capacity and organization on this backpack is not bad, the laptop protection is great, the design is beautiful, but the toughness is nowhere near a true cycling bag.

1. won't shift around while riding
1. will protect my laptop with adequate padding and is weatherproof

**Chrome Welded Rucksack**: PROS - all of the above for Chrome. Laptop functions as a separate case with organizational loops. CONS - not expandable

**Timbuk2 Swig**: PROS - laptop pocket with side access and drop protection, cheap. CONS - the style is ""hip,"" not really my thing. I am more into the muted, minimal look.

**Timbuk2 Q**: PROS - same as above. CONS - same as above

**Mission Workshop Rambler**: PROS - doubles in size and compresses down very nicely, laptop compartment, very high quality stitching, urethane-coated zippers, super tough material, beautiful bag, lifetime warranty... and made in the USA. CONS - no organizational pockets, including the laptop compartment which means no drop protection. Expensive as hell.

I picked up an old Raleigh from the habitat for humanity store today and I'd like to restore it to rideable condition. The bike is in really remarkable condition given its age (~40 years); looking at the pads and normal areas of wear I'd even go so far as to say its never been ridden. 

That said there is some serious grime build up and the cables are pretty slack. My plan is to give it a proper strip down and cleaning, and the pads are dried out. 

The tricky part for me us that it has a sturmey archer internal 3 speed hub which I know nothing about maintenance for. It will go through the gears but takes way too much force to be healthy.

First
The kids are 5 and 9. Neither one of them are good bike riders yet and this is due mostly to the fact I haven't taken them out on their bikes as often as they like. I have a strong feeling the bikes they currently have are too small for them. According to this chart: http://bicycling.about.com/od/howtoride/a/bike_sizes.htm

Based on height instead of age, but I've also heard there's a structural difference in boy vs. girls bikes... something I'm not sure I understand or if it's really worth caring about since he'll outgrow it in a couple of years anyways. Feedback?

As I mentioned above

Now for me:
I'm trying to lose weight. I've been doing good at staying on a healthy diet and getting a modest amount of exercise on a daily basis which I have been slowly ramping up. Biking was on my to do list from day 1 and I'm about ready to bring it in. I have bad knees and my ankles don't support me doing running and walking for more than 2 miles. Biking is perfectly fit for me because it doesn't put more stress than my knees and ankles can handle and allows me to get out of the house. I'm at about 290 lbs and would be using the bike mostly for exercise purposes

And for my wife:
She is more overweight than I am, but I am skeptical that she'd ever join a bike-a-thon (but then she might suprise me). As with myself, I'm willing to invest a little bit more in a bike for her with long term expectations and all so I pose the same questions with her in mind....


**UPDATE:** So it turns out my in-laws have a pair of bikes they don't use. They were offered to us so I took them to the bike shop and the verdict is they are in pretty good shape. They need minor work that I can do myself and new tires so I'm ending up with a pair of road bikes for myself and my wife for less than $75 in parts.",self,t5_2qhyi,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/lxz2d/noob_question_bikes_for_the_whole_family/

I'm by no means a natural athlete and don't expect to win any races or anything.  I bike with some other guys and one thing I notice is how much I vary in performance day-to-day while everyone else seems far more consistent.  Maybe 10% of the time I can hang with them and pound up the hills ready for more.  40% of the time I'm having my 'normal' days - struggling along on the back end. 50% of the time I'm just way down and am embarrassed to be riding.  For the life of me I can't figure out what's wrong.  I've monitored sleep
  

My bad days are just this dreadful feeling of fatigue once I start riding.  Up until I start riding I have no idea if it will be a good or bad day.  I'm not particularly panting but my power is down for a given heart rate.  My legs usually feel fine

* Age = 39
* Weight = 150
* Very regular headaches  (tension/tmj)
* Relatively poor lung capacity - probably due to pneumonia when I was young.  
* After a hard ride I can have phlegm in my throat that causes me to cough and hack for a few hours.  But during my ride I don't feel like I'm wheezing or short of breath.  I got an asthma inhaler but it made no difference.
* Testosterone level tested as normal
* Food allergy test didn't turn up anything.
* It's not lack of calories

I know you aren't doctors

Today I was riding with my cycling partner and we ran into some highwaymen. We were riding close together maybe, I was able to disengage a little bit, so the damage to the bike wasn't extremely severe.

Another cyclist stopped by to make sure everything was ok, helped the actor to the grass with the actor's friend, all the while I fixed my rim so I could ride home.

I am completely new to cycling so apologies if I sound clueless. I am currently on the look-out for a bike that will get me to/from work (3 miles each way ~ a few hills but mostly flat) and through a 50-mile charity ride. I would love to be able to buy myself a commuter bike and a road bike but I am currently a graduate student. 

I have looked through Craigslist and there appear to be no decent bikes in the 52/53cm range in my area. If they are decent

After speaking with people at the local bike shop

I have a few options based on bikes available at local shops. The only bike that I have tried (on this list)  is the Fuji Absolute 2.1. 

* '13 Fuji Absolute 2.1 (with discount should be ~ $410)
* '13 Trek Verve 1 (~$470 including taxes)
* '13 Trek 7.1 FX ($500 with taxes)
* '13 Giant Cypress ($370 with discount)

The good thing about the Fuji lies in the fact that the bike shop is super-close to me and the people there were great. (I can't praise them enough about their service.) If anything were to go wrong

In the end this bike will probably end up being my commuter bike

I've been looking into power meters for some time now. Researching everything I can. In fact my PI is probably a little upset about how much time I spend looking at all of the options out there.

After looking at all 4 types (ibike newton, power tap hub) I noticed that all give a different reading or interpretation of the cyclists power. ""Duh!"" you might be saying by now. But look at the different types. One is responsive in a forward direction, another responsive in the reverse direction, and two are what you exert or what you put into the bicycle itself.

So which one do you choose? Well

I was thinking about some simple mechanics, and put back out. Things like mechanical resistance, flex, heat, other sources of friction, tangential forces... all kind of things between your feet and the back wheel that hits the road. Each part having some coefficient of absorption, portions of your effort are never used to move you forward. Minuscule, I suspect that for each bike there is a maximum transfer efficiency from foot to wheel and that is the best training zone for overall power efficiency. I haven't been able to try any as I'm on a graduate student income. 

It could be as simple using a crank and hub power meter to determine the ratio of power in to power out (≤1). You could potentially use all four types to see how much power is lost at the front of the bike.

So my question is - has anyone actually tried this? I've spent several hours trying different search phrases/key words

TL:DR? Has anyone used more than one power meter simultaneously in their training? This could be a neat way to follow your training.

        - cycling as of February this year
        - rock climbing as of March
        - comfortable with compound lifts such as the power clean

1) I'm aware that the power/weight ratio is generally better for smaller people. I think I'm a corner case here

2) How many feet should I climb per week?

3) Should I be on a 3 week cycle throught the training plan?

4) Would it be worthwhile to switch in other cardio such as rowing or running?

5) How often shoud I lift?

6) Should I do more or less miles?

It's been about 8 years since I've ridden my bike, and I think it may be time for me to invest in a bicycle. This will certainly be a healthier and more economical alternative to driving, but I have no idea where to start on my search. 

I do not expect to purchase a bike that will outlive me; I would like something reliable that could comfortably survive a few years of casual use. I expect to mostly ride on paved roads and some trails. I am trying to keep my cost at $300 or less, I may take the bike back to school with me come September. From what I know, hybrid or road bike may suit my needs. My friend recommends a mountain bike as a good all-rounder, and I've found some relatively inexpensive ""comfort"" bikes which I know very little about. What should I look for when picking a bike, this doesn't seem as simple as comparing numbers on some spec sheets.

I've been doing Starting Strength for the last three months and am making appreciable strength gains. I am still in novice land, which for me is usually five 100-mile rides, between two and four 125-150 mile rides and a bunch of smaller excursions (50-75 miles) in between. Thus, I would like to start focussing on my long-distance (100+ miles) endurance. I care much more more about finishing than finishing them quickly.
While reading Rippetoe/Kilgore's Practical Programming book, lower-weight (50-75% 1RM) movements help improve muscular endurance while allowing for strength gains on strength-building days. The way I'm reading this, this means that if I want to be fit and ready for the summer, I can (or should be) programming my rest days for this lighter work while continuing to use the Monday/Wednesday/Friday split for the Starting Strength programme and topping it off with a nice, long (50 - 100 miles) ride on the weekend.



Is this way too much work? If it is not, as these exercises seem most applicable to my sport. Is this a good idea? Or should I just stick to an hour on the trainer on my off days?

I'm trying to stay firm on my intent to do this ride but the guilting has gotten out of control.  They have been through a few tragic deaths and are beside themselves as to why I would ever consider putting myself in any type of risky situation. What additionally doesn't help is that they had the unfortunate experience of seeing a biker get hit in a freak accident.

I've looked up accident reports and statistics and have noticed that a larger portion of accidents that I expected are the result of the biker not adhering well enough to the rules of the road/having alcohol in their system/trying to maintain high visibility/etc.  This leads me to believe that if you take every precaution and pay attention (particularly in intersections) there's a good chance you'll remain unscathed. And of course I'm not saying drivers aren't at fault

I purchased this bike a few months ago and haven't done anything with it yet. This is more so out of fear of damaging anything as the person who sold it to me did so at a great price and for a specific reason. He wanted to see this bike back to its old self and not parted out. When I purchased it

Almost everything on the bike was Campagnolo Nuovo Super Record. The seat, or identifying aspects besides the badge. There is a Columbus seal on the seat tube. The badge has a portrait of a man with Romolo Lazzaretti arching over the top and smaller unreadable text. On the bottom of the badge there's a small wolf facing left.

I'm looking at getting a cyclocross bike with my cyclescheme voucher over the next month.  I had originally decided on a Genesis Croix de Fer, so I'm after some opinions on what to get.

So far my choices are:

* Genesis Vapour - £900.  Aluminium body
* Kona Jake the Snake - £1250.  Aluminium body
* Giant TCX 1 - £1200.  Aluminium body

Four times a week I cycle somewhere between 30 and 40 miles at full speed; no coasting except for when the downhill is too steep to sensibly pedal. My bike is a Kona MTB with slicks because my routes usually include a couple of miles of fields. I usually eat and drink the right stuff beforehand and take about 1.5 litres of water on my bike. Occasionally I go cycling having eaten nothing so as to prepare for bonking

So that's me. I'd really appreciate it if the experienced cyclists on here would do their best to answer the following questions for me

1/ How much extra effort will it be to complete a century without stopping?

2/ How do I carry extra water? I use almost all of my water during my normal cycles and I don't want to dehydrate

3/ I'll be using energy liquids and gels of course. How much should I take?

4/ Can I expect to be walking the next day?

I'm 25 and a college student.  When I registered for fall classes a few weeks back, and its too late to change my schedule.  I've decided to tough it out, and bike to school.

A little backstory-I got diagnosed about 3 months ago with arthritis in my left hip.  I was running before that 2.5 miles several times a week

My college is 8-9 miles away, one lane for each direction (not sure of speed limit, probably 35).  Neither has much of a shoulder or a bike lane (think *maybe* 8 inches to the right of the line).  There are no trails or other practical ways to get there.

So-pointers and advice please!  

-General safety tips
-Tips on riding on narrow roads with traffic
-How to seek out the best routes (I've scoured the Internet but maybe there's something I missed?)
-Tips on riding in the rain 
-Good tips/links on how to easily change the tire on a mountain bike with multiple gears?
-How afraid should I really be? (I'm *really* freaking scared)


I don't have funds to buy a bunch of equipment.  Right now I have the bike (a mountain bike), replacement inner tube, a small wrench for tire changes, and patch kit for the road in case I need to do repairs, plus maybe carrying a very small medical kit.  I already have tire levers.

I've looked at simply getting another set of Contis, and heavy as hell.  My LHT doesn't need any help on the ""heavy"" front, but the tires do need to be able to handle the kind of abuse I'm dishing out.  I'm okay with any size from 26x1.25 - 1.75, but I'd like to stay under 2 inches wide.  

I did recently buy my sister a set of Specialized city tires for Christmas

It's an 80's Reynolds 301 frame (Peugeor Galibier). The rear derailer exploded quite a while back and as a cheap repair I got a cheapo Shimano derailer and a rear wheel with an old-style freewheel (rather than a cassette). The front wheel is still the original Rigida that came with the bike.

Wouldn't mind upgrading the wheelset to a lighter and sportier pair. Almost all decent wheels use a cassete rather than a freewheel. I have been looking at Mavic Aksium as they seem good value.

Is there any reason why a cassette rear wheel won't work with my bike and derailer? My current wheel has 7 gears (derailer can go up to 9 or 10 I think) but there are cassettes with 8 gears.

1) I own a Carrera Subway 1 (a 2008/9 model) and its listed as a hybrid bike. It seems pretty robust and I've spent some time and money on it

I can post full specs if required.

2) If its a bad idea to put my faith in this bike

I'd consider myself a serious hobbyist, but I may commute on it some. 

I've only ridden aluminum and steel at this point and pretty much only $1000-range Cannondale and Specialized road and a bianchi cx bike. But

What I want: 

* Drive train: 

    I want something that's at least 105 on Shimano, I'm really hesitant to do shimano at all. No real love for Campy, but I've never ridden it for very long. And I don't want to have to change batteries, not that I want to afford DI2 anyway. 

* Frame: 

    I kind of like more classic lines than, though. 

    I don't mind aluminum. I don't want to wast energy, but I do ride in a city (Atlanta). I don't want something so fragile I can't hop those big metal slabs, bad speed bumps, or pot holes. I'm kind of afraid of CF as a result. 

* Ride: 

    Really, firm saddle...which I know I'll have to buy separate. 

* Bars: 

    It's probably too much to ask for, since I appear to be in the minority. 

* Looks: 

    No stupid colors. Celeste would be fine

Any suggestions? 

Update: 

I went to an LBS for lunch and rode a couple cannondales (caad 10 105, and a scott (CR1 Team, 105). The Scott seems to have won out of them, but the caad 10 was close. I hit some dirt in a corner and almost bailed on the synapse...kept it up, but it just didn't respond fast enough. Could have been the crappy stock tires, but it still didn't feel right. Domane might have bene *too* comfortable. The CR1 seemed like a good middle ground, but $2100 seems like it might be a lot for a 105 bike

After riding several

I'm also even more sketched by Shimano. All the way up to Ultegra, but they just didn't feel that much more right for the money. 

I guess what I'm looking for is aggressive but not too twitchy and Sram Force or Rival (or a mix). And I need to check on my insurance


Update 2: 

I've decided that Sram is worth more than Carbon to me. I was comfortable on Alu before, I feel like they work better for quick test rides without all my gear, but without being able to go on a nice, long high-speed test ride...that's not something I want to change that much.

I have recently moved to London and acquired a Raleigh stowaway bike. It's same as this one: http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2759/4237062456_eb9e83645d_o.jpg

I rode BMX for many years

1/ Does anybody know how strong the bike is

2/ How could I mod this bike to make it stronger? I've already put new large peddles on, and that long direction shaft seems to me as it's the weak point of the bike. Any suggestions?

How do I figure out what type of extractor I need to use? Is there a way to safely get the bracket assembly out without using an extractor?
