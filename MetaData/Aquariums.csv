I work at a pet store and on a busy Saturday while I was cleaning out the hermit crab terrarium this woman came up to me and asked ""aside from bettas and goldfish what can you keep in a bowl."" Immediately I corrected her that goldfish shouldn't be kept in a bowl. Her response? ""Tell that to my three year old goldfish I've been keeping in a bowl."" I then went on to tell her that they can live 20-25 years so by saying it lived 3 years isn't much. If it dies next year thats practically a 5th of its life. She then turned around and said to her husband ""I don't want to talk to this guy"" and stormed off. 2mins later she came back and asked my name. I told her. Still haven't heard anything back about that. 

Sorry you didn't like my answer. I'm not gonna congratulate you for killing your fish. Your fish has lived less than a 5th of its life. Thats like saying ""well my son had a good run
