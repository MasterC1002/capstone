A bit of a back story for context: I was a geology major in college and really took a liking to mineralogy and petrology but due to financial issues, unemployed (minus an art business I have started up to help with a bit of extra income while I'm waiting for ANY call back from a job). I have been clinically depressed for over 10 years and have serious anxiety problems (I'm in the processes of getting medical help so that's not an issue). 

Being so wrapped up in my depression, like a wall is put up in front of you and you can't break through it or climb over it (I hope that made sense). 

ANYWAY, gneiss, calcite and quartz crystals, plus many things I have yet to ID. I have **no idea** why, after 5 years of geology courses (and local field trips), I never thought to look in our area for minerals or fossils. We've been going on hikes at these parks for over 15 years and I never once thought to rockhound. Geocaching sure, but for some reason I didn't think we had anything special around here even though we have major rivers and reservoirs and are right next to the Great Lakes with tons of glacial till. **It wasn't until I subscribed to this sub that my life changed**. 

Well, I have an addiction to it now) with rockhounding for 3 reasons. 

1. You're finding amazing treasures from millions of years ago and can *hold it in your hand*. How INSANE and AMAZING is that??
2. It's been *unbelievably* therapeutic for my anxiety and depression (and is WAY cheaper than a therapist and antidepressants lol). I haven't been suicidal or cut since I started hounding. With the way life has been for us for the last 5 years (illnesses
3. I get to spend quality bonding time with my husband. He doesn't see all of the things I find amazing like I do

In any case, even if it's just quartz or slag, you've saved a life. **Thank you**, from the bottom of my heart. 

**edit**: I just wanted to add one more thing. I really look forward to posting my finds here to show them off and to get some help with ID's. Looking forward to that gives me great comfort in a time when I don't have that feeling very often :)

**edit #2**: I also forgot to mention that I have learned *so much* from everyone here. I can ID rocks much better than I used to be able to and certain things click now that didn't before

**edit #3**: I knew this would be the right place to post this. Thank you *all* so much for your support and words of encouragement. I wish I could express how much posting this and reading your responses have helped me and brightened up my month! I was hesitant to post this but I am beyond glad I did. You guys rock (pun intended) :) Thank you again and I look forward to posting some pieces soon!

**tl;dr: this sub got me into rockhounding after 6 years of being away from the field and 10+ years of severe depression and anxiety and it has saved my life. Thank you :)**",self,t5_2rbfx,1376849202.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/rockhounds/comments/1kloqs/i_know_this_isnt_the_typical_post_here_but_i/

1374690715.0,1iz0ge,Is it a meteorite? A quick guide to self-identification of your meteorwrong.,Sloth269,33,4,7,"In the past 6 months or so

My background: I am a researcher at a major American research institution with a meteoritics group. I deal with public inquiries on a daily basis

Meteorite realities: In the last twenty years

So where are meteorites found? Almost all meteorites nowadays are found in deserts

So how do you know it is quickly not a meteorite? If it has holes in it, whatever, it is not a meteorite. It is either slag or terrestrial. Simply put, no air in space=no bubbles.

Other things that will immediately tell you it is not a meteorite include the following:
Layering/laminations, thick crust, presence of quartz,  planar veins, fractures, and many many other things.

By far the best site for meteorite ID online is found [here](http://meteorites.wustl.edu/realities.htm)

How to get a good response from an expert:
The best way to get a response from an expert is to be polite and thorough. Tell me what research you did that made you think it is a meteorite. Show me you did your homework and I will gratefully tell you why you are probably wrong. You should include several well lit photos from multiple angles. Include something for scale! Tell us where you found it. Be as specific as possible. If possible

When writing your request your ID

Example of what not to do:
Can u give me a call at xxxxxxxxxhow can I get my meteorite certifieD my name is xxxxxx u can call me xxxx thank u

That is an actual email I received in the last week. You should try to make the ID request as painless as possible for the person. I will not find time to play phone tag with you about your meteowrong and it is nearly impossible to do IDs over the phone anyhow.

Another thing to not do is email the entire meteorite community in one go. Seeing all our colleagues emailed in one shot just means we will all ignore you and/or assume some one else answered you.

Finally, but telling me I am wrong is not going to win me over. We really do know what we are doing for the most part.

Another big thing to remember is that all rocks that fall from the sky are not meteorites. The FAAs dirty little secret is how often stones will get caught in airplane tires and fall off when landing gear is deployed.  Yeah

Feel free to ask me any questions about meteorite ID or the process that goes in to classifying/confirming a meteorite!

[Album](http://imgur.com/a/7VmC0)

Rock hunting is a bit of a thing in my family, my mom remembered that my great-grandmother had related to her in that one year, she had found a meteorite. She had cut it in half with her lapidary saw and donated one piece to her local Natural History museum. My family thinks this may be the other half of her meteorite.

Resident geologists

The rock has a volume roughly that of a grapefruit
It is black, is attractive to magnets and seems to be speckled with a iron-bearing mineral (which are the parts the magnet sticks to the most).

I was backpacking across Australia years ago, and stayed there for a while. One day I was out walking the coastline and hiked up a hill with a viewpoint. I could see far to the north there was a semi hidden secluded cove with a high cliff face all around it. I started heading toward that cove while walking along the waters edge collecting beach rocks and shells. The closer I got to the cove the quality of the rocks and shells got better. When I got to the edge of the cove there was a rock wall about chest high to climb over. Well where the rock met the beach it formed sort of a trap for debris that washed up. There were  polished rocks and shells all around. I noticed a few people were laying on the beach in the cove, but I was focused on the rocks. So I would crouch down to pick up a rock, stand back up, and repeat over and over. After a while two guys from the cove side came over the rock wall and walked past me. I smiled at them and nodded. They both looked at me like I was someone they would like to stab in the kidney as they walked past. I didn't think much of it, and I continue to collect stuff, and after a while someone else walks up behind me. He walks up to me and asks ""just what do you think you are doing?"" I tell him I am collecting rocks and shells, and says ""well you should know this is a nude beach

tl;dr I was collecting rocks and shells on a beach

First off, internally flawless, and a gorgeous deep red.

Next was a trip to a Pennsylvania locale known to have some dinosaur tracks.  Well

After that were a few trips to bone locations throughout Pennsy, so that was pretty neat.

After that, but it was easy and fun to find them and we all found some nice samples.  [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/g1vjSaP) the main collection, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/e2xmQUr) are my favorites from that trip.  Will be fun to wrap some and turn them into necklaces and whatnot.  Sorry for not providing a scale, they're pretty small though (the biggest is ~3cm).

The next trip was to a trilobite location.  The trilobite Phacops rana is PA's state fossil, with limonite all over them, some nice big [brachiopods](http://i.imgur.com/HosWca3), a hefty [mollusk](http://i.imgur.com/qNPAKGQ), and a very interesting death bed of bivalves, crinoids, bryozoans, and the like.  [Here's a photo from above](http://i.imgur.com/rdC0xuS) and [here's a close-up](http://i.imgur.com/2x2T0sr).

So yeah, feel free to add information or correct me if I have any ID's wrong, I'm no paleo buff.

Here are the rough mockups:

http://i.imgur.com/1ZD5901.jpg 

http://i.imgur.com/HULiCoL.jpg 

http://i.imgur.com/Fb3H7ag.jpg 

So the way I see it work is you are presented with some questions and as you answer them the number of possible rocks gets fewer and fewer

A member of a different forum suggested the identification process should be as follows:

1)  Metallic or non-metallic luster
2)  Mafic or Felsic 
3)  Hardness (Glass is a 5
4)  Cleavage
5)  Reaction to HCl
6)  Streak test

Any feedback on that? 

Also any feedback on the general direction? Would you use this sort of tool? I've had few other suggestions on what to create and I would like to create something that would benefit the largest amount of rockhounds,False,self,t5_2rbfx,False,,,t3_1fh1gz

What are some good ways to store/display his favorite rocks? Right now they are all together in a shoebox and bag under his bed.

I've learned a lot along the way, if it's alright with you, I thought I'd share some of the better pieces out of this set, and ask a few questions as well.

I'll label all the images in the imgur gallery, and any information would be great to know.

I collected all of these in Southwestern Manitoba. Most of the material is scattered on the gravel roads at the farm, I've heard you can finally actually enter them to rock hound again, so I've got plans to go to the pits directly next weekend and collect first hand, to see what else I can tumble.

Known minerals from these geodes are calcite, and dolomite.  Suspected are sphalerite, anhydrite and maybe others.  The area is a limestone formation (either the Maury shale, or the Warsaw formation).  The shales are soaked in oil (kerogen?) and sometimes when a geode vug was cracked open a light mineral oil would pour out.

I haven't had a job in three years

Recently, bored as hell and at this point I'm too broke to even get a job. So. I managed to bring a few goodies with me that I'd like to try selling. I need car insurance, new license plate tags and gas money (around $550), at which point at least I can drive to get a job or to rockhound up something good to sell, I don't know right now. I also need money to pay for treatment for depression, which at this time my parents are paying for, even though they live on a very limited income.

I don't even go for walks outside because I need new shoes and I don't want to wear these out. *sigh*

Anyway. On to the good stuff.

So

I grabbed a bottle of ""PH Down"", it worked beautifully, now I have half of them cleaned and I was saving all the largest pieces for last.  A 14 gallon rubber made container worth, full of big fat pods of calcite to remove.  But I ran out of acid.  So, off to the Hydroponic shop I went to get more.  A friend told me that I could get it much cheaper at the hardware store, but the stuff he had was this green glop, as opposed to PH Down's clear liquid.  But then, I saw that they sell DRY PH Down!  After doing a little bit of math, plus 6.2 pounds of water is nearly a gallon

Too bad the powder is Urea Phosphate.

Who the hell pissed in my acid?

Thomas Creek is famous for containing agates, so yeah, there's potential there. I've also snorkeled in the creek in the same area as the stump was found and pulled out ten+ pounds of wood a day there, but I've never been to the headwaters of Thomas Creek to look for anything...so I figured it was a good idea to have a look.

My Ore-Rock-On DVD shows a place WAY up Thomas Creek where one can supposedly find opalized leaf fossil prints

I tried looking for creek access points all along the way, and places where I could actually stop and take a look were all bedrock or rip-rap. No gravel. Lots of sand. -le sigh-

---

I stopped first in the town of Scio at a tiny city park along Thomas Creek and took a look at about 100 feet of scarcely-graveled riverbank. [Here's the haul](http://i.imgur.com/6selK.jpg): one yellow seam agate

---

Second stop was at Shindler's Bridge Drive on Thomas Creek, very little good stuff on the banks. Almost everything I found came out of the water, and the water was still kind of high.

---

Third stop: [as far as I could go out Thomas Creek Road](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=Scio,0.032852&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=44.71283,-122.610168&amp;spn=0.176885,0.525627&amp;z=12) along Thomas Creek. It's all riverfront property until the road turns to gravel, then another 500 feet further...and what do you know, [Weyerhauser's](http://i.imgur.com/60La2.jpg) actively logging and has [locked all the gates.](http://i.imgur.com/2AW2r.jpg) DAMMIT. Log trucks came through the [main gate](http://i.imgur.com/GxSoW.jpg) a few times while I was there and I could hear the horns of the logging equipment up the mountain from where I was, just like on Axe Men.

No opal leaf fossils for me. :(

[Looking upstream from the gated bridge](http://i.imgur.com/YAwPv.jpg)

[Looking downstream from the gated bridge](http://i.imgur.com/YAwPv.jpg)

There's good water flow (and that water was EFFING COLD)

I parked by the main gate and [searched a good 1/4 mile](http://i.imgur.com/thN5w.jpg) down [one side of the riverbank](http://i.imgur.com/uRsI5.jpg) for three hours, a rock with some blebs of common (non-precious) opal in it, two pieces of common opal/agate and three pieces of carbonized wood. [Here's the haul.](http://i.imgur.com/zzxHA.jpg) There's ample evidence that the area upstream of the creek is fairly well mineralized, minus any granite or black sands in the creek. This is good to know, just for reference.

WTF? I guess the good pet wood just doesn't roll out of the ground and into the creek until further downstream.

 Most obvious is alternating, and contains what are apparently triangular &amp; other polygonal inclusions that break the layered pattern. A few of these inclusions appear to be tinted dark green (Olivine?) but it's hard to tell because it is set in a black rock. The areas that are not covered with the layers have a mottled appearance, with black alternating with light off-white areas.

When inspected with a hand magnifier

My gut says this is a rock that has some sort of volcanic origin, and also some macro shots which are extreme close ups of various parts, showing the apparent gold, the layering up close, and a few of the angular inclusions.

#1 and #2 are strange agate examples. Is the white mineral chert? I've found dozens of agates around here

#3 is very difficult to take photos of, while I've remained stumped. I haven't seen anything around here before or since.

I think I may have found an iron meteorite. I posted in /r/askscience and received a variety of responses

I have since cut a slice off of the rock, but a faint crystalline pattern is still evident. (First time attempting any of this stuff so I'm sure my methods weren't as precise as they could have been.)

Before resigning to discouragement

I would greatly appreciate any help ID'ing this strange rock!

Thanks!

Dan here with what should be the start of a series of responses to things you have asked to see!  


On show today are two minerals I collected, but sometimes that HULK SMASH feeling is just so satisfying(especially if I have the sledge).  This rock I happened to break and the insides looked different/weird so I put it in the bucket and moved along to other rocks.  It was only later when we checked out the rocks in the fluorescent shed that I could see just how weirdly if fluoresced. The rock is a specimen of calcite, willemite, sphalerite, and possibly dolomite.  What makes it weird is that they are mixed together in some places causing weird quenching of the fluorescence and odd color mixtures in other places.  This rock looks best in [short wave ultraviolet light](http://imgur.com/a/pBRuN#0).  I took the pictures for this album using my macro lens for a DSLR and tel me tell you that it was not easy, especially free-handing it in the dark with slower exposures for the fluorescence, but I enjoyed it a lot regardless!  I took the same rock and shot more of it in [Mid wave UV light](http://imgur.com/a/uBnRi), in mid wave you can see the sphalerite fluorescing in blue/orange dots


The next rock is probably one of my most uniquely shaped self-finds, norbergite is yellow(yellow fluorescing), and the diopside you can't really see well but it's a very very light blue in daylight(bright blue fluorescing).  


There's a lot more that could be said about both of these rocks
