http://www.reddit.com/r/legal/comments/xv57f/we_made_an_album_and_someone_is_selling_it_on/

But we will take all the advice we can get.  Thank you.

We found his youtube
www.youtube.com/user/thenerfaholictwo

**EDIT:** So far you all have been a ***tremendous*** help, globally, and at some point we're going to call his parents about it so we don't have to get legal overseas about something like this.  Again, thanks so far everyone. :)

**EDIT 2:** So, but he still has other artist's music up as well, but ours looks like it's going to be taken down soon.  Thank you all!  I think we're going to try to contact his family still, just to make sure they know he's doing this kind of thing.

Once more

**EDIT 3:**  SUCCESS!! Raubana was able to contact the hosting company that was hosting his music and they took down the album from iTunes.  We get an error message in the US when we try to go to the page the album was on

I would love to hear more discussion from individuals who think they have good insight into the current scene.

CONTEXT: I have worked in the US electronic music industry for four years now, and corroboration with my coworkers and friends in the industry.

**EDIT:** I was not implying that producers today are making music at any loss of quality. In fact

**EDIT:** inb4 anyone assumes I mean pop dubstep when I say ""I believe the music has gotten better"". I mostly listen to UK bass, UK club, and experimental/acoustic crossover. Night Slugs, Triangle, Lucky Me, Warp, etc etc.

They had it mastered, just me agreeing that they had the rights to release my album under their label and that I wouldn't sue them- and gave me the release date. Feb 18th.

Today is February 18th. Today my first signed EP was released.

As of when I made this list, ""but I don't want my music organized by how many people listen to it, I want it catagorized with similar sounds.""  The point of this experiment was to turn people on to new subreddits they may not have known about.  Feel free to make/post your own mixes.  An example might be http://www.reddit.com/r/ska+reggae+dub (Mixing /r/dubstep+electronicmusic+sambass will not work, bigger subreddits drown out smaller ones)

Please repremand me for any typos and omissions.

My personal favorite discovery was /r/psybient.  That lead to creating this http://www.reddit.com/r/psybient+ambientmusic+chillmusic+psytrance and thus http://redditplayer.phoenixforgotten.com/?r=/psybient+ambientmusic+chillmusic+psytrance

Problems I've noticed so far:

* Genres are micro-categorized to the point that some genres must seriously only cover a single artist or two.

* Many of the members of the community are great.  Many more are hard to deal with.  For example, not DnB you tool,"" and, ""this DJ sucks why would you listen to his mixes,"" or, ""this is tech-step, what is it even doing here?""  For someone trying to get into the music

* New producers seem to pop up out of nowhere, there will only be a single track or two from that producer floating around, with seemingly nothing else available.  

* DJs are oftentimes intentionally vague about what they are playing.  This probably bothers me more than anything.  While DJs certainly deserve credit for staying on top of things and putting good mixes together, making the tunes in the first place.  I read an interview not too long ago where a fairly well-known Texas DJ was asked where he got his tracks.  His response was basically, ""I'm not telling you that, haha.""

I think a lot of EDM enthusiasts forget what it's like to be a newbie sometimes -- thinking,"" and then later finding yourself at Best Buy standing in front of a wall of poorly-designed trance album covers trying to figure out what the hell an ""Ibiza"" is or who actually made the music that you're listening to.

It's also part of the reason that I think Deadmau5 is so popular.  People hear a song of two of his that they like, we'd have more producers who are as famous as Deadmau5.  Instead, fans are supposed to hunt down singles and mixes that -- let's face it -- the average person doesn't have the time or the know-how to find.

So what think you, is there any way I can *stop* being confused?

1341364950.0,w0cdw,Techno vs. Electronic Music FAQ,intripletime,280,88,188,"I'm writing this as an informative

**""What is electronic music?""**

This term refers to any music that is at least predominantly created with electronic instruments, computer programs, etc. Electronic music isn't technically a ""genre"" of its own. You might instead call it a ""blanket term"", because it refers to a wide variety of genres across a gigantic spectrum of different styles.

**""Isn't that just techno?""**

No. Techno refers to a specific genre in the electronic music spectrum

**""But it all sounds the same. Can't we just call it techno?""**

To the untrained senses, let me give you a quick comparison, so you can see the variety in electronic:

[""Warmed By the Drift"" by Biosphere](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMPiFv1P79Q)

[""Waters of Nazareth"" by Justice](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsE9UYOk-k0) 

[""Sheltered Life"" by Erlend Oye](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_WxS8CDRY0&amp;feature=results_video&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PL4D6915DFF44075C3)

The three examples clearly have nothing to do with each other

**""But what's wrong with using techno as a blanket term?**""

The problem with this is that techno as a specific genre already exists. Suppose you referred to all electronic music as ""techno"". Okay

**""What about using the term electronica?""**

We try to avoid this term as well

**""Aren't you just being snobby/elitist/pedantic?""**

Think about it this way instead. Electronic music is incredibly diverse. It's some of the most creative stuff you'll ever hear. But it's also one of the most easily dismissed styles of music. When you call it ""all just techno shit""

**""Aren't we just splitting hairs?""**

Well, and probably try to educate them... right? And like rock music, electronic music is a huge spectrum of stuff. I don't think it's splitting hairs.

**""Where can I find out more about all this?""**

For an outdated, check out [Ishkur's Guide](http://techno.org/electronic-music-guide/). It'll at least give you a good start. From there, I'd suggest downloading Last.fm and listening to some electronic genres on it. Pandora is good, too. I don't recommend Spotify at this time simply because the Radio feature is rather primitive, but if nothing else, you can look on there. Hell, you could even PM me asking for recommendations. I'd be happy to give them.

**""I have a question not covered in here?""**

Post it in the comments and I'll address it.

1373895716.0,1ic75i,[GENRE MONDAYS] - This week: Minimal [Includes my plan for increasing discussion.],empw,222,34,82,"*As always

Hey all.

[Last week I asked you what you wanted to see in the subreddit to increase discussion.](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/1i0qf3/meta_looking_to_spur_more_discussion_and/) You came together on two ideas

So here's my tentative schedule:

* Every Monday we discuss a genre voted on by the community. [This week we'll start out with one I've chosen.] I want to focus on smaller genres that aren't usually posted or talked about here.

* Every Friday we'll have a New Music post that will prompt users to post artists with under 10, it's just what I came up with. Let me know.] 

**On to the discussion.**

##Minimal Techno 

Minimal Techno is defined by [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_techno) as a minimalist sub-genre of techno. It is characterized by a stripped-down aesthetic that exploits the use of repetition

Minimal techno first emerged in the early 1990s and the style is often associated with a second generation of Berlin and Rostock artists. According to Derrick May “while the first-wave artists were enjoying their early global success, Robert Hood, Jeff Mills, Carl Craig, Kenny Larkin, Mike Banks and Alan Oldham.* The work of several of these artists evolved to become focused on minimalism.
Robert Hood describes the situation in the early 1990s as one where techno had become too ""ravey"", but there was a 'jack' element in the [old] structure. People would complain that there's no funk, no feeling in techno anymore, and the easy escape is to put a vocalist and some piano on top to fill the emotional gap. I thought it was time for a return to the original underground.""

The minimal techno sound that emerged at this time has been defined by Robert Hood as: ""a basic stripped down, the art of making people move their butts, speaking to their heart, mind and soul. It's a heart-felt rhythmic techno sound."" Daniel Bell has commented that he had a dislike for minimalism in the artistic sense of the word, finding it too ""arty.""

In Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music (2004), minimal techno has its roots in the landmark works of pioneers such as Kraftwerk and Detroit Techno's Derrick May and Juan Atkins. Minimal techno focuses on ""rhythm and repetition instead of melody and linear progression"", much like classical minimalist music and the polyrhythmic African musical tradition that helped inspire it. By 1994, according to Sherburne, the term ""minimal"" was in use to describe ""any stripped-down, Acidic derivative of classic Detroit style.""

Los Angeles based writer Daniel Chamberlin, and Surgeon and that of American minimalist composer Steve Reich, in particular the pattern phasing system Reich employs in many of his works; the earliest being ""Come Out."" Chamberlin also sees the use of sine tone drones by minimalist composer La Monte Young and the repetitive patterns of Terry Riley's ""In C"" as other influences. Sherburne has suggested that the noted similarities between minimal forms of dance music and American minimalism could easily be accidental; he also notes that much of the music technology used in EDM has traditionally been designed to suit loop based compositional methods, which may explain why certain stylistic features of minimal techno sound similar to works of Reich's that employ loops and pattern phasing techniques.

[Spotify Playlist featuring a selection of Minimal tracks.](http://open.spotify.com/user/stiha85/playlist/7BJUvrmcII7qrqOIFBDADS)

**What I'd like to see happen:**

I'd like for this to be a little more than just people posting YouTube links. 

* I want to hear why you love or why you hate Minimal. 

* Who are your favorite labels?

* What got you into minimal

* What genres you like to mix with minimal

* If you can't get it

* Obviously

I hope this is a hit! Let's talk music friends!

http://silversable.bandcamp.com/ (deleted now)

Here are his general youtube accounts

http://www.youtube.com/user/thenerfaholic

http://www.youtube.com/user/silversablemusic

Listening through any collection of tracks on here will tip you off to the fact that he didn't produce any of this.  You may either recognize a song by an artist you know

I want to bring this to everybody's attention not only because he's illegally selling music other people made

If you recognize any of the songs he's selling

Thank you.

**EDIT:** In case you need more proof,"" (this was the original account we had problems with, both of these accounts are owned by Jack Eastment), and these were uploaded pretty recently:

http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/good-time-single/id550469427

http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/wide-awake-single/id549698018

These are tracks by my friend Raubana:

http://raubana.bandcamp.com/track/rebelions-harmony

http://raubana.bandcamp.com/track/elf-gear-hop

We need to find out who is hosting his music on iTunes and get him blacklisted

**EDIT 2:**

**He just made another bandcamp after deleting this last one.  STAY ON HIM.**

1324506778.0,nlt9n,RJD2s top ten ways not to eat shit on tour,istartriots,184,43,45,"1. Do NOT hire a tour manager. This one comes with a big caveat. Only do this if you have your shit together, you can totally do this yourself. It's really not rocket science. If you are the kind of person that likes being on time, as well as the expense of an extra person. I have done this for many tours

2. Hire a tour manager, or c. generally don't like being responsible for yourself. While I say this last part with some modicum of sarcasm, really, you'd be surprised. Some people just aren't built like that. I have met a lot of musicians who would rather have a bad guy to take the blame than to be responsible for their own fuck-ups.

3. Buy a vehicle to tour in. This may seem elementary, you have a head start on that fruit basket delivery service you've had your eye on.

4. Make merch people actually want. Posters are great, and restock as needed. T-shirts are second best in terms of something people always want. It's tempting to go for some cutesy mercy thing that nobody else has, but a lot of them are duds. So unless you're determined to roll out smorgasbord style, stick to the stuff that actually works. One item does not fit all. I know some artists who still can kill on CDs. I can't. C'est La Vie.

5. If at all possible, the kind of folks with interesting shit to talk about other than music. I guar-an-fucking-tee that you are not going to want to debate which Zep' album is definitively their best by day 13 or day 26. East coast scrabble champ 2007-2009? Sign me up. Opinionated annoying music encyclopedia? 'Scuse me while I fucking choke myself to death. While this won't always affect your bottom line, successful touring is best thought of as buying a timeshare; it pays off incrementally over many years. One three-week stint with a complete dickface can sour you to the whole idea.

6. Get yourself a good booking agent. This is frankly easier said than done, and yield you considerable sums. I often talk to artists who can't find an agency to take them on, thus, I know this can be hard to source. Nevertheless, get in where you fit in. For what they do the commission is without a doubt worth it.

7. Pretend you joined the army. This may sound like a joke, and b. eat well. You know how they say that in the military, they tell you not to touch your face for sanitary reasons? It's true. If you love picking bogs, you better stop now, cause you are entering ground fucking zero for germs and shit. For food stock up on rations. Peanut butter, dried fruits and nuts, soymilk and cereal-- all your friends

8. Know what a properly functioning show looks like. Don't know? Watch. I have been telling myself this for years, and if I didn't step in and make things happen (backline, soundcheck, set times, etc), no one would have picked up the pieces on my behalf. Most nights, it's clear what roles people play. Other times, again

9. Sell your own merch. I guarantee this will double or triple your sales. It just does.

10. Don't be an asswipe. I've gotten gigs from promoters, etc, just from them saying ""Oh, we had him last year and he wasn't difficult at all, not like artist X was, jesus that guy sucked"". You can be supremely talented and popular and people will put up with your shit to book you. You will also be the 3%, sooner or later they become one of the rest of us 97%ers. And when that happens, just pretend that you're the same guy that was stacking boxes 5 years ago for $9/hr,,False

Link to mixmag article: 
http://www.mixmag.net/words/news/avicii-responds-to-ultra-controversy

Quote:
&gt;﻿Avicii has responded to the ""controversy"" around his Ultra set during which he premiered new material from his upcoming album.
&gt;
&gt;He's faced a lot of criticism from fans who believe it shows a departure from his electronic style and that it sounds too 'country' influenced.
&gt;
&gt;In a Facebook post
&gt;
&gt;""I really wanted to switch things up and do something fun and different...this album is about experimentation and about showing the endless possibilities of house and electronic music.
&gt;
&gt;""It's about how to incorporate acoustic instruments from different styles and influences you wouldnt expect and still stay true to your own sound and musicality which for me has always been about the melodies and positive energy.
&gt;

My full set wasn’t being streamed, as I always strive for, and this album is about experimentation and about showing the endless possibilities of house and electronic music… But my album is certainly not “country”, and people have gotten hung up on an instrument we used for the live cover of a song. Every song on the album is a fusion with house and electronic music.”


So yeah - essentially I say fair dues to the guy - and I hope that it sparks a few of his fans into looking into some of the more experimental stuff (if only so they can type 'controversial Miami set' into Google and find the 'All Bases Covered' Shadow mix which is superb). But it really is a shame that so many people are so narrow-minded about it all.
