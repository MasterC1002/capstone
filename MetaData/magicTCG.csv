1375211248.0,1jd8o3,ESPN employee wants to ask: Would You Want to See M:tG on ESPN again?,chikago12,3755,1594,465,"The last time M:tG was on ESPN

1. The technology wasn't there, and couldn't make them out in the video.  I even knew the rules-imagine someone who doesn't.

2. This was on ESPN2, and streaming basically goes hand in hand with that.  Also, if you're watching a game on a stream, all you need is to hear the name of the card and you can gatherer it, and you have something to do in during the downtime in between rounds/shuffling.  

M:tG is more popular now than ever before.  The barrier to entry to M:tG is probably equal to that of poker

I think it'd be really interesting to see M:tG on ESPN again, I think ESPN can really push the technology such that pro M:tG becomes even more popular and watchable (like being able to hover your mouse over the card and have the oracle text pop up in real time).  


Full Disclosure: I'm a Production Assistant for ESPN

Thanks for your time and responses.  

EDIT 1: Woah did not expect this kind of response.  I'll do my best to find out what kind of #'s Watch ESPN gets, it'd have to be better than the one WOTC or SCG already produces.  I'll also let tehm know that M:tGer's are willing to watch ads if they are being provided with a free stream, and that there's a group among those who willing to pay so that they don't have to watch ads.  I don't think this pitch is going to be for a little while (I just started about two weeks ago) but I'm excited to have so many different voices and ideas available here.  Thanks guys.

1370549155.0,1ftasn,The elitism shown in this subreddit damages the entire game.,YamiSilaas,2397,1178,629,"Earlier today on another thread a guy mentioned that he had a good game of magic while playing his bant hexproof deck and was met with a torrent of downvotes and people throwing passive-agressive insults at him for  playing a ""non-interactive"" deck. Something along the lines of ""That deck is so interactive that it can't have good games."".

Even when a fellow player defended him saying ""People have fun doing different things. I hate it when people invalidate ""non-interactive"" magic. It's a part of the game and it is perfectly ok for him to have fun with Bant Hexproof."" he was met with further attacks and downvoting.

When asked to justify their attacks the response was ""Bant hexproof being non interactive and bad magic is a common agreement."" Which translates to ""Attacking people is okay as long as you're agreeing with the circle-jerk."". This is the worst thing that can happen to a community. The circle-jerk keeps the entire community stupid and stagnant with no potential for growth. r/leagueoflegends figured this out barely a year into its existence and has fought to keep the circle-jerking at a minimum ever since. 

I was also then told to ""grow up"" for defending my fellow player. Classy.

Frankly

I'll end this with a message to my fellow spikes: Competition is good but keep it on the board. Don't bring your superiority complex to the discussion board. Bringing your salt and negativity to everyday conversation WILL harm this community. There's a reason so many people think magic players are arrogant pricks.

Edit: To those who have read the thread and called me out on losing my cool, it's the overall arrogance and animosity i see towards those who don't agree with the circle jerk. His comment was just the straw that broke the camels back for me. Thank you for reading.

Edit 2: Just look at this comment section. There's so many people trying to add to the conversations only to receive a ton of downvotes. **THE DOWNVOTE BUTTON IS NOT YOUR PERSONAL ""I DISAGREEE"" BUTTON. IT IS THERE TO GET RID OF FLUFF SO THAT THOSE WITH REAL COMMENTARY CANT HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD.**

Edit 3: Someone pointed out that my example isn't a very good representative of the point i was trying to make so instead i'll reference something that happened a few weeks ago where someone said they felt Vexing Devil was a strong card in standard and was met with a ton of negativity and downvoting until he explained that it synergizes extremely well with Varolz and Morbid.

Fast forward 20 years and I have a 7 year old daughter.  We were in at our local game shop/book store [Chat Noir Books in New Liskeard](http://chatnoirbooks.com/) and my daughter sees some of the Magic cards/decks and asks about them.  The store owner hears me explaining it to her and gives us a couple ""intro packs"".  Sorry I don't know exactly what they were

So over the past 6 months or so she has saved up a bit of her allowance and purchased a couple booster packs and even a play mat.  I had heard there was going to be a release party/tournament at Chat Noir and talked to Paul one of the owners about it.  He said that this wasn't the kind of thing that my daughter would enjoy but just to wait and that he would be having an event soon that she would like.  Well that event came last night.

He broke the people there into two groups.  The ""competitive"" players were in the back and he brought us newbies with a couple experienced players out to the front.  He got us both registered with DCI numbers and explained how the booster draft system worked.  We then went through a booster draft with the 6 of us that were up front.  Then they helped us sort through the mess of cards we had picked to get a deck built.  When they were talking to my daughter about her deck and maybe taking a certain colour of creatures out they didn't even laugh at her when she said ""No

Then the games started.  She played against me first

After the ""regular"" games were done they showed us how mini masters worked and we managed to get in a couple games of that which was really enjoyable.  

My daughter while building her deck had said that she really like the Merfolk as well as the Angels and I had said that I was enjoying the Vampires.  All the while the mini masters were being played and afterwards people were coming up to us and giving us cards.  ""I know you like Merfolk and I am not going to use this guy, a roll of the dice and then pick a foil card off of that page in a binder full of cards.  Our collection of Magic cards went up by a factor of 5 just last night.  I had to buy a box just to get all the cards home.

We couldn't have had a better time.  I understand that it is hard to have to play against a child in a game like this

Now I just have to start reading on exactly how to build a reasonable deck.  :)

Without further ado...

**The Real 50 Rules of Magic**

-----------------------------------------

1. Magic is actually about fifteen different games. Some of them don't even have names.

2. You can lose before the game starts.

3. Your wallet can be part of the game.

4. The game can be played with the cards still in the binder.

5. The cards don't always do what they say.

6. Your intuition about how good a card is will probably be wrong.

7. All the rules have exceptions.

8. Some basic lands cost more money than most mythics.

9. The best deck in the format can be the worst.

10. The worst color in the format can be the best.

11. Just because it's an instant doesn't mean you *have* to use it on their turn.

12. Being at low life doesn't mean you're losing. Winning at 1 life

13. Having more permanents on the board doesn't mean you're winning.

14. Playing with lands in your deck is optional in several formats. (Technically

15. Regression to the mean should not surprise you.

16. Don't be results oriented.

17. Trust your intuition

18. Constructed decks are 75 cards.

19. Starting with 7 is a privilege

20. MTGO is not equal to paper Magic. DotP is not equal to anything.

21. Just because something can't be countered doesn't mean it is uncounterable.

22. You can target things that can't be targeted *if they're on the stack*. Funny that.

23. You don't know how the game works. Don't worry

24. Your opponent doesn't have your best interests in mind.

25. You will leak information. Try not to leak so much.

26. If you get flustered and put that land from the top of your deck right into play with a frustrated sigh

27. Unless you're playing me

28. When you scoop your cards

29. Creatures are optional.

30. EDH is a friendly casual format where Mana Drain

31. No one calls it ""Commander"".

32. Magic players will overuse their slang because they love to durdle like misers until they get too salty from their opponent hitting the stone blade cold nuts. Then they actively want to kill themselves.

33. The less you respect your opponent

34. Just because he's 300 lbs and breathes through his mouth doesn't mean his cards won't kill you.

35. Yes Virginia

36. Offering a handshake can be considered a hostile action.

37. Magic players are such outstanding citizens that the comprehensive floor rules have an explicit penalty for stealing the table markers.

38. Yes, there are people who love cardboard more than you do. People have been killed (literally) for their collections.

39. Some people pin their entire self-worth on the performance of their rogue deck. Exploit that.

40. If your opponent tells you you played terribly

41. The card you think won you the game is not the card that won you the game.

42. Magic is the meaning to life

43. The aggro-midrange-control framework is a simplistic guideline that is often wrong about how matchups will play out.

44. Testing 10 games is not representative.

45. Testing 10 games can still be enough to understand a matchup.

46. Two different players can pilot the same deck very differently.

47. Different formats and matchups have different levels of variance.

48. Most people use the terms variance, and skill loosely and incorrectly.

49. Don't play a bad version of something else.

50. Read. The. Freaking. Card. Except see rule 5.

It was supposed to be a game shop but without any customers it's was just a room. Each day I'd sort magic the gathering cards

I was excited that I got a new job but slowly my hours were diminishing each day. 

I couldn't decide which phrase should be our store slogan: 

""Wanna close early?"" or ""Well

On April 18th

They said it should be alright as long as I presented it the right way.

April 19th was when everything changed. Eighteen people passed through our shop in one day

During the draft of April 20th

When a newbie store holds it's first sanctioned draft
what do the people of Reddit do?

They pay for another draft afterwords and we do it right.

If you had to go and couldn't stay for the second draft

You know what people did after people walked through the door? They walked through the door too.

No joke

It was the moment that made us believe everything was possible.

We were open til 4 a.m. laughing

Reddit, and telling your friends about us.

It was also dark, the highways weren't lit, and I was just excited about picking up the collection and not paying attention to where we going. After sorting through the collection I was going to add the cards to my book, and noticed I couldn't find my bag.

You should now be able to set your user flair.  Big thanks to TheCid, and I'm proud to be able to fly my favored guild colors and insignia.

This is a good place for anyone who has questions/suggestions/comments on flair to post them.  We'll respond throughout the day.

We saw how quickly the discussion about our relationship with Wizards exploded, dislike the specter of censorship as much as anyone else.  Here's what we want you to know.  

-**We always have and always will remove content that we find hateful

-If you need a place to leak illicit and/or unofficial spoilers, or report on them, do it right away because we all want to read them. But read the official spoiler thread first, because nobody likes reposts.

-If WotC approaches us about content that needs to be taken down, and we're working with them on some other cool surprises for you down the road.  We'd hate to lose our friendly relationship with WotC over anything less than a critical existential issue, so we might remove some content if we're asked to do so **and** if we agree that the content is illegal, unethical, offensive, or otherwise reasonable to remove.

-**We're here for a reason

-------

**Phew!**  That was a lot.

Any questions?  We'll be around.  If you just want to comment to show off your flair and/or declare war on rival guilds

Hey guys

The mentality behind it is that it is spoiler season, it's meant to generate traffic, and while it's nice to have the easiest access possible to the spoiler in picture form all the time (And sometimes in the main thread it ends up like that anyway for a few cards here and there,) it can tend to take away from some of the publicity that should be generated to the website itself when we put things into an imgur album and just click away.  

This may be an unpopular idea but my suggestion was to wait ~12 hours after the spoilers are released before linking to a spoiler album in pure picture form,"" but we'd love the community's input as well, while keeping what I previously stated in mind.   

***Edit: While we can somewhat gauge the community's reaction by up and down votes,"" or downvoting and writing, ""That's the dumbest shit I've ever heard,"" is much more valuable than pressing a or z on the post.***

1367123240.0,1d98rf,Do the Newbies a favor--don't cheat.,rt_tlp,817,132,441,"So I attended my first prerelease today. My best friend came along

So

The entire day, I figured out why she didn't think it was great; she didn't know how double strike worked. She thought that ""double strike"" only applied to the first turn it was summoned (she said she needed a way to put Haste on it to make it useful, which is what tipped me off to her maybe not understanding it) and she would apply normal damage for it each time. There was one instance where it was powered up to 10, and it got a hit directly on the opponent. The opponent took 10 and asked her if her turn was over. On multiple occasions (obviously not when the hydra was at 10), it would hit, the player would assign some kind-of-strong blocker, and would ""kill"" the hydra (by ignoring double strike).

When I found out a few hours after the prerelease, after 4 losses, 1 win, did the opponent deal the right amount of damage from the hydra. She asked why, he told her, and played correctly for the rest of the game, but figured it was too late to tell the judge or anything since the night was over (probably true).

The point is, but after hearing this, the fact that 5 people lied to this new player's face just because they knew they could get away with it? 

I can't even say ""well it was clearly just one bad egg

I don't know what the point of this post is. Part of it is just expressing how completely appalled I am by this skeezy behavior. Maybe I feel like you guys need to know this kind of behavior exists

It's one thing to not remind an opponent of triggers

Hey /r/magictcg

twotwobearz here. This post isn't anywhere near as exciting as a new Magic set, I'll wait.

OK

As most of you remember, retired from compiling spoilers after Gatecrash. Due to the immense amount of work it took to keep a spoiler updated for three straight weeks, Jester took a well-deserved slumber.

To avoid the problem of any one person being burnt out in the future, /u/Acaviae, /u/Amarkov, /u/Wafflecopter42, and /u/RumZ512.

The point of this post is very simple: these guys deserve a huge amount of thanks for all their work. I know they didn't volunteer for this job for the praise (or the non-existent karma)

Moving forward, we do plan on switching over to a shared account for posting spoilers, so that it's easier for the Spoiler Team to edit and update the daily post as new cards are revealed. (Thanks to the several other redditors who suggested this great idea.)

At the end of the day, a place to compile information. For us, it's a service and a labor of love. We're not always perfect, but we try, and we're definitely open to suggestions.

1366958505.0,1d51ut,"Forget Timmy, Johnny and Spike... this weekend I want to encourage you all to be a ""Max""",Hibernian,798,187,http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1d51ut/forget_timmy_johnny_and_spike_this_weekend_i_want/

I went for a final GTC draft last weekend before the release of Dragon's Maze and in the final round I faced off against Max. He was playing a Dimir deck that made good use of evasion to punch through damage. I was playing a super consistent Boros deck with triple Wojek Halberdiers and a Boros Reckoner. The winner of the match would get a prize and the loser would not. 

We were both at low health when I swung with everything, completely missed that the Halberdiers first strike damage would go off before lifelink, meaning I would kill him as a state based effect between first strike and normal combat damage. 

**Max did not miss this.**

But he didn't try to hide it either. As we're both looking at the board

**So who is Max?**

Max is a guy who did not get angry about his mistake. He did not try to take advantage of my oversight of first strike damage. He was a good sportsman and he played by the rules

So remember this weekend that YES, people will keep coming back. If you are a jerk, people will find other places to play or quit all together. 

Enjoy the prerelease. Play to win. But be kind


**EDIT**
Lots of responses to this so I want to touch on a few points:

* Yes, rather than *WHY* you are there in the first place. The title wasn't meant to be semantically correct, but to use a creative parallel to make you think about your actions. 
* Yes
* There seems to be a misconception that Max = not playing to win. That is false. Max adheres to the rules. Max isn't a jerk to others. Max is polite and friendly
* Likewise
* Remember that you are part of a Magic ecosystem. Prerelease events are like breeding season. If you poison the water when all the newborns are figuring out how to stand

**This is a self post.** Your upvotes are powerless to give me karma (but they still let everyone else read this thread so you should give them pls).

Most of you know the drill, because apparently when I decide not to be we get two Mythic Rares spoiled then.

---------

**Why we do this:** there's no reason to have 15 threads with the same subject matter on a subreddit, and sometimes it dilutes a big piece of news itself because there's 15 threads about the same subject with 10 upvotes, instead of 1 with 150 upvotes. This consolidation is both good for us that have too much time on our hands at home, and you guys who want to be able to click near the top of /r/magicTCG and find what you're looking for as well.

This year

Some Good Games stores are Core

The WMCQ was held on Saturday, particularly late at night after a WMCQ Top 8. For reference, [a man was shot in broad daylight on the morning of the event](http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/man-in-serious-condition-after-shooting-20130601-2niye.html) less than 5 minutes away from the venue. Concerns about the distance of the venue from the physical location of the host and the Sydney CBD were raised a month before the event, but not addressed by the TO.

Other than that

The fact that several hundred people qualified for the WMCQ

Today, but the venue for the second day of a double-header weekend was not the same as for the previous day. The venue chosen was Good Games Hurstville, [a good 15 kilometres away from Good Games Central](http://goo.gl/maps/AOFei), let alone at ***an entirely different store***, and one that was not Advanced level at the time applications for the events opened (and thus should never have had the chance to be anywhere near running a PTQ). A month before the weekend, venues closer to the city and closer to the actual host of the event still had 200-300 capacity rooms available for full-weekend hire - the only limiting factor being the higher costs that Good Games Central was unwilling to pay.

The total attendance for the PTQ was 144. The play-space at Good Games Hurstville could apparently sit ""100"". You can immediately see the problem. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/LGnMuL9.jpg) is a picture of the degree to which the players were compacted into space. Instead of the standard two games per table

**[The space issue was so bad that players were playing in the café next door](http://i.imgur.com/y3AKjVd.jpg).** Everyone in that image was a player or spectator at the tournament. The solution that the TO thought was appropriate for the issue with not being able to spare one of the Judges into the separate building was ***TO POST A SIGN IN THE CAFÉ WINDOW WITH A JUDGE'S PHONE NUMBER. Yes***, they would have not had that problem.

As far as anecdotal accounts go

The reason I'm posting this is that Good Games as an entity has completely ceased any kind of communication with the upset player-base, and under-attended as a result, event that Good Games ran today, so that Good Games is unable to avoid consequence for how badly they treated competitive Magic in Sydney, their own Judge staff and all the players at their events.

Short Story:  We've rescinded all price increases on our pre-ordered Modern Masters, felt that our course of action was not the correct one at the time.

Long Story:

The situation was this:  we realized a little too late that we'd vastly under-priced our stock of Modern Masters, as, in a sense, we felt they had ""first dibs"".

In this

Not only was it wrong, demanding a ransom.  That wasn't our intention, but to be honest, we approached the entire situation from the wrong angle.  We looked at it as Businessmen, but, as you may have heard, We Are Gamers.

Over the weekend we discussed our options internally, we can't provide their product to anyone, and we wouldn't really be that great of a gaming store regardless of other circumstances if that were the case. 

Wizards confirmed today that we had violated none of their guidelines

So we discussed it a bit more

We contacted the customers we previously sent the emails to detailing the price increase and alerted them that this would not, their orders would be honored as they were made, as they should have been from the beginning.  Our panic over the limited stock had blinded us to the fact that they too, are Gamers.  

Again, we admit we initially handled the situation extremely poorly, and hope you enjoy your boxes when they arrive next week!

This has certainly been a learning experience for us, we're making the following changes:

1.  We will not sell conservative print run items on our website.  As a small store

2.  We will be far more diligent when it comes to our online sales.  We freely admit this is an issue that should have been noticed and dealt with months ago, not months later.

3.  We will continue to view our customers as Gamers, remember that We Are Gamers.  An extension of the golden rule, treat other Gamers as we would also like to be treated.

4.  We will update our online sales policy

5.  We will continue to extend our outreach among distributors

We would like to apologize to the community as a whole as well, how we wanted to proceed.  We hope that you agree that in the end, we made the right decision.

So now the warning part. I just got an email from them saying the price was 289.99 a box and that if I wanted my order shipped I would need to pay the difference. This is more than what my local game stores charged but I didn't order from them because I thought I had plenty coming. But they didn't charge enough so now they want to go back 2 months on a preorder and charge me the difference. I feel this is a TERRIBLE business practice and I urge all of you to know what kind of outfit they are.

We've been in discussion with a WotC representative regarding the use of their symbols and icons on this subreddit. We're very close to getting everything set up

However

This means that the subreddit is going to officially enforce certain rules beyond that which reddit requires us to enforce (""no personal information""

The two main points are as follows:

* Wizards of the Coast forbids unofficial spoilers. 

While we are not required to forbid links to external sites with unofficial spoilers

Again

We ARE allowed to ""report"" on unofficial spoilers. This means that we can in fact copy spoiler text into reddit comments.

* Wizards of the Coast straight-up forbids certain kinds of content. I'm just going to paste straight out of their legalese:

&gt; However, discrimination or illegal activities, or makes disparaging, libelous or dishonest statements about Wizards and/or its products, employees and agents.

Some of you are probably thinking that certain other subreddits violate this policy - don't worry about that. The ""Fan Site"" is r/magictcg

In keeping with reddit's longstanding tradition of free speech

As a result of this, that's why.

----

TL;DR: 

* Don't leak cards on r/magictcg
* Don't promote porn, or illegal activity
* Don't commit libel against WotC and their products/employees/agents

--- 

BONUS:

We'll be looking for a new header image soon, we'll set the parameters and let people submit proposed images to us.

UPDATE:

I was reading things in an overly strict manner when I set the initial spoiler policy. Please read the revised text.

SECOND UPDATE:

This is not an irreversible decision, and all we're doing is saying that we won't let that start.

We are not going to be removing legitimate criticism of Wizards, or events. If something like that happens, reddit's longstanding tradition of free speech will win out.

This decision does not make us an ""official"" Wizards site. We're still unaffiliated with Wizards - they just grant fan sites the ability to use their intellectual property with some restrictions.(One of them

&gt;So here’s what happened. Originally, had already taken up the tenth slot. (Planeswalkers for complexity and specialness reasons need to be mythic rare.) 

&gt;We talked about Ral just being the Izzet representative but decided that for numerous purposes (Commander being one of the biggest) we wanted a blue/red legendary creature and thus an Izzet maze runner. 

&gt;It was decided well into development that the maze runners should all be the same rarity which meant they had to be rare as mythic rare wasn’t possible. This resulted in us making some changes to turn the mythic rare maze runners into rare maze runners. 

&gt;**One of those swaps was Voice of Resurgence with Emmara. As many have guessed

**Why I do this:** /r/magictcg is a great subreddit, and it is enraging for people to talk about a card and have no way of reading what it does. So if one more person asks why I don't just link to one of those sites, I will publicly shame them.

So, do these things:

1. Fix your manabase. Get the whatever Innistrad taplands, you NEED 4 Blood Crypts and 4 Dragonskull Summit. No, those Rakdos Guildgates are not good enough, nor are those Evolving Wilds. If you want to be a serious Standard player, first thing you need to do, every time a new set comes out, is get playsets of the lands. 

2. Cut to 60 cards. Not 65, and in your opening hand, run four (general example: Rancor). If you want to see it every single game, run three (general example: Liliana of the Veil). If you need it once in a while, situationally, run two (general example: Ultimate Price). If it's something with a very narrow focus, or isn't always usable, run one (general example: Niv Mizzet

3. Do your research. Go here, those decks are winning tournaments and you are not. Clearly, their ideas are better than yours when it comes to competitive decks, so if they're running four Strangleroot Geists and you're running Worldspine Wurm, just assume they do, in fact, know better. At the very least, and keep an open mind - you want to improve! 

4. When someone suggests you get a certain card(s), you should know what you need, and always be trying to trade for that stuff. If you have to, make some substitutions for the time being, but remember that they're temporary, not permanent, substitutions.

5. Resist the urge to buy packs. Once you start getting in the top 4 of your local tournaments, buy singles. Also, you can go on eBay and buy playsets of every common and uncommon in a set for $30-$40. That's well worth it to not have to worry about whether or not you have four Blood Artists the day you're putting your deck together. When a new set drops, yeah, grab a box, and buy a commons+uncommons playset. Then use the stuff from the box to trade for rares you need. But after that first box, just buy the singles. I know, but let's say you've got $25 to spend. That'll get you six or seven packs of RTR. Maybe you pull something awesome - but probably not. Right now, no less). What's going to make you happier, or two foil resto angels

Please

Then

tl;dr: Want help winning? Stop durdling around and fix yourself first!

1358711081.0,16xz9o,"Vintage, A primer",WolfPacLeader,546,69,http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/16xz9o/vintage_a_primer/

Ok, the most fun.  Another misconception about Vintage is that whoever goes first wins.  While being on the play is possibly more important in vintage than any other format, it is very possible to win on the draw.  Turn 1 wins happen, but they are NOT the norm.  Yes, vintage players have access to all of the most broken combos ever printed in MTG, but they also have access to the best hate cards ever printed, so it balances out somewhat.

Vintage decks:

When talking about vintage,” and are named after cards which are integral to the strategies of these decks.  

The five pillars are:

1.	Mana drain
2.	Mishra’s Workshop
3.	Bazaar of Baghdad
4.	Dark Ritual
5.	Null Rod

Decks in the Mana Drain pillar are control decks, or Tinker/Blightsteel Colossus.  These decks are basically the control deck that you always wish you had.  They can kill very fast, do a great job of shutting down opponents, and are hard to hate out.  Mirror matchups between decks in this pillar can be very long drawn out games, although sometimes those games can be fairly quick.

There are plenty of decks which fit into this archtype and are quite varied:

Jace Control: http://www.mtgpulse.com/event/11919#166557

Oath: http://www.mtgpulse.com/event/11919#166554

Bomberman: http://www.mtgpulse.com/event/11919#166555

Gush Storm: http://www.mtgpulse.com/event/11224#155927

Note

Decks in the next two pillars probably have the least variety in them.  Mishra’s Workshop based decks almost always are controlling decks whose goal is to prevent their opponent from every casting anything.  They do this by abusing lands which add more than 1 mana to their mana pool, these decks also run Wastelands in order to kill any nonbasics that their opponents play.  These decks run some win conditions such as Lodestone Golem or Karn, Silver Golem, but the bread and butter of this deck are spheres, named after Sphere of Resistance, and also including Thorn of Amethyst, Lodestone Golem, such as Chalice of the Void

MUD list: http://www.mtgpulse.com/event/11224#155924

Decks in the Bazaar of Baghdad pillar, dredge decks will normally win on turn 2 or 3, and this is probably where a lot of the misconception about vintage comes from.  The deck works by getting a ton of cards into the graveyard with Bazaar of Baghdad and dredgers such as Golgari Grave Troll and Stinkweed Imp, and then, after removing their opponents hand with the flashback of Cabal therapy, reanimate a big threat such as Sun Titan or Flame-kin zealot and swing with 20 zombies made from Bridge from Below and sacking Narcomoebas and Bloodghasts to Cabal Therapy and Dread Returns flashback costs.  In addition to the combo dredge deck I just described, there are decks which do not run Dread Return and instead focus on beating down with Ichorid’s and zombie tokens.  Normally decks run a combination of both.

Dredge decklist:  http://www.mtgpulse.com/event/11919#166552

Decks in the Dark Ritual pillar are almost always storm decks of some kind.  The decks play fairly similar to storm decks in other formats

TPS decklist: http://www.mtgpulse.com/event/11903#166450

Decks in the Null Rod pillar are decks that everyone should be familiar with, Stony Silence.  These decks are basically creature based aggro, except almost all of their creatures are disruptive, such as Gaddock Teeg, Qasali Pridemage, Meddling Mage, or Trygon Predator, fish and hatebears.  The only real difference is that fish runs blue for counterspells

Fish decklist:  http://www.mtgpulse.com/event/11918#166543

Hatebears decklist: http://www.mtgpulse.com/event/11330#157547

Hopefully this has helped give those of you who needed it a bit of understanding about MTG's most powerful format.  If you have any questions please feel free to ask.

Edit:  I didn't mention this in my post

&gt; the advantage of vintage is that pretty much every vintage tournament will allow some number of proxies

(http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/yzm41/for_every_50_upvotes_this_post_gets_rfg_will_be/)

It was a post where a store promised to give away a pack of round cornered sleeves for every 50 upvotes the post got. It is currently still number five on the ""top rated of all time"" for this subreddit and sat in the number one place for quite a while. People from /r/all were showing up confused because it hit the front page. 

There are rules of Reddit that all subreddits are bound to. (http://www.reddit.com/rules) and one of them is:

&gt;""Don't ask for votes or engage in vote manipulation.""

One of the examples is:

&gt; NOT OK: Creating submissions such as ""For every upvote I will ..."" or ""... please upvote this!""

So I was pretty dissappointed when I woke up today to see this post on the number one spot of the front page:

&gt; [Hiya MagicTCG. You guys make up a pretty awesome community and I would like to giveaway some gold.](http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1c9kxa/hiya_magictcg_you_guys_make_up_a_pretty_awesome/)

Here are some segments from the body of the post:

&gt; This post must get at least 15 upvotes for me to giveaway prizes! I don't get Karma. I jus want others to see this.
15=1 prize
30= 2
50= 3

Here's another one:

&gt; Sometime tonight (EST) I will use my handy dandy MTG app to get a random card from gatherer. Whoever has that card gets the gold. If no one has that card I'll keep going until I find one. I'll do this up to three times **depending on how much attention this post gets.**

This is clear solicitation of votes for prizes. You may be asking why it's a problem, let me explain why this is a bad practice to allow.

Let's say this guy promised to give away Reddit gold, you now have a cookie on your browser, and for the next month or so every time you buy something there he gets a cut. The mods would surely remove this, but not before hundreds (or even thousands) of users followed the link, keep in mind this costs the OP **literally nothing** to do, and guarantees at least a few hundred suckers follow the referral link.

**This allows people to monetize this subreddit at no risk to themselves**.

Please mods, your job is to remove it. 


**UPDATE**: Looks like the post has now been removed in under a half an hour of this post going up. Thank you mods. I know it's hard to delete a post that has gotten a large number of comments

Hey all - for those of you who don't know me

Playing competitive Magic also led me to my current ""real job"" as a game designer.  In the past I've worked on VS System, Chaotic, and other games.  Currently, I'm part of the team that makes the Ascension deckbuilding game, and recently announced our new project - SolForge - which you can learn more about (and contribute to the creation of) here:  http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1965800643/solforge-digital-trading-card-game

I'm happy to answer questions about any of these things or whatever else you might be interested in.  I'm going to take questions until about noon PST tomorrow (Friday August 3rd)

So ask away!

*Tipping for signing will make us love you.* As for how much to tip... it depends. A buck or two is good. A $5 bill is wonderful. More and you're just telling us how much you love our art and want to support us. I had a guy get 150~ cards signed and tipped $10. The guy behind him had four cards but was feeling generous and tipped $20. So it varies a lot. But just know that we really

*If you're getting stuff signed

*Afternoons are slow.* If you want to chat with us

*Don't be shy!* Don't hesitate to come over and hang out. We don't bite. Unless you're into that.

*Please keep drinks off of our table.* Please, but it terrifies me when your drink is precariously looming over all of my cards and mats. And it's very hard to sell a stained playmat.

I'd like to talk to you a bit about that.,uberwolf0,588,130,448,"In the past 6 years I have helped T.O. at 3 different stores.  We often ran magic events two days a week, and try to still make a small profit.

The closing of these 3 stores all have their different reasons.  The first one closed in part due to the death of one of the partners.  The second due to health reasons of the owner.  The third due to mismanagement and labor issues.  These are the overall final straws that broke the backs of these stores

The underlying factor to all 3 of these stores closing is pretty simple;  People don't spend very much money locally.  Its true

Magic is an expensive game.  We all know that.  We need to save a buck or two when we can.  Getting our boxes online for 10 or 20 dollars cheaper makes sense.  Getting our singles online because they're cheaper from Ebay adds up.

But that extra 10% markup

Hell, lets not go wishing for the impossible here ;)

What I'm trying to say is this;  If you have a local gaming store

I know this is old hat.  I know what you're thinking... ""Three stores in six years?  You must be a shitty T.O."" and ya know what?  you might be right.  

But if you're thinking ""It won't happen to my LGS"".  Think again.  When we closed this last friday and we announced it to the room full of 25 FNM'ers the look on their face was unanimous.  It was shock.  no one saw it coming.  I bet you won't see it coming until you see the doors close on your LGS either.

Wrong, the next thing we see/hear are people yelling in the main room, so naturally we go into check, people are literally bidding on the judge promos from the vault, I thought that was BS so I got a re-fund and left.

Brethren and sistren, the DCI said:

&gt; In Sealed Deck tournaments, if any). **Players who drop from the tournament before fulfilling this duty will receive a match loss in the first round.** Tournament officials then collect the recorded card pools and redistribute them randomly. A player may randomly receive the product he or she registered. The Head Judge should require players to sort the cards they register according to some criteria (e.g. by color and then alphabetically) to assist the player receiving the pool.

Notice that line in bold: if you drop before swapping

You do *not* get disqualified for theft.

You do *not* get your cards confiscated.

You do *not* get the police called on you.

You do *not* get banned by the DCI.

You just... go on your merry way with your cards

This is not Theft of Tournament Materials; that infraction has a clear definition

It is possible you will run into someone who quotes a line about cards belonging to the Tournament Organizer until the end of the tournament. For that, where we find that line. Two important things about it:

1. It appears in a standalone paragraph about procedures for tournaments where the organizer allows players to bring their own packs with them.
2. The *full* line is: ""Players are not considered to own the cards until the tournament finishes **or they legally drop.**""

And we already know, assuming that it was just bizarrely placed in a paragraph about a weird unusual procedure, despite actually applying to all tournaments even if they don't use that procedure -- the cards are the property of the player as of the moment they say ""I'm dropping"".

This is not new information. This is not a recent policy change. It's been like this for a good long while. But still

1365187422.0,1br08y,[DGM] What we can tell Dragon's Maze just from Render Silent.,bokchoykn,524,81,157,"This is going to be very detailed and a bit long winded but here goes...

* Dragon's Maze has 156 cards

* The ten Guildgates

* Each card in a set is assigned a ""Collector's Number"", #141-210 = Multicolor, #211-225 = Hybrid; #226-238 = Artifact; #239-249 = Land. [See here.](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?sort=cn+&amp;output=checklist&amp;action=advanced&amp;set=[""Gatecrash""])

* Cards within the same ""color"" are then subsequently given Collector's Numbers in **alphabetical order**. 

* All multicolor and hybrid cards are considered as the same ""color"" for the purpose of assigning Collector's Numbers. Only the fact that they are *multicolor* or *hybrid* is observed

* Maze's End's Collector Number is 152/156. There are four lands that succeed Maze's End alphabetically. We already know that they are: Orzhov Guildgate, and Simic Guildgate. Not a lot of information here.

Here's the biggie...

**[Render Silent](http://imgur.com/hJQBQBa)'s Collector's Number is 96/156.** 

* 60 cards succeed Render's Silent in Collector's Number. At least 11 of them are Non-Basic Lands. The rest of them are Multicolored (alphabetically after *Render Silent*), or Non-Basic Lands (alphabetically before *Maze's End*)

* At #96/156, Render Silent would have been 76.4% down the list. This implies that there are a ton of Multicolor, Hybrid, Artifact, or Non-Basic Lands, and a relatively small number of monocolored spells.

From this we can reasonably conclude that *(unless Dragon's Maze has a ton of artifacts)*...

**Dragon's Maze is at least very heavily multicolored ~~and is very possibly entirely Multicolored.~~**

**IMPORTANT EDIT:**

I crunched the numbers again

Alphabetically

If there were 70 Multicolored cards in the set and Render Silent was the 46th of them, or Land cards that we don't already know about.

**My final prediction:**

&gt; **~ 50 Mono-colored**

&gt; **~ 70 Multi-colored**

&gt; **~ 25 Hybrid/Artifact** (Maybe a 20/5 split)

&gt; **~ 11 Non-Basic Land**

(Compare to Gatecrash)

&gt; 140 Mono-colored

&gt; 70 Multi-colored

&gt; 15 Hybrid

&gt; 13 Artifact

&gt; 11 Land

1374658051.0,1iy37g,A Small PSA: Just because Sun Titan is in the new Duel Decks does NOT mean the Titans are coming back,Sephiroth912,523,120,143,"This has really been bugging me the fact that people are constantly insisting the titans are coming back in Theros and having to repeat myself, shows a LOT of people suddenly showing their excitement that the titans are coming back. For better or worse

At first glance it seems like they would be. They're titans, with Wizards stating they were even hesitant to reprint them in M12 because of the divisiveness they created among players, but wanted to give people who bought into them another go with them. This is one reason, but hardly compelling enough.

The big giveaway though lies not with a product from this year, Golgari Lich Lord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=292771) and...a reprint of [Niv-Mizzet, the Firemind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=292738). This got the Magic community abuzz for a little while. We all knew that Niv-Mizzet was coming back in RTR since he was practically the face of the set alongside Jace and so many people started wondering if we were getting a new Niv-Mizzet or a reprint of the old one. [We wound up with the former.](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253626) Why is this so important? It shows the start of a trend in these Duel Deck products: reprinting one classic card as a mythic and one new mythic. Given that they've shown us the two mythics in the set already (or at least the names and arts of them), it's clear to say that [Sun Titan](http://i.imgur.com/WAbAuDB.jpg) is the classic reprint (and while the titans are rather new, they will likely be classic cards regardless in their own right and are very on-flavor with Theros as mentioned before) and [Polukranos, World Eater](http://i.imgur.com/v1wMbhy.jpg) is the new mythic.

My third and final piece of reasoning for this is a really simple one: Putting the full cycle of titans in Theros heavily constricts design space. A typical large set has approximately 15 mythics in it, and Dragon's Maze due to the use of different sheets for the transform cards and the gates/shocks/Maze's End, but so far this set doesn't have some odd gimmick that would allow that. The Gods use a different frame, sure, but so did Miracles and they weren't printed on a different sheet. What that means is that were they to print the titans once again, they would be using 5 of 15 mythic slots on reprints, which is a highly unreasonable expectation of them for a non-core or non-reprint set. In fact, Mindslaver was the only direct reprint. What this means is that putting 5 titans into a set like this means 5 less mythic slots for brand new cards which are meant to sell the set. This does not mean that they can't create new titans and maybe reprint one of them

So to conclude, I implore you to not get your hopes up, as given a couple of telling signs, they will most likely *not* be coming back with this year's fall expansion and back into standard.",,False,,False,t3_1iy37g

1350538934.0,11od4v,"Dear Wizards, Standard is far too expensive right now. Here's why, in my humble opinion.",interesting_username,641,563, please just hear me out for a moment or two.

I've played since last May when NPH released right at the height of JtMS and Caw Blade so I'm no stranger to blisteringly expensive decks, fewer and fewer players are going to want to play Type 2. Now, you may be thinking, ***""Hey jackass, WotC has no control over secondary market prices""*** Well, I'm here to tell you, **that's just not true.** 

Here's what I perceive to be the biggest barriers to getting into Standard right now and here's what WotC can do about it.

**1. The Shocklands** - The re-print of the shocklands was supposed to herald a new age of modern wherein players could build the mana base for a competitive deck without having to drop large sums of money. Instead what has happened is the demand for shocks has been so high and the amount of them readily available on the market has kept the prices in the $14-$18 range. This means that for a player who wants to run a 2-color deck

**2. Mythic Endgame Cards** - In the past couple of blocks we've had a number of choices for cards used as endgame finishers or capstones to a deck. More often than not, 5 out the 6 Titans (yes, we're counting Wurmcoil Engine) were printed as promos. This means that two printings worth of Titans were available to players. Wizards' rationale for reprinting the Titans was that players wanted to feel like their big huge Mythic cards were worth something for a longer period of time. Prices remained high, usually in the $10-20 range for a Titan, but they never spiraled out of control like Bonfire,  Jace, Architect of Thought, $30 for a *sideboard* card!) have. Buying a playset of Titans was a big investment in a deck

**Okay, WotC quelled that by including it in an Event Deck. The inclusion sold more Event Decks for Wizards and drove the price down for everyone else. Throwing a couple of shocklands in each Event Deck would tremendously help players trying to get into the format. **And Two, they can (re)start giving away *good* Mythic Rares as promos.** I know it sounds like it would hurt sales, but when you're introduced to a new set and someone hands you a Grave Titan or a Wurmcoil engine for free, you're overwhelmed by the sheer awesomeness of the card and you immediately start trying to build around it. Maybe you go out and buy 3 more Grave Titans or 3 more Wurmcoils, but without that first one to ignite your spark, so to speak
 
As a final note, but if the secondary market value of each of those cards is so high that its stunts the growth of the community, sales of packs will also be stunted along with sales of sleeves, playmats, deckboxes and all the other stuff WotC licenses. It's not worth killing the community's wallets just to keep peoples perception of pack value high. **In summary, pricier cards won't lead to more sales, a larger and more financially accessible community will.**

Anyway, and one other person, though I have to go back through my notes and find that person's Reddit name. I received a box a few days back from that person, too, but haven't been able to thank him because I don't have anything but his real-life name. 

Anyway, but I have to download and edit them, then I'll post the picture of my kid and the wonderful items you folks sent. I'll also get the correct name of the other sender and post back here. 

Thank you ALL You are truly wonderful and have done more nice stuff in this one matter than you may actually realize. Bless you all!",,t5_2qn5f,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/143aqz/update_stolen_cards_omg_rmagictcg_you_are_awesome/

Two years ago in early Spring, called Icons.  There were naysayers and those who disagreed with his business model, and his location, but for 2 and a half magnificent years, he succeeded.  The store was small, but clean and organized.  The players area was always open, and took more than half of the store all to itself.  The selection was not vast, supplies constant

I had been out of magic for some time, and engage the community once again.  

If anything, strangers, enemies, people-who-will-become-your-friends....it's not just 2 sweaty dudes in a basement.  It's the mother of two who gets out once a week to do FNM.  It's the college kid who is wheeling his best-he-can-afford deck.  It's the netdeck specialist.  It's the crazy-combo-kid who wins once in a while, in spectacular fashion.  It's the people that make us play, and give us the stage for the huge plays we make.  I remember my best plays, much like everybody else does, when it happened

Sitting in the backroom there, Draft and EDH games.  Two-Headed Giant had recently become a rotating favorite, with a 2HG Sealed being the last variation of it we tried.  We even did Legacy and Modern to less frequent nights, and Pauper once or twice.  We did an 8-week league.  We did a 4-of-a-kind-nothing-banned tourney (minus Unglued/Unhinged) that was off the hook.

But there, and then his wife.  I re-met a friend I had lost touch with for 10 years plus, and his new fiancee, and ended up being in his wedding party.  I met a guy who lived across the street from me, who was related to one of my best friends, that I NEVER met in 8 years of being on the same street.  Just random chance.  And those are just the ones off the top of my head.

I spent oodles at the store.  Sure, but he would always order for you, and never charge shipping.  He did 3 packs for 10 on Fridays.....and everyday for his routine customers.  He also gave 30% off singles everyday for his routine customers.  His Black Friday sales last year were 50% off all singles, and this year, 60% off all singles.  We gorged.

On Monday afternoon I got the news that the store was going to close for good on Wednesday.  Realistically, playing their last hands before heading home.  Today will be all packing, with heavy hearts.  Monday felt a lot like a funeral, as everyone gathered to play in one last RTR Draft.  Everyone played, and whether rivals or not, all shook hands, and wished each other well.  The store owner fought back tears the whole night, his dream

When asked about the store, or anything of the sort.  He said that he wanted a place for kids to be able to come after school, and hangout for free, and play games, and socialize.  He had family board games night, where he would rip open a new board game and let the kids all play with it.  He had free Pokemon tourneys.  He would provide pizza and sodas for tourneys far too small to support them, ALONG with prize support.  He would speak of upcoming events

But never once about financial hardship, and making an experience, for US.

So today, please be kind to your owners.  Thank them for all the struggling and hardship that they've had to endure, and for providing a clean, stable environment for you, and do whatever you can to help them.  You get out of these places what you put into them.  I just wish there was more we could have done to save this one.

I want to assuage some of these fears with some of the following clarifications.

You cannot get a game loss or match loss at an FNM. This goes for drafts

There are only two options whenever a judge is called upon at the Regular REL and something has gone wrong.

1. Fix it. Fix it now.

2. Disqualify someone.

99% of the time, threatening, or hurtful.

FNMs, and FNM is definitely the place to make such errors.

I mean

Drawing an extra card
Competitive: Game Loss.
Regular: Put the card back on top. If you aren't sure which card

Looking at extra cards of own deck
Competitive: Warning. Randomize the cards that are unknown in the deck.
Regular: Randomize the cards that are unknown in the deck.

Illegal card in deck
Competitive: Game loss. Replace card with basic land of player's choice.
Regular: Replace card with card of player's choice.

We're really just around to fix problems and make sure people have a fun time. I judge and play in my local FNM,False,,t5_2qn5f,False,,text,t3_s16yz

1338580032.0,ug3cz,"Passing the Jace Test: Past, Present, and Future",jjness,403,89, on the state of ""creatures matter"" Magic

For the last two years of Standard

For background

Early cards that passed the Jace Test were Avenger of Zendikar, whose haste could combat Jace and whose cascade would further your board position. Classic cards that couldn't pass the Jace test were Phyrexian Obliterator or Baneslayer Angel, cards that cost you all that land and time, only to be found in your hand before they could ever tap sideways.

Jace's presence helped define the Titan cycle as the highest echelon of creatures in recent history: they were creatures that did something as soon as they resolved, and in fact, bouncing them only fogged 6 damage the next turn, as recasting them provided the same benefits that attacking with them would have.

After Jace and Stoneforge received the ban-hammers, but the Jace Test demanded respect, and people were still conscious of it. 

Let's fast forward now to our current environment, and bouncing Elesh Norn is probably worse EV than scooping up your Delver deck and going to game 2.

As a compliment to the Jace Test, we've enjoyed just that. Slagstorms and Whipflares help control a R/G or R/B aggro deck but Strangleroot Geists, Gravediggers, and Geralf's Messengers just shrug it off like a pesky mosquito. Even Gloom Surgeon has seen some play as annoying chump blocker of the hour in the Blood Artist decksat GP Minneapolis for his ability to hold off both of the swings from a Strangleroot Geist. Pod decks have all manner of Enter the Battlefield effects on their creatures, and often time the mere effect is worth the Pod activation.

Now let's turn our scopes forward a year. We've lost Vapor Snag and I don't know if Delver will remain the same deck that it is now (Unsummon ~~costing an extra mana~~ (sorry for the misinformation, and we'll still have Undying creatures. Is our metric for gauging ""good"" creatures going to ever change? Will we ever be satisfied again with a Baneslayer Angel reprint?

People are already looking forward to Titan-less Standard, and we lose our titans and titan-lites such as Elesh Norn and Consecrated Sphynx. Presumably we'll still have people trying Snapcaster tempo decks, especially if a functional one-mana bounce spell sees print in M13 or Return to Ravnica. We'll still have Victim of Night, Doom Blade, and other spot removal spells from Black.

Many people like to regurgitate the mantra ""Saying 'It dies to Doom Blade' isn't a good analyses of the card."" when analyzing creatures. I posit that it has been a very relevant criteria for our creatures for the past two years, cheap monster well above the power curve, because it’s a time walk to get it bounced or destroyed.  Now the only reason we might run Phyrexian Obliterator is when we can Pod into it without losing our 3 drop in the process, and only one deck archetype can profitably deal with him. In fact, no deck will probably ever run Hypnotic Specter or Serra Angel again, even though those were once the pinnacle of Magic's creatures.

We have been trained to respect the Jace Test, who can keep a creature tapped down indefinitely, ensuring that if you received no benefit from it yet, you never will.  We expect our creatures to do something for us the moment they hit play, whether it be an Enter the Battlefield effect or to represent resilience to sweepers/removal.  We expect our 1-drop to swing for 3 next turn, be it a Delver or Champion of the Parish. We expect our generic giant beaters of yesterday to not be so generic today; Dungrove Elder wouldn’t see play if it didn’t have Hexproof. It's a passing of age for the Magic community, and is reflected in deckbuilding choices by the players

When you are building your decks, the shadow of the Jace Test will continue to fall upon us.

About the author: I first started playing MtG Christmas of 94, but I wanted to at least share my ideas and maybe even get some feedback on my writing. Hopefully more discussion from better players will continue below, so that even I may learn something from this!
