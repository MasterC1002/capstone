5 years ago.

I, went to church every Sunday etc.  

When the time came to go on a mission I was ""excited"" because that's what you've been looking forward to since you we're 8 years old! It was the next step.

My first WTF moment was going through the temple

But I went with it

So

Learning the correct way to ""teach"" and pretty much lie by omission about the truth of church history.

I was going crazy and just had to get out of there

I didn't know how to get out of there

It worked

But after for the first time of actually researching Mormonism and finding out how crazy it actually is...it was the most freeing experience ever.  Like being pulled from the Matrix.

After about a year, the normal stuff, but they still love me.


The whole depression thing is all in the past

I also remember only getting $120 a month for food

So

I sent my wife outside with the groceries and caught the elders in line. I said, ""Are you sure?"" I said, ""Yup. Just remember that us exmormons aren't all bad."" Smiles and handshakes all around. Profuse thanks. 

It felt really good to help them out. They were genuinely grateful. And it was nice to reclaim some of what I had lost in being angry at the church for the last few years.

First, and above all enlightening. The expertise of the professors was in one (or more) of the following three categories:

Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica Anthropology
Egyptology

Here is the letter to the Egyptology professors.

https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5HfF_gsLNwnRmx0bUozd1FHR1U/edit?usp=sharing

I usually added something to the letter that was specific to the receiver like their work in a specific country

I have a few remarks before I give the names and responses of the professors. I am aware that the Ex-Mormon subreddit had a post in the past where three professors from UCLA responded to questions about the Book of Abraham and a BYU professor who made a YouTube video regarding the Book of Abraham. I also recall that the title of the thread was “Peer Review is a B****.” I also know that FAIR gave a very detailed response to this post

*  To FAIR: I welcome any response you wish to give. Perhaps I went wrong somewhere in my research that you wish to point out or you want to make a post just to say hello to me… I encourage any response. I hope your post will be just as professional and will refrain from the very ad-hominem attacks that I discourage as well. 

*  I want to thank the Ex-Mormon subreddit. The truth is that I made this post on a special date. A year ago from tomorrow, I would not be attending church anymore. Today I will be sharing this information with not just you, Ex-Mormons, but also my bishop. I am going to print out a packet with this information and show him how far I have come in the past year. I went from a kid who knew next to nothing about the church and its history to a man who reads philosophy and theology books in his free time, along with emailing professors about their opinions on matters that relate to their expertise.
I will never forget the week I told my bishop I would stop attending. I made a post on this subreddit titled “Talk with Bishop” and received over twenty responses, for taking the time to help guys like me.

*  Finally, from a quote by Alejandro Jodorowski. “Birds born in a cage think flying is an illness.”

I'm going to be straight up with you. This subreddit has a bias.  We think it all isn't true.  That being said; we have a passion for good historical evidence.  We're not that angry or bitter as they make us seem during the ""us or them"" talks in Sunday School.  Many of us still attend church

Is there some bitter?  Sure.  But it's the same bitter that the victims of Bernie Madoff felt when they learned their life savings were gone.  We were banking on this

Why are we still obsessed by the church?  Honestly,000 people who leave the church ever year](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/ilkav/byu_law_professor_frederick_mark_gedicks_as_many/) most of them you never hear from.  Those of us who are vocal are typically stuck with family in the organization, and attacked weekly about our beliefs.

So what does that mean for you?  Well

Bare in mind the bias... but simply because there is a bias doesn't mean that all information should be rejected. (Church manuals and FAIR/The Maxwell Institute are biased too!)

If not, and think.  It's a glorious thing to have a brain, and we invite all to use it.

1357585412.0,164tc5,Mission experience that caused my first spark of anger against the church.,DLStephens,202,30,100,"For some background I was called to serve in the Tacloban Philippines mission. Its the poorest mission in the Philippines which is already a 3rd world country. I leared to speak Cebuano

This experience I would like to share happened in my first area Catbalogan. I was still super culture shocked and mostly just followed my companion around like a zombie all day. It didn't help that I could barely communicate with the people because of the multi-lingual barrier. 

One hot and sweaty day (every day) we were going to teach a new investigator who lived under a tarp on the side of the filth strewn street. While teaching we would just squat in the road because it was too dirty to sit anywhere. The investigator was a man in his mid 40s who was as skinny as the people you see in the concentration camp pictures after being starved to death. He wore several grocery bags wrapped around his waist for a loincloth.

He admitted to us that because he was to weak to do anything but beg from under the tarp he wasn't getting food or money to feed himself. He was slowly starving to death. He would kill cockroaches and eat them if they came to close to his tarp and that was all he had for sustenance.

After our lesson my companion and I were riding a motorcycle back to our apartment and I asked him if I could buy some food for the investigator. My companion said that he didn't think we were allowed to help the locals because of the mission's rules but I could call the Mission President to ask him.

That night I called our Mission President to ask if I could use my personal funds to feed the poor dying man. I really felt good about this like even though I couldn't speak the langauge I could bring some happiness into this man's life. My Mission President told me in no uncertain terms that I could not assist this man in any temporal way. He urged me to let this man feast from the words of Christ.

A week passed and we went back to teach this investigator. He didn't answer us as we approached his tarp so we flipped up the front flap of the tarp and found him curled in a ball dead. The stench was unbelievable. For a few minutes I just stared at the body of one of my first investigators.

It was the first dead person I had ever seen and I could have done something to save him. My lack of action killed this man. That was the first time I felt geniune anger at the church I had served since I was born. Because of my Mission President's lack of concern with this man's temporal well being he died. 

The anger and shame of this experience is still with me today and was a focal point to me investigating the validity of the church. 

I thought this would be a good place to share my story.

My wife’s father passed away suddenly of a heart attack 2 months before the date of our wedding. We didn't know how to handle the shock emotionally and before you knew it we were no longer “temple worthy.” Sadly we know many people who should not have married in the temple but lied to save face with their families

We had informed both her Mother and my parents that one thing led to another and that we were no longer worthy to marry in the temple. They took the news better than we thought they would
The word quickly got around. Since my wife wasn't endowed yet she was put on a formal probation where as I was dis-fellowshipped because I had been through the temple already at that time. We were still active at the time and everyone could put two and two together seeing a couple engaged to be and eventually married sitting next to each other at church every Sunday not being allowed to take the sacrament. 

To make matters worse my wife has family members that are general authorities. If you've ever had to sit through general conference and have had the displeasure of being condescended to from the pulpit from a skinny 

Once word reached her uncle that we weren't going to have a temple marriage he flew in to harass my Mother in law because we didn't deserve a nice wedding after what we had done and that she shouldn't be spending money on a wedding after just having paid for a funeral. He even visited the venue where the wedding was going to take place and pulled the “don’t you know who I am?” card to try to get them to give back the deposit. 

We finally went down to the courthouse and picked up a marriage license about 6 weeks before the wedding was going to take place. We presented the certificate to her Mother and informed her that we planned on going to the courthouse in the next few days as we would rather just be married and be done with the ridiculousness rather than have to go through the embarrassment of a DI budget wedding that her uncle would want forced on us. Her mother suddenly found her courage at this point telling the uncle that he better mind his own business and that she would see to it that her daughter had a proper wedding

Fast forward a year
Aside from our parents and a small handful of friends there was no one there we actually cared about. Everyone else at the ceremony was there purely for show. The Uncle and the Aunt

Fast forward a few more years. My wife admits that the temple was a traumatic experience for her, “do you really think these questions are important to get into the Celestial kingdom?” It wouldn't be too long before I would lose the garments as well. 

Fast forward to today. We've been married 10 years today. We spent part of the weekend alone together celebrating, materialistic things that we aren't supposed to care about but that make us happy when we are able to obtain them Hell, just being able to enjoy a bottle of wine and a porno together like normal people the rest of the world over are able to do. 

After 10 years I can say that our marriage is still going strong not because of the church

Thank you for letting me share our story.

I'm proud to say that I will NOT be going on a mission when I turn 18, that I am no longer part of the LDS church. Rather than turning in papers to serve a mission, I'll be turning in my resignation letter to get my name removed from the church. I'm done.""

Of course

Oh how I wish I didn't do that. I got grounded by my parents for posting something like that (my dad said I didn't need to post what I feel if it's ex-mormon) and I got a whole bunch of phone calls/texts from my leaders. The worst part was my bishop fucking came over to my house THAT NIGHT at fucking 9:00 PM.

The whole family sat in my living room as the bishop talked about Jesus and blah blah blah, bishop, and I don't think I ever did."" He was taken back at this statement and so was I! I just said that in front of my mom, dad, brother and sister. He went on to take out his scriptures and try to preach to me and my family for an hour. He asked if he could meet with me later that week, and of course with my whole family in the room, I responded yes and we decided to meet Friday morning.

From that night when I posted the status on Facebook till that Friday morning

Then Friday came and I went over to the church for my meeting with the bishop. I was grounded so of course my mom had to drive me there seeing as they can't trust me and I went inside by myself. The bishop didn't feel like small talk much and got right down to business. He said he wanted to talk about the church which really meant he wanted me to sit there quietly while he read off what seemed to be the whole Book of Mormon. After about an hour and half of him talking he asked me what I was feeling right now

""Mundo53

""No thank you

""Well you can turn in your letter but I won't accept it seeing as you're still 17. How about next Sunday we meet again?""

""Mmm

""Are you sure

""I'm positive.""

MY GOD DID THAT FEEL GOOD. Haven't heard from him since.

But real quick

TL;DR Finally turned down a meeting with my bishop.

The video would start with a couple young teen kids playing in a park and one sitting a little bit away from the others. A middle aged man, out of the blue he asks, ""Do you masturbate?"" The kid is clearly alarmed. 

New scene

Man walks up to young adult couple. ""Have you two had sex?"" They are shocked

Scene cuts again to a close up of a young girls face. We hear the same man's voice asking her if she touches herself. The girl is obviously uncomfortable and creeped out. The camera slowly pulls back as the man asks her more questions and we see that they're sitting in a bishop's office.

**Me:** Nope

**Me:** How about you? How have you been?

**Old Friend:** Ah

**Me:** Oh, haha.

**Old Friend:** No ward? How does that work?

**Me:** I don't go to church.

**Old Friend:** You don't? Why not?

**Me:** Well

**Old Friend:** :O

**Old Friend:** What happened!?

**Me (not really wanting to get into it in any detail because there is no version of that conversation that isn't uncomfortable):** Just not for me.

**Old Friend:** What do you mean?

**Me:** I'd really rather not get into it

**Old Friend:** Was it a chastity thing?

**Me:** No

**Old Friend:** Man

**Me (sighing because I'm being suckered into this discussion):** I've read it. When I was a member

**Old Friend:** Did you just want to sin?

**Me:** Really

**Old Friend:** Come on

**Me:** I don't want to talk about my opinions and beliefs right now. I respect that you believe things I don't

**Old Friend:** I'd rather you explained it to me personally.

**(a few minutes pass)**

**Old Friend:** David?

**Old Friend:** Look

**Me:** No, but I don't believe it personally.

**Old Friend:** Yes you do! You're just telling yourself otherwise so you can live in the world.

**Me:** Why do you need to turn this into a rumspringa?

**Old Friend:** It's true, and you're just being selfish. You'll come around.

**Me:** Okay.

**Me:** You're projecting

**Old Friend:** I wish I'd been here to keep you from straying.

**Me:** Let's not talk about this

**Old Friend:** No

**Me:** Okay

**Old Friend:** The only reason you have to get mad is that you know I'm right.

**Me:** I think we're done here.

**Old Friend:** If I'm so wrong

**Old Friend:** I'll pray for you to find your way back to the truth.

**Me (finally snapping):** Okay

**Me:** I grew up believing in the church because my parents and all of my friends were members

**Me:** From very early on

**Me:** Figure myself out. I looked at it honestly for the first time in my life, omnibenevolent god makes no sense. The church's stance on homosexuality is cruel and not the kind of thing a loving god could ever endorse.

**Me:** The entire religion is laced through with misogyny and racism. The laws of chastity are outdated

**Me:** The tendency to scientific denialism when it comes to our universe's origins and physical laws that isn't specific to Mormonism but comes along with most organized religion certainly doesn't help things at all.

**Old Friend:** How have you become so hard-hearted? This isn't like you. What happened to you?

**Me:** I paid fucking attention in church.

**Old Friend:** No need to get vulgar. Bad language is just proof that you're not thinking about any of this rationally. If you'd let yourself calm down

**Me:** You wanted my reasons

**Me:** The sacred text central to the church is bad fanfiction for a wildly irrelevant and outdated anthology of shitty, might I add, heavily edited) by a bunch of old men with a multitude of agendas over 2,000 years ago.

**Me:** Its founder was a horny farmboy (admittedly charismatic

**Me:** CHURCH HISTORY.

**Me:** So there

**Old Friend:** How did you get so hateful? You used to be so cool. I'm so sorry you let Satan into your heart. You're just playing right into his lies

Like many other missionaries I suffered from a lot of self hatred on my mission. This hatred stemmed from the belief that failure was the result of laziness and disobedience.  I was hardly perfect on my mission but I tried so damn hard and worked my ass off.  

Anyway, trying to sleep the self hatred became exceptionally profound.  It was so overwhelming that I couldn't take it so I got out of bed and woke up my parents. With my eyes full of tears and without going into specifics I asked my father for a blessing.

Of all the blessings he's given me, not because the problem went away but because I believed I would soon feel the spirit which would make everything better.

I got back into bed and began to wait for the promised manifestation. As the hours passed the self hate returned. The next morning when I saw my mom she asked if I felt better

Over the next few days I began to question why I had not received the promised experience.  In my mind the only logical conclusion was that I was the broken part of the equation.  God was there and probably loved me

“Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree


In eighth grade, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.”



As I taught Sunday school for the last 9 months or so, I’d like to modify this quote to fit the intent of my talk this afternoon. “Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a non-Mormon on their ability to be a Mormon, they will live their whole life feeling inferior.” Not only will they feel inferior, but you will miss many opportunities to learn and grow.



One of my greatest personal heroes is Tenzin Gyatso- the Dalai Lama. He is the fourteenth Dalai Lama and the leader of Tibetan Buddhism. He said “This is my simple religion... the philosophy is kindness” If you boil down our religion to the most basic form



So let us not let our first thoughts of someone be concerned with whether or not they drink coffee or smoke, or what religion they affiliate with. Let our first thoughts be an eagerness and willingness to learn from them and to show them kindness.



We must look past affiliations and be willing to teach and learn kindness from everyone. Newly elected Pope of the Catholic church- Pope Francis has this to say on the subject: “Dialogue is born from an attitude of respect for the other person, and proposal. To dialogue entails a cordial reception, not a prior condemnation. In order to dialogue it is necessary to know how to lower the defenses, open the doors of the house, and offer human warmth.”



The Dalai Lama, we find that they work on the basis of cooperation even though they have no religion, constitution, or laws. Their natural form and way of life demand that they work together; otherwise, they cannot survive. Humans claim to be superior beings but we are, in fact, sometimes inferior to these small insects. Our basic situation demands that we live together, we work together. It is a natural law but sometimes we act in quite the contrary manner.”



I hope that as I go through a few more teachings from the Pope and the Dalai Lama that you will give it a cordial reception.



On the subject of those with means becoming protectors of humanity, as the Book of Genesis tells us and as Saint Francis of Assisi showed us. It means respecting each of God’s creatures and respecting the environment in which we live. It means protecting people, showing loving concern for each and every person, especially children, the elderly, those in need, who are often the last we think about. It means caring for one another in our families: husbands and wives first protect one another, as parents, protect their parents. It means building sincere friendships in which we protect one another in trust, and all of us are responsible for it” This is no different than any advice given to us by our leaders in general conference.



Again, eventually you’ll be the loser. Thus, the basic structure of human society requires a sense of responsibility based on altruism and compassion. The ultimate source of happiness is altruism. Success in life depends on determination, will and courage. And the source of this courage and determination is altruism. Sometimes anger and hatred create a kind of energy and determination. This determination, however, rarely has good consequences because the energy created by anger and jealousy is blind, harmful and can even be fatal.”


	
In the same speech, but we are not free from the need for human affection. A baby cannot survive without it.”



How true that is. In all situations when we are alone or defenseless- like we are at birth, a homemade meal, or a shoulder to cry on. Don’t let religion get in the way of being more like Christ. Don’t let sexual orientation, political affiliations, race, health, income


Brother (redacted) asked me to speak on revelation and I feel I have done just that. In the Pope’s and Dalai Lama’s effort to do good and help people

I was followed by a sister RM. Then the stake president. He gets up and says how thankful he is for the Sister's testimony (calling her by name). then says something along the lines of ""and of course for Brother... this brother's insights"" Yay

A prophet received personal wisdom from Christ

This prophet dies without leaving a clear succession path, a revelation there, a letter from the original prophet over there.  Things get fairly ugly at times, with each group claiming to be the ""true"" church.  the various leaders of the rival sects even excommunicate each other on more than one occasion.

Each sect tries to take with it what its leader and followers believe to be the most important parts of the gospel, certain members of the various sects look back on history and realize that their church isn't doing things the way they were done in the original church, so they try to reform it.  Sometimes, they try to change it from within, and sometimes, they break off, forming new groups that believe as they do - reformationists, who are trying to get back to what the church originally was.

The largest and most powerful group, it simplifies its teachings.  It picks and chooses from the scriptures, and reduces its doctrine down to the absolute ""bare essentials"", while ignoring or hiding some of the more ""uncomfortable"" parts of its past.  Eventually, this sect evolves so much that it no longer even resembles the church set up by the original prophet.

Now that that scenario is in your mind, of course, be wrong.  The prophet is Joseph Smith, and the ""largest and most powerful group"" would be the Brighamite, or mainstream LDS sect.

It's no secret, he left behind a succession crisis.  What most TBMs *don't* know is the extent of this crisis.  Many of them have never even heard the name James Strang, and they don't know that the popular story of Brigham speaking and appearing with Joseph's countenance doesn't have a single contemporary source (every account we have of this so-called phenomenon was written years after the fact).  They don't know that Brigham required everyone that followed him to be re-baptized into *his* church, making it absolutely clear that they were moving on from Joseph's church.

Furthermore, prayer/scripture reading, and ""the atonement"".  The church then was a place where one could expect a random congregation member to stand up and begin yammering away in ""the pure adamic language"", not unlike the ""speaking in tongues"" that happens in some born-again congregations.  The church members of today would probably try to have you committed, or at the very least quietly removed from the meeting, if you happened to break into glossolalia.  The church of then was a place where women would exercise the ability to anoint and bless the sick.  The church of now has been known to discipline women who even express a *desire* to perform priesthood ordinances (hell, as we've seen over the last week or so

At which point I cried. I never thought they would be able to accept me. I never dreamed that they would even attempt to understand why this is the path I've chosen. 

So there you go /r/exmormon. Not all TBM parents are crazy and intolerant. I've been really lucky here. In fact

The lds church never sent a confirmation letter back i assumed i wasnt a member anymore.  Well last christmas i learned the truth the church called up my mom and told them i wanted to leave and asked her if i should get me records removed. She said no. So they didnt. She didnt tell me this of course and kept quiet about it. Guess trying to sneak me into heaven i dont know. I'm thirty. Im well past a legal adult and can make my own decissions. Rather infuriating.

This last friday i got a letter sent to my business address asking for my current address so they can send and update my records to my current ward. I have literally not stepped foot into a church since i left my parents house after high school.  I was raging mad that not only had the lds church not removed me but now were actively bothering me. I have a female employee who is going through a similar problem where they send letters to her inlaws house

The next day after receiving the letter my parents called up to say they were in town and wanted to go eat lunch together.  I went and right as i met them in the parking lot i told them we are probably going to have a fight. Then i told them i put in my paper to be removed from the church and i know they were called and told them no. I explained it was extremely disrespectful they ignored my own decissions and wishes etc. my mom screamed and cried at me for about an hour in the parking lot. My dad wouldnt even look at me.  Some of the highlights of my moms histerical hissy fit were she threatened to run into on coming traffic. I literally had to hug her and hold her out of fear she would make good on her crazy threat. At another point she was saying my life is too good and i need to hit rock bottom so i need to turn to god. Then at another point she said she wished i was dead rather than leave the church. She also said it would be better if i got in a car wreck and got paralized. And at yet another point she was screaming why couldnt i just have waited till they were dead to leave the church and i was doing this just to hurt her.  I could go on and on about the crazy crazy crazy statements she was yelling at me.  It was all rather heart breaking.

I went home and literally just laid in my bath tub till 10pm.  Such utter bullshit.

I watched one of my semi-good friends dance - literally dance - with giddiness, position.

I really don't know how much longer I can take this place. If I had a dollar for every LDS pretense that I've encountered, I'd have more money than Mitt. 

Only the ""wise"" Mormons know that the Word of Wisdom cannot possibly be a health code, but nope - not Mormons; in an act of sheer duplicity, Mormons will simultaneously refrain from coffee and tea and somehow still have the courage to question a familiar authority which forces, say, Islamic women to wear burqas. Caffeine isn't against the word of wisdom (as the lds newsroom oddly needed to clarify), and yet, BYU soda machines are caffeine free.

And then there's the big happy families that Mormons purport to create. Perhaps at the risk of sounding conceited, Mormons ought to be awarded in some way, for successfully using the fallacy to rid themselves of the millions of exceptions. A miraculous achievement.

It really is appalling. At the risk of sounding too reductionistic, both of which are ruthlessly contorted to confirm and reconfirm church doctrines. I'm surprised that Mormons haven't grown thoraxes after a century of bee imagery (which, true to his faith, Ballard reiterated yet again this last eventful Sunday). I am amazed by the amount of contradictions  that Mormons are able to uphold, without the slightest twinge of cognitive dissonance, but the one contradiction that amazes me the most is the paralyzing amount of pragmatism that Latter Day Saints live by. I still remember the day in seminary where one kid legitimately, and wisely, I learned what Nietzche meant when he said that Christianity was the real one guilty of nihilism. My father understands my concerns (somewhat/superficially) with the church, we are told that we aren't ready to fulfill these quixotic

Tells me this change and the decision to leave the standards will instantly and assuredly ruin my life and I will die in a drunk driving accident. WHAT CHANGE. If I wanted to drink or smoke or sleep around, I WOULDN'T HAVE TO LEAVE THE FUCKING CHURCH. I could just do it and lie about it later like a good Mormon. This poor excuse of a conversation continues on by him saying something and me providing a rebuttal using church doctrine. He asks why did I even marry his daughter 6 years ago if I had doubt. I answer by saying WE ARE TAUGHT TO SUPPRESS DOUBT. Would *you* do any different? Didn't think so. I had doubt, but suppressed it on the terms the church set up.

As I have posted before, then for the time being that is what I would do.

Fast forward a few months later. One night we were having a (by this time normal) conversation about why I did not believe. I remember I told her that I could not support a church that continued to prosecute gays via support proposition 8

Rapidly over the next few weeks she began to read sites like mormonthink, as she did not believe that it happened as explained by the manual. I suggested that she might skip to a more palatable lesson, but my wife is a person more brave than I, and insisted in going to church to tell the Primary President why she couldn't teach that lesson.

I just wanted to share this

**EDIT: Update 1

So my wife talked to the PP after sacrament meeting. She explained her specific problems about the material (three witnesses lesson) and told the PP that if she was going to teach the lesson, so be honest and that if the kids had questions about her answers to tell them to ask their parents. My wife proceeded to teach the lesson, not in an ""anti"" style, but being honest about some of the facts that the lesson manual conveniently avoids. Later that day the PP called my wife and told her that she could continue teaching as long as she wanted, or if she was having a hard time that she could be released, whichever was beter for her. One of the kids in the class is the bishop's son, so we will see how it goes. My wife and I are really hoping that we can become a ward project so that we can bask in the overflow of various baked goods.

Yesterday morning I was running about 5 minutes late for church (I still go because I live with my parents and love and respect them) and was expecting to just drive myself over. My dad then stayed behind to take me
 
""Lets walk, but they can't seem to come to grips with it. On the walk to church my dad asks me how things are going with my girlfriend (of almost 2 years), and I say it's all good. He then asks me if I want a temple marriage, ""no..."" I timidly say. 

""But doesn't she want a temple marriage!?""

""Not really...""

""Why not?""

I proceed to explain to him some of my future plans and I tell him a story. My girlfriend and I have talked about the possibility of marriage but have decided that it is best to not jump into  it. We have the idea to wait four years (when we would both be graduated from college) and see where we're at then. If we still love eachother and all then we'll go ahead. 

I tell my dad about how my girlfriend wasn't a very mormon girl when I met her, so much so that I didn't try to even hold her hand until the day of my 16th birthday despite it being quite obvious we liked eachother a lot. I then started having doubts, and when I confided in her she was very releived saying that she wasn't sure if she could have made herself beleive in the church.

After telling him these things, productive lives as a members of the church, and that a lot of what they teach about becoming a better person and service is something I beleive is good. But when my dad told me that I make him weep, all of that was gone. All I saw was a lifetime of indoctrination making my dad, one of the smartest people I know, blinded and intolerant. Nothing more than a puppet.

Later that night he wanted to talk to me some more, but another thing was said that cut me to my core. I told my dad about how I'm on track to receive a bachelors &amp; masters in electrical engineering in just 4 years, by age 21.

""Who cares?""

My education has always been very important to me, and he's sure of it as I've not been in the best of mood as late (no duh, you're telling me you'll never be happy for me on this path I've choosen).

This morning he confronted me again asking about why I never start conversations with him about the church. I tell him that I don't because it's awkard

He then leaves me with the words

I wonder if he's right, but is that enough?

Life is hard. Oh well.

1363534478.0,1agtiu,A small challenge.  It's time to move past linguistic manipulation.,curious_mormon,151,19,57,"Most of us are aware of the loaded the language, recognition is the first step to regaining control. 

----

**The dangling initial** 
----

This is most often the middle initial, length of importance, and developed sense of authority.  It presents the business look the corporation is going for.   Instead, I recommend we **drop the title and initial**.  Use the full name as applicable.  Compare President Thomas S. Monson with Tommy [self described], Thomas, or Thomas Monson.  Remove the deference in language and you remove a large portion of the emotional manipulation.

----

**The nonsensical titles**
----

Elder.  Since when is an 18 year old boy ""an Elder"".  It's an arbitrary title that implies a sense of authority or experience.  Neither of which is really true.  Missionaries as a whole are the most restricted class in the entire LDS church.   The nonsensical titles also apply to the supposed Prophet, or the title of apostle for the next 560 partners [8 x 70].   Yet, even they are not above the correlation committee (see Boyd Packer's recent recant and the Poleman back-peddle of the 80's) or newsroom (rewriting talks for at least the last 20 years).   See also ""president"" of various organizations, especially among women.  The relief society ""president"" is still completely non-autonomous.  *All* actions and talks are approved by the men above her.  Try calling missionaries by their first name, if known.  Some won't tell you for this exact reason.  Otherwise, **drop the meaningless titles**.  Refer to the point above for leveling the field of communication. 

----

**THE Church**  
----

The LDS like to think that they are the only religion

----

**Apostates
----

It's a running joke to refer to ourselves as apostates.  I'll admit, I recommend that we **use a description rather than a term**.  Say that you do not believe in certain parts of the dogma or the authority of the leaders.  Yes, it takes longer to get the information across; however, you'll do so without completely severing the lines of communication with believing members. 

----

**Assignment or calling**  
----

I propose that we stop using the word ""calling"" entirely.  God didn't ask you to clean the church.  God didn't ask you to give a talk.  God didn't ask you to teach a class no one wanted to attend.  God didn't ask you to make peanut butter.  God didn't ask you clean the multi-billion dollar mall while answering questions about the religion that owns it.  **You were given an assignment

----

**Request or invitation** 
----

To invite is a sign of friendship.  An extension of a favor, it's also used to manipulate the response.  How often do you hear the phrase, ""I want [God wants] to invite you to...[return to church, give a prayer, accept a calling, clean the church, help so and so move, you're being supplicated.  Despite the language

----

**Emotion or Spirit or [heartsell](http://www.bonneville.com/?nid=32)**
----

This brings me to the next point.  Emotional Manipulation.  To quote [Bonneville Communication](http://www.bonneville.com/?nid=32), then thought and, finally, action. We call this uniquely powerful brand of creative ""HeartSell""® - strategic emotional advertising that stimulates response."" The emotional videos were strategically crafted.  It's not ""touching"". It's not ""bringing in the spirit"". Let's call it what it is.  **It's emotional manipulation**.  

----

**Is nonbelief a sin**
----

You're in this forum

----

Of course watch your language around active LDS members, or may fully understand your intent.  The latter will likely result in an emotional reaction or shut-down.  It varies by person.  I also understand this is difficult.  I've been actively trying to remove the loaded terminology from my language for years with varying degrees of success.  It's just baked in there for too long. 

Now the open question

I saw a post a few days ago about how the church's view on women and mothers affected us girlies and well have been a little upset ever sense so I decided to post this mostly to get it off my chest. 


A few days after my 13th birthday I went through the delightfully embarrassing experience of my first period. Now naturally I didn't fully understand what was happening. Every month or so I got a stomach ache so bad I couldn't walk. This was some serious pain. I was missing at least one day of school if not more each month. My mom finally put the missed school days and my period together. She figured out that it wasn't stomach aches it was PMS and thought I was faking the severity. She mad me go to school even though I was balling from the pain. To be fair to my mom if any of her four children was going to fake being sick and even cry to make it believable it would have been me. I hated Jr High. I collapsed on the way to second period. There I am in the hall crumpled in a ball unable to get up, he didn't look at me at all, that he suspected a ""reproductive issue"". 

Doctor after clinic after specialist after hospital. 

It was March and the really nice female doctor tells me that I have virtually no chance of having a baby. EVER. 

I went to church a few weeks later. I don't remember what the official beehive class lesson was on but I do remember the teacher wrote ""men"" and ""women"" on the chalk board with a vertical line between them. She asked us what men got that women didn't. Being the smart little cookie that I am I raised my hand and said ""the priesthood"" she wrote it on the board. Then asked what women got that men don't. Long pause. Finally the girl in the class that hated me said ""we get to be moms"" why did it have to be her that brought it up. She didn't know about my issue

No one noticed my tears. Would they have if I was one of the ""cool girls"" instead of the one they mocked? Then the teacher then said ""Motherhood is the greatest gift in the world

I had nothing. 

I would never have anything. 

I was pointless. 

I ran from the room. Down the stairs, one of them could have gone looking for me and the other girls would still have been supervised. They had no idea where I was!) 

After spending some time in the nursery I felt a little better. After church I told my mom what happened. She said she would tell me leaders about my issue. I then spent 4 years and 3 months in hell. Every time motherhood or children came up in the lesson the teacher would not make eye contact with me at all. It was so obvious that one of the other girls mentioned it to me once. At the end of the lesson they would throw in a ""if for some reason the Lord does not see fit to bless you with children you should pray to know what his plans for you are instead"" WTF it didn't occur to me that GOD was depriving me of something until my leaders brought it up.

At no point was adoption ever mentioned. 

In high school I had a hard time dating because well..... what was the point. I turned down a second date with one of the coolest guys in school because I didn't want to end up being an un-fertile burden to  him. I kind of wonder even now as an adult what would have happened between us if I has said yes to that second date....

In college I went inactive. The pressure to get married and have kids was just to much. I even told my bishop

I started dating this guy. He was great. We stated sleeping together. No protection cause I cant have a baby right? So I ended up pregers. Went back to my doctor back home. Turns out that when she told 13 year old me that I couldn't have babies what she meant was I could get pregnant but I would just have a VERY VERY hard time staying pregnant. I lost the boyfriend. I hadn't yet told him I was pregnant. I lost the baby. The baby I have always wanted. He would have made a great dad. I would have made an amazing mom. 

I have been asked why I don't have kids so many times its ridiculous. Apparently I am very nurturing and motherly. What ever that means. 

I have had 3 other doctor confirmed miscarriages and one that lived long enough that they called it a stillborn. I don't even know how many times I was way late when I finally had my period. Some of those were probably miscarriages. 

So here I am 31. I still want to have a baby. I still can't. I have looked into adoption but I am not in a position financially for that to be fezable. Which I guess means that realistically I am not in a position financially to have a baby at all. Some days the pain of what I will never have is so sharp its just shy of unbearable. Other days I don't even think about it. But I have sense realized that I am not worthless

Hello again, and near in tears. My last post was about preparing for a discussion with my brother and father prior to flying down to visit them back last month. While I didn't have a full blown theological and philosophical discussion with either of them, we did have a few exchanges of thoughts which has bloomed into ongoing conversation over the course of the last month. Whatever bits of information I managed to provide apparently stuck with both my brother and father as they continue to come to me for clarification on their thoughts and for more information.

Anyways, unwavering TBM I have ever known in my life. I've never known her to question anything and everything she does is driven by prayer. I had a lengthy phone conversation with her this afternoon which somehow went into my defection from the church. She asked me what it was that caused me to go from outwardly TBM to apostate and so seemingly quickly.

I immediately remembered a comment she made shortly after I told her I left the church; ""You left so you could live a life of sin"" were her words

As we continued to speak she did something unthinkable. She asked for a few details on the issues in hopes that maybe she could provide an answer. Just prior to this

I mentioned to her that the BoA papyrus has been studied by Egyptologists, if not 100%, erroneously translated. I also mentioned the Kinderhook plates, and various unknowns about Joseph Smith's polyandry and the concerning details surrounding that topic. While she was well aware of the polygamy aspect, she had no idea how far the rabbit hole truly went in regards to his polyandry and even the underaged girls who he married. 

Her initial reaction was what I expected; ""I just don't believe any of that. There's no way any of that can be true"". I calmly explained to her that these issues are recognized by the church and even quoted a few passages and statements from GA's and Prophets through the years. I explained to her that her reaction is almost exactly identical to mine when I stumbled on these things; ""No, deep down inside, that what I was saying was untrue. Then I made a comment that I've seen stated throughout this subreddit a number of times, ""If the church isn't true, wouldn't you want to know?"". My mom, at this point, broke down. It was absolutely heart breaking but after a few minutes, and I'll paraphrase as best I can

Never in my life would I have ever thought my mom would step back from her beliefs, I would graciously accept. The simple fact that I've planted any sort of seed with her has me in a state of shock. 

I want to finish by saying that the progress I've made and the recent progress I've made with my family would never have been possible without you guys. I'm overjoyed and filled with hope that,,False,self,t5_2r0gj,False,,True

Jane Elizabeth Manning James -Pioneer convert, wants to be sealed to her black husband (who has the priesthood) - petitioned several times to take part in the temple - **denied**.  Keep in mind, she believes that she cannot be saved in the highest glory without temple ordinances.  

She tries a different approach.  Maybe the first presidency would consider adopting her into Joseph's family

Then the first presidency decides to grace her with another option so she can get into the celestial kingdom:  *She can be sealed to Joseph Smith as an eternal slave.*  She desperately accepts

The church she has given her life to, has sealed her as an eternal slave, not even allowing her in the temple to complete the ordinance herself.  

I don't care if this is the culture of the time, to think you are going to be saved, but not really, you'll have the honor of being a slave to someone for eternity, that's all you are good for, that's all God is offering you - this is reprehensible.  I cannot fathom any group that would be this heartless to another individual.  

Then enter 1978, a God like all the other mormons.  Unfortunately, you already consented to be an eternal slave to Joseph, and that's eternal.  Born at the wrong time I guess..     ",,False,self,False,t3_1k9z8s

I have read a number of unconfirmed reports of new temples significantly increasing the amount of tithing raked in for the area. The theory makes sense to me, pay tithing essentially for the opportunity to attend the temple weddings of their children and relatives. Without a nearby temple, those weddings would often be done at the chapel instead.

Since it's impossible to actually look at church finances, temples, and GDP per capita in each of the highest Mormonly-populated countries in the world (74 total).

[This is it sorted by total members](http://i.imgur.com/tx32C.jpg).  Meh

[This is it sorted by number of temples](http://i.imgur.com/5JTSj.jpg).  Now we're getting somewhere!  

[So let's sort by total potential tithing](http://i.imgur.com/1ovIE.jpg).  This is calculated assuming 100% activity

See some interesting things?  How about we change the Temples count to Temples + Announced/Under construction? [Here is that one](http://i.imgur.com/BPqvP.jpg).

Finally, with the new Temple Total](http://i.imgur.com/gRX28.jpg).

So we see poor Nicaragua down there with 71, including 4 in Utah.  I wonder why...

Denmark and Finland have fewer than 5, Sweden and the Netherlands are below 10,000 members each, but they each get temples.  Meanwhile, 12 countries with over 10,000 members don't have any temples.  Each of them has a far lower GDP per capita than Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands.

If anyone is wondering why Belgium doesn't have a temple,549 members (more than 3 times as many as Belgium) to the nearest temple.

You have to hand it to the Mormons

**tl;dr** Mormons don't build temples where members are. They build temples where they can get the most tithing out of members.

This has not been an easy thing for me to do to make the decision to leave.  Maybe that's not quite accurate.  The decision to leave was not hard

All through growing up in the Church, and how a person's skin would change based on their righteousness.  I never worried about it too much though because those were not part of the core beliefs - Jesus Christ/Atonement and Joseph Smith/Book of Mormon.  As long as those things were true nothing else really mattered.  Other things came up over time.  One thing that really bothered me was something I found on my own in the scriptures.  Moroni 7:45-46 was too similar to 1 Corinthians 13:4-8.  I could understand Old Testament scripture being in the BoM, but this was from Paul after the ministry of Christ.  It really bothered me, but I resorted to my usual tactic of putting it on a shelf and not worrying about it, because surely the important things were still true.  I did all the usual orthodox Mormon things and was never inactive for more than three weeks (which brought much guilt).  I always wanted the Church to be true and I honestly believed it a lot of the time.  It bothered me when people would get up and say that they *know* the Church is true, and I felt uncomfortable sharing my testimony because I couldn't truthfully say that, and what would people think if I said that I *believed* it to be true but didn't know.  I had a terrible time on my mission

So about a week ago I was casually browsing Reddit and I came across a post about the cloaked ship in Star Trek IV, so I typed it into the Reddit search and *this* was the top result.  I was curious about the exit stories and ended up reading every one of them.  Somewhere there was a link to mormonthink.com and that's when everything came apart for me really fast.  I read almost the entire site over the next three days (in secret with private browsing on).  I preferred reading it to playing Starcraft (I am reminded of the story of Parley P. Pratt about his discovering of the Book of Mormon).  It was the first time I had ever even considered that the Church might not be true, and all the concerns and doubts I had over the years made so much more sense if none of it was true to begin with.  I knew right then that there was no going back, I no longer believed it, and I had to get out of it just to be honest to myself.  I told my wife two nights ago and she took it better than expected.  After sitting down and saying I needed to talk and that I hadn't ever discussed this with anybody else, she thought I was going to say that I was gay, and was actually relieved when I told her.  She still believes, and there have been tears from both of us.  I'm still trying to figure out where to go from here with our marriage

My current situation of serving in a calling with my parents makes it a little difficult to avoid telling them what is going on.  They grew up hearing of all the hardships their great grandparents went through in crossing the plains and how faithful they were and one of my ancestors designed the roof of the tabernacle.  My mom is an avid Church history student, I am leaving because I no longer believe that it is true and in fact believe that Joseph Smith was an expert con artist.  That's difficult for me to even type.  So I welcome words of encouragement as I get ready to make this declaration tonight.  If you have any advice on how to approach my bishop (who is someone that watched me grow up in the Church), that would be great too.  I'm also a little worried about what my family will think of me, but I have never felt like I was standing more for what I believe than I do right now.

Well you probably all know about [D&amp;C 130:14-15](http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130?lang=eng) given in Feb. 14

But the story actually involves a man by the name of [William Miller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Miller_(preacher)) whose views were the founding of the Seventh Day Adventist church

Joseph Smith believed that William Miller's predicted day of advent was set for April 3, Joseph recorded that Christ would not come until December 23, 1890 which became D&amp;C 130.

Now

Problem is, but tis too pleasent for false prophets.""

Later (April 5th) Joseph reiterated the ""eighty-five years old"" prophecy and promised that, that the Son of Man will not come in the heavens till I am 85 years old, 48 years hence or about 1890."" in his own journal

http://www.boap.org/LDS/Parallel/1843/6Apr43(2).html

This is not 3rd hand.  This is not the poorly edited Church history or bad scribes.  This is Joseph, and many of the church members would see it.  

Further, and Christ would come and the government would be thrown down.  They really believed the last days were in THAT GENERATION, with many many quotes to back this claim up.  So when 1890 arrived and Christ did not, the poor church was dumb founded how to continue.

This explains church debt (Suckers, the running to Deseret and building up until 1890, etc. etc.  The world view that 1890 was the final year is so similar to so many other religions/cults that declare an end date and then have to continue after it arrives and the world continues turning that for ""anti-mormons"" to declare Joseph wrong is in no way more or less wrong that the ""anti-miller"" Joseph Smith boasting that Miller was wrong the day after.

So who said that ""People of this generation"" would see the savior?  That's right, because it's pretty cut and dry that Joseph was directly wrong on what God told him.  And it continues to be wrong for every generation it is told to.",,False,self,t5_2r0gj,False,,

- All men must be tempted by Satan

-----

Let's explain the Plan of Salvation as it is currently taught

- Jesus comes to Earth, establishes the priesthood, and appoints leaders

- Jesus suffers for the sins of mankind

- Jesus leaves the management of his church to his appointed leaders

- The Great Apostasy

- The Restoration

- Second coming

- Start of Millennium

- Satan is bound

- Lime Jell-O with carrots

- End of Millennium

- Satan is unbound so that all mankind can be tempted

- Final Battle

-----

Hold the phone. SATAN is part of the plan. It is NECESSARY for Satan to tempt every person.

Without being tempted by Satan

Here is where we run into a MAJOR contradiction.

We have to find it back in the Pre-Mortal Existence.

-----

Pre-Mortal Existence:

- God and Wife/Wives are celestial beings

- We are all spirit children

- God solicits his spirit children for a plan to become Gods like him

- Jehovah [Jesus] presents a plan

- Lucifer [Satan] presents a plan

- Jehovah's plan is chosen

- Lucifer revolts

- Lucifer and his followers are cast out of heaven and become Satan and his devils.

-----

Did you catch it?

Jehovah presented a plan, the Devil himself, to tempt all of us. It is a requirement before we can be judged and go to heaven.

When Jehovah presented his plan, then he's a fucking asshole, and so is his dad for going along with it, as well as the other 2/3 of the host of heaven.

If that wasn't part of Jehovah's plan, with God drowning the whole world because they didn't do what he wanted them to do.

On Monday my Dad invited a new member of the ward to come eat dinner with us and the Elders.
Let's call the new member Jim. Jim just moved here from Nigeria. He is in his late 20's

Jim had already set my creepy radar off. He was overly friendly. I chalked it up to culture though. When we picked him up on Monday
We got home and my dad went outside to feed the horses and take care of a few things while I set the table and Jim sat in our living room.
Jim was chatty. He kept asking me questions about my life and also my friend who was going on a mission. Then the following conversation ensued:

Jim: Are you going on a mission?
Me: Haha
Jim: Well why not?
Me: It's not for me.
Jim: Have you prayed about it?
Me: No. 
Jim: That should've been first. It's God's decision really.

I'd been avoiding the inevitable ""I'm not a member"" conversation. Most, and they go on with life. Mutual respect. (Probably why I don't have a disdain for the church.)

Me: I'm not a member
Jim: You're kidding.
Me: Haha
Jim: You don't joke about things like that.
Me: I'm not kidding.
Jim: Stop that. I don't believe you.
Me: You don't have to.
Jim: Why are you not a member?
Me: I don't want to talk about it.
Jim: Why not?
Me: It's personal.
Jim: That's selfish.
Me: That's fine.
Jim: Share with me!
Me: No.
Jim: I'll wait.
Me: Go ahead. I don't feel comfortable talking about it.
Jim: Please?
Me: Please stop.

By now, as long as they are respectful. Which most of the time they are. Probably because all of the tricks had been pulled on me. Now they just have to ""Sit and wait"".

Jim: How come you did not join as a child?
Me: My mom raised me to hate the church. I discovered her hateful ways. I moved in with my dad. I attended the church. By then I was old enough to make my own decisions. 

I chose to ""Explore it"". I didn't want to crush my dad's heart. He didn't bother me about it

Jim: Well have you prayed about it?
Me: (Fuck you.) Jim
Jim: I'm glkad you've read the Book of Mormon. Here's my testimony.

The next 15 minutes I'm stuck politely nodding my head at this asshole's testimony. I've heard the same recycled crap. I just want him to stop. Finally my dad comes in.

Jim: Have you ever been moved emotionally by something?
Me: Yes.
Jim: In sacarament?
Me: Yes.
Jim: Do you believe that is the spirit?
Me: I don't want to talk about this topic.
Jim: You are scared of the Spirit.
**Dad:** (Puts hand on my shoulder) C_Eberhard has done very good things. I'm very proud of her. (I walk off.) She has earned her young women's medallion. She has served in the church unofficially. She is doing well in college. She serves multiple communities. She does it with a smile. She's had a hard beginning. She's not scared. She's strong. (Yay daddy!)

Jim finally stopped let up. (After I relentlessly tried to get him to stop.) The Elders showed up. We had dinner. Jim talked THE ENTIRE TIME! All about his mission. A mission he had 5 years ago. I swear he told us every detail. And when it came to a conversion story, Jim.) Even the Elders looked annoyed. It was P-day. When they come over for dinner usually, my family doesn't talk abotu the church until the ending lesson. My dad, never one to make someone too unhappy, nodded and seemed interested the entire time, but he was annoyed.

I left the dinner table when we were done to go outside with the dogs. I came back in to make ICe Cream for the Elders, the Elders told me they couldn't get a word in edge-wise). Jim talked until he checked his watch and asked to be brought home. Before he left he wanted a hug from me. I leaned into him. My dad told me to give him a real hug. I immediately showered.

1367986186.0,1dwuxi,"An open letter to Mormons who want to intervene with someone who has ""lost their testimony""",bc_pg,129,15,28,"Dear Mormon

You have a friend, you may feel guilt that had you been a better parent, friend, etc. that they would not have gotten to this point. You think that if you can save just their one soul, how great will be your eternal joy with them. You feel compelled and maybe even prompted to reach out in love in attempt to rescue them.

To you I write this open letter. Please review this before proceeding.

First: Don’t do it.

A) You don’t have anything to say that they have not already heard. At a young age every Mormon has learned that those who lose their testimony do so because they were offended, loneliness, failure, and loss of purpose. They have been exhorted countless times to read the scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon and to sincerely pray to receive a testimony of the truth. They know that doctrine states that apostatizing from the church has serious eternal consequences – possibly even Outer Darkness.

B) Every person who has decided they do not believe has already seriously considered all of the points listed above. They have thought about them and through them many times. The Mormon teachings and culture ensure that all members are very aware of these. They did not come to their decision lightly.

C) You are very

D) The 11th Article of Faith states: “…and we allow all men the same privilege, or what they may.” This would be an excellent time to heed this scripture.

E) You are probably aware that the Mormon Church has a reputation among some of being a cult. One of the major characteristics of a cult is the intense pressure they place on defectors. Don’t contribute to this reputation by behaving in a manner consistent with cults.

F) Remember the saying: “Fools step in where angels fear to tread.”

OK you aren’t willing to listen to this advice to not do it, etc.

Remember the Golden Rule: “Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.”

Let’s take a scenario that will aid us in following the Golden Rule. Imagine you have grown up Baptist and have decided that you believe in Mormonism instead.

You know that the Baptist variation you believed teaches that Mormons are going to Hell because they accept the wrong concept of Jesus. You did not make this decision lightly – it was a difficult painstaking decision that took much soul searching. However

You receive the following letter:

Dear You:

I love you very much and write this in the spirit of love. I was very concerned to hear that you are leaving the Baptist faith and joining the Mormon Church. I am very worried about you and you are in the grasp of Satan – I exhort you to repent of your backsliding and return to the true Christ. The path you are on will only lead to sadness and emptiness in your life. Please read the true Bible which holds the truth of the gospel and return to the light. I feel the needs to warn you of this - you are rejecting Jesus and will burn eternally in Hell. I have taught you the way to happiness and the truth your whole life

Love

Loved one.

Now let’s take a look at how you would react to this letter.

Likely:

A) You would feel very disrespected and hurt. Despite the words “love” being used many times

B) This would do nothing to make you desire to return to the Baptist church. Since you no longer believe it is true

Instead consider:

Dear You:

I understand that you are leaving the Baptist faith and joining the Mormon Church. I want you to know that even though we now have different beliefs it changes nothing in that I still love and accept you. I promise to continue to treat you the same and to not let this new difference come between us – you and our relationship is what is most important to me.

I recognize that this must have been a very difficult decision and you would not have taken it lightly. In fact, but I am happy to listen to and understand your viewpoint. I recognize that this is probably a difficult time of transition for you and many are probably questioning everything about you. I just want you to know that even though I may disagree with your new beliefs, I am here to support and love you.

Love
Loved one.

Now how would you react to this letter?

So if you are going to intervene

Don’t:
- Preach – they already know.
- Say directly or indirectly that they are in Satan’s grasp.
- Make accusations of sinfulness, etc.
- Take the black and white approach that your beliefs are right and theirs are wrong - that you have the moral high ground and they have the moral low ground.
- Imply that their beliefs lead only to sadness
- Exhort them to read the Book of Mormon and pray about it.
- Attack their new belief system.

Do:
- Allow them agency to choose their beliefs. Do not consider them a project
- Put your relationship with them and your acceptance of them as a person above your difference in belief. Provide support in a challenging time of transition for them.
- Recognize that they did not make this decision lightly. They already know that they are doomed if they are wrong. They are so convinced that is not the case that they are moving forward with it.
- Recognize that they have already heard and experienced the same things you have as a Mormon. Respect that they have reasons that are valid to them that overshadow those experiences.
- If you a brave enough

1366065197.0,1cf4yt,Currently Serving A Mission. Wanting to Leave the Church...Not Sure How.,MoMissionarySC,129,16,70,"I'm a 21 year old missionary for the LDS Church. I am currently serving a mission in the mid-west. Where-abouts I can't really be specific because several of my companions peruse reddit as well. However I can give you a little background.

My intention with this post is to receive some serious advice on where to go from here.

I was born and raised in the church but was less active between the age of 17-20. At this time I lived away from home

In essence I honestly thought that my life shaping up while giving up booze/drugs was directly linked with my faithfulness to the LDS church. Add to this all of the wonderful guilt tactics of the church and years of indoctrination and you get one messed up situation.

Anyways I continued to stay faithful. Blundered through my Temple day. Surprise surprise as I progressed more through the church I actually relapsed and was extremely hungover that day. Hmmm wonder why the ""spirit"" didn't tell the temple workers that. Oh well.

As I went down that slippery slope of re-activity I did end up turning back to old vices to deal with the depression and my own self-loathing for pretending to believe in something I didn't. The hypocrisy didn't stop there though and I ended up putting my papers in and beginning my mission last year. Culturally it was the thing to do. And I heard so much about how your mission really defines a person. So I carried on.

While on my mission you learn even more about the church. Especially when you throw yourself at it day in day out and for a few months I was pretty happy. And then I started to question doctrines and church history and got into some pretty heated arguments with other missionaries. I then used my handy local library to do some more in-depth research and have come to my own conclusions that I don't want to be apart of this broken institution and it's deceit and lies. It's killing me to represent this church day in day out and not having an outlet to speak about my actual beliefs. 

That brings me to you guys. To get your opinion on what I should do. I don't want to sever ties with my Family. They've been through this process before and killed them emotionally

The biggest problem I have is losing so many of my friends. I gave up a lot of my dead beat alcoholic friends and traded them for the Mormon Community. Now I'm tasked with starting over again. Thankfully hindsight is 20/20 and I will be finding better people to place my friendship in. 

Basically I need help on what to do from here. Where can I go till I am financially stable? How do I approach my family the 2nd time to tell them I'm leaving the church for good? How do I get out of this mission? 

-EDIT-

I'll be back tomorrow to respond to posts library here closes in 10 minutes.

-EDIT2-
Thank you for the support everyone. I about died when I saw how many people were volunteering to let me stay at their place. So I have a plan of action now. I'll be contacting the President soon with my intentions and returning home to continue my education.  All in all it has been a nerve racking experience. I hardly slept last night but I agree with the comments here. I think I'm letting my fear get the best of me. 

As far as substance abuse problems go I am definitely seeking out help to tackle those problems. I haven't had them the entire time on my mission due to lack of access and I am going to overcome them when I get home even with access.

Again thank you so much for all of your support. It's very amazing to know that there is support systems outside of the church. Something that sounds inherent I know but hard to realize when you never knew anything else growing up.

**It feels like you will never leave school**

Whether you're 12 or 20

1) Learn to do your homework first

I know this sucks, this was the most useful thing I learned in school.  Get the job done, then play, helped me survive college, and land that first Salary job.  It let's me take care of kids and a family.  

If you can't manage this, and then do the work seems key to these people.  They take clients out on huge expense accounts as work.  It's not bad if you can get it.

2) If you don't fit in

School is built around the idea that children need to work in factories.  I'm serious.  The original public school system was built around the concept of industrialization.  So if you're naturally an artist, etc. odds are you're going to struggle in the public system.   

3) Survive.

Do it, I know there are down days.  They'd happen even if your life was perfect, just due to hormones.  Get to the 21 range, and learn how much more there is to life.

I'd highly recommend taking enough of a martial art that you can defend yourself from jerks.  Most will leave you alone after you don't back down once.  Word spreads quickly and you may have to have a fight.

I know, Joseph fought.  Brigham took on the whole USA.  The current church is run by sniveling cowards who won't stand up to challenges when people depend on them.  Try to steer confrontation to where it will hurt you least.

When I was in Jr. High, and he was never challenged again.

4) Get a support group.  If you don't have one, and man, you'll have a group of people who will help when you need it in no time.

**Sex**

I'm not going to dwell on this

DON'T FUCK FUTURE YOU UP.

That's it.  Pregnancy and STD's can really screw up this area for future you.  Be careful

**Lifecycle**

There is a tradition in the Hopi Indian tribe that discusses the 4 stages of life as ""Mouse"", ""eagle"".  I'm going to use this analogy because I think it works well.

1) Mouse- The mouse must be cared for.  It is the infant/small child who is dependent on others for survival.  You've just emerged from this stage of life

This rebellion is a natural process and part of the cycle.  And to have any credibility that it's not just rebellion you need to act more mature than your years.  You have to leave ""Mouse"" and that is why we say ""Get a job

2) Bear- To the bear, and if I can't fuck, I die.  Kill or be killed.  It's the rage of the hormones and the drive.

The thing is, fight, kill, sexy dresses, sexy parties, live like we're gonna die young.  

But really this is a very limited time in your lives.  Do enjoy it.  Create memories that will last when you look back.  But don't dwell on it for the rest of your lives.

Do realize that between classes and homework, even though it doesn't feel like it.

3) Bison-  The bison's job is to provide for everyone around him.  This stage is coming whether you like it or not.  Provide for the children.  Provide for aging parents.  Spend your time on internet forums providing for the needs of others.  Provide for the kid down the street who's parent is not providing.

You'll WANT to do this.  To provide for everyone.  It's in our nature.  So don't burn out your life in Mouse and bear stages.  Get to where you can provide

Once you reach a stage where you are providing for people adequately

The office politics will get boring

You start to realize you are going to be gone

4) Eagle- The eagle is the one with vision far beyond the others.  He/She has experienced life and wants to share.  Kinda like making endless talks ""To the youth of the church"".  You want to impart that wisdom.  War stories.  Unsolicited advice.  You want to smooth the road for those who are still traveling down it.

5) Back to Mouse- Bad teeth, pains, wrinkles, dementia.  We all head towards this on our road and you need to admit it.  One day, if you live long enough, you will be dependent on people around you to take care of you.  Build up friendships and relationships so that you can receive this care.

**broad terms**

This is a broad brush to paint with, and some foresight.

We too, had times where school stretched on forever.  And I want you to know that there's lots lots more to life.  It gets deeper and broader than anything you can imagine right now and it's worth getting to taste it all.

I lied about my pornography and masturbation problems for years until I was able to go on a mission. I did not want people to know about my problems because I thought I could fix it myself and I would've been extremely embarrassed if I did not go on a mission when I turned 19. This lying caused me great pain and I thought I was a terrible person. I thought I was just going to make it to the Telestial kingdom or if I was lucky I could go to the Terrestrial kingdom. 

On my mission I went without masturbating for about 9 months. That was my longest streak but I just couldn't help myself and I had to do it. Of course I felt really guilty for doing it and I did not want to do it again. I ended up doing it every couple of months after that and I couldn't stop. I couldn't tell my mission president because I didn't want to be sent home. So I was in the deep dark despair of a mission all by my sinning self.

I was dreading to go home in a way because I did not know if I would be strong enough to resist porn on the internet. Well I didn't go to the computer right away when I got home but I eventually went on when my family was out of the house. I did this for years while I was at school. Eventually

Eventually, working out, dates, and other things. I would try not to be home by myself so I wouldn't be tempted. I pretty much did everything that was suggested except I could not stop!

Then I found out that the church was full of lies and it was complete b***s***. After 3 years being out of the Mormon church I barely look at porn. I don’t think about it near as often. It’s not some evil thing that should not partake of. In a way porn has lost it’s edge because I don’t look at it as sinning anymore. It’s kind of to bad because porn was way better as a Mormon and it was a lot more exciting as a Mormon. Porn use to be something I thought about often and it would be my go to thing if I got stressed. Now I barely think of it and I have other ways to cope with stress.

f*** the Mormon church for making me feel like I was so evil and for making me feel I had an addiction problem for 14 years of my life. f*** them for interrogating me about it for 14 years. f*** them for making me think I would not make it to the top level of heaven.

My companion and I went to visit a local member who's non-member son had been visiting for a couple weeks. The son had left suddenly on business and due to the sudden nature of his business he had left a case of 24 long neck Corona beers in his father's (an active member) fridge.

The member told us his trash man wouldn't take the un-opened beer and asked us if we could take it and throw it in the dumpster at our apartment complex. My companion and I looked at one another

We drove home in silence. Each of us uncomfortable with the thought of 24 bottles of liquid sin hiding in the trunk of our well known missionary car in a small town. Eventually we got home and pulled into our parking lot

As I put the car in park the thought came to me that just because I don't drink beer didn't mean the beer necessarily had to be thrown away. Did it? I thought maybe it would be a beneficial thing to find someone that would actually appreciate the beer. It was 24 bottles after all

I ran the idea by my companion who's greenie (new missionary) face suddenly dropped into an uncomfortable frown. He was from Utah, economic focused, libertarian wasn't too long for the Mormon church ehh?

Well

One of the roommates answered the door. When she saw the two missionaries from across the hall standing in front of her door, she immediately assumed we were there to convert her. Her face went from smile to stern as I began to speak.

Me: ""Hi

Her: (Just nods slowly

Me: ""Do you drink beer?""

Her: (Surprised I have the balls to immediately begin attacking her life in such a direct manner and thinking that maybe I was deserving of a tongue lashing)

""Yes

Me: ""Great!"" 

Her: (confused look on face)

Me: ""Well

(I pull back the suit coat to display the case of beer

Her: ""You want to give me this beer?""

Me: ""Yep!"" (I then explained the situation and how it was better that someone that drank got to do what they liked doing then someone that didn't want to drink stopping them from doing so. It is a free country after

Well

I still chuckle to myself sometimes at the thought that maybe sometime in the future one of those roommates are going to be talking to missionaries again and when the missionaries tell about the Word of Wisdom (Mormon rule against drinking beer) they are going to have quite a story to tell).",self,t5_2r0gj,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/13gs80/two_missionaries_and_a_24_bottle_case_of_corona/

1340202602.0,vbv6k,Brief history of tithing and the financial stability of the LDS church. ,curious_mormon,127,14,52,"Here's an interesting view on the history of tithing and how it related to the wealth and financial success of the LDS church. 

* **1837** - Presiding bishop defined tithing as two percent
of one's net worth

* **1838** - D&amp;C 119 redefines tithing as all surplus property and then 1/10th of interest annually.

* **1844** - Official proclaimation for all saints to immediately pay a one time tithe of 1/10th of their property and money to the church.  Exemptions are not made for those who paid at conversion. - [source](http://lds-church-history.blogspot.com/2010/12/lds-history-summary.html)

* **1845** - The church emphasizes the need to pay 1/10th of all possessions when entering the ""new and everlasting covenant"". - [source](http://lds-church-history.blogspot.com/2010/12/lds-history-summary.html)

* **1846** - Apostle John Page

* **1851** - Brigham instigated a vote that would allow excommunication for members not paying tithing or following the word of wisdom. [source](http://lds-church-history.blogspot.com/2010/12/lds-history-summary.html).  This penalty was inconsistent and not often applied. 

* **1873** - Orson hide describes tithing as 1/10th all of your property at the start and 1/10th of your annual income thereafter.  This *appears* to be the first known instance of tithing being called 10% of your income.  - see edit2 for sources

* **1873**, Brigham young, see edit 2 for sources.

* **1874** Tithing is an inferior law compared to the Law of consecration.  - [Orson Pratt] - see edit2 for sources

* **1878** Even a widow who receives her full support from the church must pay tithing on those funds [L.W. Hardy - May 15

* **1879** Lorenzo Snow agrees with Hardy

* **1892** Joseph F Smith implies tithing comes before necessities and implicitly suggests that 9 dollars will go further than 10 when tithing is paid.  - see edit2 for the actual quote and sources

* **1896** - Salaries stopped for everyone but the 12 due to financial troubles. 

* **1898** - the LDS church is now $2.3 million (1800's $) in debt.  - [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finances_of_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints#History)

* **1899** - Lorenzo's snow stated that everyone must pay tithing prompting a dramatic increase in tithe payers.  This was about the same time he issued a total of $1 million in short term bonds.  - [source](http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?hideNav=1&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=023ba41f6cc20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&amp;vgnextoid=637e1b08f338c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD).  The manuals show this as [a turning point](http://www.lds.org/general-conference/1994/04/tithing?lang=eng) for the emphasis on tithing and it's connection with full membership.  - Also note the subtle retcon in the current manuals.  This is known as Lorenzo Snow's declaration on paying 10% of your income; yet, or 10% are not used in the original quote.  Instead, he simply says that each man is [""to do the will of the Lord and to pay his tithing in full.""](http://truthmarche.wordpress.com/).  10% of ""income"" had not been used prior to this time.

* **1899** - Joseph F Smith says tithing is a personal choice.  Pay more to be blessed more. - (Conference Report, president as of this year.

* **1953**, April 1953, p.97

* **1957** - The LDS church has a $7 million surplus from tithing funds. - despite this

* **1959** - The LDS church stops publishing its financial reports. [source](https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/102-17-29.pdf)

* **1962** - ""The Church was deficit-spending $32 million annually. New York financiers had to advise against the First Presidency's proposal ""to finance such spending by selling Church securities for the next fifty years.  The new year looked no better. By the end of February

* **Post 1970** quotes can be found by searching on LDS.org for tithing, or tithe.

* **1996** - Estimates place the LDS church's annual revenue at ~$5 billion with total assets between $25-$30 billion.  [time magazine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finances_of_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints#Assets)

* **Today**, and increase are often used interchangeably. 

**Conclusion**: Tithing changed through the years to pay for emergency financial needs; however

October 2010: The Sisters meet Pat, so curious and dedicated. She reads her scriptures eagerly and asks just the right amount of questions. A golden convert.

November 2010: The Sisters challenge Pat to baptism. Pat accepts. Pat is very excited to become a mormon. She has never felt so happy or at peace. Just one problem -- baptism is full immersion, because she cannot get water around the tubing for her kidney dialysis. The Sisters are sure the Lord will provide, so Pat tells her doctor what's going on. Her doctor tells her she should not get baptized. He recommends against it on a medical basis -- this would be very bad for Pat, and although he's happy that she's found friendship and spiritual peace in the LDS church, he says he must recommend against baptism, for Pat's health.

It's okay, they decided to write the Presidency or MTC in SLC? Perhaps they decided to consult with their Mission President? Their bishop? Perhaps they simply explained the teachings of baptisms for the dead to Pat, and promised they would personally baptize her by proxy when she passed?

No. No

December 2010: So weird, we even stopped by the nursing home! No Pat! 

Another letter comes, isn't that so sad? But Pat is so lucky to have the Lord on her side. Pat is so thankful to be a member of the church. The Lord gives us nothing that we cannot handle!

The ""funny"" thing about this story (if there is anything remotely funny about it) is that my kid sister honestly does not seem to connect the kidney dialysis/ doctor's warning/ saran-wrap &amp; duct tape baptism with Pat's subsequent infection and amputation. She is blithely and happily certain that Pat's soul is saved

* You are doing this (not us
* You are definitely going to become an alcoholic (not an exaggeration
* I wasn't going to say
* I am kicking you off the insurance in 5 days GL+HF!

The thing I noticed over and over again was how much *he blamed me* for what was going on. In previous emails, this particular Mormon prophecy has come true in that I am kicking him out of his life by the fact that he is kicking me out of his life. Again, his primary reason is that because I am willing to tell my ADULT FREAKIN SISTER if she ASKS me why I am leaving.

* In the last 3 years of college I've had 3 different college jobs. According to them
* I am abusive to my wife. The proof is that to escape from fights
* I hate my sister's kids and motherhood. The two reasons for this are 1) I said I was proud that my wife was going back to medical school (this is an insult against my sister who stays at home with kids) and 2) I do not think that my niece (or anyone) has a soul.

Why does she threaten to take away the one thing that keeps me sane because I don't want to go to church

I was listening to her and her friend talk the other day, and turned to professional help after the church screwed him over. She kept going on and on about how he was an abusive husband, even though he did everything he could to please my grandma, to make her happy. She kept saying that my grandma had no place to grieve for him, because he was going to rot in hell, just because he couldn't take the pain. He couldn't take the shame either, and fuck them for taking my grandfather away from me. He was the kindest man, and when he couldn't anymore, they dumped him on the floor

&gt;The First Presidency has taught that your purpose as a teacher of youth is to **help them become converted to the gospel** of Jesus Christ.

&gt;The path to conversion is a personal one. Conversion does not happen in a meeting, youth are converted by diligently living the gospel each day**—praying, studying the scriptures, **keeping the commandments**, fulfilling priesthood and other duties, attending the temple, serving their families and others, their desires

Hold the fucking phone.

Article of Faith #4 - We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.

The entire structure of the church is now: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; fourth, Repentance.

The church manual knows that the youth have already been baptized and confirmed

Repentance is when you change your behavior to be obedient to commandments. This is now the last thing that happens in the conversion process.

It's such a bait-and-switch - First you lock them in and keep reminding them that the are now fully accountable for any and all sins they commit for the rest of their lives. They are now life-long committed to obedience

Upon his conclusion, and uninspired. He described excessive tolerance being a vice and not a virtue, and that legalizing certain things doesn't change the violation of god's law of chastity. 

I titled this post out of sight out of mind because, a global church, then it should advocate for 'righteousness' on a global level, not on a local level. I immediately began thinking of other countries around the world, and wondered what their laws of the land were in regards to marriage equality. I wanted to focus on countries where the church currently has a presence. The first google link was titled ""11 countries where same-sex marriage is legal"". I wish more members would consider that they live in a much bigger world than the insignificant sliver they've carved out for themselves. 
It is so hypocritical to me to spend so much time and money oppressing others in California and the United States while ignoring the rest of the world. I don't see the church publicly denouncing the laws in Africa demanding prison time or death just for being gay. I don't see them lobbying in other countries to abolish laws that allow same sex marriage. If the laws of god are just that, if you're going to be apathetic to other countries' laws of the land.

If there's anything I've learned from leaving the church

- There are better ways to spend Sundays than in Mormon Church meetings.

- There is better underwear out there than the underwear Mormons are conditioned to wear. (This is especially true for women!)

- There's a better way to embrace spirituality than is possible in Mormonism. 

- There are better ways of spending that 10% of your income you give to the Mormon Church.

- There are better ways to talk about sex with your kids than Mormon teachings allow.

- There are better ways to get married than the closed and shallow temple sealing.

- There are better cures for illness than priesthood blessings.

- There are better health practices than the Word of Wisdom.

- There are better ways to pick which movies to see.

- There are better ways to raise girls into women than is possible in the Mormon Church.

- There are better ways to speak about non-believers than Mormonism practices.

- There are better ways to deal with diversity than Mormonism models.

- There are better family values than Mormonism teaches.

- There is more hope for the world than Mormonism gives.

- There are more inspirational books out there than Mormon scriptures and the Bible.

- There are better ways to make decisions than ""following the holy ghost.""

- There are better ways to help our communities than practiced in Mormonism.

- There is more wonder for life available outside of Mormonism.

- There are more ways to love your spouse after Mormonism.

- There are better things you can do than spend two years/eighteen months on an LDS mission.

- There are better ways to keep a family close together than within Mormonism.

- There are better speakers out there than you'll ever hear in General Conference.

- There is better information about life available outside of the church than in it.

- There's better things to do than attending repetitive Mormon masonic temple rites.

It's increasingly painfully obvious how much of this religion is an enormous cultural circlejerk interpreted as eternal truths
s which suddenly made them unquestionable DJs for God.

What's the doctrine? Oh, even if previous leaders have been wrong, and that even though all of them disagree on some level with some things and are subject to their own preconceived biases and opinions, it's all ""God's Word"". Didn't you know God was schizophrenic?

Caffeine? Yeah, it's not at all. I mean, yes, Joseph Smith drank wine and tea, and the vast majority of the Word of Wisdom is really just a guideline left up to interpretation, but we're still going to hardline you on our interpretation of just a few of its verses, anyway. And yes, but then God suddenly revealed they were okay after all, but that was only in the 80s when President Benson said that, though if they go above that we're going to have to Photoshop it out. Those angels and little girls in those pictures just looked too gosh darn sexual!

And sure, and condemn them a few decades ago, but now God has decided they're just ""misguided"" (though still morally inferior). And sure, in the future we're going to decide to fully accept them once general culture no longer accepts our bigotry, but just be comfortable knowing you can still look down on them for now. Sure, Mark E. Petersen once said interracial marriage was the greatest threat facing society, but don't worry about that; he was only slightly wrong! It's actually homosexual marriage. You can trust us on that, because of all the objective evidence showing how homosexuals are ruining society.

No, just trust us. It's there.

See, but when they're right they are speaking for God. Oh, how do you know the difference? It's easy: see, if something they said later reflects poorly on them or us, they were speaking as a man, but otherwise they were speaking for God. We're professional retconners for God, after all.

It's all ""truth"", just don't worry about it or question us. It'll be easier that way.

Hello!

A group of individuals (unincorporated) have collected enough personal funds to put up a billboard along the 600 S. Exit from I-80.

It is an advertisement for the MormonThink website. They have tried going through Reagan Outdoor as the billboard company.

They were denied on the premise that the billboard is ""too offensive.""

The billboard design contains no offensive or hateful verbiage

I remember a similar situation back around 2006 when Jeff Ricks from PostMormon.org had trouble with Reagan

What are the legalities concerning matters like this?

Thank you for your time

This weekend had a few watershed moments for her/us. I think she's already made up her mind about the church; she just hasn't reached that point where she can pull the trigger, she's getting there:
 
* About once every 3 months, eat somewhere that doesn't have pictures of the food on the menu, and basically just be alone together.  We did that this weekend, and I brought a cooler of alcoholic beverages for me to enjoy. I like craft beers, and typically grab 6 different singles from the liquor store at a time.  I decided to change things up a bit this time, and grabbed 3 different flavors of Mike's Hard Lemonade in addition to 3 beers.  I went straight to the hotel after work, and waited for my wife to drop the kids off and join me.  When she got to the hotel room, and asked with a smile if I'd bought the sweet drinks to tempt her. I had not, and said ""Let's have drunk sex tonight"". I almost climaxed right then.  She drank all 3 Mike's in less than 2 hours (she's 115 lbs., as fun as the drunk sex was
 
* My garments have been in a trash bag in the back of the closet for over a year. She unceremoniously tossed them out on Saturday after we got back from the hotel; just like you would any other pair of worn out clothing.
 
* She teaches Young Women's twice a month.  Usually, and finally decided to have the girls teach themselves. She gave them pictures of Joseph's life, and had them spend 10 minutes researching the stories behind them, and then presented them to the class.  Good enough for now, she said.  Well, the only thing we talked about when she got home from church until after dinner was what the historical record says vs. what the correlated version says.  Peep stone vs. Urim and Thumim, the ""testimonies"" of the men who say they ""saw"" the golden plates, secret polygamy...She was very attentive, and hearing how much crap Emma had to deal with
 
* My mother-in-law is in a stressful marriage.  She frequently comes over to our house to vent, these visits are intrusive, but usually they are not a problem.  A few weeks ago she watched the kids while my wife and I went on a date, and she hung around to talk after we got home around 10 PM.  As my MIL is venting about her latest frustration, my wife blurts out, ""Mom! I finally get it.  You need to take a break from the church. So much of your stress and unhappiness comes from your attempts to make yourself fit into the mold the church tells you to fit into. You should take a break."" This led us into a great conversation about my reasons for leaving, and my wife's reasons for doubting yet staying (for now).  This is a conversation I would love to have with my own parents, it was 2 AM before she left.  The following morning she text me saying, got scared and stopped thinking about it.  Oh well, she came over and basically says

* He is **actively trying to strip you of your identity**.  He praises those who emulates him.  He gives you a new name.  He forces conformity in act and thought.  He mandates clothing choices.

I then went on to explain that the born-again point of view is that Jesus gives the priesthood to his followers so both men and women can give blessings in their church, but they still believe that only men can be leaders, and that is why there are no women pastors or preachers in their church.

Of course one of the big changes happened when the church purchased [main street plaza](http://www.acluutah.org/mainstreetplaza.htm) to prevent protestors.  Now if only they had said they were buying it for ""Downtown renovation""

Rounding the corner one, groves and fish ponds” (Deseret News Weekly, 30 Apr. 1853, 46 stated by Brigham Young about temples).  Now those little ""..."" ellipses have nailed me before so let's get the whole quote:

""This I do know-there should be a temple built here. I do know it is the duty of this people to commence to build a temple. Now, until it is done, and put forth your hands willingly to finish it. I know what it will be. I scarcely ever say much about revelations, or visions, but suffice it to say, five years ago last July I was here, and saw in the spirit the temple not ten feet from where we have laid the chief cornerstone. I have not inquired what kind of a temple we should build. Why? Because it was represented before me. I have never looked upon that ground, however, and Joseph only built one. It is easier for us to build sixteen, on the top

Ah, by having trees and a waterfall.  Fulfilling prophesy in the only way that the LDS god can, I guess.

Moving on down past the rotating homeless people with cardboard signs

**Stop 1**

The first stop is outside the SLC temple itself.  They do not tell you about the [masonic handshake](http://lifeafter.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/temple-symbols-12.jpg) above the window on the first floor

Nor will they mention the [all seeing eye of God](http://www.utlm.org/images/masonictemplearticle/thesaltlaketemple_p156.jpg) on the second window, [moon](https://www.google.com/search?q=sun+stone+salt+lake+temple&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=swW&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ouoDUsbgLImuyQG1r4CQBg&amp;ved=0CC8QsAQ&amp;biw=1343&amp;bih=746#bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=67f436ee66bfb56f&amp;q=moon+stone+salt+lake+temple&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&amp;sa=1&amp;tbm=isch) and star stones and talk about the glories of heaven.

They do cover the  basic facts about the temple taking 40 years to build and might even mention the railroad if pressed.  [Wikipedia has far more information](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_Temple) but less of a smile.

**Stop 2**

[The tabernacle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_Tabernacle).  They'll tell you all about the marvel of the building, the designer, told Brigham the maximum size he could build it, and in typical CEO fashion, Brigham required an extra 50 feet.

**Stop 3** 

Now if memory serves, the desert state's bird being a sea-bird will need to be correlated I suppose.

But instead we were led to **THE CHAIR**

Inside the visitor center, instead we went into a room decorated by Zion's Canyon rocks and a movie was started.

Scene 1: Family complains of hiking in Zion's

Scene 2: Family has fun together at Zion's

By this point, I must be..."" and then the kid fell off the cliff.

The dad moseys over

Scene 4: Dad comments on how the kid's ""noise"" is now something worth listening to.

The lights come on

They pick me.

**The whole thing goes off track**

I ask them if they REALLY want to know what I think.  They confirm they do.  I explain that I've left the religion, I figure this is a pretty politic answer.  I didn't even bring up that the mixed race couple that is with us that day would have had a javelin thrown threw their hearts if Brigham were there.  I was being good.

This lead to the poor teenagers panicking.  Tears were in eyes and they barely recovered by the end of the tour.  The one who spoke English best bore *MIGHTY TESTIMONY* that even though she didn't know everything

It was a brilliant passive aggressive way to say ""You're wrong"".  They then ignore my existence for the remainder of the trip

**The rest of the chair**

So you actually move from room to room, have grandpa die, and the oldest daughter get married.  Every piece is backed by emotionally charged music, and followed by leading questions (The kind I was taught as a missionary not to use) meant to maximize the emotional effect.  The temple is presented as the solution to all of life's problems, and the multiple mentions of ""Christ""  makes me think back to my marketing training and that this is summed up as ""product differentiation"".  You're christian, but our product is different because of new improved ""Temple"".  Have a loved one die?  Try ""Temple"".

The fascinating thing is that [Christ actually taught that marriage ends at death](http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-30.htm) and yet they continually cited Christ's teachings as the best way to raise a family, temple"" like they were relying on poorly read Christians as the target market.

The sister who spoke English uses every opportunity to dig in to me.  She says things like ""I may not know everything"" and ""There are those who lose or deny the basic tenants of love"".

The brilliant thing is the ""investigator"" or should I say ""Fiance who has been flirted to be converted"" picks up on these, you still love them, even if you get angry for a while... you don't ever lose it"".

All in all

The emotional manipulation, and the proposal that this small group had the only solution, all of which are ways to [identify a cult](http://www.csj.org/infoserv_cult101/checklis.htm).  I don't know if the rest of mormonism is a cult, but that room, that was cultism reduced and concentrated.

Documentation can also be found in the book In Sacred Lonliness by Todd Compton which is available at Deseret Book

**#3 Joseph kept many of his polygamous marriages secret from Emma.**

If he was keeping these things secret from Emma then she was not giving her permission

Journal accounts of Emily Partridge, accounts from In Sacred Lonliness  talk more about each wives' individual experience

**#4 Joseph Smith lied to the general membership about polygamy while he was practicing it.**

Here are some quotes from the 1835 edition of the D&amp;C

**TL:DR – Anxious about meeting with Bishop


I just had a meeting with my Bishop last night about my unbelief and desire to be released from my calling

What I appreciated most was that he was very respectful, it wouldn't happen immediately next Sunday, and was supportive in regards to affirming that I shouldn't ""worry about it"" and that ""we'll handle anything that might have been your responsibility just fine."" (just because I don't believe, doesn't mean I don't feel bad for bailing and causing more burden on others to pick up the slack)

We talked a little about belief and faith

He told me he won’t make me a “ward project” and won’t be “sending people to visit” me. He asked if I’d take the missionary discussions again,” and why and he accepted that. He asked if I’d be open to having a blessing and I told him no, and he said that that was okay.  He asked me if it was okay for him to bear his testimony to me, and given the respectful nature in which I’d been treated, agreed to this.

Here is my argument that forces one to one of two conclusions

**Conclusions**

[A] The prophets are not divinely inspired when claiming that 8 is the age of accountability.

or

[B] Mormons are bait-and-switching their children when they baptize them.

-----

**Given**

[1] Revelation states that 8 is the age of accountability at which one may join the church.

[2] Prospect Members must be Baptized and Confirmed as members of the church in order to join.

[3] Prospect Members must have Faith and Repent before being Baptized.

[4] Repentance is changing your actions to conform with commandments.

[5] Faith is the active following of commandments without proof of god's existence.

[6] In order to follow the commandments

[7] The Law of Chastity is a commandment that is agreed to at baptism.

[8] The Law of Chastity forbids sexual acts such as: masturbation; sexual intercourse outside of marriage; parasexual activities outside of marriage, petting, necking; homosexual acts of sex; beastiality.

[9] In order to understand the Law of Chastity, sexual arousal, orgasms, sperm, eggs, and pregnancy.

[10] Baptism is a covenant to follow all commandments for the rest of one's life.

-----

**Arguments**

[11] In order to join the church

[12] If a member does not think that an 8-year-old is capable of understanding [9], [6], [5], [4], [3], [2], and therefore is a denial of [1], Conclusion [A].

[13] If a member does not think that an 8-year-old is capable of understanding [9], and are truly lying to their children, and forcing them into a lifelong commitment^[10] to something they never agreed to. Therefore, Conclusion [B].

First off.. I am 60 years of age. I was born into a very strict Mormon family. I have not been active in the church since I had a choice to make in the matter..

but I am unusual... I have NEVER given my ""testimony"". Not ever. Not even one time. Once you read about my background you will wonder why.. to this day I still do.

here is some background.

All of my relatives are Mormon My great grandfather on my mother's side was a polygamist. My other great grandfather followed Joseph Smith from New York to Salt Lake City. 

I have two brothers who have both been on Missions.. and are currently active. One is a bishop. The other is a Stake Missionary.

My parents went on FIVE Missions. That's right.. FIVE. Including Temple Square and the Phillipines. 

I am the only ""non-believer"" in my family that I am aware of. 

I can recall at an early age that I disliked going to church. Don't ask me why

We used to sit in mutual

So for some odd reason I will never be able to explain

So here fellow Redditors.. is .. my first testimony.

I know that Joseph Smith was a fraud. I am totally convinced he was not a prophet. I believe with all my heart that he made everything up. I know that Thomas Monson is not a prophet
And I say these things in the name of science

And that is my testimony.

Most of us like hot dogs, and easy. We started eating them at a young age, and most everyone we know eats them too. We've all heard rumors that if you really knew how hot dogs were made you wouldn't eat them anymore. Most of us choose to ignore this and put it out of our mind. We are afraid to learn more because we sort of know that we'll either need to stop eating hot dogs or at least our enjoyment of them will be diminished. Ignorance is bliss. 

Some of us build up the courage to read a [book](http://www.amazon.com/Eating-Animals-ebook/dp/B002SSBD6W) or [two](http://www.amazon.com/Love-Dogs-Pigs-Wear-Cows/dp/1573245054/ref=zg_bs_14454_20) or watch a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NzUm7UEEIY) or [two(NSFW)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykTH_b-cXyE). After being exposed to the whole story our ignorance is lost and it can never be regained. We are then forced to make an uncomfortable choice between rejecting the practice or continuing it with a tainted perspective. Apologist will offer some explanations

Warning: This has turned into a an enumerated rant.  

1.  Anything to do with the second coming of Jesus.  They've been predicting it for years

2.  Brigham Young was a prophet of God.  Joseph Smith and the BoM had me going for a while

3.  The church will fill the whole earth.  I can thank my BYU Mission Prep professor for debunking that.  The numbers don't lie

4.  The Priesthood can actually heal people or move mountains.  The pioneers could have used some mountain moving.  Wyoming blows.

5.  The temple ceremony is inspired of god.  That thing was creepy the first time(Can you say violated with oil?) and most every time since then.

6.  We are the valiant

7.  The world is getting worse and more filled with sin.  I kinda feel like people have always been huge dicks to each other.  If anything this is one of the best times for humanity

8.  The celestial kingdom is where we all should want to go.  Most the people I run into that claim to want go to the celestial kingdom are kind of cunts.

9.  Jesus cares about us individually and answers all our prayers.  Again

10.  Fasting helps and temple prayer rolls can give you an extra boost in the miracle queue.  That prayer is creepy(and pretty sexist) and I'm hungry goddamnit.

11.  The Church is right for everybody.  With 15 white dudes at the head, rather than anything resembling a universal approach.

12.  The Spirit is a real thing that actually does stuff.  I've heard it described in exact opposition to other descriptions of it.  Basically

13.  Homosexuality is a sin.  God is cruel if that's the case.  This epiphany only hit me earlier this year when a guy said he struggles with same-gender attraction over the pulpit.  He is basically doomed to a life of loneliness under current church policies and he is actually subjecting himself to it.  So heart wrenching.

(On modesty): Women, I wish I was as brave as him. (actual quote)

Rather then getting some good pointers on being less selfish, his simple answer was go back to church.  Sparing you the long details, he basically said that the lord would bless me for being faithful and active.  I asked him if that was it, and he said yes.  The Lord would take care of everything if I served him.  He also threw in the importance of tithing, AKA buying blessings.

At this point I was desperate to save our marriage, but not convinced the Church was a lie.*

Then I decided to use my brain, 'difficult to hear' conversation with her about my flaws and issues.  I then took those into heart and divided them into things I could change, and things that I couldn't.  I went to a doctor who prescribed me some mild Anti-Anxiety meds and 'Magically' I was a happier person.  And my flaws started to minimize.  1.5 years later our marriage is better then it has ever been, and we haven't stepped foot in church since.

I find it funny how many people rely on God, I do believe that there is a 'God', but I do not believe he interacts with Humanity, and if he does, we could not know this through observation.  I assume he knows we are smart enough to figure things out on our own. (I'm an Agnostic Theist)

* In the old testament, if anyone could exercise some google-fu on my behalf that would be awesome.
* The facsimiles. I said the word facsimile, so it doesn't matter. Really? it discredits JS's authority as a prophet, so I'd say it matters.
* The spirit being awfully similar to human emotions

There were others, he passed off my concerns as issues of faith, and told me to put off the natural man (aka, science, logic, and cited history) and stop doing research at websites like mormonthink. He bore his testimony (typical fallback of a religious person backed into a corner) and promised me that if I devoted myself to studying the Book of Mormon for 30 days and prayed sincerely about it, I would be told it is true. I told him I'd spent nine months studying and praying at BYU and it got me nowhere, just to show him that priesthood promises mean nothing.

I came home and talked to my mom about it. She was visibly upset, but still has a testimony. I don't know how. A lot of it clearly shows that Joseph Smith didn't have a prophetic bone in his body.

 Sunday school was interesting. Our teacher is notorious for being very opinionated and a hardcore conservative. For weeks we've been learning about the atonement

Aronic priesthood went better than I expected. I walked into the room where we go before they separate us into our individual classes and everyone was staring at me like I just killed a kitten. The ward president saw that everyone was staring at me and decided to tell a story before we began. It was about his brother who came out of the closet when he was about my age and everyone condemned him for it. He was a social outcast after that and one night his brother attempted to kill himself. He was the one that found him. His brother had a note in his hand and it said, everything felt better. I feel like I have a weight lifted off of my shoulders. I feel happy.

We met the Sunday after moving in to their ward. We spent two hours getting to know each other as our then 9-month old's played on the floor together on the foyer floor.  Coincidentally, we agreed it felt just like [this](http://i.imgur.com/EUmmc.gif).

Over the next 4 years, and seeing him again was like seeing an ex-girlfriend I still had unresolved feelings for.

He’s a true believer, but never seemed to quite hear what I was saying.  He knew it was happening, but I don't think I ever effectively articulated how far down the rabbit hole I had gone.  We moved a couple of miles away 3 years ago, right as my faith crisis came to a head. My exit from TSCC happened when we weren't attending the same ward, and I wasn't talking with anyone except my wife about it.  We remained close, though not as close as before.  Both he and I were transitioning jobs (and I was dealing with the trauma of unplugging from the church) and just didn't have much free time for each other.

Well, and it would be dishonest of me to pretend otherwise.  We attended the blessing to show support on this special day for them, but I could tell at the luncheon afterwards that things were different between us.  Over the next several weeks, he made it clear through is passive-aggressive behaviors that our families were done being friends.  He didn't show up for bike rides. He didn't return calls.  He basically froze me out. It sucked. But, a lot of stuff sucks when leaving the church, and I chalked it up to the already high price I was paying to be authentic and true to myself.
 
Fast-forward to last night and my family is walking out of the gym, “I really miss you guys.  It would be great to catch up and clear the air.”  He remained stone-faced, reached out and shook my hand and said, “We’ll see. Nice to see you again. Take care.” As he was rounding up his kids to leave, I tried one more time and said, “Hey, Wife doesn’t want to see the new Superman movie.  There is an 11:00 PM showing this Friday. Want to come with me?”  He said no thanks, midnight movies on Friday used to be a regular thing for us.  They went in

Me: &lt;Standard opening prayer&gt;

Bishop: How can I help?

Me: ""I need to be released"" 

Bishop: ""Why?""

Me: ""I don't believe in the doctrine anymore""

Bishop: ""Which part?""

Me: ""The list is a mile long

Bishop: ""So are you just going to use logic?"" (like this is a naughty word)

Me: ""I think that may be an oversimplification, I know the mind can create powerful emotions, hallucinations, schizophrenia, etc. so emotions cannot be a reliable way to discern truth."" 

Bishop: ""Have you ever had a spiritual experience?""

Me: ""Yes

Bishop: ""Well

Me: ""Maybe. I believe these emotions are a manifestation of my subconscious

Bishop: ""When did you stop praying?""

Me: ""About a month ago. I believe prayer can be very therapeutic but I don't believe prayers are answered?""

Bishop: ""Have you ever had a prayer answered?"" 

Me: ""I've prayed for something to happen and it did

Bishop: ""Do you believe in God?""

Me: ""Depends on the day. As I look around the world I see a lot of horrible things that make it hard to believe in God. I want there to be a God

Bishop: ""I'm worried about your children"" 

Me: ""I am too. However I feel it's immoral to indoctrinate my children at a such a young age. When they are old enough they can make their own decision.""

Bishop: ""Your children will be indoctrinated either way

Me: ""The church does have a lot of positive influenced on youth. It had a lot of positive influences on my youth. However the church can also be harmful. What if my son turns out to be gay? The church would be very harmful. Another example is masturbation

Bishop: ""You don't want your children to feel guilty?""
Me: ""I do if they did something to harm someone else. I don't want them to feel guilty about archaic beliefs concerning human nature.""

Me: ""We could talk all day, especially since we are both in a interracial marriages"" ;)

Bishop: ""I haven't head that [about interracial marriage]""

Me: ""It's in the Aronic Priesthood Manual 3""

Bishop: ""I'm concerned about you""

Me: ""I understand. You should be [given what you believe]. But we are not changing

Bishop: ""There are vegetarian Mormons""

Me: ""True

Bishop: ""How does your wife feel?""

&lt;Conversation about my wife&gt; (She was not comfortable coming in person so she wrote a letter that I gave him)

Bishop: ""Are you resigning your records?""

Me: ""Not today

Bishop: ""Will you continue attending?""

Me: ""We will take it week by week"" (probably never)

Bishop: ""Do you want home teachers to come""

Me: ""That's OK if they make an appointment first. Unannounced visits are not welcomed""

Bishop: ""I give you the challenge to continue to pray and ask for promptings. When you feel promptings during the day follow those promptings you'll be amazed by the effects. You can use the scientific method""

Me: ""That's fair

Bishop: ""At this stage you probably can't

Me: ""Of course

Bishop: ""Well

Me: ""I feel bad dumping this on you. I really like you and your family. They are great.""

Bishop: ""That's what I'm here for"" :(

Bishop: &lt;Closing prayer about me&gt;

My mother died suddenly when I was eleven. My dad had been a seminary teacher and principal for his entire adult life.  Grief stricken and left with 5 kids

Long story short: she's bi-polar, materialistic, bat-shit insane. He divorces her after 3 terrible years that we had to endure because he was counseled to avoid divorce at all cost. But, one day she says some terrible things (really really terrible things) and kicks us all out onto the street .

and. . . he loses his job for being divorced. After teaching seminary for nearly 25 years, they all turn their backs on him. Not to mention the financial crises put a damper on any job prospects he might have found. 

That was nearly ten years ago

But it doesn't end there: the church promised him that they'd give him a shot at being a teacher once more if he re-entered into a stable marriage. So he went ahead and got jumped into another marriage, even after being told he did great with student teaching, the church refuses to hire him (AKA they led him on for years, only to refuse to hire him because he is still tainted by ever being divorced). He spent years of his life on the hope that he could teach again, only to be shut-down. 

Oh

Soooo now the man is living in a hotel with no job and no money. He barely knows how to work a computer - he missed the rise of the internet age because he was living in his comfortable cocoon as a seminary principal with a secretary who did all his typing for him. 

But that's not all! Of course, is commendable. In other ways, it just really makes me angry. 

Of course, guilty, and almost psychotic with how much I poured over the contradictory doctrine in my mind. I began my process of leaving at 16, am now a self-sufficient college senior joining the Peace Corps, and feeling great about life (except for my dad's shitty situation, of course).

---

**Backstory**

I come from a family of seven.

* Two older sisters (TBMs
* Me
* A younger brother (TBM and a complete asshole with a bad temper)
* A younger sister (ex-Mormon

When my youngest sister was born my brother was terribly jealous of the attention she got. He tried to make her life miserable and as they both got older he would constantly tease her an fight with her. She always came to me to protect her.

She stopped believing in God fairly early

I didn't know how bad things were between my parents and her until they hired some people to kidnap her in the middle of the night and fly her out to a correctional facility out in Utah. She wasn't 18 yet and had no legal recourse.

She survived it and came back as defiant as ever.

My parents were convinced my sister's soul was still in danger and they hired a detective to keep tabs on her.

---

**What I did eight years ago**

I installed a key logger on my sister's computer before she went to college. I thought I was helping... I thought God would want me to help my parents bring her back at all costs. They told me she was lying to them and they needed to keep tabs on her to protect her.

It kept a log of everything she typed and emailed it to my parents. She eventually figured it out

(because as I said above

But she doesn't know I was the one who put it there.

I have left the church since then (about 4 years ago). My wonderful little sister was supportive of me the whole way. She and her friends even got me drunk the first time and made sure I didn't do anything stupid. She's the best human being I know.

And she doesn't know I completely betrayed her trust because of an imaginary God.

I can never tell her. I can never forgive myself.

Why the fuck didn't I leave the church sooner? It brings me to tears just writing all this down.

&gt;Mormon 8:


&gt;36 And I know that ye do walk in the pride of your hearts; and there are none save a few only who do not lift themselves up in the pride of their hearts, and strifes, and malice, and persecutions, and all manner of iniquities; and your churches, yea, even every one

Why do ye not think that greater is the value of an endless happiness than that misery which never dies—because of the praise of the world?

I was 13. My father was my bishop. We lived in Virginia, he said to me with that funny-guy smirk of his on his face, “Now you know, if you lied to me, the water in the temple baptismal font will turn black as soon as you touch it.” I was *pretty* sure he was kidding, but not 100% confident. What did I know about any of this stuff? I was 13 and this was my first worthiness interview and trip to the temple.

A few days later, Kelly. My sister gave me some pointers, and told me practice on a pillow. I spent several hours in my room over the next couple of days making out with a pillow. I felt really silly doing it, but was convinced this practice would pay off when I amazed Kelly with a perfect kiss.

The following week, “So, did the bishop as you guys if you masturbated. I don’t know what that is.” All of us were clueless except one boy who wisely explained, “Masturbating is when you pretend you’re with a girl, and that she is your girlfriend.”

My heart dropped! I had been masturbating with my kissing pillow! The water was going to turn black and everyone would know I was a liar and a pervert! I was sick to my stomach all the way to the temple, I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t turn back, so I timidly walked up to the font and dipped my toe in. Of course, nothing happened, and I was so relieved! I was also confused, and had a follow-up conversation with my father that was very embarrassing for both of us.",,self,,

I wrote my speech out (on paper) last night, talked about what I want to talk about, and I'm looking pretty damn good today.

And I am intensely vulnerable right now.

It's been on my mind all morning, most of whom I don't know, and they are going to hear my story.  

The thought electrifies me

This is one of the most personal things about me that I have volunteered to share, it's not just our rights we're fighting for--we are fighting for our right to grow up unmolested by threat or fear of spiritual or emotional or physical abuse, and sharing our stories...sharing my story...educating those who have not walked my path...that is the way to do it.  

My feelings against the church have returned with a searing fury, enunciating every word, every emotion with the memory of my closet.  I spent 18 years a slave...of the law.  And now I am Enjolras, rebel and revolutionary, going to stand on the barricade.

Awake, bisexual, trans(*)gender, queer people!  Let these wrongs not be unchanged, let these wrongs not be unavenged.  And also, comfort the hurt, shelter the stranger

I am very very keenly aware of my identity as a gay man

Thanks for listening

**EDIT:** It went amazingly.  :)  Here's a pre-service survey of how it went.  I'll get the speech up in another post.

Starting today, my mind totally focused on the task ahead.  I have been thinking about this for months, very regularly.  What I'm going to say; what I'm going to talk about; how I'm going to say it.

After a very, I went to McDonald's to get some food.  Big breakfast platter.  Large coffee.  $5.65.

Sitting there with my food I began to feel overwhelmed.  With what I planned to share,- so much this would require from me.  I saw an ad for the Trevor Lifeline on Facebook (1-866-488-7386), so I called them.  Got my feelings out.  And, with the help of the responder, decided to tell the worship leader that I may need less time to speak.  

It was very, told the worship leader that I may need to reduce my time to just 10 minutes of speaking, and had some quiet sit-down time to myself.

I went over my notes, I immediately began feeling better, and resolved to speaking the whole 20 minutes I was given.  So I went in, sat down, the music played, I was introduced...and in walked two men from the Mormon church that I know--my old scoutmaster and my old home teaching companion!  Suits immaculate, shirts pressed, hair slicked...

They sat behind me and I asked them why there were here.  They said ""Just to listen.""  Had they been there for PR policing I would have asked them to leave.  Even so, emotionally.  I told her it would be fine, since they were here to hear me too, not to cause grievances.

And so the service continued.  When it came my turn to speak, and began telling my story.

*** Here's the link to my speech: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1iaipv/my_speech_growing_up_gay_and_mormon_given_at_my/)

Now that my speech is up...

After my speech, the expression of independence and autonomy so electrifying...I wish I remembered the name of the song.

After the service, support, love, gratitude, awe, amazement, sympathy, and in the best way I could have hoped for.

As I said, indeed, I was given, and my story was given, the respect and kindness that is necessary for anyone sharing something of this sort.

1369635220.0,1f4hv3,"How did ""Adieu"" end up in the BoM? I'll tell you.",zarb0z,96,14,58,"I recently posted about some Hebrew that our buddy Joe borrowed in making his propaganda

The French word ""Adieu"" appears in the BoM as the final, is argued as one of the high-points in Joe's translation ability.  While it's often listed as one of the flaws in the BoM, often to disprove the BoM's accuracy, I can't find online references to where the inspiration for this word came from.  Today, in thanks to Mithryn, I thought I'd share a little.

Joe was a particular fan of pulp fiction, the infamous ""pirate"" who sailed the Indian Ocean (where Cumora's capital city Moroni is located)...but that's not where it's from.

Some people say it appears in the Bible, and it's not in Strong's, which means it wasn't in any Bible that Junior had at his disposal between 1750 and 1834.

It's often said that Joe borrowed from Shakespeare, but I don't see it that often in his works, and I don't see this level of plagiarism coming from Shakespeare, but...maybe.  I doubt it though.

The reality, the SECOND-most read book was ""The Pilgrim's Progress"" by John Bunyan.  In fact, ""Pilgrim's Progress"" is arguably THE single most common piece of Christian fiction in Western Civilization between 1700-1900.  Countless portraits have been painted of men holding not the Bible, but ""Pilgrim's Progress"" as they sit by the fire.

This book is significant for a number of reasons.  It has similarities to stories within the BoM.  Much of the exposition is identical to that in the BoM, it's been corrected, revised and updated.  It was written in multiple sittings, with a prison term in the middle.  It uses commonplace words, places and names to tell a story in a fictional land that features surnames crafted from ordinary words (Mr. Godlyman, Mr. Illwill, Mr. Prejudice, but plentiful.  Personally

Ultimately, Bible-sounding), and the context of the word echoed a point home with the finality, class and tone that Junior was looking for.  ""The Pilgrim's Progress"" ends with this line:

""Shall it be my Lot to go that way again

""Adieu

As shown previously, read the last line in Jacob then read the last line in ""The Pilgrim's Progress.""

I own 7 copies of ""The Pilgrim's Progress, I do not consider myself an expert.  The reason I have so many is that no two prior to 1957 are identical: no two have the exact same ending.  No two translations are verbatim.  The Penguin reprint of recent release (ISBN 978-0-141-43971-6) is what I quoted, and it's got the exact same ending as an 1825 copy I have that is bound in leather with an old map in one leaf and a newspaper lining the other.  It is the third-most-modified book I own.  Care to guess the other two?

""The Pilgrim's Progress"" is worth your time to get a feel for the pinnacle of Christian fiction prior to the advent of the BoM.  It held a standard that would not exist again until C.S. Lewis (and some say still holds).  The references made to this book exceed the limits of a post here today

A year ago I baptized my son (remember I'm still faking my belief) but I wasn't allowed to confirm him.

When I went in for my recommend, in the interest of, ya know, not letting my wife die of cancer, I decided to pay the doctors instead of the church. Perhaps if priesthood blessings worked as advertised, we wouldn't need doctors.

So, but it was embarrassing in a social context.

This year was my daughter's turn. Since the bishop's handbook doesn't define 10% of your increase specifically

So this year I baptised and confirmed her. Whatever.

**MY FRIEND**

A couple we know had a girl born with a heart defect. They spent lots of money trying to save her. Blessings didn't work (they never do). They went to hospitals out of state. The mom never left her side. The dad burned all his time off until he had to go back to work.

Massive bills.

Massive debt.

The child did not live.

He stopped paying tithing to cover the costs. Noticing this

Now

""God"" gave this child an misformed heart. ""God"" didn't respond to prayers. This man lives within his means but attempting to save her life put him above his means. He accumulated debt

This is complicated

Many of us on here are in one stage or another of parting ways with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Some of us rebel in small ways

This is, we are trying to get over something that once meant a great deal to us. Many of us have lost some of the most significant relationships in our lives as a result of our choice to move on from the Church. Some of us are on the edge of those losses. In any case, a life lived outside the fantasy created by the LDS church is real, but difficult. We are facing that difficulty, and doing the best we can.

So, then badmouthing them with your best friend over a tub of Ben and Jerry's. Or, laughing years later at how gullible you were when you were younger. It's cathartic; it is a necessary step in graduating to something more meaningful and more honest. Many of us gave our best years to something that ended up being a complete lie. It makes sense that we would need some way of adjusting; this is one of those ways.

This may be quite long

Firstly, second youngest.

Oh boy. Where do I begin. I've just gone on holiday with my parents, the more I want to kill myself. I was triggered pretty badly on holiday so I need to write this for my own sanity whilst I'm trapped at home.

Okay, and I never believed I had depression because I was led to believe my feelings were a normal part of being a teenager by my mother. She manipulated me into opening up and admitting how bad I felt a few times over the years, but every time she would immediately come back with ""you're not depressed, you just have low self-esteem. EFY/camp/YWs will help that"". Yeah, okay. I learnt never to speak to her, and just pretended that it all helped. I never, EVER told anyone just how depressed I was, because then I would have to admit that I have contemplated suicide nearly everyday for these past few years

When I was 18, oh lawdy. My mix of naivety, sheltered upbringing and mellowness led to me breaking every word of wisdom point within a month of uni (with the guidance of my mormon best friend, who had recently accepted herself as a lesbian). She was my strength and my confidante, and everything was dandy. I felt bad after my stint, saw Bishop, repented, non-member... yikes.

We were together for a year and a half, even though he was a waste of space.

At the same time as this, racism issues, homophobia, transphobia, and ableism. I researched into every one of them through the lenses of being a church member and could not believe how intolerant and disgusting the church was. It put me in a bad place that so many of my loved ones were blindly following this terrible institution.

At the same time as *that*, but in general. She knew I was a feminist and kind of laughed at me because I'm so passionate about it, but with the knowledge I was supplying her, it wasn't long until she was like me, rolling her eyes through sacrament and coming to me to bitch after every young women's lesson. I have never been so happy because I didn't want her to get into a shitty marriage at 18 and pop out babies and then be done.

This is kind of where it gets shit, not of God""). Yes, I have depression, I finally got over my denial. I'm going to be attending therapy in the autumn when I'm back at uni so my parents don't find out. I broke up with the boyfriend the next day and also realised that I can reconcile myself with the church.

I could live with that. Even just after seeing a doctor, and admitted to my little sister and one brother (the only other sibling I trust with it, I also got him interested in inequality in the church, yay!) about having depression. Done, sorted. It was so easy to fend off the thoughts of suicide for weeks after, whereas immediately before it was so constant I was nearly fevered with it.

Between the doctor's visit and my arrival home for the summer, and that's it. It was incredible to feel normal.

Being at home was alright. I was getting a few bad days a week, as it'll be my final year of uni, get a job, move away, perfect. I knew I'd never leave the church because I don't want to be ostracised and pushed out by my family, but I figured I'd just never marry because I enjoy living alone and can't stand the thought of going through the temple or being with a member of the church (and most of all, raising kids in the church and my fear of turning into my mother).

Oh god, in my anonymity, that he repulses me. Everything about him makes me sick to my stomach. Perhaps partly because he is an exact replica of my mother, but immature and he isn't a parental figure to me.

Well my brother, second councillor. Somehow this calling has turned him from Regular Douche to Holy Shit Levels of Douchiness OFF THE CHARTS. With us, if he doesn't get his way he'll call us (us being me and my sister, he's always had some ""I'm your elder I can control you"" issues) selfish and spoilt and literally throw a tantrum sometimes, but years of this has hardened us against it. His wife, however... he'll command her to do something, and if she says no, arm, then lectures my sister because she hasn't learnt to lie as well as me yet.

I've given that info just to generally show that he's a douche

I was so angry after and confused after the conversation that I documented it. Here is word for word what he said after my sister (I'll call her Hope) got annoyed with his relentless questioning and the thoughts I wrote:

*""It matters that I ask you if your read your scriptures because I don't want to lose a sister. If you leave the church it will destroy this family and it will destroy mum and dad. They wouldn't be able to cope"". Find it hardly believable that family is so mentally underdeveloped that they cannot accept differing opinions... Now that I've typed that out

*Later on ""I like stuff like church picture books and putting on tapes, definitely worse for wear.*

*I've been keeping pretty well on top of suicide urges lately (only think perhaps ten thoughts a day) but urges suddenly through the roof. Reverberating throughout very bones because I realise it would be to be actually dead than just ""dead to my family"".*

*If attempt must be made, talking about how much it affects him but never seems to mention how the guy is doing...], *I'm sure he'd find a way if I survived. Probably get locked in a room, too, as true beliefs/personality would come to light. God, everything's a paradox. Figurative God.*

*This church is on par with Catholic church. Sister-in-law's inappropriate rantings about Catholic church because of their donation boxes* [at one point my SIL decided to have a massive rant about how ""evil"" the Catholic church is in public because she went inside one and saw donation boxes] *just confused me because we have done things just as heinous. Justin Jones is doing just fine

I had to leave after that conversation because I was suddenly trembling because I wanted to end my life so badly. Because the comments about how I would single-handedly destroy my family are why I'm stuff in a limbo between leaving the church and killing myself

But you know what, beautiful baby sister. We've been chatting about doctrine for a while now, and I know she has a lot of problems with the church. But when she had a breakdown in my arms because she *hates* her life, has no control over it, can't do anything, is so confused and doesn't even know who she is any more, that's what I can't deal with. I can lie to myself, and she was honest. She still believes all the basics, but she thinks what the church is doing is disgusting in regards to almost everything. I agreed and do agree with everything she said, that I am a filthy slut aka not a virgin

Okay

1. I couldn't do that to my sister.

2. I have a deep fear that church will turn out to be true

3. Scared of failing.

4. I still love the rest of my family and don't want to hurt them.

But the thing is, and I've seen how they are spoken of with sadness, like they've died, even though they live in fucking Bristol. I would either be phased out, or worse, as my brother and mother have demonstrated over the years, they'd force me back, and show me that love is conditional. Also for my sister's sake

Also I have nowhere to go and nothing to do

**Challenge 1- Papyri don't relate**

0:17 - Chicago fire excuse already.  Not looking good: Facimile 1 &amp; 3 were not burned in the fire (one even has a map of Kirtland on the back so we have both of those.  Fascimile no 2 we have from the printer's engraving.   We don't have to have 100% of the original documents to evaluate if something is true or a fiction

0:35 - The long Roll

0:49- ""We didn't know... to a house keeper.. to metropolitan museum"" this happened in 1960.  Who is ""We"".  This guy doesn't look like he was born then.  How about this line:  For 50 years the church has not admitted that...""  That's a bit more honest.

1:00 - ""All the sources refer to the long roll as to the source of the book of Abraham.""  except for [the fucking facsimile's and their descriptions given by Joseph himself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Abraham_Facsimile_1.png).   Got it, that matters.  

1:32- What we have is not what was the book of Abraham.  Again

William W. Phelps was called to be Joseph Smith's scribe in early July

""The remainder of this month

2. ""This after noon labored on the Egyptian alphabet, 1835, p.3; also in DHC Vol. 2:286)

""exhibited the alphabet of the ancient records to Mr Holmes and some others"" (Diary of Joseph Smith, p. 45; DHC Vol. 2:316)

Hmm... Doesn't sound like he was working on the Long Roll, and all those who worked with him focused on the Grammar.  The same Grammar that ties directly to Facsimile no. 1.  

This is dishonest, and that Grammar includes what we have to study"".

The other bit to be considered is that even if they were destroyed in the fire

*Document  B was once  the  longest  papyrus  in  the  collection.  It  is represented  by Photos 2, 7, 8 and  9 in  the  present  collection,  by  the  mounted piece  preserved  in  the  Church  Historian's  Office,  and  by  the  same  mounted piece  and  two pages of copies in  ""Valuable  Discovery.""* [Source](https://dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V03N02_69.pdf) this is the ""long roll"" he's talking about, and the photos of it are shut up so you and I can't see them, but any FARMS scholar could.   This is blatant deception.

*Their  intermittent  character  suggests  that  many  columns  of
writing  are  now  missing

Ah

1:40: ""Anyone who tells you that ... Facsimile no. 1 is flying in the face of historical...""  How about you cite your sources

**Challenge 2- Does Facsimile no. 1 contain Abraham**

A lot of what I'm going to say here comes from Egyptology and apologist Michael Rhodes' PoGP course taught at BYU.  Even the Egyptologists agree with this one

0:25- Typical document- The differences in this document from the others 100% line up to what Joseph smith penciled in to fill the missing fragments.  (Source Michael Rhodes course along with identifying these Unique"" bits he cited

[Here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Vignette1.jpg) is the facsimile with what was missing clearly able to be seen.

0:37 - He means like [this](http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/budge/eawallis/book_of_the_dead/img/b017-2.jpg) all wrapped up to be mummified.  Fair enough.  Mind you to invalidate this argument we simply need to find [one](http://www.mormonismi.net/jamesdavid/mormpict/coucher1.gif) papyrus with [Someone](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3392/3473627931_219b3721db.jpg) having hands up.

Unfortunately after a whole 30 seconds on google I can only find [this](http://www.mormonismi.net/jamesdavid/mormpict/coucher4.gif)
  and [This](http://www.mormonismi.net/jamesdavid/mormpict/coucher2.gif) and [this](http://www2.ida.net/graphics/shirtail/liion.jpg)  Yup

0:59 - Two hands out:  [Oh really](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Vignette1.jpg)?   The arms were added by Joseph Smith. Those could have been the leaves of a furn in the background.  Another person standing behind the mummified man

0:10- His leg is out, but apparently important temple dedicated to the hippopotamus goddess of midwifery.

[It depicts ""Osiris who is at the heart of Waset"" in the guise of a young man, bending the right arm and lifting the left foot, below the bed's lion tail, which is very long and curved in a peculiar fashion.](http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/opettemple.htm)

yup.  Unique.  Movement from a leg

01:20 - ""Mistake made by the man who did the carving"".  This is one of the more deceptive bits and it makes me angry.

Who was the man who did the carving?  W.W. Phelps was the printer.  Who was Joseph Smith's personal Scribe at the time?  W.W. Phelps.

So here is the guy working side by side with Joseph on this specific thing, all mistakes are going to be the printer's

01:44- ""Hard for me to imagine""- Yes, between his legs.  Maybe Anubis was a horny dog that day and needed a good necrophiliac moment to scratch his undead itch.

01:50- And here we see the bias, the god of the mummification.  So why is the god of mummification between his legs?  That's a good question.  But once you say ""priest"", one can see the logic that led Joseph to the tale he told.  And why did Joseph think it was a priest?  Because he drew a head on the body.

02:00 - ""A lot of people think we should look to what the egyptians thought about these facsimiles""  Um.  Duh.  But no

1) Jews were not existent in the time of Abraham, the Grandson of Abraham.  

2) Jews did not make the drawings.  Simply that Jewish writing uses some Egyptian does not imply the reverse.

3) ""Ancient Jewish"" covers a long span of history.  He needs to narrow it down to specifics that can be verified.  Which Jews did what

02:27- The spiritual meaning.  That's how I know that [this drawing](http://imgur.com/8PCmZJv) is not king tut being ushered into the after life as Egyptologists claim

02:36- ""Closest we have, arms raised and lion couches).  

[The Temple of Dendera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendera_Temple_complex) from middle kingdom to contemporary with Rome (about 98 A.D.) means this ""similarity"" is not contemporary with Abraham at all

02:36- Series of similar scenes

[Facsimile no 2](http://www.hethert.org/barque_of_HetHert_Dendera_med.jpg)  What's interesting is that the boat does have a meaning but nothing close to what Joseph translated it as

[facsimile no 3](http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2507/4150927350_8c1319141a_z.jpg) Kinda sorta similar.

And [Facsimile no 1](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AYvyTMscoEk/TQz1t_-8kNI/AAAAAAAAAAY/Iu-rWmkvy1Y/s1600/800px-DenderaHathorTempleComplexQenaEgypt589-2007feb10PhotoByCsorfolyDaniel.jpg) 

Here we see the bird above the body, but Anubis is moving in to mummify him because he's as good as dead anyway.  There, hand me a degree in Egyptology please.

*Some are about human sacrifice*- But not the relevant ones.  Look at his eyes when he says ""Some are about Osiris""  Guess which ones...

2:50- Bastet who will protect her followers on the alter from beign killed.  Sounds impressive.  Let's see:  ""Bastet is the name commonly used by scholars today to refer to a feline goddess of ancient Egyptian religion who was worshipped at least since the Second Dynasty""  Ah,000 sq ft complex.  This is a clear case of reaching to see what you want to see.

3:00- Closest parallels - Yes people were sacrificed on alters.  That's as close as you've got

Ah yes

Further note, 500 B.C.  So either Abraham came after King David and Solomon... or Joseph is making shit up.

3:20- Protected by an angel.  Actually, but does give the name of a priest who was being embalmed later in the writings we have.

1339616947.0,v0cfb,Just released after 5 years in bishopric. Atheist now. ,EvinceTruth,96,14,49,"I have served faithfully as a counselor in a Bishopric in a ward in Utah for 5 years. I am 33 years old. I began the calling with no reservations and no major misgivings about religion in general or the LDS church in particular. My personal crisis of faith began in the last year of my service but I decided to continue to serve faithfully as a measure of due diligence. Our tour of duty ended recently and now I am 100% resolved in the notion that leaving the church is the right thing to do. Now begins the terrifying and likely slow and arduous process of coming out as a non believer. I am married with 2 children and will be as patient as I need to be in order to mitigate damages.

**EDIT**: I'll give an account of my shift from believer to non: 

My story might not be as much of interest to you guys in this /r/ because by crisis of faith was more on a macro level than a LDS-specific level. 

I began to really grapple with the fact that we find it so easy to dismiss other religions out of hand. We have no problem recognizing other faiths (Eastern, or as social constructs, or even as genuine attempts by other cultures and other communities to find meaning in life, to find comfort in death, to find answers in mystery. We see so clearly that these are simply traditions and not divine. We recognize, in other religions, that even though they have holy scripture, ordinances, who pray and receive confirmation just like we do

I started to think, the book of Mormon, the pearl of great price, doctrine and covenants or uttered by modern day prophets that could not have been written or uttered given the knowledge, philosophies, technologies, etc that were accessible at the time they were written or spoken. In other words is there *anything* that is ahead of its time or a departure from the given cultural landscape? NO. 

Everything you see in every religion, in the time and place that they arose from. The dots connect so clearly that you get a sick embarrassing feeling that you were ever blind to it. 

The thing that got under my skin then and now is the degree of arrogance that comes from saying that our tiny little offshoot of a religion is the only true and living church on the planet. Lets just suppose that that claim was true. Imagine the impossibly tiny percent of the human race that has been part of the the only true and living church on the earth. Imagine that you were lucky enough to win the family and geographic lottery that placed you securely in this tiny and fortunate group. Why would you be arrogant about that? You would acknowledge your profoundly improbable fortune every day and admit how it defies all logic and probability. Noboday talks like that. And if you don't think it was luck and you think it was divine providence then what in the HELL makes you so special. 

I am NOT special

Finally, and Oxford press defending the LDS concept of Deity. I was a budding apologist for the church. I have seen all claims leveled against it but my final moments of clarity regarding the church came at the macro level of religion in general. I am so happy that I no longer have to spend energy doing intellectual acrobatics in order to defend indefensible propositions.

1336750883.0,tiags,My brother responding to an email string from active family members who oppose gay rights.  Proud of him for speaking out.    ,balaams-donkey,94,12,17,"Mom &amp; Family

Yes Mom, and compassionate. So while we are on the gay marriage topic I would like to add a few thoughts of my own. I would like to state clearly that I support gay marriage. I would also like to state that I believe in “The Case for Marriage” you made but not exclusively reserved for straight people. Before I give some my reasons, I would like to address some popular quotes from the Church in their stance against gay marriage.


First a quote from the LDS Press release.

“Court decisions in Massachusetts (2004) and California (2008) have allowed same-sex marriages. This trend constitutes a serious threat to marriage and family. The institution of marriage will be weakened


My response:

Let’s examine closely some of these claims.  How does gay marriage “constitute a serious threat to marriage?” How will “the institution of marriage be weakened” if gay people marry? What “negative consequences for both adults and children” will result from Gay marriage?   

Of course there was no evidence given to support any of these claims. No logical connection is made whatsoever. These claims are without merit and only serve to create a false dilemma and an appeal to fear.

If one makes the argument that two gay people who are married will ruin the institution of marriage then clearly on those grounds I could make the same argument that two gay people who are dating will ruin the dating process for straight people. This type of logic would then call for new legislation that prohibits gay people from dating

The arguments from the church and its members presented against equal marriage rights for same-sex couples are almost identical to the arguments which were presented over the years against women's suffrage, removing the bans on interracial marriage, banning sexual discrimination in the workplace, and other social advances. The arguments made no sense then, and they make no sense now. The dire consequences predicted by those improvements in society have not materialized, and neither will the dire consequences prophesied for same-sex marriage materialize.

 

Second Quote: From Gordon B. Hinckley

“Some portray legalization of so-called same-sex marriage as a civil right. This is not a matter of civil rights; it is a matter of morality. Others question our constitutional right as a church to raise our voice on an issue that is of critical importance to the future of the family. We believe that defending this sacred institution by working to preserve traditional marriage lies clearly within our religious and constitutional prerogatives. Indeed


My Response:

Notice that the logic that Hinckley uses was also used by the Christian mob. Polygamy was “not a matter of civil rights” for them but a “matter of morality”, one man one woman, by driving out the polygamous Mormons to “preserve traditional marriage” and this was “clearly within their religious and constitutional prerogatives” or so they justified. Remember, for Hinckley and the church, believe gay marriage is “not a matter of civil rights”, the Christian mob clearly felt this way too, and they gave them no civil treatment. The Mob was “compelled” to drive out the immoral polygamous Mormons, the Christian Mob and the Government didn’t respect or acknowledge plural marriage as legitimate or accept Joseph Smith as prophet. This same attitude holds true for many faithful Mormons; they believe gay marriage corrupts traditional marriage so therefore it is justified to deny them civil rights. Do you see the conflict here?  Gay people are seeking marriage certificates and equality

Most all black people I associate with including my wife are for gay marriage not because they necessarily endorse that life style but because they know what it is like to be treated like second class citizens
Reasons for Marriage:

In “the case for marriage” there are several benefits listed for married people. Clearly these benefits for married couples translate to a better society, they contribute more to the overall wellbeing of the community, this is a very good and desirable thing!


Proposition A: Case for marriage


Better Financial picture

Longer Life

Better mental Health

Greater Safety

Better Sex

More shared sacrifice for the well being of the community (my addition)


Proposition B: The opposite of A. No marriage, no equal rights, harder life.


Not as good as married people’s finances:  More debt

Shorter Life: Blacks had shorter lives too when they were not given equal rights because of the violence against them

More susceptible to poor Mental Health: Depression, poor self image. People with mental health are more at risk for suicide. Type in gay suicide on Google and read the reports. Poor mental health can lead to impaired ability to form healthy relationships.

Less Safety:  Before and after the civil rights movements, just type in “gay people attacked” in your Google browser and then go to videos. Would it seem irreverent to assume that societies who deny equal rights to minority groups make it easier for some of its citizens to justify hate crimes?

Promiscuous sex: Single people

Less shared sacrifice for the community: Unmarried people will give back less to the community than married people. This is undesirable.

Clearly

So the real question is this; If we take “the case for marriage” seriously, then why would anyone deny gay people, living in the community, the right to marry, especially when marriage is proven to be better for the overall wellbeing of the community in which we all live and pay into?!

Room for disagreement: this is a website by faithful active Mormons who are pro gay rights. It’s a great way to become more informed on the topic by other people who share your beliefs.

She realized that there wasn't much she could do to change who I was... and that that scared her. She said that she had imagined I'd be a valiant missionary and one day become a stake president. She said she was holding out hope for my coming back to church until she got 'the news.'

That all ended with an ""I love you"" and then she asked me how my girlfriend was doing.

It was a nice conversation.

At first, I have never been one to judge others so I stuck by his side and even let him know I'd support his decision to go if that's what he chooses. His parents dislike that I am not the pure Mormon girl they wish he had, but he does not care and has stuck up for me more times than countable. 

As time passed, stayed hesitant at the idea of ever going against his family's will. He kept saying, ""I don't want to go, I want to choose my own path in life. The only reason I'd go is to please my family."" I stopped him immediately and said, ""You're doing it for all the wrong reasons.""

After a few more months (months that we had barely discussed this subject) he came to me and said, at this point I had thought there was no way he would actually make such a bold move (even though it is the right one). 

Now, and told him ""this is just a stage, you will want to go, this is what you are meant to do"", while his Bishop had other thoughts.

I have looked down on this church, ""I am extremely proud of you. You have the courage to stand up for yourself, and do what YOU want to do. Not many in this church do that. You're one of a kind. If it makes things easier, I will happily sit with you and your loved ones to reassure them that this is okay, because as most families do in this religion, I assume they are pressuring you to do otherwise. Just know that you are doing the right thing by you and the church, and it's good to have your own voice.""

1367688299.0,1doq1l,My Experiences With Sexual Repression in TSCC,enigmaticsurrender,92,10,25,"I consider myself a highly sexual person. I greatly enjoy sex in many different forms. However, they wonder how on Earth I got here from there. I’ve ben thinking about it a lot lately and decided to write about my thoughts and feelings on the subject. 

I remember at a very young age always being curious about my body. In the bathtub I would touch and try to look and examine my vagina. My mother always reprimanded me

I grew from this touching and exploring to rubbing myself against blankets and pillows. After all I wasn’t touching it. I remember this pleasurable tickling feeling that I really enjoyed and I would do it often. When my mother discovered this when I was around 4 or 5 I remember her distinctly telling me I needed to stop doing that. I asked her why

I stopped the rubbing. I after all was a Mormon child and I didn’t want to disappoint Jesus. But as I grew up and faced puberty that desire for that feeling came back. I began to do it again

This was a time in my life where I began to experience a massive amount of guilt. I hated that I enjoyed doing this. I felt dirty. The church had drilled into me that even thinking sexual thoughts was a sin. Touching myself was a sin, I dressed modestly, I knew the doctrine and I was praying. 

My sexual feelings and desires did not go away. They only grew stronger. I was trapped in this cycle of intense guilt and shame. I would pray and pray for the feelings to go away and for me to be stronger in fighting off the temptation. I could not stop thinking about the lesson of Satan with his flaxen cord and each time I gave in and touched myself or even thought about it there was another thin cord around me for Satan to pull me away into temptation. I couldn’t talk to anyone about it. I feared my friends in the church would judge me as dirty and I couldn’t go to my mom either. Sexual things were not something that could be discussed in my family. Any curiosity was immediately shot down and condemned as a dirty sinful thought. Questions were not allowed as it was seen as asking for an instruction manual to immorality. That is what sexual purity was in the church

I was 14 when I lost my virginity and in some ways I regret it in that I wasn’t really ready. I was not sexually liberated from my repressed Mormon upbringing. When it first happened though, I suddenly felt infinitely guilty. The bishop looked at me and told me “the spirit is telling me to speak to you, is there something you would like to tell me?”. Looking back that was silly and he likely didn’t actually know. However, while in this religion all I could think was oh my gosh God knows what I have done and he is hurt by my actions. That Sunday I sobbed in this old man’s office telling him all about all of my sexual experiences. As I look back it seems highly inappropriate that an older man would ask a 14 year old girl for every specific detail about my sexual activities. But at the time I felt I had to confess everything if I was to be forgiven by the Lord. 

I confessed everything, how they could not even look at me. 

The next three years of my life were spent in constant guilt and shame. I struggled with my sexual urges. I spent so much time on my knees begging for the Lord’s forgiveness and pleading for help in forsaking all things sexual. In this time

There was one specific lesson that always made me feel like I was a hopeless failure that no one would ever want. There would be a tray of cupcakes, or that I was the president of the young women at a time. I was a dirty licked cupcake. 

I remember sending a picture of my breasts to my boyfriend, because the “spirit” told her she should check on me. She found the email in the trash folder. She posted the picture on the refrigerator and then came into my room saying she put something there she thought everyone should see. This culture of quilting and shaming in the church was also so profound in my home life. Instead of talking to me about my actions this was her solution, to make me feel guilty and embarrassed. When we finally did talk it was “What did I do wrong?” and “Is this the kind of sick life you want so far from the spirit?”, accepting my sexuality was never given to me as an option. Guilt and shame were used to make me feel as if I was making some sort of choice to try even harder. Really I just wanted to be good enough, but in the church you can never really be good enough because no one is perfect. 

I went to the bishop again and again confessed everything. I hadn’t had sex again but I was feeling guilty about the thoughts and the dirty talks and the masturbation. I had touched others and been touched and engaged in oral sex. So again I felt the need to confess. After this second confession, as I was supposed to. 

I was doing everything right for once, it was the only way to achieve true happiness. Yet here I was following all the rules and doing everything I was supposed to and I was miserably unhappy.  

I finally gave into my sexual urges again around 17. I started exploring BDSM online because it was so much of my fantasies. I still felt shame and guilt about it but I pushed it way down deep. Decided if I did everything else right maybe it would be ok. Even though I was always taught sex before marriage is the greatest sin aside from murder. 

Fast-forward 3 years through years of sexual exploration. I fell into a deep depression. The more I got involved in the kink community and the more I enjoyed it, but not going either. I was happy, but with that happiness came so much guilt. I had had it drilled into my head that the only way that I could be truly happy was with the church. Yet here I was happy, with wonderful people in my life having wonderful sexual experience. But there was still so much guilt. There was still always this lingering question about whether I was squandering my life in sin and should repent and return to the church. 

I spent years wallowing in guilt and self-loathing about my sexuality. The church taught me I was to be this virginal being and sex was only appropriate in marriage and was for making babies and pleasing my husband

After a lot of time in therapy and some wonderful partners I have finally let go of all of that guilt. I am a sexual being and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Sex is a natural human instinct and drive. It is part of who I am. I can’t say whether or not I believe in a god anymore or not, if  he did not intend for those things to be explored. It would be cruel to condemn humans for exploring the natural drives and instincts you put into them. 

Somehow I made it out of that sexually repressive religion. I found my sexuality and I have found my joy. There is so much intimacy in sex

I work with data in conjunction with Marketing, is to rename a metric until they define failure as success.

Words such as ""Real"", ""Prime"" are all red flags that numbers are being monkeyed with to make someone look good.

""Real Growth"" is defined by the church as: ""whenever a person does family home evening or commits to not drinking caffeine

Poof

Please watch over the next days, and General Conferences for the word ""Real Growth"" to crop up, and replace the claims that the church is growing.  No you know what it really means, it means that despite shrink, the core group is getting ever more fundamental in their practices.  

You see, but the same 20 divided by only 50, is 40%... real growth increases even though families home taught remained absolutely constant).

And what get's measured gets done.  Imagine the pressure to count home teaching instances being equal to getting baptisms done on a mission.  This path leads to fundamentalism.  You can see it in the FLDS when they start out

Please spread this to whatever exmormon boards, as ""Reactivation"" would significantly increase ""Real Growth"" metrics, and so pressure on family members is going to increase significantly over the next few years if I haven't misguessed on this attempt to swap out metrics.

In addition, and is misleading the membership in thinking that membership numbers are increasing, while completely separate metrics are being measured/reported.

We carried on in this vein of conversation for some time until I let too much of my feminist side slip through and made the claim that the GA fast track for women is not comparable to the one for men, the climb up the ladder is even more defined by who they know and who they are married to, and that a woman's status in the church is entirely dependent on the status of her husband and that she has no status without one.

To illustrate this, while a man is valued in and of himself.

Well, ""If there wasn't a mission president's wife, who would counsel with the sister missionaries? If they called another woman, the MP would cheat on his wife with her because they worked so closely."" Then she proceeded to challenge the existence of a GA fast track even though she had accepted the premise throughout the entirety of the conversation to that point.

She ended the conversation by telling me that the only way she could even entertain the possibility of my thought experiment was if she suspended belief in the existence of God and the veracity of the church's claims. Then and only then would she be able to momentarily accept my hypothetical situation.

This kind of thinking blows my mind.

It's absolutely possible to entertain hypothetical situations without suspending belief (or disbelief) in unrelated assumptions. However, leaving Mormonism is such an earth-shattering, psyche shaking event. I've never done anything more mentally, emotionally and physically exhausting than extract myself from the church. It was my dark night of the soul and I doubt I'll ever experience something quite like it again.

But the reason I left was because I was able to entertain a specific hypothetical situation: ""If the church was not true

Last night

She said that those people do not have faith, ""So, we, the Mormons, are the only people with real faith?""

Instead of replying with a simple ""Yes

And you know what, she feels the need to dismantle her entire belief system. For her, what's the point of doing that when the church is *obviously* true.

TBMs think about hypotheticals like this: ""Because there *isn't* there *cannot* be.""

Exmos think about hypotheticals like this: ""*If* there is

When his mom found out that I was gay and that I'd told him before I'd told her, of poisoning her trusting son's faith, and a whole bunch of other things.  She has not spoken to me once in the over three years since then.  She and her husband drive for hours to attend every BYU football game, so they were genuinely and deeply upset when their son chose to attend the U of U.  They feared it would lead him into apostasy.  But he stuck to his guns and they relented.

To their relief

And I am really sad.  The program has worked.  It seems to have molded a previously bright, and now he must set about the business of finding someone to marry.  All the edge, the energy, the vibrancy that used to be so clear in his conversation is completely gone.

He knows I've left the church and I didn't presume to try to start any sort of substantive discussion with him.  To his mom, he'll gradually recover and regain some balance as he engages with the real world again.  Meantime, I am really sad for him.

First off just for a little background I served in France and have been home for about 8 years now.

One of my companions and I started the 5 country club where you had to get your passport stamped in 5 countries other than the one you were assigned to. I made it up to 4

The other one was my buddies in the mission and I started an underground radio show for the missionaries. We were some of the first missionaries to get cellphones in the world

-Edit-
Another fun offense that comes to mind is every year on June 21 France has a music festival. In every major town they set up stages all over and play music all night long to ring in the first day of Summer. In the town I was in the techno stage was set up right below my apartment. As I used to break dance before the mission people could see me dancing in my window and coerced me to come down and show off my moves on the stage. I instantly became a celebrity to the teens in town and they would ask me to dance all the time. That's right left my apartment at 2 AM to go dance for the Frenchies.

I also frequented the beaches on the Mediterranean. We used to go to the big Target like stores and just stand and watch tv. One Saturday we decided we didn't want to work and went to a real French circus. We always took up the offer from the cool members to take us to castles.

Our bishop has my wife's cell number.  This is the coat-tail bishop that is doing a poor job of being his dad.  He had his executive secretary call during the Broncos game.  He asked my wife if I was around and if he could speak with me.  The exec is a good guy.  He is barely hanging on to the church.  If it wasn't for his wife

Exec:  ""Bishop wants to meet with you tomorrow right after church in his office.  Can you meet with him around 1pm?""

me:  ""Dave, I am not going to his office tomorrow.""

Exec:  ""Yeah.  I figured and I tried to tell him but he didn't seem to care.  I'll let him know.""

We chatted for a few minutes and then he dropped this one:

""They've been talking about you and your family in bishopric meeting.  I know you are leaving the church.  Hey man

There you have it.  Stage 1 is in progress:  I am the topic in bishopric meeting.  Stage 2 being ward council and Stage 3 being actively courted by the various auxiliaries.  

You'll also notice the typical Mormon checkbox and procrastinate methodology.  I know bishopric meeting is Sunday.  That means the assignment went to the Exec on Sunday and come Saturday

About an hour later

The B:  ""Um, you know, work out some of your issues.  I, um, think it would, um, be good for you.""

Me:  ""No.""

&lt;awkward pause as he expects me to say something else&gt;

The B:  ""Oh

Me:  ""I fly out Monday and I am gone for 2 weeks.  You can come over tomorrow between 5 and 5:30.  We'll talk for 15 minutes.""

The B:  laughs.  ""Oh

Me:  ""No.  I don't like you.  15 minutes is the max time I am willing waste in a meeting with you.  At 5:30

The B:  ""Oh.  OK.  I will be at your house at 5p sharp.""

Me:  ""OK.""  hang up.


The next day:

Bishop shows up at 5:13.  I invite him into a little office area we have in our house.  The kids are playing elsewhere so my wife stays with us.  He asks my wife if she will excuse us.  I tell him I want her to be there because I don't want any communication issues.  He asked me what my problem was with tithing.  I told him my problem wasn't related to specifically to tithing

He asked me about my issues.  I asked him if he accepted Jacob 5 to be the word of god.  He said he did.  I then said my issues with the church spring from the very seed of how it was begun.  The polygamy, commercial ventures, self-victimization, etc.  These are topics well-documented in books that contain the official history of the church and early talks by prophets and apostles.  I told him I was reading History of the Church and Journal of Discourses to gain a testimony of the early days and in the end, I realized it was all based on an elaborate web of lies.

He asked me how I got caught up in 'anti-Mormon' literature.  I told him that 100% of my research was done on History of the Church

He mentioned that Journal of Discourses was not a part of official church scripture.  I pointed out the delusion of that response since prophets and apostles at the time of its release were very clear that Journal of Discourses ranked as a part of the standard works.

He said:  ""Well, the gospel is, um, ever changing, um, that is why we have a church based on revelation.""

I said:  ""Do you really believe that god modifies the requirements for entry into the highest degree of the celestial kingdom? If there is anything that should be an eternal truth

He asked me about my personal worthiness.  I told him the truth.  No WoW issues.  No law of chastity issues (unless you count staring at topless sunbathers while on vacation).  None of that.

He then pulls out the temple recommend I left on his desk when I walked out of tithing settlement.  He tells me if I want it back

He asked if he could share a quote with me.  He read a snippet from the Pride talk by Benson.  At this point

I told him that I understand pride is the go-to when you don't want to accept education as a reason for someone leaving.  However, I marginalized the legitimate issues of others.  I used the gospel to place culpability where it did not belong.  I told him that I found it deeply and profoundly humiliating to have to admit my ignorance to others.  I have only told a few people about leaving and it was painful.  I have many more of those conversations coming up and I am dreading each and every one of them.  

He tried to get me to commit to reading the BoM and praying.  I told him I have read it dozens of times and prayed incessantly for months.  There was no answer.

I then informed him we were out of time and that he needed to leave.

He asked if we could pray together.  I told him I only pray as a measure of respect for the people I am praying with and declined his offer.

He left.

My wife was there the entire time and didn't say anything.  I didn't expect her to say anything but I wanted her there so she could see it first hand.

After he left

Quick update on the family thing:

She went to church on Sunday with the kids.  My oldest enjoys going.  I helped get them ready.  She texted me during sacrament and asked me to come over and pick up the youngest.  He wasn't having it that day.  I picked him up and spent the morning playing trains.  

She is reading a few different books right now.  Rough Stone Rolling recently made it onto her nightstand.  She is keeping this study to herself.  We really haven't talked too much about it.  I expect that to change in the next weeks.  It feels like she is starting to want to talk about it.  She did ask me what I planned on doing with the money we used to send to the church for tithing.  I told her I hadn't thought much about it but I think charitable donations seemed like a good use.  She handles the money.  When the paycheck came in

Our marriage feels fine right now.  There didn't feel like there was any strain during our recent holiday.  Conversations seem normal and easy.  I think the first place I would notice a strain would be with intimacy issues.  I don't track that in Excel or anything but it doesn't feel like there has been a change in that area.  

I haven't gone to any other recovering mormon sites.  I stick to this one.  I don't feel angry at the church.  I don't feel a lot of what others have shared in this reddit relating to PTSD-type issues after leaving.  Maybe that has to do with the type of marriage I have and where I am in life.  I have a distant family and I don't live in the Mountain West.  Many of our good friends are not members so I don't feel the major social deconstruct that others describe.

There you have it.  Not much really.  I think this is the most boring story of leaving that has ever been shared here.  I will probably post again after my wife starts talking about her research;  maybe after I have to start talking with all of the family members.  I did make a decision to travel to each of my siblings' houses and my parents so I can tell them in person.

""But it was the last session that made me feel bad for him. Half way through his talk he really started to ramble. He went on and on about how much he loved the cultural events that precede the dedications. Then THREE times he told the same story of how the night before he had loved the dancing and twirling the youth did (and mimicked some motions) and how he had sat by two of the dancers who he thought made a cute couple. Since they looked cute together he told the boy to kiss the girl (Then he made kissing noises). He did this three times. Then he said that he loves playing matchmaker and he didn't know what would happen to the young couple from the night before but he felt inspired to tell them to kiss and they seemed to enjoy it. Then he said that his wife tells him not to flirt with the youth but last night she was not there to stop him. He also mentioned that some of the brethren do not like the cultural events but he loves them.

I think I'd like to figure out how to go easy on everyone else because I'm going from full steam to inactivity.  Naturally this is a pretty big bomb for the ward and I have no desire to mess with anyone else's happiness.  I have no bitter feelings and if anyone else finds it brings them happiness I think they are free to keep up the search for ""perfection"".

My reasons were that I'm a big liberal (democrat and social liberal)

The irony is so striking.  Remember that story that is told in church about how the early Utah saints hid their wives and buried the temple foundation and they made weapons to fight against the US army that marched into Utah (called the ""Utah War"" or something like that?). It was supposed to be heroic that they took a stand. Today Tea Party folks fight against the government meddling in their lives

I've often wrestled with myself over the years with the question: If I had been a member of the church during the priesthood/race years

It took a lot of courage though.  We have a lot to lose.  Not just a ward family but relatives

Why did I accept the bishopric calling being the liberal that I am?  I honestly love to serve people.  I like to accept people in all places in life and I like to be helpful.  I had this vain and foolish belief that maybe people would see my liberalism and feel ok to question their assumed conservativism. I've lived in accordance with the church so it didn't seem dishonest to support everyone.

I went on a ward campout recently and felt bad that nobody knew and I didn't want to lose their friendships.  But on the ride home, the sun was out and the world seemed so much bigger.

Despite the freshness of my account

I feel a little out of place because I am not now nor have I ever been a Mormon. But I married one over 10 years ago. And I supported my wife's decision to be active

First, she just reads). In fact, she's probably reading this very message (hi Honey!). She has been struggling with doubts for a while but thanks to this subreddit she has found the strength and vision to follow her heart. And aside from some residual anger about being lied to for years, she feels very good about her decision to shed the religion she was raised in, and relieved there are others like her. And that makes me very happy. It's wonderful to see her find her voice and use her wonderful intelligence to analyze the church and put its many flaws n perspective.

I am convinced that for every person who speaks up and shares their story here, 20... who knows how many others who are silently being enlightened and finding strength and freedom to escape from the guilt of their upbringing. All thanks to you courageous people!

Second, some weird, some total assholes, just like any group in society). That includes most of my in-laws (who despite their fanatical faiths are definitely at the 'really nice' end of the scale). Also, I've seen the religion's impact on both adults and kids over the span of a decade or so (not pretty!). I was married in a Mormon church. I used to attend sacrament meetings with my wife (until I finally got pissed off with the old assholes from the stake spouting ridiculously intolerant crap about other religions, atheists, etc.). I've had to listen to untold rambling and absurd testimonies, hear loads of little kids ""bury"" their testimony with a parent hovering at their shoulder telling them exactly what to say (oh God those were cringe-worthy!). And I've been hounded by missionaries

And in all those experiences the church has always seemed flawed and slightly creepy to me. But I felt like I was the only one who wasn't buying it. Was there something wrong with me? Was the emperor really wearing new clothes?! It is so great to know my judgement wasn't off; to know that lots of people who were raised in the church also shared my misgivings about it. So thank you for that as well.

Please keep up the good fight! It's not just your passion and your conviction that makes this such a great place. It's also the objectiveness

Thanks.

&gt;&gt; To General Authorities, Mission Presidents, and Bishops. 

&gt;&gt; Dear Brethren: 

... 

&gt;&gt; The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints owes its origin, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.” 

&gt;&gt; **From the beginning of this dispensation, and the progeny of our earthly parents Adam and Eve, were not yet to receive the priesthood, for reasons which we believe are known to God, but which He has not made fully known to man.**

&gt;&gt; Our living prophet, “The seeming discrimination by the Church toward the Negro is not something which originated with man; but goes back into the beginning with God…. 

&gt;&gt; “Revelation assures us that this plan antedates man’s mortal existence

&gt;&gt; President McKay has also said

&gt;&gt; Until God reveals His will in this matter, when it is conferred on any man comes as a blessing from God, not of men. 

&gt;&gt; We feel nothing but love, endowments, and the earnest strivings of our Negro brothers and sisters. We are eager to share with men of all races the blessings of the Gospel. We have no racially-segregated congregations. 

&gt;&gt; **Were we the leaders of an enterprise created by ourselves and operated only according to our own earthly wisdom

&gt;&gt; **We recognize that those who do not accept the principle of modern revelation may oppose our point of view. We repeat that such would not wish for membership in the Church

...

&gt;&gt; Faithfully your brethren

&gt;&gt;The First Presidency



&gt;&gt; By Hugh B. Brown
&gt;&gt; N. Eldon Tanner

----

And from the new header to the Book of Mormon.

&gt;&gt; “Book of Mormon teaches that ‘all are alike unto God, male and female’ (2 Nephi 26:33). Throughout the history of the Church, people of every race and ethnicity in many countries have been baptized and have lived as faithful members of the Church. During Joseph Smith’s lifetime, a few black male members of the Church were ordained to the priesthood. **Early in its history, Church leaders stopped conferring the priesthood on black males of African descent. Church records offer no clear insights into the origins of this practice.** Church leaders believed that a revelation from God was needed to alter this practice and prayerfully sought guidance. The revelation came to Church President Spencer W. Kimball and was affirmed to other Church leaders in the Salt Lake Temple on June 1, 1978. The revelation removed all restrictions with regards to race that once applied to the priesthood.”


----

There you have it.   In 1969, directly from Joseph Smith.   This was while the Ban was in effect.  

A little more than 3 decades later and the first presidency letter is forgotten entirely.  Pushed into the memory whole.  Now it is claimed ""Church records offer no clear insights into the origin of the practice.""

[Liar

----

**PS**: This 1969 letter claims not to know the reasons behind the Black Ban

See the [**August 17, on which is founded the doctrine of the Church from the days of its organization, to the effect that Negroes may become members of the Church but that they are not entitled to the priesthood at the present time. The prophets of the Lord have made several statements as to the operation of the principle. President Brigham Young said: 'Why are so many of the inhabitants of the earth cursed with a skin of blackness? It comes in consequence of their fathers rejecting the power of the holy priesthood, and the law of God. They will go down to death. And when all the rest of the children have received their blessings in the holy priesthood, then that curse will be removed from the seed of Cain, and they will then come up and possess the priesthood, and receive all the blessings which we now are entitled to.'

Now fast forward to today. John went to the temple and got his endowments. When he stopped by to talk to my family, and brought it up when we were later alone. I told him that some people had taken cameras in and filmed it. After a few quiet moments, he asked why I didn't believe in the church anymore. I gave him some vague, offhanded statements, but he pressed further. I proceeded to tell him about Smith's several wives, the Book of Abraham, and the historical issues with the Book of Mormon. At each reveal he was further surprised, defensive statements. At this point my mother walked in

Now, and to stay away from John. At this point my parents confronted me and told me how I had ruined what was supposed to have been a beautiful day for him, that I should be ashamed for trying to destroy a new convert's testimony. I explained that he had come to me, and that only truths left my lips, but apparently I should have kept quiet and not said anything that would harm his precious testimony.

Today

Here is the timeline:

* Lifelong, temple worthy entire time, etc.
* Disturbing things started to accumulate on our ""shelves"" over several years.
* Switched to the ""new order Mormon"" aka cafeteria Mormon approach for a time.
* Our parental and human obligation to our kids caused us to start thoroughly examining items on our shelves.
* After approx a year of heavy research we concluded that the church wasn't true and asked for release from callings (I was in the Bishopric) in May of this year and stopped attending church.
* In late Sept my wife and I sent letters to nearly all our family
* Through the grape vine we heard that there was heavy gossip in ward about us.
* Concluded that if they were going to gossip
* Oct 17th -- Sent email resignation to LDS membership records. We asked to waive any waiting periods.
* Also on Oct 17th -- Sent copies of family letters to about twenty families in the ward using this [cover letter](http://i.imgur.com/NphEg.jpg). To be respectful
* Oct 18th -- Received [confirmation letter](http://i.imgur.com/Jcv5A.jpg) from LDS membership records. Very fast turnaround on their part!
* About a week later Bishop called. He asked to meet. I explained that legally we were out
* A couple weeks later he came by our home and met with my wife and I. We gave him a signed copy of the email we sent. We talked about an hour. He was respectful. He did offer to bring Marlin K. Jensen (emeritus general authority and former Church Historian) to our home. I declined saying that I'd read his letter to the European Area Authority and was well versed in the best apologetic answers and didn't feel that he'd be able to tell me something new.
* About three weeks later we received this [letter from the Bishop](http://i.imgur.com/4xjxB.jpg)
* Today we received these [confirmation letters](http://i.imgur.com/MqLde.jpg). My son was disappointed his letter wasn't in the mailbox -- maybe Monday it'll be there.

My family has never said that was wrong",godisgreen,85,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/119ibe/my_bishop_told_me_that_he_had_had_a_lesbian_dream/, but I also still hold anger towards how I was treated as a young lady by my bishop and how my family reacted to it

From the time I was 16-22, gave me a creepy vibe. I'm kind of busty, and in attempts to be modest, I always wore cami's under my shirts to cover my cleavage.  My family sat in the front and during sacrament meetings, he would constantly signal for me to pull up my cami. Like, at least once a week. It happened so often that my sister asked my mom why the bishop had a weird obsession with me.  

When I went to college, so I went.  When I got there he told me that he thought I should change my major.  He had received revelation through a dream.  He then told me he had a dream that I had accepted a role for a play, and had to meet in a room for rehearsal.  When I arrived, it was just me and another girl in a dark room with a camera.  Then a man would tell us to do sexual things to each other through a speaker.  At this point he assured me that he didn't see anything, he just knew there were sexual things being requested.  He thought that dream was revelation that I should change my major from theatre ed.

I didn’t really say anything I was shocked.  I kept thinking “I can't believe my bishop just told me he had a lesbian sex dream about me.”  

When I told my mom what had happened

When I was about 22, she asked me to help her with a young women's activity, so I did.  

When the bishop saw me, and I didn’t request an interview.  Yet, here I was, alone with that creepy man allowing him to ask me super personal questions, and then answering them!  He asked if I drank, I said yes, he asked if I smoked, he had asked for details, wanting to know all kinds of details, I can’t remember everything

She said she too had thought he was a little weird, but she has never acknowledged that the bishop was inappropriate towards me.

To this day I feel slightly violated.  Bishops hold a certain level of power, and you should always be honest with them, that they are the father of the ward.  I was mad at myself for not abandoning those beliefs immediately when I discovered the church was untrue. Instead I let myself be but in a position for him to use his power over me to make me tell him things that I wouldn't have told my own sisters.  The fact that a grown man is allowed to ask a teenage girl/ young adult to come into his office, alone, and then ask her to describe her sexual acts in detail is sick.  That he can tell her he received a “revelation” (aka sex dream) for her and she should change her major.  Its so messed up.

My family (parents and grandparents) have heard these same stories, besides my sister, has ever validated my feeling that he was super fucking creepy and inappropriate.  So I thought this subreddit would give me a little validation.

So sorry that was super long

TL:DR When I was 16-22, asked super detailed questions about my sexual experiences in interviews, and told me he had received revelation for my life through a lesbian sex dream.

EDIT: Thanks for the support everyone!  I just needed to get my story out there.  And yes, and not so angry and the church (although I did begin to feel some residual rage while writing this).

Feel free to ignore if you want to troll, helped me.

** Realize that anything you say is already threatening**

*Why it hurts* - The member has been taught any number of things, to that you are actively demon possessed.  Just saying ""hi"" can be a threatening experience.  Finding out what they expect of you can be very helpful in disarming the situation.

*Reverse* - If you walk into a conversation assuming the member is brainwashed

*What is better to say* - Phrases like, I care about you too."", ""Thank you for sharing your testimony, I can appreciate how much it means to you"", ""I always am interested in other people's perspectives"", and ""I value your opinion"" can do tons to remove the **Fight or flight** response that is caused by feeling threatened.  You are less likely to be accused, attacked

**Ask what they consider to be doctrine**

*Why this helps* - Knowing what is doctrine will prevent accidental toe-stepping.  For example, at conference from the prophet himself, that's fine; and then you know not to quote things that will make them uncomfortable.

*Reverse* - Imagine if a member asked you what you considered good evidence

**Ask what the member considers to be anti-mormon**

*Why it helps* - Mostly because members completely become tongue tied when they have to define doctrine, so please, let me know what is allowed in conversation and I'll stick to it.  Most members relax when presented with this option compared to the first, which they may feel is a trap.  

*Reverse* - Again, let me know if anything I says makes you uncomfortable or a commit one of those logical fallacies you mentioned a few minutes ago.  I want you to enjoy this conversation"".  It's like that.

**Ask the member ""If the church was false

*Why it helps* - First of all, most members haven't ever even considered this question.  Simply considering it greatly increases the chance that they consider other information.  Third, if they answer yes, then odds are the conversation will not simply be an attack on you.

*Reverse* - ""If I could prove to you there really was an afterlife with an all loving God, sure.. but we'd want to try and prove or disprove it.  Maybe not everyone, but many.  

*The better way to say it* - ""I would like to share with you some facts I've learned.  These are meaningful to me and my life.  Would you consider them

**""You seem like an interesting person who is open to trying new things""**

*Why it helps*-  This is a magical line.  It disarms a person almost completely, and this does that by helping the person want to open up to new ideas.  

*Reverse* - it is the reverse.  For members to use this on non-members and ex-members is totally legit.  A more opened-minded society is not a bad thing.

**""I value your opinion""**

*Why it helps* - even if you aren't going to follow their opinion, it will backfire heavily.

*Reverse* - Again

**I know how busy your life is right now

*Why it helps* - again

*Reverse* - both sides can use this phrase too.

**""Your church is a cult""

*Why it hurts* - it simplifies a very complex belief system into something harmful and damaging

*Reverse* - This is similar to ""Exmormons leave because they want to sin""

*A better statement*- ""I'm afraid that some of the practices of the church could harm you and your family.  I care about you deeply.  Can we discuss some of the harmful behaviors I see?""

**Joseph Smith is a con-man/adulterer/treasure seeker**

*Why it hurts* - This is a man that many members revere quite deeply and look upon almost as deity.  It would be like someone saying the same thing about your best friend, and you feel that you need to defend that position.  It places you as an attacker, and draws the line of ""Us"" vs. ""Them"" with you on the wrong side.

*Reverse* - ""I know, you may have evidence; but the member considers their feelings as just as valid evidence as any D. Michael Quinn book.  The feeling of ""Evidence"" is just as strong, and it's just about as aggressive a statement on either side.

*A better way to say this* - Ask to read history with the member.  Read what Joseph said/did.  Ask their opinion on what he said/did.  Let them tell you why or why not that would be harmful/good/bad/permitted by god

**The apostles are all liars, Gordon B. Hinkley hides history, etc.**

*Why it hurts* - when Bernie Madoff was arrested, it typically took a long time for friends to reconcile that they had lost everything and the person on the phone telling them this was doing it to help them.

Accusing the beloved general authorities of fraud is a lot like informing your friend of Bernie Madoff's scam.  Bernie just had fewer apologists excusing why he went to prison.  They are not going to accept your points

This is a very difficult point to get across. 

*Reverse* - This is hard, and Christopher Hitchens not only signed a pact with the devil, but the Pope had been in on the same deal the whole time.  And the evidence that everyone who had ever listened to them was going to hell, forever.  That's how this feels.

*How to say it better* - Again,000, their entire life savings, after spending $3,000 with a con, rather than admit they were had by a con for that first $3k.

2. When pressed she explained to the VT supervisor that we could not accept the history which was written about the founders of the so called church.

3. When the wife of fa1thless did confess these things to fa1thless he was well pleased but cautioned unto his wife that after the next Sunday should pass the so called church would send agents to beseech us that we should change our ways.

4. However fa1thless' prophecy did not come to pass for 3rd day past the confession at the hour of 8:30 in the evening a knock did cometh to the door of the house of fa1thless.

5. Fa1thless peered through the peephole and saw 3 personages with suit and tie standing there. 

6. Fa1thless tried to sneak away but caught the eye of one of the personages peering through the window of fa1thless.

7. And it came to pass that the doorbell of Fa1thless was rung and Fa1thless having his wife just put the baby to bed did openeth the door.

8. Two of personages introduced themselves to me by elder and their last name from the ward

9. And it came to pass that Fa1thless did call out to them that he hopethed that they had not waken the sleeping baby.

10. And it came to pass that the men were not shaken by Fa1thlesses'  frustration

11. At a loss for words Fa1thless declined weakly stating he had to finish eating his snack and also declined an invitation to reschedule.

12. Upon conferring with his wife Fa1thless was chastised for not being stout enough to tell them off harsher.

13. After a while of conversing with his wife Fa1thless realized that he had falsified all of his information from the ward directory and limited his address that could not be edited to ward leadership only.

14. The wife of Fa1thless could not believe that the missionaries would come on false pretenses.

15. Then the house of Fa1thless commenced in all matters of jovial laughter.

**Why this should matter to a current member of the church:**

Because they are asking you to forget their crimes of bigotry and switch your brain to ""they never discriminated"" even when is good evidence that they did it readily available.  This illustrates how the church manipulates history in order to paint itself differently as the morals of the world change.

It is no question that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church)

The LDS Church is the largest single sponsor of Scouting units with over 30
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Scouts_of_America_membership_controversies

In 2000, they serve as boy scouts. 

**Tim Curran was an idea scout

The BSA made the change to the regulations about homosexual scouts after conducting a survey the council sent to its members, which the council shared with the Boy Scouts. Nearly half of the respondents said they would quit the Boy Scouts if the ban on gays is lifted.

Harold Brown

What's interesting is the parallel.  Once

[July 18
""A 12-year-old boy scout has been denied a senior patrol leadership in his troop because he is black"", said Wednesday.""  

Now the church states that ""It is unknown when or why such a policy was put in place [Blacks not being worthy]."" But that is just a demonstrably a cover for statements from leaders at that time such as: 

&gt;""[I think I have read enough to give you an idea of what the Negro is after](http://www.mormonthink.com/blackweb.htm). He is not just seeking the opportunity of sitting down in a cafe where white people eat. He isn't just trying to ride on the same streetcar or the same Pullman car with white people. It isn't that he just desires to go to the same theater as the white people. From this, nor must we feel so sorry for Negroes that we will open our arms and embrace them with everything we have. Remember the little statement that we used to say about sin, ""First we pity, then endure, then embrace""
-Mark E. Peterson

You see, it is [dishonest](http://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-31-honesty?lang=eng)

Active members know the five steps of repentance

The LDS church claims that they have nothing against people who are gay as long as they live lives of celibacy

Anachronisms in the Book of Mormon are just rejected outright as unimportant and explainable (I somewhat agree in this - a lack of current explanation does not preclude future explanations).

Tonight's conversation stemmed from the fact that she needed a blessing last week as she was feeling quite ill. It started with her asking how I could have participated in giving and receiving so many blessings in my time, especially on my mission.

I told her that I did have many spiritual experiences on my mission, spiritual experiences are felt globally by people of all faiths: Mormons, Muslims, Hindus, Catholics, everyone has spiritual experiences. These therefore cannot be used to show that *this church* is true.

This is where I think she started to really understand me. Her eyes got big

I think this is the first time she got it

She asked if feelings can't be used to find truth, and I choose to devote myself to them based on these feelings. I reject feelings as a way that we can identify truths larger than those feelings. She asked if we can't pray to recognize truth, how can we know it. I said I don't know, but that doesn't mean I can just fall back on prayer because I don't have a better answer.

She seemed happy. She is realizing that I am honest in my reasoning

1326594358.0,ohhy3,"""Burning in the Bosom"": A guide to alcohol for the exMo beginner",JulianTheApostate,89,15,63,"We get a lot of people asking for advice getting into alcohol

The first step is to understand the basic types of alcoholic drinks: beer

**Beer**

Beer made primarily from barely along with [hops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hops) and, usually brewed to 4-7% alcohol by volume (ABV). There are a few different types of beer, from lightest to darkest:

* (India) Pale Ales: Pale ales are light in color but strong in flavor. Pale ales, bitter flavor. It's a bit of an acquired taste, but I've learned to like beer that gives you a bit of a punch in the face.

* Wheat beer: These include Belgian Whites and Hefewiezens such as [Blue Moon](http://www.bluemoonbrewingcompany.com/). Wheat beers usually have a strong citrus flavor

* Lagers: This is the most familiar type of beer. The big-brand American beers (Budweiser, middle-of-the-road choice. You still get the bitterness that chases off new drinkers, while there isn't a lot of flavor to make it worth your while. On the other hand, they're great after a workout on a hot summer's day.

* Porters and stouts: These are the darkest of beers, or even licorice flavors in the mix. They can be a bit thicker, and they are often higher in alcoholic content than other beers. Porters and stouts are perfect for winter nights by the fire.

*For your first time*: Probably have a wheat beer like Blue Moon. It'll be the most familiar to your Mormon palate.

*For a little adventure*: Give an IPA a try. The bitterness is an acquired taste

*Don't bother*: With the national brands. They aren't bad, you're better off buying something from a microbrew or an import.

**Wine**

Wine is fermented grape juice

* White wines: Light, Sauvignon blanc, and Pinot grigio, with Chardonnays being the sweetest and Pinots being the driest. (""Dry"" is the rough opposite of ""sweet"" in winespeak.) Whites pair well with fish or poultry.

* Red wines: Fuller, Pinot Noir, and Cabernet Sauvignon, with Merlots tending to be sweeter and Cab Savs being drier. Reds pair well with red meat.

* Dessert wines: These are sweeter and more alcoholic (~20% ABV). [Port wine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_wine)

*For your first time*: Get a glass of Merlot with dinner. Don't worry about it matching your food; red wine with fish is allowed these days. Or get a glass of port after dinner.

*For a little adventure*: Find a vineyard and do a wine-tasting. Places will let you try out a selection for a small fee.

*Don't bother*: Snobbing out. You can get a perfectly decent bottle of wine for $10-$15 at the grocery store. (Unless you live in Utah!)

**Liquor**

Liquor usually refers to distilled spirits. Distillation concentrates the alcohol and the flavor after fermentation. Liquor has a much higher alcohol content (40-60% ABV) and is consumed in much smaller quantities or in mixed drinks. There isn't nearly enough room for a detailed taxonomy

* Whisky: Distilled from a fermented grain mash of barley, whisky isn't so different from a distilled beer. There are many different regional expressions. [Bourbon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_whiskey) is American corn whisky, [Scotch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_whisky) is malt whisky from Scotland, [Irish Whisky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_whiskey) comes from Ireland, etc. On the whole whisky is dark and potent; details beyond that will depend on what kind of whisky you're drinking. For example, I'm a fan of [Islay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islay_Single_Malts) scotch, which is dark and smoky in flavor.

* Vodka: Distilled from a variety of sources

* Tequila: This spirit is distilled from [agave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agave_tequilana). It's also popular as a shot, listed in order of increasing age: silver or white (unaged), gold (mixed with other flavorings OR silver tequila blended with reposado), reposado (aged from 2-11 months) and anejo (aged for at least one year). The older tequilas are generally more expensive, darker, and have more flavor.

* Rum: Distilled from cane sugar or molasses

* Mixed drinks: These usually consist of a base liquor and a few mixers, and [triple sec](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_sec)), whisky sour (whisky, lemon juice, and sugar), Manhattan (whisky, [vermouth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_vermouth), mojito (rum, triple sec

*For your first time*: Get a sweet mixed drink

*For a little adventure*: Try a single malt scotch. Ask for something simple like [Glenlivet 12](http://www.theglenlivet.com/). Feel free to get it on the rocks (ie

*Don't bother*: With shots. Getting drunk in a hurry is a waste of good alcohol.

**Your first drink**

First

Choose an easy drink from the above. I'd say your best bet is to get a mixed drink like a whisky sour or a margarita. You'll taste the alcohol, and that's about where you should stop. You don't want to get drunk your first time.

**Drinking regularly** 

Especially when you're first starting out

After you've gotten a little experience, at a moderate pace -- say, one drink every half an hour -- go ahead and drink until you (or those around you!) notice you becoming drunk. Walk around between drinks, as this will give you a clearer view of your state of intoxication. Once you are officially drunk, switch to water and pay attention to what it feels like as you slowly sober up.

After a night of heavy drinking, and have another glass or two before bed.

Now that I'm used to drinking

Don't take chances with driving. If I've had more than one drink

What you do is up to you, satisfying part of your adult life!

I got into a discussion in the comments about my own difficulty in talking to my wife about my doubts of the truthfulness of the church.  I was given great advice and decided to make mention about one of my issues with church doctrine.  It was about the church's opinions towards interracial marriage (I'm married to a Brazilian).  

I wasn't planning on going all out in our conversation, and I would act sort of surprised by it.  I was doing this as a way to move slowly towards her also realizing problems in the church.

However, she made some comments about how I should talk to the bishop to get his perspective on these doctrinal irregularities and she seemed a little apprehensive when I mentioned that if the church wasn't true, I wouldn't feel comfortable paying tithing or wearing garments 24/7, but only slightly.  I'm sure all of this must have been a bit of a shock to her, so I'll give her that.  She never seemed upset though.

So, that was last night.  Maybe when the idea settles in her mind she might change her attitude towards the idea, but I am cautiously optimistic.

1370801632.0,1fzqjh,[My] top 10 plot holes in Mormonism,curious_mormon,89,12,32,"10. Pre-ordination and the pre-mortal life
----

Let's consider the pre-mortal life.  You're made as a spirit replica of your future body.  Everything, every animal.  Does that mean hermaphrodites were hermaphrodites in heaven?   Either way, that's not the hole, per se. 

The problem is that there are two great sides to a ideological war.  Apparently only certain creations were able to choose a side.  The rest, prevails.  Satan's side is kicked out.  Let me re-iterate.  Spirits, in the same form God created them, before they have a knowledge of good and evil, are kicked out of God's kingdom for making a choice they apparently didn't understand. Next you have a perfect God who knows how you will act, but then he sends you down to earth to prove him right.  

What's the point? Why even create spirits you know are going to rebel? Why judge the decisions of those who haven't become accountable?  And if you already know how everyone will act

Furthermore, and they're all damned anyway since they won't be able to replicate themselves.  And no one is left to pester God's design.  Win/Win.  Everyone gets what they want. 

Back to the earth experience.  If it's is so important then why are children under 8 given that free pass.  They never were accountable

Huge holes

----

9.  In God's name
----

Short and simple plot hole.  The prophet is not allowed to lead the church astray, Adam/God, Temple changes, polygamy, origin of man, etc...).   The hole is that God didn't remove them. 

This becomes an even larger hole when you have prophets [proclaiming falsehoods](http://exmormon.org/phorum/read.php?2

----

8.  God as a respecter of persons
----

Joseph's Mormonism states that we're all responsible for our own sins, punished, and generally derided by the early, mid, and much of the late church.  It was this way until 1978, or nearly 150 years.  

You'll see similar punishment of innocent children in Sodam and Gomorrah, natural disasters, etc.  God is intentionally selecting which children will be placed in areas he will later destroy or allow to be destroyed.  By the point above, we see that he's essentially giving some children a buy on the earthly existence.   If he's able to decide who is worthy and who isn't - then we're back to the point of no purpose in this life.  The twist ending is a plot hole.

----

7.  Contents of the Book of Mormon (Jaradites)
----

The Jaradite story centers on the literal existence of the Tower of Babel, but we'll give it to him as it's not necessarily internally inconsistent ([except for the fact that he's several thousand years early](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Mongolian_history)).   

King Mosiah sent out some people who then somehow found some plates written in Adamaic.  He was able  to translate these via a magical interpreter that no one knew he had

But let's not forget how the Jaradites came to the Americas.  They built barges.  Wooden ships, and with corks in the top and bottom.  It's a shame that God hadn't developed Nephi's ship plans yet.  That one seemed better designed.  They also managed to lose all record of these ships and never make any more.

Anyway, plants, enough fresh water, and enough food locked together in a wooden barge small enough to be tossed around for 344 days at sea.   What's amazing, in addition to a completely water tight ship around 2000 bc lit by magic stones, is that the livestock was able to survive the trip.  It's further amazing when you read on that they were being tossed around in a dark barge shared with colonies of bees and plants.  Yes, really.  Honey bees had enough floral to survive, and apparently didn't all swarm and sting the other animals. 

Now they land, and they have a war.  Here's where it gets interesting.  Fighting for all day, several days straight (minor plot hole, but I'll allow it) with one observer up in the mountains (Ether).  He's apparently able to see well enough to record the final battle without being involved.  In fact, he records two final survivors, the leaders of each side, fighting epically to the death.

And then Coriantumr lops of the head of Shiz.  The dead body then is somehow able to do a push up, but completely unbelievable.

6.  Joseph Smith's history
----

* [The ""first vision"" wasn't the first](http://www.mormonthink.com/img/FirstVisionsMormonInfographics.jpg)

* Were the churches all wrong, have such as strong grasp of the bible. 

* Why is the story of young Joseph's knee used in conjunction with the Word of Wisdom? It was several years too early for the two to be related

* The Golden Plates were [6 x 8 x 6 (in) with the thickness of tin](http://www.mrm.org/weight-of-plates).  That's too heavy to move by hand if they were pure gold.  It's also unlikely that any of the 11 supposed witnesses could have lifted them either.  It's further unlikely that this collection of plates could have held the Egyptian characters to produce 646 English pages in the Book of Mormon (- footnotes) and a large sealed portion

* Speaking of the 116 pages.  Metal was so scarce that God had Nephi replicate most of the content rather than just telling Joseph ""no"" for a third time?

**EDIT: I wanted to throw out a very kind thank you to everyone who has commented. It's been awesome and I've read everything. Thank you so much. Those of you who are also in Utah and have offered to PM and talk, thank you!***

I don't know where to start, with you. I don't know who else to go to, or where else I can attempt to explain what I'm dying to. Let's just see if I can get this out adequately with some semblance of clarity.

I was born and raised in the LDS church. My family was not so different I am sure from many of yours. We went to church every Sunday, visited old folks homes every Monday night for our family's FHE, the whole nine yards. At home, though, my dad was very abusive, and my mom just kinda let things happen. He was the patriarch of the home, he could do what he wanted. He'd only hit the two oldest boys (3 boys, my brother and I were the oldest of the boys), I'd hide from him in my closet with my Book of Mormon. As we got older we tried to fight back or to argue, and he'd speak on Sundays. He'd shake hands with the Stake President

My brother went on a mission, depression, and anxiety all to crippling levels. I lost the ability to read. My mind was totally broken. I spent weeks with doctors who told my Mission President that I had to go home and get urgent care. My Mission President told me I was lying. My Stake President told me I was lying. My district leader told me I was lying. After two months of that I came home, and people would look at me like I was total filth. Some even came up to me to ask me what it was I had really done to have to come home. I ground my teeth - the people are not perfect, but the doctrine is, right?

Fast forward to now. As the years have passed I've slowly shifted away from the church. I haven't been active in going on two years. I go intermittently with family or friends, what the world meant to me, how I was related to it. I understood it all. But guys...I just don't believe it anymore. I don't. That scares me so bad. Not because I am morally afraid of what I have become, but because my entire worldview is gone. I can think only that I have been staring at a star through a telescope, and it fell over, and boom, the whole night sky is in front of me. It's massive - it's so intensely huge, but I don't know where to go to build my perceptions up again, even those who would not be upset with me if we did talk, but sometimes they're so blind. I love them so much and part of me worries about what we will become if I were ever to tell them that I think it's all just a bunch of insanity. My parents are divorced now

If you're still reading - thank you. I guess this is the part where I've finally gotten to the point where I know what questions I want to ask.

What did you do, though, she'd insist on a temple marriage. What did you do about lingering doubts, ""Maybe it's true, you should try again."", ""Think of how you felt as a missionary, what would you say to someone in this situation if you were on a mission again?"" and so on? I am scared...I want to delete this post and never come back again. But I can't. It's eating me and I don't know who can help stop the madness inside. Please, I ask you with all the sincerity that I posses to please tell me what worked for you. The world doesn't make sense to me anymore

1348784521.0,10l59x,Mormonism and my first love,GrizzBoz,92,19,24,"Just found this subreddit.  I grew up in a family of nine that was extremely Mormon (but I thought to be normal as a small child which made the rest of the world seem weird to me).  Anyhow here's one of my Mormon stories.

I grew up in Hawaii and had my first girlfriend and first love at 17 years old.  She was from the mainland and I first met her the year before when she came up for the summer to visit her father and step mother.  We hung out a few times during the summer and became friends before she had to fly back to the mainland for school (she lived with her mother in the mid west).  Throughout the year she wrote me a couple of friendly letters after she'd heard that I had been jumped by some drunken mokes and busted up pretty bad.

That next summer she moved back to Hawaii

We spent months talking on the phone late into the night before we ever kissed. After that I couldn't stay away from her.  She was two years younger but knew a lot more about many things than I did, so wet, primal, and very enthusiastic... many women since then and lots of good sex.. but even the good times are as bonfires next to the sun.

I loved her

When she got sick I scraped together some change to buy her food I liked and hoped that she would like to.  I stood up to the bullies that taunted her for being a white girl.. local Hawaiian schools can be rough on outsiders.  I taught her how to surf.  I told her I would marry her

One day she went in for a routine Dr. appt. and the nurse asked her if she was sexually active... I think it was supposed to be confidential

The father confronted me in a library and lifted me up by my neck.. I was a skinny kid back then and he was a hulking overweight cop.  He told me that if I ever came near her again that he'd kill me.  I said ""How can I see her?  You sent her away.""  ""That's right."" He said

My mother, shivering and covered in dew. Its funny how the middle of the night is cold even in paradise.   One night it was raining and I was hungry.  The family was having pizza and I stood outside looking in.  My mom just opened the door and I came back in.  We didn't talk about it.

The months passed and no calls came.. I didn't know her number or where her mother lived.  Eventually I did get a letter, or what I was doing.. she told me that she had a date with a really nice boy.  I was devastated.  I still loved her.. she seemed so far away.  I can't remember if I wrote back.

Some years later I was living in Texas working at a grocery store.. I got her number from her brother.  I was dating a girl

Some years later I met a woman in college who I fell in love with and married.  She is the woman of my dreams.  We've been together 10 years now and are very happy.  I work as software engineer.  Just recently I joined facebook for the first time in my life and suddenly all kinds of people I'd forgotten about were contacting me and catching up.  It was kinda fun. 

Then she contacted me.  I was 30 now.  I'd forgotton about her

It turns out in the years that had passed she had some rough times, but then good times too, school, marriage and two young boys, born healthy.  She said that she dreamed of me for years... she waited nearly half a decade, then she got cancer and a nice boy helped her through those times.  She married him, he is a good guy. 

She still loves me.  She can't see me

I feel the same way.  I talked to her over facebook for a month.  I didn't trust myself to call her.  I still loved her.  I started to dream of her again

*I really did struggle with porn and it did control my life at some points the guilt/shame cycle was so intense that it seemed to consume everything.*

Anyway

So I made an extra effort and worked my schedule around so that I could attend the LDS 12-step meetings on Thursdays.

Let me just say that my experience in the LDS 12-step vs normal 12-step gave me some serious Cog-Dis and was a contributing factor to finally leading me out of the LDS church completely.

AMA

For example in a normal 12-step program everyone there including the people running the meeting are current/former/recovering addicts.  But at the LDS 12-step the people running the meeting were an Elderly Missionary Couple that had no clue.

In a normal 12-step program you get a sponsor or someone you can talk to outside the meetings to help you out.  In the LDS version fraternizing

In normal 12-step you can talk about your week in detail regarding your feelings and what are your specific hang-ups.  This helps so that others can empathize with you and/or share their experiences.  In the LDS program they didn't want you to mention any sins or specific temptations.  They didn't want to make it seem ok if you messed up so  you couldn't be honest.

Nobody in the LDS 12-step respected the starting time of the meeting.  So the meeting never started on time.  I never ever saw this in programs outside LDS

I got a little peace from them right after the election, but I guess they were ready to start in again.  

Dad told a ""joke"" about a boss laying off employees because of the bad ecomony, ""You're right; we would be better off if Romney had won.""

Instead, at least the guy who believes that God is an alien didn't win.""

Stunned silence for a moment, 'I know everything' voice said, ""I'm sure that's not what Mormons believe.""

""No, but he was so good that he became 'an exalted being', a god, and created our world.  And if we're really good--and we're Mormon--we can become gods and create our own worlds too.""  

""Wow, and no one brought up the presidential election for the rest of the evening.  Hallelujah.

After 2 years of inactivity (and two years of complete disbelief for me), too.

Last night we had a long conversation about our relationship, she said things like my inactivity, beer and coffee in the house, and taking off my garments.  She asked if I would try walking the mormon path again.  I respectfully said no. I'd spent 30 years trying it the church's way, and would need pretty strong justification to try it their way again. I also said, if she *really* wanted me to try again, I would do it with an open mind and heart, but that she was grateful I was willing to do it for her.

I then said that I too, I said ""Last Sunday you taught the lesson of the first vision and the nature of the godhead in young women. There are enough inconsistencies between the 8 or so historical accounts of the first vision to cast doubt on the real story, or if it even happened at all. I let you slide by not challenging you to study the whole story, not just the mythical version the church has authorized."" This stung her a bit, because she had felt ""the spirit"" while working on her lesson, watching the church videos with nice music and beautify people, and teaching her young women.  The sting passed, she said.

I showed her [this book](http://deseretbook.com/Joseph-Smiths-First-Vision-Steven-C-Harper/i/5081861)

It caused her to pause.

I explained the best I could remember that the story grew and evolved over time until it became the canonized version we know today.  I talked about how some versions had angel(s), some had no devil, some only involved the remission of sins and not the ""no other true churches"" statement. I compared it to a story her dad tells about a trip to Disneyland when my wife was a child and had horrible motion sickness. Over the years it has grown to the point were everyone shoes had vomit in them, and the park manager asked them to leave because she was throwing up so much. In truth, she threw up once and waited on a park bench while the rest of the family played, but the embellished version is much more entertaining.  

Then I went to [this page](http://byutv.org/watch/314c34a8-c1c3-4266-82c2-4f755168e7dd/the-joseph-smith-papers-first-vision-part-1) and showed her that BYUTV has addressed the issue at great length.  I pulled up the one and only Ensign article I know of dealing with the topic, and that he told different versions to different audiences (the pearls before swine argument).  I told her the official responses sound more like weak excuses, offered only after they were caught, than an honest explanation.  To me, the most rational (and honest) explanation is that the first vision is a story which grew over time until it became something very different than what it started as. 

She paused again.

Finally, not a literal believer).  I told her it doesn't matter to some people, because they know the problems better than I do and keep attending.  But it matters to people like me because the story is central to the doctrine of the church. It matters to me because I poured my heart into the retelling of this story as a missionary (1st Discussion, 4th principle), having been trained that the spirit would touch peoples hearts to the truthfulness of the message (this is a fatal blow all on its own, IMO).  It matters because it brings casts doubt onto Joseph's prophetic calling. And most importantly, it matters because if this core doctrine is a lie

She pauses for a third time.

""Why would they lie? What do they have to gain from lying?"" she asked. I started crying a bit here (curse you mormon culture for my leaky eyes), too.  A very hard and very important question.  I have my ideas on why they lie, and they are mine alone.  You know a lot of them already because of other conversations.  But obviously, my conclusions were strong enough that I felt I had to risk our relationship, our family, and ultimately my salvation to answer them. You know that I have changed my world view, and that is has come with a very high price tag, I am happier now that my life is lead by the pursuit of truth and reason

How many poor souls have joined the church and heard rubbish like this?  You hear about it in Sacrament meeting at least once a month of how So-and-so put up with so much to leave behind an old life and come in to the fold. How brave they were

Don’t you get how silly this sounds? You are presuming that *you* have the truth! Not only that, but I’m deciding to “fight against it” despite it all.

If I thought it was truth I would have stayed. And believe me, but this is actually how I see it.  And it is not based on belief. It is based on fact. Reality. Evidence. Exactly what the “lord” asked me to do. Study it out in your heart and your *mind*. A heart can easily be tricked (look at evangelicals, do they not feel in their heart that they are right, and you are wrong?). The mind is a little more picky, if you allow it to be.

 

&gt;“you agreed to that evening”

I don’t owe you any amount of “agreement.” I acknowledged to you that it would be better if we didn’t try to convince each other


 

 Whatever “snippets” you heard I own completely.  The silly thing is, church, and in the community, but if you think any of that matters in this situation you’re being naïve.

&gt;And now, as pertaining to our salvation. For their salvation is necessary and essential to our salvation, as Paul says concerning the fathers—that they without us cannot be made perfect—neither can we without our dead be made perfect.

There is a reference to Hebrews 11:40 where Paul is being quoted.

&gt; God having provided some better thing for us

So Joesph Smith is trying to teach us about why we need baptism for the dead and he is using Paul's words to show that it was an important part of ancient doctrine.  This was on September 6th

But in the Hebrews scripture there is a reference to the JST version of that scripture.

&gt;God having provided some better things for them through their sufferings

This completely changes the meaning of the scripture.  the KJV says that the dead cannot be made perfect without us and the JST says the dead cannot be made perfect without their sufferings.  Joesph created most of the JST between 1830 and 1833

I found this during scripture study one morning on my mission (no idea if it has been discussed elsewhere).  I called up my mission president to help me understand and he told me that I should not worry and that one day down the road I it will make sense.  Well he was right.  It makes sense to me now

Edit:  This actually bothered me much more than it normally would have.  Before the mission I had read many ""anti"" materials (this was back in 2000 when the internet was still kinda new) but I always shrugged most of it off as ""they are just trying to tear down the church with lies.""  This was the first time I found a problem on my own with no one around to lie to me about anything.  I did not read it to try to attack the church and no one pointed it out to me.  It just happened.

This is the recommended course of action:

1) Go to your Faculty Adviser.  He/She should be your advocate to get you as much as you've earned out of the university.  He/She will have a list of universities you can easily transfer to.

2) Another option is to exit the university

3) If you fear your faculty adviser (Say that you are not willing to submit to them

I ended up not responding (didn't know what to say

She emailed me again recently asking why she hadn't heard from me in a while.  I sent her this:

*Dearest Granny


*You haven't heard from me in a while because I generally don't bother talking to people who don't take me seriously.*

*I did not leave the LDS church so I could have sex with someone I wasn't even dating at the time; I left for the reasons I already briefly explained to you.*

*To suggest that I ditched a belief system that was so central and significant to literally every aspect of my life, coaches, friends, and strangers, just because I couldn't control my vagina (which I have successfully controlled for 22 years), is highly offensive.*

*I have had questions and doubts since I read the Book of Mormon for the first time when I was eight years old.  I put those on the proverbial shelf until the time when all my questions would be answered.  But the more I learn about people, the more I have come to realize that too many ideas taught as gospel truth are morally reprehensible and based on faulty logic and information.  My decision was not made lightly or rashly.  It was the result of a careful and deliberate search for truth.*

*I was extremely reluctant to follow through once I realized I could not continue believing in the church with any integrity.  It meant throwing away everything I had learned.  It meant admitting that I was severely wrong for twenty-two years.  It meant possible rejection from friends and family.  It meant uncertainty.  It meant the loss of comforting notions and long-cherished beliefs.*

*The church's vigorous efforts to hide its own history and finances are coercive and deceitful.  Its efforts to control behaviors, and emotions result in rampant confirmation bias, cognitive dissonance, thought-stopping patterns, and other byproducts of indoctrination.*

*I reject the notion that I do not have morals or that my morality is flawed just because I have chosen not to accept any religion.  My newfound sense of morality is based on empathy and reason.  I no longer struggle to make sense of the arbitrary, bigoted, and harmful ""morality"" of Packer and the rest of his ilk.  I do not say or do good things because I am hopeful for a reward or fearful of punishment; I do so because I genuinely care about my fellow humans, and I seek to ease the challenges of coexistence that we all face.*

*The list of issues I find with the church's teachings and methods was six pages long when I first created it in October.  It has only grown.*

*The church's political actions disgust me.  I am thrilled to no longer be part of such a conniving and bigoted corporation.  I wish I had done this sooner.*

*I have thrown off the shackles of superstition.  I feel a greater sense of peace and responsibility for my own life.*

*The anxiety which I have struggled with my entire life has largely dissipated.  I am no longer depressed.  The fog of cognitive dissonance has lifted.*

*Perhaps I made a mistake in not making this clear from the start.  I kept the explanation of my decision as brief and light as I could so that I would not put you on the defensive.*

*I am interested in respectful and honest relationships in which both parties can be open and assertive.  I don't mind that you have a very different worldview

*If you still want to buy into the lie propagated by the church that people only leave because they were ""offended"" or wanted to ""sin

*If you are willing to look past the labels of ""agnostic"" or ""atheist"" or ""apostate, then I would love to continue to have a relationship with you.*


*Love

Every year on Mother's Day, I simply draw a picture like I used to when I was a kid. 26 is never too old to draw a stick figure monkey for your mother. This year, I long to do something different. I want to be real with you.

I know you've made mistakes. We all have. However, a wonderful role model.

I know you feel like you failed. I know you think you're nothing special. It breaks my heart to know how much of an issue you have understanding that you're a beautiful person. You don't need to continue to strive to be a good person. You already are.

On your journey through life, and what you believe to be an eternal family. It has raised your happiness level tremendously, but you're still sad. You still believe that out of everything you do -- it's never enough. You're always trying to make up for things for which you have no reason to try. If you always compare yourself to perfection, you will always fall short.

I wish you could see yourself from my perspective. I wish you could know just how amazing and strong you really are; how much power and beauty you really hold. Because this is how I see you :

Every time you tell me you prayed and God gave you the strength to do something grand : I am proud of you. That is your own strength shining through. You have the ability to do anything you put your mind to.

Every time you tell me you worked hard

When you tell me you were confused or overwhelmed and needed God's guidance to show you the way : I'm proud of you. You're smart. You found the way through your own introspection and problem solving techniques.

You are a beautiful, strong person and I wish you could see it from my view so you know just exactly how much I respect and applaud you. I do not give glory to a God, I give glory to you and all you have accomplished for yourself and for us. I am proud to call you ""Mother"".

On May 6th, since the center was at a public university, and was intended to serve a diverse set of families in the community. The name was problematic because Brother Packer has forcefully spoken out against interracial and homosexual families in the past. It is possible to respect Boyd K. Packer as a person, and as a religious leader, without believing that it is a good idea to put his name on a family outreach center at a public university, given his past statements and views that oppose the loving families of so many.

It has recently come to my attention that Jared has now been removed from his position at the University, and the resulting petition. I believe that this is a morally reprehensible action. If dissenting voices cannot even be heard at a public university, for fear of retaliation that might cost the person their job, then how can an open and free dialogue on the issues be maintained? I believe that this is a severe miscarriage of justice, and, if things are as they strongly appear, this is an apparent attempt by an individual to impose their vision of a harmful and hurtful religious orthodoxy on others at what is supposed to be a public university.

Since then, his department chair became increasingly hostile, making off-handed comments toward him like ""You know, Weber State is not a good fit for everyone."" On May 6th I wrote my letter to the editor that was published, out of the blue, but I'm sure we our going to be jobless in the end

Obviously I am very unhappy with what has happened here, and turned it into a petition, that eventually ended up in the news, and that produced some bad press for Weber State, a result that may have partially motivated these reprehensible actions. Nevertheless, I feel like we have done the right thing here, despite the price that some have been forced to pay for speaking up. 

I would encourage everyone here to again take up the petition

Please pass this on to those that you know

Thank you

1363500658.0,1agbi6,My personal rant on Mormon piano arrangements,kingofharts,79,8,73,"Background: If you haven't seen me say this on exmo already, teach, because its a life long hobby. Because of my personality

Let me just say this now: LDS piano arrangements are unbelievably cliche.

If you've seen one

Almost every song starts with twinkling high notes, the song tacks on some spontaneous thirds and raises the volume a tad. Every now and then you run across some fancy scale, or a snazzy up and down pattern, or a little 5 second thought that makes you forget about the melody for a little while. I think I shall coin this section ""LDS spirit prison"", because that's really what it is - biding time until an awkward climax feels semi-appropriate to prepare for.

So

Left hand arpeggios. Always climbing up and down the lower register. I have no idea when this musical mandate occurred in church piano arrangement history, especially if you insert a countermelody or break out some crazy hemiola, but no - its always just plain jane tonic-subdominant-dominant circles. Again and again. 

After the song has been drowned out by dozens of low pedaled notes (since there is not much instruction in pedaling - trust me

The rest is just craziness - a bunch of octaves

And there you have it. Your average church arrangement. It was sort of my dorm room joke/ party trick at BYU to make fun of church arrangements by improv'ing them. We all found it hilarious and so true (I had an awesome dorm BTW - 3/7 of us are on missions - sinners!). Its really not that hard though - I take no pride in being able to do this

But the worst part about these songs is that so many Mormon people just eat it up. The songs are ""beautiful""

And there's only a handful of people that pretty much own the LDS music arrangement world.
We've got the old Janice Kapp Perry (who personifies Mormonism - look at this [image] (http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/_/44595067/Janice+Kapp+Perry+janice_kapp_perry.gif)). Marvin Goldstein. Sally DeFord. Jon Schmidt (I actually had an improv sesh with this guy once - funny story). Paul Cardall (a newcomer). And so on.

I played Marvin in church the most - so my arrangement description is probably biased towards his style - but not by much.

It just makes me sad when people only know LDS-Utah pianists. If you must confine yourself to religious music

And why does the song have to always be happy? I want a melancholy song, maybe even a humorous song! 

Mormon music is much like the Mormon church at large

Sealed off from the outside of world.
Difficult to escape or penetrate.
Claims to stay fresh while everything else spoils.
Maintains a high internal pressure.
Claims to be capable of feeding the poorest of the poor.
Never seems to expire.

Well, and I gave up trying to figure out the reasons why years ago. I usually just sit back and let it pass. Typically it lasts a few hours, or maybe overnight. It seldom lasts more than 24 hours.

Wednesday evening we got in a tiff over a towel left on my office chair. I assumed it was dirty, and she'd left it there temporarily on her way to do something else. She got mad I put it in the dirty clothes, I got mad that she got after me for something so benign. Typically, we have the good sense to stop being jerks to each other as soon as tiffs like this start, but not last night. We're both tired, and both fighting our 3rd cold in as many months. Plus, I was getting fed up with 3 nights of her orneriness.

Things escalated, and it's getting old."" After some back and forth, she says ""If John Dehlin, who knows the problems with the church better than you, can come back to the church to save his marriage and to baptize his son, why can't you?""

In that instant, to keep his family intact, and I suspect to maintain his credibility for believing members who are starting to doubt. He provides an invaluable service to those starting to doubt, and knowing he is a believing member gives them the courage to listen to what is being said. It also gives the credibility necessary to show videos like ""Why Mormon's Leave?"" to their TBM spouses, just like I did to her.

I continued that I think someone’s ability to stay in the church after learning the whole truth has more to do with personality than anything else, years before I had doctrinal, historical, and ethical problems with their teachings. She said, ""What if I gave you an ultimatum like that? What if I told you that I need to be married to a temple worthy, fully active, priesthood holder to be happy?""

I go from frustrated to scared at this point, and my happiness if you insisted I go back. That's a pretty tall order, even to save something as valuable as our marriage. I have faith that you wouldn't do that to me, that you married me not the church. But, if you did draw that line in the sand and if your happiness depended on it, I suppose I'd have to do what I believe is best for me and the children. I don't know exactly what that looks like, but I do know it does not involve the church in any way. And the only reason they go to church now is for you. So if you cut me out of this family, and all references and involvement with the LDS church would disappear from their lives when you did.""

So, and I wouldn't want sole custody any more than I want a divorce, but I've gone full ass hole on her. I recognize I'm out of control, and correct myself saying ""Sorry, that was out of line, and not how I really feel. I'm angry and hurt that you would threaten me with divorce over a church you don't even 100% believe in, and was trying to scare and hurt you back. We have a lot going for us in this relationship, but that having a mixed-faith marriage might not work in the long term. She's tried inactivity and felt incomplete. She's trying full activity right now and is feeling incomplete.
