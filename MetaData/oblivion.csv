- The guild missions in Oblivion are *amazing*. Every quest line is worth doing because they're so immersive. Skyrim guild missions are nowhere near as engaging.

- I miss making my own spells and the spells that you have access to are so much more varied in Oblivion.

- Being able to use a sword and shield *and* still cast spells in Oblivion. A battlemage in Oblivion is far more formiddable than they are in Skyrim

- I really feel like they dumbed down skyrim a lot to make it more appealing to casual gamers

Does anyone else feel this way? What do you guys think could be taken from Oblivion and applied to the next TES game?

Skyrim is great
Mainly, they made you think.
In skyrim

Now
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw7aCFQqQ8M#t=1500s

""A lot of these repeat
To me
This makes it easier to include missions and more importantly

Now
Oblivion: March
Fallout 3: October
Skyrim: November
Which means

And the dungeons. In skyrim, a mini-boss and a secret passage to take you to the entrance.

The worst part is how they were developed. Look at the diference:

So

He did not work in skyrim
I know it wasn't just him who made the levels in Oblivion

This, and I think it is such a shame :(

It has driven me nuts. D:
So, so it took quite some raids to the houses of the unsuspecting merchants in the market district to get enough goods. Tons of magical items and lots of alchemy gear, food, books, even decoration items such as plates etc. were stolen. When I travelled to Orrin to sell him my stolen goods, I already noticed something was off. I had the weird vibe I was going to get a gamecrash. When I sold my items, my suspicions came true: Immediate gamecrash when I tried to quicksave after I sold him my stuff. This always occured, name save or auto save by leaving the Anvil castle smithy. Trying to solve the issue, but I couldnt find anything that would cause that bug to happen.
What I tried to do then is to sell small amounts of goods and look where it would crash. Weirdly, right?), potions, weapons and armor, too. It kept crashing though whenever I tried to sell my stolen food. Narrowing the candidates down, I noticed it always crashed when I sold a single orange. YES, A DAMN ORANGE.

1320692588.0,m3sq3,The Skingrad Massacre: A Tribute to Oblivion,dkevinscalf,54,14,8,"From the darkness my sword slashed.

The vampire shrieked and fell in a cloud of dust. The people of Skingrad could live free of the threat of these undead monsters that looked so human. The Count of Skingrad would be relieved as well.

His secret was safe with me.

The vampire hunters who had been called here were another matter. Should they discover the Count's... 'condition'

Archmage Traven had word that Count Janus Hassildor had valuable information pertaining to the necromancers who had plagued all of Tamriel of late.  This information was vital enough to risk my life

I emerged from the cavern just as the sun was setting and made the short journey back to Skingrad. Being late in the day

It was not difficult to find them. A large man with close cropped, Mog was patiently attending to her guests needs, but an air of repressed hostility crept about her like a morning fog. Who could tell when the bestial rage of her kind would finally well up and snap her into action? I did not intend to stay very long. I approached the drunken mercenary.

""Hmm. You don't look like a vampire..."" he growled over the foam of his ale. ""How about you just keep walking?""

""I wish to discuss that very issue

""Look

""As you wish"" Mog was stirring behind the bar. I vacated the tavern floor and ascended the stairs. No reason to inflame a drunkard or an Orcish woman at the end of her patience.

As I topped the stairs I heard muffled voices. One voice seemed to have a tone of elegant finality. This must be who I sought.

I knocked and entered and was presented with three men; a bold looking Nord with white hair and a chest as big as an ale barrel, though something about the man gave me the impression that he was more than up to the task of wielding it. This was Eridor. He addressed me tiredly.

""Oh no, and wish no harm.. Oh, forget it! Let me guess.. You are wondering what my men and I are doing here in town, right?""

Feeling this would go quicker if I simply assented

""You have my assurance that my men and I will do everything in our power to keep the people of.. Skingrad safe. We're here to help."" his tone did nothing to hide his contempt for what he plainly viewed as a backwater village. He continued his rehearsed proclamation.

""If you have seen anything unusual

We had arrived at the point at long last. ""Indeed I do have information. I have killed the vampires nesting at Bloodcrust Cavern.""

If Eridor was shocked he masked it well. ""And what? I'm supposed to take your word for it? Sorry friend

I produced a handful of the vampire dust that had clung to every line and facet of my armor that day. For the first time in the conversation

""Damned amateurs! You people should leave it to the professionals!"" he growled at me.

""Very well"" I intoned and with a small nod I made my exit. I could hear muffled arguments among Eridor and his men as I made my way downstairs to book a room.

The next morning I awoke expecting to find the hunters long gone

I sought Eridor near the temple in the south of town. 

""Oh hello

""Is your task not finished here

""It's not as if I don't trust your.. skill. It's just that when Eridor of the Bosmer is contracted he sees it through to the very end. There is still the scent of a vampire around this town and I mean to root it out! Good day!"" and with that he turned and entered the temple

For three days I remained in Skingrad watching the hunters and for three days they crept closer and closer to the secret lying within the castle. If they were to discover the very Count of Skingrad were a vampire the mob would have him before nightfall and any chance of the guild discovering the den of these foul necromancers would be gone forever. 

I had no choice but to act.

The morning of my fourth day in Skingrad

Around noon

Just a whispered word on the wind and I had bewitched Eridor's Nordic brother. His eyes rolled up until the whites showed and he let out a roar of anguished rage unsheathing his sword.

""Really

A Skingrad city watchman had been passing by and at the first shout had come running over.

""What is the meaning of this?"" he shouted drawing his blade. He had gotten his shield up just in time as the brutal Nord came down with a crushing blow. The soldier’s surprise turned to focused anger. ""I've fought mud crabs bigger than you!"" the solider taunted as he sallied back and forth with the enraged Nord. Two more city watch joined in one of them fitting arrows to his bow even as he ran. 

Still unseen

A city watchman went to one knee a wound across his chest and shoulders. I whispered again and the wound mended its self and the man fought with renewed vigor.

Several townsfolk had joined in the fight; apparently good will to these visitors had run out. Mog had run out of the inn with a kitchen knife and was trying her hardest to jam it between the drunken merc's ribs. 

When the dust had settled

Too appropriately

I reported the hunters’ deaths to Count Hassildor

From that time

Finally the day came when he could put those skills to work and realize his dream. With the little that his family was able to scrounge up he made his way down to Daggerfall to find passage to Cyrodiil. He passed all the tests with flying colors and a few weeks later found himself in Anvil. Finally

HE rose through the ranks fairly quickly and became one of his captains most trusted men. He had a certain rustic charisma to him that the Imperials found refreshing. He swore away shields and heavier armor as he ""Can't get out of the way of things quickly enough."" Some didn't care for his dealings with the undead and Daedra but he was a fierce worshipper of the Nine and swore away all Daedra worhsip. Perhaps what his captain liked best though was that Francois could be sent on a mission with almost no supplies and be perfectly all right. Which is why he was chosen to head up a scouting mission along the road between Leyawiin and Bravil.

That's where it all went wrong though. Francois had five men with him to simply guard a tax shipment along the road where the next group would pick it up. But in his passion for the Empire

3. When Baurus gives you the option of selecting a class

4. Keep in mind the 7 skills you choose level up twice as fast and leveling them also levels you.

5. Sleep in a bed to level up.

6. Arrows drop in flight.

7. While using a one-handed weapon; block once

8. Save before collecting a sigil stone (located in oblivion gates). If you don't like its random enchantment

As the Gray Fox you should be able to commission someone steal things for you. As the Fighters Guildmaster you should be able to take a horde of fighters into battle.

I went all the way through and grabbed one of those Aylied statues, just for that.

I leap onto a rock to keep at a safe distance and hack at it until my weapon breaks - but the thing's health just refills. All I had then were my claws and low-level hand-to-hand. I tried making a run into the Aylied ruin, with the thing barreling at high speeds behind me, with its horrifying breathing sounds. I get in and think ""Good thing they can't come through doors."" Bam, it appears right in the narrow corridor with me and begins to maul me to death.

Quests? I'm currently doing most of the quests for the Mageguild. But that doesn't earn me a lot of money, and sell them right there ... (I'm sure that's not how it's supposed to go though..)

* good equipment

Not: my strongest spell at the time is the Fireball spell
Also
So what do I do to kill those little creatures on my way up to these towers

**Magic Spells**:


There's so many spells
Which spells should I use at the moment? How do I use them in combinations the best? Any fellow Battlemage here? :)

1361639101.0,1932rk,So.. After finishing skyrim and waiting for expansions to drop in price.. how do I play this game with a gamepad on PC?,Vrokolos,30,5,18,"I made the game beautifull.. Added around 100 mods but I still can't play the damn game with a gamepad.

I know you're gonna go ""PC &lt;&gt; gamepad"" but I truly want to do this using my living room PC with 120"" projector while under the blanket on my couch. 

Thing is.. The menu system in this game is really awkward. It IS designed for the gamepad but it doesn't work with one. I tried everything but I still can't do keyboard only navigation on the menu.

Either drop item is missing or the map can't be scrolled with a key.

Also navigating the dialog menu and storage menus with arrow keys is a mess!!

It is awful :(

Please someone tell me how to completely navigate the menu using the gamepad.

According to this the xbox and ps3 versions have complete gamepad controls even in the menus: 
http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Controls

Those DO NOT WORK on the PC version with buse joystick = 1. Also XPADDER still doesn't let me drop items


Please tell me that someone here has managed to play this game with a gamepad on the PC?

Are you using any mods?

I started off as a spellsword but I soon realized I didn't really like playing that character so much. So I rerolled and played a Bosmer Acrobat. I love using the bow and arrows

The dark brotherhood quest got boring after the purification because I was wondering why I had to kill so many singular targets but my expectations just went through the roof after the encounter with Lucien Lachance and how that entire story played out. 

I loved the thieves guild too! And the reward you get at the end is amazing! I got it early in the main quest and it helped me in every quest afterwards. It's so damn useful and I'm so used to using it in game I think I can see purple spots in real life.

The only quest that was annoying for me was Allies for Bruma but once I finished it

Oh and perhaps my favourite quest line was the road to becoming the grand champion of the arena. It felt so much like Gladiator which just happens to be my favourite movie. I was able to own every combatant with my bows and arrows though.

I've played this for hours non-stop over the past week since I'm on summer holidays and it's been amazing. I still can't believe there's so much left in the map to explore. I think I'm going to keep playing my Bosmer Acrobat and level up my Blade skill so I can wield some stronger blades.

Perhaps I should reroll a new mage character and make use of all the spells I never made use of during the game! Man

I had picked up Oblivion during the holidays on Steam when it was on sale (Got all the official expansions and addons.) I just got around to playing it

Thanks to the community here

I wanted to slash stuff, things keep going wrong. I managed to make it to the Abby to find the head guy.  Some other monk at the Abbey says ""Take a horse, it'll help."" Gleefully I run outside, grab the first horse I see, then I head off towards the red arrow.

Halfway there I run into some shrine with three followers. They ask me for a lions pelt, I hear ""You won't get away from us!"" as all three charge me. I assumed they wanted me dead for not having a lions pelt.

I dismount and quickly dispatch the unarmed one. I managed to knock out the quest giver dude

 I kill him and I ride off as quick as I can wondering what the hell just happened. Soon after I find another shrine, whatever drugs the elf was using certainly weren't in use here, and I managed to kill two and knock out the quest giver. I go back to my horse, only to realize that it had the red ""You stole it"" hoof icon. If I could draw, there would be a giant troll face over that icon.

I promptly started to kill the horse to hide the evidence

But I can't help to think how it would be much better if the quests were more like in oblivion.

I felt that apart from the main quests in Skyrim (Dragonborn, Dark Brotherhood.....) most quests consist in going into a dungeon (a very linear one) killing a strong enemy at the end to complete the mission and find a convenient secret passage leading to the entrance.

That's it.

I have a few questions that I can't seem to find an answer for anywhere else and hoping you fine redditors can help. A little background on my character.  I am an Assassin/Thief/Imperial and have been using the Oblivion XP mod.  I am level 14 and am using the Sword of the Crusader and a glass dagger.  For those not familiar with the mod you get XP for just about everything you do in the game and when you level you get 15 attribute points and 36 skill points to assign to weighted skills based off what is major and minor skills.  I'm not sure if this that is relevant or not

1)  My damage output seems very low, or something else entirely.

2)  After I take 40-50 whacks at an enemy with my weapon my fatigue is normally completely empty.  This of course just makes my problem of too little damage even worse.  I picked up a spell to restore fatigue and that helps to some degree

3)  It is my understanding that after level 19 or so there aren't any new weapons/armor that come available.  Is this going to make my problem in #1 even worse?

However

I really don't understand the leveling process.  I've looked at the efficient leveling post on the UESPwiki thing.  It just doesn't make sense.  I don't know why I can't/shouldn't level up my major skills to be the most efficient.  Plus, is it impossible to be a strong magic user as well?  Like what would happen if I decided to grind every single skill (major and minor) to 100?  Would I be equally powerful in magic, melee, and range?  Or would my major skills (which are geared toward archery) make me strongest in range attacks.

Also

Moving on to Alchemy

What kind of equipment is good?  Right now I'm using a dwarven longsword and a dwarven bow at level 13.  I have seen elvish weapons drop but I'm just unsure of the hierarchy of weapons.

Lastly, etc. skills, the spell always has the same amount of effectiveness.  Do I need to level up their governing attributes to see an increased effectiveness in spells?  Or do I just need to upgrade to better spells?

Put the boots on and went out the door to the next room in the cave with 3 more dawn just waiting to kill me. Lured them out one at a time to confront them only wearing a pair of boots and a dagger and managed to kill the first one. What equip did he drop? All of my original equipment. Holy moley. Quicksave right there and killed the rest of the dawn in the place and at the end found that lousy switch on the wall which removes the rock so I can escape. D'oh!
