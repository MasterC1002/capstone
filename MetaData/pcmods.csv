The last time I did this



This is what my top I/O looked like before the mod

[Stock Picture of Top](http://puu.sh/2mREQ)

Notice the button looking thing under the reset button. It is actually just molded plastic and not a functioning button at all



So first thing was first I decided I would go ahead and use an X-Acto Knife and carfully cut out myself a button out of that molded plastic. After cutting that out I took apart my BluRay Drive

Next I measured how much further in the drive would be sitting in the drive bay as a result of using the original mesh covering

After that I went and bought myself a tactile button to use as the eject button

Soldered the wires to the button

Next step is I want to get some clear sticker printing paper and print out ""Eject"" or just an eject symbol and put that sticker on my new button just to make it look even more stock.


Anyways past all the boring tidbits here is how it turned out.



[The blue outline is the button I made that ejects the drive.](http://puu.sh/2mRQ8)




[And the drive opened](http://puu.sh/2mRSV)



I know on the right hand side of the button there is a scoff mark

The catch with the motherboard was that it uses the BTX layout and as such used extremely non-standard screw holes. As a result this computer and monitor uses zero screws.

So, CPU Fan, PSU, SSD's, 5.25"" and 3.5"" drives, 120mm fans, fan filter meshes

To recap, install, cable manage, and color coordinate. 

Two things I should mention about the case. It will only fit a Micro-Atx motherboard, it turns the board 90 degrees clockwise, so that the i/o panel and cords are on the top of the case. 

The case has four distinct sections. The Top is a removeable ""cap"" that covers all of your cables going into the computer. It has three cable grommets on the back to route cables through.

The Front houses the motherboard, CPU Fan, RAM, and four 120mm case fans that can be turned any way to allow air to flow from either left to right or right to left through the case. The Front has a removable windowed panel. This is where you view your awesome hardware, on your desk, at the forefront of vision where they belong. There are also four rubber cable grommets to allow cables through from....

...The Back houses the PSU and up to four SSD's. With the PSU in the back

The Bottom houses a single 5.25"" drive and two 3.5"" drives. Looking back at the pictures I can see that I missed some of the drive bay modeling for the 3.5"" bays. Oops.

The Ultabox has the following dimensions (these are approximations as I really have no idea how thick walls should be

Height- ~17.5""
Width- ~14.5""
Depth- ~11""

All walls are 1/8"" thick. I have no idea if this is a decent width or not. It looked good tho.

A lot of work still needs to be done to make this thing a reality. I need to make legimate measurements, catches, screw holes, etc. I also need way more skill/time/money to actually build it, but it's a step closer at least, and a hell of a lot better than the original one I mocked up. I'm still not sure where to go from here. /u/Brodholm managed to get sponsors for his Chasis 101 which is really cool, but I have no idea how to go about doing that. So

Enjoy!

(in the middle of the case to the left) If i am going this route I am going to have to find somthing to support its weight as it was ""connected"" to the drive bay above it before. And I also would have to find another place to put my second hdd. BTW i was planning on keeping the floppy drive there to get the old-school look :)

I didn't have much room to work with since my machine is a little old now, and I leave my side panel off.

The mod took a bit of time, thermal paste, and some patience.

I used four zip ties to connect around the Antec 920 and tightened them a bit, and then fastened them down tightly.

1369858779.0,1fagnn,Front window PC Case,Ultamaynard,18,1,23,"So, and really just wanted some input.

Why isn't there a chassis out there with a front facing window? I don't just mean a case with a single window on the front, and organize my case in such a way that it's damn pleasing to look at.  So why the hell does it sit on the floor with a measly side window? Why isn't the motherboard the ""face"" of the case? I've mocked up what I would like to do in Sketchup (I've just learned a little about it, so the mockup isn't great). 

Here are some pics: 
http://imgur.com/a/fphcv

Here's how it's laid out. The case ultimately has three sections, and that whole front section only has room for the motherboard (and components that typically go on it, gpu, cpu, fan, ram ,etc), as well as room for cables to come through to the motherboard. That section is what you want to show off and even just admire yourself with a couple of cold-cathodes. 

Behind the motherboard panel is the back section. That section has the powersupply (turned sideways, but I'm sure brackets and holders for drives could easily be mounted.

Finally, fan controllers, etc). 

I'd imagine that the front window panel, wrinkle-coated steel. 

The main point of the case would be to have a more compact case that can sit on your desk, unless it could be made in such a way that the mobo and stuff was upside down to flip it) The dimensions I have in Sketchup (which are probably pretty damn off considering all the walls are 2D in the model) are H18"", W13"", D11.""

That's it. Sorry for the wall of text and the ill-formed ideas.

I often find myself in a game, I was looking online and I found many touchscreen fan controllers that also displayed the temperature. Now, I myself don't really wish to install one of these in a drivebay, but I would really like to have a display for such things. So, I took one look at my unused Ipad 1, and had a eureka moment of sorts. 

In conclusion, while also discouraging. One major roadblock is the actual utility of such a thing, since I'm unaware of how I'd actually go about feeding any software (I doubt I'd be able to use iOS for such a purpose, another problem) the sensory inputs from either my motherboard, or an attached sensor. The cutting of the side panel seems simple enough though, so no problems there. Anyways, are my aspirations bigger than the reality of the project?

Unfortunately for people who are wanting to paint their glossy black bezels matte black

**What do I need?:**

- 400 Grit (very fine) Sandpaper

- 2 small cardboard boxes to prop your bezel up off the ground (so you can easily paint the sides)

- Trim Tools (optional) (**[link](http://www.amazon.com/Wilmar-W80648-Composite-Trim-Removal/dp/B002KSAZ78/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372129598&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=trim+tools)**) (**[my pic](http://i.imgur.com/MbGgAm3.jpg)**)


-----------------

**How do I remove my bezels?**:

- I recommend using some 'trim tools' (linked above) to help you pry apart your monitor without scratching anything. They are quite durable as well.

- Google your specific monitor model + debezel guide...also check YouTube.

-----------------

**Specific directions for Glossy Bezels:**

1. Take the 400 grit sandpaper and rough up the glossy surface around the entire bezel. This is going to give the paint something to adhere to without marring the actual plastic and creating deep grooves.

2. Clean off all the debris created by using the sandpaper on glossy paint. Use a hose or something...

3. Dry it off

-----------------

**The remainder of the directions apply to both Glossy and Metal Bezels:**

4. Take the Rust-Oleum Plastic Primer and shake it really well for about 30 seconds. Do a little test spray on some cardboard. Then apply the first and only coat. I did about 2 sprays back and forth on each bezel side to make sure I got a good

5. Wait 20-30 minutes for the Primer to dry. It dries pretty quickly.

6. Take the Rust-Oleum Enamel Spray Paint and shake it for 30 seconds

7. Wait 15-20 minutes for the first Enamel coat to dry.

8. Apply the second Enamel Spray Paint coat.

9. Wait 20-30 minutes for the second Enamel coat to dry.

10. Come back and inspect your work. Is the paint too thick in a certain area and have little 'pock' marks because the paint dried funny there? If so

11. Wait 24-48 hours for the paint to fully dry/set.

I have been gradually upgrading this machine for about 6-9 months. But recently decided to really spice it up with some custom case modding

It was a great project and my first major mod. I was a bit nervous on dremeling the case but it turned out really good in my opinion. I know I over spent on things like the fans and mobo but I really like the look and money wasn't an issue. I might trade out the apevia 120mm fan in the bottom for another Corsair case fan. Really happy with those.

Eventually I will replace the 2 monitors with a 3 monitor setup but I need to sell them first.

Ideally

I'd think it'd be fairly easy to make a custom housing for the parts that would be fairly low-profile and not bulky - My main concern would be a monitor.

It would be nice to allow a 22 - 24"" monitor fold down into a padded bay that would protect it ""en-route"", I can fold the monitor up and lock it into place to play games (I realize the monitor would probably be down low, but I'm okay with that scenario for the moment). 

I'd assume this ought to be possible with some type of VESA mount setup

Something like this [Cheetah mount](http://www.amazon.com/Cheetah-ALAMLB-Articulating-Displays-Patterns/dp/B001GTT0VO/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351391595&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=cheetah+mount) seems universal enough to mount the monitor properly, but maybe enough of an angle to fabricate something.",,False,self,t5_2tj99,False,,

My goal is to make it easy to swap components and to get it out of the way to avoid ""refreshing"" my PC with desktop beverages.

I need to mount the HDDs (SSD and spinning) securely.

I'm inspired by [these clips for cars](http://www.exogear.com/products-exomount-car-mount-holder.html) but need something cheaper and more appropriate.

Finally I need to mount the PSU and mobo tray to the backplane. Again the goal is to make it easy to swap components, since that's the heaviest component.

-To build a decently powered

-I want it to be small

**Rig Specs so far:**

-ITX Mobo (Biostar TH61)

-intel i3 2120

**Idea for the Case:**

-NO PSU over CPU configuation. (Lian-Li style)

-No 5.25 bay.

-140mm fan direct to cpu hsf

-GPU fan has direct access to cool air.

-PSU exhausts air down and out.

-black acrylic all around. 

-sleeved psu to help with space constraints.

-Please keep in mind

-Sizes should be spot on

**Where I need input:**

-I'm thinking that my fan configuration should be no problem. I plan to just use a grill/filter on the top of the case for the GPU

-The 140mm on the side will blow onto the stock HSF combo

-I may or may not increase the depth of the case. The overall depth is 100% dependant on the length of the video card. Right now

-Still working on HDD mounting.

-Is 1/2"" acrylic overkill? would stepping down to 3/8"" be safe?

-Cheapest place for 140mm &amp; 92mm holesaws?

The fans have horrendous dust buildup on them and even a trusty toothbrush isnt getting them off. It seems that the best way to go about doing this is to hit it with a wet toothbrush or hard bristled brush of some sort to really loosen things up and turn it into goop

EDIT: For lubricating the fan, and put a drop of oil (sewing machine oil or something, not WD-40) in there to make your fans quiet.
/edit  

For cleaning old crusty TIM off of the CPU

If you bend the pins

What all tips and stuff have you guys got?

Also, just about every single fan except for 1 will be running full speed all the time until I upgrade to a proper cooling solution. To get the extra 3-pin fan working, I cut the female molex off of the Pentium computer PSU, shoved some headers I had laying around into the wiring, and plugged it into the molex fan's connector. Now all of the fans should be working. This was a tricky situation because the front case fan is blue, the CPU fan is blue, and all the other fans are black. I wanted 2 CPU cooler fans to be blue and all case fans to be black so that only internal lighting is blue. This fixes all problems. Pics if you guys are interested,,1338145068.0,t3_u7k5h

There have been a couple of minor things about its design that have bugged me and for the most part I've just made due. I bought a couple of new parts for my rig and I'm going to have to take it apart anyways and I figured while I'm in there I may be able to address some of these issues. I would like some advice about how to go about doing these upgrades.

**1: CPU cutout** - for whatever reason CM positioned the cutout so it wouldn't work with the LGA 1366 processor series so I have to remove my motherboard to reset my heatsink. I just bought a new heatsink so this might be the time to fix the issue. I know that people who do this have a tool called a dremel and the simple just cut it out. I don't have one and I don't think I have the budget to buy one at this point. Is there another way?

**2: Front usb 3.0** - new versions of the HAF 922 have front usb 3.0 instead of 2.0. Is there anyway to get a front panel either from CM or else where and add it in?

**3: Black interior** - how do people get their interior black? Do they use spray paint? or some other method? Do i have have to break the case apart into pieces and buy some kind of rivet gun? Or can it be done more simply?

Thanks for reading! And I'll appreciate any feedback.

I'm getting the NZXT 820 (Black) and am going to buy a liquid cooling setup to go with is for my CPU (1155 socket) and 2 GPUs (7970). 

I am aiming for a orange and blue colour scheme. 

I have a blackwidow keyboard (blue led) and steelseries kana mouse (orange led) and want to stick with the theme. 

In the NZXT 820 I will have orange and blue LEDs but I don't know if the blue will over power the orange or something along those lines. 

I was thinking that the case's pre-installed leds would be orange and the back fan would be orange and then the bottom fan could be blue. 

The liquid cooling would be clear tubes with blue coolant. Once again

Any tips or advice on parts for the liquid cooling and how i should setup the lighting would be greatly appreciated.

1372445270.0,1h9jgw,Desktop DJ Computer,Hiaw,11,3,3,"http://imgur.com/a/Romq6

I work as a moblie DJ and modded my desktop computer to make it easier to take and use at gigs. I DJ with a desktop instead of a laptop because I love power! A full size video card is nice to use when DJ'ing with music videos. An added bonus is the ability to upgrade and replace parts more easily than a laptop. 

My first drastic change was to bolt my monitor to my tower. This saves me a lot of time hooking up my monitor as it is always ready to go! Granted

My second innovation was to hook up a DJ usb controller into a spare 3.5"" drive bay. This way I just plop my desktop down and plug my PA system directly into the usb controller. Numark makes a small controller called the DJ IO that fit in the bay. I actually traded in a larger/more expensive/arguably better DJ controller because the DJ IO is so convenient and puts out a louder sound. 

Combined with a gear grip and a server power cord (into the PSU and monitor power supply) I have a DJ pc that is a portable plug and play powerhouse. Below is an album:

- Screwdriver heads of various sizes.

- Hammer

- Trim Tools (optional

- Patience

------------

**Let's get to work:**

Prep work.

**1.** First remove the outer casing of your Qnix. How? Check this awesome **['Dismantling Korean QX2710' Playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnVkA6ZcoQv5piavGXZDJv3Wj2E4MT_iE)** if that isn't thorough enough or you want a second source
**2.** Unscrew the PCB box from the back of plastic casing and then remove the metal sheet that protects the PCB by removing the screws. **[It should look like this.](http://i.imgur.com/mIqkaiN.jpg)** 
**3.** Unscrew the screws from the PCB and remove it from the metal casing.
**4.** Remove the speaker connections...sorry I forgot to take pictures of this step
**5.** Screw the PCB back into the little metal mounts in the casing.
**6.** If you want to go ahead and paint the metal bezels then remove **[these three screws](http://i.imgur.com/QS0oi2B.jpg)** and follow **videos 12 &amp; 13 in [this playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnVkA6ZcoQv5piavGXZDJv3Wj2E4MT_iE)** to see how to remove the metal bezel. The trim tools come in handy here. **[Bezel Painting Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmods/comments/1h0k8a/my_guide_to_painting_your_bezels_matte_black/)**.

**While the paint is drying on our bezel

**1.** Go to your local Home Depot/Lowes (or regional equivalent) and find 1/8"" Tempered Hardboard. You'll likely have to buy a huge 2""x4"" piece of it. Get them to cut it for you

**2.** Have them cut you a few squares to the dimensions of 9.75"" &amp; 9.375""  pieces (just in case you screw up).

**3.** If you're lucky enough, 4-40 Phillips 3/4"" Flathead Machine Screws (1/2"" work too) &amp; 4-40 Phillips Hex Nuts. These Phillips screws will connect our PCB Box + Metal covering plate + Tempered Hardboard all together. More on that later. You'll need **four** of each, M4 Metric Machine Screws &amp; M4 Metric Hex Nuts. These M4 screws are for connecting our VESA monitor mounts to the VESA connector on the back of the PCB box.

**4.** Take the **[flat metal covering plate](http://i.imgur.com/9MlALrZ.jpg)** and line it up against one of your spare 9.75"" &amp; 9.375"" square pieces of tempered hardboard. This will be our practice board. Grab a sharpie and mark the 6 screw holes. Grab your drill and a 5/32"" drill bit. We want to drill from the fibrous/rough side of the hardboard through to the smooth side, as this side of the hardboard will be what is placed against the metal back panel of the LCD.

**5.** Grab the actual PCB box (and your Phillips Hex Nuts) and screw everything together.

**[It will look like this](http://i.imgur.com/9XLX44c.jpg)**.

**[Reverse side](http://i.imgur.com/gWCL6D3.jpg)**.

**6.** Great

-----------------

**Connecting the PCB Box/VESA Mount to the LCD panel:**

**1.** Use a ruler to find exactly in the middle where the PCB box will go.

**2.** Outline a square the size of the PCB Box.

**3.** Grab your 60 Grit sandpaper and sand down the area inside the square. No need to get too crazy

**4.** Take a damp cloth and clean away as much debris/dust from sanding as possible.

**[Should look like this](http://i.imgur.com/B9mVtrM.jpg)**.


**5.** Tape up all of your cables onto the PCB box so they don't get in the way when we do our epoxy.

**[Cables taped](http://i.imgur.com/cyt8ckR.jpg)**.

**6.** Practice setting down your PCB box onto the outlined square so you don't screw it up when it matters later.
**7.** Get some disposable dishes and some sort of mixing utensil and squeeze out the entirety of both tubes of the JB Weld epoxy.

**[Epoxy 1](http://i.imgur.com/oEJ8uV2.jpg)**.

**[Epoxy 2](http://i.imgur.com/OPlVBl8.jpg)**.

**8.** Apply the epoxy evenly as possible within the square.

**[Epoxy applied](http://i.imgur.com/nDimap0.jpg)**.

**9.** Place your PCB box down firmly and remove the tape from the cables. Place something heavy on top of the PCB box. I used two bricks (that's what's in the plastic baggy - didn't wanna get brick dust everywhere) on top of a towel.

**[PCB Box placed](http://i.imgur.com/2zx32Wr.jpg)**.

**10.** Wait 48 hours for the epoxy to dry.

**11.** Take your Scotch 3M Mounting Tape and do like so over the back of the PCB box

**[Taped up](http://i.imgur.com/ZY9wz5c.jpg)**.

**12.** Take the black foamy stuff that came with your Qnix and cut some of it to mount the monitor controls on. Sorry I don't have a really good picture of this. The reason for doing this is that I think some kinda electrical issues occur when the little PCB board of the monitor controls touches the metal of the LCD panel. I could be wrong...but...just do it.

I did it like this:

**[Controls mounted](http://i.imgur.com/3QqP1qL.jpg)**.

**13.** Reseat all of your cables.

**14.** Grab your M4 Metric screws and attach the monitor to your VESA mount. Place the nuts on the screws first and then put them through your stand's VESA holes and then into the VESA mounting pegs on the back of the PCB. Sorry this isn't the greatest picture ever.

**[Rear view](http://i.imgur.com/McYMVkv.jpg)**.

**15.** Sit down and admire your work

* PSU: Corsair AX860W (Fully modular

* Mobo: ASUS M5A99X Evo R2.0 (likely will be upgrading to a better AM3+ board soon)

1364864203.0,1bhc92,Antec 900 - Adding a Third Front Fan,,6,1,5,"Hi r/pcmods


I am working on my first build. Like everyone else in the world


I am leaning towards the Antec 900 at the moment. I have seen some people alter the front of the case so that they have 3 120mm intake fans there instead of the 2 that come stock. 


Here's my situation:


I am only using  *one* 3.5"" internal hard drive. *My optical drive is external*


The ways I've seen this done are as follows:

1.) Using the bracket from the optional internal fan that is behind the HHD cages to mount a fan on the front.

2.) Using the bracket from the rear exhaust fan to mount a fan at the front and installing a new fan to replace the rear back exhaust fan

3.) Finding an Antec HDD drive cage with a fan in it and installing that.

The information/videos I have found on this are surprisingly vague. Maybe I'm just looking in the wrong places. Option 1.) Seems viable. I have read that optional internal fan on the Antec 900 doesn't do a whole lot and from an air flow perspective I think a 3rd fan at the front to send air through the case and out the exhaust makes more sense. I think my setup actually makes it easier to do because I'm not looking to put an optical drive in


Has anyone done this to their 900?


Sorry if this is convoluted! This is my first build and a very big part of me has no idea what I'm doing

(I also posted this in /r/buildapc)

I built my own laptop to an extent. MSI sells ""barebones"" laptops that come with the frame, battery, mobo, and GPU. I purchased and installed my own hard drives, RAM, and CPU. The one I have has an Nvidia GTX 570M videocard in it. It is a spectacular card for the price and fact that it is mobile.

The base clock for the GPU is 575MHz @ 850mV. I have overvolted it to 900mV and overclocked it 830MHz before artifacts appeared and eventually my computer crashed. I change the clock speed based on the games I play, it is possible to hit 90+ degrees, which is very, very bad for my laptop. Right now, I can't afford to get a new gaming computer, and I'm an enthusiast, so I want to push this laptop to see what I can do. I have concluded that I want to install my own custom liquid cooling.

I already have a laptop cooler underneath at all times when I'm gaming

I have purchased [this low profile water block](http://i.imgur.com/w4bkXAK.jpg) on Ebay ^[link](http://www.ebay.com/itm/New-Water-cooling-copper-Water-Block-water-cooler-Special-Price-Gift-/120989015383#vi-content) .

[This](http://i.imgur.com/DHtqrGw.jpg) is the inside of my computer.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/h9seXDK.png) is my plan for the water block and cooling setup. The block will be placed on top of the heatsink directly over the GPU core.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/dhfQwGZ.jpg) is a closeup of the heatsink.

I only have approximately 5mm of clearance between the bottom cover of my laptop and the heat spreaders on the heatsink. However, it will give me the extra few millimeters needed in order to not have to modify the bottom cover of my laptop.

I will drill two holes in the back of the laptop for the tubing to get out, and radiator/fan. This is where I need help. I don't know what to buy.

I know I need a pump and a radiator. And it needs to be powered by something. I was thinking something like [this simple pump](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Liquid-Cooling-System-Pump-PC-Water-Cooling-Circulation-Pump-12V-600L-hour-25dB-/190826770299?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item2c6e296f7b) with a super small reservoir built in (although I could buy a real reservoir if absolutely necessary) and a [cooling radiator](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Aluminum-Heat-Exchanger-Radiator-For-CPU-CO2-PC-Laser-Water-liquid-Cool-System-/151059918256?pt=US_Water_Cooling&amp;hash=item232bdf6db0) with a 120mm fan. Then I'll need to power all of this. I don't want to buy a full sized computer PSU

The only thing I have purchased so far is the water block.

**I know this is insane, and pump, that would be greatly appreciated. I am also completely clueless on what fittings and tubing I will need to purchase for this project.**

**Q1: is there some kind of a female 2pin LED to molex connector? what is that called? Amazon preferred.**  

I have LED strips that my dad got for me. They are white LED strips, there is such a thing as an RGB fan and RGB controller like NZXT Hue that can control everything all at once.

I plan on hooking these white strips up to the single 12 volt line that I have available on the built in fan controller. The LED strips my dad gave me will run on anything from 9-14 volts without needing heat sinks. I can run them in parallel and all I need to watch out for is too much current draw. i have no clue what kind of current draw these things use, all they need is DC 12 volts.

**Q2: I'm just wondering how much current this fan controller is capable of really putting out on the LED lines

**Q3: if anyone knows of a better white LED solution to light up the inside of this CM Storm Stryker that can connect to the stock fan controller's LED thing,,False,self,t5_2tj99,False,,True

Today I installed some custom lighting effect in my reservoir using 5mm leds

[Here is a video for you!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrP1OXDMGZE)


I noticed the turbulence which you can see at the video above. The hole there is the inlet to the reservoir and the reservoir is a quite small single bay reservoir. My pump is a jingway dp-600p (600 l/h). The rest if the loop is the standard radator and cpu block.
Is the turbulence you can see above the inlet normal or is my pump to strong for such a small reservoir causing the turbulence that decreases the pump performance or something. 

I also noticed the plastic film swaying wildly around in that turbulence could that be the cause of this? Is that plastic film even supposed to be there because that does not look normal at all!

I see lots of closed loop coolers crammed in this case for the cpu

My plan would be to mount a large triple rad on the outside (because I already have a triple rad) either on the front or back (probably need rad boxes to hold it away from the side of the case). Barbs would sit at the top and come through the top 120mm fan (no need for that fan).

I would then go from the rad to the cpu

From the video card I would add a T-line for filling

From the pump I would need to go back to the top to where the radiator barbs are.

My concerns are:

* clearance for full cover GPU blocks
* if running the video card blocks in parallel is going to be a problem if I overclock them and then run them hard for gaming
* where the pump will go and fit; I guess I could buy a smaller DDC3 pump.
* how this is going to look with a rad hanging off the side and how messy the inside is going to look if I put in a side window.

Does anyone have any opinions or thoughts about this? Can anyone find examples of anyone trying this type of cooling?

I gutted it this morning


I want to put all of my electronics in it.

That is, a set of lighted switches, a USB hub or two, a switch (so I only need one line for connectivity), basically whatever I can cram into this machine is going in. The particular parts aren't really too important to list, but the motherboards are an Intel DP55WG, with a single video card of low weight


The hard drive mounting system is intact, and they seem to fit consumer drives just fine. 

If you look at the first photo in the album, though, I would have to remount the door and lock in a different way. However, with the insane number of screws holding everything together, and the thick steel it is all made of, I can get away with a fair amount of ""trimming"" to fit things in. Lots of dremel work...

It has a key switch


Ideally I want to spend as little as possible - I'm making an unrelated and expensive purchase later today that I'll be paying off for months. Scrap metal should be easily had, etc. I have a fair number of fans, two cases I can cannibalize (plus a literally endless supply of generic office computer cases from each of my two workplaces.) 


Whatever tools I require are available.


Now


Can anyone offer me some advice on how to mount the motherboards and video cards securely


Aesthetics wise, which I took from the mainboard's power supply connectors. Advice is welcome here, as well.


I know cramming all my electronics into one box isn't exactly an ideal option for those electronics; I will work around any problems that come up

The general concept would be to flatten out all the parts in a plexiglass rectangle and nicely display them. The thickness would probably be based on the dimensions of the largest part which I would assume would be the PSU.


2 big snags I see for this mod is figuring out how to display the ram (extended away from the MoBo and placed next to it). Do ribbons for 240 DIMM exist? Looking online seemed fruitless. Someone on a forum pointed out that the added length could affect timing which I'm currently accepting as the reason for why these dont seem to exist. Which brings me to snag #2.

No way that anyone would call it slop. The frame is thick and the tool is heavy. The handles are a hard plastic, my smaller hands fit the tool perfectly. The ratcheting mechanism is satisfyingly crisp. There are Phillips head bolts holding the crimping heads firmly in place

This is German craftsmanship at it's finest!!

For those of you who don't know, it is evident! There are no rough edges or burrs, and no scratches in the finish. The feel is industrial, and I actually prefer this to the shiny chrome plated tools that are so prevalent in the American consumer tool sector... For those of you not in the EU, it's a bit tough to get the tool, as you have to hit the international website at certain times (the next open time is listed on the website). His reason (in his own words): 
&gt; Sure, earn more, begin to compromise on products and service, give my products to resellers etc. ...
&gt;... but turning MDPC into ""just another average company"" is not what I want! I am Nils

I love this attitude

When I finally got the tool in the mail (I ran into shipping mayhem due to Turkey day here in the States...), he drew a little picture! :D I can't say how much the little touches like this make me happy. The tool came in a plain white box, and came with test crimps from my tool in a little baggie. 

Again.. The little touches that are huge. 

The tool came with 60 crimps for fans, it's easy to see why people like it so much!! It's a bright and vibrant fluorescent orange. (Typing this, I set it on my back lit keyboard, and it reacts to the LED lighting by glowing. This makes me think it's UV reactive, and might look awesome in the right system...)

To sum this up, but I see no reason to doubt the claims on this tool.

From dotems
If your looking at the Sabertooth then you may want to consider putting in a little effort and just making a cover out of perspex yourself it would not be particularly difficult but you would want to do it properly then just paint it a mat black and you can use an motherboard you want, something I do completely understand and appreciate by the way. If you are willing to spend a bit more boards look absolutely amazing the MSI Big Bang Mpower boards look amazing for a black build and have no red which would look really nice with some more subtle red ram and other components.


I might actually do this, I would probably cover the final cut out persprex in a carbon fiber vinyl wrap or a matte black vinyl wrap.

The option I was thinking of are:

1) Run some tubes down to the basement and put the radiator

2) Very interested in this option.  I noticed my PC room is above the main water line coming into the basement. This gave me the idea of just branching off of my water main

 Build up - Would counter with putting a Reverse Osmosis system before the water heads upstairs. This would make the water distilled quality and since the water is clorinated organic things should not grow. 
 Pressure - The Reverse Osmosis would help with this some however a pressure reducer may still be needed as the water comes in at about 40 psi.
 Condensation - On hot humid summer days large amounts of condensation would form on the pipes and possibly inside the computer. 

Just wondering does this sound like a bad idea or does it actually make sense? Input would be great.
