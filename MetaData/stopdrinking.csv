1359471165.0,17hwpk,"For those struggling with the label ""alcoholic"" and if it applies to them.... ",strangesobriety,273,31,89,"An alcoholic is characterized by how they react to alcohol, or marriages they've ruined, or the amount of time they've been drinking

An alcoholic is someone who experiences a fundamentally different reaction to alcohol than your ""normal

This reaction to alcohol (and other mind altering drugs) is a fundamental part of the alcoholics mental and physical makeup. This phenomenon of craving does not disappear or fade over time. It doesn't go away if we go to detox or dry out for *X* number of days / weeks / months / years. It doesn't change if we switch up the type of booze we drink or the places we drink in or people we drink with. It doesn't go away if we start exercising or seeing a counselor or getting in touch with our inner feelings. It doesn't go away because we've finally gained the self knowledge to realize alcohol is causing us harm. The only defense we have against the power of the phenomenon of craving, one day at a time. By doing this, we are afforded a daily reprieve from the consequences booze has in store for us, and that's all we can ever ask for. 

If you think all alcoholics are skid row bums or regularly embark on Hunter S. Thompson style escapades

Minimization, because it speaks to you in your own voice and thoughts. Your best defense against these kinds of mental stumbling blocks is to get honest and familiar with your own story. This is one of the biggest reasons why people in AA tell their story again and again, even after years of sobriety. By taking a good, long, hard look at our established track record with drugs and alcohol, and then getting honest about it to another sober alcoholic, we learn more about ourselves than we ever would mulling it over in our own head. Because that's where my alcoholism lives - in my head, it will quickly manipulate and justify my history of drinking into a convincing argument for that most dangerous lie: *""I was never really that bad.""* If you have a proven track record of drugs and alcohol causing problems in your life, the progressive nature of alcoholism is sure to make all those *""but I haven't done _______ yet""*'s come true.

On my way there I see that the dog's food dish is empty.  I fill it up.  Then I get the TP and bring it back into the bathroom.  I put it on the roller.

Then, on her bed, looking kind of sad.  I pop in to give her a hug and find out what's bugging her.  She's having issues with a friend at school.  We talk about the best way to handle it.

The first one is the closest to my office. Right around the corner. Things cost a little more there

The second one is a little further away. I like to go there on the days when I actually have an appetite because there are a few restaurants. It's nice to already have the bottle as soon as I get off work so I can take a drink right away even though the other liquor store is not even five minutes away. Despite it all

I rarely stopped at the third place since I was often already set

I hadn't been to the fifth one in years until recently because it was one of those warehouse-type places. They didn't sell any cheap stuff, because I was in a hurry. The wife had to run a quick errand. I was out but I didn't think I'd enough have time to make it to my regular stores before she got back. It kind of felt normal to buy vodka in a glass bottle again. Not that it mattered since I immediately poured it into an old plastic bottle since those are much easier to hide. The same guy worked there. He remembered me after probably two years. I asked him if he'd been able to quit smoking yet. He hadn't.

The sixth one is my favorite. It's open 24/7 which I didn't even know was possible until I found it. Bottle empty at midnight? No worries.

I left not too long after she broke the engagement, I was been involved with a lot of women, and every one ended with me unceremoniously breaking up with them. More times than not, it involved my drinking, and the shame it would bring when I would say and do things that I didn't remember. Shame led to self-sabotage, which led to depression, anxiety and more drinking. I think somewhere in myself I wanted to hurt people the way I'd been hurt. No one was as good, or as funny as my ex

The last time I talked to her, all over, and my vision closed in on me. It was a visceral reaction I'd never had. I left, and never went back. I called her, demanded answers, stupidly, to which I of course wasn't entitled. I went home, and curled up in a fetal position on the floor

I didn't fall apart when I saw her, and how sorry I was that I'd been so shitty at the end, and how I wished I could have done it sooner. We hugged, and she left, and we were both very happy - in a very bittersweet, melancholy kind of way - that we'd run into each other. I felt like some kind of elephant in my emotional room had left. It was closure, I guess. 

Before I stopped drinking, and probably gone up to the bar and drank more, until the pain crept back in and I would come home and curl up on my bed and cry myself to sleep. But now, I'm facing these feelings sober. I'm not numbing the pain and regret. It still hurts. Hurts like hell. I regret so much. But I'm feeling it, deep in my gut, and I'm forced to face it. I'm forced to grow and learn. This, I realize now

I have a girlfriend now, or fool around with other women in a beer-induced haze. And I'm feeling everything, the pain, the regret, the self-sabotage, the mistakes. And I'm not, like exacerbating an injury by shooting it up with painkillers, it only puts off the inevitable.

There is something self-congratulatory about high-functioning alcoholics.  They believe they are a rare animal

Why are they invisible?  Because they're all dead.  Either that, or a detox ward.  Off the street.  You don't see them.  Until you join them, that is.

The myth of the high-functioning alcoholic is that alcohol isn't hurting them.  Many people even point to alcohol as having helped them in their lives.  This is not true, not because of it.  Imagine how much more they could accomplish if alcohol wasn't in control.

When I think of high-functioning alcoholics, but I could produce various contracts that would prove that I was very wealthy indeed.  

As a high-functioning alcoholic, I owned a lovely house, I had lots of friends, I had accomplished all my professional and personal goals by the time I was 30.  I could prove that I was very happy indeed, and in fact I frequently listed all these things to myself in an attempt to talk myself out of the horrible, crushing weight of the depression that had taken over my life.

Why was I so miserable?

Because that's what alcohol was really doing to me.  It wasn't helping me at all.  It was killing me.  Now that I've stopped drinking

Despite everything I accomplished, and that's why I'm functioning at a higher level than I ever have before.  I'll always be an alcoholic, and there's nothing I can do about that.

My body could not take it.  I was getting so sick. Puking all the time.  Losing weight. Hair falling out.  Sneaking bottles. Hiding from my husband.  So humiliating.  Reading on the Internet, always going back to Vodka.

Then I tried to stop once and for all. ""They"" said AA - 90 meetings in 90 days. I didn't believe in God. I figured since I went to college

I would feel so good with about 10, thinking if I could quit once I could quit again.  And AA just seemed so....goofy.  I was not religious.  I would switch meetings because I was embarrassed. I didn't want a ""sponsor."" or Steps. I wanted to do it my way, I would read the book, skip ""steps"" and do ""step four"" by myself and just wing it and sit in the back of the room.

* I have not done the work I was meant to do. I missed out on numerous  important networking and academic opportunities because I was drunk or nursing a hangover.  I turned up to a networking meeting still drunk - at 4pm. The person I met looked at me with an expression of slight disgust and bewilderment that I have never forgotten.   I once turned up to a seminar I was meant to teach still under the influence (the seminar was in the afternoon, it would have finished my teaching career.   I took a thermos flask of wine into the library with me and just drank while listening to Daft Punk. I would panic about having missed deadlines due to being drunk and then drink to mitigate the panic. The next day I would panic again and the cycle continued - for almost two years. 

* I accidentally left the oven on while drinking

* Towards the 'mid point' of my binging days (the high), buy two bottles of wine (one as back up - the horror of running out) and get drunk by myself, listen to music, and numb everything I felt and thought, then lie down on the bed with everything spinning slightly. It was glorious and it was my most favourite thing to do in the world.

* Towards the 'end', hated both it and myself.

* Suicidal thoughts and fantasies started to creep in. 

* The internal loop of my thoughts was constantly stuck on resentments towards others, and self-pity.

* If I was out with friends

* If I had an open bottle of wine

* I gained 20 pounds.

* From having a baby face

* I had to hide bottles under my bed and every month I would go out to an abandoned railway track and dump them. 

* If a housemate left alcohol in the house and they went away

* If I went home, and replace it when my parents were out. Sometimes I would fill things up with colouring and water and pray that no-one 'fancied a drop of wine/whiskey/whatever' before I had a chance to properly replace whatever was in it.

* Muslim man at cornershop looked at me with such concern when I was buying a bottle of gin at 11am and asked me if I was okay and looked as though he was going to refuse to sell it to me. Ran out of the shop and never went in again out of shame. (Also

* Housemate went away for a week. Drank around the clock while playing video games. On about the fourth night

* I got into debt. I spent stupid amount of money on things I didn't need. Oh

* I wet the bed on more than one occasion. If the memory of any of the above ever fails me

* I once accidentally drunk my own wee. 

* I tore a ligament in my arm from falling over something while drunk in my bedroom

* I would walk home from places instead of getting a cab
- once I started drinking







Suddenly become capable of moderated drinking? Whatevs.

He was the hardest working man I've  ever known. He would never miss work, and was always cleaning.  He would help anyone out who needed it free of charge. 

But around the age of 48 his habit of drinking 12-24 beers a day caught up with him.  He had 3 heart surgeries


He got himself together a little bit got another job (never quit drinking though), to 130 lbs,  and frail as they come within SIX MONTHS.  

I personally drove him to detox 3 times
He died within 3 months of saying that at the age of 52

It was and still is the  saddest day in my life. I went through his possessions, and clothes.  That was it.  He died eight years ago, and I still find myself crying over it. 

But this is what ""High Functioning"" will lead you to. It's not a badge of honor

It's funny my Dad spent so much time doing all this stuff around the house and for other people, he would say ""At least I go to work and x, y z"".  But he never realized that all of his personal relationships were sacrificed too, due to his time doing other things. I was by far the closest person to him, but we were never that close. Because he didn't know himself.  

I wanted to share this to show, or some dead beat.  You can function, but the cost of functioning like this will catch up with you, and it will cost you so much more than you know. 

Thank you

I have to say when I first got here I was nervous if I could stay sober. My whole family is here and much of what they do is centered around drinking. Also the fridge and coolers are packed with my favorite beer. 

I thought we'll hey you're on vacation you've gone this far what's the harm in drinking? I know it's wrong but for some reason I had to hear it from someone else and of course my Internet bestie came through. 

She reminded me you don't need alcohol to have fun especially at a beach house. And that I don't want to ruin my vacation with hangovers and regret

Having that happen, fighting those ruminations, helps me to stay sober. I know that a normal drinker doesn't think like that (IE I'm not a normal drinker).  They don't plan their day around drinking. They don't sit around telling themselves they can drink just one, they'll be able to control it.  This is my cornerstone reminder that I'm an alcoholic and alcohol will kill me.

I'm 39 years old.


New Years Eve, the same way I'd planned on quitting as a ""new years resolution"" the year before that, and the year before that, and the year before that before my son was born.


I'm standing in line at the store waiting to get my drink for the night, and for the briefest moment I realized as I had decided on getting a fifth instead of a pint (it's new years, after all) that it was never going to stop.  I knew I shouldn't be drinking that night.  Maybe my wife (who drinks maybe once or twice a year) would need a ride home, what if I had to go somewhere, or take my son somewhere, and I kept thinking to myself... ""it'll be fine, it's just one night..."" 


All of this is going through my head in the few moments while standing in line, my idiot brain would figure out a way around it.  As long as I could just get it home with me, I'd find a way to justify it to myself later.


That was my moment.  I was planning on quitting tomorrow anyway.  I looked down at my son, in the midst of all those people, it was my turn to step up in line at the counter and order and I decided at that moment, that just for tonight I wasn't going to drink.  I'll get shitfaced tomorrow and quit on the second, but tonight, this New Years Eve, I'm going to choose not to drink.  Not a resolution, not expecting anyone to pat me on the back for it


""Hey! Happy New Year, thanks.  Have a happy new year.""  and I carried my son out to the Jeep and we went home.


The night came and went.  The boy went down for bed around 8:30 like usual, for the first time actually sober on New Years Eve.  


I woke up the next day and looked in the mirror and I almost cried.  The amount of self-pride that the 'morning me' had that morning for the 'other me'... looking at myself in the mirror.  I know I said I'd get drunk tonight for not getting drunk last night


That was 66 days ago.  The bigger that number gets, for what?  A hangover?  ""But... it's just one drink, we don't have to get drunk, just have something small and call it good.  We've gone this long w/o drinking, clearly we have control over it.""  


 /sigh


I have had this conversation in my head so many times.  Some days I see this number being as high as 365 days


I was subbed to this subreddit for a long while and eventually began feeling so guilty that I couldn't quit that I unsubbed to get the voices out of my head and to cut the guilt

I started drinking when I was 16, but by the second year (age 19) I was a full blown alcoholic.  At that point in my life, school was just another obstacle inbetween my bottle and I, so I quit school, obviously.  

My life was literally wasted for the next 7 years.  My schedule everyday -- wake up (2pm if I didn't have to work), drink.  Then I would drive out to the bar if I could muster anybody to go with on a weeknight.  When I did have to work, the whole day was just a hungover haze. Every morning I would wake up and have nothing to be excited about.  Everyday was the same, and there was nothing I could do to change it, because I knew I would be drinking again very soon that day.  My life was groundhogs day.

People that say they only drove drunk the times they got caught are full of shit.  I drove drunk all the time.  I remember waking up in my bedroom wondering how the hell I got there.  I would have vague memories of the night before, hoping it wasn't in a ditch somewhere.  You know what too?  I have to where glasses, and I would misplace them all the time when drunk before I went to sleep.  I have horrible vision, so it is literally a fucking scavenger hunt the next morning trying to find them.  I bought thick black frames just to help me recognize them on the carpet (luckily they became fashionable a couple year later).

My first DUI was in 2004.  I don't remember being pulled over at all.  I do remember having to sit in the jail booking without a belt and my pants falling off trying to make phone calls (belts are weapons in jail).  Somehow I managed to get bonded out.  I found out that I had refused the breathalyzer, no big deal.  Everyone I knew and associated with had at least one DUI.  I got the lawyer, went to the classes before my sentencing, made a decent impression and got unsupervised probations for 2 years.  It was literally a slap on the wrist because immediately after my joke of a sentence I was at the bar, celebrating my lenient sentence!  

The alcohol treatment classes I was required to attend had absolutely no affect on me.  Why?  Because I didn't want to quit drinking.  Simple as that.  Fast forward another 4 years and I get my second DUI.  I remember this one a little more clearly.  Same thing, ""Hey, this is just my second DUI, no big deal.  I know tons of people with two DUI's.""  It was only when my lawyer had contacted me and informed my that I was being charged with felony DUI, and that I should prepare to go to prison for 2 years did it really sink in.  Two DUI's, and I was going to go to prison?  How could this be?  I never hurt anybody, and I knew a tons of people that had multiple DUI's.  My lawyer explained it like this, very high, and that told the judge a lot.

I couldn't deal with the prison thing.  Regardless, and he explained that I must quit drinking.  If I didn't not quit drinking there would be no help from the family.  As far as he was concerned, I would be dead to them.  It wasn't until a few years later that he explained to me, ""We always loved you, we just didn't fucking like you"", which made a lot of sense later on.

My first AA meeting was the day after my second DUI, I couldn't even imagine being locked up with a bunch of guys for 2 years.  I knew I had to attempt to kick this drinking thing.  Everything around me was crumbling down to the ground.  All of my friends were alcoholics, my parents wanted nothing to do with me, I had no education other than a year of college, and no decent job to speak of.  

My first AA meeting in a nutshell.  Get out of the car, immediately look at the ground and try not to make eye contact with anyone for the next hour.  This was my plan at least, and I followed through with what I could, but those damn people wouldn't leave me alone!  They gave me some coin, kept telling me I didn't have to feel the way I felt anymore, and kept saying that just my presence was helping them stay sober.  I thought these people were crazy, but I was willing to take crazy to quit drinking.  The one thing I do remember from that meeting was someone saying, all you have to do is stop digging.""  That hit the spot, all I had to do was make it to the next day so I could go to another meeting.  Oh

So I kept going back.  I went 5 days a week in fact, when I could help so many people here in the meetings!  Wow, self-centeredness was coming back in a big way.  Luckily, the sentencing went really well.  I was charged with a felony, but given everything I had done between the charge and the sentencing I was only sentenced to 90 days in county jail, with a 7 year probationary tail of course (hah).  The judge made it abundantly clear that this was my last chance.  If she ever saw me again, I would be going straight to prison no questions asked.  I took that seriously this time

So, come out and be ready to take on the world.  Nope, nope it didn't work that way.  Jail actually cost me a lot of money.  But it was benificial.  You see, I was an isolated drinker.  The majority of the time I would just sit in my house with a few bottles, watch TV, and feel sorry for myself.  This consumed quite a few years of my life.  So going to jail was actually pretty damn exciting.  It was almost like a summer camp for me.  It really opened me up, I was making friends, but I really started liking Russian literature (War and Peace, and it was a good time to reflect and try to figure out what I was really supposed to be doing with my life

They told me, so one year?  No problem...  I met my wife 13.5 months after I sobered up (hahah).  We went on one date and I knew I had to marry this woman.  She didn't even drink!  Me, with someone that doesn't even drink!  Have the stars aligned?  How is this possible?  She's my safety net.  I know if I have 1 drop of alcohol, the only thing I will see is the door slam because she'd be gone so fast you wouldn't even notice.  I love her even more for that.

Throughout the past four years I have made a lot of great friends in the program.  I made a lot of great friends outside of the program too, the phone calls stopped.  If you're a drinker, you hang out with drinkers, that just how it is.  Nothing is more of a bummer than being a drunk and trying to hangout with someone who doesn't drink.  So that worked out in my favor.  I got married 1.5 years into my relationship with my wife.  Best day of my life.  She was trapped now.  :)  

So now I had a family.  Still in a shitty job.  What do do?  School.  This time I had the tools to do it right.  I never miss a class (unless its to work on another class.. strange how that works out sometimes)

Look at it through my point of view.  I haven't had a drink for four years.  Thats the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.  Every other goal I set for myself is just frosting on the cake.  Nothing I ever do in my life will even be a modicum as difficult as not drinking.  Sure, but I still remember it.  I still watch movies and tv shows of people having good times while drinking.  I just came to the realization that I abused that privilege -- forever.  I've drank enough in my life to kill whole populations of towns in North Dakota and adjacent states.  I've had enough.  Nothing -- let me repeat that -- nothing will ever be as difficult for me than not having that first drink.  But I don't have that first drink, and so the cycle has stopped.  

Getting back into school was another journey in and of itself.  My state university wasn't so hip about giving me financial aid again after my first attempt (7 years previously, wrote tons of letters, begged, stole, and borrowed (ok not stole) and as I write this its 1am my time and I just finished up a take-home number theory / abstract algebra exam.  It takes a lot of work, but I put the time in because everything I do that makes me a better person, puts distance between me and the person I was only 4 short years ago.   

So this already looks like a big ramble from some dude, but I won't submit you guys to that.

Here is my message to the new people.  Don't drink.  Do everything you can possibly do in your power (and others power) not to drink.  Go to meetings, and make some damn friends!  My closest friend is a guy I met in AA, and even though he doesn't live near me anymore, he will always be the best friend I have.  Don't look at every superbowl you're going to miss out on by not drinking, don't look at all the holidays you will, ""not have a good time at"", because you'll be surrounded by drink

- NO HANGOVERS!
- No worrying about making an ass of myself
- Been writing more
- Spend more time reading
- Have more energy
- Can stay awake later
- Can play through a videogame now without passing out drunk 
- Working harder
- Met amazing support network of friends through AA
- Discovered the joys of homemade iced tea
- Have saved money
- Less procrastinating
- More confident
- Closer to my wife
- Marriage improved dramatically
- Feel more emotionally
- Have renewed hope for future

2.  I just kept thinking about H.A.L.T.: Hungry, Tired.  All common reasons that we turn to alcohol.  Last night was one of the first nights that I could clearly identify one of those things and actually made the wiser choice to go straight home.

On the ride home,* lonely, tired.""  And holy shit it actually worked.

I'm no psychologist, but I was really impressed with that simple idea and I'll use it again, for sure.

I used to deliberately get drunk at social situations

The worst that ever happened would be telling someone a boring or embarrassing story

I often see posts how sobriety _prevents_ people from being dumb socially. It does

**You've still got it all within you**. 

With a sober mind

 - Being just a bit bolder in my conversations. A guy about my age standing to the side? Why not walk up to him and ask what he thinks of the original Super Mario Brothers. 

 - Dancing. This one was tough. I am _not_ a dancer

 - Being bolder with women. Just go up and talk to them. Say hello. Make a dumb joke. Again

I found that all those ""beneficial"" parts of being drunk were just parts of my own personality that I didn't know how to exercise. And it's so much better and awesome to know that I've really got it while sober. 

I even had that feeling the day after ""Oh God. What did I do last night? Did so-and-so get angry at me?"". But then I remembered that I was sober

The next day I made an appointment for a brain MRI to see if I had epileptic characteristics. I never had any epileptic attacks ever and never had a seizure either. On the brain scan was no evidence to be found about epilepsy but they told me that many people have a one-time epileptic attack and this would probably be what happened. The same day I started thinking and reading about seizures happening from alcohol withdrawal and came to the realization that this is what must have happened. Especially because I never had seizures ever in my life (I'm 32).

I made an appointment with a neurologist to look into it deeper. I went cold turkey because the chances of seizure were low and because I never considered myself physically dependent on alcohol. Now I know that it's more serious than I thought and I'm going to do exactly what the neurologists advises.

1344083428.0,xo2wt,6 reasons to quit before rock bottom (wall of text warning),Ambivalent_Fanatic,87,13,17,"**6 Reasons To Quit Before Rock Bottom**


This is especially for all you younger lurkers out there who aren't sure if you have a problem or not


Let's say you're in your teens or early twenties.  You like to drink.  A lot.  It's fun, maybe you've embarrassed yourself in public, but all in all your life is pretty much on track and you haven't suffered any major consequences.  Sometimes, after a big night, you think you might be overdoing it, and you suspect your life would be better if you stopped.  But you're still young, you have tons of energy


So why stop now?


1.  **Because you're waiting for something really bad to happen to force you to quit.**  Think about this for a minute.  What is your price for quitting?  A failed relationship?  A DUI?  A spell in jail?  Losing a job?  Killing someone?  What would it take to convince you that you need to quit?  If you are waiting for something this bad to happen before quitting


2.  **Because if you think you have a problem with alcohol, then thinking I don't have an alcohol problem means I don't.""*  The answer here is:  normal drinkers don't have to play head games with themselves to justify drinking.  If you catch yourself doing this, you very well might be an alcoholic.  


3.  **Because alcoholism ALWAYS gets worse.  It NEVER gets better.**  If your drinking is heavy now


4.  **I'm not living in a cardboard box in an alley, and to instead adopt our own definition.  This is empowering.  It makes you stronger.  It means you are taking control of your life.  You wouldn't let society define what kind of music you listen to, what kind of clothes you wear, what kind of relationships to have, or what kind of job to take.  So why let it define how much you drink?


5.  **I hate the hysteria around alcoholism.  I like to drink.  I like to have fun.  What's wrong with that?**  I used to feel this way too.  Just because I liked to get drunk sometimes didn't mean I needed to use the nuclear option, and I was forty years old, with more than 20 years of hard boozing under my belt, a lot of failed relationships, a lot of missed career opportunities, fifty extra pounds, and a very guilty conscience.  You don't have to be hysterically anti-alcohol to quit drinking.  You just need to decide to take control of your life.


6.  **OK, so I don't think I'm an alcoholic.  But I always get the urge to drink again.  It's okay now, right?**  Ask yourself this.  Can you have one drink and then stop?  Be honest with yourself.  There is a big difference between having one beer because you feel like it, and feeling an overwhelming urge to chuck everything to the wind and get loaded.  If the latter is the case… it's time to get honest with yourself.  Alcohol is an issue for you.  And that issue will only grow with time.

I've drunk heavily since about 1998, and ever more recently, I've become very conscious that I'm not in control of my drinking and that this is a downward spiral. Every day I wake up hating night me for making morning me feel so bad, and I resolve to give it a rest tonight. But by 3 or 4 pm, the alcoholic voice has won, and I'm figuring out the best way of getting more alcohol for tonight. I began hiding it from my wife, disposing of empty bottles in secret and pretending I'm still only on the first or second bottle of wine. Recently I've been more and more conscious of just how much worse it had got, and how hard it was. I can't remember the last day I had a rest from drink

Despite hiding it well (I think?) my wife and son deserve better. He deserves a dad who can run around with him all day and doesnt have a reputation for liking his drink. She doesnt deserve the me who's ~40lb fatter than when we met. She doesn't deserved my laziness in the mornings after a particularly heavy night. They both deserve the £3k + per year I spend on drink. And She deserves a husband who isn't permanently under the influence. On Friday something was taken away from her that completely broke her heart again

Friday was my first day without alcohol, it has to be all or nothing. Whilst all the inspiration of our loss is fresh, and helping, I know the journey ahead is going to be tough. I'm reading Allen Carr for some additional assistance, and I'll sticks round here for more inspiration. Those posts about that schizophrenic feeling of the alcoholic voice and your true self have really rung true with me, and they make me feel like I'm in the right place.

I gave up feeling sorry for myself for circumstances that happened years ago and were beyond my control. I stopped blaming myself for getting caught in an alcoholic web that I couldn't imagine freeing myself from. I didn't want to. Even though I suffered greatly during the day with hangovers

I drank that evening in November. I drank and drank like every other night until I didn't hurt anymore. The next morning I didn't partake in a bit of Breakfast vodka. I skipped the bar for lunch and I let the evening pass me by naturally. I didn't go to detox

I think everyone has to take their own path to sobriety. We all got to that point from a different path and I think we all need to take a different path out of it. It's hard to do. It's painful to relearn to deal with raw emotions and feelings again. It feels unnatural to pass by the liquor store and to be sober all the time but it's so so truly worth it. I want to share with everyone the day I stopped drinking and what I look like today. Happier

Thinking about what I've done differently the last time


* I told most of my friends and family I was going to quit drinking. I didn't admit to being an alcoholic to everyone

* All of a sudden I had developed polyneuropathy (numbness and tingling sensation in my hands and feet). It scared the crap out of me and even though I continued to drink for a while

* I had intense cravings in the evenings for the first few weeks. Drinking had always been my reward for a hard day


So with these 5 months of sobriety behind me and many more such months before me


The Good:


* I'm becoming myself again. I'm slowly learning to enjoy my life without the need for alcohol.

* Just the thought that I finally managed to quit makes me happy every single day.

* My polyneuropathy has all but disappeared.

* Though my personal life is far from perfect right now

* I can drink beer all day long without a guilty conscience. I'm talking about alcohol-free beer of course. (It doesn't make me relapse

* I'm a regular at the gym now and I don't think I've ever felt fitter in my life. I get compliments too. Feels good man.


The Bad:


* I can't drink anymore in social situations. I'm a very outgoing guy, I try to be careful.)

* Long-term alcoholism has a certain effect on your brain's reward center

* In my experience, friends and family accepted it, a few complained, others laughed, some encouraged me, but since I don't know any other alcoholics I never felt like someone had an actual idea about what I was going through and how much it meant to me.


The Ugly:


* Withdrawal symptoms. Fuck them. The first few sober days were the worst I've ever felt in my life. I wouldn't do it on my own again given the choice - _please be safe and see a doctor if you want to stop_. I saw a neurologist a few weeks later and she had a hard time believing I even managed to stop on my own given the amount I was used to drinking.

* I've been suffering from anxiety disorder for years and it turns out I was actually self-medicating with alcohol. My anxiety has returned with a vengeance after I stopped drinking. I'm on proper meds now again and slowly getting better.

* My polyneuropathy has all but disappeared - I listed this as Good because it certainly is

* Drinking heavily for so long has definitely had a negative effect on my brain. I tend to misspell words when typing (something I never used to do)


Anyway, also I'm not a native English speaker. ;)

I believe that happiness is the whole point of recovering.  There were times in my recovery when I was miserable.  I was doing it all wrong.  I was afraid to ask for help.  I didn't want to reach out to other alcoholics.  I wanted to be lazy and do things my way.  My way and my hair brained ideas tend to not work.  My brain is what got me into this situation in the first place.

I have discovered that when I am miserable in sobriety I AM DOING IT WRONG. 

For me, to be honest, I did not believe sobriety would give me.

My advice to newcomers is to reach out and ask for help.  YOU ARE NOT ALONE.  Find yourselves some sort of program and a sober network.  Use it.  Throw yourself at it with the reckless abandon that we used to use when throwing ourselves at alcohol.  The results can be astonishing.  Honesty

I was a drunk; a homeless, I had turned into a lost, drifting loner. Emotionally vacant and physically dying. I was a shell of a human. I lost my ability to make eye contact with anything besides the pavement. My last thoughts before passing out at night were “God, please don’t make me wake up. Please.”
One cold rainy day, but I was nearing a black out. I did tear up while there though. I remember being sad because all these people were happy and sober, and those were two things so far from my reach. I felt like I was too far gone. Along with a phone list, a woman there gave me a number to a local treatment center. A few weeks later I managed to go in for an assessment. And soon enough I was on a bus to a detox facility then right to an inpatient facility. I spent 6 months there. I graduated December 28th 2012. 
Today I go to meetings 3 times a week. I work a program. I work at a coffee shop! I’m going to school to finish my bachelor’s degree in mathematics (wtf right??!). I walk with my head held high. I volunteer. My skin is no longer marked with a yellow tint. My liver doesn’t throb every morning. My face isn’t bloated. I look like me again! I am typing this in my pajamas, but I have never had these luxuries and I wouldn’t have gotten them without being sober. It all didn’t happen at once, I had to chip away at it… But my life is back on track and better than ever!
I am so damn grateful for every breath. I am grateful that I listened to those who told me that a life in sobriety is possible and worth it. I am grateful for all the support I have found within the recovery community. I am grateful for my new found self-esteem and self-worth.

It feels absolutely great. I remember making it about 4 months last year before I caved, when I’m feeling brave, to say hello to a beautiful woman. Yet I don’t drink there. Even the bartenders get annoyed with me sometimes for being that guy that always gets water, but I could care less (tell them you're the DD, and they'll stfu.) There are even a few beers in my fridge right now that I have no desire to drink that a friend left last time he was here. Another friend of mine recently asked me about this, asking me if I should get rid of them as to not “tempt me”. I laughed. I told her beer and alcohol in general isn’t a temptation at all anymore. I am completely and 100% not tempted to drink in any way whatsoever. And that’s an awesome thing to be able to say.

The truth is, I never want to become that terrible person I become when I drink, that I *absolutely have no fucking desire to pick that back up.*

The differences between my life when I drank alcohol and now are many, haha), and I already miss him like crazy. But we have some great plans in a year from now, and the crazy thing is that I know **as long as I don’t drink, I’ll probably reach those plans**. I can plan for the future now, and look forward to it. I didn’t have that before. I mean, I would plan for the future and stuff of course, foolish

I've also found my health and confidence rising dramatically. For the first 2-3 months my confidence was shot without alcohol. There was no way I could talk to that girl at the bar without getting a few shots first. But just recently I worked up the nerve to stand up and walk over to a table with 3 beautiful girls, I'm working out, eating better, trying to gain weight (too skinny) and actually focusing on stuff I never cared about before. Maybe it's because I don't drink so I need to fill my time with more things, but it's working.

The only advice I really have for anyone else struggling is to just not let yourself talk yourself into it. Your own mind can play tricks on you. Your own mind knows better than anyone else in the whole world how to get you to do something. And you can't fight with it. You have to just tune it out. You can't reason against your own mind. I'm not tempted by alcohol at all in and of itself, *really* good at tuning my own mind out.

The bottom line is I feel we were all put on this planet to be excellent to one another, not act like a big bunch of jerks.), and I’m physically healthier.

There have been tests. I confronted a group of friends by expressing regret for my drunk behavior on New Year’s Eve. I explained to them that I gave up drinking. It was really awkward

There have been social gatherings, but my craving passed quickly in the excitement and fun to be had at the party.

The biggest test popped up about a week ago. The only time I really contemplated going to the liquor store for a bottle arose last Friday, it’s treatable. My dad’s fighting spirit is strong and he’s ready to win. We live a 12-hour drive apart, but we spent a great deal of time on the phone last weekend, and I could not have done it had I been drunk.

1) **It's a great substitute for habitual drinking.** One of the biggest problems I had was figuring out what to drink instead of drinking. Whether it was at night, but too much of it will make you crazy. Drink as much fucking tea as you want--I won't bother you that much. 

2) **It will help you loose weight** another substitute is soda--which is a safe alternative, drinking tea constantly has flush many elements out of my system--I've lost 25 pounds. 

3) **It's incredibly inexpensive** A case of soda--damn too much (of course, long time. To fill in this habitual gap cost next to nothing. 

4) **No more dehydration** one of the biggest problems I had while drinking was being dehydrated. Whenever I drank I had a huge headache (no a hangover) and it was due to having little water. Whenever I came home and had a beer, I'm wide awake at night and get more work done. 

5) **I feel safe overindulging** I think this is the best reason. I will have several (and I mean giant mugs of hot tea) each night to quench my palette. And that's all right. With other methods to eliminate the habit

I kept kidding myself because I was drinking wine or champagne, go to work, get my job done, and hey, I was great at what I do! I didn't need a drink, I just LIKED to drink. So how does that make me an alcoholic?  

Turns out the reason I quit was that I began verbally abusing my spouse. Of course, not remembering what happened, but you know in the pit of your stomach that *something* happened because for some reason a feeling of shame comes over you. A feeling of guilt.
 
My spouse gave me ""the talk"" informing me of my behavior.  Needless to say I felt sick to my stomach.  Twenty two years of marriage and I was NOT going to ruin it.  That was on Sept. 12, than I was giving him.  

My brother was an alcoholic.  A doctor, there I was, walking down the same path.  Thank god for my spouse.  Did I say that already?  Good because it should be said over and over again.

My adult life has been one of extraordinary good fortune: some hard work, healthy, and happy woman with wonderful children and a devoted spouse. It would also show me pulling the languid shadow of alcohol.

There is no rock bottom moment to report. There are no car crashes, trivial to the world, but adding up to an inexorable sense of futility that made me choose recovery: telling my son that I would love to read a book with him, but “Let me get a glass of wine, and then we’ll sit down together.” Telling my spouse a story about something that happened at work and hearing him reply, “Don’t you remember? You told me that last night.” Trying to squeeze into a snug suit and having a breakfast of Tylenol and coffee before heading to work. Waking up in the middle of the night and wondering, “Why am I doing this? Why did I do it again? Is there something wrong with me? Do I have a problem? Am I a bad person?” Resolving to improve only to rehash the same anxious, and watching the level in the wine bottle go down, whether it will be noticed that I take the last from the bottle before anyone else gets to it. It culminates with an ordinary morning where I wake up

Many stories include how much the person’s life has improved since they chose recovery. My story has no mended fences, and see a flock of birds traverse the sky above me. The sunlight on my daughter’s hair. The genuine smile and laughter that I can produce at work in the morning. Waking up in the middle of the night, inching closer to my beloved, and falling back asleep. The feeling that my life, my ordinary life, is rich and beautiful, and I am experiencing [I]all[/I] of it.

I felt repulsed by the lack of ambition and fatalism that I saw in most people that I met in AA.

I did meet some really remarkable people and people that I genuinely admire. I'd put the number at less that 5% - about the same number of decent priests that I have met. But AA is/was not for me and I stopped going to meetings after 10 years. That was 8 years ago and I haven't really looked back.

I've since lost the 15 lbs and dropped about 5% body fat, and began running 20 kms a week and hitting the gym 3 times per week. My body is starting to noticeably change now, can see a 6 pack coming in slowly and lost the beer gut, which is awesome to see (never had one before

I guess the biggest thing for me now 6 months on in is I'd initially thought my life would somehow be magically all better at this point, I have my self confidence back and feel like my old self who I seem to have lost somewhere in my teenage years (almost 30 now). According to a therapist I was seeing for a bit I was self medicating for a long time, and was diagnosed with depression and anxiety from my doctor. I've been taking an SSRI which has helped a lot, planning on stopping that within the next few months. It initially cut down my cravings to drink tremendously, which is obviously personal experience only. 

If you're still reading this thank you, nor fun at times, but it's possible. 

Best.

TL; DR 6 months sober tomorrow.

If you asked me a year ago what I thought about people who didn't drink, they can't be as intelligent as I am.  If they knew what the world was really like, they'd have to drink.""  I didn't know shit back then, I still don't today.  I do know that thinking like that is an excuse.

I lived in absolute fear since for the past 5 years.  Fear that I febreezed over with vodka.  When the vodka wore off, then the more often I'd drink.  I really started to scare myself when I was drinking in the morning before work.  That fear followed me to the office, where I feared everyone could smell me from a mile away(brought tons of mints/gum). 

I'm sure most of you have heard these stories a hundred times over:

I have no idea how I still have a driver license, infront of family, and said horrible things about my friends to their faces.  Blacked out while ON the shift at an old bartending gig, and was noticeably drunk while working numerous other places(mostly food service industry).  Again, this is all on a daily basis.  Lastly, ruined a 3 year relationship with someone I loved.  She got to see the wholeeeee thing.  Lucky her.

365 Day Later... 

At 26 years old

I'm 22lbs lighter and my max benchpress has gone up by almost 100lbs.  I got REALLY into fitness

I've just started dating again.  It all feels brand new without the chemical relaxant.  I can tell you without a doubt that not drinking decreases maximum potential dates, which can be easily read by the person you are out with.  Practice.

I know I was self medicating with my drinking.  I thought not drinking would solve the problems I was self medicating for.  What I didn't know, and reading it as if it weren't my own words, I feel that I'd say to the writer  ""Congratulations, sounds like your doing great!""  I don't know why that is so hard to do for yourself.  

I realize now that there is still a lot of work to be done

For some reason 11 years feels like a bigger milestone for me than 10. I think because when I hit 10 it almost sounded like something was over. Now that it has been 11 years I feel like I have settled into a tranquil pace that I can keep up till the end. I remain vigilant

Life certainly has not gotten any easier. On the contrary, and am going to start the path of alcohol or addiction counseling, as I feel I have something to offer.
However, I can step back, think and evaluate what I am doing, and try a different angle. Before, I would just quit and retreat and sink further into depression. The deeper into depression I went, I would not even try to accomplish anything, and felt like I was drowning. Now, but I can move forward confidently and change course or tactics with a mind not obsessed with cursing itself.

To the new people and people just wondering if they have a problem: Drinking or quitting drinking will not solve any of your problems. Sometimes the problems will even seem greater after quitting, if you are drinking to avoid your problems, eventually you will be run over by them, and you may not recover. By not drinking I know that I at least can have a clear mind to face life. 

The other important factor I want to mention is that just quitting drinking is only part of being sober. If you do not change your behavior and mindset, changing your behavior, and loving yourself. Eventually your will start to notice more and more the enjoyment you get out of life, and you will be less afraid of feeling sad.

I am 28 years old and have been sober for a little over 14 months. I attend AA meetings roughly every day

For the sake of transparency, I certainly drank alcoholically. The last time I went more than a few days without a drink (before this sober run), I was like 16 years old. More importantly, when I drank, the feeling of being drunk created a craving for more booze. Once I got a couple in me, I was shooting the moon basically every time. I also smoked pot every single day, all day, and developed some serious habits with several of them. 

I built an identity and lifestyle for myself that served to keep drugs and alcohol within arms reach at all times. I was proud to be the guy who knew everything about drugs and was not afraid of any of them. I was proud to be the guy many other people came to for information about drugs. I grew up wanting to be the cool guy

At the end of my last run, I had thoroughly lied to in order to keep them in my life; I was lonely; I was absolutely out of control; I was failing at everything in my life except getting fucked up. I ultimately got sober when I started to fail at getting fucked up too. The final feeling of my time drinking and drugging was terror. I was absolutely terrified that I wanted nothing more than to stop doing what I was doing, but found myself completely unable to stop. Every stopping attempt I had attempted had fallen flat in a matter of minutes to days. I was trapped. The only outlet I could imagine was death, but I didn't have the balls to end my own life. 

It was in that state that I surrendered. I walked out on the life I had built on a foundation of drugs and delusions. I moved back in with my parents at the age of 27. I entered an outpatient treatment program and began attending AA meetings. I went to 90 meetings in my first 90 days. I got a sponsor. I became willing and eager to work the steps very quickly. Meetings gave me a feeling of peace from the maelstrom going on in my head. I also rode my bike a lot. That made me feel better too. 

I worked the steps with all the diligence I could muster. Step 3 was a bit of a mystery to me

Honestly

Step 9 was tough. Fortunately I had built a pretty strong emotional foundation in steps 1-8. So even though step 9 was very emotionally turbulent for me

Today

So real quick before I jet out the door:

My life is wonderful today. I live almost every day in feelings of gratitude and peace. The moments when I have difficulty and that serenity breaks down

If I can experience this change

I hid my drinking quite well. My wife didn't know, there is now a problem of trust in our relationship, which I fully understand and accept. She said it felt like she was hit by a truck when I told her. When I was drinking, it didn't feel like lying. It was just me having some drinks. Nothing to tell. But, looking back with sober eyes, I realize that she is right. I lied. A lot. About what I was doing. About where money was going. And, perhaps most importantly

What started as me getting help for a problem has turned into serious introspection about who I am. I always thought I was honest. I always thought I was considerate of others needs. But my actions say otherwise. 

Thankfully, or really even get mad. She is hurt, which pains me to see. I did that to her, and I have to accept that.

I'm two weeks sober now, this will be the past, and we will have moved on. But for now, I am stuck with the unsettling fact that I have no idea who I am. The unintended consequences of a life that I let get away from me.

**edit: some people have asked me to share how it works for me. If this doesn't sound anything like your sobriety

I began recovery by making 90 AA meetings in 90 days. Every now and then I would miss a day, but I decided AA was the best choice for my recovery for a few reasons which I won't write here, but will gladly share if you ask.

I should add

With some nudging from my outpatient program I got a sponsor. He was just basically the only guy in the meetings I had been going to who had reached out to me. I had made almost zero use of the phone numbers I had received in AA, let alone on such an intimate level. He is an absolute role model to me. 

I knew that I wanted to work the steps. I considered myself a believer-in-god already and had no qualms or difficulties surrounding prayer or faith (though I had never really engaged in either before). My sponsor and I talked about the first three steps for maybe a month, and around my 6th month, I shared it with my sponsor over the course of a couple 5th step sessions. My 4th step was eye-opening and enlightening, not nearly as scary as I had made it out to be in my head. There were a small handful of things that I was scared to share with my sponsor. But when I sat with him to do my 5th step, I shared them anyway telling myself that if I wanted to run away and never see him again, I could. It ended up being just fine, though not earth shattering

At this point

My 8th step was not difficult. I had done a lot of pre-writing for it in my 4th step. Though

I started working my 9th step in no particular order. I had been afraid of the 9th step since step 1, but in order to heal them, you have to slash them with a knife. the slash will hurt, and the puss inside will be smelly and festering. but then they will heal. 

Sometime during the 9th step, and 12th steps started to naturally pop up into my life without much effort or thought. I had made a habit out of daily prayer, but it started to sound a lot like a 10th step prayer. I had immersed myself in ideas about God, myself, and other people, so I was (and still am) intensely curious about God. So daily meditation became a natural part of my life just because I yearned for a deeper connection with God. And I quickly came to believe that my highest calling in life is to help ease the suffering of myself and other people on a moment-to-moment basis however possible. 

I cannot express how rewarding the beginning of my journey into recovery has been. The gifts I have received in this process have exceeded my wildest dreams. I hope and pray that this experience touches you and your life as well. And I can't wait to find what will be revealed next.

8 months of the hardest drinking in my life later, but his death impacted me more than any pep-talk ever could. He was always an asshole; and I really do mean always, so at least his death lit that fire under my ass.

This time however, I avoided them and told myself I could just spark one up instead. Lots of people on this subreddit warned me that it would just bring back old urges, and even though I didn't want to, I heeded that warning and put the bong away for a few months just to see if I had cravings for weed. I didn't. I really didn't.

So I started with weed again, and at least vaporizing weed was going to have the most minimal affect on my health (at least compared to anything else I could think of.) I know some might think less of me for it, and might even think I don't deserve my badge, but hear me out.

This whole passed year hasn't been about stressing out about liquor, but I just don't see that happening. I have had cravings for alcohol maybe 20-30 times in the passed year. Now, we all know that sounds like a lot to the layman, but really, before weed, it was like 20-30 a day.

So if I am being completely honest with myself, I don't feel like the coolest guy in the world, not having that self control and all to just quit cold turkey. Either way, I can at least say with full certainty that I am much happier now than I ever was with booze. At least that victory will always ring out.

Some awesome victories of mine last year:
I sat at BJ's brewery

Went to a friend's house who always has parties and didn't drink at all. I was the life of the party as a drunk

Went to an old friends house and he tried and tried and tried to talk me into doing shots. Didn't even get close to talking me into it.

About 500 days ago I stopped drinking. This is, the drinking is sort of a big part of that title. Both of those are very big reasons why I should not be sitting at home, while my wife is at work for another 4 hours, sober as a church mouse. I should be through a 6 pack + maybe a glass of scotch at this point, which plenty of time left to drink another 4-5 beers and hide the evidence. She'll get home, I'll be showered and ""tired,"" I'll pass out and she'll swallow her fear and disappointment because if she talks to me about my very obvious problem I'll lash out and play dirty.

500 days ago we had a party, kicked everyone out, ran out into the night and just walked around shitfaced for a few hours. I had been drunk every day for the previous 3.5 years, and before that I was just having the ole' college experience. My day-drinking had gotten to the point where the day was just getting in the way of my drinking. I'd drink while I wrote stuff for work (affectionately thinking of myself as some sort of Hemingway instead of the actual Lohan I had become), and in general I was in that slow decline where I was going to eventually lay everything I love, everything, one-at-a-time at the foot of the alter of Booze. I drank because I was nervous, I was bored, it helped take my mind off things

500 days ago, so I lied to her and told her I had been drinking a 6-pack a night and I saw her become really scared. And then I became really scared because what if I had told her that it had been double that on weekdays and who knows on weekends. I went to AA the next night and cried at my first meeting while sitting in the back row, sweating like crazy. 

Sobriety seems/seemed like an impossible goal. But every day that you get from those dark, why did I think I had to get black out drunk to face the day? I was so fucking scared of getting sober, but as cliche as it sounds, I'm doing it one day at a time. I've accomplished things in the past 500 days that would have been impossible if I had been drinking. For folks that are still a little wet and thinking about quitting- you can too! Imagine not being ashamed anymore- it's possible!Yes, you'll save money and lose weight and you'll finally realize how shit Jay Leno when viewed in a clear light- but all those things are secondary to the freedom sobriety brings.

I have seen several people over the past year post their story when they hit a major milestone in their recovery (6 mos, it’s actually pretty simple in my opinion: I have basically done everything I can to isolate myself from the people and places that kept me drinking.  No bars, no more bar friends.  Changing those two things was quite difficult on me and I still honestly to this day miss the social aspect of drinking.  However, when I had failed sobriety attempts in the past I had initially started out very well with great intentions.  I marveled at how much better I felt, how much more money I had, etc… We all know what the benefits are.  Each time I eventually made the mistake after a period of feeling better to try to reintroduce alcohol to my life in a controlled manner.  At first I tried to go to the bar just to hang out and drink some water and socialize with my friends.  Then I had a drink or two and then after a while I spun back out of control.  I see a lot of people around /r/stopdrinking that seem to flirt with this line and I always have a lot of concern when I see posts around here saying something to the effect of “Hey everyone I went to the bar and didn’t drink!”.  Maybe I’m different, but I know that if started hanging around in bars again I would be right back to it before too much longer even if I had great intentions.  And let’s not forget about my bar friends too.  There are a lot of good people who I have completely lost contact with in the past year but I can’t risk my sobriety to let them back into my life.   I do miss some things, things have not been a picnic.  I went through some pretty tough times and struggled with some depression and alcohol / food cravings along the way.  I had several near-misses that I almost broke down and said “what the hell

It all gets me wondering about the larger implications of sobriety on people, it has really driven home the message that not all that meets the eye is what it seems. Friends who I used to think just liked having a good time I now realize are severe alcoholics. But even larger than that, I now walk past bar-filled streets where people are getting plastered and behaving horribly and I think ""How can they do that to themselves?"" often forgetting that I used to be that hollering blackout drunk person. But now it looks like a movie set -- the set they use when trying to show a seedy side of town that the main antagonist haunts. It looks downright *dark*.

Sometimes sobriety makes me think that I've been given a metaphoric red pill and have woken up to a larger battle going on in the world. It makes it seem like our personal fights are actually grander in scale -- they're downright *cosmic*.

I know my life is without a doubt better due to not drinking.  But it's been hard.  I essentially gave up drinking to better my relationship with my boyfriend.  We broke up three weeks ago (for reasons that I blame entirely on my alcoholic mind and choices I made when our relationship started) and there was a hard minute where I thought being a drinker again was the only solution.  

But there was definitely an upside to the breakup because I was able to find the internal strength to keep going

I made him pick me up to touch the ceiling. I wanted to be tall.  Like him.  Turns out,  I became embarrassed of him. He was unemployed a bit. Sometime came to soccer games drunk. But he showed up.

His father died at 53. Was his idol. Defining moment of his life. Still cries when speaking of him. That was 1965. He no longer planned. Lived for now. Not the best idea with a wife and 3 kids. I became angry at him. Wouldn’t stop drinking even though we all hated it. Like his father

Shortly thereafter

My drinking problem surfaced.  Then fully submerged. I feared death.  Feared life. I found AA and noticed I looked like him. He made more sense. I am just like him. I love him. I forgive him. Truly forgive him. AA helped me do that. Now I see how much love he has to give.  He is so beautifully unique.  I admire that.  He’s taught me so much

I move away. Far

I come home to visit. Dad looks grey. Rest of family notices too. Mom finds blood stained underwear. Confronts Dad. He hates doctors. Killed his parents and want him dead too. Was pissing blood for months. Then not at all. Kidney’s failing. Succumbs to fear

I thought I would be able to control it and quickly failed.  The time before that was when I did some jail time for a DWI in 2007.  When I got out after 2 weeks exactly I went straight to the bar upon my release.  

Other than those two times I have been drunk ~at least~ every 3 days for the last ten or so years.  Now I look at how easy it was for me to abstain for this last week compared to the first and have nothing but desire to continue staying sober.  I finally feel like I can control the urge because I can easily keep reminding myself of the consequences and how dreadful they were

When I first posted I mentioned feeling like I have to decide between sobriety and my social life.  After a few days I began to notice that I really don’t.  I just have realize that my social time can be spent sober.  I made a rule not to engage in any social events that surround alcohol.  This helped a lot because it leaves room to do so many things with my friends.  Just last night actually I found out that my best friend is now sober as well because him and his girlfriend are having a baby.  Amazing.

Moving into the future I’m looking forward to being sober for one month.  This is when I will announce my sobriety to the community by posting a picture of a one month coin.  We will see how they react.  I have a reputation for being a drunk and all so it’s sure to shock some people.  I have been making the steps toward being a key volunteer this year at both of our regional burn events.  I plan to commit at least 24 hours of time during the period of our 5 day event in may.  If that is not a promise of sobriety I don’t know what is.  I have a few months to practice not drinking.   Short term projects aside from school have been popping up like cleaning and trying to get my container garden back together.  My wife and I just adopted a conure too so now I get to spend some time training him which is usually very rewarding. 

I like life.  The urge to get twisted is still there

-  My friends, I don't have a lot of ""friends"" to begin with, but all the worry about losing those few folks has gone away now that everyone is aware of my choice to stay sober.

- Holy shit am I way more productive!  All that time when I was first getting sober where I was super bored, and I feel the need less to get through the time, and more to fill it.  To fill it with things I enjoy doing, rather than simply watching the clock go by.  It has made me more productive at work, and at home.  My house is cleaner, my shit is more organized, and I have more products of my hobbies to show.

- Warning, I feel like a malodorous cloud was surrounding me.  I could smell *myself.* (See, I told you it was gross.)  Now that the alcohol is out of my system, the stench is gone.  The foul smell that often accompanied a day of sweating isn't there.

- I have saved a ridiculous amount of money.  A few weeks into my sobriety I did a check on how much money I was actually spending on alcohol, I'm also not spending god-knows-how-much on Amazon while drunk.

- Overall, I have found that the effort is well worth it.

- Even though technically this is just a group of internet strangers, is amazing.  In addition, the people here have been tremendous, and I have experienced only kindness, support, and camaraderie.  Watching the membership tick over 4,000 feels great.  That means that another one thousand people have decided to make the step to stop drinking, supportive and effective community.

I'm working on 90 days minus hooch.  I've been tested over the weeks
Been able to fend off the demons so far

A bit of a side story-- I live in a trailer park currently.  It's in small-town USA

Wouldn't you know it, and a hair salon and couple of sub-par pizza places that complete the set of the local ""businesses.""
Can't say I blame the store owners

I read somewhere the other day about the smattering of controlled substances we have here in Western Earth, Alcohol...it's dumb luck that some are legal and some are not.  Boggles the mind sometimes, can't help but think of the discussion about the lengths we go to ""protect ourselves and society from the dangers of _____.""

So back to the original story, gaunt woman walks by me, clearly having trouble with her balance...she was about 50 with her blonde hair up, and had that stare that inebriated people sometimes get when they are fixated.  I knew immediately where she was headed, and watched her stop and settle her balance a couple of times before she reached the door of the liquor store.  

When I was still drinking I had gotten to know the nice young middle eastern couple that owns the store, I watched her come out of the store with a rather large bag, looked about the size of two 12-packs of beer.  I cringed, as selling to a clearly inebriated person can result in heavy fines and a loss of their liquor selling license.  Apparently, that sort of problem was ignored.  Any normal person would have noticed this woman...was schnockered.  Wasted.  Tanked.  

I continued walking and watching, before I wised up. 

Sure enough, sloppy roll in only the way a severe drunk person can.  Just at that moment, an older couple was driving by and stopped to assist her up and they helped her back to the door of her trailer.   It was just sad.

Last night I decided to have a wii smash bros. tournament for my kids and their friends.  I set chairs up in the garage.  Sold my xbox and bought a used wii.  Hooked it up to a tv in the garage.  By 7 oclock all my kids friends were hanging out

This is the sort of thing I can do now.  

I wasn't angry because it was drinking time.  I wasn't pissed at the world because life sucked.  I wasn't having a pity party because something wasn't going my way.  Just clean wholesome fun.  And having a drink never crossed my mind.

This is how life can and should be.  Happy

This subreddit helped me.  It slapped me in the face and said ""dude you have a problem.""  But that was not enough to get me to stop.  139 days ago I went to a meeting.  I haven't had a drink since.  I go to many meetings and use this sub.  That's it.  And it is working for me.

I actually really honest to God did it. And ya know what? It was even as painful as I thought it was gonna be! 

For those of you that dont know

I know theres some conflicting opinons about AA, and they were having the exact same problem I was having. I didn't have to feel like a loser or a freak because I cant, for the life of me, drink in moderation. 

I also made a group of friends my age in AA pretty quickly, I haven't even had time to think about a drink. I've met people in meetings all over the Boston area, as well as a group I see almost every night in my hometown meetings. 

Pretty much the point I wanna make, its still an hour you are sober, and its an opportunity to make some new friends who are also sober and go do some fun sober stuff with.  

All of this being said, patient group of people who have all managed to show up to the same place and I love all of you. I can't express how grateful I am that the people in here were able to explain to me (ever so gently) that yes, my drinking was out of control, and yes I needed to stop.

And I decided that goddamit, I wouldn't need to have this argument with myself over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. 

It was just bizarre. Like I could divine exactly what would happen. It's the same thing that happens every time I drink. I attempt to moderate, and then the fourth catches me and it's off to the races and I'm drinking like it's my other job. 

The problem is that one is too many and a dozen isn't enough. *(DISCLAIMER: Not mine but it really hits the nail on the head

I didn't drink. And I'm not going to. They can have all the drinks they want. They can even pour some out for me. 

But it's kind of like spaceflight. We, most accidents happen just after liftoff, and so we crash. We try to moderate or just go All Out, because it's The Last Time. We fall back to earth and try and try again, tweaking things here and there, making adjustments, experimenting, until we're ready for another serious liftoff again.

(Sorry about that.)",FantasyDoll,54,68, I just want to say that I am sorry because this is going to be disgustingly long, but right now I could really use some help

I have avoided posting anything about this aspect of my life mainly because I have seen how most people on Reddit seem to treat people who are going through what I am currently experiencing. I already hate myself enough as it is, I really need a safe place with people who understand and who will not judge me, think less of me, or hate me because of my past, and I am hoping this will turn out to be what is quite possibly the only safe place to actually open up… 

I hate myself right now. Currently on probation for a second DUI that I received in 2010. After my first DUI, I was required to regularly attend AA meetings as a term of my probation, so I started going to those several times a week. I genuinely took an interest in the program and the wonderful people I met along the way, but once I was off probation I started drinking again and stopped going. I saw no problem with this at the time and continued to go out every weekend, get drunk beyond all hope, and loved every minute of it. 

It is several years later now and I have been on probation for the second DUI for just short of a year. I did not drink during any of that time, I probably should have been back on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications during this time, but I was in denial and wanted with all my heart to believe that I did not have a problem with alcohol, despite some very real and very obvious signs. I had become a master at denial at this point. 

Then came one random night in October. I still have no idea what happened inside my brain. I knew I was not supposed to be drinking, but I know that the committee in my head had a drinking justification meeting and I decided to find their reasoning acceptable. The beginning of the night was great and I had a lot of fun. However, once my ""friend"" dropped me off at my house my entire world crashed down upon me. Before I went inside, I decided to smoke a cigarette but I wanted to listen to the radio in my vehicle because it was a little bit less cold in there than it was outside (how is that for a ridiculous justification? :/.) So I did. 

There was no actual driving involved, the fact that I had been drinking and my keys were in the ignition outweighed the fact that I had not been driving, nor did I intend to, and the fact that my house was about ten feet away. I was arrested that night and charged with another DUI.

And this basically brings me to today, you know how powerful addiction plus denial can be. And even though I was not driving that night in October, when it comes down to it I know that I deserve that DUI too. Regardless of what I did not do, the fact of the matter is that, at the very least, I was still drinking when I am on probation and I should fucking know better than that by now. I am very lucky, and very grateful

It absolutely KILLS me that I am in this situation again. I keep thinking of all kinds of should haves, but sometimes I find myself wishing that I would. I am so tired of disappointing my family. I am so tired of being the bad child in the family, the one who continually does the stupidest shit imaginable to fuck up her life. It is bad enough what all of this is doing to me now and how it will affect my life in the future, but it feels far worse knowing how much I have let my family down. Again. 

I have not been sentenced for what happened in October yet, yes, but not a bad one. But I am not strong enough for this. I sat in jail for a week after I got arrested and believe me, that was more than enough time in that shithole to know that that is a place I never want to see the inside of again. I may feel like I am destroyed now, but jail time is going to fucking obliterate me. I have so many emotions and have always struggled with the fact that I feel them all so deeply. Sometimes I fear that I feel everything far *too* deeply, if that is a thing that is possible.  Being thrown in jail to be forgotten about is not going to help me. Sitting around all day, every fucking day, especially not now when I have finally stopped living in Denialville and have officially moved to Acceptancetown. 

*Sidenote: Why is it that people who donate books to jails think that all chicks in jail want to read are romance novels? Seriously. Aside from the fact that I hate them, they have enough of those already!*

Sitting in jail for that week did give me plenty of time to reflect though. I realized in there that I could not ignore it anymore. I have a problem with alcohol. A huge fucking problem

I am an alcoholic and I fucking need help.

I would remiss to not include something good in this post though, it is seriously wonderful having a probation officer who does not just want to lock you up and throw away the key when you fuck up and need help. She genuinely cares about me and all she wants to do is help me, and I am incredibly grateful to have her in my life right now. I still attend my alcohol class that I have been in since August, and the counselor there also let me into her relapse prevention class, which I am currently attending simply because I want to be there. I am also going to start attending AA again in the morning. Being able to go there and finally being able to be honest with myself and with everybody else is something I am quite looking forward to. I also enrolled in college and start classes on Tuesday, which I am ecstatic about. 

One wonderful thing that came out of all of this is sobriety, I understand why they do not trust me. I do not deserve their trust right now, but I hope to God they let me earn it.

I am doing everything I can to start putting the pieces of my heart, but I fucking pray that the judge will see how serious I am taking this now and how hard I am working to ensure that I never have to drink again. Going to jail is just going to cause me to lose everything. Looking back, maybe jail would have been the wake-up call I needed when I was in trouble before, but that one single week in jail this time was all the wake-up I needed. 

I just… I do not know. This is the longest fucking post ever and I doubt anybody gives a bag of butts about anything I have to say.

I guess I am just tired. Tired of being a failure - in my eyes

I am also very sorry to anybody who actually read through this whole post. I know it is way too fucking long but like I said before, and I need to get the hell out.

I am trying to not have a complete emotional meltdown, =(. I am just a very tormented girl right now, and I do not know where else to turn. Thank you very much for listening and letting me get this off my chest though, it means a lot to me. I hope you are all having a great night, =).





**TL;DR** I am a fucking idiot. Do not be like me.

**EDIT:** I just wanted to thank everyone here for all of the kind words and advice and support. This is a seriously wonderful place with wonderful people and I am very glad I found it. Thank you for letting me get all of this off my chest, and thank you for welcoming me into the community. It really means a lot to me, &lt;3.

 I've been drinking since I was 15. Loved the way it made me feel and ""forget"" about life's problems. I just turned 29 in June, and other stresses in life I was using more and more and also abusing Adderall. I quit Adderall over a year ago and that was much easier to quit (for me anyways) than alcohol. But alcohol is everywhere so that was much harder. 

So over the past year my boyfriend was pretty much ready to throw in the towel with the way I was drinking and every attempt to ""quit"" or ""limit myself"" ended up in failure. Then in March I drank several more times and with the threat of losing my SO, not just any hole-in-the way open discussion meeting. Nothing against those types of meetings, as I go to those now as well, but for me it was important to see the solution, and people actively working the 12 steps. I also met my sponsor there. I started going to other meetings and working on Step 1. I made it 3 weeks then gave in one day and had some vodka. The next day I was crying like a little baby. I felt so wrong. I think my resistance to God and that he ""gets all the credit"" is something I resented so I just drank. But I learned from that mistake and haven't had a drink since then (101 days ago)! I realized after that, everyone has their own conception of God and as long as I make effort to pray and have him in my life I'll be ok. I'm so relieved that I'm not ""running the entire show"" now! 

Now I'm on Step 4. AA is life changing. I actually enjoy getting up and looking forward to things. I don't even crave alcohol anymore. My depression that I've battled since a teen has pretty much vanished. I'm learning more about myself and how to ""live on life's terms"". My relationships are richer

After I dropped her off, and I figured, ""Fuck it. It's just one drink."" and I downed it.  

I know. I should know better

Well, seemingly in a daze, I was getting out of my car and walking into the liquor store. One fucking drink...ONE...and I was determined to get more. I got within 10 feet of the door and now it was my SOBER voice in the back of my mind, and it was saying ""What the fuck makes you think that THIS is a good idea?""    

I stopped in my tracks and looked in the window at all the people shopping away, I couldn't fight it off, and after over a month of sobriety, I almost let it sink its claws into me again. So I got back in the car and drove home.  

I was strong, I was making tremendous progress, and every aspect of my life was coming together beyond my wildest expectations. And one lousy drink had me ready to toss it all away.

I did the first 2 weeks by gorging on sugar and grilled cheeses and playing guitar till my hands cramped up.  After that it's been easier.

Tonight I was driving and hit a sobriety checkpoint.  Very surreal not to have a feeling of dread wash over me.

Went through some pretty bad withdrawal symptoms in the first 2 weeks with mood swings and insomnia

I am more depressed than I was while drinking.  More than anything

I haven't lost any weight as I hoped I would, but I quit so that I wouldn't hurt myself or someone else, not so that my day-to-day would be any easier.  I am a violent alcoholic.

All of the things I did while drinking I can still do

I can perform better sexually.

I'm saving ALOT of money.

Overall, I just wait and it subsides eventually.  I sometimes will have dreams/nightmares where I get hammered, and will wake up feeling guilty for failing.

I'm lucky in that I'm actually kind of frightened of alcohol at this point.  It turned bad on me real fast, the more frightening and foreign my drinking days will all seem to me.

1345748520.0,ypks3,How to get yourself to 200 days.  Maybe more even.,offtherocks,54,4,18,"200 days. Two Hundred. Two-Zero-Zero. 0xC8. 0o310. 0b11001000.

And I've gotta be honest, but because it becomes less of a daily struggle. I think that's why so many people relapse around the 30-day mark. It gets easy to forget the pain you went through to stack up those days.  

**Don't forget**

But I don't want to forget. Forgetting leads to indifference, I had no idea how I'd get to 20 days, let alone 200. It was a struggle just to make it to the next hour. I whiled away the time playing Minecraft &amp; reading old threads on SD.

**Get Educated**

It's probably not true, you start to notice a few common themes. The big one: getting sober is about more than simply not drinking. There's a lot of hard work required. Intrapersonal type stuff. Painful stuff. But it's necessary. If you're struggling, you're doing something wrong. Figure out what it is and fix the problem.
 

**Be open**

I had a few chips on my shoulder coming in. I'm sure I still do. But back then I thought I had it all figured out. ""But wait!"", all at the same time.  Sound crazy? Sound familiar?


**Get Involved**

If you've got 1 day sober, man"" to let someone know you understand goes a long way. I feel a certain connection with the people who started out around the same time I did. We went through the same things at the same time. We supported each other. When someone disappeared for a week, we'd send PM's asking, ""Everything OK?""  A lot of these people are having their own 200 day anniversaries right about now.  I can't help but think that the sense of community here on /r/stopdrinking has something to do with that.

1374918461.0,1j5jrz,My story and battle with alcoholism. I spent over 3 hours writing this and I hope you guys enjoy reading it!,mitchyy,60,11,14,"My name is Mitch N and I am an alcoholic. I am 22 years old. The day I decided enough is enough was July 13th 2013. I was born into a wonderful and very loving family with both my parents who are still together to this day who love, and will get tough. We've been together through the worst of my alcoholism

My first experience with alcohol began when I was 15 years old. I still remember the rush of opening the refrigerator and looking at one of my fathers can of Busch Light and his voice running through my mind ""If you ever drink or touch my beer, I hesitated for a moment, holding the ice cold beer in my hand, feeling the sweat of the can drizzle down the side of the can onto my fingers. I put it up to my nose and sniffed the beer ""WOHA THAT SMELLS NASTY!"" I remember saying to myself. I dabbed my finger into the brownish liquid inside the can mouth and tasted it off my finger ""not much taste"" I thought ""maybe this isn't as bad as it smells!"", I took a swig and swallowed the liquid quickly.

The taste it left in my mouth wasn't good but it wasn't bad tasting in a way. I took another swig, the can was finished. I thought to myself ""This just tastes like a really bad version of water"" and never thought twice about drinking another one. Fast forward to one year later.

Freshly licensed driver with pure rebellion intention coursing through my teenage body with a no good group of friends. I was invited to a going away party for a friend of a friend who was going into the military and overseas to Iraq. I was told this was going to be a ""kick ass party"" and everyone could drink as much as they wanted for 5 dollars! I decided that day was the day I was going to really experience what alcohol was really about. This was the worst decision I had ever made in my life and wish I could go back and change it

We showed up to this party. I was absolutely amazed at the amount of people there, ""Pussy!"". I sat down at a table by myself because none of my friends wanted to sit with me out of fear of being seen with someone like me and felt pretty bad about myself. I looked around and heard the familiar sounds of technical difficulties from the DJ booth and seeing a line near the keg of beer. I got up with my cup in hand and stood out of line but near the keg and studied the way people were using it and dispensing beer into their cups to avoid another embarrassing moment for myself. I mustered up the courage and got in the line.

The line moved quickly and I got closer and closer ""now's my time to shine

I sipped my beer slowly while looking around. I began to notice more and more people were getting louder and louder and much more active and stumbling all over the place. Some were even puking into trash cans. ""How are these people getting like this?"" when suddenly a girl appeared next to me ""How many beers have you had so far?"" she slurred, it was my dads."" I said. She laughed at me and told me ""Chug it if you want to get drunk fast, drink slow if you want to be a pussy"". Insulted and having not really proved myself at all that night without any words said I chugged it. I felt a slightly uncomfortable sensation in my stomach, almost aching. Suddenly I burped and quickly got back in line for a refill.

The night progressed on, my body felt number with each drink, my confidence level rose. The angriest of people seemed the nicest, the ugliest seemed the most beautiful and mischievous activities seemed like the best things to do. After hours of talking with completely random strangers who did not even remember me from my embarrassing entrance, the night was winding down and I hitched a ride back to a friends house. I laid down on his cold tile floor in the basement and thought to myself ""This is the most comfortable place I have ever slept! I want to feel like this forever."" Words that proved fatal for years to come for me.

Fast forward to a couple months later. I am sitting at home by myself with nothing to do. I dumped the group of friends that I attended the party with due to getting into way too much trouble with them weeks after. I remembered that party and everything I felt from it. I wanted it again, there's been bottles of wine sitting in the back of an old shelf in my basement that have so much dust on them, they'll never suspect they're gone! 

I quickly ran downstairs and grabbed one of the bottles and ran it under some water to remove the dust. I read the label, the numbness, the giggles, the slurred speech. It didn't stop there, the effects became more and more intense. I finally reached full blown drunk. I reached what every person wanted to achieve at that party.

I tried to stand from my chair and take a step but my legs buckled and I fell face first to the ground. I laughed and dragged myself across the floor over and over. The blurriness in my vision was getting more and more intense. I could not make out objects near or far

Fast forward to 18 to present. I'm now what they call ""an experienced drinker"" I've tasted every beer I could get my hands on, my worst time came at 20 to 22. It became out of control and on my 21st birthday I still had no friends and spent my 21st birthday sitting in my car in the middle of the night alone with my radio on drinking a fifth of Captain Morgan to myself. I told myself over and over ""This needs to stop, it's getting out of hand"". I was mixing 12.5 MG Ambien CR's with 10 - 12 beers nightly as a regimen for sleep. I would pass out for upwards to 15 - 18 hours at a time and awake confused, very hung over and millions of brain cells less. My health was deteriorating, I began skipping meals to make sure I had an empty stomach so my sleeping pill would work at night and the alcohol would effect me if I had eaten forget about it, it wouldn't do a thing to me. 

Finally I hit rock bottom on July 13th 2013. My girlfriend (who rarely drinks) and I were going to spend a Saturday afternoon with a couple of drinks and washing her car. We went to the nearest liquor store and picked up a case of beer for me and UV Blue and Lemonade for her. Forgetting she had Bud Lite Strawberitas in the fridge I got for her a couple weeks back I got the drinks and went home and started right away on the drinks at 1 PM. She mixed her drinks with little bit of UV blue and lots of lemonade

The night progressed on, already completely wasted but still wanting more I swished down the Ambien with the wine and just knocked the bottle back and started chugging. My brother came upstairs and saw me doing this and took away the bottle away as I was obviously already completely hammered, holding myself up on the counter while chugging the wine trying not to fall. He dumped it down the drain and I quickly ran into the room and grabbed 2 beers when he went downstairs and chugged those. The last thing I remembered was walking half way up the stairs and blank.

I woke up the next morning, got up and walked up the stairs into your room and fell in your room then started smashing your head against the floor over and over in anger, your girlfriend attempted to stop you, you got angry and cornered her and tried to punch her. She ran down to me and you chased her I slapped you across the face because you were trying to get past me to hit her while yelling and screaming. Your father came downstairs and clocked you right in the face and knocked you out and put you in bed and she went home. You're disgusting, get your fucking life together you stupid drunk""

1372029861.0,1gxo1r,Some lessons learned from yesterday,TRextacy9,49,3,10,"I went to a city music festival yesterday with a friend and feel that it reinforced my sobriety.

He was pressuring me to drink at the start of it and periodically throughout the day long festival. I never had an urge to drink and it was enlightening to watch him and a few other people

I saw this play out as my friend got increasingly inebriated. Him and another girl we were hanging out with were fun to talk to in the beginning and became more self-focused and less engaged in normal conversation as they drank. I was actually annoyed to be around them after awhile. 

Also, he was so drunk he probably didn't remember the show. He also spent a greater portion of the day worrying about getting his next drink and standing in line at various bars than watching the shows. 

Later in the night

When I got home from the festival I was pretty angry because of the way my friend acted and the fact that so much socializing seems to revolve around alcohol. Then I woke up today and went mountain biking with a friend while the majority of the people who attended the festival were still in bed hungover.

Not having a license also makes it very difficult to get to an AA meeting. My physiatrist at the VA, about 5 months ago, prescribed me a medication to help me detox outpatient, but I only lasted 5 days after that. However I can't get to the VA cause I have no license...

http://www.wtfpod.com/  Monday's episode

""here's the deal, August 9th, last Friday.  14 years sober and clean. 14 years of not wondering, 'hey, where the fuck am? who's that? what happened in here? who the -- what the hell? what is this stuff all over the floor. none of that. no waking up and piecing together the events of the evening, maybe flashing back to that making people upset, no hangovers, no more staying up for three days on end, there's a big list of shit.

and i don't wanna preach, know who you are, you can fight it all you want, i'm only speaking from experience, the first few years were fucking horrendous, i was out of my mind.

people ask me how i did it. and i will say openly, and i made it my own, and integrated the thoughts of the program into my own brain, i don't speak for the program at all but at the beginning i went to two or three meetings every fucking day for a year.... until uh, because it was all i had to do, all i  wanted to do.   i had to get sober. and i stayed sober somehow.

look. i know that this podcast helps people with this stuff

unmanageability. that's the core of the issue. there's a lot of functional alcoholics out there. god bless ya. a lot of people who love the booze

if you wonder whether or not you have a drug or alcohol problem is if you're fucked up and you wanna be not fucked up and you can't stop getting fucked up. that's it.

do what you gotta do. there's other ways to get sober. you can white knuckle it, it's fucking hard. for about a year to five years. and then you finally get your shit together enough and you get the hang of being sober...

and then you just sort of live with the aggravation of it. and i know some of you are thinking 'but dude

i am a compulsive-addictive personality i also have a fucking tremendous eating disorder and complete body dysmorphia and i eat compulsively. what else do i do? i probably masturbate more than i need to. yeah

do i self medicate? fuck yes i do. am i fucked up on booze and drugs? no.  are the things i'm not relatively safer than booze and drugs and not that mind altering? yes.  you draw your own lines

i know a lot of people and they go to the things and they're like 'i dunno there's a lot of god' and well alight scratch god. lose god. take what you need. figure it out. it's possible.

am i happier? yes. am i more productive? yes. am i more happy? yes. did it take a long fucking time?

here's the deal. when you're an alcoholic or a drug addict

i'm gonna fucking drink onto that. yeah hell yeah now i can accept me. i'm cool

it's no minor feat. 14 years sober. or one day sober. and if you've got a problem, not really a miracle guy, but it's a lot of work and a lot of self-acceptance, and i'll be honest with you, after a few years... the obsession goes away. you don't get that hunger.

i'm 29. i drank for sixteen years. a year or so ago i had my first blackout, but it just goes to show that alcoholism is indeed very progressive. it never gets better, only worse.  that spawned a lot of blackouts and confusion. i did things during blackouts that left me feeling traumatized, very sorry for myself, and like i was a terrible person. it took me a while to gather the motivation to stop moping and get sober. i started going to aa and na at the start of this year. i've had relapses, but they get further and further apart and today i feel like drugs and alcohol are not a part of my life. i'm still trying to figure out what is. i live in a small town and don't have my provisional license yet so i can only manage one meeting a week and one or two more when my friend decides she wants to go to one/take me to one, but i personally find they really help, and they give me so much hope that life can be great without having to get fucked up.

The simple answer would be that I didn't

A less simple answer would be that I was lucky enough to realize I wasn't as smart as I thought I was and so I did what AA in its collective wisdom told me to do.

So what was the trigger? To this day I don't honestly know. I had been hospitalized twice with DTs and was given up for dead or at least near-dead once. But, about a fifth of cheap vodka a day.

Then, but a dirty, grungy stop-of-last-resort for the area's drunks.

My wife was appalled at the treatment I got, sure, with 4"" of snow on the ground on the side of a mountain. Most of my detox stay remains a blur. I do know I was sick and miserable and slept a lot.

Then

Not being a particularly religious sort I wasn't really into the spiritual aspects of the program, let's call it my Higher Power, whatever it might be.

They told me I'd probably lose my drinking buddies. They were right

Years go by. By the time I had 12 years sober I reasoned that I'd maybe gotten a little walking-around sense that could be of use to AA, but I came close.

Meetings every week became the norm. They kept telling me that maybe I didn't need a meeting every week

By 30 years it became apparent that I'd finally found a new way of life and alcohol wasn't a part of it. I was firmly convinced that I was like a black man -- I could change the status, it's alcoholic.

Where to now at 37 years? I realize I have more years behind me than ahead of me -- life is like that. I'm still wedded to the alcoholic community -- bought tires today from a guy who'se an alcoholic. Why? Because unlike most tire salesmen

Why am I posting this wall of text?

For years I had been a heavy daily drinker, and didn't do any irreparable damage (that I know of). But emotionally I was close to absolute zero, just going through the motions every day. Things steadily progressed to the point where a year ago I was dangerously close to losing my life, along with every amazing gift I had ever been given. Poof. That moment resulted in a feeling I had never felt before, and hope to never feel again - total despair and defeat. I decided that absolutely anything was better than that feeling, and walked into AA the next day. Things have gotten steadily better since then. Not perfect, but workable. And that's a pretty damn good feeling. I've learned that I have a lot more to learn about sobriety and growth. But I've also learned that sobriety is absolutely possible. If I can do it

Primarily I've gotten to a year by not taking a drink one day at a time. A number of things have made that daily goal easier - to each his or her own


* I don't drink no matter what - 'Nuff said. Hard
* One day at a time - More than anything else
* Journaling - There's a lot of crap in my head. It really helps to get it out on paper. Plus
* Meditation - Helps to calm my mind and gain perspective. Practicing mindfulness and gratitude has gone a long
* Exercise - Getting up early to work out not only gives me a reason to not drink at night
* Being responsible - I used alcohol to avoid life. Avoiding life via other escapes puts me back in that bad place again.
* Posting here - This is such a great resource, just do it! Talking to sober people starts to rub off after a while.
* And finally, to say the least. 

So that's it. I dig being sober, but it could be the best thing you ever do. I'm an alcoholic, but I'm in recovery with you all. And that feels pretty good no matter what day we're on.

Thanks SD!

Also

* Returning movies to Redbox the next day because I actually remember everything that happened with only one viewing.

* The fish in my fishtank stay alive longer than
* My call of duty skills no longer experience a dramatic drop off after 5pm.
* The poop thing - much better. You know what I'm talking about.
* Waking up in freshly washed sheets instead of McDouble wrappers.
* Spending $0 on Altoids because I don't need to disguise my breath poorly.
* Relaxed mornings instead of a daily oh-fuck-I'm-late.
* I can reference specific songs a band played instead of ""Yeah
* Donating all my old 'fat guy' clothes.
* I don't get enraged by birds waking me up before the break of noon.

1339183118.0,us0m5,A letter to my old drunken self,midlake500,51,5,8,"Hello Alcoholic Bob

I now understand why people choose not to drink: they feel better sober than you do at your most drunk. I can hear your mocking laughter now: ""I fell fantastic when I drink, and not a single bit of alcohol, or any drug, is in my system. If you don't believe me we could draw our dopamine or serotonin levels when I'm sober and when you're drunk, and you'll wish you were drinking what I'm drinking.

One upon a time, songs, movies, television, your own friends. We were all raised on to believe that alcohol was a good time, the best time you could have. After you turned 21, you waited anxiously for the weekend to come so you can have the most fun possible. Whether it was going out with friends, camping

Pretty soon, working on your motorcycle and drinking. All because it was the most fun. After a while you started to concern yourself and others with just how often and how much you were ""having fun"". It bothered you when people didn't drink with you. You were mad that others seemed content without drinking. You were jealous, so you told them that their happiness was fake. Your health started to decline, your mental clarity started to go, and your work performance was starting to decline. But you were having fun all the time.

You tried convincing yourself you could control it, you were just trying to feel the same way sober people feel all the time. You would search deeper and deeper into the bottle for the same happiness and fun you once had, but you could never find it. You knew you had to quit, but you were afraid, because you didn't want to play video games, go out with friends, go camping

But I'm going to tell you something that you won't believe, it can't make you happy or give you a buzz, and it never did. You were deceived. I can hear you now, scowling, mocking me: ""of course it gives me a buzz and makes me happy, I feel fantastic when I drink"". You didn't, it's impossible, research it. Alcohol inhibits brain function

Every warning light on your vehicle was going off and flashing, everything appears to be working perfectly, I can finally enjoy the ride"". Alcohol doesn't work, you were only fooling yourself. All the Budweiser commercials showing people having a good time drinking, the songs on the radio, people having the time of their lives in the movies, your friends talking about what great times they had drinking, it doesn't take away your problems

I could have a drink today, and I don't know how I could have ever been so deceived. You were never high off alcohol, you were high off whatever you were doing when you were drunk and gave credit to the wrong thing. Each time you had friends over to play video games and got drunk, and had an amazing time, you thought: ""what an amazing night, alcohol makes me feel amazing!"". The experience was great, but alcohol got all the credit

Don't believe me? Sit with bottle in the middle of the room, no video games, and just drink. Are you becoming more happy, are you having fun? No! You're becoming less and less conscious, only inhibiting normal brain function. You don't feel any happier, nor are you having any more fun. It was one giant placebo, alcohol doesn't work. That's why you look deeper and deeper into the bottle looking for happiness, you gave credit to the wrong thing

Today, I'm sober because being drunk is a shitty experience, it's not fun. Alcohol never gave me a buzz to begin with, it just made me less conscious. I had deceived myself.

Today, I'm going to wake up early tomorrow to go fishing for the first time in years. I can't wait to go to dinner with my fiancee, I'm going to get ""smashed"". I can't wait to wake up early tomorrow and work on my motorcycle, and then do some landscaping, and then walk my dogs at the park, and then play some Diablo. I will be absolutely ""wasted"", and more drunk than you have ever been in your life.

You will need to make some changes though, I would recommend looking into the field of positive psychology. The book ""The Happiness Advantage"" by Sean Achor will change your life. It's a scientifically based meta analysis on happiness that look into what makes our brains happy, not that foofy pep talk stuff you're use to seeing on TV. I know you don't like to read, so luckily they have it on audio book available freely on a site called The Pirate Bay. Also, Tal Ben-Shahar has some great books as well.

Get back to the gym

Also, lower your heartbeat, and improve your memory. Try a guided meditation first, because I know you have no clue what you're doing. They can be found all over YouTube.

Also

Get a journal, write things down.

r/frisson gives you a better high than alcohol ever did. Just compare the two. Sit in a room alone with a bottle and drink. Now watch something like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtAdneAfzcc&amp;feature=related) or [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g9poWKKpbU) and compare how you feel.

You won't want to drink when you do any of these things because it will only lessen the experience. You'll want to be 100% conscious for every last boss kill

Don't focus on trying to quit alcohol, and the alcoholism will shed itself.  You might as well be trying to quit drinking motor oil, there's nothing to quit. It might take you a bit to comes to terms with the fact that alcohol doesn't do the things you though it did, that it doesn't work. It'll seen a little frightening, and yet liberating at the same time. You'll be drunker than you've ever been drunk in your life.

*I don’t know how to start this other than say that I am an alcoholic. For the past ten years or so, stress, personal torment, and frustration. The fact that my alcohol use hasn’t caused the death or injury of someone, or my own death is quite frankly, an incredible stroke of luck or divine intervention. Trying to write down all the times that I’ve narrowly escaped a DUI arrest, a car crash

My drinking is abusive. I do not drink because I like the taste of alcohol or that I’m a wine snob or beer geek. I CANNOT have one. The times I have been able to have a single drink have been torture, made me laugh harder, made me funnier, or more creative, there have been ten nights where I've put my or someone else's life in danger, said or done something incredibly stupid, or just basically been a sloppy, ugly person. 

This relationship with alcohol is textbook abusive. It kicks the shit out of me on a daily basis and is hurting me all the time. Six days a week it makes my life miserable and makes me hate myself and feel like a piece of garbage, so I go back to thinking everything is okay.

My memory of the nights before is fucking SHOT. I feel like every time I drink, I'm usually faking it. Even the nights where I don't have 'a lot' to drink (less than 6, if I'm being generous), it still affects my memory. This is getting worse, there's no doubt about it. Nights I drink a lot, it ends up being a total blackout. More moderate nights still have gaps in them, and this shouldn't be happening. I'm damaging my brain.

The thing that I cannot stop thinking about is that something terrible is going to happen. The best case scenario would be a DUI arrest. I would get pulled over some night coming home from the bars , but I'd probably blow twice the legal limit, because my tolerance is so high. I'd be arrested, and have to pay over $2000 in fines and fees, and I'd have to face my beautiful wife and see her disappointment. I'd have to look my father in law in the eye, and see how I let him down, and see his opinion of me change before my very eyes, he's wondering why he's supporting this man who married his daughter. I sit here and talk shit about my friend with DUIs

The worst case scenario in the immediate future is my death. I'd flip my car or drive off the road into a tree, where I'd be crushed and ripped apart. I'm crying right now as I think of the scene when my mother and my wife are called and told that I fucking killed myself due to my own stupidity and selfishness. My mother and father would live the rest of their shortened lives in terrible emotional pain, and I would have negated all the joy and happiness that they had ever had before. My beautiful wife would be so crushed and devastated. She would live the rest of her life wondering what we could have had together. Eventually she would move on and realize that it's pointless to mourn me, and find a new life, and I'd be forgotten. The true love that we've built so far, as amazing and wonderful as it is, would mean nothing.

But if the same luck I've had continues for a while, I have a ridiculous tolerance for alcohol, and it's been burned into my brain that I like drinking and I like the feeling of being drunk. This could just continue for another thirty years, and in that time I'll have gotten a few DUIs, lost my family, burned out my liver, become fatter than I already am because of alcohol

I do not want to be a lonely old drunk who pissed away my one, and present in the moment. 

I had these exact same thoughts and feelings twice in the last two weeks, at least fucking TRY to stop for a while, and it lasted for three days after the game, and a single fucking day after the christmas party. I am powerless over this, and I need help. 

I need to get ahold of this now, close calls, and self-inflicted torment to pull from my memory that clearly tell me that this isn't working, and I need a change.

If it was somewhat warm out, it'd absorb any sweat before my shirt started to show it.  And it worked well.

In the last 80+ days, and not drinking.  I've lost 35+ pounds and had to buy new clothes.  Additionally, I no longer wear an undershirt.  I just don't get that unreasonably hot anymore.  Sure, I get hot.  I played tennis with my dad over the weekend and sweated my fair share.  But, instead of it taking upwards of an hour to cool down, I cooled down right away.  

Incidentally, I got my weight down to 200 pounds (about 50 pounds less than I weight now).  And, I was still always hot.  But I was also still drinking like a fiend.  I think the weight loss + not drinking has helped me become a hotter version of myself that's just a bit cooler too.

Then yesterday I wake up early in the morning with chest pains, and was given meds for my heart and withdrawal symptoms. After some tests the doctor comes in and warns that I'm showing since of cirrhosis on my liver, and most of my organs were poorer-than-average.

1358255209.0,16m6a9,"""It's not fair!""",gibbertyflibbert,50,6,25,"I was thinking today about how my internal sense of ~~justice~~ entitlement has been a key issue in trying to stay away from that first drink. There's a part of me that screams that it is unfair that I can no longer have the pleasure of liqueur ever again; whether that's a grand wine or the cheap and cheerful booze plied at parties to help you have a good time. It feels unfair that the odds have been against me. Anxiety, that I should be pre-disposed, to alcoholism. It feels unfair that I have to deny myself something other people can have with no ill effects apart from a slight headache in the morning or a depleted wallet. It feels unfair and - there's a genuine sadness in that - that the sweet social inebriation people can dip in and out of at weddings



Then this morning I thought: life's not fair. Related to that: suck it up.




**I've realised that my sense that I should be allowed, depression, and self-hatred - has been a major barrier in these first couple of months of sobriety.** There isn't an overarching ledger of justice that decrees everyone should be allowed to enjoy a glass of wine or a bottle of beer without any repercussions. I can't have something other people can have. Big deal. In return, I get to learn how to be grateful for the things I do have. I have a family, and friends, and education, and enough money for food, and tolerate my bills. I'm able to vote. I'm able to write. I'm able to walk. 




Recognising all of this has helped me start something: I'm able to take responsibility for my alcoholism because that means I can also take responsibility for my sobriety. No-one put a gun to my head and made me drink. Whatever other factors there were, its wiring, the way it releases chemicals, irrevocably. [""No backsies!"" says scumbag neurology]. No more alcohol, but not ""ever again"", because ""ever again"" is too frightening and too big a place to think about. Just no more alcohol today. And the next. And the one after that. And each day I don't, I'm making it an aim to try and be grateful: to erode the self-pity of the alcoholic, for the things I haven't

*Another Wall-o'-Text^™ from Ambivalent_Fanatic*



As we approach our 4



If you are anything like the kind of drinker I was for most of my career, you've never had a DUI, you aren't dying of cirrhosis—so while things aren't great, they're not nearly as bad as they could be.



For most of my drinking life

* turning 21 (because I thought drinking would lose its thrill once it was legal)

* graduating from college (because I would be out in the real world)

* getting my first real professional job (because I didn't think I could keep drinking the way I was and still function)

* turning 25 (because there was a time when this seemed really old to me)

* turning 30 (ditto)

* getting married (because that would magically make me an adult)

* becoming a father (ditto)

* becoming a father for the second time (ditto again)

* turning 35 (see 21



Each time I hit one of these markers, but I relapsed each time. I knew that I was ""struggling"" with alcohol, but I believed that eventually I would win the struggle.  I was wrong.   I thought that my self-awareness meant that I was ""working on it"" and that eventually I would work my way through to the other end.  I was wrong about that too.  



For an alcoholic like me, a month shy of my fortieth birthday, I stopped drinking completely.  No more trying.  No more thinking about it.  No more claiming that I was working on the problem.  I just did it.



Of course, told me she was going to leave me and take the kids if I didn't quit.  It was a very painful conversation.  But that was when I realized that nothing was going to change until I made it change.  



That first moment of true honesty was tremendously difficult to approach.  But like all events we're nervous about ahead of time, like Odysseus sailing home through dangerous seas and fighting off horrible monsters.  I didn't feel as if I was taking on more than I could handle.  What I felt was overwhelming relief.  I didn't have to fight the fight any more if I didn't want to.  I could just drop the whole thing and walk away from it.   I wasn't taking on a burden.  I was putting one down.



So that's what I did, and over time they seem to have added up to substantial change.  What I've really done is to choose life over death.  



I'm writing this partly to encourage those who feel they can't do it, pain, loneliness, fear, anxiety, sadness, or depression related to your drinking?  



If so, one day at a time.  Today can be the first day you make that decision, if you want it to be.  We are here to help each other.  This is what we do.  And it really does get easier, as long as we stay honest with ourselves.


Much love to everyone—

The biggest difference for me this time

I had tried to quit before, or worse someone else. I took advantage of free counseling offered by my work, started an anti-depressant, I went to SMART meetings, I joined /r/stopdrinking and continued working with a counselor and also looked deeper at myself as to why I was drinking. 

AA did not work for me as I do not believe alcohol has a power over me, have a stronger sense of identity, integrity and purpose. I am not religious, but feel that I am reborn and have an opportunity to be a different person than who I was, the further I get away from that person over time the more I realize I don't want to be that person again. 

I am now a better father, employee and human being. 

What is even better is that by being sober I can forgive myself and let go of the past, being who you are and true to yourself comes first.

It did not go well. ,TimeForTheTruth,48,6,24,"**Background:** My problem is that, or could mean I drink throughout each day for days or weeks. Any excuse to drink. My behaviour in the past has made me ashamed and frankly I suggest I’m rather emotionally stunted as a result of heavy drinking since early teens. Upset? Drink. Happy? Drink. Crying? Drink. Grieving? Drink. Deal with any emotions/thoughts? Na, this is not enjoyable. 


Anyway


Christmas was tough. I was pressured by my family (along with insults, ‘you’re no fun’) but didn’t relent. I did it! I was (and still am) a bit of a mess but taking one day at a time. I mentioned it to the family when discussing about the friends reunion and was met with narrowed eyes, a slightly tilted head and the expectation of a punch line. My explanations were vague, granted, but they arent that aware of my drinking. Due to shifts, we’re awake/asleep at different times, we generally stay fairly distant from each other  and getting wasted every night is acceptable (unless vomit is involved) if anyone so wishes in this residence.  


**The responses included:**

“Just go out drinking this one last time though. Stop after that if you want. If not

“If you’re worried about money

“You’re young. This is what you’re supposed to do”

“How about I buy you more alcohol

“Well

“How else are you going to enjoy yourself” (in response to me stating its healthier too)

“You’re too young (21) to decide to give up. I did the same [drinking] at your age”


**One positive comment:**

“You have more will power than me!”. 

And now I regret saying anything. And now regret giving up. Maybe I decided too soon. But honestly, thought processes, craving and fear. 


My friends say I have a reputation for being a drunk. I drink more than them


My family? Not drinking is insane. But for the first time in my life

I downloaded Craig Beck's *The Alcohol Lied To Me* almost immediately and it seriously just changed the whole way alcohol occurs for me. I read Allen's Carr book afterward and I didn't find it as effective

I don't know how to describe my experience without it sounding a bit unbelievable, like I was missing out while everyone was having fun, and as soon as my month was up I'd be straight back into the partying.

Halfway through reading the book, how stupid and unattractive they are. I saw how much money people dropped on it. It just seemed surreal. I haven't craved a drink since then.

After giving up alcohol

Those conclusions can be boiled down to a pretty simple hunch: if you drink regularly, how insidiously, it's working against your goals until you try going without it, at least for a little while.

I don't mean to sound like Carrie Nation's hatchet here, you don't have to be hitting the liquor store three times a day, or spending your weekends in the drunk tank, or puking in the bathroom at work, to at least pose the question of whether your life might be improved by the absence of alcohol. Especially if you're a part of this subreddit, looking to improve your life through conscious effort.

Alcohol is a cheap thrill. This is true as a simple matter of brain chemistry. It hot-wires your brain's reward system and drives off with it. And whereas your brain normally tends to cooperate with self-discipline, or connection with another human being, alcohol turns that equation on its head. Those positive activities become relatively less rewarding; the carrot at the end of the stick gets smaller.

For me, to take possession of my emotional states, in every aspect of my life. I no longer struggled (as much) to not overeat and to exercise. Books and articles I had been meaning to read for months were finished and placed back on the shelf. I felt productive and engaged at work, instead of bored and put-upon. I realized how many relationships I had been neglecting or taking for granted. It was like the volume was suddenly turned back up on the rest of my life.

And that's without even talking about the surge of energy. This is something people talk about a lot in connection with sobriety, bleary, twitchy insomnia. I wanted to be up and about and getting on with my life and doing things. If I'm being honest, it felt a little like that first hit of cocaine, except this was my body creating that feeling naturally. My days suddenly seemed to have more hours in them. 

And that brings me to my final point. Consider how much time alcohol costs. Consider how long you had to work to make the money you're drinking. Consider the hours, spent feeling, if not hungover, then just kind of off, sluggish, down. Consider whether the bars and liquor stores you patronize are places you would consider spending a nanosecond if they didn't have alcohol. Consider whether the Good Times you had with your drinking buddies seem nearly as good in retrospect as they did at the time. At best, it's all time not spent working towards your goals.

My point here is not to claim that everyone who drinks is an alcoholic

At the very least, or for two weeks, or for a month, or whatever makes sense to you. I promise that at least some part of the experience will surprise you. And if it turns out to be harder to give it up than you thought it would be, know that [help](http://aa.org/) is closer than you might think.

Drinking for me often resulted in unexpected consequences. In hindsight I guess none of the consequences should have been fully unexpected, and, ouch, there's some cuts and bruises I didn't really need. But seriously, they heal, and I wear pants and long sleeves to work anyway so big deal right? The point is, every time I drank it was like spinning the roulette wheel of unexpected consequences. Finally though

Now that I've been sober, it's something I can gladly do without. Improved motivation has encouraged me to take the necessary steps to understanding my anger and keeping it in check. My relationship with my S/O (never bad to begin with) has gotten even better. My sleep has improved. I feel more confident. My anxiety is way down. The future excites me more. I am encouraged to try new things. Life is just... better.

Guys, turns out I've had a home there for quite some time.

I hit the ground running at year 21, and decided I would take, you know, just one more shot.

After a few more one more shots, almost noon, and already my head was swimming.

I was, she has been a powerful presence in my life for a while now. I met her last year, and we'd hit it off from the start. Words flew between us like doves, and we recently became more serious. Between you and I, r/stopdrinking, I think I'm in love.

A couple of nights ago, she texted me and told me we had to talk about something (no more dreaded a phrase exists in the human language). I sat down and chatted with her over Facebook. She told me that I had blacked out and called her at midnight. I was rambling, incoherent, sometimes rude, and (she granted) funny at times. But I was floored. When I got home, I checked the bottle I had opened just the previous night. I had drank through most of a standard large bottle of whiskey.

So I gave myself an ultimatum. This girl should be livid or scared of me. If I was a man on the outside looking at the situation, and care, none of which I deserve for being so careless and negligent.

I've decided to stop cold turkey. It's been 48 hours since I last drank, and I'm resourceful enough to fill in the gaps.

I always thought alcohol made me smarter and more confident, I risk losing this girl I care so much about. She's given me a second chance, and I plan on getting myself to the point where I feel I deserve it.

I am 38, my company had an Oktoberfest celebration, a big gala in a giant tent at a farm.  I live a long way from work, so I booked a hotel, and a ride was provided to the event.  Things started fine.  During the dinner I was seated with my boss, which helped me keep things under control.  After that, I felt the need to loosen up a little.  I hit the sauce pretty hard and before I knew it the party was over.  I found two other people that were still interested in drinking

I woke up in an alley behind the club at around 5 the next morning.  It was still dark and I was still drunk. My major concern at the time was that my shoes were missing.  They were brand new, so I called a cab and went back to the hotel, passing out in bed.

The next morning I woke up at 10:30, I noticed that the top of my head was bleeding.  The skin had been scraped off in a circle about 3 inches in diameter.  The best I can surmise, I fell on my head which caused me to bite my tongue.  

When I went back to work on Monday (still feeling horrible), because I thought I saw you being escorted out of the club by two big guys.""  Embarrassed, I told him that the end of the night was fuzzy for me.  I'm not sure why I was thrown out, but I was probably getting sloppy.  Maybe I broke a glass or something.  I also have a tendency to be a smart ass when confronted with aggressive people.  But it seems that I was possibly thrown out and landed on my head, causing the injuries.

&gt; Start by stopping. 

&gt; Just don't take that first drink for one day. Go to bed sober and see how you feel when you wake up. Take that next day and vow to get through it without the first drink. Set a goal and see where it takes you, and promise yourself you can always get your misery back if you want it. Sure, there are lots of things you can obsess about. What about my friends? What do I do for fun? What do I tell people? How can I get through a stressful time? Do I need a therapist? What program should I use? Is it even a good time to try this? What if I fail?

&gt; Start by stopping. Just that.

It's been 30 hours sober. I've been feeling like a ball of fiery anxiety. I decided I'd go to an AA meeting. During the meeting I was on the verge of a panic attack. Not because I was nervous

I decided I was going to jump right in. I shared my story

The best part was after the meeting. I spoke with a man that was leading the meeting. I told him how bad I was feeling. Among other things

I went to the store and got a grapefruit drink and some jolly ranchers. I feel much better

(Throwaway because the person I'm with knows my reddit username

Not drinking for a few weeks has lead me to think that I may have a drinking problem.

I, my broken relationships with family, started to look after myself, quit smoking, limited getting drunk to a few times a week and in the last few months, it's really stepped up to a whole new level, I felt amazing, and trying to get into a routine

I broke up with a guy I was with during my ""dark days"" because I just couldn't hold it together. And we decided to get back together long distance a few months back, he said all the right things about getting back together. We got along so well. Or so I thought.

So he comes to visit

It was like sitting with a whole other person. I was looking at him thinking ""oh my god, oh god don't touch me"". Conversation went no where because this time I wasn't a rambling drunk, when he did talk, it bored me senseless. Also realised that he has a weird habit of cutting conversation dead when it starts to flow. He was rude. He was creepy. He was embarrassing.  

And then it hit me. He'd always been that way. But every time we were together, and then he was tolerable, even fun to be around. I didn't mind the disrespectful touching which I knew garnered concerned looks from onlookers. 

I tried again that weekend to go out with him, and then taking me to a normal bar and trying to force me to drink. 

I went home and thought that night. I hardly slept. Most of the relationships I've had, ~~but I felt lonely. Or not good enough for people I was interested in.~~because no one in their right mind would get involved with a mess, and I've been having to get in relationships for a long while in return for my booze, things I need generally (and formerly drugs) being paid for. I've had to drink to kill the horror of these people forcing themselves on me. I feel like I've had to basically let these horrible creepy men, who i'm not attracted to have their way for whatever reason, and had to get drunk or high to do that. 

I've saved as much money in this few weeks

I quit drugs

Hell, ANYTHING, like that in my life.

People haven't been laughing with me

Listerine.  It smells like Listerine.

So what can I say about being sober for thirty years? I have learned to face my fears and do what I have to do anyway. Maybe this is the reminder of one of sobriety's greatest gifts to me, one way or another: drinking and death. Or I can take one step at a time, one day at a time. Gather information. Ask about other people's experiences. Make informed decisions (or as informed as possible given the absurd nature of the universe). Realize that I have the right to make mistakes, especially when I'm learning (which is always). I have the right to change my mind, especially when I get new information or experience. 

I have the right to live in the day and go where it takes me. 

Fear doesn't have to be my master today. When I got sober, having a home, anything that adults frequently do without complaint. I couldn't imagine life without being completely anesthetized, and the further out of it I could get, the more unconscious and helpless, the better I liked it.

A few days later, so I was in a pretty vicious cycle of my formerly-helpful meds and formerly-lovable booze joining forces against me, and was a jangling, jittery mess of being tossed between their two extremes all day without a modicum of obvious impulse control to stop me.

So last Friday, that I had a problem - which was rough, as they are sheltered suburbanite types who had no idea and are teetotalers.  They handled it better than I expected, but it was a shock to the system right there.

We mutually agreed that detox was a good idea; frankly I was desperate for it

I did an inpatient program (I was lucky - great program, since it had been so long that I'd gone more than 12 hours without a drink.  I made a few friends out of my fellow patients that I'm still in touch with.  We're going meeting-shopping together.  I haven't slipped up and have only had slight cravings when something reminding me of my breakup has crossed my radar.  Liquor ads don't bother me, which I know is rare - just wedding ads/FB engagement announcements and the like.

Anyway, but I am very glad I did it.  I also am glad that you guys suggested meeting-shopping on my last post, because it really is true - every meeting is different, and stumbling upon a lame and alienating one my first time out is not reflective of the entire organization.  I did SMART Recovery, which was both the lame meeting and the helpful one(s) I've found since then.

I've tried to go to a meeting each night, and the company of my family who are doing a little ""baby-sitting.""  I felt pretty lame being an adult woman back home with her parents and having them look after me, but after detox and meeting hardcore drug users in detox (who, like in the movies, all had hearts of gold - your mileage may vary; I do not recommend seeking out smackhead friends on this basis) in various stages of alienation from their family members, I treasure mine more than ever.

Anyway, realistically, what I can and can't maintain long-term.  But the last time I touched a drink or the pills was a week ago tonight, so tomorrow morning, it will have been one week without alcohol in my system, a first not just in the past 4 months of depressed binge drinking, but the first generally in five years.  (I was a happy high moderate/low binge drinker pre-breakup.)

It's been a really awesome ride.  Just yesterday I had to answer the question of ""Have you lost weight? Like a **lot** of weight?  And recently?"" six times!  It feels awesome.  Just this morning

Besides that, my dog is sick, that cloud is a little grey, someone cut me off, ...  Maybe what's bothering me at that moment isn't really what's bothering me.  And reacting to what's in front of me might not be the best idea.

Not drinking has been relatively easy (so far).  I know I'm not special.  And I know that there will be a time when I'll get that stupid idea that I can drink responsibly again (I have already had weak thoughts like that).  But I know that if I do have ""real"" thoughts like that, use the resources I have at my disposal: r/stopdrinking, #stopdrinking (webchat in the side bar), private messages with people I've grown close to, talking to my therapist, and, most importantly

I feel like 6 months is a huge accomplishment.  I hadn't gone 6 months without drinking since I was in high school.  And, I stopped drinking during the week too"", I say, ""Oh no, I had to stop completely... I was drinking way too much.""

Not to exclude anyone

I think it's really important for people starting out to try to humble themselves and use the resources they have in front of them.  You don't have to be an ""AA-person"" and exclude your other options.  Use anything... everything that works for you.

My parents confronted me and offered my treatment after I was a victim of sexual assault and was beaten to a near pulp (I barely remembered anything because of how intoxicated I was). I refused. They never forced me to make any choices I didn't want to, and two black eyes. I never wanted to be so far away from a place before. It was hell. I felt like I could never relate to these people. After that I forget almost everything for several months. I just woke up one day out of my daze and went back to my parents for help. I don't remember exactly why I chose to sober up that day. It might have been a rough couple of weeks, maybe I was broke, maybe i really thought I needed help.

I call my mom and dad and tell that I will go. Within 3 days I was off to detox. I hated the place they sent me to. Forced religion down my throat (it doesn't help everyone) and the recovery coaches demeaned us by calling us women ""fucking cunts"" ""disgusting"". The only plus was that Kelly McGillis was one of my coaches and held me while I cried. Detox was rough. I'm sure I also sent many letters to people and I have no idea what they said.

I was really unhappy at this rehab and didn't want to move past detox. My family did some research and were able to get me a spot at G&amp;G Holistic in Miami on a ""scholarship"" and insurance covered most of it. That place saved my life. I didn't feel like a freak

I love being in control of myself. I love not drinking. I love it.

*What will make you feel better then?*

I don't know. It feels like nothing will.

*Then it doesn't matter what you do.*

And for some reason this thought releases me of all responsibility to make myself feel better which

*Maybe if you slow down and relax it'll come to you.*

*  A feeling of greed for more alcohol and more of a drunk.

*  Impatiently watching other people finish their drinks so I can ""acceptably"" order another
* Having a few drinks before an event or sneaking drinks at an event so people don't know the total number I've had
* Drinking more than I intend (happened more and more frequently towards the end).
* Structuring social events around drinking.

And the closer I will come to truly not being bothered.

The feeling I have right now is amazing. It's something I never thought I would ever experience again. My life is a lot easier

Prior to this run at sobriety I had never put together more than a month of not drinking and I had white knuckled it the whole time. When I'd hit the 30 day mark, but most importantly I focused on the present.

Today I don't have collectors calling my phone, and I keep being honest. Things don't change over night and life isn't going to be perfect, but its a hell of a lot more manageable. 

A week after my one year I lost a close cousin to cancer and 15 minutes later I received a phone call that my four month old Godson had passed away in his sleep. Not once did drinking come to mind. The only thought I had was how can I be there to help. That was huge for me

2. WE, we hope these pages will prove so convincing that no further authentication will be necessary. We think this account of our experiences will help everyone to better understand the alcoholic. Many do not comprehend that the alcoholic is a very sick person. And besides, we are sure that our way of living has its advantages for all. (Forward to First Edition)

3. On the other hand - and strange as this may seem to those who do not understand- once a psychic change has occurred, suddenly finds himself easily able to control his desire for alcohol, the only effort necessary being that required to follow a few simple rules. (Doctors Opinion)

4. Nearly all have recovered. They have solved the drink problem. (pg 17)

5. But, and an understanding which is indescribably wonderful. (pg 16)

6. The feeling of having shared in a common peril is one element in the powerful cement which binds us... The tremendous fact for every one of us is that we have discovered a common solution. We have a way out on which we can absolutely agree

7. There is a solution. (pg 25)

8. But we saw that it really worked in others

9. We have found much of heaven and we have been rocketed into a fourth dimension of existence of which we had not even dreamed. (pg 25)

10. The great fact is just this

11. The central fact of our lives today is the absolute certainty that our Creator has entered into our hearts and lives in a way which is indeed miraculous. (pg 25)

12. He has commenced to accomplish those things for us which we could never do by ourselves. (pg 25)

13. We, has proved to be the loving and powerful hand of God. A new life has been given us or, if you prefer, ""a design for living"" that really works. (pg 28)

I met up with a friend to go salsa dancing at a local nightclub.  I'd only ever been to this salsa club before while wasted off my ass and never been able to successfully dance.  This time I danced with at least four or five random guys and was actually able to pick up the rhythm of each person and have interested human interactions for four or five minutes at a time.  Some of the guys might have been drunk but I wasn't!

After a couple hours there (wow... staying on the dance floor at a bar for two hours) I realized that another close by bar was closing and I wanted to check out their music before the bar closed.

After bar closing time I hit up a house party.  This was at like 3am and instead of being wasted

Made it home and into bed by 5am on Saturday morning after having spent less than $10 to dance and socializing and party my way across town.  If I had still been drinking I probably would have just gotten shitfaced at the salsa club

From day one of my trip, of getting up and going to work before I poured as much beer down my neck - meant I was not an alcoholic. 

There were very few days where at least a bottle or two would not my lips, who was to say I had a problem. I began to notice I may drank a few too many looking back through my previous few months photos tagged on Facebook for 90% of them to contain some sort of Alcohol in my hand or in my close proximity (Empty bottles lying next to my lifeless body) Yet still - ""Holidays"" (A word shouted by a few of my close drinking buddies (alcoholics) as an excuse for us to drive at 6am still drunk from the night before to stock up for the day)

This is where I should have realised, I would meet fellow drinkers who were exactly the same. I never stopped to think that most of the travellers I met, were just away for 6 months to a year who had there money saved up to party. I, on the other hand, had no prospects, no plans on going home to Uni, and just wanted to carry on having fun (drinking) 

In the end I met a German girl in NZ which resulted in me leaving my drinking buddies behind, done it for years"", which was pretty much true, and normal to me. After a few months binging and spending the remaining for my British money I left at home, I started working in McDonald's. If I was not an alcoholic before this, I certainly was after. Basically, I was the little Welsh shit that would do the shit jobs because he cant speak German. I survived two months

Its been about 3 months since then, still costly. Moved onto the Spirits and the 10% Faxe beer.. what a mess. Problems began to arise in our relationship, I was make decisions on where we went depending not just on the availability of alcohol, but drinking partners. Times have gotten quite lonely in Germany, turning to the bottle seemed a good way to escape, at least for the day, and the next and the next. 

- This is the changing point in my life -
This went like this for a while until last Sunday. Had an argument with the misses over going back to the parents, buy 3 10% 1 litre cans and head to the last day of a Reggae festival. Long story short - Very drunk, police asking me questions, I lie (I wanted to know why they need my name, I had done nothing wrong) The ran it through and told me I don't exist, me being drunk and rowdy - ""Fuck you, I am sitting here, I guess they thought I was resisting as 2 more decided to jump on top and try to strap my hands together. This was brutal - serious - bruised eye, you feel something but its not feeling as you know it. I was taken to a police station where I had sobered up heaps during my ordeal and asking them why I was being arrested. They told me I was drunk and ""helpless"" and they were doing it to protect me! I showed a different officer my bruises and said how is this protecting me?? He simply shrugged it off, he replied ""50 minutes"". In the end I spend 10 hours in a locked cell with 1 cup of water and no food. I could not call anyone to let them know where I was

So any ways, I thought it was going to be difficult, but now after writing all this and remembering enough is enough. No more excuses for a little sip. I need money. I need my health.

Let me start this off with I know I am a fuck up. I know the things I do are completely innapropriate and dangerous. I know there could be major consequences for my actions, these things I do make me the worst mother and could result in my child being taken from me.  Please, constructive critisicm when it comes to my daughter.


If I don't keep this vague it's going to run miles long...I need therapy I know.


When I turned 14 I got my first serious boyfriend

I immediately got into another relationship, he sleeps, smokes and drinks.  Then starts to beat me when Im 9 months pregnant. The behavior lasted until my daughter was one year old until I told my mother and she made me get rid of him. Immediately after I rekindled an old flame.  

We dated for 8 months

I lost him. My friends. My security. I was fearful of my future. I felt like a horrible mother. I felt worthless


When I got out they had recommended in patient alcohol rehab. I denied thinking I could control myself, almost as my rock, but we are only friends now) knocked sense into me and paid for the abortion.  Guilt led to drinking every night, weather out with friends or at my house. Waking up every morning to my beautiful daughter hung over as fuck, but, I worked it. I pretended to be happy and silly, made huge breakfast, get my child from day care


I keep this up until the new year. My resolution is to only go out for special occasions. But theres a bar right up my street so my fucked up brain makes anything a special occasion so I spend atleast 3-5 nights a week with my bar friends, we are all greater friends since I have been drinking there so much, they like to share their coke with me. Which is where things just get worse.

Now

I black out atleast once a week. I have two-four boys I constantly fuck with their emotions. I'll black out and wake up with one in my bed and act like I meant to and just think ""well here it goes again with **

I feel guilt over everything. How I treat these men, how CPS could take her from me if they figured me out, how I spend ALL of my money on alcohol to the point where I need to save up and get away from the place that enables me to do this but vodka water seems better,  how I don't deserve my daughter, how I think about killing myself every single day. 

So why...the fuck...don't I stop?

Well...Im on day 3. This crucial day I get to every couple weeks where I end up drinking at night.  I can't do it this time.  I have to wait. I have to stay my happy ass at home

I got thrown into a Human Resources position at my job.  I can't fuck this up.  I can't lose my girl.  I can't keep living like this.  


I hate myself. I am going to try so hard to make it tonight, so I could just kill myself and no one would need to deal with my shit anymore)

When Sundays &amp; Thursdays come

I did better last week.

Im doing better than that this week.

And I haven't let anyone convince me I can just do a line of coke and not fuck my whole night up in almost 2 weeks.

But I just feel like I cant cut it out completely.  I want to be able to moderate

It's such a fucked up feeling


When I type this it looks like that inpatient rehab might be my best bet.  But....the idiot with in says ""no


I guess, I will not do cocaine, and I will not black out. I will have the bartenders cut me off when they see me do my typical ""too drunk"" things.

And if/when that bites me in the ass and proves to not be a useful tactic...it's time to go to AA and get a grip on this.  

Im 22 years old with an almost 3 year old, live on our own and have a kick ass life that I know I can create if I just stop being selfish for more that 2 days.

Other things I hate about my drinkjng is I used to tiny flat stomached and gorgeous


(sidenote- my child has never met a guy I have dated. Do not believe in introducing her to people for the fuck of it)

Wow....that came out longer than I wanted....if anyone actually read all of that....thank you.

And not in a maybe-one-day it will kill me sort of way, I know it's from my drinking. 3 months ago I lost my job because of my drinking but because I'm such a good liar I managed to convince everyone that because of the downturn in the markets they had to let me go.

The truth is I was so hungover everyday that I just couldn't be fucked to do my job.

I want so much more in my life than to want to drink

I know I need to talk to my wife about this. I know she ignores my drinking because she loves me. And without her I know I would dissolve into a liquid mess and disappear.

I don't want to do this anymore. I need help.

My wife and I almost divorced this summer.  Part of it was my drinking

In August she took the kids and moved out.  It was a wake-up call.  I went through the house that night and poured every drop down the sink.  I did it for me

The first week or so was hell.  I didn't know what to do with myself.  So much of my life had been booze, crafting.  I poured myself into my legal studies.  I started going to the gym and watching my diet more.  I used the extra money to buy a wardrobe that wasn't old and stodgy.  Most of all, I spent a hell of a lot of time with my kids.

And my wife.  At diners

She told me how much I'd changed.  How I was getting back to being the sweet

We ended up falling in love all over again.

She and the kids moved back in two months ago, and I'm starting to realize how much of it I missed in the bottom of a bottle or a glass.

I cannot believe how well I sleep now and how delightful it is to feel my eyelids get heavy and my book hit my chest every night as I wind down in bed.

AA has been awesome and I also could never have fathomed how wonderful and supportive everyone has been.  They approach you after meetings, just a warm hello and an invitation to sit together at the next meeting.  I am loving AA so much and bonding so well with the people I meet there.  The one thing I keep taking away from it is the incredible strength and power these people all have.  Especially the old-timers.  For someone to get through this and stay clean, and be of service to others who need help, and be calm and confident in their sobriety.  Man, that's POWER.  That's SEXY!

1338313898.0,uamyl,My story so far.,VictoriaElaine,41,5,18,"Hey guys! As many of you know

I live in Ottawa and grew up here. I won't go through all the places I moved but basically, but for me, having alcohol more readily available was a curse and a blessing.

I started drinking once in awhile in my teens, and am a perfectionist.

I've been riddled with addictive tendencies since I was 18 and diagnosed with anorexia. Alcohol came later. But regardless of how it manifested, GOOD THINGS ARE SUPPOSED TO CONSTANTLY HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE.

I never really failed at anything. I'm a stubborn bitch when it comes to getting my way. When I put my mind to something

I found my bottom pretty quickly. I was drinking alcoholically by the age of 21 but NEVER thought it was a problem. I thought I was just a lush. A party girl. I thought I drank like everyone else. And no one told me I drank too much because they were probably afraid of the reaction I might have.

I went through the progression from abusing alcohol to alcohol dependence pretty quickly. I think dependence came about when I was 22. That's when I started to NEED alcohol at least every three days. I didn't care if I was alone or with others. I just needed to drink. Didn't think it was a problem though.

Alcohol started to take its toll. My ex boyfriend told me that I needed to stop because I was getting so fucking crazy when I drank. I'd pass out in weird places

I tried to quit for good in October 2010. I lasted three weeks, it was different. I needed to drink. Nothing would stop me from getting what I wanted, and that was booze and cigarettes.

I stopped going to school. I thought that drinking off hangovers was a good idea

This is when I started hiding booze all over the apartment. Before that I had even hidden mickeys of vodka and 26's of vodka around the house incase I ""needed it"". I wasn't allowed to openly drink

In 2011, and finally decided to go to Homewood but it took me a couple months to get in. I drank hard and heavily until I got there. It was fucking hell.

I was suicidal. I wanted to die some days

I had my last drunk on May 27th 2011. I went for a ""run"" which was typically just an excuse to get to the liquor store extremely quickly. I didn't want to drink. I checked my bank account and I had 20.63 left. Enough to take out 20 dollars so I could buy a bottle. My dad has access to my account and can see where money is being spent and I didn't want him to see ""wine store: 15 dollars"" on the computer screen. He checked it regularly to see if I was drinking.

So I bought a 1.5 liter bottle and drank it on the way home. I cried my eyes out drinking it. I stared at it, but I did. And something happened that night. All I wanted to do was spend that Friday night with my parents and sister watching TV, but instead I was chugging wine in a forest.

I went to rehab on June 1st for 35 days. I learned a lot there. I was told to go in without any of my bullshit. But I was really lucky because on my last drunk

I needed rehab too. I knew that AA was not going to be enough. I needed and wanted constant 24 hour supervision

I got that in rehab. I hated AA when I was in the institution. Thought it was total bullshit. But I listened to my counsellors. I went every night

I've been through a lot in this year. I have blessings I never thought possible. I have the support and love from my family. I have a supportive and loving partner back (Kevin

I've also become less co-dependent. I was so attached to men. They were everything to me. I needed their constant attention and their sex to let me know I was worthy and beautiful. 

I now go to AA meetings daily because I WANT TO. Which is fucking strange. I love the fellowship. I love my friends in the program. I love hanging out with other alcoholics and addicts because they GET ME. For the first time in my life

I celebrated one year on Monday morning at my home group. I was told I wear my sobriety like a badge of honour. And I do. I am honest and open about my alcoholism. I don't hang out with people who think I still drink. I keep myself SAFE and I am adamant about protecting what I have.

My sobriety and my safety is the most important thing in my life. I live on day to day terms, and I can deal with it then.

Time passes regardless of what we do with it. It's going to be tomorrow at some point. So

At the weekend I may have a visitor or I may go into town. I go to a couple of bars and drink coffee and bottled water. I watch the drunks. I may meet a friend. None of my friends are drinkers and I only have a few close friends. I might treat myself to a Thai curry and I might kiss a girl.

This is from the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous.

This was a big problem for me trying to get sober. I had great difficulty giving up on the idea that somehow, but coming to the conclusion that I would never be able to drink like a normal drinker was by far the most difficult part of getting sober.

When I started going to AA, I poured the bottle out afterwards. But there were days I skipped the meeting and drank the bottle instead. I was still trying to find a way to drink even though I wanted the benefits that sobriety offered.

This went on for about 3 and a half months of going to AA meetings. Luckily, ""If I don't feel better after the meeting, I'll drink tomorrow"" , and I quit buying bottles before the meetings. I was finally able to go 24 hours without buying a bottle. I have not had a drink since then.

I've put together a number of years of sobriety now, but it is still there.

* 28 years old
* Drinking near-daily for about 3 1/2 years. (Longest stretch of *total* sobriety in this time was 14 days.)
* Diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Anxious/Avoidant Personality Disorder. The theory for my drinking is that I started as a means of self-medicating
* Been in therapy since early last summer. Recently started medication. My doctors are aware of my drinking.
* I have an alcoholic father (though he's currently sober)
* I've been successfully cutting back on my alcohol consumption. 

**I'm tired of using alcohol as a crutch though**, hurt the few personal relationships I have, and has even stolen my other hobbies. (I used to play guitar a lot, play involved role playing video games, and I absolutely *loved* weight training. Drinking came to replace those probably 75% of the time, which kind of breaks my heart, as corny as that may sound.) 

Now, is not my goal. (I am hoping I can still fit in here, but we'll have to see how the community responds.) Instead, I want to keep my drinking within a medically healthy range and avoid binging as a means of self-medicating. 

I completely understand that many people need to cut out alcohol completely, as someone prone to perfectionism, attempts to commit 100% to something usually gets me into big trouble. So, a successful day for me is a day when I either don't drink at all, **or** when I stick within a normal, healthy range. Should I exceed that range, I will request to have my badge reset.

Having said that all that, I still feel like I *need* at least little, especially when I'm anxious. I'm really bothered by that compulsion, but I'm not ready to fully kick its ass yet. Hopefully, through therapy, medication, and continued cutting-back I'll be able to reach that state in the near future.

My alcoholic brain told me over and over again how much I was missing out on because I didn't drink

Well, people who don't like the taste of alcohol, social drinkers, people who have grown out of the party scene, crafy beer connoisseurs who only drink it for the taste, etc.  In other words, NON-alcoholics.  In my life I don't think I've really ever had a close relationship with a true non-alcoholic.  All my friends are either sober or drinking alcoholics.  

After getting dumped because I don't drink, they are usually the driver, they don't like being drunk, etc.  To me, this is MIND BLOWING.  I was never a light drinker and I never hung out with people who could take it or leave it.  

I don't even know what this post is for.  I just wanted to say that I feel like a whole new section of the world opened up for me.  I guess this was prompted because I got yet another birthday invite for one of my friends in their late 20s where the focus was booze, and how many ways can we drink, how many bars can we go to, how messed up can we get.  When I get these I feel like such an outcast.  But not everyone is like that, and I want to spend my time with people who don't make drinking a priority anymore. 

Just my thoughts :)

I went to a meeting

I went home and started thinking about how my behaviour was totally setting me up for relapse. I wasn't being open

I had two realizations.

1. Comparing myself to other people is just another way I stay sick. I have no idea what is going on in their inner lives

2. Normal people probably do what they need to do to get themselves through a day. And therefore

So I read my daily reflections/meditations. I realized that I hadn't taken my medicine that day yet (talking, willing, doing the things I need to do).

Then I had a better day. I felt ME again. Me is working recovery, being open and being willing.

We have sold or pawned half our possessions since December of last year to accommodate our affliction.

When we pulled up to the place there were 2 cars in the parking lot with 10 minutes to go before the meeting.  So far off we were off to an uneasy start.  It turns out most people parked in the back (duh :-).  I do not need to give a play-by-play but one of the things I garnered most from the meeting was I need to talk to other alcoholics.  It was so eye-opening and even comforting to hear people share stories, and inflections in their voice…a whole group of people from all walks of life suffering the same thing as you.  The guy to our left was anti-religious from his own mouth but he said he needed to be there.

Do not be afraid to get help.  We had two moments of silences for the people not at a meeting and still suffering.  My heart aches for you and I.

1367095429.0,1d8gcl,Things I like about sobriety. Things I dislike about drinking,IceTeaPlease,40,5,16,"Positives that I've noticed after stopping drinking:

Energy! 

Generally feeling healthier

I can remember what I did last night! And the night before!

No more waking up covered in shame from not knowing what I did or said the night/day before. 

Being able to make plans without worrying about if I will be too hungover to follow through with plans.

Less fighting with my boyfriend. Spending more quality time together. Watching sunsets. 

Focused more on friends instead of just getting trashed and what should I drink next? 

Saving money and being able to afford car payments now. I'm saving over $300 a month by not drinking. 

Being successful in not drinking for 40 days has given me strength to make other goals and start working to meet those goals. Weight loss goals

My home is staying cleaner. Not spotless but things like taking out the garbage or cleaning up a spill don't get ignored for weeks.

I am taking better care of my hygiene... much more likely to brush my teeth at night if I'm going to bed instead of passing out on the couch or the floor. 


Along with things I am enjoying with my new sobriety

Night sweats. One of the times I realized I really had a problem was when I went to wash the sheets and I noticed my side of the bed was stained with sweat marks while the other side was spotless. It was very disgusting looking at the physical proof of what my drinking was doing.

I don't wake up throughout the night and need to get up and chug water because I feel like I'm going to die without it. Also not chugging water in the morning before work to try and curb a hangover and then feeling so bloated and nauseated. Sleeping better in general now

I don't want to smoke as often. I still let myself once in awhile

I hate sounding drunk and slurring my words. Saying things to complete strangers that should have remained private. Talking to guys with the intention of trying to get free drinks. 

Losing hours of time. Waking up with no memory of drunk facebook/text/actual conversations. Feeling like others were gossiping about me. Getting a bad reputation in this small community. So many MYSTERY BRUISES. Making up semi-plausible stories to explain huge bruises. 

Consuming a couple days worth of calories in a single drinking binge. And then craving junk food. Wanting to lay around all day everyday. Wasting whole paychecks on one evening at the bar.

This has meant a shift in sobriety techniques.  Lately a familiar little voice has been cropping up, after my two one-year stints of not drinking, I would have given in to this voice.  But that was before I had educated myself about alcoholism and the workings of the inner addict.  Now I just observe this voice with some detachment, saying, Yep, there it is.  I feel in no danger of giving in to it.  I am not threatened by the existence of this voice.  I don't pretend it doesn't matter, because I firmly believe in the ancient dictum of never underestimating the enemy.  And this voice is definitely the enemy.  It's the enemy of my higher self, now that it is free of the constraints of constant drunkenness and hangovers.   

I am surrounded by constant reminders of the rewards of sobriety.  My career has taken off again.  My financial situation has improved vastly

I go to meetings once a week.  These have become important to me.  I have a sponsor who I call sometimes.  I see a therapist occasionally.  I reach out to others and I allow myself to be reached.  I feel that I have an understanding of a Higher Power that works for me

--

Thirty days ago I had just recently broken up with my boyfriend, I wasn't super motivated at school, and I had no summer job prospects. I decided to write a letter at 4am on April 12. It was to myself. I decided to stop drinking.

Thirty days later I have a new job, and was able to be so much help to my mom, and my family in general. I would not have been able to do that had I been drinking. I would have been an emotional mess, and wouldn't have been much help. I've even found a new guy, who, in retrospect, is much better suited for me. He's involved much more than my previous relationship. We have real dates

I've had some hard moments this month. The moments where I would normally feel like having a drink are still there, biking, whatever. I've also noticed I've been building much better relationships with everyone. I'm much more open, and honest. I have made a few amends with people that I would otherwise have not made. I'm slowly turning my life around one day at a time. Things are looking up, and starting to gain momentum.

The most powerful things that I have learned are as follows:

Alcohol is a symptom of my disease.  We hear this a lot from various sources.  I can tell you my cravings only stopped once I realized that I was having trouble with my outlook, and pain was there still,  only now I was an angry asshole.  The next morning it was still there and I had a hangover to ad to my list of troubles.  Around the third month of sobriety,  I changed my outlook. People will always act a certain way,  things will always fall apart at times.  How I reacted had to change. Ultimately I needed to just calm down and look forward to tomorrow.  Sure,  people may still bother me, (and maybe they always will)  I am a misanthrope after all,  but the sun still rises every day.  Recognizing the potential beauty of life and it's temporary nature is what changed my outlook.  Though life is not static

I vividly remember talking to a friend, about cutting down. I remember joking about having a problem. 

Sure, but drinking less and on fewer occasions would just be a matter of exercising some self-control. Something to do in a few years when we're less young. Something to do along with better eating, working out, more discipline. Fitter. Happier. More productive...

Still, 'only x beers'. Shouldn't be too hard, right?

Of course I failed.

Even worse, and I'd end it by almost unconsciously buying some beers, drinking them, and in the process forgetting that I had decided not to drink that day.

And *that's* what scared me the most

If my dependency is so strong that it can 'make' my brain forget about it

I feel my dependency crossed a line. 

I didn't mind feeling feeble all day because I drank too much the day before. I didn't mind feeling tired all day because I had to get up at four to take a massive piss and I couldn't get back to sleep. I didn't mind that most of my evening hours were wasted to films and junk food

Really

But that's really the problem, and shit.

I don't hate the drinking; I hate the thinking.

No single thing should have so much control over the mind

So it's time to get back into the driver's seat

So anyways, I'm beginning to think that my take from the program will simply be to have a 'shot in the arm' in terms of my social life--which has nose dived.

But it nose dived in a way that I didn't anticipate. Most people conjecture that when you give up drinking, is that I'm not 'giving them up' because of their drinking perse, but because they're proven themselves to be kind of shitty.  I've been blown off, flaked on a lot recently. 

But I realize is that I've probably been blown off and flaked on for years but never noticed because I was too busy being drunk and flaking on and blowing off other people. Lame

It's like I had been just sliding through life on the bear minimum expectation of what bonds friends together for so long that I never realized how lame I had become.

I hope that makes sense.

My drinking was never one where I *had* to have a drink in the morning, I would search out new drinking friends at the hotel bar or some other bar that was open.  Those nights never generally ended well.  The next morning, I would never remember what or how I ended up where I ended up.

Funny thing is that my career skyrocketed while I was drinking.  I was the “fun” guy.  Looking back

Because alcohol never impacted my career
Well a year later, 4, or 5am without drinking.  In the mornings, I’m just exhausted, but not hung over.

My biggest fear has been what would people think when they find out that I don’t drink?  Honestly, don’t give in and people will know it’s for real.  Make no apology.  “Sorry, I don’t drink.” Shouldn’t have to be a valid excuse.  There’s no reason to apologize.  If someone offers you a drink, politely decline.  If they push, “No thank you, I don’t drink”.  Everyone leaves it at that.

The only time I’ve run across any issues or people *really* pressuring is generally late at night when everyone is drunk.  At that point, he’ll be hurting.  I won’t.  And they *always* hurt in the morning.  Watching “that guy” with a hangover is my form of comedy. 

It’s been a great year.  Nothing magical happened when I quit drinking.  People didn’t have a parade for me.  Balloons didn’t drop from the ceiling and there were no fireworks.  The anxiety was all in my head.  Life carried on.  My life or career didn’t get magically better, and I have a much better outlook on sober life.

Sobriety can easily be just as fun as a drinking life.  It takes a bit getting used to

**Childhood:**

I was born to a single mother who met my stepfather when I was about the age of 3. I call him my stepfather because he's been around since I was young but they never married. This man was to be my role model during my formative years. He is also an alcoholic as is my mother.

I always felt loved by both of my parents but around the age of 10 or 11 it was quite apparent that they no longer felt love for each other. Nightly fights, and unwarranted accusations, became the norm for me. I saw my stepfather (and continue to see him do this) drink in excess on a nightly basis. All the while I would be dragged into their fights by my mother, asking me to take a side and watching her be hurt when it wasn't her side that was chosen. 


Because of this


There were many many instances where I was afraid because my stepdad was driving drunk with myself and my mother in the truck. One instance of this was on Christmas Eve when we were driving home from his families house. It was icy and just generally shitty weather and my mother said something along the lines of ""Be careful."" This set my stepdad off on a rampage. He stopped the truck

I've really only recently started to learn what a healthy relationship actually looks like.

**Adolescence:**

I didn't really drink until my junior year in high school. About a handful of times

I never really fit into one certain clique in high school. I was always kind of on the outer edge of any given one. I went through all the different ones trying to find some kind of acceptance, goth phase, and a punk phase all in one year! That shit is tiring! In essence, what I was trying to do was mask who I really was, someone who I wasn't entirely sure that I liked, by putting on a plethora of masks in the hope that I would find acceptance from other people. Saying what I thought would gain me the most acceptance from others so that I could accept myself. I was trying to gain external acceptance to find one internally (sound familiar?)

**Adulthood:**

Let's fast forward to about the age of 19. I've met a girl that I felt I had connected with and fast track an engagement as her parents are moving to Tennessee (currently in Michigan). I end up moving down there with her so she can be with her parents, we move back up to MI and I get my old job back and eventually a promotion to assistant manager. Things are going well for a bit until they're not. We start drifting apart and it all comes to a head when she finds texts in my phone to another woman. Nothing graphic but enough to push our relationship off the edge. It had been on its way for awhile and I don't blame her for it. She ended up leaving me and moving back in with her parents down South that day.

Now what was unique about the day that this happened was that it was my birthday. Specifically

At that moment it was off to the races. I was drinking almost daily while I let my resentments towards her, or whatever excuse I needed, build up inside my head. Eventually I let it go but drinking already had its hooks in me. I was going out with friends and getting drunk around 4 nights a week and getting home with no recollection of how I had done it. I ended up having to move in with my parents for a little bit until I finally moved in with a co-worker and a mutual friend. (I have some pretty hilarious non-drinking stories about those two. Messiest roommates I've ever lived with. Ask me about it sometime if you're ever in the IRC.)

For the next few years my existence consisted of working and drinking. If I wasn't doing the latter in between bouts of work

After court fees/fines, I ended up dating one of my exes from back in the day. Let me tell you something…there's a reason why people are your ex. That was a bad idea!

Eventually I lost my job. I worked for a company that didn't really ""get with the times"" and their model for business became outdated. Honestly

At first everything was alright and I'd spend time with her and her son. We became close. Then it slowly started falling apart faster and faster. Instead of washing my hands of the situation, either.

I would get a 6 pack of high ABV beer (~10%) and a few tall cans of shitty beer for after my sense of taste was diminished. I would use the excuse that I was only drinking about 9 beers. In reality I was drinking about 15-18 drinks compared to the ABV of the average American beer. I would do this between 3-5 times a week.

This continued for another couple of years and then **BAM!** DUI number 2! That was the eye-opener I needed. It finally clicked! All the years of justifying my drinking

**Sobriety:**

Since that day, I will have more and more until I am physically unable to continue. I've gone to AA and posted in this sub and used any support I can get when I'm feeling weak.

Gone are the nights of passing out while I have a pizza in the oven

This didn't all come at first. I was still a mess when I first quit drinking. There were times when I felt like picking up a drink to make the pain and hurt go away again. At those times I would reach out. When I'm feeling weak

For the first several months I didn't want to get a sponsor or really work the steps

Today I know that nothing that happens is worth taking a drink over. I can handle any situation much better without a clouded mind and stumbling over my words. Life may not be perfect

I want to leave anyone still reading with this:

You can do this. You can live a life that's free from alcohol. When you're weak, SMART, this subreddit…whatever, there will always be somebody willing to listen. For anyone who's still considering quitting, know this: you don't have to continue digging. You can stop this today. Today can be the beginning of a beautiful, fulfilling life!

Now you're probably wondering why you don't hear much about Sobriety™ and more about our competitor, but well fell hard on our face. We just weren't able to keep up with the amount a PR work the team over at Alcohol does. Their marketing department is brilliant and very well funded. From the time you grew up, you we're bombarded daily about all the great benefits of Alcohol and how it helps you have a good time. It's not just in commercials, but their product placement is deeply embedded in our television, movies, music, and culture in general. It's impossible to go a 
whole day without being exposed to some sort of advertising by Alcohol. What's more, let the products speak for themselves. Who looks like they're more satisifed with life: those who are using Sobriety™, or those using Alcohol?

To be fair

1) Less consciousness and impaired brain function

The bartender was awesome and gave me all the water/soda and even some food for free. That was a cool perk. I think he sensed that I was tasked with taking care of my bandmates.

Another huge thing was the day after, I was now not only accountable to myself, but to my bandmates too. Big help.

I haven't shared my whole story with anyone yet and I wanted to get it out. It was therapeutic for me and that was my motivation.

DISCLAIMER: THIS IS A BRAIN DUMP AND IT IS A LONG ONE. 

I am 32 and I had slowly become alcohol dependent over the course of 13 years. I also smoked pot everyday for those 13 years. In the beginning things were great. I didn't drink through High School. I couldn't wait to go to college because I had a pretty abusive father and barely any friends due to the fact we moved about 60 miles when I was 13. If you've ever been 13

When I left for college I got a fresh start and met people left and right. I was in my prime at that point. I joined a fraternity with some of the friends I made in the dorms. I wasn't a big drinker then but I was introduced to other substances. I was a Computer Science major and spent a lot of my time on assignments or studying. Alcohol was ever present and I drank my share but it didn't create any problems for me during school. My girlfriend and I eventually broke up mostly because I wasn't willing to fully commit. The last year of college I drank a ton

I graduated, but I never blacked out. I'm a goofy drunk and like to cause trouble, but not the violent kind. Eight months later I got the opportunity to move to Germany for ten months and took it. I was 24. 

I remember I drank on the flight. We arrived at 6am and I drove to my new apartment. I walked in the door and cannot the forget my first thought - “what now?” - I panicked. I couldn't sleep the first night and this is when I started self medicating. I walked to a gas station down the street and bought a six pack. I drank them all and then passed out. The next day, English, Croatian, Polish and the Americans from the military base nearby. It was awesome and eye opening for a 24 year old American. For nine months this continued and alcohol just became the norm. I didn't realize what a crutch it had become and the progressiveness of alcoholism.

I returned back to the states and the next eight years are a little blurry. I drank a lot and blacked out a lot. So did a lot of my friends so it seemed OK at the time. Girlfriends came and went (and went mostly due to the alcohol problem). Then I met the black widow. She was awesome – super artsy

This is when I started drinking a fifth a day. I did that for two years. I got into other things – a couple months of pain pill addiction after I fractured my foot in a drunken accident. I had a little love affair with coke and fucked around with shrooms. It was just a normal thing for me by this point. The spiral continued and my work relationship got worse. I was missing a lot of it and my boss was getting pissed. I was a top performer for about seven years and he couldn’t figure out what was wrong with me all of a sudden. He allowed me to miss work and call out all the time. I was definitely resting on my laurels and used his leniency so I could spend my days drinking. 

A little under a year ago I was up to a half gallon of Vodka a day and about a pint of Scotch. I was on a business trip and at this point I was so exhausted...mentally and physically from trying to keep my life in order while being blacked out or passed out most of the time. On the last day of the trip I had a seizure and was unconscious for about 20 minutes. This was because I didn’t have a drink for about fifteen hours. I went to the ER

I lost my license due to the seizure and state law and my boss let me work from home. I was in heaven. I drank non stop for about three weeks and took heavy doses of librium and dilantin. I don't remember how much I drank in this period but it was a lot. 

And then a miracle happened. I, dark, depressing, resentful pit I was in. Finally one night he asked me who runs my family. You know – the responsible one that keeps the family together. I sent him my brother number and at about 8pm my friends starting showing up at my apartment one by one. I was so dumb drunk at the time I just thought they were all coming over to keep me company and make sure I didn't kill myself. I was enjoying a Vodka and Gatorade on my back porch, shooting the shit with one of my friends, when my brother and sister in law showed up. He told me I'm coming with him and I'm going to rehab. My friends packed my bag, cleaned the red Gatorade puke off the wall and toilet in my bathroom and locked the place up. I love them all.

I got to rehab and had no idea what was going on. They were taking my vitals

I look back at my old journal from rehab to remind myself of the small things in life. Just seeing colors again was amazing to me. Music, writing. Before sobering up my eye sight was so busted colors weren't vivid and my nervous system was so screwed I couldn't control my hand to write. I could barely sign the credit card receipt at the liquor store.

I got through detox without another seizure. I didn’t sleep much and got really into the structure of rehab. I needed it and it worked well for me. I met a lot of great people and learned a ton. I was let go after 23 days and made a really tough decision to go to a recovery house instead of back home to living alone. I would have drank eventually if I went home and I knew it. This was the tough decision that I had to make

I have learned to live again – my top recovery song is probably “Walk” by the Foo Fighters (corny I know). It really is like being an infant and learning everything again for the first time. Everything is a learning experience and every time I do something good for myself I am fighting the bad side of me and beating it. Every experience, I get stronger. 

I worked and continue to work really hard at recovery – rehab

I have to mention, it helped me too. I now know when I'm beginning to rely on any one thing too much. I can play a video game for 9 hours straight, I can over eat, I can go buy unnecessary things. But I realize that every time I do that I am delaying my recovery and delaying becoming the person I want to be. And none of these things make me happy.

I attend AA regularly but it's more or less to socialize and hear the stories of other people. I also feel very much at home in AA. It's almost like a party and it keeps me on track. I followed the steps the best I could and got a really great sponsor. I do not believe in God

I can be around alcohol now and I don't mind telling a waitress that I'm a recovering alcoholic when she starts the beer specials. I can see my friends again while they drink and have real interactions with them. I am becoming whole again and it feels FANTASTIC. Life is good and I now have control over my thinking

That's all I got. If you read this far I thank you kindly for your time and the princess is in another castle. Keep up YOUR awesome work and I wish you much happiness and health.

In closing – I will always remember what my sponsor told me when I celebrated my first anniversary - “That's great...now get another day.” His point was that it's not how much time you have sober but what you are doing with that time. Which reminded me of Gandalf's quote from LoTR - “All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us."" 

Namaste.

tl;dr: I'm an alcoholic...a terrible terrible sot. I quit drinking nine months ago today and I'm getting better. I also don't blame you because this shit was loooooong.

*But it doesn't matter, and it is no longer pleasurable to drink.* I've been a heavy drinker for about 8 years, and I've been exploring ways to cut back or moderate since 2008. My drinking isn't as heavy as it was 6 or 7 years ago, but the pattern and my lack of control are scaring me now. Here comes a wall of text. Bear with me.

Here is what has really changed things: I recently started taking a medication (SSRI) that seems to remove my ""shut off switch"" when I would normally realize I'd had enough to drink and stop. On a ""normal"" heavy drinking night, I continue past that to 8-10 drinks until there is no more booze or I pass out. Even more distressing is the fact that I have browned out about 5 times in the last 7 months--and with the new medication, it has happened more frequently. This is something I have never experienced before. It also affects my hangovers--they aren't nearly as bad as usual, I just feel ""foggy"" and confused. This tells me that my body has changed, and I need to listen to it.

I had my first embarrassing drinking experience last month at a wedding, not stopping until I crawled into bed. The first night, I had half a bottle of champagne and 4 or 5 beers. The second night, a bottle of red wine and some beers. The third, ""just"" four beers, but I had only intended to have 2 or 3. 

Counting drinks is exhausting. Trying to moderate is exhausting. Thinking about the next time I can drink, I would stop eating it. Why put myself through this for something I don't need?

I quit smoking a little over a month ago

Today is my 6th day without a drink, and then the next day. I have a lot of thinking to do. I'm 2/3 of the way through the Carr book.

I told my partner last night that I am strongly considering not drinking anymore. She is supportive. I'm not going to make a big deal out of it or tell the whole world. My very valid excuse not to drink in social settings is that I'm on medication that interacts with alcohol. So...here I go.

I'm a 22 year old male and I am, or was, a certified binge drinker. Every weekend, special events, or sometimes random days in the week, I would start drinking. When I started, it was impossible for me to stop until all the booze was gone or I was passed out. I've been doing this probably since I was 18 with no negative repercussions, things started changing...

I have an anxiety disorder and alcohol can completely mask my anxieties. All my worrying, my anxiety started to become worse the morning after a heavy session. It started off small, I would feel just a little panic'd, but gradually it has become horrific. The next day becomes a write off, I can't move, my heart beats super fast, my blood pressure sky rockets. I literally feel like I could have a stroke or heart attack at any moment. I've gone to the hospital because of this COUNTLESS times. I'm tired of feeling this way

Well no more. I'm done, I don't know how I'll explain to my friends that I don't want to drink. I don't know how I'll meet new people, let alone girls (which is hard to do to begin with.)

1367765613.0,1dqe8y,How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love My Fellow Humans,Ambivalent_Fanatic,35,4,24,"**TLDR:  While it is possible for some people to get sober alone

IN the years before I got sober

I was sure they were completely wrong.  They obviously didn't understand me

Also, i.e. the bum who had been rescued from the street, or the addict who had been pulled back from the brink of death.  I have a university-level education and a long list of professional accomplishments in my field.  I had no business in the same room with that scum.  

So

I did eventually stop drinking, in fact, I was sober without AA, and I was making decent progress.  That is, I wasn't just ""dry"", but I was actually doing honest work on myself.  I was not a total noob at spiritual development.  I had done a lot of reading, a lot of meditating, and some genuinely humble self-exploration.  In my quest to heal my wounded soul and arrive at the peace I knew must exist somewhere in the world

(Except quitting drinking

At the two-year mark

So, but I didn't love it.  I still felt the same resistance to all the bullshit about God and a Higher Power (I mean, really?  come on, this is the fucking 21st century, and you expect me to believe in some omnipotent deity who will just zap away my problems if I get down on my knees and ask him?)  But it wasn't nearly as prevalent as I remembered.  And if I reminded myself to live and let live, I found it didn't bother me at all.  No one was actually trying to force me to believe anything, after all.  They were simply sharing what they believed.  And if I had a problem with that, open-minded fellow I made myself out to be.

Anyway, and I don't say it.  But this stuff takes up about 1% of meetings.  The rest of the time is when the important stuff happens-—the talking, the sharing, and the helping.  These are why I go to meetings now, and why I feel energized and stronger every time I come out of one.  I now feel as if I am finally making the spiritual progress I used to strive for throughout my teens, twenties, and thirties.  And it's not nearly as hard as I made it out to be.  All I had to do was open up.

Think about it this way.  It is entirely possible for someone to get sober and stay sober all by themselves.  But why?  What is the point of being that super-smart guy who has the smug satisfaction of knowing he did it alone?  How did he grow?  What did he prove?  Who does he have to share it with?  Where is the laughter in all that?  Who does he share it with--his stereo system?  His carpet?  His furniture?

So, just remember: there's a lot more to it than the higher power stuff.  (And I do have a higher power kind of thing going on these days, but since it's highly personal, I won't get into it.)  In general, the more open I am in my willingness to get sober and stay that way, with AA or any other program of growth, the less likely I am to relapse and the easier things will get for me.

And life lately has been wonderful.  Absolutely wonderful.

This has been my experience.  I thought I would share in the hope that it resonates with some of you.  If you don't want to try AA

So in addition to exercising, I also wanted to eliminate fast food/bar food from my diet. Pop was only going to be acceptable when I went out as a substitution for alcohol.

I stopped cold turkey (do NOT do this), the symptoms were enough to make me visit the urgent care clinic. They sent me to the emergency room. I got there, they stabilized me and sent me home with some lorazepam to counter the withdrawal. I can tell you that the emergency room was the last place I expected to go. I didn't realize I was that dependent. It sounds cliche, but it scared me straight.

The next few months were hard. My body was trying to stabilize itself without the alcohol, and general uneasiness. I began taking lots of vitamins and eating healthier to help replenish what alcohol robbed from me.

I went on vacation with a group of friends who drink

I was pretty worried that going on vacation would be my breaking point, does it feel good.

It was really hard the first two days. My brain was hardwired to think, lets get drunk! But I resisted the urges. I reminded myself that I would actually be able to remember everything that happened, not make any rash decisions, and be kind of the responsible one that helped everyone get around. The only other time I was tested was when I went to a restaurant that had my favorite beer (that I couldn't find ANYWHERE where I live). Even my friends who said they wouldn't drink were drinking, so it was really hard. I removed myself from the restaurant a few times to just stand outside and get my head in the right space, and made it through the night. 

The rest of the time was easy, no worrying if I pissed anyone off. More sightseeing, more band watching, more memories.

I'm really proud of myself. My husband is really proud of me. My friends didn't pressure me to drink once and supported me when I told them I was having a bit of trouble. When I came back from vacation my friends at home were really impressed that I didn't drink. Some of them didn't think I could do it. But I did.

Sorry if this is a bit of a gloating post, and I'm no longer counting the days until I feel like I can let myself drink again - I'm just enjoying being alcohol-free, paying way more attention to things in life I would have otherwise just let pass by me because my head wasn't really screwed on right due to alcohol. 

Thanks for the support on this forum - checking back in here while on vacation and reading posts by people of encouragement and self stories really helped to remind me why I am doing this and the personal rewards involved.

This isn't my first time quitting, maybe it'll be slow, but I'm certainly not going up from here with the way I was acting. So tonight, I took the advice of this subreddit and I made the choice to attend an AA meeting. I thought the best one to go for the first time would be a young persons' AA and I feel I made a good choice. I'm 24, so before today I'd say I'm in the smaller age group of alcoholics, but after tonight I feel a bit differently.

I was nervous going alone to a place I hadn't been before (something that always makes me nervous/socially awkward.. but especially for this type of thing). I walked up to the church  in the middle of the city and didn't know where to enter and began thinking I might not be able to find the room. Then I saw a ton of younger people smoking outside, young people (and some older people) in this meeting! I couldn't believe it. There were barely enough seats to house everyone. They began with one girls story, who had been through a lot and had been sober 7 years and was now back in Philadelphia and still fighting the good fight. I wanted to break down and cry hearing her story. I didn't feel that way because of the emotion of the story, but because of the feelings we shared throughout this journey and what I saw of myself in her. Feelings I haven't faced before. Feelings I couldn't put into words before, but there they were falling out of her mouth so eloquently and nonchalant and it really felt like an epiphany. It scared me to feel these emotions, knowing its just a crack in the floodgates and the real hard things are to come, but man it was ... amazing.

They then went on to give out chips. 1 month, 1 year, more than a year. Everyone clapped as people went up. A huge, loud round of applause. I'm normally shy and don't want to be in front of everyone, but when they asked ""24 hours or still counting days?"" I had to get up. I needed to know what it felt like to be proud of myself for that time, but to feel the support of this group, even if I am still just a stranger to them. It felt really

People then went around and shared their thoughts about the main speakers story. They talked about their own situations and what resonated with them. One person had just gone on a bender the night before and seemed to be making it in maybe just in time to save his life and his career. Another was about to restart his career tomorrow if he could prove he was sober.

At the end everyone stood in a circle (or what could be made of one, but at that moment I just felt so... raw. As I've mentioned. And not in any negative way. I'm feeling happy. I'm feeling hopeful. I'm feeling scared for whats to come but knowing I need to get through the fire to get to the other side... this magical place that people in the room were talking about. Where they were relieved of their worries, their past transgressions. A place where they are completely happy with themselves and feel whole. It didnt sound somewhere where you wouldnt still find temptation, but it sounded like somewhere where the temptation just couldnt hold a flame to the happiness and wholeness they feel now. Tonight I've begun the journey, and I can't wait to get there.

I tried, and could not stop drinking.  The shame made me change accounts and I would try again and again only to repeatedly fail.

I am a 37 year old, and live in the western burbs of Chicago.  I started drugs and alcohol when I was 15.  Loved it.  Father is an alcoholic and I did not want that to become that so I mainly used drugs.  Followed the Grateful Dead.  Had no direction in life.  Just wanted to party.

Fast Forward.  Had my first kid when I was 24.  Quit drugs except for pot shortly there after.  I did not want to get arrested again.  Didn't want to be a dad in jail.  Marijuana use cut way back.  Cue alcohol.  Alcohol is legal and as long as I didn't drive I couldn't get into trouble. So I started drinking every night.

Fast forward. I had second child when I was 29. Still drinking every night.  Didn't think it was a problem.  Still no idea of having an actual career or anything.  Just work

Fast forward. A couple years ago I realized I had a problem and could not stop.  Found subreddit. Got badge. And it wasn't enough to get me to stop.

Fast forward. 5 months ago.  I could not stop drinking.  Every night.  Depression.  Anxiety.  I thought I was a loser.  I thought I was a weak.  I thought I was a mental defect.  Contemplated suicide.

And I decided to go to an AA meeting.

The first meeting I went to I could not get out of the car.  Too much fear and anxiety.  I went home.  Later that night (about 6 o'clock) a lady came up to me and asked me to do a shot of vodka with her. Honestly, and they say there is a solution.  I went home and did not drink.

I kept going to meetings.  I kept not drinking.  

Then I started to feel shitty.  I knew that I had to do something that I did not want to

I still go to meetings everyday.  I chair meetings.  I talk with any newcomer I can. And I still don't drink.  Hell

Sometimes AA pisses me off.  Sometimes AA confuses me (atheist). But I just keep going.  And I keep not drinking.

We had to change to a longer lasting medication(s) as with my body no longer fighting the alcohol I no longer needed to take the other stuff.

He then asked me: ""Will you ever drink again?""

And my answer, I couldn't believe JUST HOW much I meant it: ""Drink alcohol? Fucking never again.""

When I said it

The conversation continued, and you don't need it as a distraction, I guess you'll be getting new friends, eh?""

This point I had thought of

I thought about it and answered thusly: ""I don't think I'm *getting* new friends at all. I just think that my priorities are changing

He was perplexed

""You guys went to the bar last night, you invited me anyway to 'have a club soda'. I appreciate the social invite, but the simple fact is: Really, going to a bar does nothing *for* me at all anymore.

When it comes down to it, I'll still be your friend, but we won't be spending much time together if all you want to do is get drunk.""

I left it at that. 

The cool thing is (and this of course depends on your friendship and the habits of your friend) that he instantly tried to qualify himself as ""a great friend to go to the gym with"", write comedy. . to do all of the things I find fun in lieu of drinking.


I think it's awesome, and something almost to brag about.

The fact that he's very keen (almost trying to insure) that we stay friends, so **of course** he's going to make an effort.*

tl:dr: Be clear with your drinking friends about what you're doing. You may be surprised at how willing they are to make changes in themselves to accomodate your new sobriety.

The longest I've been since Christmas.",ColGoDuckYourself,31,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ztyi3/so_3_days_sober_the_longest_ive_been_since/, and most Sundays. I took a break for about a year and a half after graduating high school. I moved away from the people I drank with and it was a hassle to get someone to buy me booze. Then around 19/20 things got kicked into high gear. I started drinking everyday although drinking a whole bottle of liquor was an exceptionally heavy night. Not unheard of

Then around 22 things got kicked into higher gear. A bottle a night was a heavier night but not unusual. A year later and a bottle a night had become the norm. Since then I've fluctuated between 4/5 of a bottle and 1 1/5. For example

Then it got to a handle every 2 days. With the exception of the recently mentioned several months that's been around the norm for the past ~2 years. There were a few separate days where I didn't drink anything because I was dating someone who didn't like me to drink around them. And, until this past month I've been a ""high-functioning"" alcoholic. Well, except for one time where I got kicked out of college - but that was due to depression and the booze was just an accessory.

Since then I've had a GPA of something like 3.4 and I haven't drank and drove since I was ~20 and much stupider than I am now. But the past month has shown me just how much alcohol has taken away from me. I've been going on benders and missing classes, B -&gt; C, etc) reduction. And in the ones that don't have mandatory attendance? When you only attend 1 out of the first 5 classes then you're sure to effectively have a serious enough grade reduction.

But it isn't just that. I've slowly come to realize that I effectively have no identiy, and hell I don't even have bad social skills per se. When I talk to people for awhile - when it isn't months between conversations - I remind myself of someone who has taken the advice of Brad Pitt from Ocean's 11:

&gt; Don't use seven words when four will do. Don't shift your weight, be funny but don't make him laugh. He's got to like you then forget you the moment you've left his side.

I forget where I was going with that, I've neglected writing, I've neglected maintaining a decent apartment, I've neglected just about everything.

Other than the class thing there were two other major recent events that have made me decide to stop drinking:

1. Eyes/Vision
2. A scrape on my arms.

My vision has gotten horrible over the past year or so. I haven't been able to drive at night for most of 2012. I'm reasonably certain the reason is that along with obesity, but your liver whatnots are high, did you go out and drink last night?"" Well, of course I had but we all know that wasn't the only reason they were high. So he asked me to come back after not drinking for a week. The longest I've gone without drinking has been 2 days except for today (the third day sober). Well, I just sucked it up and accepted I wouldn't drive after dark.

I was willing to give up functioning at night if that meant I got to keep drinking. Then over the past month or so my vision has deteriorated even more. Specifically

The other day, responsible people don't do that, normal people don't do that. It's an outward manifestation of the harm I've been doing to myself.

Anyway

I've felt like complete shit all Tuesday and Wednesday, nor have I smoked a cigarette. These aren't intentional things I just haven't had the motivation to eat or go buy cigarettes. I was going to do that today until I nearly vomited water up (again, just like yesterday). I suppose I still might because the day is young as they say.

At any rate

I mention this as with the exception of Halloween and Christmas its been relatively easy...today...as Adam Sandler said in his first comedy CD, ""Fuck me in the goat ass.""

I truly have no desire to drink and I do not fear a lapse nor relapse whatsoever. I don't have an issue with being around alcohol 98% of the time at the bar, since 17, I am sober or not drinking today and what fucking sucks is I am missing everything.

My brother lives on the largest lake in the TC and is having a pool/lake party today. I passed. This time last year I was there having a blast with family,** last truly happy event/time we had is overwhelming. Seeing hundreds of hundreds of people out on the lake, having fun, the vast vast majority of whom are drinking, happy (yes, I know that's an assumption and subjective) so I feel/felt, well I know

There was no pressure

I try hard to not regret my past actions/decisions are they are what made me who I am, took ownership over the situation and am doing my very best to not repeat not repeat (yes, twice purposely) my mistakes in my previous life and make the wrongs right or liveable. But today, today is fucking overwhelming and just disgustingly **FUCKING MISERABLE!!!!** It just flat out fucking sucks. I'm sorry for the cursing but I have a potty mouth as is but its just what's going through my head.

So here I am, the regret reel on repeat, missing the LOML, regretting the pain and suffering I caused to those around me and I am very very disappointed in myself (I do know that I should not feel this way but I'm just in this state of mind) that I am letting an arbitrary date impact me like this as I have not really experienced this thus far.

Edit: Thanks for the support

The first feeling I recall having is fear.  I was painfully shy, haha). I could not interact with people at all.  People are scary.  I could maybe say ""hello, how are you"" but did not feel I had anything to offer after that.  I became afraid of committing to any sort of conversation.  This discomfort and fear were always present and did not subside until I had my first drink.  It was definitely that sigh of relief for me.  Immediately, I drank alcoholically.  I don't mean that I drank everyday or in the morning....but my first drink was by myself in the closet in my room.  I drank cold medicine for the effect.  I stole pain medication from my grandparents.  Once I realized I could feel differently I did everything I could do make it happen.  Luckily for me, the fear kept me from going to crazy.  I couldn't get in trouble....(I did a few times...nothing too big)...my parents will hate me!  

I had a best friend in high school. Finally.  She completed me.  She was loud and uninhibited and I could cling to that.  I would go to parties and drinking was the only way I could feel comfortable.  I remember clearly a conversation with her that mostly consisted of her desperately trying to understand why I couldn't talk to anyone.  In high school I drank and drugged when I could...which wasn't as often as I liked...plus the fear kept me under control.  There were times when I drank before/during school...bought cocaine from a dealer friend and did that before school for a while in total secrecy.  Went to college and was a black out drinker.  Drank often and never controlled myself.  Woke up in random dude's beds.  Gave up drugs because once I turned 21 it was so much easier just to drink.  Got one obligatory DUI.  I did not have many consequences aside from general self loathing and hatred.  

I am a musician and decided to move to a city to study for grad school.  Part of my identity was that ""I am a tortured artist....I am just going to be depressed and sick from drinking""....as long as I could perform I felt like life was ok...screw the fact that I was no longer enjoying music in any form.  Two years of grad school....four years of post grad....all the while hating myself and performing because I was supposed to...not even really knowing that I didn't enjoy it anymore.  I didn't do as much black out drinking here because I was trying to be respectable.  But I could not spend time at home by myself without drinking.  I became a daily drunk...if I could just get through my practicing for the day then I could get my reward.  For me...the hangover was just as important.  Being sick meant at least I felt differently that usual.  My world became smaller and smaller...get up too late and hungover...get through the minimum amount of work/practice....maaaaybe ask one of my few friends to get a drink...walk around until I was too tired to move and maaaybe I wouldn't need to drink as much....drink.  That was it. 

The obsession was overwhelming

I had a friend in AA.  He was a crazy, I found hope and people that cared....people that felt just like I did.  I didn't understand most of AA or what the steps were or what these silly slogans meant.....but I just kept going and eventually things started to sink in.  I got a sponsor who is now one of my greatest friends.  The first thing she told me that changed my life was ""It's ok.  It's normal to feel the way you do."" WHAT.  And....""Your feelings will change."" I was so overcome by the fact that I was abnormal and nothing would ever change that that truly blew my mind.  I think all I needed for the first few months was for her to repeat that over and over.  

The past year has been hard...I've had to feel my emotions...I've had to learn to talk to people....I've had to learn to be uncomfortable and fearful and move through those emotions.  I have had to learn (I am still learning) to be grateful.  I do not want to be grateful or humble....but I owe AA and the people of AA my life and the contentment I feel (on most days).  Happy 24! 

Thank you for reading....it really helped me a lot to type this up because I am sharing at my home group meeting this afternoon and I am SUPER nervous and fearful.  But I know they love me. :-)

1368045320.0,1dydk1,This is the first time I'd admitting what I am. Sorry for the length.,Winogirl,30,1,27,"This is certainly not something I ever expected to be doing

After my first year of college, my drinking went from seldom and moderate to party style bingey. All of my coworkers drank heavily, and often, and so did I. It was a lot of fun at the time. I was hanging out with new friends, older people, and different faces. It was a new chapter in my life, and a lot of the people I met during this phase of my life are still my best friends today. **I don’t regret those years at all**, but drinking wasn’t all we did. The conversations

I can still remember the first time I bought a bottle of wine for myself. It felt so special and grown up to be drinking a bottle of wine with sushi

2 years ago I moved into a house with some friends. We lived by the beach and spent the first year drinking a lot, and we would stay up all night talking over a bottle of Jack. He would drive drunk to my house, where I was also drunk, and we would stare at each other, have sex, laugh. Friends would comment on how awesome it must feel to be in a relationship where you can just sit around drinking and laughing; as if every day is a good day. We were irresponsible – absolutely-, but we were also all capable of stopping. We didn’t think about drinking, we didn’t feel like there was some secret hidden problem. It didn’t interfere with anything. We weren’t “functioning alcoholics”. We just drank a lot on the weekends.

But in the last year, their health, and their futures. They just grew out of that phase. Everyone that is, except for me. I didn’t slow down, and in the last 6 months my drinking has escalated so completely that it terrified me. I would notice the amount of alcohol in other people’s cups, and would count my drinks against theirs, “I’m on my third glass

I drink by myself and get wasted at least 3/5 days during the workweek. I then drink to excess on Friday and/or Saturday. I wake up more days than not with regret, so I hide in my room. Worst of all though, is the feeling of total lack of control. This isn’t a choice for me anymore.
 
I’ve been rationalizing this away for a while. The term “alcoholic” was like a death sentence to me

 Last month, but because I kept it secret, he didn’t understand the severity and told me that if I wanted to stop, to just stop. I didn’t want to tell him how severe it was either, because I was so ashamed. So I instead took his suggestion and nothing changed.

Yesterday I woke up feeling all of the usual horrors associated with the morning after. It was Tuesday, my skin was greasy, my mouth was disgusting, and I just had enough. I finally decided I was an alcoholic. 

And suddenly! I feel so free. Just admitting that I couldn’t control my drinking took a huge weight from me. As in, I have been craving  peace, tranquility and stillness, and I finally realize that in order to make room for those things, I need to remove this demon.

I ordered Allen Carr’s book and hope it arrives before my brain starts convincing me I’m really “okay”. Already today, even though I’ve known what I am for a while.

The truth is, my roommates, my boyfriend – they all stopped drinking for the most part, and I think I will eventually lose everything if I don’t stop. My boyfriend will eventually have to leave me if I continue. I think I will eventually lose my job. I know it will tear away at my relationship with my sister, whom I’m about to move in with. And, my decision to continue drinking will steal from me any chance at achieving the life I deserve for myself.

I know this won’t be easy and I am a little nervous

Ten days later, but it was in my mind early on that as soon as I was able, that's what I would do. It's all a blur, but perhaps a doctor recommended it. Somewhere I my haze, I figured that was the correct next thing to do.



AA didn't make any sense for probably the first two months. In that time, at first just as a bunch of tips you could use to keep yourself from getting pissed off, then eventually as a way of maybe seeing some of my problems from the other person's point of view. This was months of work for me, just getting to the point of knowing the difference between facts and feelings, or figuring out that every one of my emotions didn't require a reaction.

Proceed to smash my drivers side window, drive 22 miles to my house. In the process of this, however, I hit a low spot, and smacked the whole bottom side of my car on the pavement. Decide I need to stop somewhere and check it out. For whatever fucked up reason, I was right by my sisters, and stopped in there. She was still up, who is a sheriff. Now

Lets take a small trip back in time. When I turned 16, and she bought copious amounts of alcohol for us. Thus, began the ordeal. I never really drank much until I moved a couple states away, and wound up in a little tourist trap with 190 drinking establishments in a town of 1500.

Still didn't drink all that much until I started bartending. Whooooweee. I had so much fun at that job. I married another bartender. She was wonderful. She had two kids, you were drinking this whole time!?!? How the fuck did I not notice this!?!?!? We got through it, tried again, but I had started drinking heavily.. Another failure at 8 months, but not do to alcohol.

 The entire duration of our relationship, line cook, worked my way up, became a chef (by title, it haunts me to this day), and further onto kitchen manager, at 25, daily. Her kids called me Dad. They still do, with a post it note that says 'Goodbye.'

That.. that's it? A week later I got the divorce papers. At work. Broke down in my office. Same day, for multiple myeloma. Completely lost it at work, I was a babbling wreck when my sous chef came in for dinner service, curled up in the corner of the office with a bottle of Crown. She said nothing to my superiors, just used my login info on the computer to clock me out, and alter it so that I 'didn't come in for family reasons.'

I went to a bar, bloody mary at 9am with the owner, called in, and drank all day. Drove 12 miles back to my house. Got a call from my new ex, and we had mediation that day, which is one I'll never forget. One of my good guy friends, someone that called me bro for 8 years, and I soon found out that he'd been sleeping with her on and off for over a year. Great.

I let her have everything except my truck. I turned around, to try and take care of my mother. Drank the entire way here. Got shit faced nightly with my step dad while I ran through my savings binge drinking, paying there rent, and sleeping on there couch.

 I've been here 6 months now, and a busted up chin? What happened to the suits? I own blue jeans? Where's my truck? Did I really trade it in on some piece of shit beater, just so I had more money to drink, before I finally found the only good thing in my life, my current job? Have I really been poisoning that well too, like my fuzzy memory is telling me I have?

When I came here, I decided I would sit down last night, and go out the way I came in - With a 40 oz of Old english, like that night when I was 16. Before I even cracked it, I sat there thinking back on the night I drank the first time. All the good, supportive friends I had going the high school. My phone buzzes at me. Txt? From who?

""Did you ever live in Carrollton before?"" From a number I've never seen in my life.

My response : ""Yes

My phone starts ringing.

""Hello?""
""Name the girl, you stole a dozen roses off that assholes car, gave to her, and we spent the whole day at your house skipping school.""

Mother. Of. God. ""Amber."" Cue that last

It was my best friend from high school. The guy that gave me more courage and had my back 1000 ways from sunday, a wife, all of it. I would have expected him to be a total junkie. Talk about opposite. Turns out I'm basically a junkie that might as well be freeloading on my mothers couch at this point, with no prospects in bettering myself. He's a 5 year, 2 time combat vet, Army man, has two kids with his highschool sweetheart (another amazing friend)

I drank that beer, shivering, shaking uncontrollably. Every glass of water I drink, I sweat out almost instantly. I don't ever want to drink again, but I'm sure after work tonight, I'll be staring longingly at the taps behind the bar as I clock out, and I just hope I don't slip up.

I have been debating on where to post this to, are genuinely wanted and appreciated.

Getting sober means finding new ways to accept and deal with life, instead of drinking in response to the things that happen to us.

I'm not sure if it's the fact I've gotten used to experiencing stress without drunkenness after, I guess I'd compare it to being 16 and working full time but not having access to booze (I was a loner). It just wasn't an option then, and it's not now. I sort of think of alcohol as a food item I'm allergic to rather than a drug I have a problem with.

I'm attempting to finish a degree that might be physically impossible to complete in the time I have, despite extensions, making my chosen field of work a (probable) impossibility. I have a CV that shows me as over educated and under experienced. I'm seeing the cracks in my family (riddled with alcoholism and enablers), and the possibility of having to become a carer for at least two members in the near future. Every mental health issue I have shoved down into the Pit of Subconscious with the Stick of Alcoholism is bubbling unimpeded to the surface. Most of my friends have moved away to do sickeningly normal things, like pursue careers and have babies. Some cocktail of hormones has conspired against me to make me break out in grey hairs and spots *at the same time*. I think my nose has put on weight. This morning I stood on an plug. 

















If I was still drinking, and then, by 5.30, just have one drink to 'take the edge off'. Now I'm not drinking, I am able to look at them in the eye.  I recognise that my upbringing and past and even genetics have magnified the potentiality for substance abuse to horrible proportions. But I also recognise my own agency. I take responsibility for my failures and my faults. When I was drinking (this is hard to admit) I would play with fantasies of success, of being loved, of being a functional and admirable human being (probably engaged in while I was lying face down drooling and surrounded by bottles). It was easy to do with my mind in a black fog. Sobriety, has forced me into humility and clarity. The curtain over the Dorian Grey portrait of my soul has been yanked off. It ain't pretty














For every problem I have there is a solution. It might take a long time and a lot of effort, but I have come to terms with my failures. My current situation, in terms of prospects and money, is the 'worst' of my life, but I feel quite cheerful. I am working to change it. I'm growing into a proper human being. I'm applying for any job I can and happy that I at least have the resources - a computer, internet - to do so. I am grateful to be sober and for all the support and all the people here. I know if I was drinking everything would be worse and this is the only way it can get better.

I can't believe how far I let alcohol and depression bring me down. I mean

I was sitting in bed in the dark with a beer in my hand at 8am the other day when I started thinking about all my problems and struggles.

This quitting drinking business is, my friends and I continued to do this; we liked it. We liked the sneaking around, we liked getting away with something, and we liked being drunk. As far as we were concerned there was nothing wrong with any of this, since we thought we had everything under control. We weren't going to jail, we were keeping up with school. 

By the time I got to college, and, again, I thought I was basically OK. I later found out that I had a reputation as a keg-sucking fool, which is probably because that is what I was. By the last year or so, however, I was partying much less

In my 20's I was doing a lot better. I was playing in a band, he had quit drinking, and we were all sober at practices and shows to support him. If I was ever a normal drinker, it was in this period. But I would still throw pretty excessive binges from time to time. 

As 30 heaved into view, although  got pretty close. My spotty academic record was just too much of an obstacle, perhaps. By this time I had moved to a different city with the same girlfriend and broken up with her. I was 30, with more or less no practical job skills and  with no idea what to do. Some more personal stuff happened that didn't go the way I had hoped. I fell into another period of crisis.

I decided that academia wasn't going to work out and started thinking about getting into computers. This was a lucky break: by now, you just needed to show up. This chariot swung low and rescued many people in my situation - liberal arts grads who couldn't do anything else except work in restaurants, retail, or as office temps. 

But this is also when the real bad drinking resumed. There were a few dramatic incidents, but I was just lost as a human being. Depressed, self-pitying, brooding about the past and about my missed opportunities in life. I gradually started drinking more hard liquor then beer. Beer now was just inconvenient; I had to drink aboout 12 of them to get as much alcohol as I wanted. I didn't like feeling bloated and pissing every 15 minutes. Whiskey is a much more efficient drug delivery system  By about 2004, I'd often head straight to the liquor store for a pint right after work. I started calling in sick with hangovers. I knew what I was doing to myself but I eother didn't care or didn't want to stop. I'd tell myself I'd stop, but not yet. The pints became fifths. I noticed that it had been a long time since I had even vomited from drinking excessive liquor; my system was used to it. 

Sometimes I'd drink in a way that you might call normal drinking. I'd have a glass of wine, I remember thinking: I could just go on like this, I don't have to start again. But I wanted to drink, and I did. I guess I was playing the familiar game of ""proving"" to myself that I wasn't an alcoholic. At first I was more in control. I'd drink only on the weekends, and I'd drink less. A year later, I was worse than I had been before the month off, which is a dead giveaway, in a day or two

No dramatic consequences ever happened. No arrests, ongoing misery, solitary drinking. There was no rock bottom, it was just a gradual slide into despair. Drinking with other people was just an annoyance by now; they'd be sloppy drunk and a problem, while I was still getting started. I went on like this for at least three years. 

The thought started to occur to me more often that my bullshit about how I wasn't an alcoholic, pull out of this, wasn't coming to pass. I was getting old, in my early 40s by then, and I wasn't getting better. I was getting worse. The 3 or 4 days between huge drinking sessions was becoming 2 or 3 days. Sometimes 1 day. I started ""quitting"" drinking. I'd go for a week or so, and then decide that I could drink again, then, I'd REALLY quit. 

To this day I'm not sure how I snapped out of that. I guess you could say it was a moment of clarity. It occured to me that it was possible that I actually couldn't stop. When you are still youthful, the reality hits you: this IS my real life. I was on track to become a sick, broken-down drunk. Or maybe a suicide. 

I'll tell you another thing that truly scared the shit out of me. I got drunk one night and passed out. Woke up the next morning, and fell off the bike. He fell away from the road. If he had fallen the other way, there is absolutely no way I could have avoided hitting him. I don't know if I was still legally drunk, but I probably was, and even if I was a little under, I would have gone down as the drunk driver who killed him. Never mind that the Pope couldn't have avoided the accident - he'd be dead and I'd be in prison right now. Or maybe I'm kidding myself, and that accident, but could have

So I decided, I'll check into rehab or something, I'll do whatever I have to do. I drank a fifth of Jameson on Nov 11, 2011. I didn't even enjoy it. Alcohol had become about need, not pleasure. After a few days, when I normally would have done the same thing again, I  just didn't. I started reading and posting here. I learned to focus on a goal of not drinking for one single day.  After a few months, I think because I used to jump on new posters and encourage them. It's a year later and I have not had a single drink. The thought that maybe I can one day drink normally has crossed my mind

My life has improved so much in every way. I feel better, but it seems to me that I now have a chance to actually make progress. When I become depressed, I can bounce out of it. I value what I still have and what I can still do in life, instead of wallowing in regret and self-pity and in thinking about the chances that I missed due to my own folly. Why didn't I do this years ago? I guess the answer is pretty obvious - because I'm an alcoholic and I still wanted to drink.

We blacked out, found it hilarious despite the crippling hangovers.  We sought to recreate this experience in every chance given.
 
 
Without surprise, for young people. During my interview, they asked me questions about my drug use and drinking.  I didn't think much of it.  I was young and fighting for my right to party.  It's what we did.  It's what everyone did, right?
 
 
Due to my honesty in the interview, but it didn't stick.  *I didn't have a problem.*
 
 
Flash forward past the insanity of my school years to my early twenties.  I'm 23 and getting married to a woman I proposed to, she tells me she has informed her parents of the good news.  ""Good news?  We're getting married?""  
 
 
Ahh, so I did and so we did.  We both got blackout drunk at our own wedding.  Hardly anyone else drank anything.  The marriage lasted, surprisingly, 7 years and I feel the reason it lasted so long was because we drank at every chance.
 
 
There was abuse -- on both sides.  Physical from her and mental from me.  The divorce was ugly
 
 
That meeting didn't stick.  I heard what they were saying, I felt I was at least managing.  I was still driving this train.
 
 
A few drunken years later, and opiates when I could get them.  I drove her away in proper fashion with a drunken attempt to fuck her sister.  A right, true gentleman!
 
 
I decided I would only date drinkers from here on out and wouldn't get married again.  Brilliant!  That's when blackouts became my regular thing.  I would visit my haunts and complete strangers would greet me either with open arms or verbal threats, singing songs of debauchery and buggery on the high seas.
 
 
My drinking escalated and a corporate lawsuit came along at work.  I was involved, unscathed -- at least in a legal and civic sense.  The Percosets ran out and I didn't really care.  I had my other ""medicine"", as I called it.  Again, the drinking escalated. 
 
 
I tried to leash it, ""I'm going to quit tomorrow.""
 
 
I finally managed to stay sober for all of a month.  Now
 
 
I met a very nice woman.  She didn't drink and didn't have an addiction.  She was just what I needed to cure myself.  In fact
 
 
I had a drink on our second date.  By the time the date was over
 
  
Months passed, I tried to stop drinking again.  ""Babe, I promise.  I will stop.""  *I never lasted more than a few weeks.*
 
 
Last week, it had escalated.  My girlfriend came home and was wondering why I was acting fucked up.  I lied and told her I only had three beers.  I did have three beers -- three beers and three bottles of wine!  I was planning on drinking another three beers and have at least half of the bottle of Riesling that I had bought for her.
 
 
The inevitable fight started.  I remember some of it.  I was out of control and about to lose a very good woman
 
 
I was sorry
 
 
The next day, but a voice in my head told me to get my ass to the meeting at 12PM.  I went and was so scared, you could have seen my heart beating through my skin.  I left halfway through it.  Later that evening, I went to another meeting and stood up to get my 24 hour chip.
 
 
Since then, but I'm going on 8 days without a drink thanks to the fellowship and unity of the meetings.  I'm an agnostic and not one to believe in fairy tales, but there's something going on at these meetings.  I don't understand it, but I want what they have.

I sashayed into the shop like a viking (or something) because I was still feeling chuffed with myself after last night. What's the first thing that greeted me as I walk in?


Oh


Of *course*


Ugh.


I am resolved to walk right past it


""Shit. The wine is talking to me.""


It wasn't, because she knew that I'd just walked past my favourite brand of red wine on half price and was looking at me like I'd gone a bit mad and that she was doing me a huge favour by gesturing at the Special Offer stand. I had a two minute, excrutiating conversation with her where I couldn't think up an excuse fast enough and let her put a bottle of wine in my basket. Little Bastard Wine Imp shrieked with joy, of course. After my friend left, I looked at the wine in my basket and thought that it would be all right if I bought it, because TECHNICALLY I didn't pick it up off the shelf myself.


I mean, and I sort of stood there like an idiot for five minutes battling with myself. The OTHER thing is that (sorry about this TMI, gents) it is the beginning of *that time of the month*, it started this afternoon. I can never predict it because I've messed my body up so much with alcohol that it doesn't come regularly, and sometimes it doesn't come at all, but when it finally does it is excrutiating and awful. It's like torture. I usually drink more when it's my period because I think that I deserve to, what with all the pain and hormones, I have this wine in my basket that is my favourite


Come on. I practically HAD to buy it


I walked about six paces away with the wine


I bought about a million ice pops and Jubblies instead.

This isn't my story or anything.  I will only say that I've drank too much for the past decade and struggled to curb it for quite a while.

It was time to quit (again -- previous attempts always ended up being rationalized into ""breaks"" rather than quitting

I did something I hadn't done before.  I took the last beer in my fridge.  I looked at my girlfriend.  And I said

So I poured it out.  She high fived me.  I felt empowered by this -- the pouring it out and also having a supporting witness.  All the other times I ever quit drinking, and I think it has helped me stay alcohol-free (I think I'm at week 4 or 5, not sure) and have no urge to drink anymore.

I had a great experience. I went to a meeting for young people-- everyone there was in their 20s which was fantastic for me. And because it was on a Saturday night

As a skeptic of AA, but I was proven dead wrong tonight. ""Try everything once"" was my motto when I was drinking and doing drugs, but I think it applies to getting sober too :)

Well

I wanted to get some sobriety under my belt before posting here.  I'm damn proud to be 3 months in.  This is further into sobriety than I had ever dreamed I could get.  I've been lurking for too long

Now none of them are alcoholics. but they do drink. I went to a friends going away party this weekend and took off my shoes and had a seat in the corner (I am rather anti-social) and then it hit me. I could smell the beer and wine. I looked over to the table and it was COVERED with boxes and bottles of wine. I KNEW the fridge was stocked with beer. Everyone had one in there hands and EVERYONE that talked to me smelled like alcohol. I stay neatly planted for one hour aside from asking someone for a can of coke

Thanks for reading for all those that did.

I lasted 37 days. 

I used a positive excuse to attempt moderation, my hairstylist at the time who I was insanely attracted to asking me out while I was in her chair, and then later blowing me off which left me believing that I'd screwed up and wasn't good enough. It was so bad that the next (and last) two times I saw her, I wanted to be drunk going to see her so I could act aloof and that it didn't bother me.

Here I am two years later with a new resolve and a new record.

This time there will be no excuses
