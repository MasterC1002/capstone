1366919148.0,1d3qqc,My correspondence with Suburban Express's Lawyer,NegatedVoid,960,146,392,"
**Update: [no lawsuit](http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/1d6g7i/suburban_expresss_lawyer_no_lawsuit/)**


Got this letter in the mail today. Sorry for the crappy cell phone picture

[Here is a link to the letter i received](http://imgur.com/a/OYasT).

Dear Mr. Long

First
have it wrong.

Below
that I'm quickly retyping your words as I go
or typographical errors are a mistake. Please supply me with a proper
electronic copy of further correspondence.

&gt; It is my client's understanding that you are the moderator of this
  thread

I am one of several moderators
ability to interact with the postings on /r/uiuc.

&gt; and not only are you personally publishing false and libelous
  information

I don't believe I am
specifics on this accusation. I don't intend to be libelous.

&gt; but you are also allowing false and libelous posting about my
  client's business operations despite clear knowledge on your part
  that the materials are untruthful.

I have no 'clear knowledge' that anything posted is libelous
far as i know
postings. If you wish to have those postings modified
your letters to Reddit
people to post their opinions and try to only remove content if it is
violating the community guidelines.

&gt; It is my understanding that you have no personal experience to form
  as a basis to make the assertions that you have published
  you have never been a customer of Suburban Express with a negative
  experience.

This is false. I've had personal negative experiences with Suburban
Expresss

&gt; It is my understanding that whenever anyone attempts to post
  something that either defends or makes positive reference to
  Suburban Express
  information.

Actually
removed. I have even used my moderation ability to whitelist positive
postings by frequent members of the community. I have only removed
postings that were either spam (Such as someone creating multiple
accounts)
information, or otherwise unsuitable for the content
of the subreddit, and
determining which posts are made by legitimate users is not something
I can do with 100% accuracy.

&gt; This exercise of control over the reddit postings by you are clearly
  done for no other purpose than to harm the business interest of my
  client.

The primary goal of my posting and action is to further the discussion
and community of /r/uiuc. I also aim to prevent the many readers and
students who get their information from /r/uiuc from being targeted by
lawsuits. 

&gt; You further claim to know that some and/or all of the posts which
  are negative about Suburban Express are being made by someone at
  Suburban Express
  your thoughts.

I will assume that you meant 'postive' instead of 'negative' since
surely SubEx wouldn't be insulting itself.

I don't have any proof. However
many of the users agree with me. There probably is such proof
however
- a counter-claim of harassment would reveal the IP logs during
discovery. You can ask your client if that would be a good thing
bad thing

&gt; The fact that you are taking these actions to remove anything which
  might counterbalance the negativity expressed against Suburban
  Express evidences your intent to maintain this reddit thread to
  interfere with and harm the business interests of Suburban Express.

As discussed
not my intent.

&gt; My client also takes issue with a heading on your thread where you
  inform people ""don't ride Suburban Express! They are likely to sue
  you
  of Suburban Express though this year and the year of 2012
  percentage of customers who are sued for violating the terms and
  conditions is so minuscule as to make your claims about being sued
  false
  terrible reviews.

Peoria Charter has sued none of it's passengers. I don't know of any
other local bus company that has. Over a hundred lawsuits
comparatively

If you're trying to argue that 1.5/5 stars is not ""terrible reviews""
than you need to visit internet review sites more often. That is
clearly bad.

I stand by these claims
change in the behavior of your client and receive a public apology for
his actions.

&gt; Accordingly
  damages from your false and libelous postings by removing the items
  at issue by April 27
  pursuit of legal actions against you as a result of your conduct.

Again
libelous. Please be specific in the future so we can discuss the
individual assertions within them.

As far as I can see
probably guilty of harassment

I welcome your response. I'd also encourage you to make an account on
Reddit if you do not already have one
subreddit. You could even do a ""AMA"" style posting (short for Ask Me
Anything) - I'm sure many of our community members would love to ask
questions about what it's like to be a lawyer and what it's like to
represent Suburban Express.

Valediction

1372381423.0,1h7usw,(Yet Another) Suburban Express Story,lemurthelemur,144,39,100,"I took a Suburban Express bus to and from the suburbs in October

On the ride home, my license, all of my money, my debit card (connected to all the money I'd made hostessing at a restaurant after school), amongst other things. Needless to say, for a freshman barely with her foot in the door, it was a stressful event to occur mid-semester. 

I submitted a lost item report to Suburban Express online, maybe I would have gotten my stuff back.

I called

I detailed, and I quote because I can still remember this...

""If it was so important

I was silent for a moment

After that disastrous call, before I paid for a shipping label, I wanted to see a picture of what they found (I didn't want to pay to ship something that might not be mine). After I sent an email requesting details about the item, which for me means something as simple as a quick photo, I never got a response.

The email Suburban Express sent to me indicated I could pick up my purse from their 714 S Sixth Street office. On a trip to visit a friend in CU for the summer I stopped into their office

When I arrived

Whoever he was, he riffled through a small box. He then told me (with the posture and voice of one who is lying or caught mid wrongdoing) that some of the lost and found had been moved to the Lisle Office. After that, he sort of tried to shoo me out but, flustered and not suspicious of foul-play,  I stopped him and left him my contact information (my name and email). 

I never heard from them again until JUNE 25

I received a message from Suburban Express

I don't know what happened to my purse. I don't know what is wrong with this company. If they located it on May 13, in person. 

I sent an email explaining this entire situation and they never responded. It has been multiple business days since I sent my email.

I never went in there before but had to go in and get a lab manual. While in there, Walgreens, TIS, and other stores were charging about $7 for 4 AAAs. They also have a ton of cool things that I wanted to buy and I'm sure they were cheap too: keyboards, mice, headphones, usbs. Call ahead if you're looking for something specific obviously. They also have circuit parts but I'm sure if you needed circuit parts then you already knew that.

**The point of this post is to educate you on how to protect yourself against law enforcement.  If you have an emergency


**-- What is the Fourth Amendment? --**


The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects you from unreasonable searches and seizures from the US government.  The actual text is:


""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and the persons or things to be seized.""


I had to memorize this in high school (and I can still recite it!), papers, and effects"" and  ""no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause"".


That first statement says that police cannot search you, or effects.  The courts usually hold a persons residence to the highest standard of privacy, and so that is the most protected by the amendment.  If an officer stops you, the only thing you are required to tell them is your name and address.  **You do not have to show ID!**.


The second statement states that a police officer must have ""probable cause"".  The courts deem probable cause to be that which a ""a reasonable belief that a person has committed a crime"", they do not have probable cause.


**-- Exceptions to the Fourth Amendment --**


There are, but I will go over the relevant ones for parties, etc.


* Consent: The major exception is consent.  Your Fourth Amendment right can be given up at any moment, or your residence, reply with ""I do not consent to any searches"".** That is an unambiguous and firm answer.
**You should also know that if you did give away consent at any point

* Plain View Doctrine: Anything that can be considered ""in plain sight"" by a law enforcement officer, by the way.  Take note, ents.  **Therefore, you should not open your door or windows without first making sure that no one is behind you and there is no evidence of alcohol in sight.  Close and lock your door behind you when you step outside.**


* Exigent Circumstances: This exception covers all emergencies where an officer thinks that someone or their property is in danger.  It also covers cases where getting a warrant would take too long and the evidence is about to be destroyed.  **This


* Incident to Lawful Arrest: **If you are arrested


**-- How to Deal with Law Enforcement --**


**Above all


First off, you will be less likely to get in trouble if you aren't swearing at them.


Secondly, on the other hand, does allow the to charge you with Obstruction of Justice.


Third


Finally


**EDIT: The four sentences you should need when talking to police:**

* ""I do not consent to any searches.""
* ""Am I being detained?""
* ""Am I free to go?""
* ""What is your name and badge number?""

The only other thing you have to say in Illinois is your name and address (although whether you actually have to give these is iffy).  Beyond that

Hey everyone

-Frequently barge into your apartment. They will knock, regardless of what you may be doing and regardless of if you yell ""please go away, this is a bad time!"" or not. Their way around this is taping a ""viewing schedule"" to your door that lists viewing hours every day as 10am-10pm. This is, like most things, not mentioned in the lease.

-The apartments are not kept up. When I moved in, ours clearly had not, since you couldn't walk on it without shit sticking to your feet. There were dirtmarks on the wall, little holes burned in our carpet, tons of mysterious black goop on the bathroom floor, a window with several 3-foot cracks in it, and hair EVERYWHERE. It took about a week to get the apartment livable.

-The furniture and appliances are all broken. Most of our chairs and tables had broken (if wood) or bent (if metal) legs on them. The appliances were all 30+ years old and barely worked, the power randomly goes out in our bathroom frequently, and the lack of service on air conditioners caused a water clog that flooded the parking garage and caused a 4 foot hole in the ceiling, which would have caused tons of damage to any car that would have been parked under it at the time.

-They will royally screw you on your lease payments. My current lease ends a full 16 days before the day it started last August, however true it may be, and that my attitude would have an impact on how much of my security deposit is returned. 

Yes

UDJ is a social music player. It allows a group of people to add songs to a single playlist, and also vote songs up and down. The playlist then puts the most popular songs at the front of the queue, and pushes unpopular songs to the back.

Our website is [www.udjplayer.com](https://www.udjplayer.com/). There you can download the UDJ player for Mac, and there are also links to the mobile app store pages. We have apps for Android, iPhone and Windows phone and are currently working on a web app as well. We don't want anyone to be left out.

We hope that we've solved the problem of people drunkenly taking the iPod hostage at parties by letting everyone have a say in what music is played. We're very happy with our work and are ready to share it with UIUC and the rest of the world. Feedback is always welcome

Here's the list


**The ARC and CRCE!** Never again in our lives will we have the opportunity to pay nothing for unlimited access to a gym at our peak physical condition. Climbing is $2 at the ARC; in my hometown the same access would require $19. [EDIT yes I know we pay for this stuff with our student fees/tuition

**Discounted shows at the Krannert Center.** Cheap tickets

The **Krannert Art Museum** is free. You should at least go once.

**Free transportation!** The MTD goes just about everywhere you need to go on an everyday basis

**Access to academic journals.** Though you probably won't need them that much after graduation

**Cold packs, and practically everything at McKinley.** You might not need them that often, but they come up in the clutch when you need them to.

**[The FabLab!](http://cucfablab.org/)** It's a little-known place

**Writing helpers** come in handy when you just whipped up an essay and need to see if it's total shit or not. They know their stuff.

There are many **free sports games** out there. Out of all of the free events, Illini Hockey is exciting and relatively cheap, at $6 per student ticket.

**Free newspapers.** The NYT, as well as the Daily Illini and News-Gazette are free in various dorms and public campus locations. I get mine at PAR, but surely they are lying around the Union, UGL, etc.

**Free food on the first week

**[Free motorcycle lessons!](http://www.mrp.uiuc.edu/)**

**[The UIUC Webstore](http://webstore.illinois.edu/home/)** offers discounted software for a good chunk off retail prices. Some stuff is free too.

The **[Meat Sciences Lab](http://events.ansci.illinois.edu/meat_sales/)** near PAR offers meat for discount prices.

You can access **Lynda.com**

**Discounted electronics in the Everitt basement.**


And from cafarelli....
&gt; I can't believe no one else has said something like ""unlimited use of the 4th largest library in the nation!""

*I write today to inform you that University of Illinois President Michael J. Hogan has tendered his resignation

*President Hogan joined the University at a very challenging time, and was under such significant financial constraint that furloughs and salary freezes were required. The Board sought out a reform-minded leader and was glad to find Mike Hogan, a veteran and accomplished educational leader with a distinguished record, who was committed to carrying out an exhaustive mandate of change with a sense of necessary urgency. We were not the only university pursuing him. Ultimately, he chose to lead the University of Illinois because of its reputation and his belief that he could make a difference.*

*In his nearly two years as President, offsetting declines in state funding and late payments from the state. He has successfully recruited a highly talented leadership team and implemented the first merit-based salary increase in three years. There have been no furlough days on his watch. During his tenure, state appropriations have remained essentially level, notwithstanding the state budget crisis.*

*It has not been easy. Some of what Mike Hogan was compelled to do was not popular, perseverance, and achievement.* 

*The Board feels that the most appropriate next step in university leadership should come from a proven administrator with a track record of collaboration and success within our University.*

*On Friday, and he repaired and rebuilt the campus both literally and figuratively. Bob started at the U. of I. as a doctoral student, and then 36 years ago, as a faculty member. He was dean of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences before acting as interim provost and then interim chancellor, then retiring, just briefly, jobs and new taxes to benefit the state. He has the trust of alumni and trustees past and present, the best interest of students at heart. Following a transition period

*The Board joins me in wishing Mike well and in welcoming Bob back to play another key role for our beloved University of Illinois.*


*Sincerely
*Christopher G. Kennedy*
*Chairman

1358015258.0,16g2sq,9 Textbook Buying Tips Every Illini Should Know,effyoutom,84,18,35,"As the semester starts I'm sure many of you are wondering how you can get books without forking over a fortune for texts. Here are a few tips to save you some dough I've learned over the past 3.5 years as a student from a low-income family:

* 1) All instructors are required to make texts available on reserve (usually at the main stacks or ugl). If the instructor is giving you a BS ""invest in your education"" response or is resisting to do so in any way explain how not putting the book on reserve (either in a library or on e-reserves) is an act of discrimination against low income students. **Be polite in emails** and go above your professor only if they refuse to put something on reserve.

* 2) Use our library system! There are usually a few copies of smaller books/novels in one of the over 20 libraries on campus. Check early before the semester starts and you can renew a book up to 4 times (that's 14 weeks).

* 3) Use the I-SHARE system (http://vufind.carli.illinois.edu/all/vf/). You can use your UIUC Library account to access this. Basically how this works is you search a database of university libraries in Illinois for books you need. If you find it

* 4) Help yourself and other Illini by using the Illini Book Exchange (http://www.illinibookexchange.com/splash.php5). Here you can buy and sell used texts (this is especially nice for harder to find math/science/engineering texts).

* 5) Rent you texts! You can do this at one of the local greedy textbook shops or online through various websites (Amazon

* 6) If you absolutely need to buy a text, or the Union Bookstore unless you can't find cheaper options online. These stores are convenient but are almost always incredibly expensive.

* 7) Buy or rent older editions of textbooks. Many professors write the books for their classes and require students to buy the most up to date edition. 9 out of 10 times these new editions are just scams to get more money. Most professors will be honest when you ask if an older edition is okay

* 8) Share texts with friends. If you need to buy an expensive text

* 9) Thank your professors/TA's who make every effort to get texts on reserves and help you find the cheapest option. It is always refreshing to meet a university instructor who actually cares about you as a student.

* Hope these help! Please comment with any additional tips.

**Ratelimiting Classes**: Yes, asymmetric limit. Think 4GB down, 2GB up for class B and then something like 8GB down and 4GB up for class A. These numbers are entirely speculation at this point, but we are working to not only go to a system like this, but also increase the amount of bandwidth included in the caps due to a decreasing cost of bandwidth. The most popular methods of downloading large files that I've heard of are either using WiFi in a lounge or library, or downloading them on a computer lab machine (100Mb/s). [Negated Void](http://www.reddit.com/user/NegatedVoid) pointed out that more tech-savvy users can figure out how to download through the lab machines to their local machine.  
  
**Wireless**: Currently Wireless halls include Barton, Daniels, Busey-Evans, and new for Fall 2012 - Scott! These are currently not monitored at all for bandwidth, and you are free to use as much as you please (this is how I download most of my Steam games, OS images, etc). Even if you don't live in one of these halls, CITES and Housing are looking to develop a rate limiting system based on NetID. Note that since you are logged in with your NetID (through either IllinoisNet or UIUCNet)
  
**MAC Spoofing**: This is something we are very aware of, we will call you on it. First time, probably a cease and desist email. Second time, you might have to actually meet with someone. That being said, we don't look at rooms that just exceed their regularly allotted amount - that's what the rate limiting system is for. If we see you doing a few gigs a day through connections that are most likely file sharing, we don't care. We do not address copyright issues until a copyright holder contacts us with your IP.  
  
**Whitelisting**: Another thing we are working on is getting certain sites (Netflix, but we are very near a solution for this. I wouldn't be surprised if at least Netflix and Youtube were whitelisted at some point during the Fall 2012 semester. Unfortunately Netflix [stopped using Akamai](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/2012/06/05/netflix-shifts-traffic-to-its-own-cdn-akamai-limelight-shrs-hit/) as it's primary CDN this Summer which has put a bit of a hiccup in the plan. All on-campus traffic is whitelisted, and you can download (nearly) any Linux distro from [COSMOS](http://cosmos.cites.uiuc.edu).  
  
**Quarantine Networks**: While the CITES security team is responsible for all of the quarantining that takes place on campus (RESnet and Wireless), we typically know what we're looking for. Unfortunately, cleaning these things often takes persistence and false positives can occur making our job all the more difficult.   
  
**Copyright Infringement**: Torrenting itself is legal, **we (housing) will never confront a student about downloading copyrighted materials without first receiving a claim from a copyright holder**. The university receives an IP from a company typically hired by the copyright holder, and then it is the NetTechs job to follow up with them and make sure the content is removed. NetTechs have no power over these tickets aside from aiding the RDs in checking out a computer. We are not the ones that disable copyright rooms, nor are we the ones to reenable them.

**Impersonation Scandal at University of Illinois**

On December 12
 These emails concerned a controversial initiative over how much association the three University of Illinois campuses should have in terms of admissions and enrollment. Generally, prefers more centralization, while the faculty tend to prefer keeping the campuses processes separate. The anonymous senator urged the USC, which is composed of 20 University of Illinois faculty members, to say they are unable to reach a consensus. 

This suggestion is controversial because without a consensus

However, noted that the text of the first anonymous email contained information from MS Word, and this information indicated that the email had been composed on a computer containing the user account “troyer.” 

“Troyer” is the last name of Michael Hogan’s then Chief of Staff/executive assistant, Iowa, and Connecticut) and was given immediate tenure upon arriving at UIUC with a $195,000 salary (now $200,850). According to a full forensics investigation that was launched upon Lisa Troyer’s implication, we know the following from her phone logs, e-mails, and witness statements:

Troyer had written to Hogan earlier in the week, “I hope tomorrow gives you a new view and that you have a better day.” 

That evening

Despite not being a member of the USC, a strategy is outlined by USC leaders to write to Hogan as a unified group, so that Hogan cannot say they are divided and to avoid a public relations disaster. Troyer and Hogan wrote an e-mail the next day to the Board Chair, Chris Kennedy, expressing displeasure with the new strategy that was leaked to them.

Two days later, and that their meeting was quickly interrupted by a phone call from Michael Hogan. Troyer’s phone records show a call from Hogan at 12:16 pm.

Many who received the first anonymous email objected to the spirit of the message and the anonymity employed by the writer. Troyer sends another e-mail in reply stating that anonymity is used because of the growing divide and hostility within the USC and asks for continuing debate over consensus in the group. She also asks for the USC to not look into the person who leaked the draft report (i.e. USC member Ting) because it probably came from a person outside the group. During this time

It is after this second e-mail that Roy Campbell notices the information in the e-mail that identifies Troyer. He writes to the rest of the Senate and informs them of his finding.

Tih-Fen Ting

Four minutes after their phone conversation, after seeing how long the process will take, Troyer aborts the program. Lisa Troyer admits to deleting some files that night. The program log files indicate that it had never been used previously.

Lisa Troyer then calls Michael Hogan. Hogan advises her to contact Michael Hites, Ting, and Hites.

The University Ethics Office and the Office of University Counsel conducted a full investigation. The investigation found that the file systems on the Troyer Laptop did not contain any known virus, or other potentially malicious software. Additionally, the system activity on the Troyer Laptop was consistent with network activity reported by the University IT Dept., and found no inconsistencies that would indicate malicious activity.

In summary, the organization of Troyer’s office, her  work schedule, University network firewall, the firewall on Troyer’s laptop, the security of university e-mail account,  artifacts found on Lisa Troyer’s computer, detailed and current information about the various discussions and issues surrounding the enrollment management issue make it highly unlikely that anyone but Troyer could have sent those anonymous e-mails. After being presented with the forensic findings

Lisa Troyer, attempt to divide a recommendation committee, high cost imposed to the University through an extensive forensics investigation, lack of publishing/research, and possible damage done to the University’s ranking), the status of her tenure is still unknown.

The Senate Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure will, chaired by Matthew Finkin, investigates possible infringement of academic freedom and allegations of violations of the role of faculty in governance as specified in the University Statutes.  From their investigations, they submit recommendations and reports to the Chancellor and the Senate.

**A Personal Plea**

This investigation cost money and time that could have been spent funding research

We need to let the administration, but I think we can make things better than they were by sending a message to the public that we take unethical behavior more seriously than any other institution.

1375416958.0,1jjmdz,PSA: Don't let your research lab abuse you,biopsych,71,9,32,"Dear undergrads (such as myself)

To those of you who are new to the field of research, some of the researchers on this campus are taking advantage of us by offering us ""opportunities"" that offer us minimal benefit in the long run. I'm talking about situations where undergrads aren't taught enough about what the lab is doing, not properly introduced to what it's like to be a researcher, and not given any sort of significant independence or ability to perform as an actual scientist. I know this first hand. 

I don't mean to say that undergrads shouldn't do grunt work, and there is no benefit to you to have your research listed in your transcript because it will be on your application or your resume regardless. Edit: This is true for pass/fail 290s but be wary of 290s that assign you a grade based on an essay. Undergrads need to be able to grow as scientists if they're going to be taken seriously by future institutions.

Here are some tips on how to find a good lab. If anyone else has anything to say

* Don't agree to work in a lab before asking what kinds of things undergrads are able to do there. The idea is that you should be working there with the goal of doing something more impressive within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. writing a paper

* Ask if there are weekly meetings
* You should be seeking out your lab, you don't have to have a passion for it already), and then contact the PIs (principle investigators) of those labs and ask them if they need help. Don't stress out about it, you're basically asking them if they need free help. Just be respectful and professional.
* You're not a lab tech, be ready to pay your dues as thanks to the researchers who will hopefully help you move on to the next big thing.
* Just an FYI

The University of Illinois is a world-class research institution. Don't fall into a trap as you're looking for the right lab for you.",,t5_2qkxs,1375421733.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/1jjmdz/psa_dont_let_your_research_lab_abuse_you/

**MAIN POST:**

Hey folks

But I noticed Suburban Express is now proudly proclaiming their ""A+ Rating with BBB"" on the front page of their website. [Link.](http://suburbanexpress.com/indexuiuc.html) They link to the [listing for SubEx](http://www.bbb.org/central-illinois/business-reviews/bus-lines/suburban-express-in-champaign-il-5001684) on the Better Business Bureau's website. It indeed shows that they maintain an A+ rating according to the Central Illinois BBB. I'd think that it would be at least a notch lower, with 7 categorized as ""Problems with Product / Service"".

But anyway...**if you recently had a bad experience with Suburban Express, honest, and concise.** Hopefully this would make them aware of a problem with SE (they're not a member anyway), and maybe lead to SE no longer displayed as an ""A+"" business with no problems. If relevant to your situation, also consider filing a complaint with the state Attorney General and/or other offices where relevant.

The BBB page on SE also points out that SE doesn't have BBB accreditation. ""Accreditation"" is their membership program where businesses pay an annual fee and BBB somehow monitors their business practices. If all is good, chances are they couldn't.

Of course I know that the BBB isn't popular with everyone...it's received its fair share of criticism, some people do. They might see the BBB as a reliable source of information about which businesses are or aren't reputable. Or they may be new to the US (eg international students), and mistake the BBB for a government agency when it's not. (oh yeah, and please note that I'm not a lawyer, and that this post doesn't constitute legal advice.)",,False,t5_2qkxs,True

How To: UIUC edition

**GET AN APARTMENT:**

-Email the tenant union. Give specifications like town, and furnished/unfurnished.

-Don’t use CPM or University Group

Urbana tends to be cheaper

-Expect to start leasing for an apartment in early october the year before you want to live there. Yeah

-Don't feel the need to live in an apartment sophomore year--don't sign a lease with your brand-new-dorm-friends before you really know them.


**OH EM GEE I’M AN INCOMING FRESHMAN:**

-No one cares about if you’ll get into UIUC or not, its not a great representation. Use the schools website, or advisors. At least use the search function first!!

*Tips on what to bring your freshman year...from an Iguide!*

from TaikongXiongmao:
For dorm stuff, it WILL break. The outdoor trash cans are full of them every year &gt;_&lt; Buy one at target or walmart, after you've moved in so you can carry it the whole drive back.

Other things I would recommend:

    A cushion for your chair (it can be a pillow from home

    A desk light, but trust me, if either you or your roommate is going to be coming in after one of you is asleep, it is a life saver! No one gets mad because the extra bright room light is on, or that they can't see and end up tripping over everything.

    A cheap box fan

    Mattress topper

    A small dry erase board

Things I would NOT recommend:

    An entirely new chair. You won't have room and the dorm chairs are fine if you throw a pillow on it.

    A floor lamp of any sort. Again

    Buying sheets before you get there! My parents insisted that my bed would be a ""x-long twin"" but the website lies

    A TV (your dorm friends will have one). Or at least make sure you and your roommate aren't both bringing one.

The YMCA Dump and Run is a great way to get a bunch of random things you might need for super cheap

-*Guide to the dorms*

Allen is artsy

-Busey-Evans is quiet

-LAR is Busey Evans

Ikenberry-Has its own rec center

Six pack--Loud

ISR-Quiet

PAR/FAR: Large international and black community

Private housing-quiet, and not very diverse. Plus, you can only get into your dorm's kitchen. With public dorms, you can eat in any of the 7 dorms--nice when you have friends in a different dorm, you want greasy food (PAR!) or you live far away and want to eat between classes (Busey-Evans)

-You’ll be fucking fine without air conditioning

-don’t buy all that nonsense your parents think you need because they read it in a parenting magazine. They tell you how important desk lamps and macbooks and drapes and pop up hampers and such are--feel out your first 2 weeks without the frilly things

-Buying a minifridge (not really necessary) costs the same as renting one. Will become beer fridge post dorms

*Recommendations on laptops and computing*
Don't feel like you have to get a laptop:many people only bring them to class to use FB, and someone else will always have one. Also, keep in mind weight: if it's heavy, you're not going to want to carry it around everywhere, and it might be a better investment to get a netbook and a good desktop. Also keep in mind battery life: 2.5 hours will get you through 2 classes.

from neoblackdragon:
When it comes to a computer. I think it depends fully on your needs. If your just doing basic stuff like surfing the web and writing papers then a ""cheap"" good laptop is all you need. You don't need a hardcore laptop and you don't need an overpriced macbook. Do your research before you buy. Thinkpads are a good place to start. Go into desktop territory if your a person who run programs that need the power. You don't need to be a gamer for that. If your in the Art program

But if you got 2000 dollars to spend. DO NOT BUY A MAC. Buy yourself another brand(stay away from dell). Save yourself some money. I have found many mac pro professors and students are not choosing the line because Macs are inherently better but because they don't know how to use a computer(or they they've been on the MAC OSX for so long that the Windows/Linux OS seem to foreign).

I'd say looks toward a decent priced laptop first while in the dorms. If you find you need a desktop

from mysassyassy:
One more thing, has plenty of battery power, and it is not expensive.

*pros/cons of laptops vs desktops*
from vxxk:
Desktops are not portable and sometimes you might need to do work on a computer outside your dorm but computers in labs/libraries are not accessible. Laptops, or require desktop for a specific purpose, or you simply can't afford a laptop. Do not buy Apple as Windows, or Linux, will be cheaper and will perform the same function. 

Note: outside the dorms, UGL, whatever), which in the more popular studying libraries, there are mac labs scattered around campus.
they are free for any student and offer printing for .08/.40 BW/Color.
They are located in: Southwest corner of the union
Northeast corner of the UGL
On Nevada (Behind La Casa)
Oregon and Lincoln
Basement of Wohlers

**Class Recommendations:**
*MUS 133

*PSYC 100

GWS 100 and CHLH 206 are easy as shit. --from frycicle. I won't lie though


You can also do concurrent enrollment at Parkland (the community college near UIUC). They have online classes that are probably easier than the UIUC equivalent.

There is a rather large black woman with bad teeth at the intersection of Wright and Green who is asking for money.  She claims she is pregnant and needs the money for food; she also mentioned something about her sister.  She is large enough that it would be hard to tell if she is lying about the pregnancy.  I saw and talked to her about an hour ago

About this same time last year this same woman asked me for cash further down the street (Wright and Daniels-ish) with the same story

1368201625.0,1e2p7z,Yet another fun Suburban Express Story!!,vdubzzz,76,21,44,"This is my first post on Reddit ever

I was on a 4am bus to O'hare -- an hour and half into the bus ride I woke up from my nap to see we are stopped outside a Denny's in bumfuck nowhere (well at least it had a Denny's). I figured it was just a pit stop and didn't quite mind. Then the driver announces that he just got a call from who I now think was probably Dennis the Menace that they have detected duplicate tickets. The two passengers were called out, but they had two DIFFERENT confirmation e-mails that they showed the driver. They didn't have any further proof, and I'm not even sure if that was legitimate. We were sitting there for about 40 minutes, waiting for what seemed like nothing, and that's when the driver was told to call law enforcement to help intimidate these guys. We waited there in silence (again this was 5:30 AM) for the fucking police to show up. Ultimately, I guess the two customers couldn't plead their case well enough, because after about 10-15 more minutes, and then we were off once again.

My biggest problem with this is how they made their ""honest"" customers wait for OVER an HOUR just so they could fuck with their ""fraudulent"" customers and kick them off the bus in again, my flight had a nice two hour buffer. But that probably wasn't the case with many of the passengers on the same bus as me. In that recent e-mail they said they value their customers tremendously. They sure do have a very interesting way of showing their appreciation of us. ",,False,,t5_2qkxs,False,,

not a student was drinking and townies hunkered down 


The Handles and beer kegs were prepared with care 


In the hopes that a great party would soon be declared


The Students were nestled all snug in their beds 


While visions of drinking games were played in their heads 


And St. Patrick in his hat and KAM with his beer 


Had just ended the preparations for the rager of the year


When out on the Quad there arose such a clatter


I sprang from my bunk to see what was the matter. 


Away to the window I flew like the flash 


Tore open the blinds and the window with a crash


The moon on the breast of the newly cleaned street 


Gave the luster of St Patty’s day to the drunks on their feet 


When


 But a gigantic keg


With a little old redhead


I knew in a moment it must be St Pat 


More rapid than eagles his beverages they came 


And he whistled

“Now Natty! Now Keystone! Now


On Blue Ribbon! On Fosters on Busch and Coors light! 


Go into the bars! Into the sororities and frats!


Now drink away! drink away! Until the whole world goes black!""

Do you enjoy climbing buildings or sneaking past security to catch a glimpse of the view from the roof? Or perhaps you like traversing the steam tunnels, I've been doing all this for quite some time and have finally started a blog dedicated to the subject of urban exploration and infiltration in C-U.(http://catacombkid217.wordpress.com/). I've only made one post so far, but there is more to come. Anyway, I was wondering if anyone else engages in these activities and would have photos to submit or would possibly like to accompany me to visit some sites. I'm particularly interested in anyone who has a good camera and is half decent at using it; I can guarantee some unique pictures you won't get elsewhere!

http://www.dailyillini.com/index.php/article/2009/03/unlucky_day_revives_urban_legends_at_university
Still cool though!

LOGISTICS: Enter Noyes through the North-West entrance
Go down the stairs.  There's this old lookin' brick hallway that's really warm.  Go straight though it.  About halfway through, like, a chain linked fence section that's locked up.  Behind the fence you'll see all these old computers, and lots of random papers lying around, and it'll be really dark.  You'll also notice a gap in the wall, kinda like the opening to an old school pizza oven.  This gap goes to what I'll call the Central Room.
Now, which is just South of the Grave Site Room.  But this trap door was bolted.
I also understand that another way people have reached the grave is by having a Chem student with keys to the old storage room just North of the Grave Site Room (door 14, so that option was not viable as far as I know.
The chain linked fence locked up doorway that I mentioned earlier has about a foot and half gap from the top of it's doorway to a pipe that runs along the ceiling.  Enough room for most people.  I climbed up the door

STORY: It was me and a couple friends
It was pitch dark in there.  All I had was my shitty old cell phone for light
This Central Room didn't really have much to it.  I think I remember a filing cabinet or two.  I decided to go left.  This led to a doorway to another room.  This room didn't seem to have a dirt floor.  A lot more junk though.  There was a light switch by this doorway on the Central Room's side.  I held my breath and flicked it on.  Nothing happened
Next I went right/North.  There was this short, dimly lit, I could make out the cross that I'd seen in all the pictures I'd seen of the grave.  I'd made it!  But before I went to further investigate that, further ahead/North, there was another doorway that caught my curiosity.
It was a square, but a square floor with a shitty, short li'l step ladder that led to a ventilation thingy with enough room for someone to army crawl over.  I did just that (it was really, really warm!) and I could make out a much bigger room with a lot of tall filing-cabinet-like things.  I decided not to enter any further as there seemed to be a bit of a drop to the floor and I had already found the grave.
I crept back to the grave.  I could tell the picture of Edward Williams Morley was gone
I only got a glimpse because all I had was my not-so-powerful phone, were two pale faces, mouths open, seeming to be screaming in agony.
Back to the Central Room, I knew I wasn't going to leave it at that.  My curiosity was a little to strong to have my adventure end there.  I just needed an actual flashlight, and a camera.
We got those items and I returned.  Imagine seeing this, way darker:
http://i.imgur.com/iVtAo.jpg
So it turns out it was just someone's art project that they left down there (which is what I *totally* thought the whole time):
http://i.imgur.com/Cdvgr.jpg
and I guess I kinda just imagined the whole gaping-mouths thing:
http://i.imgur.com/Hr7ue.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/lBeS7.jpg

To whoever left those down there

MORAL: I often see posts on r/UIUC for urban exploration.  We should totally try to organize something!  There's so much to explore!  I even was taught how to get on the roof of Noyes that night!  It's really awesome up there!

I’m a student at the University of York in the UK and I’m working on an application for an exchange to UIUC in the next academic year. I’m a history/philosophy undergrad and the program I’m applying for is a history specific single semester exchange. I’ve done an awful lot of googling about UIUC to try and make my application sound clever and informed but it’d really help if I could get a bit of input from a current or past student

If you guys don’t mind I have a couple of massively general questions:
1.	Is there anything particularly special about liberal arts teaching at UIUC?
2.	 What’s awesome/interesting about the departments of history/philosophy/medieval studies? (i.e. range of courses
3.	If you were trying to sell UIUC (in a general sense) to a prospective student what sort of stuff would you say?

I’d really appreciate any help I can get. Also

Would say I’d buy helpful redditors a beer if I get a place but I’m not legal in the US so I’ll buy you a non-alcoholic beverage of your choice.

1. Lower to 12 hours and aim for a 3.5 semester

2. Devote 10 hours of school focused time a day including class time

3. Take the time to review past material. Learn it better than you did before

4. Study lecture to lecture

As many of you already know, this vote does not mean we have declared a strike. Instead, based on our constitution, this vote creates a new committee with the executive power to declare, suspend, or call off a strike. 

For those of you who already have a good grasp on the issues but want to know how to get involved

I teach two undergrad classes and have openly invited my students to e-mail me their direct questions or ask about rumors they have heard. I am inviting you to do the same. The goal of this is to help anyone who hasn't been a part of our negotiation process to understand what our priorities are

This is an AMAA

* The start date of a work action/strike
* Buildings that would be targeted for picket lines
* How long a potential strike could last
* Whether your own graduate instructors will hold or cancel classes
* **Rampart** 

I hope to bring in one or two other union leaders to help answer questions tomorrow!

Before I go on with my question

I transferred here in Fall 2010 as a sophomore. The only person that I knew (outside of friends of acquaintances) who went to Illinois was my boyfriend at the time. These two things are important because 1. I came here after the Chief was no longer our mascot and 2. Unlike many people who go here, outside of a slight negative feeling.

The [APA](http://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/indian-mascots.aspx) and the [NCAA](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=2125735) both agree that the use of Native American mascots is harmful and creates a ""hostile environment"". I can definitely see where they're coming from.

So to those of you who support the use of the Chief: why? How do you feel about the views from organizations like the APA? 

**tl;dr: I came to this school after the Chief was retired and didn't know anyone who came here/was never exposed to love for the Chief. I don't really have much of an opinion either way and I'm curious as to why people are such strong defenders of the mascot.**

Thanks! =D

**Edit: Wow, to be honest!**

**It seems like this whole thing is broken down two different ways.**

**For: The Chief was a symbol of honor, and other positive things. He brought the campus community together and was an important part of the University culture. The loss of this symbol has left a hole in the community. Since he was always portrayed respectfully, and had support from Native Americans at some point (?), it is unfair to call him racist and anyone who says otherwise is being oversensitive or is unaware of all of the details of the Chief. Some people have said that the Chief was banned simply because the NCAA wished it to be so, without any feedback from the campus community. Some people in this group respect the decision to cease use of the Chief, while some are very unhappy with it.**

**Against: The Chief is a racist caricature of what it means to be Native American. He would dress up in the expected attire, community, and other important aspects of NA culture. Positive stereotypes/generalization are still harmful to minority groups, and the Chief and Native Americans are an example of this.**

It's pretty simple to get a good response from recruiters at the career fairs. 75% of the students go about it the wrong way. I cannot tell you how many students come up to us (the recruiters) asking what we do

This is how you do it. 

1) Decide ahead of time that you are going to go to the career fair. Go as early as you possibly can. You want to leave an early lasting impression and have a thoughtful discussion with the recruiter before they get burned out after talking to 3000 other students. (For the love of god

2) Carefully look at every company that is attending. Decide which ones you are interested in and learn a few things about this company (especially if it's a smaller company). Now examine the job openings they have. Figure out which one(s) you want and come up with an elevator speech that specifically tells the recruiter why you are qualified for this position. 

3) Like I said before, Z. Follow up with why you think you would be a great fit for position A - and give a few more reasons. To really show you are interested - come up with a few thoughtful questions to ask about this position/company as well. 

4) At this point

5) Profit.

I know r/uiuc has a history of being somewhat anti-greek

To start here’s the list of fraternities in [IFC](http://www.odos.uiuc.edu/greek/scholarship/ifcGrades.asp) (Inter-fraternity Council) and the sororities in the [Panhellenic Council](http://www.odos.uiuc.edu/greek/scholarship/panGrades.asp) 

Some of the larger/ high quality threads are:

* [a recent thread about Rush](http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/x3hpu/rush_week_at_uiuc/) This has a lot of good content on how to go about rushing

* [as an international student is there a risk that it'll be harder for me to get a bid? Or does it differ from fraternity to fraternity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/so138/question_about_greek_life_at_uiuc/)

* While I wasn’t planning on much discussion about sororities

* [This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/jp8lg/frats_and_sororities/) is comparatively small

* If you’ve ever wondered why people joined a fraternity

* Thoughts on rushing as an [incoming Jr. transfer](http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/i3tan/rushing/)

If there are other threads you think should be included

Tonight a little before 1:00am my roommate and I were approached across from Hendrick House by a guy on a bike. He said he was with his girlfriend and they ran out of gas and he needed some gas money so he could get back home. He offered his ring in collateral and promised that he would pay us back. I inspected the ring and could tell that it was from a costume store and told him that neither of us had any money. He then explained that there was an ATM just down the street and he wouldn't mind waiting. He was very insistent and we had to be stern with him to get him to leave us alone.

I am 99% sure this was a scam because I was with my roommate last semester when he was scammed the exact same way. A man approached us in the parking lot behind Lumis and told us almost the exact same story. My roommate gave him $20 and the guy took his phone number and promised he would call and meet up with him and pay him back once he got home. Well he never called.

1292724126.0,eo54r,Absolutely Ridiculous Bus Ride Home on Suburban Express..,caitymo,46,9,54,"**EDIT: This is a complaint about 1 specific driver. I should clarify that prior to this experience I have never had a bad experience with Suburban Express**

I am currently 2 hrs 20 mins into my bus ride back home from Champaign. Anyone who knows me well knows that by taking out my laptop I am going to endure some serious motion sickness in a few minutes. So why, this is how badly I wanted to write down my thoughts about the last two and a half hours. I don’t want to forget to include a single minute of it. So let’s start from the beginning. It’s 12:30 pm and as I’m waiting outside of Altgeld hall, two buses pull up. I look at the yellow signs on the sides of the buses and see: Tinley Park, Woodridge, Oakbrook Mall, Chicago Ridge Mall…no Woodfield yet. Us Woodfielders are informed that our bus will be here in a few minutes. Thinking back, this was the first warning sign. But back then, I just assumed the bus was late just because it must have taken longer to load. Oh past-Cait
So I haul my suitcase over the bike path and load it under the bus. I’m one of the last passengers to board, this is a change of pace from the usual Suburban Express bus drivers. This might be the first driver I’ve gotten who’s not a 55 year old man with a white scruffy beard. But, I thought no more of her appearance and took the only seat available: right behind the driver.  The SubEx boys in their bright yellow jackets closed up the storage under the bus, ensuring our luggage would be secure for the next few hours. 

Now I start to get comfortable: I take off my jacket, the bus is moving. But not this time. Not with Snookie behind the wheel. The buses in front of us have started to leave. Snookie opens the door and while motioning towards the bus in front of her yells out to one of the yellow-jacket boys: “Hey! Get him to stop, it’s not moving again!”  She then honks her horn and messes with some levers and buttons. At this point, I’m intrigued. ‘It’s not moving,’ she said. She can’t possibly mean the bus, can she? She must mean that she can’t get something on the dash to work. Surely, I thought, that’s pretty much her job description. Move the bus from one place to the next. She must, wearing a horse-jockey hat and a leather jacket. Pretty “boss.” Snookie says to him: “yeah, teaching by demonstration didn’t work for the Boss so he tries to explain verbally. I wish I could have heard what he was saying

So finally, you guessed it: she can’t get the bus to start moving again. It takes her a good 30 seconds to a minute to figure it out, but this time Snookie got that bus moving all on her own. Props to her. We begin moving and then we all hear her navigation system:  “continue for 500 meters, and then turn left.”  If I hadn’t already figured out she had never driven for Suburban Express before, the nav system would have given it away. Not that I’m complaining. Because Snookie needs a nav system. *This* I am sure about.  So off we go, and once we’re on 57-North I am a bit more confident that I would actually make it home before midnight, when our bus would turn back into a pumpkin. For the next hour or so things went smoother. At one point she turned back to those of us in the first few rows and said: “If you guys want the radio on...I couldn’t quite figure out how to work it. But you’re welcome to come up and mess with it if you like.” Oh dear, nobody took her up on the invitation. A few mins later, on the highway. All in all
Once she was off the phone, we were in the clear. Oh, past-Cait, once again you are quite naïve. When will you learn? The bus starts to slow, and I wake up from my cat-nap. Snookie gets on the intercom and says, “I’m going to get off the highway and stop at a gas station to get a drink and a snack. We’ll stop for about 10 minutes and you’re all welcome to get off and get a drink too.”  You have got to be kidding me. This is a 3 hour bus ride, do you really need to take a 10 minute pit stop? But, and we pull into a parking lot which she so eloquently describes as: “nice and big.”  She stops the bus and nobody gets off. To which she responds over the intercom, about 10-15 kids get off the bus. I didn’t count. And neither did Snookie. This

After she dismounts, Snookie comes back with a bag of chips and a drink. Kids start coming back onto the bus, and suddenly she realizes her error and looks a bit concerned. “You think everyone’s back?” She asks those of us in the front. Somehow I managed to refrain from laughing in her face, or asking: You mean, you didn’t count how many kids got off?  She looks down the aisle for a bit, straining her eyes, trying to remember (I assume) if the bus was ever at capacity to begin with. She gets on the intercom and asks: “Is everyone who sat next to you back yet?”  To which she receives no response. Apparently this frustrated her, you guys are no help.”  She took this silence to mean everyone was on the bus and started to move again. Someone from the back yelled: there’s one more kid coming! So we wait for him to get on. She asks the kid: “Are you the last one?” He responds with a shrug. This shrug gave Snookie the go-ahead to leave. As she starts to turn the bus around in the lot, but Snookie doesn’t open the door right away. Instead, we’re just about to pull out onto the street and head back to the highway when some kids in the back yell: “there’s one more!”  Sure enough

It’s still possible we left someone behind. I guess we’ll never know. Since taking the laptop out, Snookie proceeded to admit she had no idea where she was going. The nav system will get you to Woodfield Mall, but it won’t get you to lot B4. The kid next to me managed to get her to the lot, but along the way she hit a curb and the whole left half of the bus was up on it for a bit. Snookie shrugged off this 30 second ride on the curb, saying: “I just can’t see the left side of my bus, you know?”  At this point, her words don’t even surprise me. When turning into the lot, and Snookie is annoyed with all the traffic caused by the holiday shopping. “This is the PITS!” she exclaims. She nudges the bus over to the curb in the back of the lot

Daisy is a one year old, but she may ""chunk up"" as she gets older. She's crate-trained, housebroken, hasn't destroyed anything in my house, and gets along with my dogs. She is intelligent but very hyper and relatively untrained. She's picked up on our house rules and is learning very quickly, but still has trouble with walking on leash. She would really benefit from the use of an [Easy Walk Harness](http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2751027&amp;lmdn=Dog+Collars%2C+Tags+%26amp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3B+Leashes&amp;f=PAD%2FpsNotAvailInUS%2FNo). She comes with a crate (not in good shape, you will probably want a replacement), and collar.

The backstory: Daisy was living with a couple until they got divorced. The guy kept the house but didn't want a dog. The woman was unable to find an apartment that allowed dogs, but the other dog has serious documented issues and is clearly the aggressor. Daisy has healing scars on her ear, chest/neck, face and lips/gums.

My name is Lindsay Anderson, or strike. 

As many of you already know, this vote does not mean we have declared a strike. Instead, based on our constitution, this vote creates a new committee with the executive power to declare, suspend, or call off a strike.

For those of you who already have a good grasp on the issues but want to know how to get involved

This is an AMAA

* The start date of a work action/strike
* Buildings that would be targeted for picket lines
* How long a potential strike could last
* Whether your own graduate instructors will hold or cancel classes
* **Rampart**

Looking forward to your questions!

In response, we are going to recommend that you find another mode of transportation between O'Hare and Champaign-Urbana. The situation you describe is entirely of your making. There is absolutely no chance we are going to fire the employee who you dealt with. Unlike you, he is a wonderful person.Regards,Suburban Express""

""Suburban Express, however, as I guess should've been expected from a company with your reputation, you took the low road.  Good luck and I hope that being sarcastic and disrespectful to customers gets you past the minimum wage bus company customer service job that you are currently working.Respectfully,Chris""

After this
""Hey Chris
1) The employee you dealt with is an extremely calm person. We have never witnessed him using profanity
2) Witness account of your situation suggest that you are in fact the one who was doing the swearing.
3) You were told that
4) You then went away and returned wearing sunglasses and perhaps a hat

""Mr. Toeppen
Here are a few things you need to know about your situation:
1)  This employee argued with me and I can promise you that he is in no way a calm person.
2)  I also have witness account
3)  The fact that the employee even suggested this is crazy and shows your lack of care for your customers.
4)  I in no way attempted to disguise my identity, just as I had left the bus.  I made no attempt to pretend I was someone else and it was mutually understood that I was the person who was returning.
I hope you do make your website as it will only further illustrate your intentions to antagonize your loyal customers.  As I mentioned in my letter, something that obviously will not happen by continuing to deal with Suburban Express.
