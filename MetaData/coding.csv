1336158788.0,t79zw,"Am I a dinosaur, or is my new company writing bad code? (C++)",ElderCoder,286,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/t79zw/am_i_a_dinosaur_or_is_my_new_company_writing_bad/, and mention your professional experience for context?

Am I being a dinosaur complaining about these things? I really need to know! The explanation for every item is ""unit tests"" or ""shortens build time"".

* Project is about 6 man-years of code, I have to very carefully move it in projects and source control, in the project files, update DLL exports, update #include paths for other projects, and update linker dependencies. Is this the new normal??
* Every member function is virtual. Many classes derive from an ABC, the mock and the real class. These ABC pointers are passed in constructors, rather than trivially created because ""unit tests"". I can't inspect these ABC pointers in the debugger, sometimes not even with casting magic. My coworkers rely entirely on unit tests rather than debugging. Is this normal?
* Most classes have pImpl implementations. Even the ABC derived classes have pImpl. It only doubles the amount of code for trivial classes. Is everyone doing this now?
* We strictly adhere to 1 class per file. Even small
* Classes are only referred to via boost::shared_ptr. We never use weak pointers or raw pointers, and they end up de-facto owned by some unexpected classes, often with circular shared_ptr ownership. So long as we don't care about closing every handle and deleting every object, this kind of works because we use:
* Signals. We use a lot of boost::signals. With boost signals I can't see who has signed up for a signal in my debugger. I don't see it by inspecting the object

My main complaint is that none of my tools can grok this code. Doxygen generates worthless output because it can't follow the connections. My debugger can't show me program state. This code was written for unit tests and that's the only tool that works. My coworkers believe in this (they wrote it!) and I can't convince them otherwise (I tried!). So give me some advice.

Am I a dinosaur who needs to adapt

So I got my BS in CS. Loved it. I loved doing the programming assignments. The classes were interesting. I did a co-op somewhere in there

For a variety of reasons

I struggled to find a job, and SQL. Not what I had imagined I would be doing, but I thought ""Hey, I'll take it!""

I stayed for 8.5 months

I've been delivering pizza and newspapers for the last 8 months
 - made a huge mistake
 - screwed up my life
 - wasted 7 years of my life and my one opportunity to get ahead

--

Despite how much I've thought about it, depression, and a feeling of fight-or-flight (mostly flight). Even on personal projects...

I used to get excited about programming assignments (in school)

What can I do?

---

tl;dr - Used to love programming

---

Edit:  
Wow, before I quit the banking job. Mostly that session gave me the confidence to move on from that position, as I think it was poisonous for me.

I guess I can explain a bit about the banking position. It was software that banks would use internally, and then I would get assignments which asked me to make changes to these programs. These programs (and the in-house libraries used to build them) generally had very little or no documentation (external or in code comments). But what got me was that I felt I was expected to just know where to go and how to fix these unknown programs from sometimes very brief descriptions (20-50 words). I often found myself pulling my hair out at my cubicle because, for the umpteenth time, I had no idea how to find and fix what I was asked to do. Maybe that's just the way real world programming is... a trawl through uncharted code swamps. It was also frustrating because it sometimes seemed that the most obtuse ways of getting things done were used.

I originally got into programming because, unequivocally, that I wanted to make video games. And then everything seemed doubly reaffirmed when my CS courses were such a blast...

I think another aspect is just fear... fear that... I don't know... I'll hit some roadblock

And now that I've been out for 8 months doing pizza and papers... who is gonna hire me? And they all ask for 3-5 years of experience in ABC, etc, etc, ad nauseum... which I sure I could learn, but have no knowledge of currently.

Also... I live in Alabama... there's not much here job-wise, from what I can tell. Between the mortgage, my wife, her (good) job, and our nearby family, moving doesn't seem to be much of an option.

Even thinking about personal projects like games give me the knee-jerk fear/anxiety reaction...

Anyway... &lt;/whine&gt;

[Here](http://pastebin.com/f5deda543) is a pastebin of the code.

There are some options at the top. Verbose turns on debugging output of what the script is doing, don't try running it with a frame period of 1), where cleanupFramePeriod takes effect after the script has found the end point and is now just collapsing the call stack. outlimit stops the execution after a certain number of frames.

A frame is one call to move\_wavefront, until it can find 0 edges, or it finds the red end point.

Script requires ""maze4.png"" from the first link above to be in the same directory as it is when run. With a long frame period like 1000 and verbose=False, just turn up the frame period.

It is obviously not very general

EDIT: escaped underscores for great justice

EDIT 2: Dependencies are the [Python Imaging Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)

EDIT 3: Removed my address from linked pastebin

EDIT 4: Wikipedia has [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_solving_algorithm) to say about maze solving algorithms. I can't easily classify what I'm using into those algorithms

I'm a CompSci major taking a class about massively parallel programming on CUDA cards, specifically at the systems/OS level.

One of the common opinions I've heard is that this is the result of not having a language built from the ground up with parallelism in mind. Don't get me wrong, there is an extension to C or C++ that almost gets these languages to where they need to be.

What I am basically getting at, and it doesn't mean you can expect good results if you do.

That is to say the user must trust that these services aren't going to harvest the submitted queries.

Pwnedlist.com offers the option to submit a SHA-512 hash of the users query which is a step forward but still leaks information if the query does exist in the database. That is

The solution I came up with is as follows:

1) Instead of the user calculating and submitting the hash herself

    md5(""user@example.com"") = ""b58996c504c5638798eb6b511e6f49af""

2) Now

    GET http://remotesite.com?query=b58996

3) The server responds with all hashes that exist in it's database that begin with the same N bits:

    {
    ""b58996afe904bc7a211598ff2a9200fe""
    ""b58996c504c5638798eb6b511e6f49af""
    ""b58996443fab32c087632f8992af1ecc""
    ...etc... }

4) The client side javascript compares the list of hashes returned by the server and informs the user whether or not her email address exists in the DB.
	*Since ""b58996c504c5638798eb6b511e6f49af"" is present in the server response


Now

What does Reddit think of this solution? Importantly

I will spare you the personal details of why I have decided to learn to program since I'm assuming that if you are reading this


Anyways, I can figure out the assignment and write up something that will accomplish what was requested, but it probably isn't the neatest or most efficient solution. I can't ask the teacher (one of the perks of actually going to college), and I don't even have any classmates that I can talk to. So how do I go about getting input on the things I create, even if from just one or two people slightly more knowledgeable than myself? Well, that's what I am going for here. With each assignment, I will make a new post with respective links so that others may post solutions and give feedback. I have already done the first three, let me know where this should go if here is not the correct place.

**TL;DR:** For those of us too poor to afford the luxury of a teacher/classmates

If you do have a WebGL enabled browser you can check out the [live demo](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~bpd9116/WebGLU/examples/texture/reddit.html) If you want to mess around with it yourself just drop the below code into an HTML file.

The Khronos wiki has [instructions](http://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Getting_a_WebGL_Implementation) for getting a WebGL enabled browser.

For those unable to get a WebGL enabled browser

This demo uses my own [WebGLU](http://github.com/onegeek/webglu) library for working with [WebGL](http://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Main_Page). (My poster submission to SIGGRAPH of this library was accepted a few days ago w00t!) I've got some (mediocre) [documentaton](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~bpd9116/WebGLU/doc/) up as well as some [examples](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~bpd9116/WebGLU/examples/ ""Just view source on each demo page"")  

 The [fragment](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~bpd9116/WebGLU/shaders/texphong.frag) and [vertex](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~bpd9116/WebGLU/shaders/texphong.vert) shaders used in the demo are also available if you want to poke at them.

`$W` is used to access WebGLU within the script.

Also: if you know about this kind of problem already

------------

I have an array of elements (""cells"") that each have differing widths, is 140 in that picture). The order of the cells isn't important, and I'd like to rearrange the cells such that as many rows as possible are close to or equal to the width of the container.


Each time a cell is placed next to another cell, the row itself would be 42 pixels wide.


**My goal is to maximize the number of rows generated that are equal to or close to (let's say


What would be the best way to rearrange the cells to maximize the number of ""complete"" rows? Having cells left over that don't fit perfectly into a row is fine


---------

The first idea that came to mind was

1. Find the largest cell
2. Identify the largest cell that is under that maximum width
3. Repeat until no more cells can be added to the row. Create a row from these cells

Associated with each permutation of N is a special sequence of positive integers of length N called its inversion sequence. The ith element of this sequence is the number of numbers j that are strictly less than i and appear to the right of i in this permutation. For the permutation

    2  4  5  1  7  6  3  8 

the inversion sequence is

    0  1  0  2  2  1  2  0 

The 2nd element is 1 because 1 is strictly less than 2 and it appears to the right of 2 in this permutation. Similarly

As another example

    8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1 

is

    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 

In this problem

An algorithm that runs in quadratic time of the number of elements in the inversion sequence can be easily found. But I think it is possible to do better

1. The logo and rollovers are big on the splash page.  When you click a link, then that gets replaced by smaller versions of the original.  A little bit of a pain to add a new link, but i think its pretty click.

2. I use the URL hash/setInterval trick to use the hash for something other than anchors.

3.  The Map needed to be loaded only when the map tab was first visible, but only once.

4.  I use the onImagesLoad jQuery plugin to make sure all the images are loaded before the initial fade in.

Either way I decided to keep it because the people who originally wrote it were crazy. Like we gave them more work (against my request) and they decided to flip the location of properties and functions in a class crazy (TortoiseSVN loved that one for the merge).

Anyway I ran into an issue where every time I saved one file it would auto format and then give me an error at compile time. The error was:

&gt;Error 27 Unexpected NONE in parse rule ElementBody ::= ATTRIBUTE* ( PropertyElement | Content )* . ENDTAG..

Some of you might be aware of this issue in Silverlight. The error gives you a file and project name but no line number or anything to narrow down the cause. A quick google search found me some help

I went through the resource dictionary and fixed all the instances I could find. Hit save... and smacked my forehead. The reason why the formatter was causing the problem was because it was taking tags that looked like this &lt;Border&gt;&lt;/Border&gt; and converting it straight to &lt;Border /&gt;.

This is a problem I’ve run into while working on a fractal-generating program

    2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1  
    1 4 1 3 1 4 1 3  
    2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1

    2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1  
    1 3 1 5 1 3 1 8  

To make the pattern clearer
    
      1   1   1   1       2   2   2   2
    1   1   1   1                                 3       3         4       4
      1   1   1   1       2   2   2   2
    1   1   1   1                             3       3
      1   1   1   1       2   2   2   2
    1   1   1   1                                 3       3         4       4
      1   1   1   1       2   2   2   2
    1   1   1   1                             3       3

Basically, if that clarifies things.)

**Edit:** I should add that I don’t actually want to create an array filled with these values—I just want a function that returns a single value for an arbitrary set of coordinates. Also


So far I’ve come up with this function:  

    2+2*log2(x-(x&amp;(x-1)))

which returns the *maximum* value in a given row or column (2, 6, 2, 4, 2, 8, etc...). It appears that the final values can be determined solely from these row and column maxima

         2 4 6 8 10
       +-----------
     2 | 2 1 1 1 1
     4 | 1 4 3 3 3
     6 | 1 3 6 5 5
     8 | 1 3 5 8 7
    10 | 1 3 5 7 10

So the problem can be reduced to finding a function to predict *that* result.

**Edit:** It looks like this (pseudocode) works:

    mx = 2+2*log2(x-(x&amp;(x-1)))
    my = 2+2*log2(y-(y&amp;(y-1)))
    if mx == my:
        return mx
    else:
        return min(mx-1

Is that the best approach,False,,t5_2rb2y,1337484518.0,,,t3_tu25r

&gt; I wish people would stop using the term ""Rockstar"" in reference to programmers. For a start
&gt; 
&gt; Secondly, for others it's the skewed productivity rate.
&gt; 
&gt; Use a real term
&gt; 
&gt; Each of these are different skills, others are good because they obsess about producing code that is crystal clear - that also comes at a price.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes being aware of your limitations and not going for the cool toys just because they're cool is a fine thing, and the time after that, she will never be comfortable with PostgreSQL until someone makes her use it against her better ""judgement"".
&gt; 
&gt; Stop trying to find some kind of magic personality attribute that indicates a great coder. You have all the information you need
&gt; 
&gt; Just go find what they've done before, if great programmers really are tens, hundreds or even thousands of times more effective than merely average, they will so visibly stand out that you cannot possibly mistake them for anything but.
&gt; 
&gt; If you're not absolutely convinced the person you're hiring is an utter wizard
&gt; 
&gt; That's not always a bad thing. Regular coders can code too

Here is the mentioned article:

http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2011/the-number-one-trait-of-a-great-developer/

1291677852.0,ehaw2,HTML over bittorrent. What are your thoughts on the idea?,GoldenBoar,48,34,54,"Each torrent file has a unique 20-byte hash

A minimal single file info dictionary has the following keys:

* length: length of the file in bytes (integer)
* name: the filename. This is purely advisory. (string)
* piece length: number of bytes in each piece (integer)
* pieces: string consisting of the concatenation of all 20-byte SHA1 hash values


A minimal multi file info dictionary has the following keys:

* files: a list of dictionaries
* name: the filename of the directory in which to store all the files. This is purely advisory. (string)
* piece length: number of bytes in each piece (integer)
* pieces: string consisting of the concatenation of all 20-byte SHA1 hash values

Each dictionary in the files list contains the following keys:

* length: length of the file in bytes (integer)
* path: a list containing one or more string elements that together represent the path and filename. Each element in the list corresponds to either a directory name or (in the case of the final element) the filename. For example, and ""file.ext"". This is encoded as a bencoded list of strings such as l4:dir14:dir28:file.exte 


A file or set of files can be downloaded by querying a tracker or the DHT about its info hash.


By combining a web browser with a bitorrent client we could request an info hash which would download a specific static web page. In the case of multi file torrents

For example

htob:&lt;info hash&gt;

into the address bar

It's trivial to distribute and display html over bittorrent for static websites

We can do this by using a history list (which is a list of lists) to keep a record of the info hash for the original versions and any updated versions of the page. Each list within the history list would therefore represent the history of that page

For example

htob:&lt;info hash&gt;?current

which would obtain the current version of the page by querying the history list to find that page's history

The specific subgoal is to be able to combine and play different prerecorded sounds initiated by button presses.  I've gotten that part to work

General question:

* Do you guys know of any online reference of DSP terminology and approaches? E.g. envelopes, how to add sounds while retaining quality, noise elimination. I am aware that there are analog approaches to most of these, but since I have to apply them to individual samples before combining them, I need to do it digitally.  I'm currently working in a vacuum, unfortunately, and have been unable to find good references on the googles. 

* More specifically

Specific questions:

* How would you create a combined sound out of several (less than 6) sound sources?  The way I'm approaching it now is by simply adding the concurrent 12-bit samples into a 15-bit result and then putting the top 12 bits of the result out. This ""works""

* How would you synthesize authentic-sounding drum noises? Originally, loop it, and apply an envelope to alter the volume to represent a hit.  Experimenting with this in MATLAB has not gotten me good results, instead sounding robotic and not at all like a drum. Any ideas?

Thanks!

1333519195.0,rsi16,Advice on creating a Virtual Printer (and other stuff),TheShoosh,3,3,2,"OK

A brief summary of what we're hoping to achieve:

* A user 'prints' a document from *[Insert application here]* to our virtual printer. 

* This virtual printer will be able to convert the data being received back into real text (as far as I'm aware, font details etc. Reason being...

* Once the document is back into a text file of some kind, and say ""this selected region here is _____"". An example would be printing an invoice, and selecting the company's name on the invoice.

There's a little more that we'd do after this, so that any future invoice printed could programmatically attain the text of each region, without requiring human interaction.

NOW... As our knowledge of writing print drivers is rather lacking

So far I've found [this software](http://www.blackice.com) which supposedly has [a form reconstruction tool](http://www.blackice.com/PDRTKFormRebuild.htm). It looks promising

I'm a little lost right now as to what approach we should be taking. So far all other virtual printer drivers will produce an EMF file, font info and stuff that we could use to help with selecting regions. Unfortunately their demo software was missing this particular tool, and when I inquired about it I was pretty much given the cold shoulder.

My understanding was that there is only one thread of execution

In most cases it seems like that's the case

I've bound a function to the 'touchmove' event on the document body.  This function does the following:

1. Records the coordinates of the event
2. Creates and appends an element to the document
3. Adds the element and coords onto a list
4. Schedules the timeout (if it hasn't been scheduled already)

The timeout function itself performs a series of DOM manipulations which were causing the main thread to lag

The background task seems to be doing something that is causing it to 'yield' to the main thread, I get a log that looks something like this:

I was asked to do a project that could save the company a lot of time. The task pretty much comes down to grabbing data from various places and putting it in a better format. I had nearly finished the program in C before I realized that it's run through the command prompt with command line arguments and I can't ask my coworkers to use it like that. I started looking at using the Windows API

Is there any way someone could write me a UI I can wrap my program in? It just needs a few fields to enter some strings that my program will use once a button is hit to start it and if possible include a field to browse for a file and a field to browse for a folder.

Thanks in advance or anyway",,t5_2rb2y,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/kfvus/i_may_have_bit_off_more_than_i_can_chew_can/

If you represent a rectangle by the position of its left, and bottom edges, there are two ways to interpret that when considering what pixels are inside it (for all operations, filling, clipping, even outlining, and so on).

One way is to fill all pixels from left to right and top to bottom inclusive.

The other way fills pixels &gt;= left and &lt; right and &gt;= top and &lt; bottom.

I've observed that even though excluding the right and bottom edges is the less obvious and more intuitively weird way, it seems to be the only sensible way to do it, because consider a larger unit, like inches on a ruler:

    0        1        2        3        4        5
    |--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|

A rectangle with left=1 and right=4 fills 3 inches of width this way. If you included the right edge it would extend up to the 5-inch mark.

I'm just rambling really

Does anyone have any opinions on the merits of the different styles?",,t5_2rb2y,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/kbl0s/rectangles_in_graphics_apis/

* The script creates the smallest set of rules for turning all the correct 1s on.

* If the script was run it would allocate a block of memory on your disk equal to the number of bits the original scanned file had

* You could then share this compact set of rules with people over the internet to transfer large files in a really compressed way.
