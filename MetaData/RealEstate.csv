Thanks for the great response. I figured you guys might like an update. The two main suggestions were to sue the estate or leave it alone and forgo rent.

* **Taxable value** is based on assessed value, but this is not always the case.* As you can guess, your property tax or ""millage"" (that's tax per $1000) is based on this amount. Search ""[your state] taxable value"" for more information.

* **Market value** is [defined](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value) as ""the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s-length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, what a buyer and seller agree is a fair price. It has absolutely nothing to do with assessed value, taxable value, or Zestimates. 

* **Appraised value** is what a licensed appraiser establishes a property is worth. *This is often but not always* for purposes of a lender justifying a mortgage amount. *If it is based on another metric, however there are a set of formulae that appraisers use to make all things relatively equal.

1352836775.0,13505k,How to Get Rid of Bed Bugs Cheaply (From a Landlord),REInvestor,53,7,21,"Before we begin

I tried a number of consumer sprays, but my tenants were still getting bit. I am also supremely cheap so paying $600+ PER apartment for a pro to do it is just not an option. They were quoting $150+ per spraying and they needed at least three treatments. Or the heat treatment would be about $800+ but be one time. You bet your ass I'm gonna see if I can DIY it before spending that kinda cash.

When I started using the method detailed below

###Here's what you do:

1. The tenant needs to keep their apartment clean and tidy. Makes it easier to spray. They should wash their sheets and clothes regularly and clean/vacuum regularly.

2. Buy Gentrol insect growth regulator ($80). It keeps the larvae for becoming adults. Once the eggs hatch

3. Buy Temprid SC ($90). This is the pesticide which will linger and kill the actual adult bugs. There are some other good pesticides which work well too

4. Another good thing

5. You can buy a lot of this stuff on Amazon in concentrated form

5. Mix the proper amounts of Gentrol and Temprid (it's about 1oz each per gallon of water IIRC) into a pump-sprayer ($20) and shake it up then you spray the fucking shit out of the apartment. Not just around baseboards, couches, and pillows, tables, door hinges, etc. **Every-fucking-where.**

6. I would recommend wearing a ventilator while you do this and follow all safety protocols on the bottle. Once the stuff is dry

8. Do the treatment again two weeks later and then two weeks after that. After that, albeit less vigorously just to be safe.

Your total start-up cost is about the cost of one pro treatment and you'll be able to treat probably 15-20 apartments with your first bottles of chemicals. It takes me maybe 10 minutes to treat an apartment and the tenant needs to be out of there for a few hours IMO for the stuff to dry.

1367369272.0,1dg7wa,I've seen a few people coming through lately asking what they can do to help get their business off the ground as agents. Here's what I know:,slidellian,47,10,25,"I've posted this previously

I’ve been asked by a few Redditors to comment further on ‘lead generating’, if not more so, than my listing appointments. The reason is that without lead gen time, I will have no listings, and, “He who lists, lasts.” It’s that simple.

So what is lead generating? Lead generating is the process of contacting people to try and get new business going. It can mean contacting people that are either in your database currently, expired listings (those that were listed, and the listing period ended with resulting in a sale), calling on people in your database and asking who they know that is thinking about buying, selling, or investing that you can call, going to garage sales and talking to the owners, mainly because there just aren’t that many leads that fall into brokerage’s laps. There are plenty of people that want to buy and sell; you just have to be able to find them on your own.

One more very bold way of lead generating is (get ready for this one) calling the agent who has the expired listing and offering them a 26.2% referral fee if they’ll send that seller over to you. Many listings that expire can become much harder to work on, you want to really capture their attention to keep them from rejecting you and not listening. When you say 26.2, they’ll silently wonder why.

When calling expired listings, but it just didn’t sell for some reason the first time they had it on the market. You have to call them and see when they plan to hire the right agent for the job to sell their house. Make an appointment with them where you can just take 15 minutes of their time to show them what you do to get houses sold. At that point, you can get in the door and get the listing. The second thing to remember (and you really need to tell yourself this over and over before you start calling) is “They’re home, they’re happy, and they want me to call.” It’s true. And if you don’t call, your competition will. Who do you want to have the listing? You, or your competition?

FSBOs are also a great source of leads. Many FSBOs are willing to pay a buyer’s agent a commission to bring a buyer; they just don’t want to pay a listing agent and a buyer’s agent. If you can convince them to pay just a little bit more commission to hire you, because they may be able to use some of your techniques to help themselves. “I could come by tonight at 3, or would 6 be better?”

FSBOs want to sell, you can refer them to another agent.

When calling people to add to your database

The Yellow Pages are another great source of leads. Open the YP and find a few businesses. Call them, and you’d like to stop by and meet them face to face. At that point, you can get their business cards, and give them a few of yours. Chances are good that someone in the business will have some real estate need, or they know someone who does.

So what’s all this about putting your leads into a database? You do this because for every 12 people you have in your MET database (that’s people you’ve met face to face at least once) you can expect at least one transaction per year. 144 contacts should work out to 12 transactions. For every 50 people you have in your UNMET database (this is people who you have in your database for when you do mail outs to a subdivision or people who you are friends with on Facebook, in a rotation of email, phone call, personal visit, post card in the mail, and otherwise. You want to convert your unmet people to mets, so get our and meet folks. You want to keep in front of all of these people so that when they think real estate, when you think of beer

1375302824.0,1jg1zh,What Happens at the Foreclosure Auction.,ShortWoman,38,4,23,"This morning

There were 2291 trustee sales scheduled last month

* Short sale was completed

* Bankruptcy court intervened

* Deed in lieu of foreclosure was completed

* A miracle happened

* The owner came up with all the money owed to the bank

* The bank realized they were missing paperwork

So that leaves **only 26% of scheduled foreclosure auctions actually happening**. Because we have a lot of active investor action at these sales currently

If you decide to buy at these auctions remember these facts:

* You'll need cash. A stack of money orders works best. 

* You might not be buying the property free and clear

* You won't have the opportunity to tour the property before hand beyond maybe looking in a window.

* It's up to you to know what comparable properties are ""worth"" before you go.

* There's a good chance that the property you were interested in won't actually sell that day.

* There's a lot of savvy investors there who know the system better than you.

1348444090.0,10d5xy,UPDATE on real estate agent asking for compensation even though no contract was involved,accordin2121,38,1,15,"Hey guys
    I was asked by people [in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/z2d1n/real_estate_agent_asking_for_compensation_even/) to make an update.

So what happened was that this real estate agent was asking me for compensation even though I DID not sign a contract nor was I told of any obligations. 

The person was threatening me to pay otherwise he would send me to court

I asked a lot of people around me and including this subreddit for advice and everybody said he was talking nonsense. My cousin had a friend in the business and he told me straight up to contact the managing broker and tell him everything keep it short and to the point.

So finally I contacted the managing broker and he was quite shocked that this particular agent was asking for 300$ and he promised me that the agent will stop threatening me and he will personally look into this matter.

So It has been a week and no letters or anything. So I just want to tell new home buyers that if you receive such threats or anything from Real Estate agents who ask you for compensation without a contract always refuse and ignore them. You are not obligated to pay any agents what so ever if you are the buyer.

I'm looking to compose a very concise list for prospective buyers; most amount of info in the shortest sentences. It's a starting point for new buyers

These are the expectations one should know before one even thinks about owning rental properties. 

PLEASE HELP ADD
Here are a few to get started. 

* 2.5% goes to agent each time you buy or sell. Take that into your account when calculating ROI. 

* You can't just rent anything. Rent has to be within the local price range to have good demand. Renters tend to be poorer people. 

* Usually experienced rental property owners own a couple properties. 

* You can leverage your money

* You likely won't qualify for a loan as a first time buyer unless you already have steady income

* The loan terms won't be as favorable as what you get for your own primary residence. Commercial property loans are different. 

* Cash flow and appreciation potential are inversely related

* Rent should be no less than 1% of value per month if you're looking for cash flow. 

* Coastal properties bring in less rental ratio

* Property management can do almost all the management. Expect about 10% fee. 

* Expect about 10% vacancy. 

* Don't forget about property tax of HOA dues. % vary. 

* Dont' forget your rental income is taxed as normal income

* When you sell the house

* Bad tenents can happen, not including potential damage. 

* You will be competing against pros and many amateurs. Foreclosure auctions aren't as easy to make money as they make it to be on infomercials. 


There's plenty more about location section, etc. But I'm not sure how to put them in a sentence. These are pretty vague guidelines, don't be too picky about particulars.

He is moving to a retirement community and had been procrastinating on selling the place. Neither he nor I have real-estate agent representation. I had the simple sales contract drawn up by a local attorney. I jumped at the opportunity for obvious reasons. He also actually told us that the very low price was the maximum that he would sell it for. He dismissed the notion that it was actually worth more when I suggested it to him. He's a humble man. Ultimately

However, perhaps his motivations are just different - not dollar driven. 

Now

Should I give him the opportunity to break the contract and negotiate the price UPWARD? Or is ignorance bliss? If he's happy and we're happy has any wrong been done? 

What's the right way to show this man the respect he deserves?

Edit: I spoke with the seller about the possibility of the home being appraised for much more than the selling price. He said he'd rather not know what the final appraised value is and reaffirmed that he is happy selling at the agreed upon price. He made it clear that he knows roughly what it will appraise for.

Is there any way to sufficiently minimize/mitigate the risk of renting to someone with a pit-bull or other dog often categorized as a ""vicious breed""?

My thoughts:  
* Require the tenant to have renter's insurance that specifically covers dog bites.  
* Get a letter from the tenant that affirms that the dog has never injured or attacked anyone.  
* Write into the lease that the dog must be confined to the property or leashed at all times. Also

Is this actually valid?,Pyro919,32,8,25,"Our direct upstairs neighbor has grandkids that she has over a few times a month.   Every time they visit they run around

I decided to try to contact them directly to resolve the issue since if my family was bothering the neighbors I would rather have them talk with me than involve management. 

I've contacted them on 3 separate occasions.   The first time was at 7 am (during our complex's quiet hours) and while I was speaking with her one of her grandkids kicked me.   

The last time we contacted them my wife went by herself since I'm a rather large and can be intimidating to some people. We thought my wife would be less threatening and maybe the upstairs neighbor would be more receptive to her.   When my wife went to speak with her, I made one of his kids cry. My wife apologized saying that my stature can be intimidating to a child, but the tenant said the little girl hadn't ever seen me (even though it was the child that had come out and kicked me.) She was told to talk to management since they weren't going to do a damn thing about the noise.

Since then we've written formal complaints to management on 3 separate occasions. We recently (almost a month after the incident with my wife) received a letter in the mail from the management company stating:

*Dear Tenant(s)*

*XYZ Management Company has received complaints that you have been harassing the upstairs neighbors regarding noise.   Please be aware that if we receive one more complaint

*If you continue to incur noise problems with the upstairs neighbors

*As you realize when living in an apartment complex

*If you have any questions regarding the rules

*Account Supervisor*  
*XYZ Management Company*

I've checked the rental agreement twice and had my wife check it too. No where in the rental agreement, and plan on contacting him as well as his supervisor at the management company next time we have an issue, but really part of the problem stems from the fact that they don't have any set office hours.

I live in Texas and last year I wound up short-selling because our own realtor screwed us over; he submitted an offer to us, and buyer's broker, for more than 30% off of our asking price. We were going through a divorce and we were fast approaching the last payment I would be able to make (the ex-wife moved out and refused to make payments). He told us, in writing via email, that ""we shouldn't worry about the contract price"" because he had no intention of buying this propery, it was just a ruse to put off any action by the bank and find out the lowest amount the bank would accept for the property. When I objected to this, he tried to tell me that he'd only seek to enforce the contract if the bank came back with a reasonable counter (""Uh

At this point, he produced a legitimate buyer -- but (a) we'd missed a payment and were about to miss another, and (b) he was about 10k below what we owed.

We accepted the contract. Then, and such. I objected to this as well, so he terminated the buyer's contract and his representation of us _without any discussion._ Literally, the exchange went like this:

Him: We're only submitting your wife's income statements to the bank and hoping that they'll just assume it's a complete file.
Me: Uh
Him: I'm terminating our representation of you.

So, recontacted the buyer, and managed to close the deal, only barely Short (by about 10k), and in default because of all these shenanigans.

My lender, etc.  

Sure - here it goes.

If you are looking to refi or buy a new home **AVOID THESE FUCKERS LIKE THE PLAGUE**.

We had been looking for a home for over two years.  During that time I spoke with a number of different lenders from Quicken all the way down to some mom &amp; pop lenders.  Somewhere along the way I spoke to Discover and was told about a program that they had where I could avoid having to pay any PMI (private mortgage insurance) which was quite appealing since removing PMI put us into a price range where we could actually afford something (we live in Southern California).

I recall asking the mortgage banker if this was something that was unique to DHL and was assured that it was.

THAT was my mistake - believing them.  Total bullshit, that was my fault for listening and believing.

So - when we FINALLY got an offer accepted

At first

We reached a point where we needed to remove our loan contingency and in order to do that we needed a final approval letter from Discover.  I will spare you all the details but what I was told was going to take a day or two actually ended up taking a week or two and we nearly lost the deal because the seller was threatening to pull out since we would not remove the contingencies because Discover kept giving us conditional approval letters with a list of conditions that we satisfied with their underwritting WEEKS prior.

The worst part about it was how our Mortgage Banker (our primary contact) would not call me back for days at a time despite my repeated calls and emails.  On top of that - whenever I would call and try and get any manager on the line they would never answer their phones nor would they ever call me back.

The worst part came when they sent me a revised Good Faith Estimate that suddenly had my closing costs $8, it's expensive in California""  When I demanded to speak to his manager - he gave me her number and told me to call her.

Seriously?

I could go on and tell you about how his manager later said that I was trying to extort them but I will spare the details.

**Home Purchasing Process: Best Practices**

Getting fiscally ready


     1. Should you buy or rent (Buy/Rent Calculator)

* http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/business/buy-rent-calculator.html

     2. If you still want to buy

     3. Save for a 20% down payment

* If this is your first home consider putting money (up to $10

* More about IRA's here. http://www.fool.com/money/allaboutiras/allaboutiras12.htm


     4. Check your credit score annually and submit corrections

     5. Visit a credit union or bank and get prequalified

     6. Ensure that monthly payments are under 30% of your monthly income 

     7. Ensure you have enough to cover closing costs


The search begins


     1. Check FHA for government lending programs

* www.fha.gov

     2. Find a mortgage broker to get the best rate on a mortgage

     3. Find a Realtor

* At some point your Realtor will have you sign an agreement saying you won't buy a house with another Realtor within some amount of time (90 days seems common)

     4. Find a few good options


Research


     1. Look up a crime and sexual offender map (e.g.

     2. Talking to the neighbors

     3. Call utility companies to get the last year's average

     4. Review the seller's disclosure statement (This is a form that a seller must give a buyer


Buying a house

     1. Make an offer pending home inspection

* Ask your Realtor to look for comparables (similar houses that have sold recently) before making an offer

* You can ask for closing costs

* You can also ask for inclusions (e.g., any repairs needed found during home inspection)

* Note: You need to provide earnest money (typically ~1% of offer) when making an offer. You could lose this if you back out for a reason other than those allowed in the contract

     2. Seller presents counter offer

     3. If you accept

* http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/housing/sfh/insp/inspfaq

     4. Consider other inspections (Radon, asbestos, termites, lead) Your inspector may notice some of these things, but a specialist will know more

     5. Subtract expenses/repairs from your original offer

     6. Create a purchasing agreement and present it to the seller

     7. Do a final walkthrough (Ensure the property is in the condition you agreed to buy)

* http://homebuying.about.com/od/homeshopping/qt/Walkthrough.htm

     8. Settlement


Yay you have a home!

     1. Get homeowner's insurance

* Consider flood and earthquake insurance

     2. Change locks after moving in

**Lead with revenue.** By this, print ads, etc.). Don't go finance a new car so you look sharp. ONLY spend the money you have. I've been in real estate for a while, and all of the agents I've spoken to who started their career by taking out a loan or charging everything on a credit card said they later regretted it. This is mostly because you will end up having to make payments on all of this, and if you are having a slow month and can't make your payments, that's really bad. It's bad for your credit, but it's also bad for your business. You never want to be known as the guy who borrowed money he can't pay back.
If you want a new car

Let's see, or may take longer. I did not have six months of expenses set aside when I started, and I really regretted it.

**Contact management.** Use some sort of contact management software. I know some companies have one they provide. USE IT RELIGIOUSLY. You will see more clients fall to the wayside and go buy or sell with someone else because you lost contact with them.

**Lead Generate.** You should be lead generating every single day. What’s more important than going on appointments to take listings? Lead generating. The reason is that without lead generating, I keep going. If you make your contacts every day, you won’t fail in the business. 

**Set Your Goals.* Have them on paper. Post them where you and your family can see them. My goals are posted in my office, you will achieve them.*

**Be Accountable.** Probably 99% of Realtors are “independent contractors”, you want to. And you do, TRUST ME. When you are accountable to someone else, you are more likely to achieve your goals. The person you are accountable to can be another Realtor, and they can also be accountable to you. I report to my accountability partner daily and tell him what I’ve achieved and what I haven’t, and if I’m not living up to my goals (or he isn’t living up to his), we grill one another about it and get to the root of the issue to see what obstacle is keeping us from being as productive as possible. 

**Schedule.** You need to have a schedule

**Role Play.** I have a role play partner who is also a Realtor. He and I go through various scripts and scenarios

**Have a Lawyer Contact.** Lawyers are expensive. They can also be very valuable to your business in helping you avoid litigation. Make contact with a lawyer, notary work, etc. 

**Full time.** When you get into the business, do us a favor, and don't do it at all. The agents who tend to get into trouble the most, and the ones who give other Realtors a bad name tend to be the part timers who have another job as their main source of income. This is because they never fully learn all the ropes and how to handle the business and they can be really hard to get a hold of when it comes time to doing a contract. Also, if you jump into it fully committed, you will do yourself a tremendous favor, because your business will prosper as well.

**Talk to people.** Tell everyone you know that you are in real estate. Don't be afraid to ask for business, or say, ""Hi, I'm sorry, I just overheard you talking about real estate. My name is Slidellian, it's nice to meet you! I'm a Realtor, were you thinking about looking for some property?"" or something along those lines. True story: I was getting a haircut a couple of years ago, ""Is he working with an agent? (no.) Great, and he called me the next morning. We looked at two properties

**Know Thy Neighborhood.** Get to know the inventory you have in your area. When you first start out, but make sure you go see the houses. The whole idea is two-fold: One, you get to see the inventory, and two, you start seeing what kind of house different amounts of money buy in different areas.

**Read** Gary Keller is the Chairman of Keller Williams Realty, it's written by a KW guy, but I know lots of agents at other companies who have read this book. It talks about building your business from the ground up, and how to be successful while doing it. In all honesty, it doesn't matter if you're starting up donut shop, or a real estate business, this is a great book. If you are really serious about this business, let me know and I will mail you a copy.

*Testimonials* Right after you close a deal

**Be Fair To Yourself.** You won't work with sellers and take a listing without using a listing agreement. I highly recommend that you don't work with buyers without using a buyer-agency agreement. I use one with every buyer I work with. If they won't sign it, they admitted that they had been working with other agents already, despite earlier telling me they had not. Also, if you ever go to arbitration with another agent who claims that you stole their client, chances are good that the people who sit on the board will ask you if you had you Agency Disclosure signed, and also if you had any type of Buyer-Agency agreement. The other agent may not have had the buyer sign either one, so when you show up and can produce both

**Mindset.** Your mindset might be the single most important part of your *life.* It determines your successes and failures, and nobody is selling or buying, and it’s impossible to make a living in this business, you’re right. If you think that people don’t want to be bothered by talking to Realtors, you’re right, *they don’t want to be bothered by a Realtor with a sucky mindset.* I’m not saying you should be unrealistic. I’m saying you have to have the highest opinions of yourself, and you have to have a positive outlook on everything you do. 

I hope all of this helps! If you have other questions

Be well

I've been hearing about my parents' struggle to sell their house for years and I really want to do what I can to help. They made the mistake of buying a herrgård (it's basically a Swedish manor house, they ended up owning two large houses in the middle of nowhere in Sweden (Värmland, good holiday location, but very isolated). Financially, it's a massive burden for them. They're not particularly well off and two large houses that are that old cost a lot to maintain. So far, they've split the smaller house into two flats and are renting one out and living in the other, meaning they can shut down the larger house during winter to save on heating costs. That house, but they really can't charge enough to cover maintenance. I know they've also been trying to split the property in two so that they can focus on selling the larger house

They've had maybe four interested buyers since they put the house on the market about five years ago, and think ""That's what I want.""

Two issues I think of straight away: Cultural issues and presentation. The cultural issues are that, when we first visited before my parents bought it, there were clothes lying on beds, the beds weren't made, there were toys everywhere and nobody seemed to think that was weird. Certainly in the UK, that's not normal. You make the room look like nobody lives there, in a way that makes people think they might want to. Basically, but no Swedes have ever been interested in buying it. As for the presentation... Well, that made the place look more like it's price. My parents just have normal furniture

Anyway, please pass them along. I know basically nothing about selling houses, and I'm sure Reddit has some ideas that my parents haven't even considered yet.

I'd link their website to make this post make more sense

Edit: Thanks for the advice, but it's not something I can influence particularly. Also, some people are saying it's overpriced, others are saying it's reasonably priced, some people are implying it's under priced, so although I think they should lower the price to encourage interest, I'm not really sure what's accurate.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1e2gdi/advice_for_my_parents_who_have_been_trying_to/

I also know that there have been laws that were tightened as a result of the recession. And what they do now is different from what they used to do?

What I want to know is:

1. Do they know the contract price of the house? Do they use that or the list price? (Legally or practically?)

2. Are the ""listing"" comps actually used or there just for information?

3. What is done when there are no comparable houses (either within the given time or alike enough properties)?

Here's one to kick you off. I had a super-ghetto applicant for a nice apartment in a middle class area. First she called to set up the viewing and kept breaking off to scream at people in the background

By the time she turned up she was an hour late and had called me 4 times for directions (which I'd already given on the phone and were in the ad). She was wearing a sparkly gold boob tube and a fake-leather skirt. She took a cursory glance around the apartment, and said ""I work in a strip club. Is that ok?"" I almost said no but the phrase ""lawful source of income"" suddenly ran through my mind and I had a vision of trying to explain to a judge why I was discriminating in violation of federal law. So I said yes, at which point she told me that she always paid the rent on time but sometimes she brought her work home with her. At this point I had to control myself from busting out laughing.

Luckily I never got an application from her so I never had to find a reason to reject her. I still don't know whether she was a hired actress from Fair Housing who was playing an offensive sterotype to gauge my reaction

I'm still not sure whether I'd rather have her or another tenant I inherited when I bought that same building. This one was very pleasant when sober, asking them to go and buy booze for her since she'd been banned from every liquor store in the area. Rumor had it that she would also regularly trade sexual favors with random strangers in return for drugs or liquor. The previous owners, apparently also being insane, had made her the building manager so she was responsible for collecting rent each month, when not in jail for addiction-related offenses.

In a funny way I'm grateful to this lady and the other bums in the building -- if they had been better tenants I wouldn't have been able to pick the place up for a good price

We have been married for almost 9 years now (we are 27 and 28). The first 4 years of our marriage I was in college, but instead we took over a number of their monthly bills to share costs. But, it was definitely much cheaper for us, and we are now debt free (no school loans, no credit card debt, and we own both of our cars outright)!

I didn't want to buy a house until we had gotten rid of our debt

I am currently only making 42.5k per year, we decided to look for houses in the 70-85k range, though we were really trying to stay in the lower end of that range to keep monthly costs down. We ended up finding an amazing house listed for 74,900, and we jumped on it! It has 3 bedrooms, 1 bath, and is 1350 square feet.

And, appliances, counter-tops, etc... The bathroom was also remodeled in 2010 with new tile, shower, jet tub, and sink. The furnace, and hot-water heater are all new as of 2011. There is an above ground pool with new pool liner, and another playground for the kids. It really is perfect for us

Then,000 (instead of the 74,900 it was listed for that we had originally offered). We were amazed that the sellers agreed to sell it to us for 67k as well as give us 1500 towards closing costs (we had originally asked for 3k, but once the appraisal came in lower, they asked if we could split that amount in half, and we were happy to)! We are very grateful to them for all of this!!!

Also, a number of credits cards, etc... over the past 4 years without a single late payment, we both have over 770 credit scores. This allowed us to secure a 3.875% fixed interest rate for 30 years on the mortgage.

All this adds up to an amazing deal for us!!

1) I can find listings online. My realtor just automates the MLS search and waits for me to contact him about any that I like. This can also be done online.

2) I can directly call the listing agents from the website. I have to wait for my realtor to call the listing agent. I also may have to coordinate with my realtor to be able to see the property. Seems like an unnecessary middle man when dealing with hot properties. 

3) I have a proper contact found on realtor websites or drafted by my lawyer to be able to put my bid in

4) I have inspectors and lawyers during the review process. The realtor does nothing during this anyways.

5) During closing

Again, but with the advent of the internet, I don't see the use of realtors besides someone that has access to the MLS database. The only reason that I have kept mine thus far is that listing agents have informed me that they are getting the full commission from the seller regardless, so I won't be ""saving"" that extra percentage.


**edit:** Thanks for all of the replies everyone. I've come to the conclusion that realtors are only as good as their experience. Those realtors that are doing their due diligence, I would imagine that 75%+ of all realtors do not do enough of the work that is warranted with a client. Those of you that go the extra mile to perform, should and most likely will be rewarded with repeat clients. What I still stand by however is that the real estate industry is a monopoly. People like me cannot take the extra risk and time needed to battle the seller's agent alone and be rewarded monetarily for my effort. If I want to represent myself in court, I can. If I want to fix my own car, I can. If I want to self diagnose an injury, I can (medication is a different story but that has to do with drug abuse I think). My point is that the restrictive nature of MLS as well as the practice of seller's contract with the buyers has made it so that the consumer is not benefited.

The internet has brought many buyers and sellers of goods together, and leave the option to the buyer/seller to pay for their own realtor. ",,False,,t5_2qipl,1366852220.0,,

To further confuse things, so i do not have a sales contract to go back and read. Assuming its the standard contract, my questions are:

1. Since it is not listed for sale

2. Is the listing company/agency entitled to any compensation since the home was originally viewed by the potential buyer at an open house?  Be no official offer was made

3. If they are tracking the local real estate transaction

I will compensate my buddy/realtor for his previous effort in some other fashion

Thanks for your help,False,,t5_2qipl,False,,,t3_13cw7y

I'm a new redditor
Here's the story...
My BF and I have been shopping for a house for about 5 months. We want to settle down and have a family (I'm 32 and he's 29). There was this house that came available on the Fannie Mae Homepath program about 4 months ago and we checked it out
Here's were it get's...odd.
So we wait to hear a response in the first few days and we check the website with our Realtor to see if the listing agent submitted our offer to Fannie Mae. Nope
Last night our Realtor informed us that he sent an email to the listing agent stating that he felt that this wasn't being handled ethically and he would report him to the board if our offer wasn't submitted.
The listing agent called back our Realtor and stated ""The bank is considering other offers and I'll report YOU to the board!"" Our Realtor asked about these ""other offers"" and the listing agent says ""None of your business!!"" and hangs up. About 30 minutes later our Realtor gets an email from the listing agent stating that ""the bank is accepting another offer and our offer has been REJECTED"". So we go to the website and as of today and our offer is still there
We love this house and we are so upset because we have given it our best shot. We think that the listing agent is holding out on the property for an investor friend and that he trying to get it cheaper that what they are asking. We are offering MORE than asking. 
We need a contact in Fannie Mae besides the call center and the clock is ticking! This listing agent will not budge and we just want our offer looked at. The property in Hollywood

r/RealEstate Help us!! :'(

**UPDATE:** 
* Both of us called Fannie Mae today and more voice mails just like a few days ago.
* I called a Lawyer and he said that he could file a Lis Pendens but it would cost $3
* The Florida DRE only takes complaints by snail mail.

I'm closing on my first home, people seem to be paying a lot less. When I questioned the lender, he explained that I'm only putting 5% down, and most importantly, I will not be paying PMI. Most loans with less than 20% down require that I pay PMI, which would more than offset that difference in interest rate to say, 3.9% (just to choose a number). 

I'm in Florida, and my credit score is over 750. 

thanks!

________________________________________________________

**EDIT (2/20 7:10PM EST):** I spoke with the broker, or 3.875% with PMI. PMI will be $140. 

The 3.875+PMI Scenario will cost me $40 more per month in the short term ($1444 vs $1480). However

Real estate prices are rising, over the course of the next 10 years, I will have paid an extra $4800, and as the saying goes, a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. Not to mention, there's the added ""hassle"" of dealing with PMI. 

So the question is now this, which is simpler, and saves me money in the shorter term. Mind you, it's unlikely that I keep this house longer than 10 years, and the area I live in is appreciating quickly.

The termite inspector did find some minor damage in another part of the house and marked as such on his report. I took a look but it was very minor.  Also the moisture content in the crawl space was borderline high.  I'm thinking this verbiage in his letter is enough to get him out of responsibility.

My only other glimmer of hope is that the previous owner was aware of the issue and never disclosed the information.

My lot is somewhat large for the area. A few lots over from mine has the same area carved up into three different lots vertically between the water and the road in a manner very similar to what I'm proposing here

There are also several rental properties in the area (some further away from the water than others)

Also we are not in a huge rush to rent out the new house or houses immediately or turn the project into an income-producing property. My wife and I come from large families and are leaning more towards using this project to build one or two guest houses for friends and family for the time being

Based on those facts

- Will I have to formally divide my property into two or three separate lots in order to build new house(s)

- What sorts of approvals will I need to get from the town and county to approve my new construction?

- How much should I expect property taxes to go up upon completion of the project? $Current + ($Current / 2) or something? Less? More?

- Likewise

- Aside from increases in property taxes, and the one-time costs of construction, are there any other new costs to consider?

- How can I legally share my driveway with the tenants?

- How can I legally share my waterfront / dock rights with the tenants?

2) Don't refinance and keep the ex on the loan; keep paying - either from renters or stay here (I want to move out of state

4) Refinance; keep paying

My ex moved out of state after we broke up and ran up a ton of debt.

This is what I gleaned that I thought you guys would love and hate:


1. Before they choose a site, and they have the local government/taxing board lower their taxes by a percentage (he mentioned 50%) based on the increased prop values/jobs/income.  So basically they get a portion of the betterment to society in the form of a property tax rebate.

2.  This store would setup a 'museum' in their store for educational purpose

The property was originally built in the mid-1920s as a large single family home, and has easy access to transit and bike trails.

The units consist of four 2-bedroom units and one 1-bedroom unit. The property also has a 2-car garage and a few other off-street parking spots in the rear of the building. Recent improvements include a new roof in 2008

The seller is asking $375, expenses total $21,000 per year, and thus the net is $32,000 per year. The cap rate is 8.5%.

The expenses are on, thus the current property owner is paying for the electric for all five units. Based on average rents in the area, it doesn’t seem that the current owner has built the electric costs into the rent. 

If the electric was separated (not sure how feasible this is), this would bring the cap rate up to 9.3%

All of the tenants have been in the property long-term

I’ve managed a 23-unit property for the last two years, I’m new to the financial aspects of property management. 

What things aren’t I considering? What should I look for when I view the property? Is what they’re asking for the property a fair price?

We (my wife and I) have been saving up for a house for a while now and have ~$18k saved up.  We are looking to get a $200-$250k house.  Income is not an issue and I prefer not to post it here.  Middle FICO score is around 660.  We are debt free except for a car loan.

A credit union I'm a member of is offering an FHA based first time home buyer program that pays for everything up front, but since I'd have to pay for closing costs, I don't think I'm there yet with my cash saved up.  The housing market is really hot here so I don't think the seller is going to help me out, either.

Is there an obvious answer between FHA or conventional for me?  I think the base interest rate on the FHA will be better since my credit isn't stellar, we'd hate to be renting for another year saving up more money and not in a house building some equity.

A few weeks ago I started considering buying a condo/loft/townhome/not ahouse due to the offer of a down payment gift from my parents and also considering the current state of housing market.   

I did my research, got preapproved, found a highly rated buyer's agent, and visited 10 places.    


Last weekend my agent and I visited a place I really liked and one I thought was a serious contender. I wanted to have my parents come visit the following weekend and hear their thoughts/get their approval.  My agent was extremely adamant about moving fast and making an offer within the next three days. I told her I didn't feel comfortable without having my parents view--they were paying the down payment

I talked to my parents and they researched the loft I was interested in and they hated it. I told my agent their thoughts

She followed up with a two page long email (srsly. two pages. single spaced. in Word) about how I should have told her earlier on that I wasn't the sole decider


I was annoyed. I felt like I was being treated like a child when all I wanted was to think about it and consider my options. I told her I wanted to explore more and she sent ANOTHER two page long email about how she had already shown me everything on the market (we visited 10 places in 6 subdivisions) that was the best investment value for my price range (160K). She then went on to say we were stepping backwards and that I should have figured out what I wanted style and location I wanted before coming to her. And she is also adamant about not showing more than 15 homes because it gets ""unproductive"" after that.    


And honestly, and feeling pressured to buy what they like vs what I like. Plus, my agent has really pushed my buttons with her emails.

1. Many of the people there probably had lines of credit. Once I realized that

2. Contrary to what I thought when I got there

3. Because its As-Is, so it was going to be a fight for the person who came away with it to even get it into their name.

4. My friend called me later saying that he heard that I went to the tax sale. He told me he used to go all the time and buy property there

1368142291.0,1e198e,Tenants moved out early...,Ct20051112,20,4,28,"Alright I'm looking for some advice. I'm in the military and own a home in California (and i live on the opposite side of the country) that I've been renting to the same tenants for a 3 year lease. They submitted a 60 day notice that they were moving out at the end of their lease on April 30th to my property management company. In the lease it states in bold letters ""Security deposit is not to be used in lieu as payment for last month's rent""

My PMC allowed them to do just this without telling me. They destroyed the carpet in the hallway

The lease also states if they terminate the agreement prior to completion of written agreement they will be responsible for ""any lost rent, and painting costs necessary to re-rent unit.""

The PMC is stating because it was around 30 days that they left early (last rent payment) that it's ok to use the security deposit for rent. This leaves me with no additional funds to go towards additional cleaning and repairs from their security deposit. They billed the tenants the amount for repairs and cleaning ($491 which would have came out of security deposit) but the tenants wrote a rebuttal claiming they cleaned the house well enough not to have to pay that amount.

My question after all of that is if I were to try and take them (previous tenants) to small claims court for the additional $491 would I also be in the right to add in the 1 month of missed rent and the entire paint cost even though they say the paint life is only 2 years?

Is it even worth the hassle of going through small claims court for the $491?

I live in Astoria NYC where the rent is $1450 for a crummy 1br.  It goes up $75 per year so in 3 years I’ll be paying $1750 for a crumby 1br. This is just unacceptable.  I’d like to move to a house, and no education/job.  If we get serious it’s only an additional burden for me.


Looking at home values in NYC – my  old neighborhood in the Bronx has 2br-homes running 200-600k. My current neighborhood has homes running 700-1.2mil.  This means at minimum I have to save 40k-140k. Currently I can save about 10-15k/yr…making the feat seem impossible.

2.) I get a job out of state and alert my landlord I need to be out by Nov 12th

3.) Paid November rent and did not request my security deposit back as an act of good faith for cutting the lease early

4.) Moved out November 5th


This is where communication basically stops


5.) January 15th

1369251552.0,1eura5,Pricing and timing strategy for Fanne Mae REOs,walterwhitmanwhite,17,4,27,"Questions for all the REO experts out there.

I currently own most of the units in a condo building and am looking to acquire the last couple for consolidation. One of them has been going through foreclosure and has been listed as a Fannie Mae Homepath REO. (I tried to acquire it before it reached this stage but was unsuccessful.)

I expect to be the only serious bidder because:

1. Condos are ice cold in this area

2. No buyer can obtain conventional financing because the majority of the units in the building are owned by me and used as rentals

3. I gave the condo association a right of first refusal

Because of the above I believe I can get the unit for a good price. I picked up its identical sister units for $73k apiece and it is listed at $90k. Perhaps I am deluding myself but I feel that at some point FNMA will just sell it to me for a nominal sum ($10k or $20k) because they will not get any other serious offers.

My questions are:

1. Does anyone know the strategy that FNMA uses to determine what price they will accept? For example will they reduce their acceptance price by a certain percentage for every month that it goes unsold? This would help me to figure out the lowest price I can offer at any given time.

2. Is there some minimum price that FNMA will not go below? For example if they will never sell for less than some percentage of the original asking price then I will focus my energies on offering at that minimum instead of holding out for a nominal sum.

3. Is there some timing strategy I should use for making offers? For example would it be to my benefit or my detriment to make early low offers

Thanks for all your expertise!

If I *do* go through with it, etc. Or should I just demand the seller make this improvements as part of the contract?

""Appliances and plumbing fixtures:		

Landlord has supplied Tenant with a refrigerator, washing machine, dryer, and plumbing fixtures in good working condition. Landlord shall guarantee these for 30 (thirty) day from Tenant’s possession; thereafter Tenant shall be responsible for ordinary repairs to the Premise’s appliances, plumbing and heating system. Ordinary repairs shall be defined as those repairs costing less than $200.00 (Two Hundred Dollars) occurrence. Landlord shall be responsible for any additional cost thereafter, except for repairs or replacements caused by Tenant, Tenant’s guests or service people’s negligence or misuse
The foregoing charge shall be payable by Tenant irrespective of whether repairs are performed by Landlord or Tenant. If paid by Landlord

This sounds really fishy to me. This is not the first time I have rented a house, and heating system. Since the house is 100 years old this would obviously cost me. It also seems like this is a way for the landlord to transfer some of the responsibility of owning the property, in this case what I would consider the cost of doing business, to the tenant. I also know that these repairs are tax deductible for the landlord. There are already clauses in the lease agreement (boilerplate stuff) that protect the landlord in cases where the tenant brakes something, the tenant fixes it - that part I completely understand. So why would they include this? Is this normal?

EDIT: This seems to be an issue of some contention. I understand that as a landlord of a house you want your tenant to be responsible, you are the type of landlord more interested in money than anything else).

The more I'm digging into this the less convinced I am that an LLC is
the way to go. I think a regular corporation suits our needs better from a taxation standpoint.

While an LLC avoids double taxation

While combined state and federal corp rates are slightly higher than personal (24.5% vs 20%), whether you have the money in hand or not.

 Since we plan to leave profits in the business
 sense for us to pay 33.3% instead of 24.5% every year. We would have to pay personal taxes at the Dividend Tax rate (which is lower than regular personal at 15% I think) when we distribute funds out in the future
Dividend tax once on a future dividend while paying the corp rate the whole time is going to result in a lower overall tax burden than straight up personal from year 1. Never mind the personal cash flow implications of having to pay taxes each year on money you don't even have yet.

I entered the house and it was untouched.  Doors locked.  No indication he managed to enter the house.  Sinks and bathtub completely dry.

I think he's living in the back neighbor's shed and parking in front of my house and using the yard as a passthrough to get to the shed.

1322258790.0,mp9er,Advice for First-Time CA Home Buyers - My wonderful/horrible experience buying a condo,viperboy333,15,2,4,"Having spent the last 12 months buying a home

Basics: Condo in Southern California
Previously sold in 2006 for ~$450K; Short-sale. 

Buying a home can be a long and complex process. As a perfectionist, likely, you won't have time to read and understand everything. 

**Tip 1:** Don't try to understand and micro-manage everything. There is simply too much information. Instead

I started the home buying process by doing some general research (e.g.

Thus

1. Buyer: YOU
2. Buyer's Agent: The person showing you the homes
3. Mortgage Broker / Direct Lender: The person(s) giving you the loan to buy the property
4. Escrow Agent: The person helping with the closing process
5. Title Agent: The person giving you title insurance for the property. 
6. Homeowner Insurance Agent: The person giving you hazard insurance (fire
7. Homeowner Association / Homeowner's Association Mgmt Company: If you are purchasing a property in a planned community
8. Seller's Agent: The person helping the Seller sell the home.
9. Seller: The current person trying to sell the home.
10. Seller's Lender: The lender(s) that own the loan on the property you want to buy
11. General Property Inspector / Pest Inspector / Appraiser / Others: Other folks you'll have to talk to likely at some point in time during he process. More on some of these folks later. 

As you can see, he or she won't tell you all of the above. He or she will just start asking you about what house you want to buy and show you around. Not the route I'd go, but let me tell you why I think most Buyer's Agents don't tell you the above: 
1) tell you all this information takes a lot of time and you might be only a potential client. If I spend all the time educating the Buyer but the Buyer uses another Buyer's Agent
2) if most people knew how complex the home buying process is going to be

**Tip 2:** Tip 2: Learn what role each of the person above will do for you. Research it online. Ask your Buyer Agent. (Some of the folks will be recommended by your Buyer's Agent.) In any case

For me, my Buyer's Agent didn't live up to my expectations (perhaps my expectations are high).  

**Tip 3:**Interview a few Buyer's Agent and pay one agent to go through the ENTIRE home buying process with you. For first-time home buyers, the better the actual process.  While most agents are going to say ""I'll be there to guide you when it's time"", usually, guidance at that point in time is too little too late. Recognize that once an offer to buy an house is accepted, there is only typically 17 days to get everything done and you likely have a job to balance at the same time. 


My first agent: I picked because he had 1) great credentials, but wasn't the excited about the idea. 

Perhaps I didn't have the right working style and had asked more questions than typically

My second agent: I picked someone again with experience and specific knowledge of the condo area I was looking to purchase. She's been extremely helpful to getting everything together and pushing me to make decisions. Again, I didn't feel I got everything I had ""expected"" from my agent. 

I think its partly because I couldn't really trust my agent to act in my best interest knowing the incentive structure for an agent (more on this later) and partly because I wasn't always the most communicative with her about all my intentions (again

**Tip 4:** Having a Buyer's Agent who is willing to educate you and put you first is the most important. If you are smart and hardworking

But recognize most good/great agents probably don't like first-time home buyers. Why? Several reason. 

1. First-time home buyers are more needy and require more hand holding
2. First-time home buyers typically buy smaller/cheaper homes =&gt; resulting in smaller commissions for the Buyer's Agent. 
3. First-time home buyers may talk to multiple agents before either picking an agent or not going through with the process =&gt; thus if the first Buyer's Agent spends a lot of time educating the first-time home buyer

Here are some thoughts on what property investors need to know in order to complete a successful renovation on time and on budget.  

1.	Choose properties that need mainly cosmetic work

Investors need to avoid properties with structural damage

2.	Find a valuer

One of the biggest misconceptions investors have is that the more they spend renovating a property,000 to your home’s value. 

3.	Be realistic when doing it yourself

Most novice renovators attempting DIY go under budget when estimating the costs.  A tip is to double your expected cost and time frame and then work out if you’re still going to make a profit.  

Also investors add up the cost of taking time away from a job or family and see if the potential profit outweighs the potential risk. 

4.	Use a project manager

There are too many risks involved in managing a project alone.  Some tradespeople capitalise on investors’ lack of experience – in terms of cost,000 renovation into a $60,000 - $80,000 job in the long run – not to mention the added time it might take.  Each week you go over time is a week’s lost rent or extra mortgage repayment.  

Using a project manager will often get you access to trade prices rather than retail

When investors do their research, renovations go well - potentially resulting in owners earning tens of thousands of dollars in equity in the first year alone.  Even if the property market hasn’t moved in your local area, renovations can create artificial growth in your property’s value.

I signed a lease to move in on Aug 1st, I found that carpets near a drain in the laundry room was wet. Property manager told me to call a plumber and the cost will be deducted from our rent next month.

The plumber was about to tell that it was sewage backflow due to a blockage - which flushed out itself when he was testing the waterflow. (~50 dollars) He also recommended we get a professional carpet cleaner to dry the area because of possible mildew/mold growth.

Today, I called the property manager and asked for a permission (also because the technicians needed permission from our property manager). On the phone, she said ""it will have to be done, since if left, it could cause all sorts of trouble."" She gave me a permission to pay using my check, also saying that she will deduct it from the rent. Note that she also emailed me cc'ing the owner saying ""this is to clarify that whatisitbro will pay 1400 out of his pocket and that amount will be deducted from next months rent.""

fast forward couple of hours

Now

I showered once

**TL:DR - I paid 1400 dollars for sewage backflow flood damages, and that she will not pay me back. Note this flood happened the day of move-in. I will appreciate any advice.**

**FINAL UPDATE: The landlord emailed me back after couple of conversations with her. She apologized for the situation and the confusion and said she instructed the prop manager that the deduction is okay.

About three years ago my parents went through *A Series of Unfortunate Events* that left them:

* Homeless
* Unemployed
* Disabled
* Assetless
* Incomeless

In order to be a *Good Son* and to keep them off the streets

Two months ago they were approved for disability payments from the Social Security Administration. The final calculations aren't complete but it appears their income will be around $1200/mo. They have begun to pay their own rent but I am still paying their utilities and some other non-housing expenses.

Their current housing is in a high-crime area and they are over 1

**This post is about real estate

I am a homeowner with wife

I can't afford to throw away the 25%-40% I use as a down payment. This is basically college money for my young children and I need this to be an investment property - even if the investment doesn't pay off for many years.

When applying for a property loan I believe this would basically be positioned as a rental property. The intention is for my parents to make monthly payments to me for housing. Ideally that payment would cover the costs of the property

**First Question**: Is there some way to present all this to the bank that would make better sense than calling it a rental property

So far I have thought about three sorts of properties.

My first thought was to find a one-story condominium (need to avoid stairs). I liked the idea of a condominium because neither my parents nor I would have to be responsible for exterior maintenance (mowing, typical Association fees for my area run around $200/mo and that seems somewhat high for the services provided that I care about.

My second thought was to find a small single-family ranch-style home to put them in. This puts the duty to do all the yard work and snow removal back on me - but I think I can hire that out for less than equivalent Association dues would cost.

My third thought was to try to turn this into a small income-producing situation and purchase a two-unit duplex. My parents could occupy one unit and hypothetically the renter of the second unit could be responsible for yard care and snow removal (or I could hire that out).

**Second Question**: Am I missing any obvious choices? Does any one of the above stand out as a better choice than the others?

I have done no research and have no knowledge of any tax or legal implications of effectively becoming landlord to my parents. So my **third question** is whether there is anything significant here I should be aware of.

1369008505.0,1enuso,Renting to Family and Taxes,rental_ta,15,3,20,"I'm in somewhat of a quandary in relation to renting a home to a family member. Here's the backstory:


My mom (mid 50s) has pretty bad credit due to a bankruptcy in her past (long story, and her neighbors are horrible (late nice police action, constantly barking dogs, people screaming at kids, etc.). The only loan my mom can get at this point is an FHA loan, but that comes with extra fees and few sellers in the area will accept a buyer with an FHA loan.


My (mid 20s) credit, and she would use that as her primary residence and transfer money to my account to pay for the mortgage, utilities, taxes, etc. I would stay in the rental I'm in at the moment close to work (as long as I keep my current job). This property would most likely be a long-term buy that I will probably keep as a rental property even after my mom vacates the property (for whatever reason). One worry with the long-term buy is that I plan on moving out of the state in the next 5 years or so, and I expect my mom to still be in the house at that time. And after she vacates, I would need to manage a rental from another state.


I originally wasn't planning on claiming any of the money my mom transfers to me as income. This was based on a number of family friends and coworkers saying they either have this exact arrangement (either with their kids in a second home or grandparents in their family home) or know someone who does. My real estate and mortgage brokers told me the same thing (apparently there's a TON of people currently doing this


But I wanted to make sure I wasn't going to set myself up for an audit in the future (particularly since I plan on starting up some business with friends in the coming years). So I started reading up on the IRS site about renting, which would mean I would need to claim the money my mom gives me as income (most definitely pushing me into a higher tax bracket), even though I wouldn't be making any profit off of the arrangement (except perhaps for the mortgage that gets paid down). Where I start getting lost is when the IRS site starts going into personal use, what constitutes personal use, what personal use means for considering the property a rental, and all the stuff about deductions. The amount of money that my mom transfers to me each month will probably be below Fair Market Value for that type of house and the area, which seems to bring with it even more tax exceptions and rules.


I've already been pre-approved for a loan and found a nice townhome that's in good condition (and costs less than my pre-approval amount) in the town where my mom lives. My mom is ready to pull the trigger on this

**edit #1:** The mortgage loan I've been pre-approved for is a primary mortgage.

**edit #2:** As I'm still unclear on the whole personal use issue

**edit #3:** Thank you everyone for your responses! After speaking to some accountants and more mortgage brokers, requires twice the down payment and additional cash reserves. Legally, I can't make this work. As much as I want to help my mom, I don't want to go to jail for mortgage fraud and tax evasion.

P.S. I'm still not sure this arrangement will be cheaper for my mom than renting,False,,t5_2qipl,1369096104.0,,,t3_1enuso

We just had an offer accepted on a home that we have fallen in LOVE with. The area is fantastic, 10 minutes from his mom's house and 10 minutes from mine. It’s in a good school district and close to the business center of town. No sex offenders and no foreclosures in the area. 

BUT it's only a 2bd home. It does have 2 baths (master and guest). We already have 2 kids (a boy and girl they're both under 2 years old) so our plan was to have them share a room for a while anyway... we were hoping to add a room in a space that would be very easy to continue the flow of the home (there's an inset corner that's already in the bedroom area).... in our area additions run about $100/sq ft. The house is currently 1600 sq ft.

My question is... are we out of our minds? We submitted a low offer and the seller met us in the middle with our closing costs paid... So,000). The houses were built in the early 70s. Many of the homes in this neighborhood have been remodeled and have fantastic curb appeal (ours doesn't, it may actually be the ugliest in the neighborhood but it's been empty for a while). We're buying the home from a trust.

The neighborhood is filled with 2bd, they run around 180k and the 4bd are about 210k. 

Pretty much everyone I'm talking to thinks my husband and I are crazy. My husband and I think we're geniuses. It's simple... buy a 2bd at a discount (because no one wants them) and add a room later (we're thinking 5yrs)! Then we get the home we want

Realtor showed us a house the first day that it was on the market.  Saw that the home was a great deal and had the papers drawn up and placed an offer that was 3k above asking price.  Our Realtor submitted the paper work to the Owners' Realtor and the Realtor stated via text message, our Realtor stated it would not be a problem as we had been pre-approved for a home purchase for well above what the house was listed at.  So obtaining the property specific pre-approval would not be an issue and we would be able to get it on Monday.  

This morning at about 10am our Realtor called and stated that the Owners' Realtor had told her that they had accepted another offer from someone who had a pre-approval specific to the property. 

My Realtor is furious that the owners' Realtor had stated that the owner had accepted our offer only to state that they took another less than 15 hours later.  She stated that she is going to call the other Realtor's broker and inform them that this occurred.  She also stated that she would contact a Real Estate lawyer and see if we had an legal recourse. 

We really would like to obtain this home and begin the process of owning it.  I know that there is many other homes out there in central Ohio but we had really felt like we had obtained our home especially since they had accepted our offer and told our Realtor via text message.

I'm working with a realtor to try to buy my first home

The mortgage/loan stuff is through a major bank


The problem I'm facing is that the majority of these HUDs are going for above asking/list price - between $3, but upwards of $18-20k above asking in other areas. However, as I understand it, if the appraised value is lower than the offer, the difference will need to be paid up front (can't be financed).

Assuming this is true, I believe, is a FHA appraisal and is used to set the list price). I'm guessing the former is unlikely, but when I talk to my realtor or my mortgage guy they both tell me there's no way of knowing for sure what number my appraiser will come back with.


I'm essentially in a position where I have to offer over list price to have a chance of winning the bid, or am I simply stuck paying extra money up front to make sure I win the bid? Would I be better off trying to catch a non-HUD sale within the extremely limited windows they are on the market? Should I just renew my lease on my apartment for another 6-12 months and hope it's more of a buyer's market by then?

1368328283.0,1e5y8p,Want to build a small apartment complex or multi-family home next door,NextDoorInvestment,19,6,15,"Hi all

I own a house on a lake in upstate New York known for relatively affluent (for the area) waterfront residential properties. I also own the vacant neighboring lot which is about the same size: 1 acre of land with 100 ft of waterfront. They are separate lots and I pay taxes on them separately. Right now the vacant lot is all trees

I'm interested in clearing the trees and constructing an apartment building or a multi-family home on the vacant lot. I believe such a building could house two apartments luxuriously, with the goal of each apartment possessing equally striking views of the lake.

I'm not too concerned with the one-time expenses relating to construction. I can liquidate some investments to deal with that. What worries me is making sure when all is said and done I end up with a property I can rent out for a reliable profit.

So

- How can I determine what construction limitations I have with regards to zoning so I can figure out how many apartments I can reasonably construct?

- Since total taxes+insurance on my main house are around $7k/yr

- How can I determine average monthly maintenance costs on such a property? I'm not very handy, etc. I am willing to manage the property myself though in terms of advertising, finding tenants, dealing with tenants, etc. And I'm willing to learn how to do common maintenance tasks, but I don't have much confidence that I'll be any good at it right now, as I've never owned an apartment building. :)

- How can I determine how much to charge in rent? See below...

Some facts about rentals in the area:

Similar apartments to what I'd like to construct seem to bottom out at $700/mo but go as high as $1500/mo and I'm not entirely sure why the range varies so much since they seem so similar on the surface

My house is about a 20 minute commute from the more urban side of the lake, which leads me to believe that while I cannot command the highest rents, I could perhaps command rents somewhere in the middle of the range and attract upper-middle class suburban tenants.

Some napkin math:

- Maybe $1k/mo in taxes+insurance?

- Maybe $1k/mo in maintenance? Would reserve $12k/yr to deal with whatever maintenance issues may come up.

- That means I'd need around $2k/mo in rental income on average to break even in a ""bad"" maintenance year.
- Or put another way

- If all four apartments were filled at that rental rate I'd be making a considerable profit ($2k-$3k in profit per month after expenses depending on how costly maintenance is each year) assuming I'm doing my napkin math right.

However, or maintenance expenses are anywhere near accurate. So I'm reaching out to you guys, the experts, for help on determining how I can arrive at more accurate expenses/income estimates.

I made one offer with a 48 hour signback and didn't hear anything for 5 days.  It almost seems unethical?  

I would never even relocate to this area but my son was just diagnosed with a medical disorder and I am moving to the area so he can be closer to a treatment center.  I feel like every week that passes is time he isn't getting help

Can anyone offer any advice as to what I can do to look better on paper?

1364240826.0,1azqh3,Thinking about walking away from my condo. Has anyone been through this before?,foreclosure123,21,7,58,"Hi All

I purchased my condominium in 2008 when I was 22 years old. I had just graduated from college and I wanted to take advantage of the $8000 first time home buyer tax credit (the one you didn't have to pay back). I purchased my unit for 95K. The unit was originally purchased in 2004 for ~120k. My realtor assured me that the market could only get better, I bought the condo.

After I moved in, replacing cheap carpet with high end laminate flooring (12mm, single plank), and replacing linoleum in the kitchen and bathroom with porcelain tile. Anyway, I got engaged last year and decided that it was time to sell my condo in hopes of buying a house. My fiance and I want to have children and we can't do that in my tiny condo. Problem is: it's been listed for a year now and although I have had ~15 showings, there hasn't been a single offer. I recently dropped the price down to 89K, which is basically the lowest I can go, it will still end up being a loss

Even at 89K for several months, there's been a rash of other foreclosures in my development, and condos are going for a steal. There were a couple last year (foreclosures) that sold in the low 70s, and one recently that sold for 82K.

I don't have an extra 10 or 15 thousand dollars to pay up my mortgage and sell for really cheap. My mortgagee is not interested in discussing a short sale with me unless I can show financial hardship, I know the HOA is hemorrhaging money due to back dues, and I fear a large assessment at some point in the near future. I want out, and I want out SOON.

I am considering keeping my unit listed through the summer real estate season and then, my biggest concern is the personal effect it will have on my credit, and on my future spouses credit (he is not listed as an owner on the mortgage or deed)

Within the last year I purchased a home.  I bought using only half of what the bank was willing to lend to me.  I love the new home and the location.  Here is one thing I have been thinking about lately:

My home is a corner lot.  To the side of it there is a 1/4 acre wooded vacant lot.  My property is fenced in by a wooden fence but my bedroom window faces this wooded lot.  (Not the best thing to look at sometimes)  The property is **not** listed for sale.  I looked the property up online and I found that it was bought in the height of the market 2008 for $25


I'm really interested in trying to acquire this property to use for future expansion.  My goal would be to either get financing (money is cheap right now so that might do)  or if necessary I can use cash on it.  


Can anybody give tips or advice on how to plan the road map for this adventure?  Should I just call the property owner and straight up ask?   I think it's best if I don't state upfront that I live next door incase the property owner tries to use that against me in negotiations.

My thought process thus far has been along these lines:

-Leaning towards a condo because I don't know much about general upkeep/fixing etc.  I figure a condo is less work the homeowner has to do.  I also travel quite a bit so at some point I may have to factor in a management company. I have read warnings about HOA fees though.  Also, the easier it will be to keep renters.

-Trying to get something in an up and coming neighborhood.  There's a handful of areas in DC that are gentrifying and are not the same dangerous areas they were several years ago.

-Planning on putting 20% down.  No credit issues.  I've been messing around with the mortgage calculators a bit to get an idea of how much I would have to rent it out for.  I have been using 4% interest rate for a 30 year mortgage.  Also factoring in HOA dues as well as yearly tax.  Anything else I am forgetting about?

-Whats the general rule to determine what price range you should be looking at?

-Also if anyone is familiar with DC area real estate

I'm a landlord renting a house to a section 8 tenant in California. The house was newly remodeled before being rented. The tenant has been in there for 6 months now and called me on Monday of last week complaining about bedbugs. I had pest control people go in and confirm that it is bedbugs. Heat treatment of bedbugs for the house will cost about 1800 dollars. I am sure that the tenants or tenant's guests brought in the bed bugs. Who should pay for the treatment? Even if I pay for it this time

Edit: Thanks for all your responses guys. The other co-owner of the house thought 1800 for heat treatment was too expensive so she opted for chemical spray. It will cost about 500 dollars for 3 treatments. Since the infestation is early stage,False,,t5_2qipl,1340594149.0,,,t3_vi76g

1339270710.0,utjof,Clarifying the online home search – where to find the best search.,ColKlink007,19,6,8,"
I just want to let people know how this works because so many search a lot of different sites for properties or think there are sites that have more or a different list of properties.

All listing start out from root local MLS boards, Homes.com, etc to grab the listing data.  To prove this any listing you see anywhere on the web will have the original listing agents name and company somewhere in small print.

Then what happens through a IDX system the listings from all the root local MLS boards are fed to a central database then to all the other websites usually with a day or two delay.

So if you're serious about looking for a property here's how you get a head of all the other buyers looking at old data.  Google or ask your agent for the local MLS website this data is real time and generally has consumer access.  Real time is important because lets say if a  property is listed today you can see it on the local MLS boards site today otherwise real estate portals it could be days.  

The very best thing to do is ask your agent to set you up on alerts based on your search criteria.  This makes searching properties effortless and you get a email soon as a property that meets your criteria hits the market. Also with the root mls there are more search options to fine tune what your looking for.

And by the way all banks list their properties in local MLS systems so if your looking for that “secret bank owned property list no one knows about” there isn't one. Banks want to get the highest and best price and they only way they can do this is the MLS system.

Oh also no ads or obnoxious marketing on the local MLS systems either.

1325860514.0,o5fuz,Some of what I know about lead generating in Real Estate,slidellian,14,2,5,"I’ve been asked by a few Redditors to comment further on ‘lead generating’
First off, than my listing appointments. The reason is that without lead gen time, I will have no listings, and, “He who lists, lasts.” It’s that simple. 

So what is lead generating? Lead generating is the process of contacting people to try and get new business going. It can mean contacting people that are either in your database currently, expired listings (those that were listed, and the listing period ended with resulting in a sale), calling on people in your database and asking who they know that is thinking about buying, selling, or investing that you can call, going to garage sales and talking to the owners, mainly because there just aren’t that many leads that fall into brokerage’s laps. There are plenty of people that want to buy and sell; you just have to be able to find them on your own.

One more very bold way of lead generating is (get ready for this one) calling the agent who has the expired listing and offering them a 26.2% referral fee if they’ll send that seller over to you. Many listings that expire can become much harder to work on, you want to *really* capture their attention to keep them from rejecting you and not listening. When you say 26.2, they’ll silently wonder why.

When calling expired listings, but it just didn’t sell for some reason the first time they had it on the market. You have to call them and see when they plan to hire the right agent for the job to sell their house. Make an appointment with them where you can just take 15 minutes of their time to show them what you do to get houses sold. At that point, you can get in the door and get the listing. The second thing to remember (and you really need to tell yourself this over and over before you start calling) is “They’re home, they’re happy, and they want me to call.” It’s true. And if you don’t call, your competition will. Who do you want to have the listing? You, or your competition?

FSBOs are also a great source of leads. Many FSBOs are willing to pay a buyer’s agent a commission to bring a buyer; they just don’t want to pay a listing agent and a buyer’s agent. If you can convince them to pay just a little bit more commission to hire you, because they may be able to use some of your techniques to help themselves. “I could come by tonight at 3, or would 6 be better?”

FSBOs want to sell, you can refer them to another agent. 

When calling people to add to your database

The Yellow Pages are another great source of leads. Open the YP and find a few businesses. Call them, and you’d like to stop by and meet them face to face. At that point, you can get their business cards, and give them a few of yours. Chances are good that someone in the business will have some real estate need, or they know someone who does. 

So what’s all this about putting your leads into a database? You do this because for every 12 people you have in your MET database (that’s people you’ve met face to face at least once) you can expect at least one transaction per year. 144 contacts should work out to 12 transactions. For every 50 people you have in your UNMET database (this is people who you have in your database for when you do mail outs to a subdivision or people who you are friends with on Facebook, in a rotation of email, phone call, personal visit, post card in the mail, and otherwise. You want to convert your unmet people to mets, so get our and meet folks. You want to keep in front of all of these people so that when they think real estate, when you think of beer

Those are the very basics of lead generation. It’s the most vital part of this business

Things went well for a few years, and after a while we finally decided to call in our promissory notes (which led to suing him since he told us to fuck off). The lawsuit process took 18 months, and we finally got a court date. The entire time he played hardball, telling us he was ""judgement proof"" and would bankrupt himself before paying us a penny. Finally, he ran out of money fighting us and saw the court date coming, so he settled and signed a far better contract, secured with mortgages on his rental properties. It also had a confession of judgement built in. So we then had primary mortgages on three of the properties. After the settlement, and stopped communicating completely.


After 2-4 more months, we realized it was much uglier than we imagined... He had burned bridges with everyone imaginable; Police, fire dept, local govt officials, lawyers, tenants, etc. EVERYONE seemed to want this guy's head on a platter. He foreclosed on his house (~$250k) and it's now deserted. He hasn't paid taxes and utilities on the properties for years in some cases. Essentially he was collecting the rent, and not paying for any expenses. Half of his tenants are about to get kicked out of his properties due to various fire code violations and delinquent utility bills. We've spent over $20k on legal expenses so far


After talking to our lawyer today, but the lawyer thinks it's a terrible idea, because it will take forever. He thinks we should cut our losses and sell the mortgages, and write off the unpaid balance. Of course tracking John down is also a priority, so that we can actually serve him legal documents regarding actions.

He has been working with a buyer, and apparently our house ticks pretty much every checkbox on this buyer's list.

We hadn't even considered that this could happen.  Our agent was very up-front with the breakdown on the seller's fees (7%, and he goes far beyond what anyone else is doing in our area).  Anyway, the tricky part is that a pre-market sale puts him in disclosed dual-agency, and kind of negates his marketing justification.  Is this a situation where fees would/could/should be renegotiated?

We're not really sure how to proceed.  The current projected selling range just barely gets us out of our mortgage.  We could offer it for sale, dealing with open houses, etc.

my situation right now is I found a house I want, and the seller agreed to immediately rent it from me until june, as he doesnt need to leave this soon. I have no problem with the buy and rent until im there. I just dont want to attempt to buy now, not get my preapproval then have an unnecessary extra credit inquiry.

Nearly all my finances current and old are through USAA since 2007/8, and an older co-signed auto loan from my divorce. My exwife pays the cosign loan, and has never been late. I know they still take this into consideration on my debt to income ratio. Is there anything she can write stating she pays it, or get from the bank to show that she is and has been responsible with it (financed through the same bank)? Same for the renting out of my house, I assume a copy of the contract and proof of payments should be good to cover that? those are the two main things im concerned about

I've looked around and have found quite a few lots going for $20k - $30k in areas that are near the universities. I realize that some lots may not be zoned for 4plexes or that the community in a particular area might frown upon one

- Buyers agent has told us that the buyer is a church leader and the church is paying cash for the house. However
- Buyers agent sent us a letter from the church secretary on church letterhead stating their intent to pay for the house with church funds. I did some basic googling including searching facebook for any information on the church secretary and/or the buyer. I found the buyers facebook page (wide open
- After some additional searching it appears the buyer may be high up in a pyramid scheme type company. This could explain where the money is coming from. He could be using the church as a tax shelter. 

Here's the big red flags for me: 
- Paying $250k cash for a house. The church does not seem legit so it's doubtful they have a trust. Why is the money taking until February to become available. 
- Whats the rush to move in. Why rent back for a month and half. 

My real estate agent has requested proper documentation of the funds. At this point I'm pretty sure I won't be entertaining the offer but I'm curious what the scam here might be. Anyone have any ideas?

I've always been interested in real estate investing

I ended up writing out a much longer post

My situation:
1. Parent's divorced in 2008
2. On 4.3.09 I find my mother deceased in her bedroom after I went upstairs to ask her what she'd like for breakfast
3. After a battle with the executor(my uncle

That's the beginning of my story. From my mother's estate I received a sizable sum

I contacted my Father, he recommended an old associate of his to manage my new properties for him. This is where I met Ken, my current property manager; he's an awesome guy. He's not cheap, he charges me 15% of the rent each month for each unit, and any other work he does is at a flat rate of  $45 an hour, he's qualified and capable of doing any and everything except for electrical work and heating &amp; air, he's been a lifesaver even though I know he does charge more than usual for property managers. 

My father also introduced me to another investor friend of his Kyle. Kyle and his partner Tony collectively own over 70 rental units with their company, 3.5 bath home along with my own residence now(4 bed 3 bath on 5 acres)

Fast forward two years, and now I think I'm ready to sell since I'll avoid short term capital gains tax. 

So here's what's been rattling around up in my head. Ken my property manager has 6 units, and wants to sell all his units at one time, and asked me if I would be interested in buying him out down the road. He has 2 duplex's and 2 single family homes for the total of 6 units overall. After expenses his cash flow is $3,900 a month. I've seen his books to verify this. I currently have 60k in the bank, but I also have the rental property paid for that has been a real pain to keep rented.

So what I'd like to do, and depending on the nature that could take anywhere between 3-6 months to complete a deal. So I've still got great deductions with the two units I still have with mortgages(15 years) and my own personal home with a 30 year mortgage, plus Ken's fee and the work he does on them for me. My long term goal is to build up a large amount of cash, which I can then use to purchase all 6 of ken's units outright from him and also continue to invest in the foreclosure with Kyle's company at the same time. I've come to realize I can make boat loads more money with Kyle, but the problem is the taxes, which is why I want to keep the two units I have with mortgages and my own personal house, for the tax deductions

I am not really interested in stocks/commodities as I tried my hand and got burned badly. I am interested in creating an LLC to put my existing units under and possibly another LLC to do the foreclosures with Kyle.

http://www.flickr.com/photos/erocsid/sets/72157629470077587/

Brand new townhouse, 2 bed, 1.5 bath (2x3/4, no tubs), main bedroom loft, rooftop deck, radiant heat, 0.6 miles from the new light rail. It is a perfect mix of affordability, we'd stay renting if the rental market wasn't getting so gouge-y and we weren't sick of moving every 2 years or so.

My SO and I had been out with Redfin (can't say enough nice things about Redfin!) three times to look at places over fall/winter and decided to wait until summer because we weren't super impressed. We agreed to not even bother looking until the summer but one morning she said ""Okay

It was a brand new, but only 1 had a realtor with them and was doing tours like us.

5 days after being listed,"" he said. He pointed out commercial quality materials, extra wall widths, new styles of construction, and couldn't find any cut corners. We went back to the seller with 15 nit-picky little items and they agreed to do every single one of them.

Within 48 hours I put an offer in. All 8 were under contract within 30 days and 3 have already closed as far as I know.

It was an interesting experience that started out with me getting pre-approved by BoA -- a horrible decision in hind-sight. I wanted my financing to be unrelated to my realtors and I wanted to have it together before even looking at our first unit. Unfortunately, I got pre-approved and I figured we'd just go around to places listed above the pre-approved amount, lowballing them at what the bank will give me, and see if we got lucky.

We had seen a few units we were interested in but they were not ones that were going to come down in price -- about 10-20% too expensive -- and in sort of shitty locations.

Then this unit came along listed at exactly what I was pre-approved for and we made the offer. Our realtor expected the seller to allow a bidding war to happen

21 days into the process -- 10 days before closing -- I got a call from my loan officer at BoA saying, we can't do a residential loan, our hands are tied, sorry."" My realtor immediately got title involved and showed them it was zoned mixed-use, and after BoA continued to try to blame government regulations, they finally admitted it was a BoA policy preventing them from doing the loan. They consider the specific type of zoning ""high-risk"" (and Chase told me they wouldn't do it either, but they took about 24 hours to decide that

I consider this a major fuck up on BoA's part because they should not have allowed 21 days to pass before looking at basic information about the property like how it is zoned and if they fund mortgages zoned like that (not to mention incorrectly blaming the government for being unable to do the mortgage). And, so fuck BoA's lack of diligence. But it doesn't matter now and I'm beyond over it.

This is all because the street-facing unit has the lower level dedicated to a small office that opens to the street. My unit (and the other 6) are 100% residential. But this doesn't matter because the entire lot is zoned as mixed-use to allow for the 1 unit to be mixed use. It seems pretty stupid in my mostly clueless opinion (I'm a computer nerd

My realtor immediately set me up with a Redfin preferred lender -- Sterling Savings -- but the closing costs were much higher than BoA's estimates, and told Sterling to hold on because I need to get more bids. I spent a frantic 48 hours getting 3 more bids that were all not significantly different from what Sterling was offering me so I called them back and said let's do it.

With a new lender in place

The mortgage process is just hoop after hoop after hoop. At one point they needed a 1099-MISC from 2009 within 24 hours. I kept saying to myself: one day they will demand a single plum floating in perfume in a man's hat -- so I better keep that shit on hand.

Exactly 30 days after locking in my second try at a mortgage

Towards the end of the process, really easy to talk to, got some interesting history about the development process and the neighborhood as they did the walk-through with me (that they didn't have to do, other people were there for that). Also, I was really glad to hear it was like their 10th project together and all of their projects sell quickly. They seemed like nice people and, slightly more importantly, really seemed like they knew what they were doing.

The above has been my observation for homes listing in my city. I kind of feel alone in this. 

As an example with hypothetical numbers and features but reflecting a real life situation I'm in:

I saw a home listed for $270, although a few security features made the home safe. I saw a home listed right next to it for $249,000. However, that one sold just a day before I saw it and my agent did not tell me about it. I offered $250,000 for the one available listed for $270,000. The seller said they would not sell for less than $265,000. I said it is not worth more than $255,000. I said that if they want $265,000. They said they will look for other buyers. Well

What should I do here? 

My agent says I should just take it because the seller has come half way. For my agent,000 remaining in the negotiation doesn't makes sense for him. 

However, even if the amounts that remains in play in negotiation are small. The original listing price of $270,000 was a cooked up price anyway. Better properties are now listing around this one for $275,000. Just because they've come down half way, it doesn't mean that the property is worth that much. It needs work to make it worth that much, which either the seller should do before selling to me or reduce the price so I can get it done.

I've been noticing a trend in southern california, but due to low inventory, list prices are much higher (20-30% higher).  I.e. home comes on MLS for 400k, when other homes in the area are listed at 475-500k.  Then immediately goes pending.

Shouldn't the banks know that their properties are being sold for below market price?  I'm assuming the BPO will seem acceptable since the homes sold a few months ago were around that price.

We recently put down an offer on a condo and have been working with a lender to close as soon as possible because the seller's agent has set a deadline to close within 40 days. 

A few days into the process I was offered a job at a new company in the same industry and city for a lot more money per year. Being that it was a huge raise and a better company

When I brought this up with our lender

We were SO excited about this condo because we have been looking for almost a year now. Prices just kept going up or we'd get beat out by all cash offers above list price, etc. We'd hate to see all of that go away and to start back at square one, but I'm not sure if there are any other options at this point.

The things that are worrying me the most are:

- I don't have any information about the condition of the roof

- I have no idea how much (if any) insulation is in the walls

- All the windows in the house are the original single pane windows. Almost all of them have fairly new storm windows on the outside, can be done to mitigate this without having to rip everything out and replace with vinyl windows?

- The basement, but what, if anything, should I be looking for/concerned about with this kind of basement?

1364339267.0,1b2nyk,Nightmare Landlord Need Advice,Circumnavigate,12,1,11,"Hello I am having some serious problems with my land lord and I could use some advice. Sorry for the long post here is a summary as short as I could make

I am on a monthly lease and have been living in this rental for 11 weeks, I told him it was uninhabitable. I researched harmful mold exposure symptoms on the internet and all of my health problems were listed with the advice to abandon immediately if having these symptoms and finding black mold, I put this in the e-mail along with pictures of the positive on my home test kit. Note I also took swab samples to send to a lab which returned positive for harmful mold a week later. I nearly went to the emergency room that day (didn't because of costs but looking back I should of) and went to urgent care the next since it was already closed.

He responded a day later saying that I am mentally insane and a liar, if he would hire a mold specialist, and he did not offer to provide accommodations either. Not happy by his handling of the situation I found a new place to live and moved all of my stuff there 5 days after discovery of the mold in his rental. He said I didn't give him a chance to fix the situation but I told him I can't wait that long and his attitude gave me the impression he won't hire a mold specialist saying he guaranteed one wasn't needed. This was before he even had a chance to come back and see what was happening, also him saying this when I told him I was having problems as serious as loosing feeling in my foot seems like complete negligence.

I had asked him on the phone if he would return half of months rent since I moved out, only time will tell.



I have spent the past couple of days looking up laws and here a couple of things I found in my Nolo books and on the internet. 

-Landlord is required to provide habitable living conditions. They are required to pay for motel or housing costs while repairs are being made or rental is uninhabitable.

-A place can be considered uninhabitable if there is a mold problem effecting tenants health. A place can also be considered uninhabitable if there are no working smoke alarms or no carbon monoxide detectors (gas stove) or no heating for every room.

The place has no C0 detectors, also no screen on a window which past 35 days he hasn't fixed

-For homes built before 1978 you are required to give a lead disclosure along with the lease



I have a couple of questions

I went back to the place 9 days after moving all of my stuff to try and find water damage (nearly all the harmful mold found from the swab test was water damage mold)

I originally wanted rent back from when I moved out but was told no and that the lease ends the last day of the month. So instead I now want him to pay for housing at my new place up until the old lease ends

In 1 e-mail he wrote that hes required by law to return the security deposit to me 3 weeks after the place is vacated. A couple days later in another e-mail writing 3 weeks after the end of the lease. Does anyone know which one it is or if I could use this against the land lord in small claims?

I am thinking of going back there the last day of the month (last day of lease) with my neighbor as a witness and doing a walk thru with video/pictures to show that there are no smoke alarms (35 days after I notified her)

It would cost me $400 to have a mold inspection company go out there and do tests

So here's the story:

I recently graduated from school and just started my first real job. I was hoping to save heavily for the next few years while aggressively paying off my student debt ($50K of it) and trying to accumulate a modest nest egg. I don't love my current job, and then start looking at other opportunities.

My parents, they want me to take out a $250,000 loan at a ~2-3% interest rate for 15 years. They will supply the down payment by canceling their life insurance policy. They think that I'll be able to rent it out (I'm living with them at the moment -- but the point was to save up money before moving out) to recoup a lot of the costs, and that in 15 years, real estate prices will have gone up, and I can reap the profits. I've taken a look at the apartment that they're eyeing, and I'm pretty sure finding renters won't be a problem given its condition and location.

If I were to do this, but I'm stressed out because this seems to be such a huge decision, and I feel largely in the dark. It's entirely my parents' idea, and it came out of the blue. I also hate the idea of accumulating even more debt (one reason I was so into paying off my student debts as soon as possible was for the psychological freedom it would bring me) and having such an illiquid asset. But these are all vague fears, and I haven't been able to articulate any concrete downside to this arrangement.

How do we stop this myth from propogating?  The seller is trying to maximize his total return on the sale.

The buyer's agent's commission increases the expense.  The seller doesn't like expenses.  Therefore, because I don't have a buyer's agent to coordinate the sale for me, I can rationally ask the seller to lower the home's price between 0-3%.  If I asked seller to drop the home price buy 1.5% in return for not hiring a buyer's agent, any rational seller should be pleased.  Both the buyer and the seller save 1.5% by cutting out the middleman (the buyer's agent).

I was given the advice to simply keep quiet about it for now and deal with it in the future (actually by the heater salesman). I'm fine with that advice despite the other problems associated with it (Yes I understand the environmental implications

Inspection turned up nothing major with the home and seller had virtually nothing to disclose. The seller I purchased the home from was quite awful to work with and was very hostile to my inspector.

So one day after taking possession of the house I'm working on cleaning and I start with the master bathroom. I turn on the shower and the flow of water is very slow so slow I don’t think it would be easy to shower with. I after a while discover that there is an adjustment on the shower head itself and I turn it up to full. I work for about 10 minutes or so and my brother comes over to see the new house. I stop working go down to the lower level and I can hear water. So I check the downstairs bathroom and the shower is backed up and over flowing. The floor drain in the utility room is as well.

I open the crawl space access and water is coming in though the floor and though a cracked drain pipe.
I call a family friend who is also a licensed plumber to come look at it the next day. He finds a crack in a pipe my inspector missed

I have my inspector return who admits he should have noticed all of these plumbing issues. He offers to pay for all the parts
Once all of the ABS glue had cured we test the new plumbing by flushing all of the toilets

I talk to my realestate agent and he suggests that I call the home warranty company to auger out the line.
So they come the next day

So at this point I need to have some kind very costly repair done to the homes main sewer line. Every plumber I've spoken to who does these kinds of repair think it would be unlikely that I can get it fixed for less than $5000

I find it very unlikely that the seller was unaware of this issue. I find it possible that they didn't know the full extent but none the less they failed to disclose that the sewer line backs up.

What do you you guys suggest I do next? I have an appointment to have the line scoped with a camera next week and I'm debating on retaining a lawyer. I have documentation form both my plumber and my home inspector that they find it impossible for someone living in the house to not have known about this.

The house was purchased probably in the 50's. It has a stone staircase leading to the main house. The garage is underneath (on ground level). The whole house is supported on old style wood beams that look like they could either fall apart at any moment, never vacuumed, rooms torn up pretty bad: curtains broken, old newspapers taking up half of the rooms... my poor grandma has been sleeping on the couch (which looks like it should have asbestos) and refuses to have anyone help her clear a path to her 30 year old mattress. 

All of us in the family aren't sure how she hasn't died in the filth and clutter yet... main point: Doing a reverse mortgage for her is out of the question (the family already discussed this option). The property location is probably worth somewhere around 250-500k. The property next door sold for 1.5mil. To upgrade/replace everything and do a thorough cleaning of the house would probably run somewhere around 20-50k. The family has half-joked about having to literally burn the place to the ground and just sell the land itself for cheap... 

What kind of options should we be looking at other than reverse mortgage and burning the place to the ground and selling the property?

I've been researching getting into real estate photography.  I have the equipment and the skills.  I have been shooting landscape photography for a few years now.  I've spent many days researching RE photography as a business online.  I have practiced with my own place and feel ready to do this professionally.  

What I need help with is the marketing and business side.  What would convince a Realtor to hire a photographer?  What would turn you away  if a photographer approached you looking for work?  What networking tools can I use?  Is there a popular real estate forum to join?  What about a contract?  Not talking about an ongoing contract

I've researched the local photographers and they have many packages and add-ons, and so on.  There is usually a base cost of $150 for 15 photos, $200 for 20, $250 for 25.   As a photographer, I don't think I can put a number on how many pictures a home needs.  Having a set number limits me.  Maybe a house needs more to accurately showcase, maybe it needs less than 15.  I just don't understand setting packages beforehand without knowing the location.   As for the distance, gas isn't cheap but at most it will only cost 10 dollars to travel 20-30 miles, why should I?

I feel a simple cost profile is best.  I want to have a set base rate of $150.  It will include all editing and travel.   How do I charge more for larger homes without screwing the realtor and without knowing how many pictures it will take?  What is your experience with this?

Now

Tip 7: Find a blank RPA and read it. The California Realtors Association should have a copy somewhere online. 

The RPA has all kinds of information
1. Offer price and earnest money deposit
2. Loan rate and type
3. Inspection period before you can cancel offer limited financial impact

Most of the other information on the RPA are disclosures and notices of one type or another. I'll talk about one key disclosure in detail that applies specificallyl to short-sales: General Home Inspection. 

Because a short-sale requires lender approval since the lender has to write-off some part of the original loan, your offer goes into some pile at the lender for some person to review and get back to you. Likely, you aren't the only offer because there are a lot of short-sales at the moment. Thus, you might wait weeks before the lender gives you an yes or no of an offer or re-offer. 

So, its the lender who has to agree to the terms). So, now the offer goes to the lender for approval. In that time, you hire an home inspector to look over the place and the inspector discovers that most of the appliances are bad and the water heater has to be replace at a total cost of $2K. At that point, if your original offer is accepted by the lender, it is very hard to even negotiate a $2K discount. Basically, you'd have to withdrawal your original offer and make a new one for $198K

Tip 8: Find a good home inspector (certified

A home inspection in Southern California runs anywhere between $250 - $350. It isn't cheap

Note: Most inspectors will give you a report and in it, that's not very helpful information, but due to lawsuits, inspectors have gotten more and more ""conversative"" about the advice they'd give. Thus, find an inspector who is willing to do everything by the books, but also speak to you freely and offer advice on the property.

The previous tenants were a very very good lesson in who not to rent to, escrow, with about $50 left over. We found them quickly with the help of a leasing agent. 

The house is currently worth around 155k, Interest is $577, escrow is $430.  If I sell the stock, I'd pay 15% CGT, but immediately start getting $698 as income without having to also pay it back out as interest.  Of course we still pay tax on that...

EDIT - Are there any legal or tax reasons that paying off the house would be imprudent?  I know I should have the house under a LLC (don't) but would the fact that the house is not owned by a bank be a problem?

We first found a neighborhood we loved with good schools and homes we couldn't afford for the most part. We rented for a year and learned the market here inside out. We took bike rides to look at every home for sale in our immediate area every weekend until we found a FSBO that fit what we were looking for. There was just a small sign in the yard saying FSBO call owner, brick 4 sides built in 1948. We closed in January of 2009.  We have put a lot of sweat equity into it as well over the last two years, dining and bedrooms to discover original hardwoods that were in wonderful condition.  Our home is now worth about 280k in a neighborhood where the market has been very stable throughout the market crash. We owe a little less than 190k on it.  
Things I learned of infinite value to me:  
1) School districts are very important to home values whether you have kids or not.  
2) You have to be willing to do leg work yourself and call and harass sellers (agents)
3) Sweat equity sucks and is not for everyone
4) Get a good inspector! Know what may come up down the road.  
5) Learn to look past aesthetic turn offs, whatever it is that can be easily fixed. Good bones are really what matters.

Long time reader/contributor.. please forgive the throw-a-way account.

I have a rather complicated (to me) mortgage/house sale scenario that I want to toss out here. Understand that the best thing to do is to find a real estate lawyer

Me and my SO are purchasing a house from my mother and my uncle. The house used to be my grandparents

Back in December we came to a verbal agreement that me and my SO will ""rent-to-own"" the house until we are married early next year. when we would buy the house. We agreed on a base price of $600,000.

There is an additional caveat here. Of the proceeds of the house

Priorities: Need to be able to be approved for my mortgage and not pay PMI. Need the bank to recognize my inheritance as part of my down payment. I am covering the difference between my  inheritance and the appropriate # needed for 20%+

A lot of moving parts! My questions below:


1. How do I get my lending bank to recognize that 1/6th of the house will be coming back to me as part of my down payment? How do I include that as part of my down payment?

2. How do we limit tax exposure? How do my mom and uncle limit tax exposure? 

3. Is there a scenario in which the $30K in rent ""credits"" would count towards a down payment?

A knife blade went into the left entry wall 3 inches at this trim board.

The seller has agreed to address all issues with licensed contractors. That would require the bricks to be removed from the one corner and inspected for damage. The primary cause of water damage is due to not having a gutter on the roof combined with the use of stucco panels.



* We are concerned that due to the water damage
* We are really concerned that there may be water damage in the other corner too but we will not know unless it is torn down. Obviously the seller does not want to tear down the other corner of the house since it does not show signs of damage.

1368325039.0,1e5v60,Multi Family Rental Property Questions,Ahh3917,12,5,6,"Hello All.
So how i have been reading up on all sorts of acronyms

There is one home I am looking at. It is three units. 2 are rented for 600 a month and the third is rented for 700 for a total of 1900 a month.

The selling price is 150

So
Then subtract half for the 50% rule so we are at 11400
Says the taxes last year were 2561 but that should be covered by the above 50%.
Cap rate would be 7.6%.

I would be mortgaging a majority of it. So say i get a loan for 145

11400/12=950

950-870=80 bucks of profit a month if i did this math correctly.

To be honest

Next one is a 6 unit in a pretty rough area of Atlanta. Says it is 100% occupied. No other info other than the sale price of 170

The question i have are as follows:

Can I contact the seller and ask for specifics? ie; ask how long the people have been renting there or if they have issue with any of the renters

I'm pretty sure it is section 8. Would i have to do anything if i were to purchase the property to abide with the rules for section 8 ( like a special permit or something ) or does it follow the building and not the owner.

Would i be able to go to the property and maybe ask some of the renters questions about the units. what they like or don't like. needs to be fixed and what not.


Well that's all i have now for right now. Again any feedback is greatly appreciated.

Also

Thanks again!!

EDIT:Thank you everyone for your comments. Still a lot to learn. I forgot about the whole PMI. If that is the case


A few more questions

I would assume getting a property with tenants already in place is ideal but is that a deal breaker if they are not?

I saw someone asked about owner/occupy or property mgmt. I'm pretty handy and can fix most things myself but i am also realistic and won't get over my head so i could call someone. Could hire someone to do the exterior up keep. Am i missing something with that concept of having property mgmt?

Knowing that the current owner of the property is an investor or someone that understands the business

So i went through about 50 properties last night trying to find a 10% cap rate. found two. most were around 7-9. one was about 14%. Granted, why would they sell? Also, is it as easy as just calling the person and being like, ""How much to you currently charge for rent? How much do you spend on upkeep?""

1368239271.0,1e3wj5,Help! I think our builder is trying to bait and switch us,shut_thefrontdoor,14,5,19,"A little back story.  We are trying to build a new home in Florida.  We started talking to the builder in November of 2012 and are getting a USDA home loan.  We placed our $99 deposit that require in December to hold our lot.  We signed all of our paperwork and sent all information to our lender on 01/03/13 and we were told that the house should be built and move in mid-June.  They called us a few weeks later saying that the house we chose was 6"" too big for the lot we chose and had us choose a upgraded floorplan that gave us $2

Is there anything we can even do?  We feel like the builder is bullying us through this process and now we have to choose a not so desirable lot?  I went through our home contract that we signed and cannot find anything that says that our lot is given up if we do not process our mortgage immediately.  There is a paragraph about closing and the lot give up


Please we are desperate here.  We love the lot

Thank you.

edit:  This is what is in our contract that I could find

Failure to obtain loan:  If within 45 days from the date this Purchase and Sales agreement is executed by the Buyer(s), a Government Agency, a not-for-profit agency, and/or any other institutions passing upon the credit of the Buyer(s), fail to provide an unconditional loan and/or funding assistance approval in writing for financing, subject only to receipt of an acceptable appraisal, updating the Buyer's documents within 60 days of Closing and normal closing conditions, at its option, the BUYER(S) will be in default of the PURCHASE AND SALES AGREEMENT and the SELLER will have the right to terminate the PURCHASE AND SALES AGEEMENT and retain all of the EARNEST MONEY DEPOSITS

Since we were not actually denied our loan, they had no right to give away our lot?

edit 2:  Let me clarify this a bit more and update. We were never denied the loan, which is when we would be formally approved.  We met all the qualifications, they just wanted to make sure we were serious about staying in Florida. 

The lot is now under contract with another family.  A no point did the builder tell us that we gave up the lot.  We were up our lenders ass the entire time trying to get this approved

The sales manager at the community would not tell me right away when I called this morning that the lot was resold or a reason why it was resold.  

This has nothing to do with the money, but we chose not to go that route, and would have if they would have told us.  ",,False,,t5_2qipl,,http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1e3wj5/help_i_think_our_builder_is_trying_to_bait_and/

The roommate in question constructed a makeshift shelter in the backyard. No problem right? Well, we weren't talking to each other before he did this, so I had no way of knowing his plans. Additionally, he didn't invite me to his party, bought all of the material himself, and built it himself. I can assume he did not tell the other roommates about his plan either. Legally, if it came to it


So about 8 hours after he builds this thing, deck railing, etc. I point my finger, and that's the last I've heard from them. 


The questions I have are these: 
* How liable am I or the rest of my roommates? 
* Is there any way he could be evicted for something like that? (Pretty unlikely
* How expensive is it to replace siding on a house
* My share of the deposit was about $600, could the landlord just take it all and hold us all liable? Would I have a case against the offender in small claims court, in this circumstance?

$6, and it's completed.  Not exactly cheap though.
 
An additional $5-6k of time and materials to add new grounded outlets and plumbing for a bathroom remodel, add wiring for kitchen appliances that need to be on their own panel.  Nothing has been finished or turned on.  He put up hardiebacker and prepped it, thinking it was ready for tile.  He never trimmed out the new windows nor reinstalled the siding around them.  This all happened last fall, and he wants more money to keep working on it, but he hasn't been in touch in months.  It seems like he refuses to finish anything before moving to something else.

I had an electrician through today that says his new wiring will need to be modified.  He wants $1000 just to figure out what's going on.  There's a nest of new wiring that was never installed at the panel

I also had a plumber out today.  The plumber was completely perplexed and said that pretty much everything needs to be redone.

We noticed they didn't add the phone line during the walk through and had them fix it before closing.  After closing, then out from that spot to all of the rooms in the house. 


After going back and forth for a week, and no access to the other ends of any of the cords without cutting in to the wall and installing a port plate on my own.


That is exactly what I did.  In doing so I found the following:

1. The phone line they added after the walkthrough had a 6 inch cat5 cable that terminated into empty space. It wasn't connected to anything

2. None of the cords were marked in any way.  

3. None of the phone lines were connected to anything.  The 3 total that we agreed to just ended behind the wall.
4. 1 line DID come in from the outside and terminate in the jumble of cat5 behind the wall.

5. 2 of the 3 cat5 ports that the builder DID fix


The builder also ended up doing a number on the grade of the house and put about 8 feet of rocks in the sloping backyard for drainage.  My neighbor's yard was changed to drain in to my yard, and walking would forfeit our earnest money.  At the time of contract signing, we were promised verbally that the water from each home must drain to the street.  At the time, I was very concerned about the drainage.  I can see now that I was right to be so concerned.


So


What can I do now?  What do I do if further issues come up like this?  Would I be dumb to blast the builder on their facebook given that they need to fix warranty issues for the next year and I have to kiss ass to get those issues fixed?  Am I crazy or is their network wiring standard practice?  To me it seems incredibly lazy.  Their claim is just that is how its done

A small house in the type we are looking at is about $400,000. At what point does it become worth it to buy instead of rent? What are some major issues that I could run into that could end up costing me a ton? I hate the thought of wasting money renting, but ultimately, the goal here is to make some money in the process. The last thing I want is to end up paying more money than it would’ve cost me just to rent. 

A little bit about us. We both have great credit scores, which means we don’t need to have money down (though it is advisable) and we should also be able to get a pretty good interest rate. On top of that, as part of the post 911 GI bill, I receive $2,256 a month (tax free) for a housing allowance while I am taking classes, which will help out significantly with the possible mortgage payment.

Recently my dad and I have become interested in purchasing foreclosed homes to renovate and sell.  My dad is highly skilled when it comes to repair/construction, and can't get one for the right price.  

The way we are calculating our offers is basically repair costs/taxes/etc plus desired profit subtracted from the realistic sale price.  Our desired profit is at least $10k.  The problem is that most of the time, finished sale price.  If a house is listed for 113k, and realistically it's worth 98-100k finished, any offer is going to look like a low ball.

To the folks who have been doing this a while, they'll accept another bid, but it never actually sells.  The other persons offer is accepted, then the place doesn't pass inspection, can't get financed, or both, and it just sits in la la land.  We have the money to make reasonable cash offers and they are playing games with people who can't afford the place.  I know they want to get as much as they can

We'd like to be able to get into this and do it for a living, but then what?  It's a nice house in the middle of the hood.  Who's going to want to buy it?  We'd like to stay in the $100k range give or take $20-30k in either direction.

But I'm entrepreneurial and want to actually take part in leading a new venture that I'll have ownership in and gain in the upside of the real estate market.  Real Estate seems like an interesting opportunity as an investment vehicle in part because I feel like you have more control over the project (as compared to stocks/bonds). I still diversify

I pay a shit ton in rent right now living in San Francisco - something like $1500 for rent and a car garage, I feel like I would lose the flexibility in being able to move around and live in different parts of the city; I would be tied down.  Lastly, most of the places I'd like to live, are pretty god damn expensive. I can afford renting there, but buying these properties are ridiculous (I can't see how landlords make money on these properties, they have very low cap rates).  

My Dad has bought and sold properties, Florida, etc.  He's also not interested in putting up a ton of cash on overpriced real estate in SF.  I read a whole bunch of books on real estate investing, finance, flipping, and property management.  This has helped to get the basic framework in place, though I'm dying to get some actual experience.    Fortuitously, and have reconnected with my old co-worker who now has his own company specializing in the entire development stage for small single family homes and duplexes, construction

He basically fixes up blighted properties in all cash deals, additional bathrooms, renovate them, etc, then rents them out or sells them.  He works with contractors and manages everything.  He know's his shit - and its definitely helpful that I used to work with him in the past.  But I'll want to review his past work and financials and do some basic due-dilligence to make sure everythings ok. But at the very least, I feel like its smarter to partner with him then to just go in on real estate investing just with my Dad.  

Here's my goal - to form 50/50 Joint Venture with him.  We would put together an LLC with an operating and financing agreement in place; My Dad would sell me 25% ownership in the LLC as a 30-year loan with mortgage-level interest and have me actively manage the property.  He would put in 25% equity.  This puts Dad and Son at 50%.  Then the JV Partner puts up his 50% cash.  This would be primarily a passive investment for my Dad as he already owns his own company and is busy with other things.  He just wants a better ROI then what the banks giving him.   But me and the other business partner would jointly manage it.  The business partner is providing his technical know-how

In a way, your getting some upside to improvements, and then the possibility of appreciation if they become rental properties in up-and-coming neighborhoods.  Then me being in my 20's can move around as I please, I don't need to feel stuck living in one place.

My work schedule is flexible

I live in a 1 bed apartment and pay about $650 for rent and water.  It has recently come to my attention that this might be a decent time to buy

In my city it looks like you can get a pretty decent condo for $75k. I'm looking at two right now that are $79k. Good location, a 30 yr mortgage at 3.7% with taxes and all would be about $400/mo, and condo fees about $125/mo. So all in the monthly payment is about $525.

Now, I'm saving $5600 there.  So over 10 years, not even looking at the value of the property or any equity built, I'm breaking even vs. renting (because I'm saving $15k by having a lower monthly pmt than my rent and $5.6k by interest deductions, while my down payment would be about $20k).

So the question is could I get a better return over 10 years on that $20k down payment elsewhere.  Over 10 years

Considering that money is just sitting in my checking account right now and I don't think I could beat a 10-13% return passively investing,False,,t5_2qipl,False,,,t3_ot25u

We're currently sinking $1100 a month in rent.  We'd like our house payment to be somewhere in the $1500 area.  We've currently been looking at houses in the $250k range and were planning on putting down somewhere around 5%.

So... taking all those numbers into account

**Edit**:  Okay

I've talked with a loan broker in the past and this is what she came up with:

10% down would take $33k to close and have a monthly payment of $1
20% down would take $57k to close and have a monthly payment of $1
3.5% down would take $9k to close and have a monthly payment of $1

I was thinking if we were able to get somewhere between the 3.5% and the 10% we'd be able to swing this without much hassle.  I know people used to do 80-20 loans

+The rents you collect and the property appreciation are not taxable. In a regular (non roth) IRA, and the profit on selling the home are not taxable like they would be if you purchased an investment propety outside of an IRA.

+There is potential to get greater returns than you would get on stocks/bonds.

+guaranteed income (in the form of rents)

-More paperwork

-Barrier to entry: You have to purchase the home outright to get the tax benefits. If you end up needing a non recourse loan to buy the property, only 20% of your income from the property is tax advantaged). A way to avoid needing a mortgage could be to pair up with a friend, but in that case, you'd need to form an LLC, which means legal fees to draw up the paperwork.

-If you go it alone

-All the money you have to use to maintain the property has to come out of the IRA. 

-You either have to maintain the property yourself, or hire a property management company to do it. If you do the latter, they'll take 10-15% of each month's rent from you+more each time they have to get a new tenant. It can be difficult to find a property management company to manage just a single property that you own.

-Lack of liquidity: With a Vanguard Roth IRA you can withdraw your contributions and up to $10k of earnings to buy yourself a home

-Risks that you wont always have a tenant

I'm sure I'm getting some of the lingo and the facts wrong

I thought that was all we needed to do
I have so far replied, and I've forwarded the email from the previous manager to the new manager. No word back yet. I also checked our lease and all it says is that we have to give them notice at least 30 days prior to the move out, which we did. In MAY. I guess I should have reminded them? Or confirmed? Or something?      
Am I in the wrong here? Aside from the fact that I should have checked all this before now. Frankly it sounds like an internal miscommunication in their office
So my question is what advice do you have about resolving this without undue rancor to all parties? I don't want them to decide that they'll get the $$ anyway by sticking me on the security deposit. We lived here for 2 years and if they wanted to be really nasty they could probably try to ding us on all sorts of 'damage' to the house. And 'regular wear and tear' is always tough to define.
