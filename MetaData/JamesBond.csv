I visited the Churchill bunkers in London last year and read about Churchill's badassery of watching the German air raids from the rooftops of Whitehall above his bunker. This would've been roughly the same spot that Bond is standing at the end of Skyfall (above the new subterranean MI6 in the old WWII bunkers). http://i.imgur.com/WVaOT.jpg. Eve says: ""I didn't know you could come up here""

And I don't think it was a coincidence that that's where the little British Churchill bulldog was given to 007. 
Just a theory!

This subreddit is growing every day and I hope that it will continue to grow and that soon we will have another post where we will celebrate 10000 subscribers. 

This subreddit has become a great place for 007 related discussions. From the ""Bond Movie Of The Week Series"" (which will continue in few hours btw) to the rumours about Bond24. From the posts about your Bond related stuff to your thoughts about SkyFall and asking the questions about your fave Bond movies this place has become a go to place for every redditor that is fan of the 007 franchise.

And it's all because of you. The fans and subscribers of /r/JamesBond . So don't go anyway

You can use this thread to share your fave things from this subreddit and give your suggestions to improve the subreddit.

Also in this thread your ideas for next upvote and downvote buttons may become a reality. If you are good with reddit's CSS upload a picture of what can be used as a up/downvote button and we might end up using it.

After the light Moore movies filed with silly moments Bond becomes darker and ruthless. 

Timothy Dalton made 2 movies as Bond and was prepared to do a 3rd one (007 in New York) but MGM had some big money problems which caused the movie to be canceled.

So instead of 3 we got 2 dark and ruthless Bond movies.

The first movie of the Dalton Era is **The Living Daylights**. In this movie Bond has to chase an evil arms dealer in order to stop the next world war. Will Bond succeed ? 

The Bond girl in this movie is Maryam d'Abo and IMO Bond and Kara Milovy (her character's name) have interesting chemistry together.

Dalton's first delivery of the iconic [Bond.James Bond](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raplvZFysjU#t=33s) is either loved or hated. There is no between (or is there?). So I want to hear your opinion on his delivery of the iconic line.

Overall this movie is enjoyed by most of the Bond fans (but there are still fans who don't like the movie)

And while we are talking about our movie table let's see the updated table:

 # |Rating | Name of Movie
:--|:--:|--:
1. | 9.2 | GoldFinger 
2. | 8.2 | From Russia With Love
3. | 8.2 | The Spy Who Loved Me
4. | 8.2 | Dr.No
5. | 8.0 | For Your Eyes Only
6. | 7.8 | ThunderBall
7. | 7.6 | On Her Majesty's Secret Service
8. | 7.3 | You Only Live Twice
9. | 7.2 | Live And Let Die
10. | 6.2 | The Man With The Golden Gun
11. |5.1 |MoonRaker
12. | 4.6 | Octopussy
13. | 4.2 | Diamonds Are Forever

So Octopussy just barely misses on the last spot. Will there be a movie that will get worse rating than DAF? Only time will tell.

In this thread give your rating for A View To A Kill.

Also let me remind you that the April Madness final is under way and that this Wednesday we will announce the winner.

After starting the new Bond era last week with LALD we continue our Moore Bond adventure with another mission.

In this adventure Moore's nemesis is Christopher Lee who is portraying Scaramanga.Francisco Scaramanga. The hitman who can not miss. The special thing about Scaramanga besides that is that he owns a golden gun

The entire adventure climaxes when [this](http://aboutthailandliving.com/files/2009/09/scaramanga-bond.jpg) happens (warning some of you might consider this a spoiler).

There is not much to say about this movie who by many people is not memorable. Besides Nick Nack and Scaramanga this Bond adventure is not really memorable (just like the other Moore flicks IMO).


[***The Man With The Golden Gun***](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071807/) is the 9th movie about the agent 007 and is based off the 12th [book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_with_the_Golden_Gun_(novel)) about James Bond from Ian Fleming. 

Besides the role of Christopher Lee another thing that I like in the movie is the [theme song](The Man With the Golden Gun Theme Song). Very underrated Bond theme song IMO.

So did you enjoyed the movie? What about the book? Tell your story about TMWTGG below :)


And now for something completely different.

The table of Bond movies that I really hope you are waiting for every week :D

Last week you voted for Diamonds Are Forever and it seems like you..well....not liked the movie...that much..

Let's see the updated table

 # |Rating | Name of Movie

2. | 8.2 | From Russia With Love

4. | 7.8 | ThunderBall
5. | 7.6 | On Her Majesty's Secret Service
6. | 7.3 | You Only Live Twice
7. | 4.2 | Diamonds Are Forever


I doubt that we are going to have a movie with worse result that that. Or are we?

In the comment section write your rating for Live And Let Die and that movie only.

Timothy Dalton turned out to be one of the most brutal Bonds which is either a turn on or turn off for someone. He is a Bond that you either like or don't like and maybe that is the reason why Timothy Dalton is not one of the most famous Bonds.

Timothy Peter Dalton was born on March 21, United Kingdom. As a young teenager Dalton's career path seemed destined toward military service. His father had served in Special Operations during World War II, and the youthful Dalton had his eye on becoming an Air Cadet.

But at the age of 16, Dalton left RADA after just two years of study.

It didn't take long for him to find work. Dalton, which featured an all-star cast of Peter O'Toole, Katherine Hepburn, and a young Anthony Hopkins.

At the age of 22

Instead
By the early 1980s, and ingratiated himself with sci-fi fans as Prince Barin in Flash Gordon (1980).

In the mid-1980s

After his two Bond movies MGM promised Dalton a third Bond movie ""007 in New York"" but MGM got into financial problems so this had to be called off. 

In the years since the Bond films

In 1994 he stepped in as Rhett Butler in the CBS miniseries and Gone With the Wind sequel

On the big screen

In his private romantic life Timothy Dalton, Oksana Grigorieva. They have a son together, Alexander Dalton, who was born August 7, 1997.

From here, or which they disliked. Depending on their answers, you can point them towards the proper ""era"" for what they'd like.

They want a lighter-hearted movie? Point them to Roger Moore. More aggressive? Timothy Dalton. More gadget-y? Pierce Brosnan. More character development? Daniel Craig

Just my thoughts, but from what I've seen that's the vibe I get from them.

1376591224.0,1kfmy9,Why Casino Royale is the best Bond film ever - My thoughts,nafaaan,33,5,17,"Let's begin with the villain, he hates Bond, it's actually one of weakness

The whole film felt to me like it had 'grown up'. For the first time we see Bond *get* his 00 status. The whole film feel's very 'film noir', Craig has his fair share of steamy scenes, but his and Vesper's relationship feels 'real', and she betrays him in a terrible way. Bond is heartbroken by it, and this is something I'm sure all audience members can relate to. The classic elements are of course all there - the women, the cars, the guns. But with the recent films, *""Were you expecting an exploding pen? We don't go in for that any more.""* Some fans may object

Bond is smart, Felix Leiter was shown to be rather hopeless individual, killed off by sharks in Licence To Kill.  Jeffrey Wright plays him as an equally suave, level-headed individual, although more of this is shown in Quantum of Solace. All in all, Casino Royale gave rise to the view that Bond and '007' are code names, not a single man effortlessly killing villains and bedding women over a period of 40 years. He feels, and he's human. The whole Craig franchise has given a personality to Bond beyond spouting catchphrases and outsmarting baddies; he's now a real person with a past and a future,self,SeanConnery

MGM had some serious financial problems after Licence To Kill. They planned the next Bond movie to be *007 in New York* starting Dalton as Bond but MGM couldn't afford to make the movie. The future of James Bond was in jeopardy. And 16 years after the last Bond movie 007 returned on his golden tracks he once was on. New Bond was casted in the name of Pierce Brosnan and the new era of Bond was ready to begin.

Judging from the comments on the other threads **GoldenEye** and/or Brosnan as Bond was the reason many people started to get into Bond.

This movie was 17th MGM movie about 007 and it started Pierce Brosnan as 007.Besides him the role of Bond girl in this movie was played by the lovely Famke Janssen in the role of the iconic Xenia Onatopp. The other girl in this Bond adventure was Izabella Scorupco who was playing the role of Natalya Simonova. Besides the lovely girls we also got another lovely actor who got a role in this movie. The colleague of Bond- Alec Trevelyan

The plot of the movie was typical old school Bond plot. The bad guys are the Russians. Altough in 1995 the Cold War was over the 007 movie universe found a way to make the Russians the villains in this movie and it totally worked.Bond had to team up with the lone survivor of a destroyed Russian research center to stop the hijacking of a nuclear space weapon.

So good plot, as GoldenEye was one of the most popular Bond movies of all time and it made great profit by rebooting Bond perfectly and putting him back on the track. Also GoldenEye was a movie who wasn't made by a novel. In the case of **GoldenEye** the movie was novelized after it came out. You can read more about the movie here: http://jamesbond.wikia.com/wiki/GoldenEye_(novelisation)

As I said many people first time were introduced to Bond by **GoldenEye**. Some people were introduced to the world of 007 by playing the great game for Nintendo- [**GoldenEye**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MfGADWXQs). 

How were you introduced to the world of Bond?Tell us in the comment section bellow :)

Not many people know that she was a Bond  girl. She appeared at the end of the Bond movie of this week.**For Your Eyes Only** [LINK](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf67SPzC3tQ)

**For Your Eyes Only** is the 12th movie about 007 and it features Roger Moore as James Bond just like the previous 4 Bond movies. 

In this mission 007 is assigned to hunt for a lost British encryption device and prevent it from falling into enemy hands.

This movie is memorable for the [poster](http://www.wearebulletproof.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/For-your-Eyes-Only.jpeg) that was made to promote the movie (and few weeks ago someone said that there was Swedish/Nordic porno with familiar poster). 

**For Your Eyes Only** is another movie made by a Fleming novel but unlike the other Bond movies For Your Eyes Only is a name of a novel which contains short stories. That is the first book by Fleming about 007 that features short stories about 007. It contains 5 short stories: For Your Eyes Only,From a View to a kill and Quantum of Solace.

Overall this movie (much like the other Bond movies of Moore's era) is not among the best 007 movies. I'm looking forward to your reviews about this movie.

The first (official) movie about Fleming's agent 007 was [**Dr.No**.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055928/)


The first actor who portrayed the famous British spy was (as some people refer to him ""The Bond himself"" ) Sean Connery. His portrayal of Bond in **Dr.No** was absolutely amazing. 

Connery's badassery combined with the stunning beauty of Ursula Andress and the exotic locations made this movie a huge success.

After that everything else is just a history

With the mоvie where Mr.Bond has to investigate a case in Jamaica about a missing colleague

Jamaica, M, Felix Leiter. Truly a great beginning to a great franchise.

So all of you have a one week to participate in this thread with your thoughts/reviews of the movie.

This movie does not need no special introduction as it's the last and the most successful Bond movie (of all time). 

After *Quantum of Solace* some rumours surfaced that MGM are in bad financial position and that they might not be able to finance the 23rd Bond movie. Thankfully the rumours were just that

The director for this movie was Sam Mandes

**SkyFall** was the 3rd Bond adventure for Daniel Craig. Dame Judi Dench was M while Bond's nemesis in **SkyFall** was the Academy award winner Javier Bardem.  Without spoiling something I'll let you take over from now on as I'll like to hear your thoughts on the latest Bond adventure. Have you seen the movie in cinema ? If yes how many times? Did you purchased the DVD/BluRay? Were you disappointed by **SkyFall** ?

That's right guys we have another Bond movie starting Pierce Brosnan for our BMOTW. **The World Is Not Enough** is the 19th movie in the James Bond series and is (one of) my favourite Bond movie(s).


Again just like the previous 2 movies about 007 Pierce Brosnan is playing the role of Bond and Judy Dench is portraying Bond's boss M.

Without spoiling anything for those who haven't seen the movie I'll say that Bond in **The World Is Not Enough** uncovers a nuclear plot when he protects Elektra King an oil heiress (who is played by the lovely Sophie Marceau) from her former kidnapper Renard

Bond in this movie gets not one but 2 Bond girls as Denise Richards is playing Dr. Christmas Jones. Also in this movie we witness the last appearance of Q played by Desmond Llewelyn. Will Q get an replacement? Will Bond save the world? Will he seduce both Elektra and Christmas ? Does Christmas comes once a year? Can Renard feel pain? Can he be stopped? 

The answers too all these and more questions can be find in **The Worlds Is Not Enough**.

Fun fact: **The World Is Not Enough** or on latin : **Orbis Non Sufficit** is the family motto of the Bond family. This is first mentioned in the movie *On Her Majesty's Secret Service*.

Let us start again:

[**The Spy Who Loved Me**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy-c8aAntWA) is our next BMOTW. 

And Roger Moore is in another adventure

In this adventure James Bond has to investigate the hijacking of Russian and British submarines. This will lead to KGB sending their best agent to work together with Bond. It is Agent XXX. No

[**The Spy Who Loved Me**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spy_Who_Loved_Me_(novel)) is another Bond movie based on the Ian Fleming's novels about James Bond. This novel is not counted as one of Fleming's best novel by some people but I would still recommend reading it


And now it is time for the results of the last week.

So LALD finished at the 7th place so far. The next movie for you to give your ratings is The Man With The Golden Gun so please in the comments give your ratings for that movie only. (judging by the thread from last week i think that DAF might not be the last place)


Also If you noticed we are trying to change the upvote and downvote buttons on the thread. So if you are good with reddit CSS message the MODs with a pic you think that will be good to be used as a downvote button. (and other stuff you think that will help us).

Them getting away from the city and potential traps makes sense to me. The home alone thing did seem kinda weird at first, and M were facing

The whole movie questioned the legitimacy of the role Bond plays in the world. Bond goes through a dying and rising at the very beginning of the movie, but the comeback is actually personal vindication (and I think awesome for Dench's last Bond movie...Bond really does care about M.) 

Keep in mind that the hearing isn't about M either; MI6 and M and Bond are ALL on trial. Bond's role isn't the only one being questioned. M basically says that wars are no longer fought in the open (so very fitting for modern times. It's true!) they are fought in the shadows. It is fitting that M and Bond should face the enemy on the periphery of society then. You'll notice that so much of the skyfall scene is dark, but in the shadows. Away from technology too, I might add. There's a distinct lack of computer hacking technology that seems to permeate everything else in the movie. 

(I'm still processing this part so it's kinda rough) It is also Bond's home, he came out a new man. The same thing happens again. Bond is the one to truly destroy his old home, and he finally leaves behind his childish notions. It seemed weird to me that Bond was taking orders from M at the start of the movie and that he seemed so concerned about his wounded comrade in the intro. I think we're seeing a more mature Bond, and the destruction of his childhood house is just a big symbol of that. When M dies, I really think Bond is emotionally rent. I always saw Bond as the consummate rebel (James Dean notwithstanding,) and I think Bond--for the first time--really truly gets it and accepts M with all of her sins. I think Bond realizes he loves her (like a mother) and can accept her for who she is because they are both one and the same. The end isn't supposed to be some big spectacle and it's not about Silva or mastermind schemes. This is about Bond. And M. This is intimate. 
Thus the small location. 

Silva is Bond's foil. They are both agents who worked under M. They both get betrayed by M. Silva in China and Bond while on the train. The betrayal is debatable

And, once again, Bond is reborn. It's another beginning. This time as a more mature, well-rounded individual. Bond is back. 

In the end, that technology can't solve everything. I love that this movie has a message. It seems too many action movies forget they are stories and not just montages of explosions and boobs. Remember that this is one man's interpretation of Bond. Sam Mendes is the director and its his vision, we just get to decide whether we like his vision.

Following the huge success that *GoldenEye* bought to the *""rebooted""* Bond franchise MGM wanted to build on that success by making another well received movie. Sadly they failed. This movie for some of the fans is a movie that had the potential to be something big but in the end this Bond flick is one of the more forgettable 007 movies. Brosnan is pretty good as Bond as usual but this movie (much like Brosnan's entire run as Bond) fails to bring the spotlight to Brosnan's performance as Bond. The lackluster script

This time there will be no rankings or numbers. All you have to do is have your say about the actors that portrayed 007. Did you think that they were right for the choice ? Do you think that they portrayed their own version of Bond or where they closer to Fleming's Bond. Who would you cast as Bond instead of the Bond actor of the week ? Did you liked his movies ? Do you like him as an actor ? etc. etc.

Our first Bond of the week is the most iconic Bond

Sean Connery was born on August 25, he was cast in numerous films and television programs, but he gets his breakthrough in the early 1960s where he gets the role of the agent known as James Bond. Sean was supposed to play the role of 007 in the ecranisation of Ian Fleming's novel ""Dr.No"". Sean was lucky to get this role cause many actors were considered for the role but in the end Mr. Connery became Bond.James Bond.

For MGM and Mr. Broccoli Sean was good choice for 007. And they definitely did not made a mistake in casting the man from Scotland as the most suave agent of them all. Sean was not only suave on but he was also suave off the screen. For example as a true gentleman he decided to help the young and a little bit scared Nordic beauty known as Ursula Anders to get more comfortable for the role.

In the beginning noone expected that the ""Dr.No"" will be a beginning of a phenomena that will go on for the next 50 years and it will be inspiration for millions around the world.

The success of the James Bond movies huge so it's obvious that Sean Connery reprised the role that bought him world fame 4 more (official movies) times. After ""Dr. No"" he was Bond in ""Thunderball""

After this movie Sean's adventure as Bond ended forever, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, The Hunt for Red October, Highlander, Murder on the Orient Express, Dragonheart

In his acting career he has won the biggest acting award- the Academy Award (for ""The Untouchables""

Sean Connery was knighted in July 2000 thus becoming ""Sir"" Sean Connery.

The other titles that Connery has won feature:
""The Greatest Living Scot"" (won a poll) and ""Scotland's Greatest Living National Treasure"".In 1989, he was voted ""Sexiest Man of the Century"".

So there you go. The first Bond actor of this new series. What do you think of the man who started the party called Bond, person ? Do you think that MGM made the right choice ? Would Bond be as big as he is today if Connery wasn't Bond in ""Dr. No""?  And most importantly: Do you like this new series?

1366568603.0,1ct83x,"With all the talk about Bond post-Daniel Craig after the next two films, I wondered what other fans think of what seems to be the big talking point. Should there be -- does there need to be -- a black James Bond?",nutsocharles,40,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1ct83x/with_all_the_talk_about_bond_postdaniel_craig/, but I believe there are a few unforeseen perils that might come up. Of course it's dangerous ground to discuss the cons of a black Bond because it opens the door to people who would oppose the idea simply out of racism. I don't oppose the idea of a black actor taking the role out of prejudice

One aspect that strikes me is how being black would affect who James Bond is. There are a number of great actors who could don the tux, and the simple truth is that Fleming, and his alter ego Bond, came from a family life and background that few black people living in England would share. However, Bond is also described as having black hair, a trait Daniel Craig does not have, so there is precedent for reinterpreting the model of Bond, so perhaps scrapping Bond's back story and focusing on who he is and what he does would be more fitting and compelling.

Another issue to be dealt with is the bad side of Bond. While he may be the ultimate good guy, but Bond's good qualities have always been tempered by womanizing, drinking, smoking, and generally being a bit of a dick. We love him because he's OUR asshole, but he is an asshole. A big positive of a black James Bond is that it gives black kids a direct connection to an archetypal hero they haven't had before, but the characterization needs to be handled carefully to ensure that Bond's negative actions remain associated with who the character is and not with his race. 

Bond's skin color is never a question in the world created by Ian Fleming. In the original novels Bond views ""negroes"" (in his language) as something apart from the world he occupies. That reality has been altered in our time and in English society today blacks and whites live in the same neighborhoods, marry and have children. England has more minorities in greater numbers, and for American and global audiences the world is a less Anglo- or Caucasian-centered place. Cultures continue to shift to accepting any person in roles previously restricted to white men. And James Bond remains a popular part of global culture, with the promise of a long continuing future. In that light it becomes inevitable that Bond will change to reflect the modern world, and it seems to me that change should be both embraced and grappled with sooner rather than later. I don't know if the next James Bond needs to be black, but I would say that Bond cannot always be white. Making the move with the next portrayal may be the most sensible. But that actor, whomever he might be, to prevent any sense that the decision was a mistake and to establish that the role remains that of 007, with Bonds of Indian and West Indian descent; the latter could make for a very interesting tack with Bond's history in Jamaica. So long as the martinis flow and a suave assassin fires a bullet into a gun barrel before saving the world,self

This movie is the 2nd (and last) 007 movie with Dalton portraying the iconic spy. This might be the movie that I've seen the most times

Licence To Kill is one of the most brutal 007 movies made

In this movie Bond loses his licence to kill

In this movie we get 2 Bond girls- Pam Bouvier (portrayed by Carey Lowell) and Lupe (portrayed by Talisa Soto).Robert Davi portrays one of the better Bond villains in the name of Franz Sanchez. In **Licence To Kill** we also witness the beginning of the blockbuster career of Benicio Del Toro (his second movie role in his career).

Overall **Licence To Kill** is positively received by the Bond fans worldwide. It's the second Dalton 007 movie and the last Bond movie for a while. But happily the financial problems got resolved and we still have Bond movies after **Licence To Kill**.

So what did you think of [the007 movie to get novelization after its  release?](http://jamesbond.wikia.com/wiki/Licence_to_Kill_(novelisation)) (add ) at the end of the link)

And before you start typing your review of the movie let me remind you that it's time to reveal the result you gave to A View To A Kill:

  # |Rating | Name of Movie
:--|:--:|--:
1. | 9.2 | GoldFinger 
2. | 8.2 | From Russia With Love
3. | 8.2 | The Spy Who Loved Me
4. | 8.2 | Dr.No
5. | 8.0 | For Your Eyes Only
6. | 7.8 | ThunderBall
7. | 7.6 | On Her Majesty's Secret Service
8. | 7.3 | You Only Live Twice
9. | 7.2 | Live And Let Die
10. | 6.2 | The Man With The Golden Gun
11. | 5.6 | A View To A Kill
12. |5.1 |MoonRaker
13. | 4.6 | Octopussy
14. | 4.2 | Diamonds Are Forever

So AVTAK is placed on the 11th place. It could be worse but it could be a lot better for Moore's last showing as Bond.

Now let's see what you think of Dalton.

But as we all know that didn't happen MGM got out of their problems and Bond is still alive and doing great.

In this Bond adventure Roger Moore has to make a investigation on horse races which eventually leads him to one of IMO better Bond villains. Max Zorin. Max Zorin (Christopher Walken) is the reason I like this movie and I think that it is really underrated. In this thread we will find out if you share my opinion.

Max Zorin as an eccentric millionaire he is has an eccentric henchmen. Grace Jones who portrays the role of May Day in this movie.She is far from being your typical Bond girl and she is real danger for James Bond.

Just like FYEO this movie is based on a short story series about James Bond. The name of the novel is ""For Your Eyes Only"" and it contains 5 short stories

Have you read this Bond novel? What do you think about the short stories ?

Also another thing you can do in this thread is to rate Octopussy and give your review for A View To A Kill. 

And now let's see how you've rated For Your Eyes Only.

 # |Rating | Name of Movie
:--|:--:|--:
1. | 9.2 | GoldFinger 
2. | 8.2 | From Russia With Love
3. | 8.2 | The Spy Who Loved Me

9. | 7.2 | Live And Let Die
10. | 6.2 | The Man With The Golden Gun
11. |5.1 |MoonRaker
12. | 4.2 | Diamonds Are Forever

FYEO makes a (IMO surprising) result of pure 8 which rates him at the 5th place in our table.

Also let me remind you to vote in the [April madness](http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1cjs9j/april_madness_semifinal/) tournament if you haven't already.

Give your rating for Octopussy in the comment section and your review for AVTAK.

Personally, which was fantastic! I only wish there could have been a little more freedom in the controls (jumping etc) and level design (it's a bit linear some times). But maybe I'm just dreaming of a sandbox-style Bond game with multiple paths to the same objective. A guy can dream...

The story was one of the strongest parts in my opinion, but then I went back and found out that he was actually a fairly consistent contributor to the Bond games, having done *Everything or Nothing*, *From Russia With Love* and *Goldeneye Reloaded*. Still, I like that a actual Bond writer had done it and it helped give the whole thing a more Bondian feel.

At first I could swear they were going to use Greco from the pre-titles sequence the villain throughout the entire game but I'm glad they didn't do that. It would have been pretty predictable. But the villain isn't exactly the game's strongest point anyway. There are a few twists and turns in the plot involving who the villain is. At first it's pays off with what I though was gonna be the ending; after killing Pomerov. It lead me to get a bit annoyed with the game for being ridiculously short only to have it keep going and leave me pleasantly satisfied with falling for the twist. Then it happens a second time with Rak but the payoff is no where near as gratifying. I think we all saw Nicole being a villain coming pretty early on. **Then** it turns out that Nicole isn't even the the one behind everything and it ends pretty suddenly after that. It's a cool cliffhanger but

It was because of this, because I was never a fan of Licence to Kill which I owned in a VHS box set. I actually thought Timothy Dalton wasn't a good Bond because of it. I finally got a copy of The Living Daylights and watched it. 
I was wrong, but its one of the greatest actions films of the 1980's. Its storyline is more then a Bond film, its a current events film of the 1980. With the beginning of the exiles of Soviets in the late 1980's and the weapon smuggling into Afghanistan by the west. Its storyline is the most real world James Bond film that has ever been written, minus the cello case down the ski hill.     
After viewing it, because it is caught in between trying to be a realistic Bond and the goofy Bond that Moore had created. It seem to me, that its a transition story and development of the James Bond character start with a goofy for fun Bond, but become what James Bond should be in the 1980's.

So the era of Connery is over. Lazenby had problems negotiating for new contract and we're in a situation where a new Bond is needed. That new Bond is Roger Moore. In the end he will end up having the most Bond movies played by any actor. IMO This wasn't the best move cause I never liked Moore's 007 movies for Bond himself. Anyway


[**Live And Let Die**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070328/)  is the 8th (official) 007 movie.  In this mission Bond has to stop a heroin magnate. But the mission is not that easy as the mission will eventually lead Bond to meet some serious opponents in the name of Baron Samedi and Kananga. Also in this movie Bond' love interest is the lovely Jane Seymour who plays the role of young gullible girl who can tell you your future with the help of tarot cards (or so she thinks). 

This is one of the few Moore 007 movies that I like cause it is nice to see Bond in a mission like this

[**Live And Let Die**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_and_Let_Die_(novel)) just like the other previous official Bond movies is based on a novel from Ian Fleming. [**Live And Let Die**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_and_Let_Die_(film)) was the second novel about the agent 007 by Ian Fleming.

1371515206.0,1gjx96,Bond Movie of the Week: Quantum of Solace (2008),SinatraFan77,27,12,23,"Hey guys

Quantum of Solace is the second of Daniel Craig's foray into being the super spy we all know and love. Quantum of Solace story, members of the group called Quantum who were responsible for Vesper Lynd's death in Casino Royale. Bond believes that Greene is after the country of Bolivia's oil [though that is not correct, he is actually after the country's water supply so that he can sell it to the highest bidder, and is also attempting a coup in the country. HOW DEVIOUS!! ](/spoiler). Accompanying Bond is Camille Montes, portrayed by Olga Kurylenko. Montes family was killed by the Bolivian general working with Greene, and her and Bond's path coincide in how both are dedicated to their revenge.

Quantum of Solace is a unique Bond movie for many reasons. Notably, mirroring the most famous scene of Goldfinger and warning Bond off of Greene's tail. Though it is very much like the Goldfinger scene, it is a bit more intense, so viewer discretion may be advised if your young ones enjoy watching Mr. Bond](/spoiler). This movie was also written during the 2007-2008 Writers' Strike, and MANY find that the movie suffered because of this. Daniel Craig stated that he had to write some of his own lines. Finally, QoS also contains an unusual event in that is implied that Bond and Camille do not actually ever have sex, though they do share a kiss. 

All in all, and QoS lagging behind in certain areas. It does however, end Bond's torment over the death of Vesper and allow him to do his thing with a free mind, it has Bond leaving MI6 for a time, only to come back with the words ""I never left"", and constitutes a fine film to enjoy.

This week's BMOTW is **Casino Royale** the movie that is marked as 007 reboot starting Daniel Craig as Bond

The 2 other ""Casino Royales"" are the one starting Barry Nelson as Bond from [1954](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310853/) and the second one is a 007 parody from [1967](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310853/) with couple of guys portraying the role of Bond (see the movie and you'll understand).

So after we've got that out of the way let's talk about the [2006](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381061/) version. This movie is the ""official"" adaptation of Ian Fleming's first book about 007 which is the reason we are right now right here talking about the suave agent with code name 007. After some problems with the studio MGM finally decided to make the 21st Bond movie adaptation of the book but they needed a Bond after Pierce Brosnan became too old (for someone) to play Bond. They needed a younger Bond and they needed a new Bond for the new generation.They needed someone that will help MGM to bring back Bond

And so he did. He was 38 old English actor going by the name of Craig.Daniel Craig. This decision was really controversial and many fans thought that Craig doesn't fit the fit the mold that made Bond.That he might be good actor but he is not Bond. ""A blond haired Bond? Monstrosity !""  There was even a site CraigIsNotBond.com (I'm not really sure if that was the URL of the site) made by irritated Bond fans. 

After 7 years some of the fans learned to live with the fact that Craig is Bond and some even love him as a Bond. But however there are still some fans how don't like Craig as Bond.

The movie did it's job perfectly. It brought Bond back in the game in great fashion. Casino Royale was hit

The movie as already mentioned stars Daniel Craig as Bond, and the fact that there weren't many unhappy fans about the fact that black guy played Leither proves it.

The villain in the movie is played by the *brilliant* Mads Mikkelsen who is one of the guys who in my opinion deserve more recognition. **Casino Royale** gave him that popularity

The official James Bond 007 page decided to make a survey before *SkyFall* to let the fans determine the best Bond movie in their opinion and Casino Royale won. Do you share their opinion? Write your review about **Casino Royale** and your **rating for Die Another Day** bellow.

And now let's see how you've rated (one of ) my fave Bond movie *The World Is Not Enough*

You were cruel to ""my"" TWINE but things could've been worse for Brosnan's 3rd Bond movie as TWINE gets 5.6 same score as AVTAK and TND.

Now let's see what rating you'll give for DAD

I will start it with announcement. Like I said last week we will have a Bond theme song tournament. The tournament will start this Wednesday

Moonraker is the eleventh movie about the secret agent James Bond. In this movie the role of Bond is played by Roger Moore just like the previous 2 movies.
In the movie James Bond has to make an investigation about a mid-air theft. By doing this he will discover a space shuttle plot. Of course Bond will try to stop this with the help of Dr. Goodhead. 

This movie just like the other 007 adventures is based on a novel by Ian Fleming. Many people prefer the book to the movie and think that the movie did injustice to the book. My recommendation for you is to read the  book and be the judge of that.

There are people who think that this is one of the worst movies of the franchise. Does that mean that DAF's last spot is in danger at our Bond movie table? We'll find out in 2 weeks.

And now it's time for my fave part of these threads (I hope yours too)

On the other hand, or would he have gone into Roger Moore's films?

I think *Diamonds* could've been a better movie for Lazenby. He looked like a Bond, so maybe the comedy would have been easier for him since it has fewer romantic/dramatic scenes. I would think if Lazenby had stayed on and had been given more of a chance to improve as an actor, he would have done at least those two films, maybe one or two more, but that's being very generous.

Or let's suppose Lazenby did drop out after *Secret Service*, at least in my opinion. 

Connery's dry wit comes across awkwardly with the overt jokes in *Diamonds*, so perhaps it would have been a better introduction to his Bond.

To do so (unfortunately) we have to throw out ""Thunderball""

Here is my order:

**ERA 1**: (Young Bond)

1   Casino Royale (2006-Daniel Craig)

2   Quantum of Solace (2008-Daniel Craig)

3   Skyfall (2012-Daniel Craig)


**ERA 2**: (Still Youngish Bond)

4   The Living Daylights (1987-Timothy Dalton) 

5   Licence to Kill (1989-Timothy Dalton)

6   Dr. No (1962-Sean Connery)

7   From Russia With Love (1963-Sean Connery)

8   Goldfinger (1964-Sean Connery)

9   Live and Let Die (1973-Roger Moore)

10  The Man with the Golden Gun (1974-Roger Moore)

11  The Spy Who Loved Me (1977-Roger Moore)

12  Moonraker (1979-Roger Moore)

**ERA 3**: (The Blofeld / Mrs. Bond Trilogy)

13  On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969-George Lazenby)

14  Diamonds Are Forever (1971-Sean Connery)

15  For Your Eyes Only (1981-Roger Moore)

**ERA 4**: (The Aging Bond)   

16  Octopussy (1983-Roger Moore)

17  A View to a Kill (1985-Roger Moore)

18  Never Say Never Again (1983 - Sean Connery)




Here is my reasoning… hear me out:  

**ERA 1** So the FIRST era is obvious.  The Craig's are the introduction of Bond LEADING UP to the formula of bond (male - bureaucrat M, office with coat rack, etc...)

-

**ERA 2**  Requirements are: 

* Male M
* a Quartermaster (Q)
* Moneypenny
* Bond is still youngish. 

Because of these requirements, so they *could* be BEFORE Skyfall, but there is a Q and Moneypenny so it wouldn't make sense character continuity-wise. For this era, Bond is basically out there doing missions, saving the world, bagging chicks.

-

**ERA 3**  All about Blofeld and Mrs. Bond getting Killed.  Bond is mature, and because ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" has the marriage which is VERY important to continuity it gets the nod.  ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" caps it off when he visits his wife's grave and finally kills Blofeld.

-

**ERA 4** Bond is getting older and doing old guy missions.  More suave and funny than action guy


It all ENDS with ""Never Say Never Again"" - which we all know is from the same source material as Thunderball.  In this story Flemming INTENDED it to be an older Bond who is losing a step


What do you think?

George Robert Lazenby was born on September 5, New South Wales. His sister Barbara was an accomplished dancer even during their high school days. He served in the Australian army before moving to London in 1963, where he became a well known commercial and spokesman, including a [well known Big Fry Chocolate commercial that helped land him his role in OHMSS] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQxcoGOhnts). After meeting Lazenby while getting a haircut at the same barber, Albert Broccoli saw the commercial and thought Lazenby would be an excellent replacement to the on-his-way-out-the-door Sean Connery. On being called to the audition, Lazenby sported a Rolex watch and a suit that was ordered but unclaimed by Connery, and made a complete Bond package to those that saw him.

The November before the film was released, and that he no longer enjoyed the role as he felt it was no ""based in reality"". His co-star in OHMSS, Diana Rigg, stated that she thought it was a foolish move for him to make, judging by the success and fortune it gave to Sean Connery. OHMSS received generally positive reviews, Lazenby's performance a bit less so, with different reviews stating that his dress choices were poor (who can forget the kilt)

So the first watch through, Vesper makes a deal while being tortured in exchange for Bond's life, they are freed, Vesper falls for Bond, they escape, Vesper sees her contacts and has to make good on the deal. But further watchings make it seems more than that.

Vesper's sudden affection for Bond, but after some honest words from Bond she is moved and cries a bit. As in, that's the honest side of her.

It would mean that she is pursuing Bond to get access to the money to transfer it to Quantum. Which makes sense... right? Or does it?

Because: She is putting in the routing number for the funds. Bond puts in the password he picked

Which makes it more confusing. If Vesper is a double agent the whole time

Which is FURTHER confusing because why wouldn't Vesper restake Bond? It would seem that would be the best way to ensure one of the two wins.

============
============
But let's assume Vesper has to put it into an account made for the tournament, get to a drop off city, then make the drop off. That whole sideplot should check out, minus why Quantum wasn't leveraging Vesper the whole time. Let's move on to a nice wrinkle added by QoS: How is Mathis NOT a double agent?

Seriously, as I thought it was terrible to bring him back, then even worse to kill him off instantly. I loved his sidekick character and thought he'd have been a great addition to the franchise as it was going. They basically had a Mathis in Skyfall anyway. Grrr Skyfall.)


Casino Royale's plot just needs a little tightening I think. Vesper having a previous connection to Quantum isn't as good as Vesper making a deal with them as it happens. And I don't know what Mr. White meant to LeChiffre saying ""know who to trust"". It comes off a little as ""We don't have a plot in mind but this is vauge but sounds meaningful.""

3.  Casino Royale.  I'm a sucker for that Mad Men-esque type 60's art style.  And it's a pretty high intensity opening that gets me in the spirit for some good action sequences.
2.  Goldeneye.  Great song
1.  From Russia with Love...gotta love it.  Best use of the female form.  [Ted Moore must have abused his power as Director of Photography when it came to placing his name

Honorable mention:  Live and Let Die.  The women turning into skulls always freaked me out as a kid.  The sequence itself isn't too exciting

Back in 2005 they announced Casino Royale was going to be Bond 21. At this point we didn't know what the film would bring. Craig had yet to be announced as Bond. With the memory of Die Another Day still fresh

At the same time I had recently just become interested in old time radio/audio dramas. I decided that if the producers weren't going to give Casino Royale a faithful adapation

I was in a bit over my head, written, music recorded, a theme song produced and got to recording lines... the film had already been released. The show ended up being released over the course of a year from 2007-2008.

I just thought I would post it here and seeing what you thought of it. I was thinking about working on and releasing another one...the people over at the [Bond and Beyond forums](http://www.bondandbeyond.forumotion.com) have offered to support, more importantly, I want to see if people thought it was decent enough that they'd be willing to listen to another before I go through all that effort.

Hope you enjoy!

We get one of the weirder Bond movies (IMO) in the name of Octopussy. But that shouldn't be big surprise cause once you see that Moore is starring the movie as a Bond you know you are going to see some silliness. And sometimes that is good. Was it good that time? You decide.

This movie is released as the 13th ""Official"" Bond movie

Like I said [**Octopussy**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086034/) is a silly movie in my opinion. I think that you can judge that by [this](http://www.top10films.co.uk/img/Octopussy_James-Bond_Roger-Moore_Clown.jpg) shot from the movie. But again don't let my comments ruin the movie for you. Like I said it doesn't mean that silly can't be good. For example I kind of liked the clown scene which gets some hate from some of the Bond fans.

In this mission Bond has to make an investigation about a fake Fabergé egg which lead a fellow Double-Oh agent to his death. Will Mr.Bond get the same result as his ""co-worker"" ? Watch this movie and find out. 

Much like the previous movies


And now for something completely different. Our Bond movie table is shaping up nicely. Will Moonraker do some shake ups on our table? Let's find out:

 # |Rating | Name of Movie
:--|:--:|--:
1. | 9.2 | GoldFinger 
2. | 8.2 | From Russia With Love
3. | 8.2 | The Spy Who Loved Me
4. | 8.2 | Dr.No
5. | 7.8 | ThunderBall
6. | 7.6 | On Her Majesty's Secret Service
7. | 7.3 | You Only Live Twice
8. | 7.2 | Live And Let Die
9. | 6.2 | The Man With The Golden Gun
10. |5.1 |MoonRaker
11. | 4.2 | Diamonds Are Forever


So with a score of 5.1 Moonraker is our second to last movie. Which brings up the question : Will someone take over DAF's last spot? I guess we will find out in the next few weeks.

What do you think about the table? Tell us below.


Also let me remind you that this Wednesday is the end of the 2nd round of April Madness and the semi-finals will be begin. Did your fave Bond song made the cut? Check the [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1c2vlx/april_madness_round_2/)

1375720099.0,1jqxi7,Bond Of The Week: Roger Moore,dragonsky,13,2,19,"Today is Monday

Last week our Bond Of The Week was George Lazenby who ""thanks"" to his agent and his own will of having a personal life without MGM controlling his every move we are having a new Bond after only one movie. 

So after Lazenby's only Bond movie this week's Bond of the week will be the actor who played Bond after Lazenby right ? Wrong. After Lazenby MGM decided to play it safe and recast Sean Conerry as Bond in ""Diamonds Are Forever ^Forever ^^Forever ^^^Forever"". But Sean Conerry is a normal human being (?) who as every human being ages (?). It was obvious in ""Diamonds Are Forever"" that Connery can't be Bond forever ^forever ^^forever so MGM had to cast a new Bond. A Bond of new generation

Sir Roger Moore is an English actor who achieved worldwide popularity during his times as Bond. Moore was born on 14 October 1927 in Stockwell as the only child of George Alfred Moore, but was evacuated to Holsworthy, Devon, during World War II. He was then educated at Dr Challoner's Grammar School in Amersham, Buckinghamshire. He then attended the College of the Venerable Bede at the University of Durham, but did not graduate. Later he was commissioned into the Royal Army where later became a captain.
Immediately prior to his national service, who also used Moore as an extra in his film Trottie True. At RADA, Moore was a classmate of his future Bond costar Lois Maxwell, the original Miss Moneypenny. Moore first appeared in films during the mid-to-late 1940s as an extra. Moore's film idol as a child was Stewart Granger. At the age of 17, Moore appeared as an extra in the film Caesar and Cleopatra (1945), finally meeting his idol on the set. Moore later worked with Granger in The Wild Geese.

Moore's first Bond film was ""Live And Let Die"" (1973), a modern Robin Hood kind of hero in the British TV Series [""The Saint""](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055701/). Moore spent 7 years as Simon Templar in the original TV series ""The Saint"". (1962-1969)

Roger Moore was actually one of the first actors to be considered for the role of 007 but he had to turn the offer down because he was contracted for ""The Saint"".

In [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro7vdOMmMSs) rare video you can see Moore in the role of Bond. This was a video sketch in which Roger Moore was portraying Bond before he was actually chosen to be ""the actual"" James Bond.

After the 7 Bond movies Roger Moore never reached the popularity he once had

Roger Moore just like Sean Connery was knighted and now he can proudly say that he is SIR Roger Moore.

Sir Roger wrote a book reflecting his years as Bond

That's all for this week's thread of Bond Of The Week serial. In the comment section bellow share your opinion on Roger Moore as an actor

Next week's Bond Of The Week will be one of the most brutal Bonds.Until then stay safe and Bond on.

The reason why I call this movie controversial is because many people consider this to be the worst Bond movie of all time

Altough after the first viewing I kind of hated this movie

**Die Another Day** is the 20th Bond movie in the MGM franchise and its main plot resolves around Mr.Bond investigating the connection between a North Korean terrorist and a diamond mogul who is funding the development of an international space weapon. During his investigation he gets (sort of) help from the first black Bond girl in the series- Halle Berry who portrays the role of Jinx. The other protagonists in **Die Another Day** feature Rosamund Pike

Damme Judi Dench portarys Bond's boss M once again while the Quartermaster in this movie is portrayed by the actor who got his debut in *The World Is Not Enough*

Another thing that you should do in this thread (besides giving your review about **Die Another Day** ) is to give *The World Is Not Enough* a rating

After establishing himself as the English spy that everyone loves Sean Connery continues his journey as Bond which will lead him to the lovely Pussy.Pussy Galore and the mean baddy Auric Goldfinger as well as the villainous and unforgettable Oddjob.

By many people this movie is one of the best if not the best Bond movie of all time. It has everything that made Bond famous: gadgets, action....

[**Goldfinger**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldfinger_(novel)) was yet another novel by Ian Fleming about the agent that everybody loves. This novel later became a very successful movie with the same name-  [**Goldfinger**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058150/). 

I can say many things about Goldfinger

Which movie(s) in the series have you all watched most often, just the ones you enjoy the most and would want to watch if you had your druthers.

What are your thoughts?

Here are my picks for each actor:

* **Connery:** *You Only Live Twice*. Most people would probably say *Goldfinger* or *From Russia With Love*, the Little Nellie sequence is one of my favorites, we finally see Blofeld, and the volcano infiltration battle is fantastic.

* **Lazenby:** *On Her Majesty's Secret Service*. Yes, it's not perfect, but I find it still fairly enjoyable. I don't hate Lazenby so much as I just wish his voice sounded different. It's a very minor thing, but the only thing keeping me from really liking him is something about the way he delivers his lines, I don't know what.

* **Moore:** This one's tough. I love Roger Moore as Bond and I would happily watch any of his entries if asked (save *A View To A Kill* unless there was alcohol involved)

* **Dalton:** My preferred Timothy Dalton entry is *The Living Daylights*. It was a welcome change after dear old Roger left. Action galore, a realistic (enough for the series, at least) plot, and the music is some of the best I've heard from the series. I was actually completely engaged in what was happening, which was a pleasant surprise.

* **Brosnan:** Although I consider *GoldenEye* the best of Brosnan's run, Michelle Yeoh and Brosnan work very well together, love the music again, and again, I love the Asian setting.

* **Craig:** It's been the longest time since I've seen his films,,False,self,t5_2rsg9,False,,True

That's right Sean Connery is back as Bond ! Slightly older than the last official Bond movie we've seen him in Mr.Connery is coming back with a bang ? 

Well not quite judging by some of the fans. By me personally **Diamonds Are Forever** is a fun movie. This week we'll see if you agree with me about the Bond movie that is based on [4th novel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamonds_Are_Forever_(novel) from Ian Fleming about the agent James Bond.

In this mission our favorite agent is on a diamond smuggling mission which eventually will lead him to his old nemesis-Ernest Stavro Blofeld.  In his quest he meets Mr. Kidd and Wint one of the less memorable Bond villains

Overall this is a fun movie which is good transitional movie to the next Bond-Mr.Moore and a last hoorah for Sean Connery as a Bond. What was Mr. Connery doing while he wasn't being Bond and skiing at Piz Gloria you may ask? The answer is simple: He was Bond. So if then you thought that Connery will never come back as Bond he thought us to *Never Say Never..Again*.

So /r/JamesBond what do you have to say about** Diamonds Are Forever** ?

So all I'm going to tell you is that [**On Her Majesty's Secret Service**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064757/) has action,a classic villain played by classic actor,it has exotic location, and many Bond girls.

The Billion dollar Bond got 5 oscar nominations today as an addition to the billion dollars that SkyFall got in the box office internationally.

This makes 2012 without a doubt the Bond year. There were many events around the world to celebrate the 50 years of Bond.

This subreddit grew a lot since the beginning of last year. This subreddit is now ~3.000 MI6 Agent strong.

So cause this subreddit is getting bigger every year and since there were not many events on /r/JamesBond to celebrate the 50 years of Bond I got an idea.

Why we all don't share our opinions of Bond. Movies,gadgets....

Since the BOND50 BluRay went out Bond got many new fans

Also there are many fans of Agent 007 who are fans since the early days of Bond (I hope that we have some people on this subreddit who watched some of the premieres of the Bond movies before Brosnan).Those are fans who probably have read the novels and spent their cash on Bond collectibles.

So to live up this place I'm asking you: **Do you want weekly/monthly/daily Bond reviews on /r/JamesBond ?**

We will start with the movies and then we will continue with your reviews of the actors who played Bond,cars,villains,Bond novels,authors of the novels,Bond collectibles and stuff.

If you are up for this I'm going to make some schedule of the movie reviews (e.g. Next Friday we review SkyFall

Wikipedia says ""a commonly recurring literary device or motif, in a slightly different form each time.  The most obvious and classic ones are the ""Bond villain"" and ""Bond girl"" tropes that are essential to every 007 film.  But there are some others that are less frequent that I really enjoy.  In particular I've been wondering what tropes will be brought back in future Craig films.  Some examples:

- Skyfall brought back one of the classics, and many others.  In OHMSS it was a mountain lair.  In the Spy Who Loved me it was a lair that could move.  You get the idea.

- The slient

- The ally who is technically on the wrong side of the law, and the Taliban from The Living Daylights.  Again, something like this would be just awesome in a Craig film but we haven't really seen it yet (allied agents like Mathis don't count, though that is its own trope).

- Tall blond badass Russian henchman, The Living Daylights, and Tomorrow Never Dies (where he is German).

- Another trope is a small machine or invention that can change the world if it falls into the right or wrong hands.  The Lektor decoder from FRWL is the original

So can you think of any other tropes that have come up over the years?  And more specifically which would you like to see ressurected in a Craig film?",self,t5_2rsg9,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1dg4o5/tropes_of_bond/

Sorry for the late opening of this thread but I didn't had much time today.

But better late than never.

This post won't be really good cause I'm sleepy and I want to go to bed so I'll just post the usual Bond stuff about this movie :).

So **You Only Live Twice** (that's the motto) is the 5th (and last?) Bond movie starring Sean Connery as Bond.James Bond. Out of the 5 (at that point) MGM Bond movies this was the worst by some people.

To be honest I fell asleep when I first watched** You Only Live Twice** but not cause I was bored by the movie but cause I was really really sleepy (I haven't sleep for almost 2 days then IIRC) so that shouldn't stop you from watching this weeks Bond Movie Of The Week (in case you haven't yet).


[**You Only Live Twice**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcIl_6amBvU) has great theme song sung by the great Nancy Sinatra. 

This movie is also based on a novel by Ian Fleming with the same name: [You Only Live Twice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Only_Live_Twice_(novel)).

I feel like I can write much much more about this movie but as I already mentioned I'm really sleepy.

So without further ado I present you this weeks Bond Movie Of The Week:

[**You Only Live Twice**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062512/)

But now it's time to move on with the second movie about the British agent.

[**From Russia With Love**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057076/)

**From Russia With Love** is a 1963 movie that by many is one of the better Bond movies of all time. The times has changed but this movie remained at the top.

**From Russia With Love** is a movie based on the [Fleming's novel with the same name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Russia

In this double-oh adventure Bond meets new friends and enemies such as the iconic Rosa Klebb

If you thought that Bond's first filmed visit in Istanbul was in the pre title sequence in *SkyFall* you're wrong cause Bond first filmed visit of this lovely city actually happens in this movie.

So can it get any better than Bond pursuing SPECTRE agents? 

You decide cause **From Russia With Love** is our

**BOND MOVIE OF THE WEEK**



P.S. If  you wall saw *Dr.No* last week I would ask you to put your rating of * Dr.No* in a comment in this thread (from 0 to 10) so at the end of all BMOTW editions we can find the best Bond movie in your opinion.

Cheers :)


P.P.S. [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksjXilVYIxw) is a video of James Brolin having a screen test for the role of 007 in FRWL (he wasn't casting for this role. read description for more info :) )

So

&gt; 1. An opening bank is announced. Each player decides whether they want to accept it. If no one accepts it

&gt; 2. Both the Player and the Banker get two cards

&gt; 3. The Player looks at his cards without revealing them. If he gets an eight or nine, unless the Banker has an equal or better natural. 

&gt; 4. The Player decides whether to stand or draw another card

&gt; 5. The Banker looks at his cards without revealing them. If he gets an eight or nine

&gt; 6. The Banker decides whether to stand or draw another card

&gt; 7. Whoever has closer to nine wins. 


&gt; Strategies:

&gt; If the Player's or Banker's cards equal six or seven, he should draw another card, face up. It's his choice, no matter what - these are strategies. 

&gt; The Banker has a slight advantage in going second. If the Player stood, or seven. If he drew, the Banker knows that the Player probably has less than six, and can see the value of the Player's third card. 

I guess this is confusing

Say you're the banker. You would deal four cards from the [shoe](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRhfC_Oi-7xSTWNovSxzXg8Naa7TQ80f0EJiCSpswRhtQJR_nhY), or tie. There are several different scenarios possible:

1. **The player has a natural.**  
If the player has an eight or nine (a ""natural""), it's a tie. If the banker has a lesser natural, he loses.

2. **The player does not have a natural**  
If the player has a number lower than eight, there is an equal chance of bettering or worsening your hand. If he draws and it equals an eight or nine, refer to step one. Otherwise, it's the banker's turn.

3. **The banker has a natural**  
If the player has a natural, it's a tie. If the player has a lesser natural, he loses.

4. **The banker does not have a natural**  
If the banker has a number lower than eight, there is an equal chance of bettering or worsening your hand. If he draws and it equals an eight or nine, refer to step three. Otherwise, move on.

**The End**  
One all that is done

**Card Value Key**  
A = 1  
2 - 9 = face value  
10 - K = 0

If a score is above nine

So I also have this book by Deborah Lipp called The Ultimate James Bond Fanbook, enough to keep me reading, and she definitely knows her Bond history. 

What I'm asking you is; what do you think of The Man with the Golden Gun and A View to a Kill?

I really enjoyed The Man with the Golden Gun, but she really tears it apart and berates it overuse of ""smut humor"". I believe that she does indeed to her research and listens to what fellow Bond fans are saying, but she claims that fans hate this movie and it's song, which I happen to really enjoy.
I'd like to hear some other opinions.

Also, but the things I loved about it are more numerous than the weaker points. When the credits rolled, I had such an awesome Bond-high, I grabbed my book to hear what what-her-face said about it and she gave it a 3/10 and it's her lowest ranked film. I was actually shocked because this has to be my favorite from Moore's era.

I know it's far from perfect and has many irritating aspects, while weak in many areas, still gave me a fun ride, and that's what it's about right?

1360583408.0,18ayxq,Bond Movie Of The Week: TunderBall,dragonsky,9,4,20,"L007k UP ! L007k DOWN ! L007k OUT !

The 4th Bond movie takes as in an adventure under the sea in a mission to recover the nuclear warheads who were stolen by member of the SPECTRE organisation.

That member is Emilio Largo

The 4th movie much like the previous 3 is based on the novel by Ian Fleming with the same name: [**ThunderBall**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderball_(novel)).

Following the success of the previous Bond movies a real Bond-Mania happened around the world as everyone wanted to see what is next for the British agent. This Bond-Mania had great result as [** ThunderBall**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059800/) became the top earner among the Bond movies for 47 straight years until a new challenger appeared. But about that later cause now we are going back in 1965 to review [**ThunderBall**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderball_(film))

So was this underwater adventure for your taste only? Or will you join me on the overly unpopular opinion-not liking [ThunderBall](http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRqWFPLuzvo_9NBLJeyJbn-9NwF4I_yvlkwNHPmMQghEmyArrPd) ?

This week's Bond Movie Of The Week is... [**THUNDERBALL**](http://bondmovies.net/images/thunderball-poster1.jpg)

Don't forget to rate *GoldFinger* now and **ThunderBall** next week when we will have new BMOTW.

Updated Bond Movie table:

 # |Rating | Name of Movie
:--|:--:|--:
 1. | 8.2 | From Russia With Love
2. | 8.2 | Dr.No



Yes that's right. Both FRWL and DN got the same result but when you'll break the result down FRWL has better rating. Will *GoldFinger* join them with same rating? Or will we have a supreme leader on the table?

1372726920.0,1hgrv3,"Bond Movies Of The Week: ""Unofficial Bond movies""",dragonsky,6,1,12,"James Bond is the highest grossing franchise of all time. 

It is a franchise that has following throughout  the entire world. 

The novels by Ian Fleming, even to spoof the world's most famous agent. Throughout the 50 years of Bond we've seen many parodies of the Bond movies, and many movies that were inspired by the majesty's agent.

But 3 movies will always be remembered as the movies that are the ""bastard child"" of the franchise. Bond movies that are not actually Bond movies. Bond movies that did not had the support by MGM, and there were couple of Bond movies that were never made, but these 3 actually made it).

It all starts in 1954 with the first ecranisation of Fleming's first novel about 007. [Casino Royale starring Barry Nelson Jimmy/James Bond](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310853/).

If you haven't seen this episode/movie than you can check it out on YouTube by simply clicking at this [link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bBnVDj5SkA).

The Daniel Craig and Nelson were not the only actors to portray Bond in a Bond movie called ""Casino Royale"". In 1967 a parody/comedy version of Fleming's novel even gets an Oscar nomination for the movie named ""Casino Royale"" and it has Peter Sellers, Dalliah Lavi, Terence Cooper, and even Woody Allen playing the role of Mr. Bond. I know that this sounds crazy to you but in the movie it makes sense, so you should check that one out if you want to see the ""official"" James Bond parody.

The most famous ""unofficial"" (or non-MGM) Bond movie is [Never Say Never Again](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086006/?ref_=sr_1)

This will be a special week for BMOTW series cause instead of one you get to rate 4 (!!) Bond movies.

In the comment section bellow leave your ratings for SkyFall, and Never Say Never Again.

You can also write your review and your thoughts about the 3 Bond movies of the week.

If you haven't seen the 3 ""unofficial"" Bond movies you can see Casino Royale (1954): [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bBnVDj5SkA).

And you can purchase video/BluRay/DVD of Casino Royale (1967):

For Never Say Never Again just click [here](http://www.amazon.com/Never-Say-Again-Sean-Connery/dp/B00004WEJZ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372726322&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Never+Say+Never+again)

And now it's time to see how did you rate *Quantum Of Solace* last week:

  # |Rating | Name of Movie

2. | 9.2 | GoldFinger 
3. | 8.7 | GoldenEye

6. | 8.2 | From Russia With Love
7. | 8.2 | The Spy Who Loved Me
8. | 8.2 | Dr.No

11. | 7.6 | On Her Majesty's Secret Service
12. | 7.3 | You Only Live Twice
13. | 7.2 | Live And Let Die
14. | 6.2 | Quantum Of Solace
15. | 6.2 | The Man With The Golden Gun
16. | 5.6 | The World Is Not Enough
17. | 5.6 | A View To A Kill
18. | 5.6 | Tomorrow Never Dies
19. |5.1 |MoonRaker
20. | 4.6 | Octopussy
21. | 4.2 | Diamonds Are Forever
22. | 2.3 | Die Another Day


Kind of surprisingly but Quantum Of Solace with a score of 6

Do you think that any of the last 4 movies in the series can make major stir ups in the list  ? Are the ""unofficial"" Bond movies the worst? Is the newest Bond the best? Follow our threads to find out.

Opening titles:

Daniel Craig as James Bond in

Like Hell on Earth

Song by Nas

Images of a man, powerful poses, streams of water, and spinning globes, finally crashing into a map of the world which seems to be made of clay and cracks and shatters on impact, fading into:

MI6 HQ, an unusual occurrence, and Moneypenny walks into the office with a clipboard. We learn that in Europe's major capitols, MI6 installations are offline. Communication is sparse, but two high-confidence reports are in from allies. MUST in Stockholm and Sécurité in Paris report finding British operatives dead, with no outward sign of injury, but all in a rictus of pain, M is putting together a picture. Q branch reaches out to a number of agents and starts a tracking map of confirmed alive, from the movement of money to communications between terrorist cells and higher-ups. To M, with a flashing tag indicating On Assignment. M gives voice to the question that doesn't fit with the rest of the events: where the hell is Bond?

Bond is treading water at the bottom of a well. He has removed his coat and now ducks his head to untie his shoes as well. He probes at the walls for a possible escape, cold and stony in the eyes, and the woman from before. Angelique, the old man says, wanted to be here for this. Her brother Dominic would have as well, but Bond had ensured that could not be. Bond has a flash of Greene standing in the desert, left to his fate and the grueling sun. 

The fate of Greene, to revenge herself and her brother on his killer and to create a universal weapon turning life into ashes. Seawater, the old man tells Bond, is only 3.5% salt, but that solution is unsuitable drinking water for any man. Salts, like acids, are miscible with water, a homogeneous solution. Oils, though they can be dissolved by strong acids, engineered sodium amalgam

Bond claws his way up the slick well walls, he uses a swinging motion to kick at the hinged cutout where the cover bolts on. Choking and coughing more and more, Bond summons up the effort to splinter the wood and worm his way out into the early morning sun and air. A farmer's daughter is walking back toward an old farmhouse nearby with two milk pails, and Bond asks in German where he and the surprised Mädchen are, discovering he's in Altscherlitz, near Leipzig, some 120 miles southwest of Berlin. A moment later she trades a set of keys for a quick kiss as Bond gives her a winning smile and kicks some life into a 1970 BMW R75/5

Bond, and the two men are discussing what's going on when Q interrupts to show M a communique from Quantum. The old man makes a simple statement: Quantum's operations exceed the scope of MI6 and Great Britain. Their machinations concern wealth in amounts unattainable by lesser G8 nations. Their worldwide influence, economically, is far vaster than England's,  as is their political weight. Should they so desire, they could cripple England economically in short order, but find it expedient to their purposes not to do so. However, and so a simple measure will be taken. The capabilities of MI6 will be crippled

M speaks to Bond and they conclude he must target the lab where the sodium amalgam is made before any more can be produced and distributed. M advises that they have a friend in the area who can get Bond there quickly. Bond discovers how quickly when he follows instructions to a seeming scrapyard with a helicopter by a shed. He meets Stephan Suchomski, which Stephan explained by telling him he helped them fix a little problem with the propellers. When it goes too fast, he said, the air goes over the blades and pushes down, and they used a feather design he thought up to channel the air. He took one of the prototypes in payment.

When they arrived at the lab, vicious, and lightning-quick movement. He disarmed the corpse of a combat knife in holster and an H&amp;K G36.  Making his way past humming machines with large storage units he edged toward the back of the lab. A second guard watching stolidly down a short hall also fell, the knife at the base of his skull. As Bond examined the rooms at hand he observes one apparently empty and the next still in operation. An older, round-faced man in a white coat, presumably the lab director, sat at a computer under the eye of Angelique Greene. Bond readied his weapon

The voice of the old man again. We were not expecting you, and soon others in your organization will fall. We will pick you apart until you no longer pose any threat to us. Starting with you, oh it should be quite started now. Angelique has been mixing the new amalgam and the lab is even now filling with chlorine gas. Yes, you should be having quite a lot of trouble breathing, now, but unfortunately you'll find the lab is in lockdown and there is no escape. 

Throughout this, to keep the heavier gas from seeping in. Looking around, he found a vent hood and tried to activate it only to discover it had already been disabled. Angelique had been fanatical enough to ensure even her own torturous death in this building if it was called for. He was lost. Then he thought about the vent, and realized it had to have a direct outside air line. He tore down the aluminum housing and found the unpressurized tube, still too small for him to contemplate climbing. He could feel the burning in his nostrils and eyes as the chlorine gas pervaded the building. He swung up into the ceiling and began climbing along the vent shaft. At one point, the only way to continue upward was to climb by grasping a narrow strut connecting the shaft to a support beam, which was so thin and sharp it bit deep into his fingers drawing blood and a gasp of pain as he put his weight on the metal, he climbed upward from a pit of doom below, then he was on the roof and quickly moving away from the now-deathtrap.

Bond was in M's office, and they want us out of the way. They believe they're in position to strike first and cripple us, and have their way. Well, that's been tried before. I do not aim to lose now. In fact, I aim to hit back. The newspapers may not say it in the morning, bit as of now this country is at war. It is us, or them. I mean to show them that war is hell. Hound them. 

Kill them, Bond asked? 

Well, 007....


To be completed...

Sunday

Quantum want us out the picture. That means they feel we are a threat; well I mean to make them feel it keenly. Now they know we'll be sending you after them. They obviously see it as an opportunity to take you at as well. You're going to prove them wrong. You've been lucky so far

Well

There's nothing childish about this, strengthening it and allowing the shockwave to pass into this Kevlar backing. This will stop even high-powered rounds, though you may feel a bit of a punch. These contact lenses will transmit and receive images via wireless relays in your clothing,  both dinner jacket and formal attire. This cigarette case is seemingly solid silver, but it will ignite if you press here and here; this activates the epoxy within, which will burn hot enough to get through any lock. Your phone will emit high-decibel frequencies until the object in view of the camera reaches resonance, allowing you to break through glass if necessary. Finally, Walther PPK

What about a car? Bond asked.

M looked at Q and nodded. Q shook his head slightly. M once again nodded, with some hesitation, finally assented. 

Fine, air, machine guns, flamethrower-- plus armor reinforcing and leather upholstery. And we've added one or two special touches to this model. Note this rearview camera....

- The rides had a pre-show starring Judi Dench and props from the movie. While Bond was an MGM franchise, the manufacturer of the motion simulators. They may have been at other parks too that featured Iwerks simulators.  

- Anyone ever ride one of these? I remember it being great fun. I was 10 at the time and had just gotten hooked on James Bond.   

- This video: (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UCA4u1dCCU) takes a look at the ride that was in Virginia.  
Anyone know where you can find the actual ride video? I remember it used to be on YouTube some years back
