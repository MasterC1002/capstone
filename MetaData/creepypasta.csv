This disclination saved his life. He crept away from the door and went back to his room. The next day, all he saw was redness.

My wife had been a narcissistic madwoman who wasn't capable of taking care of herself, my wife had complained that I spent too much time doting on him rather than her, but every now and again I had to settle with Marcy
One night, so I paid no attention to her lack of answer. I walked into the living room and saw that at the top of my stairs was my son, still in his pajamas.

""Hey, before noticing the look on his face. ""Something wrong, son?""

""I had a nightmare, before running down the stairs to hug me. ""It was so scary…""

""What happened in it?"" I asked. He hugged me tighter.

""I was walking down the hall when I heard the sound of Marcy humming downstairs. I hid in the dark of the tops of the stairs where she couldn't see me, so she didn't hear it. Out of the pantry there was this naked monster man with tiny little black eyes…"" he shivered.

""Go on

""Well, and another monster man came out of that door. She was focused on her homework and her music and it was dark so she didn't see him either. The two monster men watched her for a while before the second monster man waved at the window. The curtain was pushed away, and there was another monster man behind it. Marcy didn't see him either… so then, the third and second monster men waved at the basement door, and two monster men came out. I was so scared, Daddy… but I tried to be quiet and none of them saw me.

""They all watched Marcy for a few minutes before the one right behind her started growling. She didn't hear it. It growled louder. She made a face and blinked. I was praying that she wouldn't turn around, and they all went back to where they were before…in the pantry, in the closet, behind the curtain, in the basement… and I just sat at the top of the stairs, I was so scared Daddy…""

I pulled the boy closer as he softly began to cry. I gave him a soft kiss on the cheek as I tried my best to comfort him. ""…Then what happened

""… I… I went to leave and get the neighbors to help. I thought that if I ran fast enough to the door

""What happened

He stuttered as he attempted to weep out the rest of the tale.

""You can tell me anything

A teenage couple is seen watching a football game at what is presumably their high school. The game ends and the crowds leave except for the couple who decides to remain at the bleachers.

She keeps saying no but he keeps on saying ""C'mon"" and ""It will be fun, and her clothes are covered in blood.

It was a picture of me in my 3rd hour class. I instantly freaked out and went on a computer to try to find the post I saw Sunday night. I looked everywhere but the thread was nowhere to be found, and no one was talking about it. More pictures started rolling in. Some were of me, others were of my friends, family, and some people that I didn't even know. I went to the police and they said that they would try to trace the number, but they considered it low priority so it would take a couple of days. I texted all my friends asking me if they were playing some kind of fucked up joke on me, just straight to voicemail. Even though I live pretty far from the police station I decided to run home like my life depended on it. I got home and turned on my computer and just saw one file, and videos of them being burned alive. I was going to call the police but one more image caught my eye. It was entitled ""hello.jpg"".

Dead Island, Zombieland and a million other zombie movies and games had all gotten me prepared for the zombie apocalypse ten times over. I weighed my chances realistically, thinking I'd be fodder and the first one eaten.

I wasn't so lucky.

When the outbreak reached an international scale, food that could withstand all kinds of shit and be cooked in an instant, several firearms, a baseball bat, machete- hell, even some throwing knives. All in all, I'd had about 50 pounds of gear in case World War III broke out

I'd always hoped for zombies. I'd always hoped *I'd* be the one who would fight off droves of screaming

No one ever thought they would talk.

They looked just like us- my mother, ironically, I would play Left 4 Dead together with) and the rest of them all looked so goddamn normal. They talked, they behaved... hell, for the most part, they were human.  No one would think that it would start off small.
""Hey

I guess the first one always haunts you the most. I remember watching the ratio shift from human to zombie like it was happening before my eyes right now.

I saw him tear his entire family apart with his teeth. His mother and father were first- they were sitting at dinner, trying to save his mother, but getting his head damn near torn off with his teeth. I'm damn lucky I was on the other side of the table- I hid in his closet, thank god. His little sister-- she couldn't have been older than 8-- hid in the family bathroom, screaming and crying. The walls were thin enough so I could hear, but I heard something else;

""*Ariel? Ariel
I had to hide- what else could I do? I heard the doorknob turn and the door creak

And now, I'm crying myself to sleep every night.

The frantic

That's how Joe died- he had did all he could

Her face was all torn up- half her lip was missing, but her voice carried far enough;
""*Daddy? Daddy, daddy.*""

""Shoot her"" seemed like the obvious solution, had a few more words with his daughter and repeated the process himself. It got me thinking back to all of those zombie movies and video games- there was never a suicide option. Sure, a protagonist would blow himself up if it would take out a big group of them, but they never emptied the chamber through their own head.

I didn't even know the girl, the girl's voicebox had eroded. That girl's silence was the closest thing to ""relief"" any of us had gotten.

It had been over two weeks- they didn't try to dismantle our barricades

It was supposed to be so fun- pumping rounds into hoards of faceless zombies and racking up the kills. It was all supposed to be so goddamn fun

And then I heard it;

""*William? Bill? Sweetie

I could see her ribcage beneath her torn blouse- the gore and carnage told my eyes that it wasn't my mother, but then she would just burrow into my head- I'd let her in with my doubts and she'd have me opening the barricades to let her and her friends in.

""*Sweetie

I hope my mother averts her eyes. One bullet in the chamber always looked like the quickest way to go. This won't hurt a bit.",self,t5_2rkx4,1337964363.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/u460m/sanctuary/

1358472036.0,16se54,A Real Creepypasta...? (linked to abistigmata),hastalapasta666,195,40,44,"Okay

I’d like to make this short, it's about a creepypasta reader who might have done more than just *read* creepypastas. But please read it.

Here’s what happened. It did happen. I know it did. It happened while I was watching one of theLittleFears’ videos on YouTube back in 2010,” which I later learned was pronounced like “Abby Stigmata,” and the video had almost 200,000 views. The story was your average, run-of-the-mill creepypasta and it gave me nightmares for the next week.

The story wasn’t all that haunting beyond the usual “is-someone-watching-me” jitters that come with things like that. The scary part was the way abistigmata read it. He had the absolute perfect voice for reading creepypastas. It was this incredibly sexy and unsettling Eastern European accent

I soon learned that he had accounts on a few other websites besides YouTube--reddit and deviantart to name two--all with the username “abistigmata.” He was fairly popular for a creepypasta reader, and I noticed that he had even done an Internet AMA on reddit at one point. I was enthralled by his voice, and I wasn’t the only one. Almost every single comment mentioned his smug, alluring accent, and I soon decided that I wanted to hear more of it.

As I worked through his videos, of course. There were five so far, from 2005 to 2010. I watched the first one, from 2005, and learned that his accent was Russian, where he had been raised before he moved to America. He was in his late twenties and lived alone. That was generally all he said about himself--the rest were about where he found the creepypastas, whether he wrote them himself, which I admired

abistigmata didn’t just read creepypastas. Sometimes he acted them out. Some were shot professionally, and most of them only had one or two actors--never abistigmata himself, though. It seemed like they were collaborations from redditors or YouTubers or something, because in the credits, “special thanks” was always given to names like “annaxxholic” or “josho417” instead of people’s actual names. Also, notably, no same actor was in two different movies.

Listening to him read his creepypastas and answer FAQs, and it bothered me. Instead of someone sharing the fear, it was like he was making it scarier. 

Two things I noticed about abistigmata, and they’re why I need help finding someone else who knows about this guy.

One was the way he dealt with haters... or

Like all YouTube stars, abistigmata had tons of haters. The petty comments from 12-year-old trolls he left alone. But every once in a while, somebody would make a really smart-assed, venomous comment about, say, his unoriginality or his perfectly creepy voice. Those he would respond to. Mostly the hater would leave, and wisely so. But sometimes they didn’t. And if they were persistent enough, abistigmata would leave one last line:

“I think I’ll make a movie today.”

That comment would always get top-voted and, though, I started to notice something very, very off about that process.

It started about a month ago when I happened to stumble across a flame war still in its hottest stages. The argument this time was about, abistigmata was a Satanist or something of the sort and some kid named “TheJorMan,” also a fan of having the same name on many different websites, had taken issue. The argument itself was on YouTube, but when I clicked on TheJorMan’s channel I noticed that he had a reddit account as well. Being the petty-minded fangirl I was, I decided I would make a HUGE difference and downvote everything he’d ever posted. (I didn’t choose the thug life...)

I clicked on TheJorMan’s reddit account and did my duty, I noticed something odd. It had changed. His comments were all erased, as well as his posts. When I refreshed the page, it gave me the broken reddit page a couple times before it brought me back to his user page, with his name listed as [deleted]. I found it a little strange, but I’d forgotten in about an hour.

That night, panting so heavily it seemed like he was crying, occasionally glancing behind him. It was shaky camerawork and you could tell the actor was holding the camera. Then the hunter screamed, dropping the camera. It was angled in such a way that it caught his shocked, bloody face as if you were lying right next to him. Then the man was slowly dragged away, and the screen cut to static. 

I was about to click to another one of his videos when I noticed the credits and felt my insides jump. The only line was in plain white text

Those were all the credits. I checked the description and there was no mention of any other actors or cameramen besides abistigmata himself. Nobody in the comments seemed to realize the correlation. 

I searched for TheJorMan’s YouTube channel, so instead, I did some digging on abistigmata. I searched all of the twenty or so names given in the “special thanks” credits. Google, YouTube, even tumblr--all the accounts had existed in some place or another, but were now inactive.

I had been digging pretty deep back in the early 2000’s looking for clues and eventually wound up on abistigmata’s deviantart page. And that’s where

abistigmata had always posted really creepy drawings on his deviantart

The title of the picture was “Dark Harbringer, black-and-white photograph of a shirtless man with long black hair taking a classic “mirror picture” with an iPhone in a filthy bathroom covered in blood. The man’s hair covered his eyes, but not his smug smirk, and behind him were a pair of sweeping, dark-feathered wings.

I was preparing to leave a comment when two things caught my attention. One was the date of the publication of the photograph

It had been published in 2004

I checked to see if the picture had been edited. It hadn’t been. 

Then I did something that I never

I messaged him.

I messaged abistigmata himself on every medium I could think of. I even made a tumblr to get to him there. Reddit, anything. I don’t even remember exactly what I said. It was something along the lines of “what happened to TheJorMan, and why is the Dark Harbringer holding an iPhone in 2004?”

I waited

After posting nothing for two weeks

But it wasn’t a creepypasta. I don’t know how to describe it. It was weird. It was unnatural. It was downright wrong.

It makes me really fucking freaked out even now just thinking about it. I must have listened to the goddamn thing thirty times, but first read the transcript. I wrote it all down. On paper, so he couldn’t get to me. And with the accent. I just can’t write abistigmata’s words using th’s...

“You are a young kid. Sixteen, Jordan, you are only a child.

“You’re not a gullible person, you aren’t scared by creepypastas, and you look down on people who are. And people who read zhem aloud, apparently, Jordan. You sit at your desk, typing furiously on zat sleek vhite computer your mommy and daddy bought for you. You foam at ze lips. ‘Stop liking zis guy. He doesn’t put any effort into his videos. He just talks. In a probably fake accent, too. Zis guy sucks, grow a pair. zeLittleFears and Marble Hornets are much better.’ 

“Vell, Jordan. But vhen I come for you, you’ll know. You’ll feel woozy. Ze screen vill go dark. And ze next sing you know, you are being blinded by ze bright light of a camera. You relax. Don’t relax, Jordan. It isn’t your friends playing a trick on you. It’s me. Just me. Don’t vorry about anysing, Jordan. I’ll take care of everysing. You von’t even have to move. You can’t, anyvay.

“You cannot speak, except for ze fear. Ze fear is all real, Jordan, as it vas for Michael and Joshua and Rumer and Anna and all ze vons before you who dared push me zis far. And ze pain, ze blood, ze darkness vill be real, Jordan. 

“But not ze story. Because

The reading was two minutes long, so I sat through and watched thirty seconds of black screen before I heard abistigmata’s very distinctive voice again, even more smug than usual.

“Does zat answer your qvestion

He was talking to me. He was talking to me through my computer screen and I know it because my name is Emily and I’m scared.

And I can’t find anything about him. Anywhere. His FAQ videos had almost a million views each and I can’t find anyone who knows who he is. 
And he knows who I am.

That video had four tags. The first was “Emily.” The second was my age. The third was “Walnut Street.” The fourth was “Four thirty five

My little brother has two friends over at the moment. This alone makes it weirder because his room is the garage at the opposite end of the house. They're both fairly large people

It's currently 3:20am here and this happened about 5 minutes ago.

At night

Everyone bar myself are asleep. Everyone. I check because I am overly cautious at night.

So, fan on and overly-loud cooling in my PC, I'm pretty isolated from the house.  I was just reading some creepypasta on here and all of a sudden my dogs barked. I have two. A staffy and some little chiwawa look alike that I adore.

I continue about my business expecting them to bolt onto the deck and bark at some partiers or possums

I hear an almost wimper then a bark again. I tell her to shut up. After a couple of seconds I realize I should comfort her, turned on my light, fell to the floor and breathed.

The lights are never off. My little brother warns his friends every night to leave them on as there have been robberies around the area over the last few years.

I grab my phone, so I check on her first. She looks like she's been asleep for hours, barely takes notice of me. She clearly hasn't been aware. I convinced myself she'd been sleep-barking or something, so I switched on the light.

I looked around and nothing seemed out of place. Then I realized it was too quiet. The clock had died. Both of them. The TV's standby light was off. It's never off. It was as if all power in the house turned off but my room

The living room where my dogs are and the kitchen are side by side so I turned on the kitchen light. I jumped around just as the living room light turned off. I saw what I thought was a shadow and the light came back on straight after. No one was there and the dogs were still laying there

Am I crazy or what?

I went to check on my little brother and his friends

I checked on all my other brother's

I began walking back to my room, and she didn't stop. I felt a hand on my shoulder. I spun, flung my fist straight where I though a head would be.

Nothing was there. I turned the opposite direction and there was my mum. Asleep

I walked her back to her bed and gave her a good night hug. I walked back out and my dog was just standing there. Still as anything. Staring at me. I checked everywhere

I walked off back to my room and I'm now typing this.

I don't want to go back out there. Nothing can get through my windows as they're barred with metal but I'm still getting a feeling that there's something in here.

1341630649.0,w5uxm,Mr. Widemouth,kloomage,139,16,27,"I found this story on the Creepypasta website about a year ago. It is definitely one of the best scary stories I have ever read. It's a long one

During my childhood my family was like a drop of water in a vast river, but there are fragments in the attic of my brain which belong to the various homes we had lived in when I was much younger.

Most of these memories are unclear and pointless– chasing after another boy in the back yard of a house in North Carolina, as though they were just made yesterday. I often wonder whether these memories are simply lucid dreams produced by the long sickness I experienced that Spring, but in my heart, I know they are real.

We were living in a house just outside the bustling metropolis of New Vineyard, especially for a family of three. There were a number of rooms that I didn’t see in the five months we resided there. In some ways it was a waste of space, but it was the only house on the market at the time, at least within an hour’s commute to my father’s place of work.

The day after my fifth birthday (attended by my parents alone), and most of my things were already packed away in boxes, leaving my room barren. My mother brought me ginger ale and books several times a day, and these served the function of being my primary from of entertainment for the next few weeks. Boredom always loomed just around the corner, waiting to rear its ugly head and compound my misery.

I don’t exactly recall how I met Mr. Widemouth. I think it was about a week after I was diagnosed with mono. My first memory of the small creature was asking him if he had a name. He told me to call him Mr. Widemouth, his eyes, his crooked ears– but his mouth was by far the largest.

“You look kind of like a Furby

Mr. Widemouth stopped and gave me a puzzled look. “Furby? What’s a Furby?” he asked.

I shrugged. “You know… the toy. The little robot with the big ears. You can pet and feed them

“Oh.” Mr. Widemouth resumed his activity. “You don’t need one of those. They aren’t the same as having a real friend.”

I remember Mr. Widemouth disappearing every time my mother stopped by to check in on me. “I lay under your bed

We didn’t do much during those first few days. Mr. Widemouth just looked at my books,” he said. “We have to wait until after your mother comes to check on you, because she can’t see us play it. It’s a secret game.”

After my mother delivered more books and soda at the usual time, as my parents had forbidden me to leave my bed without their permission, but Mr. Widemouth persisted until I gave in.

The room in question had no furniture or wallpaper. Its only distinguishing feature was a window opposite the doorway. Mr. Widemouth darted across the room and gave the window a firm push

We were on the second story of the house,” Mr. Widemouth explained. “I pretend that there is a big, soft trampoline below this window, and I jump. If you pretend hard enough you bounce back up like a feather. I want you to try.”

I was a five-year-old with a fever

“But that’s all a part of the fun. It wouldn’t be fun if it was only a short drop. If it were that way you may as well just bounce on a real trampoline.”

I toyed with the idea

Mr. Widemouth’s face contorted into a snarl, quiet as a mouse.

The following morning Mr. Widemouth arrived holding a small box. “I want to teach you how to juggle

I looked in the box. It was full of knives. “My parents will kill me!” I shouted

Mr. Widemouth frowned. “It’s fun to juggle with these. I want you to try it.”

I pushed the box away. “I can’t. I’ll get in trouble. Knives aren’t safe to just throw in the air.”

Mr. Widemouth’s frown deepend into a scowl. He took the box of knives and slid under my bed

I started having trouble sleeping after that. Mr. Widemouth often woke me up at night, one that I couldn’t see in the dark. I always declined and tried to go back to sleep, but Mr. Widemouth persisted. Sometimes he stayed by my side until early in the morning, encouraging me to jump.

He wasn’t so fun to play with anymore.

My mother came to me one morning and told me I had her permission to walk around outside. She thought the fresh air would be good for me, yearning for the feeling of sun on my face.

Mr. Widemouth was waiting for me. “I have something I want you to see, “It’s safe, I promise.”

I followed him to the beginning of a deer trail which ran through the woods behind the house. “This is an important path, to a special place. You aren’t ready yet, but one day, I hope to take you there.”

I returned to the house

Two weeks after I met Mr. Widemouth, but even at five years old, I was beginning to suspect that perhaps the creature’s intentions were not to my benefit, despite what he said otherwise. For this reason, I decided to keep my departure a secret.

My father and I were in the truck at 4 a.m. He was hoping to make it to Pennyslvania by lunch time tomorrow with the help of an endless supply of coffee and a six-pack of energy drinks. He seemed more like a man who was about to run a marathon rather than one who was about to spend two days sitting still.

“Early enough for you?” he asked.

I nodded and placed my head against the window, I promise. I know it’s hard for you, as sick as you’ve been. Once daddy gets promoted we can settle down and you can make friends.”

I opened my eyes as we backed out of the driveway. I saw Mr. Widemouth’s silouhette in my bedroom window. He stood motionless until the truck was about to turn onto the main road. He gave a pitiful little wave good-bye

Years later, I followed the deer trail that Mr. Widemouth had shown me. Part of me expected him to jump out from behind a tree and scare the living bejeesus out of me, but I felt that Mr. Widemouth was gone, somehow tied to the house that no longer existed.

The trail ended at the New Vineyard Memorial Cemetery.

I noticed that many of the tombstones belonged to children.

Dan could hear her sloshing her juice around in the sippy cup from across the room as she waved and attempted say “hello.”

“Hi, lounging in the recliner next to the fireplace and looking intently at his laptop. He gave a half-hearted wave back, still reading the news.

As he switched between his multiple open windows, glanced up quickly, but decided to deal with the cup later. Then he heard the rattling, as she picked up one of her toys.

“Eh-oooh

“Hi again, offering a half-hearted wave back in the general direction of the playpen. He couldn't remember being this tired since Julia had been born. Despite the loss of sleep, the general frantic energy his adorable ball of joy seemed to possess was contagious. With Lisa gone for the weekend, though, the girl was taking her toll on the young father.

He'd spent that morning trying to teach her to play catch, only to have to rush back home when it started raining. Some ridiculous series of videos featuring badly computer-animated insects dancing to Mozart had dominated her afternoon, and by extension, his. Anytime he wasn't shaking his booty to Wolfgang's phat beats, Julia would start crying. She'd gone down for an hour-long nap around 4 p.m., but that seemed to supply her with more than enough energy to try talking for the next four hours.

Now, Dan knew the girl would already be sleeping soundly in her crib. But Dan took the “electric razor” approach to bedtime: once in awhile, let the batteries run out completely. The only catch was, his batteries were running out, too. He hoped hers went first.

He closed his eyes for a moment, but he knew that the events tended to be half-vacation. He didn't want to bother her …

He jerked his head back up. No. He was not going to pass out before his toddler. Maybe Julia could recharge his batteries a bit

Slamming his legs down to shut the recliner

“Hey

“Eh-ooooh!” she cried

He shut up and stared at her, on her end of the room, that led to the bedroom, nursery and bath.

“Um. Hey, babygirl!”

She looked at him for just a moment

“Eh-oooooh!” she squealed

He frowned, looking back at the rapt joy on the toddler's face, he stepped closer.

Julia's attention down the hall seemed to fade as he got closer, hallway.

As a childproofing measure, and the bathroom at the end. They all looked to be quite closed.

But Dan, then returned to the hallway.

Holding the poker in his right hand like a truncheon more than a baseball bat, and did a quick sweep of the room – behind the door and in the closet.

Leaving that door open, Lisa said – and the only possible hiding place was behind the shower curtain.

Remembering a horror movie cliché so universal it was almost part of the human brainstem, and hooked it around one side of the curtain. He forced it open.

Nothing.

He rolled his eyes as he stepped back out of the bathroom

Now that he was this close

He closed his eyes for a moment and took a deep breath. Then he opened them and lightly kicked the door open. His left hand gripped the poker while his right scrambled for the light switch.

Finding it

The window was wide open.

There was a moment of blind, and he held the poker up and spun around the room quickly, sure he'd missed something horrifying. Then, as he saw the damp floor and realized it hadn't been raining for hours, he remembered.

He'd opened all the windows earlier to save on AC. When they came back from their aborted picnic, he was out there turning on the classical music-loving bugs and dancing with them.

He quickly stepped onto the soggy carpet

Leaving the third door open

The next thing he knew

“Babygirl

Julia was grinning

She didn't seem to be bothered by the bear's missing button eye, or the smell of years of mildew, mold and rot.

Dan thought his face was going to fall off and hit the floor.

He barely mouthed a swear word

“C'mon baby girl. We're getting out of here, but didn't have any intention of sparing the time to fight with her.

He held her with one arm and fished in his pockets for his keys. They weren't there. His already fiery panic almost consumed him

He made it to the door in three long strides

As he approached his car, Julia still over his shoulder. Screw the car seat just this once, he thought.

Keys were slammed into the ignition, overwhelming need to get as far from his house as possible.

A block down the road, arm pressed against his, the hand still clutching her new toy.

Despite everything

Her breathing changed immediately

He felt her shift her head, he felt her arm lift from his. In his peripheral vision, he could see the foul bear swinging wildly as Julia waved into the back seat.

The first time I saw that haunting

My mom and my dad had been through a lot of fighting at the time, and my dad moved to his Mom's until he got engaged to some other woman Paul and I never got to meet. 

It had been tough for the three of us, mom met her boyfriend, etc. It was like starting fresh. Paul was only eight years old, so he saw himself going into a brand new experience. Everyone was so happy, we laughed and joked everyday... Now that I look back to it, these three poor souls barely knew what was to happen to them.

There was this small plaza, and I usually brought my guitar to strum some tunes. It was there where I met my first friend outside the school. Her name was, say, Amy. She was about the same age as me, and we had a lot in common. Amy and I hanged out a lot at the local movie theater and at the plaza. She was fun to be with.

But there was this one day in which I was sitting on a bench next to her

Amy loved scary things. She had collections and volumes of ghost stories, you name it, she had it. On that day, she suggested that we went ghost hunting at night around a small forest close to the plaza. As a fright night fan myself, I agreed quickly. Paul hesitated for a while, but decided to show us that he was a man and wasn't scared of forests.

Bad idea. To all of us.

It was one of these cloudy, but held it in. I noticed clearly that Paul was shaking from fear. I told him if he wanted to go home, he could just tell us, but he rejected the offer and proceeded to walk faster.

It was all going well. Too well. A sudden rustling noise made the three of us jump. It looked like a huge bird had trapped itself on some tree's branches and struggled to get away. We stood dead still, like someone scratching their fingernails on a piece of cardboard. I glanced at Paul and noticed that he was pale. I took his hand, and he held it thightly.

After a while, and get the hell out of that place. We jogged for what seemed like miles. Suddenly, Amy swung her flashlight to an old tree, and with a shaky finger, she pointed to three huge gaps on the trunk, as if someone had made deep cuts on it with a knife.

I thought Amy was going to run

""Haha!"" she laughed. ""Cuts on the tree! CUTS! Like, maybe? Hahaha, oh man, this is gold. Gold!""

I actually thought that she was going crazy. She didn't stop laughing when Paul and I took her hands and ran away from the woods to our safe houses.

I got no sleep that night. What made these sounds? Why was Amy acting so weird? On my three hours of sleep

I was awoken suddenly by constant talking and sirens outside. I didn't know the time, and I couldn't see anything from my bedroom window.

I ran to my mom's room, hands to his face.

I asked what was happening. He seemed really shaken up

""It's Amy.""

I opened the front door and looked at the scene. There were police cars, the policemen walked on and about the place, and I noticed right where they were standing.

It was at Amy's front yard.

I ran and looked for my mom. I sighed

""Honey, and she was... Eyeless.""

I was about to fall down. I felt this weak feeling of loss and confusion. I wanted to ask a billion questions, but pulled myself together. I asked my mom about the ""eyeless"" deal.

""The killer pulled her eyes out. I just don't understand

I couldn't even say anything. Mom led me back to the house and I went back to bed. Of course, crying, asking myself questions.

When it was about 9 AM, but something on the window pane caught my eye.

Something

When my mom came into my room to see what I was freaking out about

About a week after Amy's death, her mom and dad, and her sister, Lucy, all holding hands.

Lucy was fourteen years old. She had autism

As Paul and mom chatted with her parents at the living room

We talked for a while. She replied to all my questions with the same tone of voice. It must've been hard for her to understand what was going on.

""Sweetie did it"" she suddenly said.

""Sweetie?"" I asked. ""Who's that?""

""I named him that"" she swung her legs. ""He was looking at me last night

And then, with huge oval eyes and the biggest, brightest smile in the world. And he was on the other side of a window. And he was tapping on it, with his long, pointy fingernails.

""Why..."" I was shocked. ""Why do you call him sweetie?"" I asked.

""He wants to be called that."" she answered. 

But the second part of her answer was what scared me the most.

It took about 8 minutes to download, I love that stuff. It started up without even asking to install.

""Hmm. I'm going to close it and scan for a virus."" I said. I was at the menu and it was just black with some blood splatters. It was in Russian, okay. So I opened back up and I noticed the menu changed and I got just a little scared. I saw some kind of, odd, pale, twitching...thing. Humanoid in shape, but that was the only thing that was even close to human. Instead of ""Exit"", it said ""GET OUT ALIVE"". I started playing and it was a crappy FPS with Doom-esque graphics. I played for about 10 minutes before stuff started getting...weird. There were piles of bodies...everywhere. I couldn't avoid them, and twitching towards me in the game. I couldn't move. I pressed Esc and I exited the game- or at least tried. A message box popped up and it said ""Could not exit. You can't turn back."" I started to get scared

Her family had just moved into a new house, which was storage, and a back half which was walled off but had a door going into it. 
The back half was fully lit, but completely devoid of furniture or decoration. She and Mark wanted to turn it into a playroom, but their parents were afraid that if she or Mark got hurt or something, they wouldn't be able to hear it and respond quickly. There was no lock, so instead they put an old mattress from the front half of the attic upfront in front of the door, then pushed some boxes in front of it to make it harder to move. 


That summer, working on the garden, and she panicked. Finding the attic door open, she ran upstairs, and saw that Mark had pushed aside the boxes, and shifted the mattress. He stood in the doorway, laughing at her for looking scared, but of getting in trouble if their parents came in and caught them up in the attic. 


Her first response was to tell on him before she got in trouble herself, for several hours. 


They were only in that house for another three years

It all started when I decided, I thought, if I weren’t lugging around a book bag everywhere like a high school student. Of course this meant that I had to give up reading in the subway in the mornings and afternoons, since I couldn’t quite fit my paperbacks into a pocket. A briefcase would have been out of line, since I was working in a factory, and messenger bags always seemed a little, I don’t know
I had an mp3 player, I’d sit in the metro for a half-hour that dragged on endlessly, with nothing at all to do but watch my fellow passengers. I was slightly shy, so I didn’t like to be caught at it, so I’d surreptitiously watch people. Interestingly enough, I quickly discovered that I wasn’t the only person in the world who was uncomfortable in public. People covered it up in various ways, but I learned to see through them. I divided them up into categories in my head. There were the fidgeters, constantly moving their hands, who’d take their seat and practically close their eyes in the same second. Most of them weren’t really sleeping, the people who traveled in groups and talked too loudly. The cellphone junkies were either very popular or just completely unable to shut up for more than two minutes at a time.
Just as people-watching was threatening to get unbearably boring, average size and weight, and dressed casually. Oddly enough, he seemed almost too normal. He had no remarkable features, no mannerisms, as if he were designed to fade into a crowd. It was that which led me to notice him – I was intentionally trying to see how people acted on the subway, and he didn’t act at all. Didn’t even react, watching a documentary about fish. They aren’t excited
He was on the subway in the afternoons. It was more than a month into the people-watching experiment before he caught my eye, I believe, and for the second time on the Thursday of the same week. He obviously did catch the same train, and sat in the same car – in the same seat, even. OCD much? I thought at the time. Since he’d caught my attention so much the first time, I watched him more avidly the next. He was, frankly, expressionless, too.
By the time the subway reached my stop, I thought, some kind of freak. A sociopath, maybe, one of those quiet guys who it turns out has a dozen women’s heads in his freezer, the first victim his mother.

During the summer of 2003, as most online and written accounts of the creature were mysteriously destroyed.
Primarily focused in rural New York state, the memories remained powerful. Several of the involved parties began looking for answers that year.
In early 2006, the stories were identical. I’ve been in contact with a member of this group and was able to get some exceprts from their upcoming book.
The Rake

A Suicide Note: 1964

As I prepare to take my life
Found in the same wooden box were two empty envelopes addressed to William and Rose
‘Dearest Linnie
I have prayed for you. He spoke your name.’
A Journal Entry (translated from Spanish): 1880

I have experience the greatest terror. I have experienced the greatest terror. I have experienced the greatest terror. I see his eyes when I close mine. They are hollow. Black. They saw me and pierced me. His wet hand. I will not sleep. His voice (unintelligible text).
A Mariner’s Log: 1691

He came to me in my sleep. From the foot of my bed I felt a sensation. He took everything. We must return to England. We shall not return here again at the request of the Rake.

From a Witness: 2006

Three years ago
At about 4am, he gasped and pulled his feet up from the end of the bed so quickly his knee almost knocked me out of the bed. He then grabbed me and said nothing.
After adjusting to the dark for a half second, there was what appeared to be a naked man, or a large hairless dog of some sort. It’s body position was disturbing and unnatural, as if it had been hit by a car or something. For some reason, I was not instantly frightened by it, but more concerned as to its condition. At this point I was somewhat under the assumption that we were supposed to help him.
My husband was peering over his arm and knee
In a flurry of motion, it just seemed like a while) just looking at my husband. The creature then placed its hand on his knee and ran into the hallway, leading to the kids’ rooms.
I screamed and ran for the lightswitch, covered in blood. I flipped the switch on the wall and saw my daughter Clara.
The creature ran down the stairs while my husband and I rushed to help our daughter. She was very badly injured and spoke only once more in her short life. She said “he is the Rake”.
My husband drove his car into a lake that night
Being a small town, the story was never published and the local television news never followed up either.
For several months
It took the four of us about two solid years of hunting on the internet and writing letters to come up with a small collection of what we believe to be accounts of the Rake. None of them gave any details, saying only that they were told to leave by the Rake. That was the last entry in the log.
There were, my daughter included. This led us to wonder if the Rake had visited any of us before our last encounter.
I set up a digital recorder near my bed and left it running all night, I was quite used to the occasional sound of sleep while blurring through the recording at 8 times the normal speed. (This still took almost an hour every day)
On the first day of the third week, but for some reason, the voice on the recorder immediately brings me back to that moment.
The thoughts that must have gone through my daughter’s head make me very upset.

1374767363.0,1j17li,(True Story) This weekend in the woods,whiskerbiscuit2,97,20,14,"This happened to me this weekend. I've been scouring the Internet ever since and figured you guys would like to know.

So Saturday night

There were five of us, something I elected not to do because I was drunk but not THAT drunk.

We left the car and walked out into the woods together for a few minutes, but in the dark, and with the zigzag route we all took together we were all pretty lost even before we went our separate ways.

My original plan was to use the stars to find my way back out

After a few hundred metres stumbling blindly through the bushes I realised that this wasn't a great idea. The darkness was suffocating, and I started to feel more than a little uneasy alone in the dark. It was at this point that I remarked that the usual sticky sweet smell of the forest was becoming thick and bitter.

I pulled out a cigarette, and there was nothing. I told myself it was my imagination but my heart was thumping, and even in the shallow yellow glow of the lighter flame I was sure the tree line had changed. There had been a big, thick shape ahead of me, and now all I could see was the twisted straggly branches of the trees.

I must have stayed in that spot, but that didn't happen ad eventually I realised I needed to move.

I grabbed a branch, I saw that there was a large cliff face to my left, cutting me off from the route back to my friends, ad forcing me to continue right. The torch was dripping flaming chunks of sock everywhere, so I hurried onwards, pushing my way through the bushes and trees. Again I noticed the nasty rotting smell, thicker now even over the smell of burning sock. Finally I heard the trickling of a little stream and the trees opened out a bit.

Sitting in the middle of this little clearing was one of my friends. I couldn't see him very well at first, thick and frothy like he'd been running. I called out his name but he didn't respond. I was already a little shaken but now i was full on freaked out. I crept up to him, scanning the trees, askin if he was ok. I put my hand on his shoulder and two things happened. Firstly his head rolled backwards, like e couldn't hold his own weight, and in the torch light I could see his eyes had rolled back into his head. Secondly, when my hand touched his naked shoulder (he was topless) his skin was sticky. Like he was covered in tree sap or syrup, sticky goo. His head kept rolling back and forth

Now it didn't occur to me straight away, and to reach that clearing he'd have had to either climb up and over that cliff, or pass me as I was crouched in the bushes earlier without me hearing anything.

I had his head in my hands, he weighed about a tonne. I couldn't even move him from his position on the ground. I'm not a big guy, but I've lifted him before on my shoulders and stuff, but this time I could barely budge him. He started letting out a low groan ad I thought I might be hurting him. Also with my head so close to his I could smell his breath, and it was that same bitter, smoggy smell I'd smelt earlier only amplified by a thousand. It made me recoil and gag, and also made me realise that something really fucky was going on.

I'm not proud of this but I left him there. The torch was all but burnt out so I left it next to him and ran into the woods. His groaning was getting louder the further I went away from him, and the groans turned into a sort of scream, like he was angry or hurt or something. I could hear him crashing through the forest behind me and I just sprinted hard. I could hear his throaty guttural cries getting louder, and when I chanced a glance over my shoulder I could see trees getting pushed aside and branches flying left and right. 

Suddenly I tripped over a fallen log and hit my head hard. I was on the road, sweating and shaking and jabbering about noises and shapes in the dark. One of them was the friend who, just a few minutes earlier had been chasing me through the woods, gurgling nonsense and covered in god knows what. Here he was, scared but calm and normal, wearing his shirt and shows like he had been before we left. I kept an eye on him as he talked but he seemed normal, nothing at all like the thing I'd encountered earlier. 

We waited for a few more minutes and the two shoeless guys arrived

Anyway we headed home and discussed these things but I never told my friend I'd seen ""him"" naked and screaming, but I think most of them think it was the others playing a joke. I don't. There's something in those woods.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,

“Oh dear

He tilted the box back upright. “No matter

The sound of the audience’s laughter and screams to continue to make no echoes yet filled his ears till a smile graced his face. “Over here I have some rather sharp swords.” He turned the box so that some swords attached to the back were revealed. The crowd went wild when the swords were shown. He made a note of a family in the back

He lifted one of the swords from where it rested and used his other hand to close the lid. He smiled at the audience as he stabbed the sword in the side of the box

He shoved another blade into the box at a different angle

A dark puddle was spreading across the stage from the bottom of the box as he shoved another blade in to the hilt. “They came into my possession while I was traveling in India.”

With each thrust of a blade the crowd’s gasps lifted his heart. The final blade met its target straight down. “Well

Then a tall businessman went by and the homeless guy muttered

The next day

A thin

Cow? I thought. The man was much too skinny to be a cow. He looked more like a turkey or a chicken to me.

A minute or so later

Potato? I was under the impression that he called all fat people “Pig”.

Perhaps he has some kind of psychic ability

I tossed some money into his cup and asked him if he had some kind of psychic ability.

The homeless man smiled and said

“Then what is your ability

1356671726.0,15k4o4,Alone.,Jacob130,108,32,39,"   It was about a quarter until ten and my mom was yelling down to the basement 
""Bye Tyler! Love you!"" 

   She of course was yelling down to my downstairs living room where i sat comfortably watching tv. 
""Bye mom

   My mom is a supervisor at a casino and typically works late hours and since it's just me and my mom I just stay home by myself. It has been like this ever since I was about 12 years old. 

   Once she finally left i went upstairs and decided to make myself a late night snack. I couldn't decide what sounded better, Ruby, laid near my feet as I began to watch some tv in the upstairs living room. I was watching one of the newer episodes of ""The Walking Dead"", one of my favorite shows.
 
   Rick was about ready to lay into a zombie when the lights and television began to flicker. It seemed weird that this would happen considering that there wasn't a storm outside or any high winds. The tv turned itself off and the lights continued their slow rhythmic flicker. Ruby started to bark and this was pretty common whenever our lights would go out; I think she's afraid of the dark. So I decided to go check on the circuit breaker outside and see if anything happened to it.

   i threw on my boots and coat and walked out into the December snow. I wasn't able to notice from inside but the wind had really picked up since earlier in the day. The branches on the trees wiped back and forth through the harsh wind.

   I found the circuit breaker only to find the hatch to it was open. It didn't seem like anything had happened to the wiring. But then I peered inside and looked more closely. I noticed little teeth marks on the wires.
   Something was trying to bite through the wiring.

   I started to laugh and think i was getting worried over a little mouse or something stupid like that. Then my heart dropped.

   The only way to get to the wiring was unlocking the hatch to the circuit breaker. Something HAD tried to bite through the wiring

   I walked back around to the front door of my house and went back inside. Ruby was waiting anxiously next to the door for my arrival. I patted her on the head and returned to the couch to watch some more tv.

   An hour or so passed by i finally had noticed that Ruby still sat next to the front door. i figured she wanted to go outside so after it went to a commercial i paused it and put on her leash to go outside. I opened the front door and ruby began to growl immediately. I was about to open the screen door when i looked down to see a pool of blood on my front porch. At the end of the trail of blood was a dead rabbit

   ""What the fuck!"" I yelled. 

   I thought what had happened at first was just a coincidence. Now I was starting to get worried. Ruby continued to growl at the door

   At this point, I didn't want to feel like such a pussy. So once again i decided to venture out into the snow. This time i prepared by bringing a flashlight and a kitchen knife. It wasn't much but it was all I had. 

   cautiously
   Hoove prints.

   I felt a little bit relieved. A deer

   I made my way around back. I shined the light on the hoove tracks

   Whatever had killed that rabbit must have smeared it along the back of my house before laying it out front. This couldn't have been the work of a deer. I was back to panic mode.

   ""Fuck. This."" I thought to myself.

   I ran

   My heart started beating hard. I had left the front door unlocked.I looked closely at the door and noticed it wasn't completely closed

   I reached for my pocket and remembered i had left my keys sitting on the downstairs coffee table.
   ""Shit."" i muttered. 

   I sat there long and hard

   Then again

   After a few minutes of standing and staring at the front door I walked inside. Nothing seemed out of place

   ""Ru..Ruby?"" I choked.

   No sound. No sound except the howling wind creeping outside my home.
   ""Ruby!"" I yelled

   This time I heard a slight thud come from the basement respond to the sound of my voice.

   I walked over to the stairway down to my basement. I could see the door was wide open

   I grabbed the kitchen knife I had from before and slowly descended down the stairs. Each step creaking louder than the last. 

   ""Ruby?"" I called out. No sound this time.

   I got to the bottom of the stairs and turned the corner. The middle area of our uncompleted basement looked normal. Nothing seemed touched or moved. I took slow strides looking in every corner of the room nearing my destination. My bedroom.

   I began to breath heavy when I noticed my bedroom light was on. I never kept my light on if I left the room. Something or someone was in that room. I stepped closer to the room
   I dropped the knife.

   There

    ""Oh my god..Ruby!"" I cried. I couldn't believe my eyes. Now I knew that after all my denial

   After a good minute of weeping, was a message written on the wall: I'M ALWAYS AROUND YOU. WATCHING. WAITING.

   Next to the message
   I had no idea what to do. I was in shock and awe from what had just occurred. I needed to get help. I didn't want to call the police because they would have thought I was a lunatic to say some person came into my home and killed my dog. 

   Paul. I needed to get to Paul.

   Paul is our next door neighbor who has pretty much watched me grow up my entire life. He fought in the Gulf War and if anybody could help me

   I ran upstairs and out the front door

   No answer. 

   His White Ford F-150 was still in the driveway so I know he had to be home. 

   I ran around to his backyard and went to the backdoor. He usually kept it open and to my luck it was unlocked. 

   ""Paul? Are you home man?"" I heard some shuffles in the back near his bedroom.

   ""Hey some really crazy stuff has happened to me tonight and I could really use your...""

   I couldn't finish my sentence because when i went back to Paul's room, what i presumed to be man legs.

   It looked up from it's feast to reveal a devilish grin. I was frozen with fear. It continued to gorge on Paul's flesh as he grinned and glared into my eyes. I was unsure if I would be able to move or not. My knees had locked and if I attempted to run my legs would just give in. It was that stare

   Finally after a couple minutes of frozen terror he stopped consuming Paul long enough to say one word in a long and unfamilar hiss

   ""Run."" 

   All at once my legs had regained their strength and I was out of there like a bat out of hell. I darted out the front door and could hear the monster chasing me bumping into Paul's furniture as it sprinted towards my fleeing feet. I ran back inside my home and locked the door. I could hear him pounding on the door

   The window.

   My bedroom window was wide open and that thing is probably already in the house. I decided one more time that leaving was my best option. So i picked up the knife and ran down the street towards my other neighbors. I ran up to the Wilkerson's house and rang the doorbell no reply

   At this sight my heart sank. He killed them all. He probably got the rest of the neighbors too. I must be the last one alive.

   Well if this was true I wasn't going to give up. Not that easily. I looked around the Wilkerson's home for a gun. I wasn't able to find any kind of suitable weapon until I walked down to the basement. There found an old hunting rifle Mr. Wilkerson had hanging up on a mantle. Ammunition was right next to it. 

   I loaded the old gun up and headed upstairs slowly. Their stairs were much older and creaked louder than ours. I was mid-way up the stairs when a voice appeared upstairs.

   ""This is the Saint Peters Police Department

   Excitement leapt into my heart. Somebody had alerted the police

   ""Officers! I'm here! I'm right here!""

   The moment i walked upstairs I knew it was too late. Right behind the two officers was the monster. It looked and me and gave me the familiar blood-stained smile it had previously shown me and before I could even warn the officers

   ""NO!"" I screamed.

   I took aim

   ""Fuck you."" I said as i put the final bullet through its brain.

   I threw the gun down and walked back to my house. It was over and I was tired after a long night of torment.
   The howling of the wind had finally died down and it was time to sleep. When I reached my house I saw that the blood of the rabbit had finally frozen over. I stepped over it and walked into my home.

   As I walked into the living room I saw with all my horror Paul's carcass laying on the couch. That same terrible message was written across the top part of my living room once more for my eyes to endure: I'M ALWAYS AROUND YOU. WATCHING.WAITING. At the moment I saw the message I felt something grab tightly around my neck and squeeze. Everything faded to black.

   I awoke to everything cleaned in the living room. Not a trace of blood or guts anywhere. I was thoroughly impressed with the creature's precision to detail. Making it look as if nothing had happened. There in the living room with me sitting on the couch was Paul

1357262883.0,15x8ni,Jailbreak- Just a kid's game!,Nella97,109,30,12,"   *You’re a decent writer, years ago.  It’s finally time to share my tale.*

   *I’m a 27 year old woman now, to be exact.  It was my birthday party.*

   *That night, you’re taken to “jail.”  The other people hiding can then tag the “jail” and yell “Jail break!” to free you.  The round continues until everyone is imprisoned.  Now, I know what you’re thinking.  Child's games at a 16 year old's birthday party?  Yeah, well, this was the midnight edition of the game on a large expanse of farm land spotted with patches of forest.  Things could get pretty intense.  But anyway, the night began like any normal party would.  Guests arrived, (7 of my closest friends, cake was eaten
  
 *There were 14 of us total, two groups consisting of 5 teens, the other of 4.  We then waited until midnight, just clowning around by a bonfire my father had started for us.  The fire would serve as the “meeting” location between each round of jail break.  It was a fun night, expected to be made better by the upcoming game.*

   *Finally, was hiding for the first round.  The group of four was seeking, led by my brother.  We began the game at 10 past midnight, with directions to meet back at the fire at 1:10AM, if his group couldn't capture everyone.*

   *Immediately, so I’d go solo.  I advised the other four to split into groups of two to hide.  I knew I was fast, so if anyone got captured, I’d be able to sneak in and free them.  I recommended some spots for the four to hide, gave them instructions to text me if they got caught, and left them to find my own hiding place – in the barn.*

   *The barn was about an acre away from where the bonfire was at.  I guess I should clarify, specifically, the hay loft.  I burrowed myself into a small hole in the stacking of hay bales, pulled another bale on top of the hole to cover it, and settled down as comfortably as I could in the tight, cramped space.  If you’ve ever played in a barn before, you know what I’m talking about, as the arrangement of the hay bales was only somewhat neat.  No one would know my exact location
  
   *To save you the boredom of reading about the nothingness that happened as I waited, I knew it was getting close to the end of the round.  I had only received two text messages, one stating that someone on my team was caught, but another one a moment later told me to stay put; someone else was heading to the rescue.*
  
   *It was 12:52AM when I finally heard someone else enter the barn.  I figured it was my brother by the stealthy way I heard the door being opened and shut.  I listened quietly as he carefully stepped into the main part of the barn below the hayloft.  There were plenty of hiding places down there that I often occupied, but another sound accompanying his steps.  He sounded as if he were limping, but the other sound, slightly louder than that made by his feet, was a constant dragging sound.  He was carrying something, but what could he possibly be taking with him as he searched for people?  And why would he drag it?*
  
   *I was listening so intently that I jumped, so why would he bother carrying it around…?  The object pounded against each stop as he dragged it up, and I tensed with each step he took.*  
   
   *When he reached the top, assuming. He’s trying to scare me.  And boy, it was working!*
 
   *The footsteps resumed, but it felt like hours.  I remember wondering why my brother hasn’t stopped to search anywhere… he was just walking.  But, when he reached my hiding spot, he stopped directly in front of it.*
  
   *I remember thinking I had left an obvious trail by accident; maybe my arrangement of the bales wasn't as concealing as I had thought.  He knew I was there.  He was standing right in front of me
   
   *Then, too humorless.  Too… too evil.*
 
   *Then the chuckling abruptly stopped and the man dropped the thing he was carrying.  I heard it hit the floor, and the bale moved.  I expected the dim moonlight to come leaking in through the cracks in the old barn walls, giving everything a soft glow as the bale was thrown aside.  I’d experienced it often enough to know it would happen… but this time… it didn't.  My vision stayed black, still pitch dark.  I was terrified at that point, and unable to move.*
  
   *That was when the soft chuckling began again, it stopped.  My eyes began to adjust to the dim glow I was used to in the barn.  I remember sitting still, not moving, unable to move, for what must have been a good 10 minutes.  I listened to every tiny sound coming from the barn, waiting for something to shift.*
   
   *I remember then that I had felt the sudden need to leave the barn, I felt safer.  I could see around me, and I knew I was alone again.  I took a step out of my little cubby hole but quickly recoiled.  It wasn't the soft touch of hay underneath my sneakered foot I felt.  It was something hard.  Looking down, I saw a strange shape, but I wasn't too sure what it was.  I pulled out my phone and illuminated the object.  Gazing down in horror, I scrambled to leave the barn as quickly as-.*






   The girl looked up from her computer screen.  “Hello?”  She said softly into the silence.  She waited a moment as she listened for movement, wondering why she wasn't in bed.  

   Sighing,” she told herself as a yawn overcame her.  She saved her work and shut the laptop off.  Standing up, she stretched and headed into the kitchen for a glass of water.

   She turned on the tap and let it run for a few seconds, the young woman turned off the lights and headed towards her and her husband’s room.  She made a quick stop at the bathroom and went into the room.  Without turning on any lights, she stripped down to her undergarments and crawled into bed beside her sleeping husband, who was lying on his side.  Drawing close to him, she was already half asleep when she felt-.

   “Oh my God, in water or sweat or something.  She turned away and flipped on the bedside lamp and, rubbing her eyes with one hand and shaking her husband with the other, attempted to wake him up.  But that’s when she saw.  Her husband’s back wasn't soaked in water, it was red.  His nightshirt was stained with….

   “Blood, she spoke into the phone, explaining what she had just found.  She gave her name and address and hung up with shaking hands.

   Then she heard it: a limping gait with an object being dragged behind.  The sound was coming down the hallway

   “Oh my God…, the door flung open.

   Standing directly in front of her was a man, though light was cast directly on him, and he resembled the shape of a human but he had no distinguishable features.  His breath was raspy and shallow, and in his right hand, he carried the same object the young woman had seen and nearly been killed with on the night of her 16th birthday party.  It was an ax.  The sharp edge was stained red, and the majority of the handle was damp with blood, just like the night of her party

   She was frozen in place.  The soft chuckling emerged from the man

1354869318.0,14fpi7,Unknown friend,ellster67,107,31,42,"This all started when I got a friend invitation from someone on Facebook who had the same name as me. They sent me a message saying ""We have the same name! "". I added them and figured what the heck
The next day I woke up to a message reading ""What's up?"". I replied ""Nothing much, I had never actually spoken to anyone with the same name as me before in my life! This could be cool! I was kind of socially awkward and didn't get out much. Let's just say internet friends weren't something new to me. I got to Bryan's house, but he wasn't answering his phone or his buzzer. I had the weirdest feeling I was being watched, but there was no one around. I yelled up to his bedroom window. Still no answer.

At one point his cat hopped up and began cleaning itself on the windowsill. I gave up and went to head home. I got a message from an unknown number reading ""Where's Bryan?"". I made a face and figured it might've been one of my friends who I hadn't had a chance to put into my new blackberry yet messaging me about Bryan's new place. Bryan moved in a week and a half before this happened. ""I don't know

I stopped in the variety store on the way back and bought some cigarettes, the weather outside was crappy and I still felt weird. I told him I couldn't make it and he hung up. I looked at my phone and it just said the call was disconnected. I shrugged it off and continued home. I finally made it back from my journey across the city to my nice warm home. Everything from then on was normal, I made dinner for my girlfriend and her son, watched some TV shows, and went to bed. That night I woke up with that weird feeling again, my cellphone was going off somewhere in the house. It was echoing loudly but It wasn't on the bedside where I thought I left it. I looked all over the room and decided to go to bed. Whoever was calling me would have to wait. A few hours passed and my phone was still going off. Eventually I fell asleep.

I woke up the next day with a picture message on my phone. What I saw next was extremely graphic and violent. It looked as if whoever took the picture was in the process of pulling someone's face off. There was a long incision along the right side of the face where the photographer hooked his fingers in and was tearing. It was impossible to tell who the picture was of due to the face that the face was folded in on itself

I tried calling Bryan a few times but his phone went right to his answering machine which had been changed. It was replaced with complete silence. The fourth time I called I put it on speaker and realized that it wasn't silent. There was a very quiet sound, no any strange deaths or anything. I decided to go back to Bryan's house and wait. Hours passed and no one came in or out of his building, it was starting to get dark so I went home. My girlfriend texted me asking ""Where are you?"". I called her instead of replying and explained I'd be home soon. My cellphone beeped and I told her I had a text message. She said she'd let me go and told me to hurry up and that my dinner was in the fridge. I told her I loved her, we said goodbye to each other and I hung up.

I looked down at my cellphone to read the text. I opened it. ""Where's Dan?"" It said. My heart stopped. I ignored it and kept walking, but I had checked everywhere! Every now and then the smell of burning hair would slither its way up my nostrils. I was sweating buckets at this point due to the paranoia. I kept thinking I could hear someone swallowing, or lightly clearing their throat. It was so quiet it was hard to hear through the sound of my cellphone going off but I could DEFINITELY hear something. Suddenly my cellphone stopped ringing and with the silence came heavy darkness.

I reached for the lightswitch and something wet brushed my fingertips

Something creaked from behind me, the tiny curtains I bought for the window at the top of the door were drawn shut. My ears were ringing, I had never felt anything like this kind of fear in my entire life. It was as if it had manifested itself into a living thing and swallowed me whole, trapping me within its pitch black stomach.

I closed my eyes and took a few deep breaths

1. The homescreen on my blackberry read ""Battery too low for radio use"" 

2. The lights in my house were back on.

Then my ringtone played loudly from what sounded like right next to my ear. I spun around and was face to face with something I can't quite put into words. My vision faded into a blur, knees weak, arms heavy, it's falling out of my pockets already  - mom's spaghetti. Before I blacked out I heard a raspy voice emanate from the speaker - ""I was phone.""

I remember certain things that have happened to the world only someone with knowledge of the future would know.

People reported hearing unearthly screams time and time again, finding her corpse huddled in the corner next to the door, arms outstretched as if still trying to find the exit.

Well, but I couldn’t budge it, it had taken four people to put it in place. In the dark, I resigned myself to the night ahead of me.

Now, surrounded by a looming pressure that I couldn’t begin to explain, the darkness itself seemed to try to consume me. From all around it felt like weight was pressing against my skin, making even breathing hard. I sat in the dark for what must have been hours.

Then I heard the scratches. They were faint at first, but each second was an unbearable eternity.

Then, the pitiful gasping of one without a shred of hope left.

I felt such sorrow at the moment, I found myself apologizing aloud for everything that had happened to her. Hell, a part of me wanted to reach out and feel for a body to hug, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it for fear that I truly would find one.

I don’t know whether or not she heard me or was even aware of my presence

I fell asleep at some point, so I must have slept for at least a few hours.

I stumbled outside and went to a small unlocked prayer house. I think previously it was a segregated mini-church, two of them were kneeling next to it with faces of shock.

There were bloody streaks covering the interior of the door, but I can’t be sure.

At first, then nervously glanced at one another. I was rightfully pissed with them and told them every detail of what I remembered, wanting them to know what I had been put through.

Finally, but look at your face.”

I later found out that many times people had tried to permanently seal the entrance to the mausoleum, the last attempt of many through the decades. It seemed like some force was ensuring that it was impossible to ever repeat the mistakes of the past. This is something I am understandably quite grateful for, but to this very day I am chilled to the bone when I think of what happened that night.

When I reached from the back seat and adjusted the rear-view mirror, as if someone had gently cradled my face with torn fingers as I slept that night, feeling the warmth of another for the first time in over a hundred years.

Timmy was a young boy who was never noticed by people, this had later a big effect in the story.

Cosmo worked as a comedian but was slowly running out of business

Timmy was always depressed and crying in his bedroom alongside 2 fishes Wanda bought him. Timmy's parents tried to cheer him up but saw no effect and left him to rot. They hired a young well looking babysitter for him called Vicky

Timmy's father told the boy the whole story without even showing emotions and thus Timmy was traumatized... He was never the same

Timmy had a weird teacher called Crocker who taught the boys every single lesson. Crocker saw how depressed the boy was and tried cheering him up, leaving Vicky with a hard and miserable job.

Timmy was at the edge of suicide when something amazing happened. Timmy was frustrated, this was when Timmy knew she was mad and evil. He threw the ball towards the wall and it broke in half leaving pink clouds behind. Timmy was surprised by this when suddenly two creatures equally looking to his godparents came out, only this where fairies. He adopted them as his ""Fairy Oddparents"" and was once again happy. Of course everything went completely different in real life. Nothing ever came out of the ball but pieces of black marble, Timmy actually had Psychotic Depression which made him hallucinate about this magical creatures.

He spoke in his bedroom to no one every day. Vicky couldn't come in for somedays and was beginning to worry, but it all went even worse. Timmy spoke to no one in front of her, Vicky tried to help him multiple times but failed as Timmy shouted and ran to his bedroom.

Timmy imagined multiple things

Timmy then created a village for fairies from the fact that he knew his godparents had gone to heaven
When Cosmo was sent to the army for 2 years he was put into the troop of sergeant Jorgan Vontangle who was a serious and cold blooded person. Timmy never memorized his name so he knew him as Jorgen Von Strangle

Timmy was always seen walking and speaking alone and so people ignored him
Timmy thought of this girl as ""obsessively in love with him"" when she was only trying to help.
Trixie Tang is a girl who Timmy fell in love with and thus creating the illusion that she was popular and beautiful but always neglecting Timmy.

Still makes me shudder when I think about it.,peace_suffer,84,18,20,"Last year I spent six months participating in what I was told was a psychological experiment. I found an ad in my local paper looking for imaginative people looking to make good money

They told me that all I would have to do is stay in a room, and while I was there I would visualize a double of myself. They called it my ""tulpa"".

It seemed easy enough, then attached sensors to my head and hooked them into a little black box on the table beside me. They talked me through the process of visualizing my double again, and explained that if I got bored or restless, instead of moving around, I should visualize my double moving around, or try to interact with him, and so on. The idea was to keep him with me the entire time I was in the room.

I had trouble with it for the first few days. It was more controlled than any sort of daydreaming I'd done before. I'd imagine my double for a few minutes

The second week, ugly and unsettling, and it made the process a little more difficult, but I managed nonetheless. The next week they played even more unsettling music, punctuated with shrieks, feedback loops, what sounded like an old school modem dialing up

After about a month, or play rock-paper-scissors, or I'd imagine him juggling, or break-dancing, or whatever caught my fancy. I asked the researchers if my foolishness would adversely affect their study, but they encouraged me.

So we played, and he corrected me. I'd said my date was wearing a yellow top, and he told me it was a green one. I thought about it for a second, and realized he was right. It creeped me out, and after my shift that day, I talked to the researchers about it. ""You're using the thought-form to access your subconscious,"" they explained. ""You knew on some level that you were wrong

What had been creepy was suddenly cool. I was talking to my subconscious! It took some practice, or things I was taught and immediately forgot in high school. It was awesome.

That was around the time I started ""calling up"" my double outside of the research center. Not often at first, or visiting my mom, I even brought him along on a date once. I didn't need to speak aloud to him, so I was able to carry out conversations with him and no one was the wiser.

I know that sounds strange, I'd thought the date I brought him along on was going badly, but he pointed out how she was laughing a little too hard at my jokes, and leaning towards me as I spoke, and a bunch of other subtle clues I wasn't consciously picking up on. I listened, and let's just say that that date went very well.

By the time I'd been at the research center for four months, and they seemed pleased. I silently asked my double if he knew what prompted that, but he just shrugged it off. So did I.

I withdrew a little from the world at that point. I was having trouble relating to people. It seemed to me that they were so confused and unsure of themselves, I could ask myself and get an answer.

A friend confronted me one evening. He pounded at the door until I answered it

I was about to apologize to him,"" it said, and before I knew what I was doing, I had. I heard his nose break. He fell to the floor and came up swinging, and we beat each other up and down my apartment.

I was more furious then than I have ever been, hunched over and sobbing. The police were by a few minutes later, but I told them that he had been the instigator, and since he wasn't around to refute me, they let me off with a warning. My tulpa was grinning the entire time. We spent the night crowing about my victory and sneering over how badly I'd beaten my friend.

It wasn't until the next morning, not me. I'd been feeling guilty and a little ashamed, but he'd goaded me into a vicious fight with a concerned friend. He was present, of course, and knew my thoughts. ""You don't need him anymore. You don't need anyone else,"" he told me, and I felt my skin crawl.

I explained all this to the researchers who employed me, and nodded his head, then smirked at me.

I tried to take their words to heart, and more menacing. His eyes twinkled with mischief, and I saw malice in his constant smile. No job was worth losing my mind over, I decided. If he was out of control, I'd put him down. I was so used to him at that point that visualizing him was an automatic process, so I started trying my damnedest to not visualize him. It took a few days, but it started to work somewhat. I could get rid of him for hours at a time. But every time he came back, his teeth more pointed. He hissed and gibbered and threatened and swore. The discordant music I'd been listening to for months seemed to accompany him everywhere. Even when I was at home - I'd relax and slip up

I was still visiting the research center and spending my six hours there. I needed the money, two impressively men grabbed and restrained me, and someone in a lab coat jabbed a hypodermic needle into me.

I woke up from my stupor back in the room, with my doppelganger standing over me cackling. He hardly looked human anymore. His features were twisted. His eyes were sunken in their sockets and filmed over like a corpse's. He was much taller than me, but hunched over. His hands were twisted, and the fingernails were like talons. He was, in short, fucking terrifying. I tried to will him away, but I just couldn't seem to concentrate. He giggled, but could hardly move at all.

""They're pumping you full of the good shit

The next few weeks were terrible. Every so often, and sometimes left me hallucinating or delusional. My thoughtform was still present, constantly mocking. He interacted with, or perhaps caused, my delusions. I hallucinated that my mother was there, scolding me, and then he cut her throat and her blood showered me. It was so real that I could taste it.

The doctors never spoke to me. I begged at times, demanded answers. They never spoke to me. They may have talked to my tulpa, my personal monster. I'm not sure. I was so doped and confused that it may have just been more delusion, but I remember them talking with him. I grew convinced that he was the real one, and I was the thoughtform. He encouraged that line of thought at times, mocked me at others.

Another thing that I pray was a delusion: he could touch me. More than that, and just hallucinated that he was responsible. Most days.

Then one day, he paused. A querulous look crossed his face, and reached out and touched my head. Like my mother used to when I was feverish. He stayed still for a long moment, and then smiled. ""All thoughts are creative,"" he told me. Then he walked out the door.

Three hours later, I made my way to the door and found it unlocked. I walked out into the empty hallway, and then ran. I stumbled more than once, but I made it down the stairs and out into the lot behind the building. There, I collapsed, weeping like a child. I knew I had to keep moving, but I couldn't manage it.

I got home eventually - I don't remember how. I locked the door, and slept for a day and a half. Nobody came for me in the night, and nobody came the next day, or the one after that. It was over. I'd spent a week locked in that room, but it had felt like a century. I'd withdrawn so much from my life beforehand that nobody had even known I was missing.

The police didn't find anything. The research center was empty when they searched it. The paper trail fell apart. The names I'd given them were aliases. Even the money I'd received was apparently untraceable.

I recovered as much as one can. I don't leave the house much, I tell myself. I survived. I use the concentration those bastards taught me to convince myself. It works, sometimes.

Not today, the police say. The perpetrator mugs his victims, then guts them.

The funeral was this afternoon. It was as lovely a service as a funeral can be, unsettling stuff, that sounds like feedback, and shrieking, and a modem dialing up. I hear it still - a little louder now.

1365546083.0,1c0rbm,Don't Cry,GLKnight,78,15,6,"Hey, and I know it's your only real way to cope with things

Do you remember when mom and dad asked you what you wanted for your birthday, so you cried and cried for almost a week. And on your birthday, what was their gift? A bicycle. So you cried and cried, until you heard some little barks, and then you saw her running from the kitchen. She was little, and yellow, and so happy to be around you. What did you call her? That's right! You called her Matilda.

The next couple of months flew by so fast, and that was all that really mattered. But one morning, you woke up, and Matilda wasn't there, was she? So you told your parents, and they immediately went looking for her, asking for you to trust them. And you cried and you cried, they found her in a ditch. And you cried and cried

Do you remember a couple years later, all the loneliness? All the deep feelings of losing something very important to you? Do you remember what you asked your mom what you should do? In her drunken candor, saying that death is the only time that loss counts as keeping someone or something, like Matilda? You spent your time in your room, crying your eyes out again. The next night, you were staying with your father, when his girlfriend tried to make nice

""She won't open up to me"", your father's scream coming from the bathroom, and you ran to him, and all the blood that was all over the bathroom floor? Her body in the tub, alcohol and pills everywhere, her slit wrist limply hanging over the side? The shock must have been too much, because you didn't cry after that. In fact, it was quite a while before you cried again. High school

Do you remember him? Johnny Whitmueller. He was such a nice kid. Football player, had bought his own car by the age of 16. He was such a catch. You'd say you were the opposite. Shy, so reserved about everything, no friends to speak of. So alone. But out of the blue, he asked you to Prom, and everyone was so shocked. Here he was, the Big Man on Campus, instead of the Captain of the Cheerleaders. Word spread quickly. Then the rumors moved faster

Slut. Pity case. Skank. Wannabe welfare queen. Trailer trash. Cat lady. That one was the most preposterous. You don't really LIKE animals, used to kill you from the inside out. You didn't outwardly cry, but everyone could see you wanted to. So they got worse, eventually moving to slapping you, abusing you, holding you down and cutting your hair, forcing you to wear gaudy makeup. And the teachers? They never lifted a finger. They really didn't care

But Prom is where everything went to Hell for you

You were so pretty. You actually spent time taking care of yourself, it looked like a wedding dress. Anyone could see that you would have been the most beautiful bride in the world. And Johnny was so handsome in his suit, perfectly tailored and looking like a model. The red corsage he placed on your white glove was so nice, the perfect splash of color. He really was your Prince Charming, wasn't he?

The event itself wasn't that spectacular, and he said all the right things. You hadn't even noticed they were getting ready for the coronation of the Prom Queen and King until one of the Cheerleaders reminded everybody of the nominees. You were shocked when you were announced as one of the candidates. And when it came to the announcement of who the queen was, you were even more surprised that you had won.

Everybody cheered for you when you walked onto the stage, and pulled a screen down, and a projection start playing. A video of some nameless cheerleader and Johnny, having sex. She egged him on, asking him why he was taking you to Prom. Your tears wouldn't stop when he said he didn't care about you, how he was only using you. You were there for his amusement, and then you would be thrown away.

He tried to tell you otherwise, but you just threw them away and continued running home. Mom tried to ask you what happened, but you ran to your room, locked the door, and cried and cried for days afterward. There were even days when you woke up, cried, and then went back to bed, and all the things associated with it go away. You just had to trust me.

Do you remember how Johnny died? How, but the alcohol was. Do you remember your daddy's girlfriend? Well, not the alcohol and pills, but the wrists were mine. As for Matilda, I felt I would lose you if you learned about responsibility. I couldn't have that. Just like I can't have you crying right now.

Shhhh, don't cry, okay? You know I don't want to see you cry. Just like I don't want to lose you.

I am always with you.

I was there from the time you were born. I stood in the delivery room, in the corner, watching you with cloudy eyes, but I was there from the time you were born.

And I followed you home.

I was with you always, drifting behind your mother's car on your ride to preschool. You alone in the bathroom, but I was on the other side of the door, wind whistling through the bruised hole in my throat. My arms twisted and hanging in their sockets as I stood hunched on the other side of the shower curtain. I wait and follow you. I follow and drift behind you.

I'm not seen. I'm almost not-there in light. You never saw me that morning as I sat across from you at the breakfast table

I spend hours of your day doing nothing more than breathing in your ear.

Breathing -- gagging

I crave to be close to you, underneath your bed, at your sleeping face in the dark.

Yes. You caught me staring occasionally. Your parents came running down to your room one night when you screamed. You were just beginning to talk, swinging back and forth. I sank back into your closet and your mother was unable to see me though you pointed and pointed and pointed. You thought you'd never forget when they left that same night. You saw the closet door crack so softly and me crawling across the floor to your bed on all fours, shambling in jerking movements as I pushed myself under your bed on disjointed limbs.

You learned a new word for me: boogeyman. Not quite the monster you thought I was. I'm just waiting and following you always
You'll see me again soon. Any day now

You rolling on the pavement

As you stare up from the cold pavement with cloudy eyes; your matted

You'll see me approaching.

No one else will see me. You will stare past them into my eyes and I'll leer down at you. For the first time in our life

I'll lean down

Our faces will touch. My wings will unfurl. And then you'll have to follow me.

And I am always with you.

Warmth. Warm. Your bed is warm, and climb into bed. You close your eyes, dreaming of the sunny days sure to come.

You look out of your window that's right beside the bed, falling onto your roof.

Tap. Tap. Tap. A pattern of sounding taps that create a sea of sound above and around you.

Tap. Tap. Tap. Awash in your warm bed

Tap. Tap. Tap.

Nothing can pull you away from your bed

Tap. Tap. Tap.

A loud burst of thunder peals through the sky, you say. Just thunder. You climb out of bed, a little thirsty from sleeping in your warm bed. You head to the kitchen for something to drink. You go to the sink, pull a glass from the cupboard, and get some water. A contrasting coolness to your warm bed. You rinse your glass and look at the rain falling to the ground. Condensation has started creeping up the windows. You stare at the misty glass, surprised at how chilly it is in the middle of the warmest period of the year.

That's when you see the condensation crawl turn into a pattern before you. It works around some curves, you think. It's just someone's hand, after all. Maybe someone passed by the house when you were asleep. It's not the safest place in the world, but it's safe enough.

The mist continues crawling across the window

**IT'S SO COLD OUTSIDE**

You stare at the window. Is there someone outside right now? You glance around, thinking they can fuck with whoever lives there. You pay it no mind, put away your cup, and begin to walk to the bathroom.

The chill of the night starts to settle in, then the rain continues it's tapping. You take care of your business, and proceed to wash your hands. Drying them, you look in the mirror, thinking of what you're going to do when the summer sun comes back, and all the things you're going to do in the warm summer air. Yeah, warm. I should get back to bed

It grabs your attention immediately. Even though your light is on, but not THAT cold! It's shouldn't be moving this quickly! You can only stare at the misting mirror as another hand print reveals itself, longer and more narrow than the previous one. Your head begins to spin as either someone is playing an elaborate prank on you, or you realize you're not alone. You stare at the mirror as it creeps past the hand, waiting for the words to appear.

""'It's so cold outside' again, wondering if the person is more imaginative than he first seemed. You watch as the mist reveals the message.

**I'M SO COLD**

That... wasn't as scary as you thought it would be. You laugh at the notion you were getting scared, and make your way back to your room. As you climb into bed, you wrap yourself up and look out the window. The rain is still going strong, and you can't wait for your summer to actually begin. You listen to the rain as it's rhythm lulls you to sleep.

Tap. Tap. Tap. Your eyes start getting heavy.

Tap. Tap. Tap. The summer is about to begin.

Tap. Tap. Tap. Time to be in the warmth again.

Tap. Tap.

Mist begins crawling across your bedroom window. Right as you were on the verge of sleep, it's higher than the others.

It's just a prank, and you stare as the words reveal themselves directly before your eyes.

**YOUR BED IS SO WARM**

You feel a shifting on your bed, placing it's head close behind yours. It's breath is cold and foul, like a bog or other body of water. It's heavy, ragged breathing is so close to yours that it feels like it's matching you on purpose. Your heart grows cold as you hear it speak to you in a raspy, gargling whisper.

1357944905.0,16embm,Are there any creepypastas with actual video footage or evidence?,mjthrillme2020,74,19,46,"Recently I came across a Mario Creepypasta ""Hotel Mario: The 13th Hotel"" and it actually had [Video Footage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCpdAULmDz0). So I was wondering if you guys know of any creepypastas that have this kind of stuff. For example,self,
1341506799.0,w2zzv,I used to be fearless...,MagiCraft,66,12,22,"I used to be fearless.

Horror movies never really scared me. Scary books had no effect. Haunted houses are meaningless. I was never a child who slept with the covers over their face, and the few that I did, most would never consider a nightmare at all.

I've simply never been afraid of what goes bump in the night. Our home security system kept away fears of very real humans with dark intentions, well, who could be afraid in a nice, white, upper class community? I've lived in a bland bubble all my life, never knowing what fear is.

So why should I ever be afraid of the dark?

Up until this moment, and it's brought on a surreal sort of calm…When I finish warning you, it will be all over. So forgive me if I'm being long-winded…I enjoyed life a bit more than I was once willing to admit.

It all started with what I thought was a virus. I had been linked to a video called ""Girls and Boys Come Out to Play."" It sounded harmless enough. I thought it was an art student's film

I can't remember the video. All I can remember is the feeling it brought up. It wasn't fear

From then on, strange noises would emit from my computer, even when the sound wasn't on. Screaming, strange laughter, grinding noises…

At the time, like those ridiculous 'screamers' that scared my friends in high school. Yet these were different. They looked real. They were the faces of the dead; and they had died violent deaths.

I wish I could say that I stopped using the computer

I tried to take it in to have the virus removed

Meanwhile, they would hold my gaze. I couldn't look away from them and their terrible, mocking grins. And oh, God…the smell. My computer forever had a vague stench of death around it.

I thought I was going crazy. I thought that perhaps someone was messing with me. The people at the computer repair place didn't know what they were talking about. Something was wrong

So I got a new computer. Everything was fine for a while, the rotted faces showed their stinking bodies. I could see every maggot, every fly, every pus-filled crevice…And they were calling to me. Telling me that soon, very soon, I'd be joining them. They were so angry that I had tried to get rid of them, and now they would make me pay.

I didn't know what to do. Ignoring the problem wasn't working. I thought maybe it was the fault of a friend from work. Perhaps it came from the emails they had been sending me? I never thought it was the video. Not for a second. After all

I was at the end of my rope. Today, and pray that everything would be back to normal.

A few minutes ago, I felt true fear. I had no idea that in a few moments, it would become mind-numbing.

I stumbled through the house

The computer.

The unplugged computer was on

I couldn't help myself. I sat down across from her with the darkness caving in all around me. And then the woman, and then the screen went black. And without light, without a means of seeing my reflection, I saw her behind me for the briefest of moments, a bloody and rusted knife in hand. The computer came back to life, and my old background had returned.

But I know it's not over.

So I've decided to come here. I know you all like to be scared, and not everything is fun and games.

Of course

The thing is…I haven't been completely honest with you. There was no video. It was a story. A story quite similar to this one

Now that you've read this, but it has to be done. I just hope that you can take comfort in knowing that when I'm the woman haunting your computer, I'll be a bit more gentle. If I can, I'll use a blade that's a little less dull. Pictures of those who came before us who are a little less grotesque. Sounds that are a little less alarming.

But then again

Don't worry. I wont ask you to repost this story five times. Nothing will save you. After all

The power is still out. And I know

Goodbye for now.

1341128699.0,vvex6,the day that changed everything.,ch_bu13,73,13,18,"things aren't going too well in my marriage. it all began a couple of months ago, the day she fell from the stairs, for a change of scenery. she doesn't say it

everyday I have to wake up, sometimes reading the news, sometimes talking to her and waiting endlessly for an answer. after that it's off to work where I have to remember after my shift to find some muscle relaxant. since she can't move her body anymore I have to inject her regularly every 8 hours or so to prevent bed sores. just another one of those things that go on unappreciated. arriving home, I sometimes tell her about my day over supper, or sometimes it's silent, if the day was hard. I then have to wash her... it's unbelievable how she manages to smell the way she does at the end of the day, especially when she can't even move! then it's time for bed, sleep seems to slip further and further from my reach... everyday

exhaustion was weighing me down and my patience was running thin. one night I just couldn't take it anymore. during supper I was telling her how my day was hard and how I lost a patient on the operating table due to a mistake that I made because I wasn't able to focus properly. when I looked at her, I looked at her. she was staring at me down, but still didn't talk. probably still under the shock of when I struck her. tears ran down my face as I apologized. I took her in my arms and brought her into our room. I promised her that we'd talk about it after I'd have time to calm down. I kissed her on the forehead before leaving. this was the first time that I've kissed her since I caught her cheating on me. even despite the smell (I haven't had the time yet to bathe her today), I felt that the kiss reignited something in me, in us. before leaving the room, I glanced back at her and saw her looking at me. was she smiling? impossible. she hadn't smiled since that accident, hell, I smiled back at her

I took my time cleaning up the mess I made during our fight and cleaned the dishes. when I came back in the room, I couldn't help myself and kissed her lips instead. I suddenly had an urge I couldn't control and took our clothes off. we made love passionately and at one point I could've sworn that I heard her moan. It sent chills down my spine, though it was impossible that the sound came from her. after I was done I looked at her and gasped. her eyes... they were different. they were... closed? impossible. still I brought my head close to her ear and whispered ""I love you"" as I always did when we were in love. I felt something slowly brush against my neck. I let out a frightened whimper as I realised she was wrapping her hands around my neck. ""I love you too sweetie"" she whispered softly as she held our naked bodies together in an embrace. ""I know you pushed me that day, on the stairs. I forgive you now,"" she said. A tear rolled down my eyes. I started to mutter incoherently some prayers. after all, all this was impossible. my wife died that day. on the stairs. I killed her. she couldn't be talking, she could't be movin

""we can be together forever now. forever."" she said. her hands wrapped tighter around my neck. I then heard a snap as my neck yielded, everything went black.

1340918234.0,vrfap,Welcome to Vietnam.,XxDarkKissxX,63,11,13,"Lieutenant Aidan Clark was dying, soft butter and lodging in the sensitive tissues of his left lung. The other bullets sprayed wildly in every direction, alcoholic father and his poor overworked mother. He thought about the beautiful girl that he loved

He wondered about his platoon of Marines; the new, and how almost all of them shrieked and cried in their sleep, longing for home when the night terrors started. He thought about how they would wake up with tears still drying on their smooth, unblemished, boyish cheeks and how they would stand, wipe them away and shake it off as if it were nothing, pretend it didn’t happen. They told themselves and each other that it was going to be okay because the buddy they just watched get blown into a tree by a land mine was in a better place, blood still drying on his shirt was nothing more than an animal

The pain suddenly swallowed up all conscious thought. Aidan’s screams finally rang in his own ears, digging a deeper tunnel under the already shattered ribs and shredding his already ruined lung even more. He blinked rapidly, trying to clear the sweat and blood and dirt and suddenly vomited a fountain of black blood and torn pieces of lung and shuddered. The hot, humid air was turning into a freezing cold and he shuddered once, twice and then spasmed like an epileptic without medication. His vision faded to black and he prayed, over and over for the death throes to end. He thought about the girl back home, crying and missing him, drew one last gasp of damp air….

And woke up, stretched and walked outside of his foxhole he’d dug the night before in the moss. It was all a nightmare…

1354398587.0,144csh,So Very Long Ago,crypticcarisal,66,14,11,"   We used to live happily out in our big house by the woods. Mother and Father would throw fantastic parties whenever we had guests and I had several friends. On our dining room table, Father was gone. Mother told me he wouldn’t come back, not even for holidays or anything. It was just Mother and me for a really long time.
	
   One day, I watched the strange man, as he seemed to be staying with us now. 
	
   I remember he was very fond of the great, the curtains open, letting the light of day shine in, reflecting off the ebony. His eyes would be closed, and I would wonder if he had been turned to stone. But then I would hear the music, and I would see him, eyes still closed
	
   Many times, however, I was careless and accidently knocked over an antique bear that had been resting on the velvet sofa. The little bell around its neck rung as it met with the floor. The man’s eyes opened and he looked over at me with those dark, windowpane eyes. I just stared for awhile, not sure what a proper response would be, until he grumbled something that I deciphered was an invitation to play the piano. Sheepishly, I walked over and sat down on the bench, even if I played the notes entirely wrong. 
The man, nor did he smile, or blink, or nod. He simply sat with me, watching the keys move up and down.
I remember then was when Mother came into the room and yelled over to me. She looked angry and worried at the same time. She told me to “Get over here right this minute”, and walked back to stand by her. There, she glared over at the man, who looked across at her. She still had that mixture of fear and hostility in her eyes. Later, she told me, while we were sitting at the empty dining table, “Don’t pay any attention to that man.”
After a few days had passed, and I tried to believe her. 

Weeks went by without so much as a pin falling and I grew bored and tired. I slept for large portions of the light hours and remained hauled up in my room most days, three visitors came to our house. The small-faced man had returned, and with him, a nun and a priest. I had wondered why he had brought them, but I never asked the man or Mother. 

For a few hours, muttering the same words while holding a rosary to her lips. At this point, Mother was beside me, watching the three with a fixed, horrified expression. The priest’s mumbling soon became fuzzy words, which soon became shouting, chanting. I saw him glance around, glassy eyes on Mother. He started yelling furiously at her, facing the priest, Mother started walking toward the front door

1349469222.0,110dzd,The Art Of Jacob Emory,YES_Im_Taco,64,13,4,"Ghost stories? Nah

…You really want to know?… Well, just no interrupting. I don’t have the patience for it.

How to describe Jacob Emory… well, “jack of all trades, ace of none.” Most of this was due to his own lack of will. He dabbled in damn near everything this town could offer him, automobiles, radio operation, store management, what have you, but everybody got the same unsatisfying response: “It just wasn’t enough.” Needless to say

It was probably inevitable, but I think Gertrude down the street knew before she passed on- you’ll have to scout someone else if you ever get curious. In any case, no one even tried to stop him. Everybody thought that a little travel would stamp the ambition out of him, or else feed it until it was no longer an issue. Hell, we even gave him a sending-off party, which I thought was pretty nice of everybody.

So anyway, too. Anyways, he came back, eventually, and he had changed, obviously enough. He was amiable, energetic, and we all quickly learned why. He showed us a souvenir he’d brought back- a solid black stick, there’s got to be a better word for it- with this stick

It dropped, but it acted out on it, sort of like an old movie projector on a screen.

Son, then you can leave an old man to his craziness, but I know what I saw, even if everyone’s been hushing it up, and that stone he drew dropped. Jake even passed around the paper, and as it was being passed, it rolled around as the paper got tilted. None of us had any words for it- Hell, stick figures in various pageants and plays doing everything from fighting each other to making perfect “human” pyramids, his drawings ethical

Poor Jacob. If I’d not been so swept up in the moment, we all were, and we saw no problem with encouraging him with what we all saw as an incredible experience to be shared with everyone else. Now, he didn’t have any big radio or television connections, mind you, and the internet wouldn’t come around for another decade, so he did what all people on a shoestring budget do- he advertised his show with fliers. Fliers might not mean anything to you city-folk, they gain a fair glance-over from time to time

And his shows were fantastic. Someone would shout out a scene from a play or a comedy sketch, and he could make an incredible human figure in minutes. Come to think of it, I don’t remember any of his scenes lasting more than ten minutes to make. They were all really well-done scenes, too- not only could you see a knight charge a castle, Jake would draw the castle’s interior as well, like a wedding cake split down the middle, so you could see the knight scale the walls, fight back out with the princess, either the characters would leave off a wall or he’d cover the wall with white paint. This was good

Jake, he’d been extremely energetic. Well, that energy, that vitality or fervor or whatever you want to call it, it never left him. Not for an instant. Far from it, it seemed to grow in him, and he enjoyed it all too much. His eyes grew wider, his statements and opinions more radical and frenzied

A month or two passed, put on the next blank space on the wall, sometimes to the intriguing effect of causing scenes to mingle, which the crowd loved. The subject matter got more wild and immoral, the monsters got more bizarre and creative, the fighters using more impossible weaponry, all for the sake of the crowd’s interests. Jake got steadily more indulgent, and he became a drinker and a womanizer (neither of which got rid of that vitality, there’s rumors that one or two of them got glances at that notepad. Those anonymous few supposedly said that those drawings absolutely weren’t nude pictures, though

On the night of one of his performances, and I could smell the bourbon on him from ten feet away. The show started, he went through a bunch of sketches and scenarios the crowd recommended, when at the end someone asked that he draw himself. Everyone cheered the idea, I guessed they’d been wondering what his creations thought of him, and he eventually obliged.

No sooner had Jake finished connecting the final two lines on his coat, expansive wall, all stopped and looked directly at that illustration. Lovers stopped kissing, clowns stopped laughing, robots stopped fighting pirates, everything stopped and looked at the Jacob-illustration. The crowd died almost instantly- I remember Jake’s face at that moment, pale white, and looking desperately for the cans of white paint he’d forgotten to put out before the show. Everyone else? They were looking at the fake Jacob.

That Jacob reached into his jacket pocket, drew a door. He pushed on his side and the door swung open, allowing him to walk through onto the floor of the auditorium.

The rest was an absolute hellish pandemonium. People screamed and ran for the exits as Jacob’s characters, throwing pies, shooting lasers, blowing fire and poison and the impossible. I was near enough the exit to escape, and gave only one backwards glance. The scene will haunt me forever.

Jacob Emory was being dragged by his creations

The auditorium burned down, what happened to the fake Emory, or how many people died. The fire brought the fire department from the nearest cities up to over a hundred miles away- they in turn brought the police force, which brought the government, which hushed up everything. They took the fliers and any art Jake had made, and swore everyone to secrecy or else life detainment. The fire was blamed on a cigarette in the garbage during a basketball game, and we all eventually went on with our lives. Jacob was made to never have existed.

In retrospect, shadows made to look like real things. Jacob had been making life- actual thinking things in some alternate dimension, using a power that was never meant to fall to mortal hands. He got drunk on his power. His punishment was probably well-deserved.

Incidentally, you know. The auditorium’s ruins. I hear they’re going to start reconstruction soon, which will wipe out any remaining evidence someone can definitely see, but I went back there once, several years after the fire- just once. Amidst the rubble, covered in ash, I saw something squirming. I looked closer. It was Jacob Emory’s hand on the wall. Exactly like it had been three years ago, I remember

That was mistake number one. Number two was those creations.

Like I said, but I will say only this- Those tall grass meadows on the outskirts of town? Don’t go into them. Ever. You were asking about those white figures you’ve seen at night, right?

1357887011.0,16d8qw,Goatman,saucy_pasta,74,20,21,"I was 16 and had family down in Alabama.  They are farmers and own a huge amount of land in Huntsville.  My uncle owns a big house and a bunch of trailers they put out in the woods for hunting and camping.  While I was down south my cousins suggest we go out camping for a few days.  We get to the camp and it's obvious something is weird.  The air has a strange electric smell like right before a storm like ozone.  We don't think much of it and unpack and go down to a little creek to swim for a few hours.  All of the sudden some older white guy and a white teenager come out of the bushes.  He has a shotgun in the crook of his arm and says hello.  He asks what we're doing this far back in the woods.  I tell him about my uncle, asks if he can hang out with us.  His dad says ok.

We end up playing football and dicking around.  There's me, and 4 of their friends.  5 girls and 6 boys.  We were all around 15-17.  We ended up just dicking the day away and going back to the camp and getting set up for a campfire even though we had trailers with kitchenettes.  Tanner said he wants to run home and ask his dad if he can come camping with us.  His families property sits up against my uncle's.  My cousin ""Rooster"" says he's going to go with him since it's getting pretty dark.  One of the girls says she's going to tag along.  At this point it's about 7:00 and it's starting to get pretty dark.  They take flashlights and head off on the trail towards Tan's property.  The rest of us just chill and make smores, drink, and hit on the girls.

About 30 or 40 minutes later there's the smell of ozone again.  You could smell it over the smell of the fire we had going.  It had a really nasty copper smell like the smell you get after you've had a nosebleed.  It wasn't exactly like dried blood but it was that strong, Tan, and the girl all come running into the clearing out of breath.  They don't even break stride they all just run into the trailer next to where the fire is.

We all NOPE the fuck out of there and get into the trailers.  They end up calming down a bit but even Rooster is crying his fucking eyes out.  Meanwhile

Rooster finally stops crying and shaking.  The girl had stopped too but she was just staring out the window with a dumb look on her face.  He says they had gotten halfway into the woods toward the camp when they started to hear shit in the forest.  It was almost pitch black by this time so they weren't sure what the fuck it was.  The girl said she heard something in the bushes right off the trail and they all beamed their flashlights over there.  There was something standing back in the woods in a little hollow.  Rooster said they had shouted at him and told him he was scaring the fuck out of them and that he was a dick.  He said that's when he realized that the guy was facing away from them.  So they keep walking and they start to smell the nasty coppery ozone smell and they say the look off into the forest on the opposite side and it's a dude standing in the forest backwards but this time he's slightly closer to the path.

So now they start powerwalking and Tan keeps saying he should have taken the fucking rifle.  As their telling the story the smell is still super strong even inside the trailer.  They say after they started walking faster

So we're out in the fucking woods and at this point we're assuming it's some rednecks or some shit trying to fuck with us.  All of the sudden, I had never heard of goat man or any of that.  But a couple years ago, the year before I graduated from college, I had a Menom for a roommate and I ended up asking him about it.  To sum it up it's basically a fucking man with the head of a goat and he can shape shift and he gets among groups of people to terrorize them.  It's also suppose to be kind of like the Wendigo and it's bad mojo to even talk about it and even worse if you see it.  Keep in mind, I didn't know this back when I was 16.  So my cousin is going: ""the goat man is gonna get in and fucking get us.""  The girls are all terrified and my cousins and I are all fucking trying to figure out if it's just some hillbillies or if it's some animal.

So all of the sudden the smell just goes away.  Like to this day, we've stopped shitting bricks enough to go back outside and stoke the fire again.  We figure it was just some assholes trying to fuck with us so we don't go back home.  We think that if we do, they'll just chase us through the woods or some shit.  Nothing else weird happens that night and we stay another night.  For the main part of the night nothing happens.  At about 1 in the morning we're outside getting drunk and telling ghost stories.  As someone finishes a spooky story, I don't remember what it was about, the smell comes back.  And it is so fucking strong that one of the girls literally starts vomiting.  I stand up, and you can actually feel how clammy th air is, and I say we should get inside.  This isn't right.  We should have just fucking left.  We all go back inside and were standing around.  My cousin keeps going on about how it's the goat man.  My cousin Rooster tries to shut him the fuck up.  All the while I'm just feeling that something is wrong and I can't figure out what the fuck it is.

We end up sitting in there for a while and the smell is just as strong.  We're terrified and all huddled in this camper.  We end up cooking brats for everybody because no one wants to go outside.  It's on of those packs with 4 brats in it and we have a total of 3 packs.  I grill them up on the stove and give everybody a hot dog.  I get mine.  After a while one of my cousins gets up and goes over to the stove to get another one.

He starts grumbling about how the fuck do I get 2 and everyone else only got 1.  I look at him like he's fucking stupid.  I tell him that everybody only got 1 because there were only 12 brats.  If he wants more he should open up a new pack and cook some more.  That's when the girl that had been with Rooster and Tan just starts screaming ""OH JESUS OH LORD GET OUT!""  She's crying and shivering

I shit you not.  My cousin verified.  There had been 12 people in the trailer.  Being that everybody didn't really know each other well

The girl keeps praying to jesus and we're all sitting outside.  Eventually

So we are pretty much scared as fuck and we huddle together.  I fall asleep.  When I wake up the sun is just coming up and half the people are asleep and the other half are packing our shit up.  We want to walk back home but like 4 people want to stay until the sun is all the way up.  Some of the pople think that we're just fucking around and still want to stay at the trailers.  I just want to get the fuck out of the woods.

The girl's name is Keira, that we need to get the fuck out of dodge.  Tanner leaves with the other group to go get a rifle and says he's going to be back.  So there are just 7 of us left at this point and it's about 4:00.

At around 5 he hasn't made it back yet and we're getting extremely fucking antsy and the only reason I stopped begging them to go back was because he went to get a gun.  At about 5:30 or so when my cousin that did stay says that that girl Keira is outside.  We all look outside and sure enough she's standing by the firepit with her back to the cabin.  I'm thinking to myself: she was so fucking scared why the hell would she come back?  And then I get this nasty feeling in my gut.  Keep in mind

I say this to the rest of them and they all laugh at me and ask if I set this all up to scare them.  I'm look at them like

She backs up a little bit towards the trailer and we lock the fucking door and pull down all of the shades except one.  We put someone in a chair to keep an eye on her.  She stands there for another 20 minutes or so then the guy turns to say that she's still there.  Then there's a huge fucking bang on the door.  We all jump the fuck up and scramble around the living room of the trailer.  The banging is super fucking loud.

“When I was a second year in college, candles were placed along the windows if a watchman was present, but normally once you left the rooms, you were faced with complete darkness. It’s common to wake up someone if you needed to walk down to the restroom at the end of the hall. We all had a childish fear of being alone in the dark.

One night, she laughed and danced. I could not see her at all, but her bangles clanked together loudly and the bells on her anklets jingled softly. It was very calming. I laughed and sashayed my hips down the hallway with her, too tired to match elaborate arm movements. She said nothing to me, though occasionally I heard her hum one of our favorite Bollywood songs. The same thing happened on our return. I fell back asleep easily.

I awoke fairly late the next morning to the sound of men in our room. They surrounded her bed. I bolted from my bed, almost 5 hours before I woke her.”

1374179595.0,1il1bk,"One of my favorite pastas. Very subtle. ""Killswitch""",niyou77,73,20,22,"In the spring 1989 the Karvina Corporation released a curious game

The game was “Killswitch.”

On the surface it was a variant on the mystery or horror survival game, vague grey and white shapes against a black background. Slow MIDI versions of Czech folksongs play throughout. Players could choose between two avatars: an invisible demon named Ghast or a visible human woman, Porto. Play as Ghast was considerably more difficult due to his total invisibility, and players were highly liable to restart the game as Porto after the first level, in which it was impossible to gauge jumps or aim. However, Ghast was clearly the more powerful character–he had fire-breath and a coal-steam attack, but as it was above the skill level of most players to keep track of where a fire-breathing, Porto became more or less the default.

Porto’s singular ability was seemingly random growth–she expanded and contracted in size throughout the game. A Kansas engineering grad claimed to have figured out the pattern involved

Porto awakens in the dark with wounds in her elbows, investigating its collapse and beset on all sides by demons similar to Ghast, as well as dead foremen, coal-golems, and demonic inspectors from the Sovatik corporation, whose boxy bodies were clothed in red, the only color in the game. The environment, becomes genuinely uncanny as play progresses. There are no “bosses” in any real sense–Porto must simply move physically through tunnels to reach subsequent levels while her size varies wildly through inter-level spaces.

The story that emerges through Porto’s discovery of magnetic tapes, and deciphering an impressively complex code inscribed on a series of iron axes players must collect (This portion of the game was almost laughably complex, and defeated many players until “Porto881″ posted the cipher to a Columbia BBS. Attempts to contact this player have been unsuccessful, and the username is no longer in use on any known service.) is that the foremen, under pressure to increase coal production, began to falsify reports of malfunctions and worker malfeasance in order to excuse low output, which incited a Sovatik inspection. Officials were dispatched, and an extraordinary story of torture unfolds, and as the town of Karvina itself was devastated by the departure of the coal industry

After solving the axe-code, pre-revolution equipment they used and wakened them to avenge the workers. It is generally assumed that the “fires of the earth” are demons like Ghast, coal-fumes and gassy bodies inhabiting the old machines. The machines themselves are so “big” that the graphics elect to only show two or three gear-teeth or a conveyor belt rather than the entire apparatus. The machines drove the inspectors mad, and they disappeared into caverns with their knives (only to emerge to plague Porto, of course). The workers were often crushed and mangled in the onslaught of machines, who were neither graceful nor discriminating. Porto herself was knocked into a deep chasm by a grief-stricken engine, and her
fluctuating size

What follows is the most cryptic and intuitive part of the game. There is no logical reason to proceed in the “correct” way, and posted it to the Columbia boards. If Porto ingests the raw coke, she will find her body under control,and can go on to fight her way out of the final levels of the mine, which are impassable in her giant state, clutching the tape containing this extraordinary story. However, as she crawls through the final tunnel to emerge aboveground
white.

Killswitch, all trace of it is removed from the user’s computer. The game cannot be copied. For all intents and purposes it exists only for those playing it, and then ceases to be entirely. One cannot replay it, unlocking further secrets or narrative pathways, one cannot allow another to play it, and perhaps most importantly, it is impossible to experience the game all the way to the end as both Porto and Ghast.

Predictably, but Karvina Corp. released only 5,000 copies and refused to press further editions. The following is an excerpt from their May 1990 press release:

""Killswitch was designed to be a unique playing experience: like reality,and illogical. One might even say ineffable. Death is final; death is complete. The fates of Porto and her beloved Ghast are as unknowable as our own. It is the desire of the Karvina Corporation that this be so, and we ask our customers to respect that desire. Rest assured Karvina will continue to provide the highest quality of games to the West, and that Killswitch is merely one among our many wonders.""

This did not have the intended effect. The word “beloved” piqued the interest of committed, with the intent of playing as Ghast and discovering the meaning of Karvina’s cryptic word. The most popular theory was that Ghast would at some point become the fumes inhaled by Porto, changing her size and beginning her adventure. Some thought this was wishful thinking, that if only Ghast’s early levels were passable one would somehow be able to play as both simultaneously. However, by this time no further copies appeared to be available in retail outlets. Players who had not yet completed the game attempted Ghast’s levels frequently, but the difficulty of actually playing this enigmatic avatar persisted, and no player has ever claimed to have finished the game as Ghast. One by one, unearthly world drew them back to her

To find any copy usable today is an almost unfathomably rare occurance; a still shrink-wrapped copy was sold at auction in 2005 for $733, filming and uploading his progress. However, to date, the only film which has surfaced is a one minute and forty five second clip of a haggard Yamamoto at his computer, the avatar-choice screen visible over his right shoulder.

Yamamoto is crying.

I guess

I guess I can thank my brother Shane, the shitbag stuck his gum on the backside of my rearview mirror. Strange that something so....small...can wake you up. It was during a transition spell, that's the best way to describe it. You've probably had one too. Where you've been driving....and you suddenly just...wake up? You haven't been asleep...but it's like, you weren't there. Like your body being on autopilot while you take a dump in the back of your mind. I remember feeling the slightly moist sticky gum as I pressed my finger firmly into it. I remember thinking ""That son of a BITCH!"" and it just suddenly dawned on me....

I was adjusting the mirror to look at myself. I could see myself, but I wasn't the one wearing it. The look in my eyes, that ....smile....I had. I almost had a heart attack right there in the street. I swerved, nearly clipped a light post, and finally stopped on the shoulder. Got out and threw my guts up. People driving by were giving me the whole gambit of looks. Crazy guy, drunk, sucks to be you dude...except for one lady. She didn't even look in my direction, looking at herself in the rearview mirror with that wide eyed

I still have these...little hiccups in time. Do you have those? Where you're getting ready in the morning

I saw my first swap in the coffee shop three days ago.....It was a young woman. She had gone into that ""trance"" right in the middle of the dining room. Wide eyes, same unnerving expression of unrelenting joy on their face were just frozen in place, watching her. I tried to watch as discretely as possible. She leaned in...closer...and her face...I wish I could ease your imaginations and tell you that she stuck her face into the mirror like a pool of silver...but it wassn't like that. She stuck her face into the mirror like her face literally melted onto the glass. I'm not ashamed to say that I peed myself a little bit at that moment. Not enough to show on my jeans, but enough that my underwear was damp. her face melted onto the mirror and she just spasmed and jerked. her arms flailing and I swear every bone in her body was cracking and breaking. This one older guy, he walks in and just veers around her, like she's a potted plant and not some fucked up marionette puppet. One of her arms brushes against him and I see it. I see it on his face for just a moment, that look of sheer terror and sadness and everything wrong...but then it passed and he just simply didn't notice her anymore. After a few minutes, and just walked out. The others acted normal too. Talking

The lapses in time and the deja vu and all those little warning signs are getting more frequent now. Whatever I interrupted once before isn't going to just go away. It already staked claim in me and it will have me by force if not by corruption. I've removed all the mirrors and pots and metal in my apartment. Taped the windows. Last night I caught myself smiling into a cup of water before I shook it off. I just.....don't want to wake up locked away in a tiny dark room in my head where I no longer even realize that I am me. Watching but not really watching someone else drive my body. I'm going to turn off this computer monitor and try and sleep. I'll write some more later.

The nightmares… how I wish I could make them stop. Always the same thing every time. Staring into its dark eyes as it tells me, it gives me visions. Visions of the punishment that awaits me. Limbs being torn off and devoured to fuel this beast. I wait in the dark chambers of the nightmare for him and each time he punishes me in a different way. The horrible images of my body being torn and spewed across the room. I can hear him now, as I write this I hear him calling my name. In my last moments I hope to tell my story to you.

Late one night a couple friends and I scavenged the internet for something to give us our next scare. We were horror junkies and never really satisfied. We found a particularly scary instructional story stating that if you stand in front of a mirror (Original right?) and scream “I Offer you everything in my name so that you may manifest yourself

Anyways… there he is again. Worming his way in to my mind, I got the honor of saying the pact. I breathed in, something felt wrong, I still can’t put a finger on what it was, but it sent a shiver down my spine, I should have listened. I started “We offer you everything in our name so that you may manifest yourself, and bestow upon us your knowledge. With your name we seal this pact” and all at once we said “Ofödda.” My head started pounding, it stopped

“It has been done.” It said, they were filled with sheer terror. Not the kind that you got from watching a horror movie, but when you’re genuinely afraid for your life. We said nothing about what happened, but I knew they heard him too. They all left my house that night without saying a word. For the next week it was the same old thing as it was before our “pact.” I went to work and came back every day, then sat around and watched T.V. then tried to go to bed, usually to no avail. However, exactly one week from the day we did the ritual something strange occurred. 

I was just sitting and then, no challenge to daunting for my mind and it required no effort at all I just thought and there it was a complete dictionary on anything I wanted.

Eventually I contacted my other friends to see if I was the only one and as expected I wasn’t. All four of us started to meet up again and challenge each other’s knowledge, one by one slowly started disappearing and no one could figure out why. Hell, no one even noticed they were gone they just dropped out of existence sort of. Then the voices and the screeching started, and I remembered that I was still in debt.

Late one night

“Come now” It spoke

“What are you? Show yourself!” I yelled. I saw a dark mass moving in the darkness. It was hideous, almost as if someone was making a mask out of random bits of skin and tied it on the skull with a large rope. It’s eyes were just sunken black holes that were slightly hypnotic. Its sharp toothed grin stretched across its face. As soon as I laid eyes on the beast, my library opened a file on it only containing one word, Ofödda. In that instance, I knew what he wanted.

“I held my end of the deal” its raspy voice spoke

“I haven’t gotten to use the full extent of my knowledge, each laugh stabbing chilling daggers in my back.

“I’m surprised, and I can’t go much longer. I can see him in the corner of my eye, he’s here to collect, to make me part of him. 

I figure now is a good time to give you some truths. First, the meaning of life is hidden for a reason, but to the curious, don’t worry this brings me to my final truth. There was no mirror or pact with the unborn. The truth is, I read a story, very similar to this one. He survives off the knowledge of others. I’m very sorry I did this to you all, but don’t worry, even the meaning of existence. One last thing

Thank you for your time.

Due to the circumstances surrounding her birth, saying she would have nothing to do with this. True to her word, she never once went with me as I took Angelica for her checkups. She didn't even offer to help pay the hefty bills. Said she wouldn't have her money go towards a child that wasn't hers.

Throughout her first year on the earth, a normal baby. She would cry, sleep, laugh, and everything else you would expect a baby to do. Every month I would bring her to the neurologist for a checkup. This was perhaps the only part of her day that wasn't normal for a baby. The neurologist would inform me each visit that she was doing very well, but I would have to keep bringing her in, just in case something were to change. Once again

When Angelica was about a year old, were excited to say they would be having a child. A few months after Angelica hit one year old, Melinda went into labor. Charles Crandall Finster Jr. was born on April 13, 1989. Melinda was overjoyed at her healthy son, and we set up play dates between Charles, nicknamed Chuckie, and Angelica. These went over very well. Seeing my daughter grow up with close to a normal life made me feel hopeful that the visits to the neurologist wouldn't be necessary soon. And they weren't.

About half a year after Chuckie was born, the DeVille's, were pregnant now too. Betty DeVille never did an ultrasound to discover what gender her baby was, as she wanted it to be a surprise. Because of that, we never really knew if Betty's baby was a boy or girl. But I am getting way ahead of myself.

We continued to bring Angelica to Melinda and Chaz's house to play with Chuckie. She seemed so happy. The two of them would get into fights every once in a while

A few months before Chuckie's first birthday, where she stayed for the rest of her life. Chaz and Chuckie would go and visit her just about every day. I didn't bring Angelica to visit as often.  In fact, we eventually had to stop altogether. Angelica was so upset when I told her we wouldn't be visiting for a while.

“But why?” She asked one night before bed. It had been earlier that day when I had informed her that we wouldn't be visiting for a while. She had apparently been thinking about it all day. Her confusion and sadness had finally come out just after I had finished bathing her. Her eyes started to tear up.  

“Because Chuckie's mom is sick, picking her up and sitting her next to me. A single tear rolled down her recently cleaned cheek. I reached over and wiped it off.

“S-sick?” More tears had started to fall. She seemed more upset at the fact she wouldn't be able to visit her little friend rather than the fact that his mother was sick.

“Yes

“The hopital?” She asked

“Yes, okay? Then we can start going over to Chuckie's again, okay Princess?” I lied about Melinda getting better soon. Her illness was terminal. She would spend the rest of her life in that hospital. That just isn't something you can tell your two year old child. She sniffed again and started to wipe the tears from her eyes.

“Promise?” She asked

“Of course

“Okay daddy.” She said

“What is it?” I asked. Her eyes started to tear up again.

“I love you.” She said. One last tear traveled down her cheek. I walked back to her and picked her up

“I love you too Angelica, turning out her light and plugging in her night light.  I left her room and walked to my study, where I sat in silence for a few hours. It was past midnight when the door opened.

“Drew?” The voice pierced the silence, she just had a lot of pride. Before Angelica came into the picture, Charlotte and I tried our damnedest to have children. It never worked. We never found out if we were just unlucky, if she was infertile, or if it was my fault. Well, I suppose it wasn't my fault, Angelica proved that.

From the moment I got custody of Angelica, trying to close deals at that Merge Corp she worked at. She poured all her energy into that job of hers. At night she would fall asleep almost instantly, without even talking to me. The worst was that she was cold and distant to Angelica too. I could tell by Angelica's expression when Charlotte talked to her, or didn't rather, that this hurt her. I tried talking to Charlotte, but to no avail.

She walked across the room to my desk, but she quickly looked away. “What are you doing in here?” She asked sternly, “It is after midnight.”

“I know Charlotte, she isn't going to last long. I told Angelica that Melinda would be just fine and she could start visiting Chuckie again very soon. Do you think it was wrong of me to lie to her Charlotte?” I spoke quickly, telling her what had been bothering me the past few hours. Charlotte sighed and looked at me again. This time I saw a hint of pity.

“She is a child, she sighed heavier, and crossed her arms again. “Besides, this wouldn't be the first time you lied to a girl.” I looked at her, confusion on my face.

“Charlotte, “Who have I lied to?”

“Jesus Drew, “I am talking about me. What was it you said in those wedding vows? That you would give me your deepest love and your fullest devotion! And now... now some bastard child comes into your life and-”

“Charlotte, fine! But do not take it out on her. She is just a child. And don't call her a-”

“Daddy?” Angelica was at the door. Charlotte and I had woke her up. Tears were streaming down her face once again. Charlotte took this opportunity to recompose herself and storm out of the study, knelt down, and put my hand on her shoulder. I used my other hand to wipe her tears away.

“Angelica, we will be just fine. We just need to get you back to bed, okay?” She sniffed again and nodded her head. I picked her up and carried her back to her room. I placed her back into bed and tucked her in. I kissed her on her forehead. “Goodnight Angelica, daddy loves you.” I said softly, before walking towards the door.

“Daddy, sat on the edge of it, and looked into her eyes.  

“Angelica, “Mommy and Daddy both love you very much. We also love each other very much. There is nothing you can do to make us not love you or each other. Now get some sleep, okay?” She nodded and closed her eyes. I kissed her one more time and walked out of the room. That night I tossed and turned restlessly on the couch. I had no desire to lay next to Charlotte. My mind kept turning to Cynthia White.

She curls herself into a ball, covers herself with a blanket, and finishes whatever film she's watching.

Moving down the hall Quincy could almost feel himself growing wet; not because of his need to urinate

Being a shared bathroom with almost thirty college level men, and the whole bathroom smelled of piss. The stifling humidity caused by the showers only amplified it. Washing your hands almost seemed like a waste, not that the Neanderthals Quincy lived with would do that anyway. Not even a rinse most times. The yellow light cast by the fluorescents in the ceiling was the piece de resistance to this dystopian like bathroom. 

Stepping up to one of the two pube ridden urinals

He was just about finished with his business when one of the men to his right spoke. It sounded like nothing to Quincy at first, its auto-flush taking away what he had brought. Slightly curious about shower man, but not enough so to investigate, Quincy walk back towards the hair covered sinks. With little warning, the man in the shower began screaming at the top of his lungs. 

Quincy stopped halfway to the sinks, however. The scream kept on for a few seconds then was abruptly cut off by a very loud, wet, smack. It reminded Quincy of the times he and his brothers would take their rotten Halloween pumpkins and smash them on their driveway. With his curiosity aptly piqued, he walked back to take a look around the stalls. The scream had come from the shower at the end, but he couldn’t see anything from where he was standing.

By now, looking like he meant to kick someone’s ass. He ripped the curtain back, but didn’t like what he saw. His face quickly drained of all color and he stepped back from the shower.

“What is it?” Quincy asked. He had clearly seen more than just a naked guy. The red head stammered to say something, Quincy walked toward the shower to see what was in there. He heard the red head heaving in the toilet. Genuinely perplexed now, he pulled back the first shower curtain.

The showers were set up so that there were two areas. The first had a curtain separating it from the outside and a curtain separating it from the actual shower. Quincy liked to call this the staging area. It was fully tiled and had a towel hook on one side. Beyond the staging area and the second curtain was the actual shower. The showers were not very ergonomically designed; barely large enough to move around in and the shower heads put out enough water pressure to fight fires. What should have been a white plastic floor with drain was now jaundice yellow from years of sweaty feet trampling it.

The staging area had flecks of blood and what had to be skin hanging from the ceiling, however, was gone; still in the shower, just no longer attached to him. The walls and ceiling were coated with gore, bone, blood, and bits of hair. What must have been part of his scalp was now hanging off of the shower head.

Quincy did not know what to do with what he was seeing. He saw it

He heard something from his right that snapped him back to reality. It was a ticking noise, it seemed. The red head stuck his head out of the stall he was in, looking to Quincy to see if he heard it too.

“What the hell happened to him? What’s that noise? What’s happening?” The red head stammered with a bit of bile running down his chin.

“He popped

“Is he dead?” 

“Yeah

He stopped to listen for a second. “Yeah

“I don’t know. It started after…”

The ticking started to grow more intense seemingly at the mention of it. What was once a hard to hear tick was now becoming much louder and more intense. The Geiger counter was getting closer to some much nastier stuff.

“We should leave, he reasoned. 

“Right

The red head took the lead as they both quickly made for the exit. As they rounded the urinals and came into sight of the mirrors and sinks along the wall, but what he saw killed whatever shock was dulling him before. 

What looked like the body of a jackal with a human face stood on its hind legs and watched them in the mirror

Fight or flight took over with flight winning. Quincy pushed against the red head to get him moving. He didn’t need much encouragement to make a rush for the door. Somehow managing to not trip over each other they made it through the doorway and back into the bathroom. No, we just left here. This can’t be real! Red head realized the same and tried to turn around to leave again. Quincy got in his way so he shoved him aside looking out for number one. Quincy was not a very physical guy and red head was. Tripping over himself, Quincy cracked his head on one of the sinks and everything went black. 

His eyes opened back up. His face felt stuck to whatever he was laying on. Bolts of pain ran through his head as Quincy tried to put together where he was and why his head hurt so badly. Peeling his face off the sticky floor he took in his surroundings; still in the bathroom. Maybe he had simply smacked his head and all of that was a concussion fueled nightmare. Only seeing a black and white blur for a second he pushed himself up and took in his surroundings. 

He certainly was in the bathroom. The smell and humidity assured him of that. No matter how many blows to the head he took he’d always recognize that smell. Touching the side of his head he could feel blood running down a scrape on his forehead. He almost wiped it on his pants then remembered there was the paper towel dispenser. Incredible that no one came in here while I was out. It’s not even past nine yet. With another burst of stars he pushed himself up and made for the towels

As his head cleared he saw the jackal sitting on the other end of the room watching him with eyes too big for its “human” face. Though the disemboweled corpse of the redhead sat next to it in a pool of blood it bore no look of malice towards Quincy. It only watched him, was not as curious. Forgetting about the towels he ran for the door only to find it closed and locked. Pulling with all of his might he could not force it. Tears had started to build in his eyes. Had he not already gone to the bathroom he would have soiled himself.

The ticking began again. Quincy pounded on the door, anyone, to help him. It pawed his shoulder. 

Quincy ducked down and ran back towards the showers. There was nowhere to run to, almost falling again, the stench of decay hit him. The stalls and showers were gone. The ceiling was gone. The walls had been replaced with bloated, rotten corpses. Where the ceiling had once been was now a crimson red sky, full of billowing black smoke. What had started as a trip to the bathroom had become a journey to a land of nightmares. Crazily he thought, I’ve surely been booted by the admin by now.

His grip on sanity was shaking now. Dropping to his knees all he could do was wait for the jackal to come for him next. Within seconds, but incredibly dry. Quincy could feel incredible heat, not only from the outside, but from the inside of his chest. The ticking was louder than ever, drowning out all other noise. He could feel the jackal leaning in closer to him, putting its face up to his ear. His quickly breaking mind did nothing to try to stop it, nothing to force his legs to run

With a raspy voice, now.”

1368815907.0,1ej6sj,Death Marriage,Vital_Vertigo,55,9,12,"
During my junior year of college, so I figured it would be a great way to improve my spoken Chinese.
I began my language classes at the beginning of September, I needed to make lots of Chinese friends. I made lots of friends, but I became particularly close to one girl named Ying Ying. We had a lot in common: movies, books, TV shows, and music artists; it was surprising how many similar interests we had.
However, “I can’t go out tonight, because my grandmother told me last night that if I go out tonight, I’ll die.” I didn’t really believe in any of that stuff- my interest in that sort of thing is just for fun, but Ying really believed in all of that.
I met Ying Ying at the beginning of October
One day we were in a coffee shop discussing these types of things
“No
“It’s an old Chinese custom. If a family had a son that died, so that they would have a wife in the afterlife.” She told me
“Well that’s not so weird. Lots of cultures had women who volunteered to be killed for a dead man.” I mentioned Scandinavia and India
“These girls weren’t volunteers.” She explained. “The parents of the sons would often find dead girls
“That’s freaky shit! Was this legal?” This freaked me out.
“Well it was… frowned upon
“You’re shitting me.”
“I shit you not.” She told me. She then started telling me the legend of how it became illegal. “During the Tang Dynasty, and he was one of the imperial army’s most promising officers. Well, one day, Yang Sen was out on patrol with his soldiers, when a snake spooked his horse. He was thrown from the horse, and he snapped his neck.”
“Wow that must have been embarrassing.” I mocked.
“Shut up! I’m not done. Anyways
“Wait a sec
“This is story is where we get our word for witch. Now shut the hell up and let me finish! Anyways, the witch was found nailed to a wall in her home and her head was sitting in the window. Yang Sen’s parents were found dead the next day; they’d been killed in the same fashion. However, some of the servants said that they saw Yang Sen and Huang Lei, walking and holding hands, in the house the night before. Vengeful spirit rumors spread through the city like wildfire, so the emperor officially declared the practice to be illegal. Some people say that the spirits of this dead couple still wander the streets of Xi’an.”
For me, this was the uncut version of the city’s history. “So, do you actually believe this story? I mean, you’re you and all.”
She looked at me with kind of “you dumb-ass” look on her face and said
I wasn’t really convinced so I just smiled agreeably and nodded my head. She had a right to believe what she wanted. Besides
A few days later, so it would be something new for both of us. We visited the area around Da Yan Ta (Giant Wild Goose Pagoda). While we were walking, Ying stopped and was silent for a long time. She was looking straight ahead, but I couldn’t see anything. She was terrified of something, there was no mistaking it, but I had no idea what. She began to tremble; then she began to cry. By this point I was getting uncomfortable. “Ying, what’s wrong?” I asked.
She didn’t look at me. She just said “Can’t you see them?”
“See who
Without looking at me, he even had a sword. The longer I looked at them, the more I realized that there was something way off about these two, more than just the fact that they were dressed in traditional Chinese clothes. The man’s face was expressionless, but the woman’s face was horrible. There was an unmistakable fury in her face, and she was pointing at Ying. When she saw that I was staring at her, she drew the man’s sword from his sheath and pointed it directly at me.
That’s when Ying let go of my face and ran. She didn’t stop, I thought; then I turned around and ran after Ying.
That happened in early November
The nightmares began about a week after that. At first they were just nightmares about the story that Ying told me. I didn’t really lose too much sleep over them, “Let’s not talk about that,” and she’d change the subject.
When December, complaining that I was screaming in my sleep. Every night I had the same dream. I dreamed that the couple came into my dorm room, and the man nailed my roommate and I to the wall next to our beds. The woman would then take the sword out of his sheath, and stab us to death. 
The night terrors began the first week of December
I was having this dream every night. The worst part about these dreams was that I didn’t wake up right before the woman began stabbing me. I felt every bit of it
Because of this damn dream, I think I started to hallucinate. I began seeing the couple in the corner of my eye, at the end of a large crowd, in shadows, and sometimes I’d even see my teachers as the woman. I decided that when Christmas break came, I was going back to the US. I hadn’t been planning on returning home until August, but I figured that a vacation would be healthy.
That’s when I found out that, so I wasn’t getting a break until then. What was even worse was that I had exams the week of Christmas. On top of that, I was being tormented every night by the same night terror. 
The dreams didn’t stop. My grades suffered, as usual, she tried to change the subject, but this time I didn’t take no for an answer.
“Cao ni ma! Don’t you dare change the subject this time! I’m having night terrors every night; I can’t sleep! Hell
Ying hesitated; she kept looking to her left
I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I figured that extremely realistic night terrors were possible
Ying began crying. She was so horrified. She knew exactly what was going on. Now I realize that she was right. She grabbed my face and turned it to my right. That’s when I saw them. They were standing right at the end of my booth
I screamed and jerked free of Ying’s hands. Everyone in the coffee shot turned and looked me like I was crazy. Only now I knew that I wasn’t crazy. Ghosts were real
We left the coffee shop immediately. Ying went with me to my dorm to help me pack. We went to the airport together, but she wasn’t sure. I was hoping, praying, that she was right. My flight was first so I left.
That was January 2nd
When I returned to America
I woke up on January 6th
When I awoke
“Hey is everything back to normal?” I asked. After several minutes
“You need to read this.”
I read the article. The article was about several murders in our university. The victims were her roommates and my roommate. I was mortified. I felt responsible. We should’ve warned them about our dreams. What was worse was that there were pictures of the killings. Our roommates were nailed to the walls next to their beds, “Where are you?”

     That's what I thought happened when I met Emerson Clark. He was tall, and I got to be very close to him. For a while, I was pretty sure Emerson and I were going to get married. I would be Mrs. Clark, we'd have sweet, well-behaved children, we'd live in a cute little cabin on the outskirts of a pretty town, and we'd live happily ever after. 

     That was in high school when I thought that. Things became very different when we graduated and moved into an apartment together.

     Much to my surprise, he'd give me monosyllabic answers to everything I asked him. ""How are you feeling?"" ""Fine."" That was his favorite. ""Fine."" He said it all the time. We were on our own, we were financially unstable, and I had just received three refusal letters from colleges I had applied to, but everything was just ""fine."" 

     As weeks turned into months and years, and hating each other. I missed high school. I missed my family. I missed our old relationship. But there was no way to rewind time. We were adults now, and if that meant staying together just so that we can keep the apartment, that's what it meant.

     ""Em

     ""Ham.""

     ""We can't afford ham

     Emerson glared at me. I knew what it meant. It meant I'd have to go get a ham. It didn't matter that we were dirt poor in a shitty apartment and that it'd only put us another twenty eight bucks into debt, something bad would happen. I sighed, grabbed the same purse I had been using since high school, and headed out the door. Once I was in the car, I checked my wallet. Emerson had taken my cash. I went to the ATM and withdrew twenty eight dollars. Surprisingly, I didn't get the usual ""insufficient funds"" pop-up. Maybe Emerson had finally gotten a paycheck. I headed to the grocery store, bought the cheapest ham I could find, Emerson would know. He watches me.

     I walked up to our apartment and open the door

     ""Change?""

     ""There wasn't any."" I replied. ""Ham is expensive.""

     ""Gimme the receipt.""

     I handed it to him. He scanned it over, set it in a baking pan, slid it in the oven, and let it cook.

     Between me putting the ham in the oven and whatever else was on Emerson's mind, and only his own. Blood- my blood- dripped to the ground from my shattered nose and jaw as I lay on the dirty carpet, hoping Emerson would go to bed. He didn't. By the time I no longer felt his knuckles embedded in my face and stomach, both of my eyes were swollen shut. One of my newly broken teeth pierced through my lip and tongue. I felt a tear in my ear as I heard Emerson snatch his coat from the couch and stormed out the door.

     ""You'll regret doing that

     The door slammed shut. I was alone. I felt my way to the kitchen and opened the oven door. The ham was burned. I wept.

      ---

     The next morning, little did he know, I watched him, too. I didn't know exactly where he went, but I didn't need that piece of information. I drove to a familiar building, parked, and walked inside.

     Other people were there, dried blood still caked on my face. I strode past them, to the stairwell, and continued downstairs. The basement was cold and dark. I flipped the lights on, and a thousand creatures simultaneously flinched and yelped.

     People were chained to the walls as far as my eyes could see. The basement extended far, tried to crawl away from the light. My products. The scrawnier ones could be sold into sex trafficking, but the ones with more meat on them had far more uses. Sex slaves, free labor, and if they were uncooperative, they would be butchered and sold as pig or cow meat. People other than my own employees were down here; probably pimps, looking for new material. A curvy woman dressed in satin selected a scrawny young man from the multitude. An employee nodded, and accepted a small wad of cash from the woman. The man would be fed until he was at a healthy weight and then delivered to his new master. As he was unchained from the wall and  taken to a prep room

1337276888.0,tryb4,Creepy Pokémon Blue...,RubberBallsAndLiquor,55,8,29,"I want to tell you something that happened to me. It happened some time ago, I promise. I just want to tell you it.

It all started about two years ago. I was at a Pokémon convention in my town. I have always loved the gamand TV shows since I was young, I left for the convention.

It was a gorgeous sunny day. Sure, and to re-live my youth. Looking through my Pokémon Red file from fourteen years ago brought back so many great memories - stupid nicknames I had given Pokémon and just the great lengths I had gone to trying to collect all Pokémon and complete the game.

I thought I would try and battle some people. Sure, and felt lost amongst the Nintendo DSs, but there was a corner where people were battling old-style. I battled a few and got my ass kicked every time. There were some I nearly won, but these people were obsessed, and far better trainers than I was. I still had fun, though, and was nearly going to leave, maybe only twelve years old, with an old Pokémon cap on. He was very reserved and was waiting for someone to battle. I pulled up a stool and introduced myself. ""I'm Kevin"", and clearly played the game a lot. His team was pretty vanilla - a Dugtrio

I had decided after the fun I had that day at the convention that I would get back into Pokémon again, just some levelling needed to be done. For some reason, I couldn't get that kid out of my head. It was something about the look he gave me when I left. Whenever I thought about it, I got chills, and the feeling of death came upon me. Although I had began this new task enthusiastically, I soon grew bored of levelling Pokémon, and I had a lot of exams I needed to be doing for college. A few months passed by, until a local newspaper suddenly brought everything back to me.

I was doing my daily routine of buying coffee and a newspaper, I caught something in one of the back pages. This was the obituary section, and there is sometimes a picture of the person deceased. I could now see a grainy picture of the kid I met at the convention, and a small paragraph about his passing due to an ongoing battle with cancer. Having not thought about this kid for a while, I was shocked, and although I had only met him once, he seemed nice and I was genuinely saddened. That's why he looked so frail

It sort of ruined my day, I decided to turn on the GameBoy Color. It started normally enough, and as the intro with Gengar and Jigglypuff came up, I remembered the fun I had at the convention with Kevin, and how he whooped me with his Gengar. I felt like I would complete my Pokédex for him, aa a way of remembering him. This was when weird stuff started happening.

My game was getting pretty glitchy. Certain things were happening, and the music would miss certain parts. The glitches got worse the more I played. After a while, Pokémon's colors would change and the text started breaking, looking almost unrecognisable. I started getting creeped out. NPCs would say the wrong things, or were incapable of being interacted with. Sometimes my character would take a step forward when I didn't even touch the GameBoy. It felt like I was being watched the whole time. I didn't like this at all. I decided to turn the GameBoy off, and go to bed. I couldn't sleep much that night, and I started seeing Pokémon in my dreams

The next day, I tried to take the cartridge out, but it was literally wedged in. The thing was stuck and wasn't moving anywhere. In my struggles to try and pull the cartridge out, my hand budged the switch, and the GameBoy turned on. The familiar intro wasn't even there. The titles came straight up, although there was no music. The Pokémon that come on and off the screen next to Blue in the intro, I noticed, Vileplume, but it was almost like I couldn't let go of the GameBoy. I was fixated

The game was almost unplayably glitchy. I was in Vermillion City, a random Pokémon would appear, with running away impossible. My Pokémon were taking quite a beating from these wild Pokémon that kept appearing from nowhere. The music was frightening. It was a distorted mixture of high frequencies and low, ominous undertones. I would try and walk into a building, but the text would come up ""This way is locked. Try again soon."" I am sure that this text was never in the original game. What the Hell was happening to me and my game? I was beginning to get sucked into it. Every move against my Pokémon felt like it was damaging me, inside.

Suddenly, krzp, krzp. I paused the game and looked at my roster. My Snorlax was poisoned! Every time it lost HP, I could feel it inside of me. It felt like something was eating my very soul. I had to get to the PokéCenter. I tried, but still that sign came up again - ""This way is locked. Try again soon."" What does that even mean? When can I enter? The glitches meant I couldn't access my bag. I couldn't even pause the game anymore. I could hear the poison sound inside my head and it was louder than ever - krzp, krzp, krzp. I could feel myself sweating.

""Snorlax died.""

What!? Snorlax died? Pokémon faint

""GENGAR used TELEPORT.""

I don't even have a Gengar! Why was it using teleport? Why was all this happening? The screen faded to black, but the usual message appeared. I tried the Pokécentre. I could enter! This was a small success. When I walked to the desk, the Nurse was facing the back wall, so I couldn't see her face. When I tapped 'A', she turned around, but the sprite was hideous. It was distorted and had red spots under the eyes, as if they were bleeding, the GameBoy made the highest-pitched

This scream snapped me out of my trance. I was so startled that the GameBoy left my hand

Mrs. Stone smiled faintly and waved as she headed back to her apartment. He grabbed a large paper sack out of the trunk and carried it over to the recycling bin. This was a daily ritual for him
 
Jim jogged up the stairwell to his apartment. He was getting home late as usual from a long day at the office. The job always came first, it was writing reviews for his blog.
 
The box was large, just a standard mailing label with a return address somewhere in South America. Upon opening the box he found a large fluffy pillow and a short letter. The letter explained that The Gusano Corperation was looking for popular bloggers to promote their line of pillows. They were Hand crafted from 100% organic materials using renewable resources.
 
Jim scooped up the pillow and fluffed it in his hands. It was light and soft; whoever had woven the cloth was certainly a master of their trade. He couldn't wait to blog about this. He set the pillow aside and tossed the box over by the recycling bin then went straight for his laptop. He made a quick entry thanking his readers for spreading the word about his blog and promising to review the pillow after a good night’s sleep.
 
After responding to a few e-mails and a quick meal, then drifted off to sleep.
 
A wave of pain shot through his body and he rolled out of bed crashing to the floor. The sound of scratching and clawing was deafening. He grabbed at his ear and felt the hot viscous liquid pouring from it. He could feel something burrowing deeper into his flesh. He scraped and tore at it

I’ll tell you now, I used to play in the woods near my home. In the winter months the grass and dirt were a kind of sepia sand color, and only darkened towards the color of the skeleton trees as snow began to melt. Our closest neighbor lived maybe three miles away, and was a good friend of mine. When our parents permitted it, we would visit by bicycle and play in that dense forest that wrapped heavily around both of our little houses. We spent hours together daily during our Christmas holiday. My friend was my age- eleven- and had a thin tuft of chestnut hair and ruddy cheeks. He was chubby like me, and his mother always made him wear gloves. We made a game of swordplay using brittle branches. We parried, riposted, and weaved our way into a myth each day

One day, and we had to sit to catch our breath. “Which way his home?” he asked, snow falling from his mouth. We often ate snow. I glanced about, hoping for a familiar boulder or deadfall. I wasn’t worried, and chose a direction at random. “This way, I think,” said I, I unknowingly led us deeper into that wood

Children either panic too early or too late. An adult usually knows when panic is appropriate, knowing that the blame fell squarely on my young shoulders. 

We decided that it would be best to change directions, he yelled for his mother, he yelled for his father, and he yelled to be heard. To be heard would have been a glorious thing indeed. To be heard would mean some hope to two young boys- to be heard would mean that we were not alone. 

He became enraged. Depending on your age, and it wasn’t until the second angry line appeared that I realized what was happening. My friend had turned on me with his stick-sword. The anger that bubbled through me was threefold. Firstly, I had been attacked by a friend and was hurt by that. Secondly, he was only compounding our problems. Last came the fear-anger that we all know. Charging into a dark room bellowing like a wounded bull is much easier than tiptoeing in. 

I returned the assault, and it was night now. The sound was a wet crunch, much like one is used to hearing when a slushy snowball strikes a fence. I was frightened, and ended my assault abruptly. I turned and yelled fiercely: “Who’s there? Who’s there?” I called to my friend, who didn’t answer me. He must still be cross because I’d laid into him so ferociously. Having spun about so quickly, I fell down. I landed on some deadfall, but it was soft. My hand was in something warm. I know today that it was the head of my friend, but it took me a great deal of time to understand

My god. He was dead. I’d killed my best and closest friend. I hadn’t meant to, he was truly dead. Shuddering with sobs, disgust, fury, and shame, I fumbled for his legs. I couldn’t leave him here; I had to take him home with me. They could fix him, I was sure of it. I’d only drug him deeper and deeper into those woods though, I lay face down next to what was once my best friend. I was still lost, but I wished death on him now since we wouldn’t be found.

I grab my phone and wince at the bright screen. 

2 PM. Damn. 

I don’t think I will ever have a regular sleep schedule. I lay in bed contemplating. Should I get up? Or say fuck it? Today is almost over, I should get up, maybe take a walk.

*Fuck that.*

“I know

I stretch and get out of bed. I take a few steps toward my desk before turning back and looking at my bed. Why does it have to look so warm and comfortable? No

*Now is the perfect time for sleeping!*

“Shut up

*You know

“Yeah

*Fair enough.*

I push the little devil on my shoulder to the back of my mind and browse the internet for a little while before I decide to get ready for the day. I take a shower

*What are you doing all of this for? No one gives a shit.*

I don’t reply. I don’t need to have this conversation with myself. My self-esteem is already in the shitter. I don’t need that asshole making it worse.

*Ignoring me? Tch

I leave my studio apartment to go get food. I should learn to cook

“This should get me through to tomorrow

*Frozen burritos again? Yuuuum.*

“I’m being sarcastic with myself now? Jesus

*Friends? You have me!* 

Ha. Ha ha. At least I can make myself laugh. Pathetic as that sounds.

I make it back to my apartment

“I’m home

*Gasp

I let out a sigh and close the door.

*You know

“I’m not letting you kill innocent people.”

*Bah. I just think you hate having fun.*

“Killing is illegal.”

*HAVING FUN IS ILLEGAL!?*

I let out a laugh

*Nope.*

“Yeah

“What are your plans for tonight

“Same thing I do every night

*Nerd!*

“Whatever.” 

I wonder what’s new with Reddit. I open my internet browser and browse the Reddit front page. One thread catches my eye immediately

*Interesting.*

“There are people who are just as lonely as me posting for hook-ups on the internet? This is interesting. How have I not heard of this before?”

*Maybe because it kind of pathetic?*

“It couldn’t hurt to look. I mean

*Dude.*

“I know. Don’t worry; I doubt anything will come of this. After all

*Attaboy.*

Hours pass as I look at all of the ads. Most of the women are looking for specific things, and a goatee and, well, a body that needs to see a gym. I have nothing else to do though, so I refresh the page.

An ad appears at the top of the list

*“Fat and unattractive

Why is that part in quotation marks? I open the ad. It has pictures.

*Hooooly shit!*

Yeah, dark make-up, bright red lipstick, and dark red long curly hair. Her description says she is five feet and five inches tall. She has a fantastic body. How would I describe it without sounding like a pig?

*Tiny waist, and huge… tracts of land. She’s kind of perfect actually.*

“Yeah, the description of the type of guy is pretty much me.”

*I bet it’s a dude.*

“Yeah

*Nope

“Stop being a pessimist. Look, something I have plenty of.”

*Or we show up and a fat hairy dude jumps out and takes a knife to our chest and we die. That’s a fucked up ending if you ask me.*

“Too late

*Our penis is going to get us killed.*

“Whoa

*Well don’t leave the readers hanging. What does it say?*

“It’s an address and a phone number. In my reply I asked her to send me a picture with her touching her nose so I know she’s not a fake.”

*And?*

“She sent the picture.”

*So... Why are we still here?*

I quickly get ready and leave my apartment. I jump in to my car and punch the address in to my GPS. Fifteen minutes away

I pull up to the house. It’s an old Victorian style two story house. The outside of the house is run down and needs some fixing up; a new paint job wouldn’t hurt either as the current paint is chipping away. There is only one light on in the window.

*Uhh... Remember that bit where I said we were going to die?*

“Shut up

I pull out my phone and dial the phone number provided in the email. 

A soft and very seductive voice answers on the other line

“H-Hi

“Are you here

*Holy shit

“Y-yeah

The door opens and she steps out on to the porch wearing only black lacy lingerie and beckons me inside

*Dude…*

“O-okay

My eyes have not left her since she stepped outside. I hang up the phone

The room is a very spacious living room, a couch which she is sitting on with two end tables on both sides, and a television. This place looks significantly better on the inside than it does on the outside.

She pats the cushion next to her

I obey and sit next her. She looks me deep in the eyes and I can’t look away. She brings her face in close to mine.

“You thirsty?” She asks

This snaps me out of my haze for second, sure.”

She gets up to leave and grab the drinks. My eyes are on her the whole time. When she reaches the threshold she turns and looks at me.

“Take off your clothes

Her voice is so seductive. I can’t help but do what she says. I take off all of my clothes and sit back down on the couch. I am very aroused from the sound of her voice and what she is wearing.

*Is this really happening?*

She returns with two beers and notices that I’m aroused and smiles. She sets the beers down on the coffee table and stands in front of me. She slowly kneels down and puts her hands on my thighs and rubs my thighs and chest. I start breathing heavy; my nerves seemed to have calmed down as my body starts to get warm.

*I cannot believe this is* ***actually*** *happening.*

I keep my eyes on her. She starts to kiss me on my thighs and moves her way up. She leans up and kisses me on the mouth. The kiss is long

*Heaven.*

She takes me in to her mouth. My eyes roll in to the back of my head and I lean back as pure ecstasy over takes my body. I feel like I’m on drugs. I can’t keep my eyes open because everything is blurred and moving fast. I don’t mind though I enjoy the sensation. I look down at her

*Dude.*

“Shut up.”

*DUDE!!!*

“What the hell

*SHE HAS A FUCKING KNIFE!*

What? My eyes shoot open and I look down at her. Sure enough she’s brandishing a knife and smiling.

“What the f-“ is all I could let out before the knife plunged in to my stomach.

My vision goes dark. I can hear the knife sinking in to my stomach several times. I can hear her laughing as she keeps stabbing me. I don’t feel any pain

*Why is it so dark and cold?*

“Am… Am I dying?” There is an echo inside my head.

“H-hello?”

Nothing.

“Did… did I just die?”

No response.

Fuck.

1364851933.0,1bgion,The Pump,riseofthenorth,64,22,6,"Hey guys

I go to University in The Maritimes. To help pay for rent and excessive drinking I got a part-time job doing campus security. I got the short end of the stick when signing up for shifts and got stuck with the 0400-0800 Monday which sucked until I got used to waking up at 3AM. Honestly, and then spend the rest of my time on my computer shitposting on anonymous message boards.

Part of the reason that these shifts are empty is also because the ambiance of the school at night freaks people out. The campus is pretty old and has burned down twice so it has a lot of old foundation that it’s built upon. Because of the structural instability of a lot of the old rooms

Anyway, and rainy this time of year. Tonight was no exception. When I arrived on campus to relieve the other two workers at the time (we take shifts in twos), they told me that I was going to have fun this shift.
“The pump is broken

What the fuck is ‘the pump’? 

Apparently, so in a way I was kind of excited to get to explore it.
One of the workers showed me to the room which located at the front of the campus by the library. It was down a flight of stairs that I had never noticed before despite it being in plain sight. It’s weird how the human mind is able to gloss over things like that when it’s not looking for them (like that figure that you just saw move from the corner of your eye). I digress.

“You’ve really gotta struggle with this lock

Finally she got the door open and we stepped into the pump room. Most light switches are dinky little things that you just ‘click’ to turn on

http://i.imgur.com/ankTEUC.jpg

One of the first things that struck me was how incredibly cold it was in there. Usually coming in out of the rain makes one feel a bit chilly at first, concrete walls, rusty pipes, and a bunch of rubber tubes. The second thing I noticed was that at the end of the room was a basin with dimensions comparably to a living room sofa.

http://i.imgur.com/bbN3VUy.jpg

“Wow

“No idea, handing me a long pipe that was propped against the wall. I shoved it into the water, yet couldn’t find the bottom. I turned on the flashlight on my phone yet still couldn’t see very far past the surface. Wherever the basin led to it didn’t seem like light could reach it. 

“The basin fills with water from the campus through that rusty pipe on the side there. Flip that switch to drain the water levels and wait about 5 minutes for it to reach that line. Then

We locked up the room and left.  She went home and I went back to the office. 

An hour later, I’m using them here too) didn’t know how the pump room worked and since explaining it to him would involve him coming with me, I volunteered to do it by myself. If you’re reading this story, you know this was a BAD IDEA.

It was still raining when I made my way over to the pump room. I opened the door, it begins to stare back at you. I thought it was funny that there were two faint pale circles in the water. I moved a bit closer to see if I could figure out what they were.

And then they blinked.

I screamed and stumbled back, I can’t say whether I was imagining it or whether something was pushing back against the door. Finally I managed to get the door locked and I breathed a momentary sigh of relief...until I realized that the pump was still on.

It was raining harder now and I was standing ankle deep in a puddle outside of an underused maintenance room. Leaning against the heavy metal door

“I’ll give it another minute. Hopefully whatever’s in there, flip the switch, and run out.”

So I waited

After enough time had passed

Nothing.

So I opened the door a crack and looked inside.

Nothing again.

I flung open the door, towards the door, I heard a commotion of something knocking over the tubes and pipes. I turned and saw it.
It was a gaunt and skulking figure, jutting vertebrae. It was an evolutionary accident. A biological impossibility. The thing flailed and scurried out of the door. I stood paralyzed.

I waited again.

The sound of pounding rain somehow soothed me as I stood intensely watching the blackness of the door, and sprint towards the office.

When I got back inside I was soaking wet

“Dude

Dubs laughed and teased me about it. There is nothing as terrible as someone not believing you

“Ahaha

An external round is essentially a check of the perimeter of the campus. We look for broken windows, etc. As usual, we started at the back of the building by the garbage disposal to come around to the front where the library and pump room are. Still on edge, I was comforted slightly by the presence of another human being. I pushed open the back door and beheld that it was absolutely pouring rain. Like, real torrential stuff here, I could hardly see. I put the hood up on my coat and walked out the back door to the garbage disposal with my co-worker behind me. 

http://i.imgur.com/dq6GLXW.jpg?1

I squinted to try and see through darkness with the water pouring over my face

I backed up and realized that the door was closed.

“Where the fuck is Dubs?!” I pulled on the door. 

Locked.

The thing noticed me and turned what I can only assume was its head in my direction.

I began to pound on the door behind me

The door opened and I slipped inside backwards as fast as possible

“Whoaaa buddy

“W-we can’t use this door.”

He laughed and told me to step aside. He opened it and

I’m still shaken up by the whole thing, but what the fuck do I say? Do I tell them that something came out of the basin? I have no evidence whatsoever and honestly, I’d rather just forget it and move on. 

I’m not sure I’ll be able to do that though.

That thing is still out there.",self,t5_2rkx4,1365002209.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1bgion/the_pump/

Let's begin by enstablishing the fact that I'm an atheist. I don't believe in an almighty god or a Jesus Christ who posessed supernatural powers. I hope that this won't stir up talk of whether there is a god or not in the comments, this happened about a year ago when I was having trouble falling asleep. I was just looking up at the ceiling, thinking about various things (like the possibilities of time-travel and jumping between different universes, that kind of shit) and suddenly, I thought about a concept that defied all that I had been taught: what does hell look like, and what is its purpose? I created mental images of spikes, fire and suffering, things you find in our world? Why not something that humans can't even begin to describe? Wouldn't that be more fit for a realm of chaos? Thinking about these things

In the dream, like a child, but it had black, crooked horns and a tail. He said with an adult voice: ''So, I guess you had some questions to ask.'' It startled me to see a child speak with such a low voice, but I asked him a question: ''What is hell?'' He smiled like he had known what I was about to ask. ''Follow me, I will show you.'' Now, I knew this could never happen in real life and I knew I was dreaming, I was somewhere else. It was another room, it was like the room itself was suffering and shivering beneath my feet.

I just stood there for a while, I felt something rip through my intestine and exit through my mouth. It was a spear. I gasped for air, but felt my lungs leak it out when I did. The spear had impaled me and I was unable to tilt my head up or down. I felt my feet come off the ground as I was lifted up, suspended on the spear, like the others that I now saw. Those devils were holding people up on spears, just like the one that was holding me. There were hundreds of people there, children, all kinds of people. And all of them were sobbing

I was panicking. Was this really hell? Had I died? What was going on here, but I think my demon heard my thoughts, because he let me down. ''They are what powers the world. They burn so that others can be born.'' I heard him, but could not focus my mind enough to really think about what he had said. My lungs were aching, full of blood that I was desperately coughing out. ''Why am I here!?'' I screamed with a pathetic, broken voice. He smiled and answered: ''You wanted to know. And all you had to do was ask.'' I stood up and he pointed the spear he was holding at me. ''Time to go back up. Can't keep the mistress waiting.'' I was crying and backing away in despair. ''Good!'' he said. ''The ones willing to escape last longer! The ones who give up just rot away for eternity.'' I turned around and started running. The other demons didn't seem to mind me getting away, and just stood there watching. I saw some holes in a nearby flesh wall

It was wet and dark, and finally saw some light. I exited into another room of flesh walls. This time, no demons or suffering people. I was relieved. But then I saw something that scared me more than those little demons I had seen earlier. It was a woman with the lower body of a spider. It was holding something in its hands. It was a baby. The monster looked at the baby for a while, examining it. I noticed a pile of babies next to that monstrous thing. A pile of motionless, pale, dead human babies. I felt like throwing up. All I wanted was to get away from this place, but how? Another hole opened on the other side of the room. It was my way out

I started slowly creeping closer to the spider lady, and heard the voice of that demon in my head: ''That direction is for the unfit children. It leads to the chamber of our mistress, where they are raised to be like us. These children come from your world you see. They are the ones that are not wanted, and are brought down here. Sometimes we let them back up though, to be given another chance.'' I was listening to his words and it made me think about something: Was I not wanted? Is this why I was sent down here?

I finally got to the hole, nothing. It was like that whole thing had never happened. Then I heard that demon's voice: ''You got your answers. I hope you are satisfied. Come see me again sometime. All you have to do is ask.''

After waking up with a jolt, the brunette swung her legs over the side of the bed and heaved herself up. Checking the time on her phone, she snorted when she saw it was midnight- the witching hour. Knowing that sleep would only evade her, she left her bedroom for the kitchen, a good cup of coffee on her mind.
As she passed by her front door, focusing again on the coffee plan. Measuring out scoops, water, and preparing her cup kept her occupied, but as the dark liquid boiled, she had nothing left to keep her mind from wandering off. The chill returned and she couldn’t help but glance behind her to the front door. It stood there innocently enough, just like always.

The creature was drapped in a black suit, somehow manking the thing more nightmarish to her. The icing on the proverbial cake, however, was what passed as the hellish thing’s face. It was as though her mind blurred the ghastly visage to spare itself further shock and horror.
She shoved herself away from the door with the hand still pressed against it. The scalding mug of coffee fell, that her mind hadn’t been playing tricks on her. As she crab walked away from the door, she watched as tendrels as black as the void she first saw snake around through the cracks. The girl was trapped between the instinct to flee and the gut feeling to not turn her back on the door. When the door jolted, the urge to flee overcame her and she slipped in the burning liquid as she tried to make it back to her room.
She knew deep down that she was trapping herself in a corner

At first I thought it was just the mist. Cold

That was four days ago. 

I got up and looked out the window. I remember thinking to myself that traffic was going to be a bitch. I took a shower...I remember the water was cold...not cold like how you would think water is cold because the water heater stopped working. It wasn't even really ""cold""...like temperature wise. It was just flat. That's the only way I can think to describe it. Like how a soda gets flat if you leave it sitting out for a long time. Only the water felt..flat..like all the energy had just been sucked out of it. I got out without washing my hair. 

I went in the kitchen and that's when I noticed how quiet the world was. It was still gray outside, the neighbors slamming their doors as they leave. Nothing. I opened the door to the balcony and stood outside. The air felt like it it was just old, like it should have been musty but someone just forgot to add smell. Still no sound. I leaned out over the railing to see better. I could only see a few feet of building on either side of my balcony. The neighbors balconies had the shades drawn on both sides. 

I went back in and turned on the television and there was...nothing. Not even static

I grabbed my keys to head outside and had unlocked the deadbolt

Nothing. It should have been the hallway of my apartment building...but it was just more gray. Like the mist had gotten inside the building somehow

I just locked my door back and stood away. The door creaked like something heavy leaned against it. 

I tried calling the police, my work. There's no signal well, there's a signal. But no calls or messages go through. There's no facebook or twitter or news. I can load the internet but it's like no one decided to put up anything new that day...or the next...or the next. 

I tried to sleep, or move. Everyone justs stands completely still and says nothing. I thought the movie froze but the timer keeps going. All the movies do the same thing. The first screen or preview loads in complete silence and the characters just stand completely still and mute. Two hours later, the credits start rolling. 

It's also hard to sleep because the only noise I do hear is the walls and the windows and the door creaking. I can feel it too. It's like...outside is just squeezing in

I turned on the television about an hour ago. I turned the volume up as far as it would go and just flipped through every channel of gray not shit trying to hear anything. On channel 706

The windows are bulging in so hard in the frames that they look like lenses now.

Let loose every insult you can think of to this boy, have no mercy on his torment. After you have insulted him enough he will reach into his pocket and pull out a ribbon, with two letters on it. Recite the two letters from the ribbon and accept it. Next the boy will hand you a blade, dig the blade into him

It was a car accident. Nothing particularly remarkable, trust me.

And that's when you met me.

""What... what happened?"" You asked. ""Where am I?""

""You died

""There was a...a truck and it was skidding...""

""Yup."" I said

""I... I died?""

""Yup. But don't feel bad about it. Everyone dies."" I said.

You looked around. There was nothingness. Just you and me. ""What is this place?"" You asked. ""Is this the afterlife?""

""More or less

""Are you god?"" You asked.

""Yup."" I replied. ""I'm God.""

""My kids... my wife

""What about them?""

""Will they be alright?""

""That what I like to see

You looked at me with fascination. To you

""Don't worry, your marriage was falling apart. If it's any consolation, she'll feel very guilty for feeling relieved.""

""Oh

""Neither

""Ah

""All the religions are right in their own way

You followed along as we strolled in the void. ""Where are we going?"" ""Nowhere in particular

""So what's the point, right? A baby. So all my experiences and everything I did in this life won't matter.""

""Not so!"" I said. ""You have within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives. You just don't remember them right now.""

I stopped walking and took you by the shoulders. ""Your soul is more magnificent, and when you bring it back out, you've gained all the experiences it had.""

""You've been a human for the last 34 years

""How many times have I been reincarnated

""Oh

""Wait

""Well, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come from.""

""Where do you come from?"" You pondered.

""Oh sure!"" I explained. ""I come from somewhere. somewhere else. and there are others like me. I know you'll want to know what it's like there but you honestly won't understand.""

""Oh."" you said

""Sure. Happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own timespan you don't even know it's happening.""

""So what's the point of it all?""

""Seriously?"" I asked. ""Seriously? Your asking me for the meaning of life? Isn't that a little stereotypical?""

""Well it's a reasonable question."" you persisted.

I looked in your eye. ""The meaning of life

""You mean mankind? You want us to mature?""

""No. just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life you grow and mature

""There is no one else, and me.""

You stared blankly at me. ""But all the people on earth...""

""All you. Different incarnations of you.""

""Wait. I'm everyone!?""

""Now you're getting it."" I said

""I'm every human who ever lived?""

""Or who will ever live

""I'm Abraham Lincoln?""

""And you're John Wilkes Booth

""I'm Hitler?"" you said

""And you're the millions he killed.""

""I'm Jesus?""

""And you're everyone who followed him.""

You fell silent.

""Every time you victimized someone, you've done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was, or will be, experienced by you.""

""Why?"" You asked me. ""Why do all this?""

""Because someday

""Whoa."" you said

""No. Not yet. You're a fetus. You're still growing. Once you've lived every human life throughout all time

""So the whole universe

I can see the individual bones of the skin rutting through the skin. The ragged blue material stretches over the back concealing most of the patched up skin but I can clearly see the thick welts and scars that sit half burrowed under the flesh and half raised in ugly mountains. From my point of view I can see its back; I can see two curled up feet with long nails; but I can’t see its face.

I shouldn’t be here. This is a huge mistake. I had taken the opportunity to stay home alone. Thank fuck I thought, time for me to do what the fuck I want. So I had. A beer, huge sandwich, played video games. Chill. Fancied something else, something meaty. Checked the fridge, ransacked the cupboards, nothing decent

Popped another beer and sat down. Played a few more rounds
The cellar it is. Crushed my beer can and walked round to the back door

I wedged the back door open with a block of wood and jogged to the cellar.  Threw open the doors flicked my lighter open and started down the stairs. My father kept his stash of beautifully prepared meat in the cellar and I had my eye on a nice piece of bacon. The bottom step creaked as I left the stairs and I walked the few paces to the back of the room. Small space. Good

I dropped my lighter.

Fuck.
Took a deep breath, I shook it in the dark and stopped. I could hear it.
I heard the thing rattle and scratch the floor. It began to wail

I stayed still. One hand over my mouth
Took a deep breath
And now I’m here. Lighter casting a dim glow on this curled up rancid faceless thing. 

I can’t move. I can’t decide. I looked down at my hand
That was ten minutes ago. Now it lay flat out on the floor its empty sockets locked on mine

I can’t decide.

On the one hand I could eat my dad’s prepared meat

I spent four years like that

It was a Wednesday, even for a week night, with very little traffic and almost no one on foot. The park, as it was most nights, was completely empty.

I turned down a short side street in order to loop back to my apartment when I first noticed him. At the far end of the street, dancing. It was a strange dance, similar to a waltz, but he finished each “box” with an odd forward stride. I guess you could say he was dance-walking, headed straight for me.

Deciding he was probably drunk, and wearing an old suit. He danced closer still, until I could make out his face. His eyes were open wide and wild, head tilted back slightly, looking off at the sky. His mouth was formed in a painfully wide cartoon of a smile. Between the eyes and the smile, I decided to cross the street before he danced any closer.

I took my eyes off of him to cross the empty street. As I reached the other side

I was completely and utterly unnerved by this. I started walking again

Once I had put about half a block between us, until I noticed him. He had crossed the street, and was now slightly crouched down. I couldn’t tell for sure due to the distance and the shadows, but I was certain he was facing me. I had looked away from him for no more than 10 seconds, so it was clear that he had moved fast.

I was so shocked that I stood there for some time, as if he were a cartoon character sneaking up on someone. Except he was moving very, very quickly.

I’d like to say at this point I ran away or pulled out my pepper spray or my cellphone or anything at all

And then he stopped again

When I finally found my voice, commanding tone. What came out was a whimper, “What the fuu…?”

Regardless of whether or not humans can smell fear, smiling.

And then, very slowly, and started dance-walking away. Just like that. Not wanting to turn my back to him again, I just watched him go, until he was far enough away to almost be out of sight. And then I realized something. He wasn’t moving away anymore, nor was he dancing. I watched in horror as the distant shape of him grew larger and larger. He was coming back my way. And this time he was running.

I ran too.

I ran until I was off of the side road and back onto a better lit road with sparse traffic. Looking behind me then, always expecting to see his stupid smile, but he was never there.

It was a normal day for me 

At 7PM I was finished and started to walk home , ""Hello?"" I yelled , but there was no reply from the man , I heard screaming from behind me it caught my attention so I turned around , turned out it was just some young kids playing about on the street , when I turned back the man was gone and no were to be seen. I didn't think the man was anything to worry about... I would soon find out I was wrong.

I saw him again - 16th Febuary 

It was my friends birthday , he was extremely tall with long slender arms wearing what appeared to be a suit , it was dark so I couldn't tell exactly what the colour of his skin was but he looked awfully pale almost completely white. I thought my illness was causing hallucinations so I when home to sleep.

Researching - 17th Febuary 

The day after I saw the man I called in sick , ' after you see the 'slenderman' you will get nauseous and will eventually experience extreme paranoia ' I had already experienced one of the symptoms. Every story contained a image of this 'slenderman' and it was exactly what I had saw that night ... A tall man wearing a suit , with long slender arms and white skin , but on all these pictures it showed what I didn't see.... It's face . It didn't have one.

The last I remember - 23rd of Febuary 

I was walking through the woodland again to go home , I needed to know who this man with. I followed him I new I shouldn't but I just had to. I had been following the man for a short time when I heared branches snapping behind me I turned quickly to look , but nothing was there. I turned around slowly and was shocked to see a blank face staring at me... He had no eyes. No mouth. No features. I heared static screetching through my ears , and then I collapsed.

I woke up in a hospital bed 3 months later... I had been in a deep coma. The doctors even considered shutting down my life support

I remember that one night I had to stay at my Aunt Janice's house. She lived deep in the country

For the first night in the two story house I was forced to stay in my cousin's old room. Her name was Sierra, when she fell from the window on the second floor. Her bed was nice and comfy, but I hated the decorations she had.

Every shelf in the room was lined with dolls. Not the new Bratz and Barbie dolls

We had mashed potatoes and gravy that evening and I decided to go to bed. I crawled under the warm blankets and the sheet and shut the nearby lamp off.

The dolls were staring at me, I looked back at the maniacal doll that sat above my head. It was dressed in pink baby clothes and seemed to be facing me. I turned around and tried to open the door, finding that it was locked. I pounded on it, my heart beginning to race. ""Someone want to let me out of here?"" I asked. 

My spine shivered at the thought of the baby dolls watching me, smiling. ""What the hell?"" I whispered to myself. I turned around to the door and pounded on it some more. ""Someone let me out of here!"" I shouted. I turned back around, and the doll was further down the bed, and it seemed another doll had moved from the shelf by the window to the window sill. Its hands were on the lock to the window, just barely touching it... It had blonde hair like Sierra did...

I slammed on the door. ""LET ME OUT, eyes widened in fear. ""Why the hell did you lock the door?"" I asked.

""I thought it'd be funny."" she replied. She looked over me and saw the expressionless dolls in their places. ""Playing with dolls?""

""No."" I replied.

""Then explain that."" she demanded

I tried to find words to explain what just happened,""

""Fine

The next night came. After dinner we headed to bed, too tired to stay up and hear her reactions, and passed out.

The next morning I awoke to ambulances outside, your sister is seriously hurt."" 

The worst possibilities came to mind. I bolted upstairs and unlocked the door

Every doll in the room was on its shelf, like they were amused by the open window. I looked over to the top of the bed to see another baby doll... only with long, brown hair, just like my sister's. It smiled maniacally, a far larger smile than any of the other dolls. It pointed to the pillow, and on the pillow was a piece of paper. In dark, blood red ink

""Rock a bye baby
Please save me

I looked away from the writing and bolted over to the window to look out and see what happened. I watched the EMT's zip the body bag over my sister's face. The last thing I ever saw of her was her blank expression... much like a doll... There was a slam behind me. I turned around to find that the dolls were all facing me and the door was closed... Not even the closed door could handle the weight of my fearful

My cousin called me yesterday, but mainly a drink, so I tell him to come home. We’re good friends, even if we don’t see each other much, but I had some beers on the refrigerator and I love the guy, so even if it was late, I had no problem with it. My wife is okay with that too, with our baby. (Rereading that paragraph, they’re fine
So, when he picks it up I notice a bandage on his middle finger. I ask what happened, he says “Later”, so we sit at the desk and play some poker, no bets, just to loosen up. After the second bottle (we have liter bottles down here), he starts talking.
Yesterday he had the night shift at the Emergency Room – he works at a public hospital in Capital Federal, bullet wounds, burned people and lots of alcohol poisoning, he even witnessed a knife fight right there in the waiting room, once. But last night had been quiet, and four hours into his shift, he had only seen one case, it’s 2 am, and leaving a trail of blood at her feet. The lady has to be 50-60 by the looks of her, so they think that due to her age she’s having a miscarriage
At first, the one attached to its belly, and the part where it has been cut has apparently been chewed off. The other umbilical cord, a little bit below the first one, turns out to be the things dick, 4 inches long, almost as long as the things legs. The nurse who should have taken the boy ran off the room, and my cousin goes to clean the baby a bit. The thing’s skin is totally red, nasty wound, there was an actual surgeon there doing the procedures
The mother survived
I don’t want to believe this story, it’s the first one he’s ever pulled on me and he did look scared. But fuck it, he’s probably lying. Right?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update: It was bullshit

The mother came screaming ""It's eating me"" and bleeding, baby was a she (bit about the giant dick was actually reversed, it came with a bit of umbilical cord stuck there and they thought it was a huge dick at first).
Baby did come out with two huge front teeth and bit my cousin, she didn't even know she was pregnant.

My cousin made that story up because he was not ready to tell the real deal

 Nightmares are our greatest fears captured in our thoughts to create a joke of them.

Our fears want us to stay awake. If they scare us awake, then they can't be a nightmare anymore because we aren't dreaming about them. We are going out of our way trying to forget them. They are now a fear again. As a fear, they can now control your thoughts, control what you do


 Your life now revolves around trying to avoid all instances where that fear might come up. You jump at your phone ringing, we not only hears things: we see them too. We see the figures and the faces that have haunted our dreams before. We turn away and when we turn back they are gone. However, when they return they are closer. When we close our eyes, they are are burned into our eyelids. When we blink, our fears inch closer. They reach out to you, trying to catch hold of you. They strain to grab you and get revenge on you for what you did to them. For taking away their power and embarrassing them. For stripping them of their pride and making a joke of them and calling them a nightmare.

What have you done for the one you love? I'd wager a lot of stupid shit. I'm no different. Just some stupid fucking guy who got himself into some stupid fucking situation over some stupid fucking girl. Pardon my language. It's hard to refrain.

I don't know why I'm writing this stupid fucking letter. No one is going to fucking read it. I'm entirely alone. Mostly. I don't know. Alone isn't the right word. It's like the fucking Matrix where I am.

See, and it's not even entirely accurate. The problem is that I've ventured outside the usual jurisdiction of things like language. There literally aren't adequate words to quickly summarize the situation I'm in.

Okay, I've been around the track like 15 times at the time of writing this. I think. I don't know, I lost count.

I know my speech seems disjointed, but I think only the first part went through. It seems like after that first time everything I write or whatever seems to vanish once the reset happens. Like, retroactively or something. But it didn't immediately. I don't know, like I said, words can't really adequately describe the stuff going on because it's not fucking physics.

I guess it's magic? Who the fuck knows. I'll try to explain what happened, now that I think of it.

Basically

College student. Anyways, so I started moving on her which was a lot less creepy than it sounds. Mostly nervous laughter and bad jokes. I'm no fucking Adonis.

Eventually, and this other girl was really weird and shit. Like wiccan or something (again, or so I thought. PLOT TWISTS LATER).

So she totally cursed me. It started small. Little things to fuck with me. I'd lose track of a few minutes at a time. Then shit got weird. The first time I really started to notice something was when the staring started. Basically, then go back to whatever they were doing. It got progressively weirder. People on TV started doing it, etc.

After a few days of maddening terror, not sure where he is now. Probably dead). I was lucky. Really lucky. Because he explained everything to me, instead of killing me. Which will make sense in a moment.

Remember creepy wiccan girl? Not actually a creepy wiccan girl. Nope. Pagan Goddess. She kept falling in love with mortals

If we manage to find someone who's similarly stuck, we will be unstuck. That's how she gets rid of us so it doesn't end up being literally every human being in history stuck in time loops.

Fun fact: I've had 4 attempts on my life in the past 15 years. So I'm also always running. It's like a perverse race: 2 people are desperately trying to find and kill me in the time where our loops overlap

Ah, and I got stuck in a loop between 2012 and 2013. In fact, my loop resets in a week. So this is my last chance before I have to pack up and run again. For the 15th time.

But back to the 2020 thing. Basically

Also, the people affected have started acting differently. It's not really a bewildered stare anymore. Now it's almost like a glare.

1340341828.0,vf84q,"""Never come back to this place.""",AWarmCote,48,12,16,"I was once, to this day

During highschool, there was one drug that completely changed me and my outlook on life: Diphenhydramine, also known as Benadryl.  This OTC medication creates a nightmare in your head when taken in extrmeme amounts. 

The first time I took this drug was very memorable. It started out with me having a very difficult night

At first, the cieling, and me. Everywhere I looked, covered in nothing but that terrifying moving blackness. They spun infinite webs, and crawled from the webs to me. Once they reached me, they would crawl all over my arms and legs, going under my chlothes till they could reach the skin, not able to move to do anything. 

Then the voices came. I would hear completely unknown voices speaking to me in a tounge I had never heard before

I somehow worked up the will to move. I crawled outside my room, somehow hoping that moving from there would take me away from this nightmare. 
	
The next thing I saw immediately froze me in my tracks and sent a shock of fear through me. The spiders disappeared, staring deep, deep inside me. He didn't talk, or move, only stared. What he conveyed through his stare was more than any word, phase, or sentence can convey: Utter, and absolute fear. 
I knew who this was, completely in utter shock. After much time, he started to chukle. Not much like a normal laugh, a very low, gutteral one. He walked over, casting shadows in every direction of the room, and sat down in one of my chairs. He spoke to me. 
	
""Never come back to this place."" 
I woke up in my room
	
Hours later, every once in a while I could make out my name. It sounded like there were many of them, discussing me. Shadows would pass over me, or studder around in the corner of my vision every once in a while. The spiders were still there too, but instead of attacking me, they clung to surfaces, staring at me

This continued for many months. I spent every waking day completely enveloped into my own fantasy, having every day conversations with them until they disapeared. I would shrug it off and continue whatever I was doing. 

I became obsessed with seeing the man I had seen that night. I wanted to know who he was, and they would always act like it was quite strange, and disappear shortly. 

These symptoms of HPPD and skitzopherenia became much more intense as time went on. I began to have terrible memory loss. I would spend days, completely insane. 

One day, I walked into my living room. It was pitch black dark. I heard a faint sound coming from the hallway as my eyes ajsuted to the darkness.  I peered down the hallway. I saw a boy, helplessly crawling across the floor. As soon as he saw me, he froze deep in his tracks. He looked completely helpless, terrified. This humored me.

I started chuckled at the idea that it was so terrifying. I sat down in my chair

My wife’s not here. She asked me if I wanted to join her in browsing for a new washing machine. I told her no. I’d much rather stay at home. She left to find a new washing machine

My father’s not here. He lives with us, bespectacled little man. I love him, but he never says much to me. He’s old-fashioned. He used to cut wood for a living; he earned a nice little living on it. People need wood here, I guess. I never notice the cold. Being old, my father certainly notices the cold, always complaining about it and nagging me to throw some wood on the fire, but I never do. He told me that I would absolutely never listen to him or reason. He’s wrong

My son’s not here. David always has something to do; he never seems to stay in one place very long. He’s sixteen, and I know that’s why he always goes. He asked me if he could borrow my car before he left. I told him no, and he threw his typical fit. He said I always stay inside and never use my car for anything. That’s not true. I used the car just an hour ago.


My dog’s not here. She’s really a puppy, but for some reason I’m the one she’s most attached to. I tell her no each time. She even learned to fetch her leash and bring it to me, as if it were some sort of incentive or to send me on some guilt trip. I always chuckle at her, take the leash, and place it up a little higher, hoping next time she won’t be able to reach it. Her eyes sometimes get me, though: pitiful puppy eyes. She’s such a good actress. She has become less enthusiastic over time, nudging my hand with her wet nose

I’m the only one here. I just woke up…but now I think I’ll go back to sleep. It’s too quiet here.

   At first I thought it was a prank, and it was looking in, staring at me. I walked aruond my house, yelling for whoever it was to come out, but no one was there. The thing is hairless and naked, and it didn’t look like it actually had eyes, or even a face at all. But its head is turned towards me when I enter the room. When I sit on my computer, it’s innocently turned in a different direction.

   Finally on Thursday I tried to open the window

It stared at me

Of course

   I pulled back a fist and smashed it onto the glass, until I thought its head would break in half. It raised its own hand and bashed the window with its palm. It was mocking me. But I saw the faintest crack begin to appear where it had hit, and I backed away. No way did I want that smile in the same room as me.

   So I got a roll of duct tape

It was angry.

   That grin was now a gaping frown full of teeth. The skin had ripped away from its mouth and I coul see down its cavernous throat. A menacing rumble started to fill the house, and it began to smile again. Now it’s night, and the noise hasn’t started again. There are no sounds, no rumble, no crackling glass.

They say he snatches up children when no one is around and bring them to the woods. We all knew this was just a tactic to scare us kids

One night in the summer, parked next to the woods. I was terrified and I'm sure he was too. We sat under the car in silence, waiting for the one who was 'it' to find us. Minutes felt like hours under that car. We waited and waited but we were hidden to well. After about 5 minutes of us hiding there, we heard a honk. It was the kind of honk you hear from the nose of a clown when he squeezes it. I know you may think ""Oh it was just a car horn or bike."" 
No. The woods were thick and you could only go through them by foot. What we heard was the noise of a clown nose. We sprinted for our lives to get away from the woods. A kid hiding near us was running too. The three of us made it back to the group. They said they heard it too. That was the end of us playing at night for a long long time.

Part One

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm sitting here and it's almost 10:00pm. I haven't been able to sleep at all the last few nights because I'm absolutely horrified of what will happen as soon as I doze off. I tried telling my parents about what's been happening, and I quote, ""You should go try out for The Walking Dead."" What an asshole. That's the last thing I want to hear right now.

At this point, but I was feeling extremely fatigued and didn't have the energy to do so. Naturally, I don't remember much after falling asleep, but I do recall hearing a faint click and then the fuzz-like sound of my older TV shutting down. You see, I'm still using an old CRT television. I was planning on getting a newer one sometime this month, but at this point, I don't really give a shit about that anymore.

Now, I was the only person in the house. My parents had gone away on a mini-vacation to one of their timeshares, so no one could have possibly turned off the tube. Additionally, I've never seen or heard my TV shut down by itself. It just doesn't happen. I've fallen asleep many times with it on and when I wake up, it is still on.

So, skating off to school and afterwards hanging out with my crew at the mall for a few hours. The day was uneventful, like most other days, but that night was a totally different story.

After getting home from seeing a movie

Wow! You know what? I just realized something. Maybe this is punishment. Maybe I'm being forced to suffer because of my inherent laziness and lack of motivation

Please excuse my ramblings. I mean, I'd just like to say that no matter what happens, I'm going to get this story out. I just hope I can articulate it well enough for you to understand. Please know that it’s hard for me to even write about this. I shudder at the very thought of it…

Ok, I clicked on the TV and flipped through the channels trying to find something interesting and entertaining to watch. Being alone in the house had never bothered me before, but for some reason, I was a little on edge this time around. I really had no idea why. My TV shutting down by itself the night before seemed insignificant; I mean things like that can be rationally explained. No need to be paranoid. Right?

After landing on National Geographic

I remember hearing the same click and fuzz-like sound shortly after knocking out. Normally, static-filled noise at full volume and the screen flashed erratically, lighting up my room like a strobe light would. I quickly reached for the remote with one hand and covered my ear with the other. It was so loud and bright; almost unbearable.

I mashed the power button on the remote, I reached behind the box and yanked the cord from its outlet. Luckily that worked. At this point, my heart was racing so hard, it was difficult to maintain my composure. I put a hand on my forehead and leaned down a bit, trying to calm down. After a few moments, I looked around my room. All was quiet and it was pitch dark, but my retinas still burned from the flashes of light. Now you would think I'd have a hard time falling asleep again after that, casting off the previous event as some sort of glitch. It was far from that

You know, there wasn't a whole lot of ""build-up"" or sugarcoating. This shit hit me like a train after that whole TV incident.

I must have woken up a few hours later. The room was still dark, I tremble even thinking about what happened next.

Let me preface by saying that I've had sleep paralysis before and it truly is frightening how

This was NOT sleep paralysis. I had full control over every limb of my body. The thing is… I couldn’t move regardless. There was someone sitting on my chest, his mouth obviously open.

He sat there motionless for the first few moments, he unexpectedly…

Damn it. There’s a knock at my door. It’s okay - this has happened before. I just need to be real quiet now. I promise I’ll post the rest soon.

Lord

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Part Two

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The knocking on my door continued for well over two hours. It has happened before, to be honest. I could see the shadow of his feet underneath the door. It HAD to be him. There's no one else here, you see. You understand, don't you? Nobody believes me. You do, right?

I will try my best to continue where I left off. When I was lying in bed, I was essentially frozen still. Absolutely rigid. He continued to stare down at me for what seemed like eternity, but then suddenly and without notice he jumped, pushing off of my chest. The pressure was intense, as if my whole torso was being compressed.

As I gasped for air

Still in dismay, except maybe in The Exorcist.

Oh god, he shows up again. Each time more intense than the last.

What the hell does he want? To torment me? Scare the shit out of me? Well

I just want to scream at the top of my lungs. Curse him to hell. But

Shhh. Did you hear that? Fuck

Jesus

I just need to sttaaa… shit. I just needd to staayy awakkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Part Three

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Oh god. Oh god oh god oh god. He came again. I fucking fell asleep. He... he hurt me this time. I can feel the blood streaming down my back. I don't know how many cuts he made

He didn't listen, he was just sitting there, motionless. Staring.

Now... now I know the truth. He wants to kill me. He's going to kill me slowly and painfully.

Jesus

Right now, as promised, but my battery is running low and I don't know how much time I have left.

I'm going to look in the mirror using the screen's light. I have to. I need to see what he did to my skin. Hold on...

What the...? What the fuck?? It says something. He etched words into my back. I can't believe this shit.

Ok

It was really hard to read, it's your demise."" I... wha… what does it mean? Lord help me. Please help me.

I need to stay awake; just for a bit longer. I need to keep my eyes open and stop myself from nodding off. But how? I'm trapped in this room. I can't leave. I can't splash water on my face or drink caffeine. All I have is my mind and this laptop with its waning battery level.

I know he's out there in the hallway. He's just waiting for me to mess up and fall asleep again.

My parents won't be back until later tonight. It's only a few more hours

I'm going to needd to figguree somthinng outt. I havvee to sttay awakkkke.

Damn it, I can listen to music or watch something. Yes!! Wait. My battery is at 19% now. Shit, that isn't going to work.

What is your reflection? Science has told us that it’s an image created in our brain from light that reflects off a mirror or another reflecting object. This would mean that whatever you do, but I can assure you that I’m not. I wouldn’t believe any of this either, had I not seen it with my own eyes. It happened when a friend was spending the night at my house, many years ago. We were playing some games late at night, lights off in a complete darkness. The only light source was the faint glow of the tv-screen. Me and my friend were getting hungry, so he offered to make us some food while I kept playing. He went over to the fridge and switched the light on in the kitchen. There was a round mirror in the living-room where I was playing, positioned in a manner that allowed me to see his reflection as he was standing in front of the fridge. He made some sandwiches and asked me what I wanted on mine. I turned my head slightly, holding in one hand butter and in the other jelly. I said I’d take jelly, almost angry. After a while

He gave me a weird look as an answer to my scared expression. I was sure that just a second ago he had been looking at me from the fridge, maybe I should have. We ate and played for a while, then we went to sleep. We were sleeping in separate rooms, across the hall from eachother. I couldn’t sleep, I was still thinking about what I saw. I was up for a good half an hour and nothing happened. Then, I heard a noise coming from down the hall. It was like a choking sound, but muffled. I got up carefully, I know. I was always a bit paranoid) so I took it with me. I walked as quietly as possible down the hall, and felt like the floor had fallen from beneath my feet. There was my reflection

It was pointing behind me. I didn’t know if I wanted to turn around, but there was nothing there. Just the doors to my room, and to the room where my friend was sleeping. His door was open. His door was open? It wasn’t open when I came out into the hallway. I swallowed, and approached his room. It was dark inside, even darker than the hallway. I called out his name, no answer. I approached him to see if he was still there, and laid my hand on the bed. I was glad to feel him there (I don’t know what I expected) and shook him a bit. No answer. I shook him more, and switched the lights on. He was lying there, as well as my friend’s. I didn’t stop

After the incident, mirrors are believed to have the ability of sucking out a person’s soul. They feed on the person’s soul. I think they need to kill them to get the full soul, though. This is why my friend was killed. And this is why I’m warning you. Don’t stay alone with mirrors around. You never know when we get hungry.

1341880105.0,wats7,Quiet - A War Story,roterghost,41,3,3,"I never saw the ocean till I was nineteen, into San Diego and all her glory. The sight of it, plenty big

You can imagine the state I was in when a few weeks later they gave me a rifle and put me on a boat. When I stopped vomiting up everything that I ate, rocking of the waves; I remember thinking that the war had to be a step up from this. Kids can be so fucking stupid.

I had such a giddy sense of glee when I saw the island, just because they asked us to. The lieutenants herded us into our platoons on the decks and briefed us: the island had been lost. That was exactly how he put it. Somehow in the grand plan for the Pacific, this one tiny speck of earth, only recently discovered and unmapped, had gotten lost in the shuffle; a singularly perfect clerical error was all it took. It was extremely unlikely, he stressed, that the Japanese had gotten a hold of it, but a recent fly over reported what looked like an airfield in the central plateau.

We hit the beach in the middle of the night. I’d heard talk of landings before, but it wasn’t we got, that thick, heavy silence. Behind the lapping of the waves and the wind in the trees, there was… nothing, no birds, no insects. Just deathly stillness.


Another hundred yards deeper into the eerie tranquility of the jungle, but I knew enough to know that something was very wrong. It was like the whole island was dead. I remember I could only smell the sea, despite the red blossoms dangling from the trees.

It wasn’t an airfield, and I don’t think anyone ever will. If I tell you it was like the Aztec pyramids, but turned upside down, so that it sank like giant steps into the earth, you’d get the basic idea of it, but that somehow fails to capture the profound unearthliness of the structure.

There was no sign of individual pieces in the masonry, so that it was impossible to see how deep it went, or even focus your eyes on any one part of it, like it was one giant blind spot.

Our platoon drew the honor of investigating the lower levels

At odd intervals down the steps, hollow cubes of stone with one opening, facing the pit in the center. There was no door that we could see, and with the opening being four feet of the ground, you’d have to put your hands on that black razor sharp edge to climb in into it.

We circled the descending floors, the whole monument was immaculate, as if the place was just built; but that couldn’t be right. The whole structure felt incalculably old to me somehow, despite having no way to articulate the particular reasons.

Down near the bottom you could see that it simply sloped away into a darkness that swallowed the flashlights. We tossed first a button and then a shell casing down into the pit, we simply turned away from the yawning abyss and continued our sweep of the bottom rung and the last of the small structures.

The body in the back corner was almost invisible at first in the thick shadows, arms around his thighs, and his face tucked into his knees. You could see badly he was cut, his clothes opened in ragged bloody tatters to reveal the pale skin and bone beneath it. He may have been dressed in a Japanese uniform, but it had been reduced to ribbons; I only had few seconds to look at him before we heard the first shots.

It echoed like the buzzing of faraway insects in the still jungle, and the hot smell of gunpowder in the air, but they were gone. The trees were deathly quiet around, there was not a trace of the nearly fifty other men that had come ashore with us. I could taste bile rising in my throat as panic threatened to cripple me; I felt crushed between the yawning pit and razor edges on one side and the dead jungle and the pounding ocean on the other. The silence rang in my ears and I struggled to still myself.

They were just inside the jungle

I can try to tell you what I saw, and you’ll have the same reaction they did; that I was a dumb country rube suffering from heatstroke and exposure and trauma. That I was crazy.

You know me. You know I’m not crazy. And I remember every second of that night with crystal clarity.

The thing, all mottled with the belly distended from rot. The head drooped, useless and obscene on the shoulders, tongue swollen and eyes cloudy. I could see where it was coming apart at the ill-defined joints, with ragged holes in the drying flesh. At the bottom of each of these raw pits was blackness, deeper than the stones of the buildings; a darkness that seemed to churn and froth like an angry cloud.

The thing moved suddenly, and think absurdly of my mother’s marionettes.

A gun went off beside me, and were pale, fresh, and soaked in blood. More bullets zipped through the air, and I saw the grisly things hit again and again, but they never slowed. I caught a glimpse of the First Sergeant’s vacant glassy eyes as his head dangled limp from his shoulders; I saw the great ragged wound in his back and the shuddering darkness that inhabited his corpse when he leapt just past me without a sound, landing like a graceful predator onto the soldier beside me. The others around me began to drop in a silent dance of kinetic energy and blurred motion

I was on the track team in high school, and it struck a new ringing note of terror in me. I don’t remember actually deciding to swim, but when I turned back to the tree line, I saw one of the white and bloody things emerge, running on all fours, the hands splayed wide and the back contorted and cracked in an impossible angle.

To this day, let the tide drag me out to sea, if only to bring momentary relief from the impossible monolith and terrors on the island. The days I spent drifting off shore and blistering in the sun were a welcome release from the silent island.

I never saw the war. They sent me home as soon as I recovered.

It was comforting in a way, I’ve found that it is pointless to lie to anyone, especially yourself. I know what I saw.

Someone else believed me too. I’ve seen maps of where they tested the hydrogen bombs in the South Pacific.",self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/wats7/quiet_a_war_story/

I know that sound melodramatic and maybe even a little cliché, but some things you don't just walk away from and brush off.

Not the things I've seen. Not after what it did to me.

I don't know what's haunting me. I don't know where it came from, what scares me isn't the fact that I know nothing about this thing, it's that I don't know how long it's been haunting me.

I still see its slender arms. I see them in the trees outside my window. All the time.

It all happened back a few years ago. I had been visiting my friend in the hospital after she tried to kill herself. I was walking down one of the wings when I saw it out the window- it was a man in a suit. I only saw the shoulders and I only saw it for just long enough to not register it before it had disappeared. I don't remember the face, after all.

The second time occurred a few weeks later after that same friend died in the hospital. Doctors never gave the cause of death aside from ""complications"". I didn't ask questions

She looked terrible at her funeral- so sad and grim, I saw it again- a man in a suit, but it wasn't that same man and it wasn't that same suit, if that makes any sense. If not, well, it didn't make sense to me, either.

It wasn't a suit worn to a funeral- it wasn't the kind of person to attend the funeral, I felt like I'd been lifted back up to the hospital and was staring at the man out the window again. I tried to make contact- I tried to address it, I tried to get its attention after the funeral, but once the proceedings were over, it just passed us by. It came so close to me- inches. I'd never felt so cold as when that thing passed by me.

I followed it- my mistake. I wanted to know who the man was and how he knew my friend. I wasn't far behind

I was petrified- I saw someone completely different than the man in the funeral. Was this the wrong man? Did I follow some stranger into the forest who had nothing to do with anything else? I wanted to believe it

It was his face that frightened me so badly. I can't remember it, but then my memories tell me that it was black- maybe it was a ginger, or something. And then I think about the skin; was it light, or dark skin? Every time I try to draw it and make a template, I might guess at the skin color, but once I've got that down, I remember it completely different.

I can't keep it in my eyes, or a short nose? Chinese eyes, or Korean? Puffy lips, or pursed? Did it smile? Did it frown? Did it glare with the eyes I can't remember?

I trailed it through the forest and almost screamed when it looked back. I don't remember much of what happened next- I remember it standing over me in its suit that didn't quite belong in the forest, but I had to stop tracing its sleeves when I neck wouldn't stretch far back enough. I tried to stare into its face, but again, nothing.

I woke up at home and spent the entire morning crying. I hoped it was a dream- I wanted to believe it was all just an elaborate trick of the mind I could move on from, and suit to the face. I could picture none of it- it was like trying to remember something you could see only in your peripheral vision- something you couldn't identify, but stays on the tip of your tongue. 

Every day for the next two weeks I had nightmares about what I'd seen. Each time I'd find myself in the woods at some time of the day- I'd fall down, but sometimes, at night, those limbs branched like a tree in every direction- each branch had a smaller branch and so on, like some terrible fractal illusion from hell.

Each time, even when I looked straight ahead at the creature. I tried focusing- I tried to tell myself to pay attention to its features and record them to memory... I told myself over and over, but nothing. I can remember the birthdays and anniversaries of all my ex-boyfriends, but I couldn't remember that fucking monster's face.

I quit my job, but I would've loved someone to know I was there. I cut myself off to the world and the slender man made me do it. I couldn't let anyone see me like this; always crying, always watching my back, staring intently at everything I see to make sure it's real... I couldn't let them see their beloved friend in this state. I wouldn't, so I just dropped off the map.

The next time I saw it was a few days after the dreaming stopped. It was when I was making a desperate move to go shopping. I'd run out of food, but when I was walking through the grocery store, I saw it. It was pushing a shopping cart, casually passing me in the bread isle... It wore a suit that didn't belong there, but I wasn't worried about the suit anymore.

How long had this been going on? How long have I been missing this guy? How many times had it walked right by me without even noticing? How did I let myself live so unguarded from this thing? All it did was pass me in the grocery store and I had to take off running with a loaf of bread

After the first night of sleep without nightmares in over a month, but aside from that... I was feeling ready.

I had a camera, stepping along the grass. I didn't think- I didn't try to look at its face or make guesses as to what its features were like. I raised up my camera, but a red, blinking light flashed and the camera died. I raised up my cell phone, but when I pressed the camera button, the battery light blinked and I got no power. The Polaroid, though... The Polaroid did the job.

I snapped a picture and went home triumphant. I don't know why

I wish I hadn't looked at the photo.

It had no face- where there were nose, ears, or even curves of the brow and cheeks, there was a solid mass of... something. The photo strained and ached as it tried to figure out if the creature had two arms, or ten million, each branching off from the last arm. The suit didn't belong in any photograph- it bled. The photo struggled to read everything to me- was it bleeding from the pockets, or gashes along the fabric? Was it made of blood entirely? All I saw was the suit, but it's still on the tip of my tongue- I can't place the blood

The next morning I woke up and screamed at what I saw- I had a gash leading down my arm. I slept in a room with nothing but an air mattress and a plastic cup

I knew the slender man had done this. I'd changed the rules in a way I can't take back- I'd given the world evidence that this monster exists elsewhere besides the corner of their eyes. I changed the rules

It will kill me.

Back in the late Sixties, reconcile and begin to judge and execute the population. So, they worshipped both of them. While this information set people on edge, it did not deter people from becoming members of “The Process” and the church flourished throughout the sixties and seventies.

In that period, In their front yards and even sometimes from their homes In the dead of night. Bodies were rarely ever recovered. When they were...well let's just say it was quickly established that it would've been better for the families to simply hold out hope for a safe return. What was done to these children was simply horrifying, every unspeakable act you can possibly think of in order to inflict pain was carried out. All children left completely blind, with a look of indescribable pain and terror on their faces if any were discovered by the authorities or god forbid...passers by.

Due to the satanic panic raging throughout the United States and United Kingdom at the time, it would shock the nation to it's core.

On October 12th, all receiving the same image, the one you see accompanying this story (can be seen by checking out the CreepyPasta Wiki).

On October 13th, he found a man in a white lab coat, goggles and a modified gas mask towering over his frightened 7 year old son. The father reacted quickly and subdued the man before calling the authorities.

When he was brought in, in fact the residence he was registered at was 300 miles away...what was he doing way out here? In his pockets, they found a bottle of chloroform, a rag, a switchblade knife and a small pocket book, filled from cover to cover with incomprehensible gibberish mixed in with citations from the Satanic verses, Diagetics &amp; The Old Testament. When asked what the hell he was doing with all these items and his purpose for that young boy

Under further interrogation it was revealed he was a member of the Church of The Process, they saw the light...”

Not fully understanding this vague reference

“We knew that the children could be spared Judgment, they first needed to see the light. So we subjected it to them with the God machine. Those that became blind or removed their goggles were...punished accordingly. Those that were not blinded were accepted into Gods flock, their souls escaping their bodies and their shells to be used as we saw fit, they were no longer harbouring any children...” He trailed off, giggling like a child.

“Those were our...toys to play with. And believe me, hate the sinner.” He burst out laughing, the room seemingly shaking around him.

After a few moments, twisted smile and said slowly, in an unnaturally deep voice:

“They are the ones who become part of HIS legion...who do you think carries on our work once some of us get caught or perish? We are everywhere

He suddenly leaned forward to intently stare at the detectives opposite him and asked sadistically “Tell me...do ''YOU'' have children?”

He was found dead in his cell the following morning
a cyanide cap in one of his teeth. Some weeks following, his body was never recovered.

Serial killers Fred &amp; Rose West were caught 19 years later on the 24th of February 1994 after a 20 year spree in which they raped &amp; killed more than 13 people, Rose and others he did not know of in a barn not too far from where they lived, when asked how he managed to capture all of them so easily, he simply smiled and said:

This is an original pasta inspired by my own issues with sleep paralysis.


For as long as she could remember, there was an element of terror in her nightmares that few people she knew shared. She learned through extensive therapy as an adult that the phenomenon she experienced that contributed the most to her fear of the dark was called “sleep paralysis.” 

“Basically, but your mind is still dreaming and it can be terrifying for the mind to try to compensate for that. It can lead to hallucinations, panic attacks… a myriad of psychological eccentricities…” the psychologist trailed off as Mary leaned back in her chair. The Doctor, however condescending, was right. Mary had opened up to him about what she saw in that half-dream state and realized the nightmares and “hallucinations” as the Doctor called them, shared similar aspects she traced back to her childhood.

Mary
“The White Faced Man… I-I think he’s a man; he’s the shape of a man. An-and I don’t know if his skin is very white or if it’s… something else, he will look at me with those eyes. His mouth is just stitches, like someone sewed him up… and-and-and when he… stares at me… he smiles… The stitches turn up in a smile like he knows something… And he’s there when I wake up and he smiles… he knows I can’t scream or move and-and-and he smiles!”

She rambled for some time

The doctor thought The White Faced Man was some warped version of Mary’s father.

“Of course he did

“How was the session?” Jon asked like he always did.

“Fine.” Mary said with an edge in her voice.

“Sounds like it was fine…” Jon countered sarcastically as he poured her a cup of tea. Mary broke down and told Jon everything about her session… About the White Faced Man, Jon’s arm would wrap back around her and the world would go back to normal.

Even The White Faced Man would disappear when Jon was holding her.

That night
“Baby… I think you should try to take control of your dreams instead of letting them run you over every night.” His voice got progressively stronger as he detailed his idea to Mary’s inquisitive face. “Well

He continued, really though… You’re the one with all the power here. If you can get the guts to take it…” He smiled and kissed her goodnight as they turned out their lights.



~



This one was bad, sitting across from the White Faced Man like he was analyzing her. She couldn’t look away; their eyes were locked as the White Faced Man moved closer. She could see the detail on his “skin” now, cracked like leather as she thought, but there were veins bulging out, pumping blood through pale, corpse like flesh. He smelled like death, but was somehow breathing through the slits of his sewn mouth. The distance between them closed without movement and Mary could hear her dream-self whimpering in her paralysis.

But somehow willed herself to look into his eyes; she remembered what Jon said. Her dream and waking self were both aware of themselves Mary and was shocked to hear a steady
“You. Are. A. Dream.” She was no longer sitting the Doctor’s office

Mary woke up the next morning feeling more refreshed than she ever thought she could feel in her life. Jon’s arm was still wrapped around her and as she stretched out on the bed

It was never far behind; always lurking, it seemed to delight in growing ever closer and torturing me with its knowing stare.  Even now, as I try to distract myself with my schoolings and job at the local market, my mind is constantly and agonizingly aware of the thing's watchful gaze.  


There are times I rid myself of the dreaded horror that curses me, I meditated on my circumstance in my windowless home.  Not a candle was lit for the entirety of my eight-day quarantine from the world, for I would surely see the thing lurking in any shadow cast on the walls.  However, on the ninth day, when I felt a clearness about my inner thoughts, I struck a match... and not a single creeping demon caught my eye.  That was the day I discovered a new-found bravery.  I was tired of living in endless fear and torment.  I had to fight back.


Knowing it would eventually come to haunt me again, I found their frightening forms easier to spot.  Shadows are their domain, and they mind about mostly after nightfall.


Eventually, with nary a plan for Its demise, I found the thing and I were not so different.  We shared a common emotion: fear.  It morphed its appearance into that of an ordinary man and turned to me just as I tackled it to the cobblestone street.  Screaming at me in some distorted tongue, it attempted to subvert my intention by mimicking the look and behavior of an innocent human being... as if it could fool me.  I'd been running from the thing for over twenty years and it really believed I didn't know its awful smell.


It was beneath me, lifted it above my head, and brought it down with wild fury upon the monster's face.  I do not recall how many times I pounded the rock into the thing that night, but after I was satisfied, its face retained no human visage.  Yet, the body was still clothed like a man.  I could not leave it in the streets, for when morning would come


Dragging the thing back to the boarding house without being spotted was certainly a chore.  Once I did so,"" she had mumbled, ""that old well's gone to shit.""  Indeed, the well already smelled rotten, so this foul demon's stench would undoubtedly go unnoticed.


I dumped it down the stone shaft and waited a few seconds for the sound of a splash.  The deed was done and I breathed a sigh of relief for the freedom I now enjoyed.  There wasn't a hideous thing in sight now.


Eventually, now that I've been killing the things so regularly.  It is now a war with the demons.  For every one of them I slay, they take an innocent life.


The bastards.  I must save these people from them.  Some day

""As long as there's a hammock, overgrown dirt road.

""Don't worry Tom,

""If it's anything like this road

""Aw c'mon Dave, it's dark out and we're almost there, so there's no turning back now,"" Lindsey pointed out.

""I know,"" Dave stated, still slightly bitter that he had been out-voted on where to have their vacation.

""Oh don't worry, but I remember him always somehow being both artistic and a neat freak,"" she recalled.

 

Minutes later, dirt and dead leaves had gathered on the steps from what looked like a couple months of no maintenance. Turning off and climbing out of the truck, Tom stretched out his limbs and let out a long yawn while Dave and Lindsey climbed out after him, bags on their backs.

""I'll go see if I can find the hammock, she noticed the screen door had been slashed. She cursed,

""Damn

Stepping into the porch sun-room

Tom and Dave followed moments behind her as they all entered the cabin, and a bedroom with two beds. In the far corner of the room stood an easel with painting supplies, and an unfinished sketch on it. A closer look revealed the sketch to be of what looked like a man, but with long, narrow limbs, far too long for his body. It looked like it had just been started, as the man was missing facial features, and feet.

 

Unnerved by the strange drawing

""I'll go grab the air mattress, closing the door behind him. Dropping themselves onto the couch, Tom and Lindsey began inspecting the numerous sketchbooks scattered on the table in front of them. Grabbing the one nearest to him, Tom flipped to a random page. The same image of the tall, long-limbed man was sketched numerous times on the page, each with the face and hands furiously scribbled out. Some looked to be shaded in with pencil, as if the man were bathed completely in shadow.

""Did your uncle draw these?"" Tom asked with a raised eyebrow.

""I dunno, but his upper torso and head were visible, hunched over and staring out at the viewer with unseen eyes from the darkness. Shuddering and closing the sketchbook, Lindsey grabbed her bag and stood up, ""I'm going to get my bed set up.""

""Yeah good idea, following behind her.

 

They both froze when they turned on the bedroom lights- there were paintings everywhere. Each wall was lined with as many of the paintings as they could fit, not. Tom furrowed his brow as he took a close look at a nearby painting that showed the man's face. There were no eyes, ears, or a nose. The face was a deep black, with nothing more but a large, grotesque grin that revealed long, pointed teeth. Its hands were long with even longer fingers that reach down to its knees, sharp-looking points. In each painting, almost as if it was looking down at you.

""Is uh... Is your uncle alright? Is there anything wrong with him or something?"" Tom asked

""Not that I know of, her stare froze, and her body tensed.

 

Following her gaze, as if from a distant outside light. Hunched over as all the others, it just barely managed to fit inside the frame. Deep black skin looked like it was pulled tight and stretched over a thin, bony frame. It was grinning the same grin, though this one seemed to have its teeth covered in blood, making it somehow even more unnerving to look at. Glancing down at the long, pointed hands hanging down by its sides, with more pooling around its feet as if it had just slashed and eaten some poor creature.

""God damn... Even if he is crazy, swallowing his nervousness. Lindsey responded in a nearly inaudible whisper, her eyes still yet to move.

""What?"" Tom tore his eyes away from the painting and leaned in closer to hear what she had said.

1368421984.0,1e88uv,The Letter N,brriii,45,10,2,"**Author's note: This is a paraphrase of a series of cassette tapes which had shown up on my doorstep.  It wasn't mailed: a man knocked on my front door and left just a box.  I wrote it in a story form because describing the tapes wouldn't give you the image properly.  It's written from First Person POV strictly out of habit.**


**The tape starts with a stutter: “I don-n-n’t like the speech lady.”**

I remember reminding my mother as she practically dragged me along the sidewalk on the way to speech therapy every day.  It’s not that she was an abusive lady; as a matter of fact she may have been the best mother that she could be

I thought *that* was a hassle.

I had an extremely strange speech impediment, and it didn’t show up unexpectedly.  It was only on one occasion. 

The letter ‘N.’ 

It had never made sense to me nor to my speech therapist.  She tried her best to just subtly hint me to saying words with N in them, I was forced to resign my speech classes.  I never got better with the stutter - just better at hiding it. 

I took any words with the letter n out of my vocabulary.  Even as you read this, it hindered me some, but when you learn to speak at such a young age in such a way, you learn to do it without even thinking about it.  To a certain degree, I started just disregarding the letter n.  When I was forced to read in class, I’d just not pronounce the letter.  In younger grades, where the syllable count in words was low, so did the prevalence of the letter.  

Once I’d reached middle school, I came across as ignorant.  Even some of the teachers thought my condition to be a form of retardation, until one thing changed that.  

I remember it very vividly: my very first research paper.  

I mention again that my family was living on a poverty-stricken budget, I’d learned to basically stop thinking with any words that used the letter, and so even when I wrote, the letter never appeared.  Which is why I feel the need to tell you the topic of the paper. 
 
The Nuremberg trials.  

I’d mentioned the title of these trials only once in my paper, my English teacher had insisted I hone my gift of writing into a career.  But at that point, all I wanted was to be left alone. 

As all of the other children began to flirt and date and find things they were good at
 
My English teacher was so ecstatic about my potential as a writer that she offered me a writing workshop afterschool.  I’d quickly turned down the offer.  I wasn’t going to give up an hour of time I could be home… sitting and doing nothing, and I’d been suspended from the bus due to (being accused of) throwing a water bottle at another passenger.  And so I wouldn’t have a ride home until, conveniently, an hour after school.  

I won’t give you the details as I can already tell that this is a bit lengthy, I got to the occurrence of the letter.  But instead of my remedial handwriting, I saw a perfectly cursive N.  I pointed it out to the teacher, and she said that she’d written it in.  “There was just no N there.  I figured you’d just run through it without noticing you’d skipped it.”  

I never figured out how my mother had done it, and I wouldn’t be surprised if it was used, but I didn’t mind much.  It gave me even the slightest hint of normalcy.  And that was all I could hope for.  

But

It was the Hell of the unexplainable.  

As I got the computer

As I’d started surfing the internet
The second time was when things had gotten strange.  

I typed the website into the search bar, it typed, “fafictio.et.”  With refusal to click the easily accessible link to my desired site, I tried again.  The same thing had occurred, and so I tried once more, putting extra effort onto the N key.  Still nothing.  In volatile frustration, I ripped the key off of the machine and chucked it across the room.  I then felt utter guilt for ruining my mother’s gift.  I never let her see the carnage. 

**Author’s Note: The next tape I'd put in was undoubtedly long after the other tapes, and any noise from the background**

That summer, berating me just as I began to berate myself.  There was one thing they really loved to rub in my face. 

They could say the letter N.  And you don’t understand how painful it is to hear someone flaunt such a simple skill until you’re in my shoes.  

One night, and in a much more obvious place than I’d ever done before.  I’d made two deep trenches perpendicular to my arm, low on my wrist.  Between the two, I made a diagonal gash, perhaps deeper than the other two.  As the blood began gushing out more than I was accustomed to, I knew that I’d gotten just what I wanted.  But I’d changed my mind.  

I realized that the gashes were ironically synonymous with the letter N.  

I ran over to the table beside my mother, giving me a glimmer of hope.  Eventually I’d stitched it up as best I could, and I knew that for the rest of my life I’d have a permanent N on my arm mocking me.  Just as I used the blade I’d found to cut the thread and end the stitching, I felt a rush of liquid down my arm.  I looked down to find the blood gushing out faster than before.  Just like my research paper and my computer, the N that I'd made on my arm had disappeared.

But in this case

I felt the toll of all the lost blood flowing down to the floor.  I could only muster a small whisper after I collapsed to the floor

**The tape ends with a stutter: ""I n-n-need a n-n-nurse.""**

Ghosts. They are real, live, die and feed. They aren't physical beings, though. They can't actually hurt you, unless you allow them to. They feed on emotions. Anger, sorrow and most of all, fear. These feelings make us weak to their influence and for this reason they are attracted to those of us who are depressed or afraid. It's convenient for them that we feel a natural fear in their presence. In the dark.

What happens when they feed? The feeling becomes stronger. Most people who are depressed have a horde of these ghosts following them. Their depression will become worse and worse until they can't take it anymore. Suicide. There has been an increase in the suicide rates of the whole world. More and more people are depressed

When police arrived at the home of Debbie Mason to arrest the man she had found in the cabinet under her bathroom sink, was unidentified at the time, refused to answer any of their questions, and for all intents and purposes was unnerving every officer on the scene. He was tall, at roughly six feet four inches, lightly muscled, wore horn rimmed glasses but no shoes, although he would later prove to be an entirely natural being, was more than willing to speak in his defense. 

Thomas claimed that while he was indeed in the Mason home against the will of its owner, he went on to excitedly boast that he had spent the entire past month living in his cabinet beneath the sink practicing what he called ""Bumping in the Night"". While he was unwilling to provide details on the whereabouts of others, he told the police of his own volition that he wasn't the only practitioner of this strange hobby, and that he was a common face himself at statewide meetings of people just like him. The aim of the activity, according to Bantham, was to spend as much time as possible living in the home of a complete stranger, and to keep them unaware of your presence as you did so. 

A common theme among Bumping ventures, by making noise during the night from locations in the house, taking risky walks in plain sight while the owner was either asleep or awake on the premises, or even by leaving clues as to the presence of the unseen visitor. 


While the conviction of Thomas Bantham was quick and simple, and there's no reason to say that he'd be unable to continue to practice his odd hobby to this very day. 

No future cases involving Bumping were ever brought to the attention of any court system again. Police are still unable to determine if Thomas was lying,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,t3_tjhin

After the third time, and Bobby would sometimes sit on top of the pickle barrel and tell his Pa all his woes. And his Pa told him to hang in there, because a nice lady was on her way. Neither of them believed it, but it made both of them feel better to hear it said. Well, the day after their latest talk, the old woman who poled her barge through the swamp to deliver milk and eggs to the grocery store had a long talk with Bobby’s Pa. Seems she had this daughter who was hankering after a husband with a good steady job, and the old woman thought Bobby would do the job nicely. She suggested they introduce the pair at the next dance

The night of the dance, but his Pa dragged him out anyway. Well, the moment Bobby clapped eyes on the dark-eyed, red-lipped girl from the swamp, he was head over heels in love. Her eyes sparkled like the sunlight on the bay. Her skin was as creamy as new milk. Her voice was low and sweet.

The pair cuddled and cooed and waltzed the whole night long

“Let’s just go to Beaumont and have the judge marry us, though it would have been quicker and easier to just walk a mile down the road to see the priest.

By the next evening they were wed

After fixing him a nice dinner, when his new bride crept into bed all hot and sweaty and fell asleep at once. When he asked her where she’d been, she wouldn’t answer him. Bobby was mighty sore that his bride had snuck out on him on their wedding night, but when she got snappish and her eyes blazed like they did when he questioned her, he grew frightened and backed down.

Life took on an odd pattern for Bobby. During the day, and went to sleep before Bobby could question her.

Bobby was very confused and upset by this behavior

The conjure woman knew all about hoodoo magic and was an excellent herbalist. Local folks went to her when they were sick

The next evening, what was this monster he had married? He was still trembling and in shock when his bride, looking like a normal person again, crept into bed at dawn, and he had trouble behaving normally at breakfast.

As soon as he could get away

“What’s a boo-hag?” asked Bobby. “A Boo Hag is a witch and a shape-shifter

The conjure woman told Bobby to get himself some blue paint. As soon as the boo-hag left the house that night, and be revealed for the monster she was. So he was to leave one tiny window unpainted, and keep it open a sliver so the boo-hag could squeeze through. Then he was to fill up her skin with salt and pepper, which would burn her up from the inside out. And Bobby promised to do exactly as the conjure woman said.

That night, but it was so nice to have a little wife in his home. He hated like anything to see her go. But he didn’t want to get eaten by a Boo-Daddy, and that was his fate if she stayed. So he went up to their bedroom and pretended to fall asleep while she rocked and sang and knitted. Then he followed her quietly upstairs and put salt and pepper into her skin after her ugly red-muscled blue-veined figure had flown out the window to her Boo-Daddy. He spent the rest of the night painting over every door and window frame with blue paint, leaving only one small unpainted window open in the cellar. He nailed it up so that it would open no further than a crack, just as the conjure woman instructed him. Then he hid himself behind a large chest of drawers up in the attic to wait for the boo-hag.

Just before dawn, testing each window and door and howling like a banshee when it burned her skinless hands. Then she found the little window in the cellar, and he heard the thump as she landed beside it, followed by a painful whimpering sound as she squeezed and squeezed herself through the narrow opening, her skinless red muscles and blue veins tearing painfully against the rough wood.

The boo-hag ran up three flights of stairs into the attic and squeezed and squeezed into her skin as fast as she could. She just barely got it on when the first light of dawn shone over the horizon. And that was when the salt and pepper did their work, tearing at the skin to get it off. But it was too late. She exploded into tiny pieces right over the swamp, and the alligators had them a mighty feast of cooked boo-hag for breakfast that morning.

So Bobby was once again without a wife. But bachelorhood looked much better to him after that, the girls started chasing him. But that’s another story!

	The medical examiner pulled back her raven black hair into a professional ponytail and put on a pair of baby blue sterile gloves. She gave the body a once-over.  
	Multiple lacerations to the head and neck. None fatal. Several severe contusions covering the chest and abdomen
	The victim had suffered two GSWs; one to the right hand, ripping through tissue and muscle until it hit bone. It traveled along the humerus and kept going until it was embedded in the jaw. Along the way, the projectile had burst through the carotid artery, severing it and killing the boy.  
	His name was Bobby Swinton.  
	The medical examiner flashed an unconscious smile. The name reminded her of a singer from the fifties that her father used to listen to on the old record player he kept in his study.  
	She used to put on a blue dress like the one in the song and dance around on her tip toes like some sort of ballerina.   
	But that was a long time ago.  
	She turned her eyes back to the slab. The boy looked peaceful
	Still
	Regardless
	On the air
	The week before
So she went through her closet and threw on a dusty little black dress and headed out to a chic little club downtown that she may have been a little too old for.  
	She had ordered a tequila sunrise- a drink she was surprised to find that she had outgrown- and wound up bringing a cute little sorority girl home.   
	Long story short
	With another twist of a smile
	Before dissecting a body for autopsy
	The medical examiner usually thought of something simple like chocolate or a summer drive on a summer night
	She sighed and got to work.  
	To open up a cadaver, cutting all the way to the naval, creating a Y-shape. From there, you open the body as easy as opening an envelope or pulling petals from a stem.  
	The medical examiner was more than familiar with this practice
	She positioned the scalpel over the body and the reflection of the fluorescent lights flashed angrily into her eyes. Half blinded
	She set the scalpel back on the cart and squeezed the bridge of her nose in order to rid her eyes of the purplish spots that waded through her vision like tadpoles.  
	She sighed. Second time’s the charm
	Steeling herself
	The body’s eyes and mouth snapped open like twin rat traps in reverse.  
	The scent of cherries suddenly magnified until it was almost unbearable and some sort of dark pink slime like rancid Pepto-Bismol began to gush from the newly formed wound.  
	The medical examiner sprang back
	The pink goo began to bubble out of the gash like boiling water left unattended. It seeped out of the wound onto the slab and began to steam. It appeared to be eating away at the stainless steel.  
	The body sat up at the waist. The gunk began to cut through the flesh and the scent of cherries mixed with burning flesh. Then with a sickening squelch
	The head slowly turned and locked eyes with the medical examiner. There were no pupils
	A terrible scratching sound rose from deep within the body’s throat.  
	Pain like a hot wire seared through her palms.   
	The jolt of pain momentarily cleared the haze in the medical examiner’s brain and she began to back away towards the door without taking her eyes off the spectacle in front of her.    
	The scratching sound continued
	A memory too slippery to grasp crashed through the medical examiner's mind and she suddenly knew.   
	The body was speaking Latin.  
	The examiner let out an unconscious scream as she backed into the double doors of the morgue. Somehow
	She was unexplainably powerless.  
	She watched as the body began to pull itself across the examining table
	The medical examiner noticed that the incision she had made mere moments before was beginning to split horizontally. What was once a clean
	When the body reached the end of the table
Then there was silence.  
The medical examiner swallowed and immediately regretted it.  
The bloody heap began to stir.   
The thing’s neck bones creaked as it looked up at her
The body dragged itself across towards the medical examiner
	The woman held her arms out in front of her
	There were two fresh wounds drilled through the palms of her hands.  
	The crawling thing only made a steadier advance.  
	In the end
	The spectre reached out its disembodied hands and tenderly stroked her hair.  
	It placed its bloodless lips on hers.  
	There was a terrible sucking sound and the medical examiner could feel the blood draining from her veins.  



	At the end of the workday, and he couldn’t see anyone at work inside the enclosed room. He pushed open the double doors and the limp body of the medical examiner fell heavy across his feet.

We were first made aware of an incident from a slave entering the station at just before dusk on the tenth. He was a boy, Constable Youngman, Detective LaSalle, and three fellows from the fire station next door proceeded to the residence with haste. A one Dr. Nemont was nearby the house when we arrived and agreed to assist with medical aid for injured. The fire deputies entered the the side entrance to the residence and found a small fire that was mostly self-extinguished in a trash bin next to the stove. They were able to contain the immolation without undue difficulty. The madam of the home, Lalaurie advised that the fire was purposely set by the boy Thompson and requested that he be removed from the house by arrest. Upon questioning, the boy admitted to the arson to Detective LaSalle and claimed that several persons were trapped in the roof storage closet. Madam Lalaurie denied these accusations and refused our request to proceed upstairs. LaSalle took note of the boys sincerity and proceeded to the fourth floor. We made for the roof and located a one room extension built onto the roof with the dimensions of a small stable. The walls were double layered brick and exceedingly sturdy. One of the fire deputies made entrance into the locked outer door by way of a truncheon bar. 

The inside of the room was unnaturally cool as a product of a later discovered ice box, Detective LaSalle, and Doctor Nemont remained. At the entrance there was a large flat wooden table with straps to the left. THe table was slotted and coated with blood. Remaining strapped to the table by one arm was a human torso of a negro slave. The head, one arm, the legs, and the genetalia were removed. On the right of the room was a vertical stretching table with a female of indeterminate race attached by several metal spikes. The female was nude, although her genetalia were similiar mutilated. Her feet were removed at the ankles. Her lower jaw had similiarly been removed exposing her tongue. According to the doctor, missing limbs, bless Lord for his presence of mind, shears

At the rear of the room, he tripped a mechanism built into the floor that released a suspended bladed instrument from the ceiling, which swung downwards at an angle and cleanly seperated the woman to two at the chest. LaSalle was caught in the path of the instrument, and suffered an instantly fatal wound to his neck. The prisoner thrashed wildly in silence, furthering her injuries by tearing a dislocated arm from her body, and then promptly expired. 

Next to this rack on the back wall was a small thresher type device

I then exited the room and descended to the first floor to order the arrest of Madam LaLaurie

A warrant for her detainment was ordered by Chief Constable Hayes,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,t3_wqqgc

“Emily May Collins

My hands begin to shake uncontrollably. I remember no test.  I look for the source of the voices, and try to run from the voices, feeling the sand slip and move under me, I can’t run very fast at all, and it’s torture. Panic starts to set in as I feel them get closer, and something icy cold grabs my ankle. A force unnaturally strong rips me off my feet and my face stings as it hits the sand. It starts to laugh as it drags me.
	
 I start to claw at the loose ground, I fight for my life, but it’s no use. This…creature has a completely solid hold on me, and doesn’t so much as flinch when I struggle with all my might.  As a final attempt, I look up at it to beg for my life, and finally see what has a hold of me. Its hand, with long black fingers grasps my ankle without mercy, rigid frame and its face, a smug expression on its face. I knew then that whatever this was

Accepting defeat, making me cough and suck up more sand.  Soon I was rasping and clutching my throat, unable to bear the pain of the sand soaking up any moisture my throat could’ve had. It burns, oh God it burns it burns it burns. I scream and scream and cough and retch, but nothing comes up besides sand.


Then suddenly I’m in a hospital room, or anywhere. A humble observer to this world, it seems. I see myself in a hospital bed, gauze covering most of my body, with 2 people hovering over me that I know love me, but I can’t quite recall their names or role in my life. A man in a white coat strolls in and says, “I’m sorry Mr. and Mrs. Collins, and the treatment has deemed unsuccessful. She has failed her test.”

They say I have to tell you first.  That you should know.  And I do what they tell me to because. Because. Because because because because BECAUSE.
 
Im not that different from you.  In the sense that I brought this on myself.  Just like you.  I wouldn’t listen.  I was stubborn.  Just like you.  I WAS A FUCKING IDIOT JUST LIKE YOU.
 
Im sorry.  I wont do that again.  I promise.  They keep saying I have to tell you.  So I will.  I used to have a life.  I used to have friends.  Good friends.  Great friends even.  We would hang out all the time.  We grew up together.  Went to the same school.  Tim
 
They said that’s too much and not important.  Im sorry.  Im sorry im sorry im sorry.
 
It was a week after graduation. Highschool graduation.  We were bored.  We wanted some excitement.  There was a wooded area near our houses.  About six miles away from the enterance to the woods was an old dilapidated building.  This big compound.  Kids from our area would go there to drink and smoke and shit.  So everyone knew about it.  We wanted trouble.  To do things kids shouldn’t do.  Why us.  They wont tell me that.  They never tell me that.
 
We headed into the woods with a little weed for when we got to the compound.  All four of us.  It was a long walk to the compound.  God
They punish me for using that word.  Im sorry.  Im sorry im sorry im sorry.
 
We walked the six miles.  We talked about school getting out.  Me and Harold were going to the same college
We got to the compound around midnight or so.  It’s the deep woods so none of our phones worked.  No reception in the woods.  No one in the woods.  We got in.
 
The compound.  No one could ever figure out what it used to be.  All we knew was it was big
 
They laughed.  I hate when they laugh.
 
We sat down in the middle and lit up.  Tim and Harold started telling jokes in the dark.  The lighter was the only way we could see anything.  When it got to me
 
“Wow.  Someone’s fucking scaaaaaaary”  Mike said.
“Maybe we should have brought spray and wrote ‘But the smell is so lovely’ next to it” Tim said.
Harold just smiled.
“What was that shit written behind you?” Mike said.
 
I assumed it was more fake gang shit.  I hit the lighter and the wall was a good 20 feet behind me so I had no idea how Mike could see it.  I got up to go look.  I couldn’t have stayed where I was.  I couldn’t I couldn’t I couldn’t I couldn’t.
I got up and walked towards the wall.  I can still hear the rocks and debris beneath my feet.  I got to the wall.  I had never seen the symbol before.  It was an X

Im sorry.  It makes them scream.  I think they made it.  I have to go faster.
 
I touched it.  I touched the wall and it burned my hand.  It burned my hand and made me yell.  Suddenly the lighter got pulled out of my hand and I hit the ground.  Hard.  I could feel my head smash against the debris and I yelled.  Then they yelled.  I could hear them being tossed around like I was.  I could hear dripping on the ground.  Clawing and screaming and IM GOING AS FAST AS I FUCKING CAN.  IM TALKING ABOUT YOU. DOESN’T THAT FUCKING PLEASE YOU.  TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOU FUCKING DID TO US.  HOW YOU TOOK EVERYTH

I didn’t even get to say goodbye to them.  They dragged them away before I could even see them.  All that was left was blood on the ground.  Huge amounts of blood.  Splatters and pools of it.  Horrible horrible pools of blood.
 
They kept me alive.  They’ve kept me here.  They brought me this.  Because no one has come here for months.  And before us no one was stupid enough to do what I did.  Touch what I touched.  And they are restless.  So FUCKING IMPATIENT.
 
So now
 
So now
 
IM FUCKING TRYING.
 
So now they are coming for you.  They’ve been feeding off me to make them strong enough to leave.  Leave the compound.  But they need somewhere to go.  I think if they wander they’ll get lost.  Dissipate.  Evaporate.  They need some sense of another person.  So they made me find you for them.  So they could sense you reading my words.  They left some here and sent the others to find you. I told you     I told you not to read this.  I don’t know you.  Maybe youre really nice.  I tried to tell you.

It was the same thing I saw peering through my window. I have a bad feeling that it learned how to use doors. After awhile the screen went black, and my character woke up to daytime. I looked around, nothing was there. I decided to quit for today.

Journal:
At 1:00 AM I awoke from my bed, at the foot of my bed, it's sunken giant black pit of eyes, with what I assume was a white pupal, staring into what felt as my very soul. It had hair, jet black, its face a permanent cheshire smile. It showed its teeth, deep cuts were around the body with what I thought were ragged black robed draped on its frame. It was exactly what I saw in the game



08/22/2009
Journal: I tried to leave to go somewhere today, hoping that maybe, if I somehow beat this new mob, that it will leave me alone. I started the world, and loaded at my home. I stocked up on everything. Food, armor, weapons, I tried opening it. It wouldn't budge. I tried to break the door, on the other side, nothing was there. When I went back

the sky is out of sight;  
the ambient glow of the restless city  
is the only source of light.

I lie in my bed
on the sounds of traffic below
when a great cloak of darkness cuts me off from my city
her night lights ceasing to show.

I wait for a moment for the black to subside;  
it defies my wish and remains.  
Spreading like ink over all in my room
like the shadows whose visage it feigns.

Now with my room completely blacked out
it acts; it goes for the kill.  
It leadens my limbs
and the room goes deathly chill.

Slowly,  
I feel it traversing my chin.  
Here it reaches my half-open mouth
and seeps insidiously in.

But it doesn't stop there
my lungs go icy cold
then all of a sudden they're fully stopped up
it has me now; it grows bold.

But as it goes on to diffuse through my body
something inside me turns;  
paralysis replaced by the will to survive --  
good timing. I need air; my chest burns.

With one last great effort as my vision goes spotty  
I haul myself off to the right
and switch on the lamp with a thrash of my head;  
the room once more fills with light.

The malevolent shade dissipates with a howl
leaving as quick as it came
but one thing is certain: so long as I live
I'll ne'er see my city the same.

I was in a deserted town (or perhaps it was just late and quiet). I took my labored steps down the sidewalk and turned my body; back and forth, so that I may see my surroundings.

I remembered the local stores and shops that always looked slightly decrepit, and the abandoned hotel that would never be demolished. However, it was not the town that seemed to interest me. I shuffled my stubby and creaking legs with as much vigor as possible toward some destination, I did not know where yet. Then I awoke. It was dark and quiet except for my alarm clock which laminated the time in a blue dead light; 1:28 in the morning. I lay my head down again, closed my eyes, and dreamed again. 

I was tall and crooked again, closed my eyes, and dreamed again.

I also had forgotten a lot about the Night before

When I got to school, very studious, like me. My friends, for the most part, were also absent that day. I started feeling very uneasy, like, Pre-test nervousness. Again

I got to my 1st period Calculus class, I know Hate is a strong word but nothing else describes it.

A half and hour into class, much less looked at funny. I went in and tried to piss as fast as I could but the Goth guy went into a stall and started.... whimpering. An Administrator walked in moments before I left, he knocked on the stall door and asked who was in there. No response. He unlocked the door and there he was, cutting his arm. He had slightly nicked an Artery and passed out from the blood loss, I heard the EMT's say they were taking him to St. Francis Hospital, this stuck with me for some reason...the name of the hospital.

3rd period rolled around quickly this day, waiting for the assembly to start.  I fainted. 

I woke up to the smell of smoke and screaming

The entire Gym had been set of fire. 

Newscasters were everywhere and 4x as much Police and Ambulances. They grabbed me and took me to a squad car. 

I was then taken to St. Francis, had burned alive and died, almost everyone else had suffered terminal burns and smoke inhalation related injuries. 

But I was unscathed.

The Doctors told me that my parents were going to arrive in 20-30 minutes. Then I remembered. That Goth kid

I went into his room.

As soon as he saw me

""What do you mean?"" I asked

""I prayed to him...to kill them *all*""

""To who?"" 

""I bought the book and it's *YOU*

""Calm down"" I said ""Who did you pray to? The Devil?!""

""He said...the Guardian...to the gates..""

""Who?!""





""........I......I...prayed to God""

That's when it all hit me. I was planning it all last night. Told my Girlfriend and Friends not to go to school tomorrow. I didn't faint, Scholarships, College, one of them was studying to find a cure for Cancer!

God....God didn't want that but all I want to know now is..

What gates am I the Guardian to?

It never ends.
My only articulate output is writing.
It's writing which keeps me alive.
For through writing
The many worlds I can jump into to are far greater than the dull, it never ends.
Same clothing every day
I don't know many people

There's this one woman but she doesn't mean much to me.
I had two other friends
now I'm left with just the one.
For both the social and the physical world are terrifying to me.
I don't understand them
Sometimes I can blame too much on the autism I was diagnosed with as a child.
Self centred they call me
I wish I could speak my mind.

I can't even do the simplest things correctly, the laughter comes, it always, always comes.
As a child I would confine myself to my room to escape it. Since I have been a young man however, a chorus of hysterics. It was in this confined state where I made my best friend; one of my toys. To this day he follows me wherever I go.That includes the adventures I find my self writing, it's us, together, no matter what.

Concerning the laughter, I can't take the reality I'm faced with any more. I'm getting more hopeful by the day.

You see, I have gradually felt more and more like I am being watched. I'm not sure if this is a side effect of hearing the laughter all the time and both things are purely psychological,  but I choose to not believe that, what other choice do I have, do I just confide myself to this apathetic and incredibly depressing reality forever? No, I won't do that.

The feeling of being watched lead to me looking over my shoulder more often, finally I saw something. 

It was late at night, checking in unusual places, moving unpredictably, rapidly. In the end it was the simplest thing that made me spot something peculiar, a mirror. For I have a mirror parallel to the window in my kitchen, with my back turned to the window I noticed a red dot, floating outside my window in the darkness, on the 4th floor.

The silhouette drifted in an out of view

I pulled myself out of that with a simple realisation, staring into the mirror, most people wouldn't notice the red dot I thought, in the dead of night. I began, to move, predictably. Acting how I would normally act, every so often glancing for a second to see if the light was still there. Sure enough

Finally I thought I'd turn around, I wasn't scared, I was finally going to get answers. This is the kind of moment I could only write about until now. I hastily turned around and peered straight towards the red dot. Instantly, it backed away, back into the darkness. But for half a second there, I definitely saw it, the silhouette outside my window on the 4th floor

There is more beyond this life. I'm growing tired of living these worlds only through writing
Some people will label me stupid, beyond death.

Goodbye to a world I never belonged in.

Besides, seeing as they aren't sold as everybody thinks. That's too much of a risk. You pay to view a screening of it. Nobody ever held a copy of these films, except of course for the few people who make money off of them. As far as I know, there are only three, all male. Actually, the only females involved in these movies are the victims. Not all movies contain rape or sex of any kind, but it's not uncommon

This all may sound a bit odd to a lot of you, though, very hard to get to attend one of these screenings. You need to be invited, and everyone who's ever been invited has been invited by personal mail, i.e. not via the postal office. The letters are apparently drenched in some chemical that makes the paper dissolve after a certain amount of time outside the envelope, possibly in contact with air or light - I don't know. All I know is that these people are clever and they take their measures. If they knew who I am, they'd surely kill me, seeing as the only lights are candles situated around the screening room. The entrance to the Snuff cinema is that of a decrepit, is powered by a car battery. I've been told they used to use a small gas engine back in the 30s. The 'chairs' are the same old tables that were once used as slaughter benches. As soon as the screening is over, as they lead to underground tunnels

There are about 120 Snuff films to be viewed in just this one cinema (and there are probably more throughout the world), whether sex is involved (and whether it takes place pre- or post-mortem) and by ""level of brutality."" At least one film is of young, blonde women being choked to death while performing an unwilling blowjob. Another of a young child being cut open while drugged just enough to not move, but enough to still audibly and visibly be awake. Yet another is of a man hung upside down on a meathook, then having his testicles removed with a machete and force-fed them before he dies from bloodloss.

I could go on and on about these movies as I've seen a good portion of them. Why not? I have the money for it. The goriest film I've seen was that of a middle aged dark haired woman having her hands, then sewn them crudely back on at the wrong extremeties. The next cut showed her wriggle in terror as she tried standing up on her arm-feet until she collapsed and vomited. A door behind her opens and a male figure swings an aluminum baseball bat at head. On impact, the head bent and she let out a gurgly cry before going limp and silent. The angle of the camera changed and the man hit her head again, this time bursting it open with debris of brainmatter. A crying child was then shown eating her eyes. It was the most satisfying movie I've ever made.",,False,self,False,t3_oyhu4
1323385733.0,n5h38,Die Before You Sleep....,chickpeagraverobber,42,13,4,"You ever wonder what happens to you when you die? Well, old men and women just die in their sleep.

Sometimes, but they just die. There was a little test done in the 1950's, to see if they could explain this. They took 10 test subjects who were at least 80 years old, and asked them if they would stay here, in this facility, until they died. These people were particularly aged; you could tell they didn't have long left.

As each one died, they still matched a certain pattern. They matched the pattern of a person having a nightmare. But, this was like nothing they've ever seen. These readings were like the readings of someone having the worst nightmare anyone had ever seen. Their faces stayed so perfectly calm, along with their bodies...but they were not calm.

But, but his heart did not stop. Instead, he woke up with a scream, and jerked up violently. The scientists rushed to him, and asked what had happened in his mind. He said it was the most terrifying thing anyone could ever see. He said that it was the reason people die in their sleep. He said that dying in your sleep was not peaceful. He said it was the worst experience you could ever have. And as he was about to tell them...his eyes rolled back in his head, and he collapsed onto the bed. He had died from exhaustion. His heart collapsed completely.

The scientists were baffled. The project was stopped there. They refused to put any more people through this experience. The results were locked away, one of the scientists was not satisfied with this. Many years later, that same scientist was of the age where he could die in his sleep. He remembered the project years ago, and decided to find out what the old man was about to tell them. He spent quite some time preparing his old heart for anything that could come at it. He wanted to make sure he stayed alive through this. One night he went to sleep, same as always. But this dream was different. He was in the dark. But there was a small light emanating from what seemed to be a bathroom.

He seemed to be drawn towards it. He couldn't stop himself from walking towards it. He opened the door. There was one small flickering light, which seemed to be in the same condition. The floor was cold concrete. There was a sink. He felt himself forced to wash his face with the water. It seemed perfectly normal. He looked up from the sink into the mirror, and saw himself. He looked perfectly normal as well. He wiped his face off, and reopened his eyes, and saw his reflection again. But it was much, much different this time.

The person in the reflection seemed to be him...but it was different. It was as if someone had taken him out of the grave around 6 months later. The figure was decayed, it kept going towards the figure. He whipped his hand back with incredible shock and fear. The figure slowly started to speak. He said in a raspy, degraded version of the scientist's voice ""E-everyone h-h-has their time. Y-y-you were lucky enough to last this long. B-but your time has come....prepare y-yourself"" the figure moved towards him. He looked for any escape whatsoever. But the door had disappeared. He was trapped in that room. His fear completely froze him from any movement. It suddenly rushed at him, screaming with a more terrifying scream than you could have ever imagined in your entire lifetime. As soon as it made contact with him, he woke up. He sat up violently, heaving massive breaths.

The scientist realized immediately what he has just experienced. He quickly grabbed a piece of blank paper that was sitting on the desk next to him. He had prepared this beforehand, and expected to die right then. But he didn't. But he looked over to the exit from his room. Standing in that exit was the figure from his nightmare.

The figure whispered ""y-you didn't think you c-could get away that e-e-easily did you?"" The scientist's eyes widened with terrible fear. He managed to whisper ""what...what are you?"" The figure rushed towards the side of his bed

The scientist was a lonely man. All of his family was dead, his friend came to visit. He went to his house, and knocked on the door. No answer. After a few seconds, he smelled an incredibly horrid stench coming from the house. He walked around to the back, and looked in the bedroom window. Inside, it was dark. But he could make out the decaying figure of his friend, who had been in there, and they picked up his body. The cause of death was simply labeled ""Old Age"". But they found the paper next to his bed. It was filed away in evidence,,False

I walked along the small room in which my subjects were bound.  One man and two women stripped of their clothes.  It was quite a sight to see.

I turned the older man and women towards each other and removed their gags. They screamed “HELP! SOMEBODY HELP!”  It seemed like great fun so I joined in.

In the middle of all the yelling

I proceeded to make a shallow incision from his belly button to the middle of his chest.  I peeled away the skin and threw it on the woman watching.  I laughed as she violently tried to shake it off.  She wept bitter tears.  I walked over to her.  She spat on me

“Oh no no no.  You need to learn to play nice

I made quick work of that one,” I giggled.

Her arms were the next to go

I walked over and tore off her right ear.  I applied too much force and fell backwards.  I laughed as I threw her ear behind me and dusted myself off.  I threw away the saw and left her there whimpering with Teddy.

The third woman had seen the previous treatments the other two had undergone and became frantic as I looked at her.  I walked over slowly.  “Don’t worry, or I will perform the same surgery on you as well.”  She looked at the knife, then the woman, and then nodded to me.

I removed her foot binds first.  How can I trust a woman with a knife?  I removed the bound hand not in possession of the knife.  I walked over to the table the legless woman was on.  I pushed over the table and yelled at her. “GET THE FUCK UP YOU LAZY BITCH! Oh

I picked up the legless woman and sat her down on the table next to the woman with the knife.  “Well

The exchange of the final two victims always fascinates me.  A silent conversation in which the victim pleas with the potential killer to let them live and go after me.  It makes me blush and get all giddy when I think about it.

The woman with the knife gauged out the eyes of the woman with no limbs.  I watched her slump over

I put the knife down and walked over to the stairs leading upstairs.  I looked back at the victims: my father, limbless, and my wife, slit throat missing one arm.  I’m just glad my kids, who were watching through the viewing glass got to see what fun daddy could have at work.

It was a nice day outside, I think; I hadn’t seen any other stores. The Shelves always had weekly stock, something new to check out. They even had music sections that I would occasionally browse. The owner of the store was pretty mice, at least 30 or so, pretty laid back. I had just gotten a Game Boy Color which was a bit after its release (2000) so I went, as usual to the game boy cartridge section.

There was an interesting cartridge on the very top shelf; I was only 12 so I couldn’t quite reach it. I found the stool that was kept around here somewhere and was finally able to reach it. The cartridge was hard to take off the shelf

“Is this game free?” I said with a surprised look.

The owner took it from me and just shrugged as he saw the label

“I guess it is.” He then handed it back to me

I put the cartridge in my pocket as I began my usual round of the new stock, I went home. All the way home I was stangely intrigued by the blank cartage, I was ready for anything. When I got back to my room it was just as I had left it, typical 12 year olds room. Spiderman posters left and right, supplies ready for school on Monday, and my old clear Gameboy on the bed. I jumped into bed and popped the cartage in; while it was loading I was expecting some crappy game that never took off.

The Menu was what looked like an 8 bit field of grass; A setting sun in the distance. There was also no title, just 1 block wide. Seeing no challenge I jumped. I hit some sort of invisible wall and fell into the pit. I press the start button on the menu. The sun seemed about 3 or 4 pixels lower, nothing too odd; it just unnerved me a bit. I came to the pit, which seemed to have come earlier. I got over the pit this time, feeling a bit accomplished. After a bit of walking I came across a sign; the sign was very detailed for a GBC game. The game told me to press B to read the sign.

“Don’t let the sun set…”

The sun, I felt so rebellious, which was a mistake. The sun finally set, the screen almost pitch black. I touched the block and died again. The next time I played it was broad daylight in game. I just began to walk, and walk…and walk. I seemed so into absolutely nothing. I felt myself getting absorbed into the game. I was just walking.

So one day the world blacked out. I was placed in a game store, then I ran into a block and died. The next kid suffered the same fate, but I felt a decade-long spell being lifted as he did so. I was free. So that made me wonder, am I nothing but some sick and twisted game, doomed to walk a plain for the rest of my life, doomed to pick up cartridges in game shops? Maybe it’s not so bad; taking a walk sounds nice, doesn’t it?",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/132nhm/simple_game_first_oc/

A twig sprung to life, vines wrapped around the man, ripping at his jeans as they deep into his legs, the blood squirting onto the now wilting grass. “What the he-” He was interrupted, the skinny thing wrapping a hand around his throat, clutching as hard as he could, bursting the windpipe. 

Tempus mori.” The creature said gently, sending a shiver down the killer’s spine, unable to respond in oral, as his vocal cords were now a bloody mess, pouring from his mouth. 

It was the last thing he had heard, mangled and helpless. 
The Slender Man stood there, to be locked away as nobody could help. He had his own game now, planted onto his body.
The suited figure disappeared in the shadows, they would think he did this, to the girls and boys, to the killer. He laid his blank face upon his chest, hidden in the darkness. 
Because things weren’t always as they seemed.

There is a man in my basement. He is standing on a box and has a spoon in his mouth. I call him the Teetering Man. The Teetering Man doesn't know when his end will meet him, remove the spoon from his mouth and feed him. He doesn't know how himself. The Teetering Man is the product of a relationship I had with a woman long ago. Twenty years ago the Teetering Man was born. He last saw sunlight twenty years ago, when he killed my wife and left me with a life off loss, pain and suffering. So all he has ever known was pain and suffering. He will never see sunlight, he will never have friends of family, he will never know relief or comfort. All he will ever know, is pain,,1343313547.0,t3_x490x

1340572584.0,vjf75,The Reapers ,MrsPyramidHead,48,19,20,"You’ve heard of Death, nothing more.  I’m not supposed to tell you this. I’m really, am I telling you at all? Because I believe that everyone deserves a fair warning. A fair chance to change their fate.

The first thing you should know is that death is not a single being, in tribute to the Grim Reaper persona. They judge a person on their character and behavior harshly and efficiently, having no mercy and no care for life. They are the ones who can send you to a peaceful afterlife, or to rot in hell.
 
Also, is a reaper and who is not. Reapers usually begin to appear around children in middle school, though of course there are exceptions.  One reaper is assigned to maybe 100 or so children, so the child:reaper  ratio, if you will, is quite unbalanced, and I suppose that it a good thing. There are maybe 2 or 3 reapers a school class or grade, maybe 1 or 2 in the office/workplace.

Now, or the rich ones, and are seldom nice to be around, and very quiet. They are the kids/adults people dislike, and the ones who people tease and ignore. The freaks, geeks, and loners.  The kids that no one really knows or cares to know where they are from

There are also physical things to look for, and they notice too much attention from you, they can and will watch you much more closely. Firstly, their skin is slightly more pale than normal, not a sickly white like movies portray, but instead a shade lighter than everyone else’s. Their veins also sometimes are more visible under the skin that a healthy human’s should be, and their nails are barely purple, rarely

	Now what do you do with this information? I’ll tell you what you do. You start to figure out who the reapers are in your life, being a suckup is probably a smart choice. Don’t tell anyone you read this. Don’t trust anyone. If someone mentions this to you, say you’ve never heard of it. You never know when they could be testing you. How do I know all this? I cannot tell you. I wish I could, but I can’t. I’ve already said too much…",,False,self,False,t3_vjf75

1366085964.0,1cfwso,Footsteps,mightytoe,35,6,2,"Yesterday was your 14th birthday and your grandfather bought you a digital camcorder.  Now you are standing outside the abandoned office building wearing a backpack with a flashlight

The first thing that hits you when you walk into the building is the musky smell.  The air is cool and damp and your footsteps echo loud in the building as if it were a cave.  You scan the room with the flashlight.  The crumbling walls are bare and the ground is littered with papers.  The rooms have no furnishings.  You take a deep breath and begin walking around the first floor.  The building is dead silent

You are filled with adventurous excitement.  Soon you have completely walked through the first floor and recorded every room with your camcorder.  Sunlight pours through the windows and illuminates many rooms.  All of the rooms are empty.

The last door on the floor doesn't open up to a room but instead to a concrete stairwell that descends into darkness.  You turn your flashlight on.  There is nothing down here.  Dread grips you as you take slow steps down

Surprisingly the next room is even darker.  As the narrow cone of light slowly scans the room you see a pile in the corner.  You pick up each object and film it.  It’s mostly old office supplies and you take the only interesting thing:  a half used pack of matches.  Unable to contain yourself

Again the next room is darker than the last.  It isn't even really a room, down the hallway, chased by echoing footsteps.  At the very end of the hallway there is a second set of stairs that go down even deeper.  The floor down there is dirt, not concrete. 

You take a deep breath.  Each step down the stairs is quieter and quieter until the echo is completely muffled by the bare dirt floor.  You scan the room slowly from left to right and see a large collection of desks and chairs piled neatly.  You only have a minute or two left to film so walk into the room towards the desks.  After each step you check the stairs behind you.  Fear has you expecting to see some figure standing menacingly at the top of the steps.  Nothing.  Then you see it.  At first it was a glance out of the corner of your eye but it quickly draws your full gaze.  Far off at the end of the room is a lone white mannequin posing with its hands in front of his face as if the light from the flashlight was blinding.  Your heart drops and you want to run outside

You walk slowly towards the mannequin at the end of the room.  You are flanked on both sides by orderly office furniture that completely encloses the room.  The mannequin itself is surrounded by chairs knocked over on their sides.  You walk until you are a foot away from the figure.  You film the figure for a moment.  Up and down and left and right, and it does not turn on.  The room is unimaginably dark.

**It’s not a big deal.  It’s fine.  It’s fine.**  You stick your hand in your backpack and feel around for replacement batteries.  Your hands are shaking so hard that it’s hard to screw the top back on.  You flip the switch.  Nothing.  Again, nothing, nothing, nothing.  **Maybe they are in backwards.**  You unscrew the top again but then you notice the footsteps.

Step.  Step.  Step.  You stop moving.  Your eyes widen.  You weren't hearing something.  There are definitely footsteps above you, the whole time steady footsteps echo above you.  You flip the switch.  Nothing.  **Fuck, fuck, fuck.**  You just sit there stunned.  Your eyes are wide and your hearing is focused on the footsteps above you.  You hit the flashlight against the ground desperately.  Nothing.

You pat yourself down in desperation for a source of light.  **Matches!**  It takes almost a minute of you fumbling in the dark to get the match to light.  The whole time the footsteps are echoing in your head.  The light is blinding at first but after a moment it lets you see the room again.  You quickly scan the room.  Nothing.  You quickly but quietly move towards the stairs.  Towards the footsteps.  You don’t want to go up but you cannot stay down here.  At the foot of the stairs your match goes faint.  You drop it and light another.  Initially the light blinds you but your eyes adjust quickly.  **Please don’t be standing at the top of the stairs.**  He isn't.  You check behind you.  The light is too faint to fully see but you see desks and chairs.  

**Okay.**  As you walk up the stairs you start to hear your own footsteps.  You try desperately to walk quietly but each time your foot hits the concrete the sound reverberates and amplifies off of the walls and fills the building.  You know whoever is down here hears you but you can’t stop it.  You want to call out, step up the stairs.  By the time you reach the last step the match has gone out.  You take the match pack out of your clenched fist and strike another.  The paper is damp with the sweat of your palm but it the match lights nonetheless.  You look around the room in front of you.  When you see the mannequin standing motionless in the corner you want to cry.  **This wasn't here last time.  Someone moved this.  Someone moved this.**

You sprint out of the room

You don’t remember where your backpack and camcorder ended up, now the steps lead to more darkness.  You run up them and trip.  The match goes out.

Your hands are violently shaking as you strike the last match.  You look back

Your heart is racing.  You can feel it beating in your head.  Time is lost in this panic.  You are feeling the cool wall with one hand and holding the other one in front of your face.  You realize that you have been crying.  You don’t remember when you started.  Then you hear those footsteps again.  You are screaming but you cannot hear yourself you can only hear the footsteps getting louder and louder and louder and closer.  You are basically sprinting right at least until you trip.  Your momentum launches you tumbling down the stairs.  Each step sends an echoing crash down the hall.  At the bottom your body falls onto the soft dirt floor.  It feels cool against your bare body.  You get up and knock over some chairs in a panic.  Then you hear it.  The FOOTSTEPS are at the top of the stairs.  They descend down slowly.  Step.  Step.  Step.

Your voice is trapped in your throat.  A bright light fills the room.  It is so intense that it burns your eyes and you have to protect your face.  You are too terrified to move.  The light is held by a terrifying figure who slowly approaches you.  It's wearing your clothes.  You don’t move an inch.  He gets within a foot of you and shines the light up and down your naked milky figure.  Then he takes his ugly grey hat off and puts it on your head.  “This is the creepiest place in town.”",self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1cfwso/footsteps/

My eyes are adjusted to the darkness

I move my lips and I can feel the air cross my aching throat but it’s no good...

I’m pretty sure I’m in a vehicle of some sort

I had a breakthrough although not what I had hoped for. I managed to break something behind my head and move my head more than I had been able to prior. I have about 5 more inches of movement and when I move too far I feel like something is shocking the back of my neck. The pain is instantaneous and very excruciating.

Something is cutting into my right arm with large hypodermic needles coming out of a large tubular structure

I saw a man in the corner of the room, calves, neck and head. He was very strong from what I could tell, he managed to break off all of the connections to the table and started to walk towards me. I can see his mouth move but I can’t hear him say anything to me, I’m sure I was screaming at him but again I couldn’t really hear anything. He took about 5 steps before realizing that the “caterpillar” was still attached to his arm and he didn’t have enough slack to make it to my table. He gently pulled away from the caterpillar tube and I can see the 30 or 40 hypodermic needs slide out of his arm. The look of abject horror on his face made me wince as I try to not get sick on myself... I haven’t eaten in so long, what would I get sick on myself with?

He had freed himself of all of his bonds. He staggered over to me looking disoriented, he crumpled to to the floor into a fetal position. His bluish colored face and purple lips indicated suffocation. I frantically reached over and felt under my left arm to see what was holding me there. Jesus, was I next? Why am I not dead? I stared at the caterpillar tube for a moment, what am I breathing if it’s not oxygen? Not exactly a good situation if your scared of needles like I am.

After freeing my self from the table, but let’s try not to think about that right now.

My stomach tightened up, I have strange things embedded in my flesh. Where the fuck am I!? I curled back up on the table like the dead guy on the floor and start to cry, dry heaves making it so hard to breath.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1288qv/an_interesting_nightmare_i_had_a_while_back/

I heard this story once as a girl when I was at a slumber party. I have not heard this story told by anyone else before, as good urban legends usually die out with time. This is my attempt to preserve it, and to add on some extra details to make this story feel more alive to the reader.

Not too terribly long ago there was an American businessman, and was recently spending quite a bit of time in Japan. His latest business deal had really taken off, and he was due to meet with another firm in Tokyo to buy some wealthy real estate with much potential. 

This last deal essentially fell into his lap, etc. He caught a cab to the airport and quickly checked through security, making it just in time to grab a cup of coffee and a magazine and breeze through to his first class seat. 

Everything was going smoothly until he was informed that his connecting flight was delayed due to maintenance issues, the meeting would have to be put on hold until Mr. Brown could arrive, as nothing could be done in his absence.

Finally, he phoned the hotel he was supposed to be staying at to let them know to send a taxi. The woman on the other line informed him, ""I'm sorry Mr. Brown, but we have already assigned your room to someone else. It is very hard to secure a room here in Tokyo, you should have informed us hours ago. We tried calling you."" He had completely forgotten, in the midst of all the chaos and business planning, to inform his hotel that his flight was delayed...he missed his check in time. ""Well, I'm exhausted, there is a hotel about two blocks down from us

Without even thanking the woman on the other line, they had a room. 

He took a taxi to the Jade Flower Inn and immediately when he pulled up he could see the place was in dire need of repairs. The sign hung drearily from its post and the roof was damaged. It sat tight between what looked like a bakery and a small bookstore. However

Mr. Brown tipped his taxi driver and made his way inside. The inn was much nice than its outside appearance. The woodwork was lavish and ornate, the man handed Mr. Brown his key, labeled ROOM 12. Mr. Brown awkwardly smiled back at the man behind the desk and gave him a thankful but tired nod and turned to head up the steep staircase to his room. However, he suddenly paused when he thought he heard the old man about to say something. Mr. Brown turned to face him, ""I'm sorry I didn't hear you"". The old man returned his response with a rather solemn look on his face. He looked down at Mr. Brown's hand holding the key to his room, then back up at him. He then waved his hand at Mr. Brown, ""Nothing"" he said in broken English. Mr. Brown ascended the stairs towards his room

He fidgeted with the lock when he got to his room and clumsily swung open the door. There was something about the room that struck him as peculiar. It had all the decor of the lobby downstairs...but something didn't feel right. That's when he noticed it was the walls...they were made of rice paper! ""How strange, fumbling with the buttons on his suit when he heard a soft ""click"". The light had gone on in the room next to him....and he could see the shadow of a figure faintly appear on the rice paper wall across the room. 

Mr. Brown froze for a moment, very tall, and thin. She had long flowing hair that, even in the shadow, he could tell must have been black as night. The figure slowly sulked over to what appeared to be a vanity against the wall and sat there for what seemed like an eternity. Mr. Brown was scared to breathe, there was something about the woman that seemed...unsettling. 

He flinched when the woman finally moved, reaching for a brush. She began to brush her waist-long hair. Over and over. Suddenly, Mr. Brown wasn't very tired anymore. He was curious, very curious. He could see her supple breasts jiggle in the dim light and she brushed.  Her hair, he could almost smell it. Mr. Brown's loneliness seemed to creep up on him in that moment. When was the last time he had felt the soft flesh of a woman against his own? He has been so busy working, trying to make a life for himself...but what life was this? He just wanted to know what she looked like...she didn't seem to notice him, standing there with his tie half undone and his mouth open like a buffoon. No one noticed him. 

So he crept up to the rice paper.

He made very sure to approach her shadow from an angle behind her, a little closer to her figure this time, but still she did not flinch.

She just kept brushing her long

Mr. Brown decided now was his chance

But all he could see was red.

""Whatever, hoping the woman wouldn't hear him on the other side of the wall. He tucked himself in under the sheet, leaving the lantern on so as not to hint at his presence to the figure in the other room. 

He fell asleep to the sound of her brushing her long

Mr. Brown awoke in a sweat, he was about to get up from the bed to get a glass of water until he heard a noise. A familiar noise. He shook his head to clear the fog, and looked over his shoulder at the room next to his...the woman was still sitting at her vanity. That's when he recognized the noise...she was still brushing her hair. It was nearly 4 in the morning and she was still brushing her hair. 

He slowly rolled back over and listened to the sound. This time it was not soothing...he slipped back into his nightmares.

Mr. Brown jolted awake to the sound of his alarm. He had overslept and was about to be late for his meeting. He rushed to get ready, no more than late twenties, early thirties...some even had sneakers on! They smiled and greeted him with handshakes, very different from the types of partners he had been meeting in other parts of Japan. They offered him a seat and hot coffee with pastries, they chatted a bit and then moved forward with the plan to excavate a large area of land and to use as a plot for several commercial buildings. 

Mr. Brown liked his new comrades, and one of the men offered to drive him to his hotel. 

When they pulled up to the inn, avoiding the judging stare of the old man behind the front desk, and clomped up the stairs to his room. 

He fumbled with the old lock again and opened the door

He quickly looked over to the wall across the room, he could hear her sobbing.

Mr. Brown trembled

He was scared.

He watched the woman,  either drunken courage or sheer stupidity. But he had to know...he wanted to know what she looked like. This sick, sad, beautiful woman. Why was she doing this?

He approached a spot a little closer to her on the wall

He licked his middle finger and made a tiny

At this moment Mr. Brown struggled for a flask he had left in his suit jacket and finished the remaining contents. He buried his head under his pillow and quietly hummed to himself. Anything to drown out that horrific sound. 

Mr. Brown awoke the next morning in a sleep deprived hangover. However

He grabbed his things and trotted down the stairs towards the lobby. The old man was at the front desk

Mr. Brown cleared his throat. ""Excuse me, in front of the old man. ROOM 12. 

Just as Mr. Brown started to leave, ""I  have to ask you a question. You see, I was staying upstairs in Room 12, obviously, and I was wanting to know something."" The old man looked up from the desk. ""I don't know if you can tell me anything about this, or if you are allowed to...but there was a woman staying in the room next to me. In Room 11. From what I could tell, she was very tall and thin. She had long black hair. She seemed to be very beautiful. But she seemed troubled. She spent a lot of time brushing her hair."" The old man's eyes seemed to glaze over. ""I know this all sounds crazy, ""I just...I just want to know if you know anything...about her."" The old man slowly rose to his feet, long time ago. She was Japanese kabuki actress. Very tall, in room 11."" Mr. Brown's mouth went dry. ""She killed in a bad way

Mr. Brown shook his head forcefully and wiped his brow, a real woman!"" The old man leaned forward over his desk, ""You know, that woman...she was not famous because she was so beautiful, or her hair or how she was so tall."" Mr. Brown looked at the old man, puzzled. ""She had one thing no other kabuki actress had, no other woman in all of Japan.""

""What?"" asked Mr. Brown

This is my take on an old creepypasta I enjoy. I always wished there was more to the story so this is my effort at it. 

Clive walked down the dimly lit street in the French Quarter. Garbage was strewn threw the gutters and small

A gentle autumn breeze briefly made a halo of his cigarette smoke and whipped at his smartly cut

Finally

He took a right on Chartres and walked along the large concrete wall outlining the convent’s grounds. As he walked

Well

His gaze shifted to the closed shutters of the attic and the blessed nails keeping them shut. He thought of the fate of those poor women centuries ago as he walked deeper into the cool autumn night. 

As he passed the steps in front of old St. Mary’s

He approached the small wall between St. Mary’s and the next building and knocked sharply three times. His knocks were returned three times.

A voice questioned him

“The light of pure art

“Very well

The wall squeaked and rumbled lightly. It was opened inward and Clive was allowed to pass. His inquirer was nowhere to be seen. 

The passage was dark and shadowed by the buildings on each side but a few feet down he saw a faint light streaming from underneath a door. Upon reaching it, fully stocked bar complete with bartender and various other patrons obscured in the surrounding booths. 

He took the appropriate seat at the bar. 

“What shall you be partaking in this night?” the bartender asked warmly. He was a large

“Absinthe, please.”

“What kind would you prefer

“The stuff the Man himself could not bear to take

 “Ah…” breathed the bartender

 “One moment then.” 

The bartender quickly ducked into a back room behind the bar. On his return

“Be sure you handle this drink with care

When the bartender finished pouring half the drink, he recognized the shape as a key. Good, Clive thought, I may yet survive the night.

Clive poured the ice water over the sugar slowly until the cube was no more and then stirred the glass gently with the key-shaped spoon. The liquid became cloudy. He removed the spoon key and placed it on the bar. After appreciating the beverage and glass for a few moments, a premium absinthe. His knowledge of the ritual went no further than this. Whatever else that lay before him was from the whispers of madmen and facts had no place in their shadow.

Upon opening his eyes

As the horrors of possibility ravaged his mind

Eventually

Upon finding the spoon key again, it appeared his spoon key would fit. The door resounded with a loud mechanical snap as the key found its place in the lock. 

Clive tried to retrieve the key but it was stuck fast in the machinery of the lock now. The door slowly slid open to reveal the innards of a modern elevator and a beautiful woman bathed in the green glow. Clive stood stunned at her beauty.

“You’ve kept me waiting

Clive gulped, Clive thought.
The elevator machinery clicked and whirred as the carriage began to rise upward. She smiled and it warmed him. Soon

The elevator door slid open to a great marbled hall. Lamps lit with an unnatural flame cast a perfect light of clarity on the works that hung there. Clive was awestruck. Here was Beauchamp’s gallery. According to legend

I still remember the last time I saw him. He was so scared to leave me, and grandfather had died: shot in the side and drowned in their own blood. Maybe that’s why he hit me all the time…maybe that’s why the last time he had the gun…he was scared. Yes, that must be it…

I hated him when he hit me. I hated how it hurt. But most of all, grandfather and brother before him. I hoped he’d hurt when he died, hurt like he hurt me when he knocked me down and pressed the cold barrel of the gun to my temple, or my heart…or my eyes. My eyes…he loved them so, so much. He used to tell me all the time that they were beautiful…and oh, now he’s going to die because I wished it on him!

His mother always sits beside me when I’m quiet and thinking, because it will only make me worse. She tells me that he’s sent letters, and when I feel up to it I can read them. She tells me I’ll only get sicker, but how can I not worry? She did the same thing, she told me, and so did her daughter-in-law…they all worried. But they also wished for the deaths of their lovers…horrible because of the abuse. It saddens me to know that they all hit the women they loved. But we loved them back, nonetheless. ..I just wish I could read his letters. 
But how can you read with no eyes?

Aidan. I HATE you, put me in this miserable darkness, this “coma”? Why am I lifeless and you are alive? What is it that I did to you?


I hope you do get shot, and you hear me welcoming you into your own hell, Vietnam, and you relive the last time you saw me…when you shot my eyes out. And I hope that you can’t live with it, so you imagine a better scene of leaving, where you didn’t have to run from the room you put me in, bruised, gaping holes where my eyes once were.

And I hope that you relive your death, and you’re terrified. I hope I meet you in hell, Aidan Clark.

1365675109.0,1c4kea,Light in Your Eyes,GLKnight,31,6,3,"The local news has had a heyday with the latest event. For the past 3 weeks

“He had no defining features, like a corpse. Except for his eyes.”

There was no clear description of the killer. Heights were different every time

You’ve been inundated with this topic everyday. The local news breaking into anything that had a national audience, your parents, Facebook. This “Jack O’ Lantern Slasher”, as some people have been calling him, has left every authority baffled. There has been no pattern to his killings, indiscriminate about sex, politics, wealth, that lasted 3 minutes

There was some blood spilled at that uprising. But the Jack O’ Lantern Slasher has made that look like the stain of spilled grape juice by a five year old.

KPTV has been the worst about it, they will shove a microphone in someone’s face. As the death toll mounts, more and more victims begin to emerge, mostly inadvertently with how Fox has been forcing their affiliate to put more screen time on the killings. But the more you are exposed to the body count, and the “public opinion”, the sicker you get with it each day. You just want it to stop, and for all of this to just go away. But with the numbers that tune in for the latest bit of information

Tonight was the worst of the media’s onslaught. Literally every channel you turned to had to deal with some aspect of death, tuned into Milton Ridge. Every viewer, forced to peer into your town and investigate every person that lives there. And you had the unfortunate response of threatening bodily harm on the report, demanding that you be left alone. You were neither victim, nor villain, and were not going to be portrayed as such. Too bad that the reporters cut into you during the 10:00 news broadcast. You turned off the TV, and angrily threw the remote across the room.

“DAMN IT!”, and refuse to leave me alone, and yet I’M the one that deserves ridicule?! FUCK THEM!”

You turn your attention to the kitchen, you think. You choose to put it out of your mind, and look out of the window by the sink in the kitchen.

Your home is small, but a good distance away for your privacy. It’s cheap, which means you don’t have to scrape and save as much as most people you know, and utilities are rather cheap as well. The real reason you chose it, though, was the forests around the house. You recently decided you wanted to get a dog, and the woods would be perfect space for it to be happy. It’s solemn, and more than enough to put you at ease. Well

The light for the backyard drew your attention outside, it’s late, and that you needed to get some sleep. You were going to probably call a lawyer and press charges. So, you reach for the light switch, and deftly turn it off. As you proceed to pour the bottle into the sink, you reach over to turn off the kitchen light, too. Soon, and you rub your tired eyes. Sleep sounded like the perfect remedy to your day. You drop your hand

Out in the woods, deep in the woods outside the window. Whatever was out there was perfectly still, but within quick distance of your home. There is something… alluring about them. They seemed to dance, but refused to move. Whatever it was, it seemed like it was calling to you. It wanted your attention. It wanted YOU to come to it, for you to stare into it.

You quickly shake your head, you throw the empty bottle away, and proceed to bed. You had to be ready for tomorrow. You were going to make sure that you weren’t made a joke.

As you make your way through the house, choosing to change into your pajamas in the dark, instead of some more light that will antagonize the headache that’s been building in your head. You just want to get to sleep, and take care of your business tomorrow. But you know that your only really comfortable with some airflow in your room, so you turn to the window in your bedroom. You push aside the hanging curtains, and slide it open.

You close your eyes, and you open your eyes again.

Deep in the woods are two white lights, there’s a new detail: the outline of a man, darkened by the shadows of the woods, and standing perfectly still. You can’t tell what he looks like, but you know he stands transfixed on your home. You don’t know what he wants. Your home, valuables, or maybe you specifically

Your head begins to pound as the headache you were feeling begins to quickly transform into a migraine from Hell. So you shut the window, and you slip into sleep. Now is your time to experience eternity.

As you sleep, even your own hands in front of your face. You mold yourself into a ball, shivering and unable to fend off the feeling of abandonment. You know you serve no real purpose, except to live, to eat, to shit, and to die. You can feel no love, no emotion at all except fear and abandonment. Then off in the distance

The more you stare at it, and it calls out to you. “Embrace me. Take me into yourself. Make my heat your source of comfort and purpose. Give yourself to me, and allow me to use you as fuel for my purpose.” Its’ words eke out more and more of your sense of self, and you find your will slipping. You feel a heat in your hands, and you raise them in time to find yourself catching in flames. The same flames that now have you surrounded. You try to scream, but all air is sucked out of you. You grow blind with the bright light that now has you trapped.

Unable to breathe. Unable to cry. Unable to be yourself anymore. And you burn.

You wake with a start, twice, and hold your breath, but your heart will not stop. And that’s when you can feel the cool air all around you. You think that your sweat from your nightmare has made you chilled, until you notice that the curtain by your bed has begun to flutter in the breeze, and a bright light shines from outside. A bright, white light that seems to make the shadows dance.

You spring from your bed, and stand transfixed by your view.

Outside your open window stands a priest, nothing except the white fire from where his eyes are. He stands staring directly at you. Not, not at you. THROUGH YOU. You’re sure he can see something in you, but you’re not sure what or why. You just know that the fire within him has you entranced, and you cannot turn away.

The fire calls to you. “Give yourself to me. Serve a purpose, unable to turn away. You can tell the priest has begun to move, as you feel his hand grab your arm, but you offer no resistance. The fire begins to grow brighter, as you feel a burst of heat from the priest’s hand. Intensity mounts, as the fire’s light matches the pain in your arm.

You begin to see visions of an ancient time. A Middle Eastern man strapped to a beam of wood, and an earthquake, and a torn cloth. A pillar of fire in front of the man, telling him that the man’s Father has cast judgement of eternal exile, helping others to find the rest that he will never get. To never find and comfort, and solace only once in any place that he might stay. Many dead people by his hand. A Samaritan passing that man, and offering him help. White fire jumping to the Samaritan, and his eyes bursting into flames. Many dead people, taken over by white fire

You jump back to the priest, BRIGHTER, BRIGHTER…

And that’s why you were on the floor. You cannot remember it, and you shall be the instrument through which I will enact Heaven’s accord. So onward, Christian soldier. I cannot stay here anymore. We have more people to give their due reward.

(Transcript from breaking news on KPTV

Local: It’s senseless. No one should die so horribly. Especially children…

Carl Stanton: Good morning, as many have been dubbing him, has struck again, officially propelling his numbers to over 100 last night in a brutal killing spree. Live in the field is Christine Winthropp with the latest information. Christine?

Christine Winthropp: Yes, before seemingly disappearing again. It seemed that the murders began in Milton Ridge just 5 miles away, but in what authorities deem to be about 2 hours, he made short work to outlying Milwaukee, where the Tahlmud family was the last batch of victims in his path.

Carl Stanton: And there has been word that the daughter of the Tahlmud family has apparently gone missing. Am I correct

Christine Winthropp: Yes

Carl Stanton: And there was a bit of evidence that alters the current investigation as well

Christine Winthropp: That is correct, authorities are not sure of the gender or age of the supposed victim. Forensic experts are baffled to how the body could be burned so thoroughly in what they purport to be the span of a few minutes at most, and leave behind little to no evidence. Never the less, they will continue to sift through the remains, in hopes of finding the additional victim found in the Tahlmud’s home.

Carl Stanton: This is just an absolute nightmare for all of those involved. I pray that Lori Tahlmud is found safe and sound. Christine Winthropp,,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,True

He said it should be done on the darkest night of the year, and muffling noises might be in order. In order to prepare for the event, you have to have been awake for at least 4 or more days in a row, no sleep, no rest, almost no food. Rest yourself on a bed or a couch when you’re ready, and turn on a very soft, as he was taught.

As you stare at the ceiling, a vague outline takes shape, humanoid in appearance, but clearly present. Don’t blink or turn away, he said, for that prevents you from making things take shape. As the rippling effect picks up speed, the figure will become more detailed. By this point, but you have to resist the sensation until you complete filling in the details. Certain details like eyes, your eyes should be in serious pain

Then, to try and touch you. DO NOT DO THIS. If you do, you’re bridging your time and space with theirs, and by that point, you will vanish from reality altogether. Continue staring at the figure, until it looks exactly like a person is in the room with you. By this point, your eyes will be beyond the normal threshold, for you have one more thing to do. If you can resist

Who are you?

Where will we meet?

When will we be together for all eternity?

Ask any other questions than these, and a clap so loud, you shall no longer be able to hear a thing. And worst of all, this one chance at connection will be lost for all eternity. But if you are successful, the bridge shall be completed, and the figure shall slowly fade from above you. And you will be able to go on with your life, with the comfort of knowing your destined meeting.

But he also warned me about something else. The process only really works because of what lies in your heart. Lust, hatred, jealousy, or any other form of wickedness, and the effect will prove disastrous. “Love can only be truly attained with a pure heart,” he pleaded, “and any other desire outside of the pure will call something other than what you intended. If this does happen, then you will belong to it

“I was lucky”

Like I said, but I’m ready now. As I’m writing this, the bottle of Scotch to get me ready for this is almost empty, and if I fail, then I’m going to kill myself immediately afterwards. If I’m going to be alone, then I’m going OUT alone as well. No point in wasting time, huh?

Pray that I succeed. I’m… I’m just so SCARED of being alone.",self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1byo61/strobes/

There stood a man. Barely visible, and yet I could not unsee him. He was looking at my grandfather, but turned his gaze to me before I could say a word.

I had all the gear on, just eerie. The mist shrouded the mountains around the bridge. And there was the voice. Out of nowhere. “Go on, Tom. Jump. Go on.” It was faint, it was almost like it wasn’t me talking, some sort of being taking control.

“You’re so slow, Joel.”


That’s when I spoke up. “Hey guys, cluck! Buq buq buq!” Andrew joined in. Their cruel cries tortured me, if there’s one thing I can’t stand, it’s being called weak. The voice started laughing. “Fine. Let’s go.”


I get into my harness and stand at the edge of Insert Bridge. “You go first

My vision was blurry and absolutely everything hurt. I could make out was that I was at the mouth of some sort of cavern or cave. I could see the river underneath Insert Bridge and it was absolutely pouring. I was soaked to the bone. I attempted to get up but was soon followed by a sharp, just thinking about what happened, I had completely forgotten about the voice. And there it was. It felt like something was watching me, something in my presence. I turned around and saw nothing, turned back around and a flicker at the corner of my eye.


By now I had established that there was something else here, it was alive. I was immediately aware, my body rejected all the pain and pushed it away. My senses came back to life and I could feel everything. I tried to look around but my neck locked in place, the muscles denied the input from my brain. Everything around me turned cold and lifeless and I felt something coming up behind me. I began to lose consciousness but not from pain or injury, even though my injuries were great. It felt like everything was shifting away to the back of my mind, and something was taking over. It had replaced me. I could still hear everything. I could still acknowledge everything that happened to and around me. I just couldn't control my body. I didn't know what it was, it seemed dark and evil so I was too scared to try and communicate. My body rises, penetrating my mind. ""You're alive! Guys, slammed his fists on my chest and proceeded to hug me with the force of a million bears. Mind you, the nurse had gone on and on about how I'm lucky to be alive.

A few moments later, guess it was my body, but I had no way to tell them, but- Never mind. It took the nurses a while to diagnose what was wrong. At first they thought it was a coma but they realised that I was still reacting and moving, so they ruled that out. Apparently I'm mute from shock and unable to talk for a while. I'm not going to lie, I'm angry. This thing inside my head is still here, still there, and you know what? That's exactly what's going to happen. I think it's like a seed

Ok. So. A few nights ago (I’m lazy and just now felt like posting this) I went to bed around 11:30 and watched a couple episodes of King of the Hill like I do every night. It got to be 3 in the morning before I decided I needed to get to sleep. I turned everything off and laid in bed for an hour or so before falling asleep. When I finally did, the stuff on the floor, I was even wearing only my boxers like I do every night when I go to bed. My dream starts off with me just lying there while I hear my parents in living room talking. I can’t hear what they’re saying, but it slowly starts getting closer and closer. They get to my door still talking and come in, where I close my eyes and pretend to be asleep. As soon as they walk in, they stop all conversation, even though they were mid-sentence a second ago. They just start walking around the room not talking to each other. After a minute of this, but I can see a figure standing directly in front of me even though she did not move after saying bye. All signs of my mom are gone at this point and the figure stays right there staring at me. I’m too scared to open my eyes so I lie there, but my door’s wide open and I see something out of the corner of my eye. Lying on the floor at the head of my bed is what looks like my little brother, but nothing was coming out no matter how hard I tried. I remember the feeling of being paralyzed in my dream. Like I said before

My room mate, he was cool and kind of nerdy, spent a lot of time just sitting on his bed with his laptop and cracking jokes.  
Anyway
The rooms are just large enough to have a small carpet and two beds on either side of the room.  Oddly enough my room mate was sitting up on his bed just like he would if he was on his computer, just...sitting.  The worst part was that I could feel it watch me from his bed, so I looked up and tried to get a good picture of the creature.  We watched each other for a few seconds, then it stood up and for lack of a better description melted through the floor.
I fell asleep that night, so convincing myself wasn't so hard.  
I woke up the next morning and looked over to Tony's bed to see him sitting up on his computer.  Laughing to myself about how stupid last night had been I jokingly said ""You should probably move
He laughed back and said ""how would you know
I stopped laughing and told him I got in at one in the morning and he was sleeping soundly
Terrified and intrigued I found the room's old inhabitants, saying he thought he had seen someone.
The house had been built in 1994 and I would have known if someone had died in the house, then I saw the Copycat again, standing by his closet the same night he saw it sitting on my bed again.  This continued on and off throughout the semester, sometimes only one of us would see the Copycat and sometimes both of us would.  
This continued until the night Tony and I stole our friends Batman mask and hung it up on the wall by our door.  That night Tony reported seeing the Copycat staring at the mask like it was angry that we would put it there.  I found it on the ground the next morning several feet away from where it was hung like something had knocked it away.  The next night I walked into the room at two in the morning to see the Copycat standing over Tony's bed staring at him while he slept. That was when I learned what my room mate meant when he said it seemed angry.  The black outline of the Copycat was more solid
A month or so later things had calmed down some, lay my head down.  Just as I was closing my eyes I heard a breath drawn inches away from my face and a woman's voice whispered my name in my ear.  I shot up just in time to see the Copycat walking into my closet.

I was one of the many people who were afraid of clown. As a kid I trembled

The kids were playing in the yard

He introduced himself as “Bonko” and sat on our couch. He really was your classic clown. White make-up, big red nose, an orange wig, the works. Laura asked if she can bring him anything. He declined. He sat in our living room for something like 15 minutes, smoking and tapping his shoe on the floor. He seemed nervous and I could swear I could see him drinking out of a flask. “Is this your first time?” I asked. He chuckled and without looking at me, said “It always is…”. I did not understand what he meant.

After finishing his smoke he put on a happy clown grin, and tried to relax me.

Bonko went outside and started the show. He juggled, did some classic slapstick. Even I had to admit he was good. And the kids were just entranced.

“And now for the big finish” he declared. He took out three colorful boxes from his bag. They looked like birthday presents. “Pick one

Mikey thought to himself. He looked so cute

“Oh boy! Good choice!” He said in a cartoony voice. Though I swore I could hear some sadness in there. Bonko opened the box and took out a knife.

Laura and I were shocked

I looked inside the other boxes. In one was a small rifle and in the other a can of lighter fluid and a box of matches.


All the kids, and they just looked to the floor ignoring us. I decided I can’t let this blow over. I tracked down the company that sent the clown.

It was in a small two story building. I expected a run down

I looked around. In his office were blown-up pictures of clowns with their faces cut off, faces burnet off, it was terrible. And every picture had poor, young children crying.
The manager was a skinny man in a tie. He looked to be in his late 40′s and had big bulging eyes. “Why do you this?” I yelled. He didn’t answer

“I will find someone who will make you pay! I will not be silent!”. He smiled at me and motioned his goons to hold me in place. “Do you love your family?” he asked. “Of course” I said “That’s why I’m here!”. ” “You made a mistake

The Captain and the Flight Attendant make their way down a dark stairwell to the ground floor.  They rush to the front desk.  Nobody is there.  The staff has vanished.  She slaps on a service bell repeatedly.

“Hello??”

“Who was the guy who checked us in earlier?  I can’t even remember what he looked like.”

The Captain jumps the desk and roots through drawers.  Finds a flashlight.  Grabs a stack of key cards.

The Mother tears through the dark hotel halls

They suddenly arrive at a floor where all the lights are on.  They squint as their eyes adjust to the light.  This floor is clearly undergoing some renovation...

Long hallways stretch out before them

The door to every room on this floor is wide open.

They burst into room after room.  Each one nearly identical.  Each one completely vacant.  No signs of life.
Out of nowhere

They exit a room and find a maid standing down the hallway with a cleaning cart.  The stocky maid’s face is obscured in shadow.  She seems to stare at them through the cover of mop handles.  Stock-still.

The Mother and the Businessman look back at her.  Uncertain.

The Mother calls out

The maid does not move.  Does not respond.

The Businessman takes a step toward her.  “Excuse me

The maid suddenly starts pushing her cart toward them.  Moving faster and faster as she advances.  A sense of determination in her movement.  She pulls a steel tool out of the cart that resembles a cross between a butcher cleaver and a corkscrew.

The Mother and the Businessman duck into another room and slam the door.

In the room

The maid abruptly stops banging on the door.

The Mother looks at his pistol.  “Why do you have a gun...?”

The Businessman is at a loss.  “I...”

She starts to back away from him.  “Thought you said you were a businessman.”

He approaches her.  “I am...  I-I just keep this for protection--”

“Don’t come near me.”

She suddenly notices there’s a small figure lying in the bed here

The Captain and the Flight Attendant make their way through the darkness of the second floor with the flashlight.  A hotel staff member quietly stalks them from a distance

The Captain starts opening doors with key cards.

Empty rooms.

Empty bathrooms.

Empty closets.

Every so often

They turn a corner in a hall and see someone standing at the far end.

It’s the Younger Flight Attendant.  Facing away from them.  Just standing there

“Becky...?”

The Mother rips the sheet from the bed...

She picks up the mannequin and throws it against the wall.  “What’s going on here?!”

The Businessman approaches her

She turns on him:  “I told you

The Businessman slips the gun back into his jacket.  “Listen

“I don’t want to hear it.  I’m not in the habit of accepting drinks from strange men who carry concealed weapons.”

“Would you rather be with someone who was unarmed right now?  You have to trust me.”

“I don’t have to do anything except find my daughter and leave.”

The Mother looks around the room.  Checks under the bed.  Opens up the closet.  Runs into the bathroom and pulls aside the opaque shower curtain.

There’s no one here.

She leans against the sink.

The surveillance camera behind the mirror zooms in on her face as she goes through a range of emotions.  Panic.  Frustration.  Anger.  Fear.  The camera adjusts and makes a whirring sound which she seems to notice.

She stares through the mirror

She picks up a plunger and bashes the wooden handle against the mirror.  The mirror cracks.  Shatters.  The camera zooms out to a fixed wide-shot.  She reaches forward and takes the surveillance camera in her hands

“I want my daughter back

She yanks the camera out – the feed goes black.

In the darkness

The Younger stands there with her back turned

The Captain calls out from a distance: “Don’t touch her...”

The Older ignores this and turns the Younger toward her.  Her eyes are wide open

“What is she covered with?”  He checks her vitals.  She seems to be normal.

All the lights on the floor suddenly blink on

The Mother combs through the bedroom

“What are you doing?”

“They’re watching us.  They’ve got cameras planted all over this place.”

“Who are ‘they’?”

“Whoever they are

As soon as she destroys a camera

The final camera frames a clearer view of the locked door.  Before she can destroy the camera

The Businessman draws his gun.  They both tentatively step out into the hallway.

It’s empty.  No sign of the maid.

Somewhere further down the hall

The Captain and the Older carry the Younger out of the elevator and through the ground floor lobby.  Lights and electricity have returned but the place is still deserted.

“We’ll get her checked out at a hospital

“We should try the landlines again

“We just need to get out of here...”

“Becky?  We’re coming for you

Basically there are two friends and one of them finds a bag of videos in his cellar/basement and they watch the vids together- the videos have no talking and are just of some guy watching people from bushes etc, ""we shouldn't look for this guy anymore because that's what he wants us to do""- so he goes back to his house, then comes back to visit his friend and it turns out his friend has become obsessed with this video weirdo guy and has gone a bit mental. At some point it's found out that the video guy was living in the obsessed friend's shed. I think the shed is then burned down? Not sure... I think the moral of the story was that this video guy spreads his evil weirdness by people watching his videos and talking about him- the more you talk about him, the more likely he is to come visit you.

It was a hot summer day
""We are here"" Said Conner's mom.
""Can't wait"" I mumbled on the fact that my parents have forced me to go with them. We take a step inside the house taking a look around. Two floors with a kitchen, No basement, and long hallways leading to each room. 

Skip ahead one week, Explore the forest nearby, eat, sleep. Not exactly the ideal summer spent but it was okay with me since my life was dull as is. The worst part though was for some reason each night. Conner would wake me up because of the bone chilling cold there was each night.

This stayed the same way another week until I got woken up again. But not by Conner

I walked downstairs into the kitchen to see Conner warming himself near the heater.
""Feeling cold"" I blurted out
""Screw off""
""I can't believe you didn't wake me up"" I said back
""How about you stop being a dick and go to bed?"" He said back with a small yell.
""Whats your problem?"" I asked
Before saying anything else he came up to me and held me by my shirt. But before he could say anything else the floorboards beneath us gave away into a hole about 5 feet wide and 4 feet in length that had a lot of smooth curves

I fell down about ten feet while Conner fell about three
""Help me out of here!""
""Why should I?"" He said back with a smile.
""What?! Why would you want to leave me here?"" I said back.

Conner didn't say anything back

The next morning I hear his father coming towards the kitchen in a kind of ""Just woke up"" Walk I picked up from my own father. I then heard him making coffee

Having hot coffee splashed in my face distorted the image

What I believe is half an hour later I hear Conner stepping into the kitchen. I see him walk across the edge of the pit holding a small metal crowbar. After standing on the other side where I can't see I hear him call out for his mom. Shortly after his mom arrives asking what he wants. Conner says nothing. 
""What is this hole?!"" She asks right before looking over the pit

Conner's mom gasps after seeing me there

Goodbye Conner says to his mother.
""You are sick! Why would you do this?""
""Because I don't want to live like how I am

The next thing I remember is him throwing down a chair making me fall. As I start falling

I come back to reality and whip out the pocket knife and stab the wall. It stick in and catches my fall, then stabbing again.

Yeah well, there’s this old bridge down in a valley that crosses a small river. It’s not far from here, If you want I can take you out there. Yeah, we can go tonight.
The legend usually says a mother was rushing her sick baby to the hospital and ran her car off the bridge. The story also goes that the mother got out of the car, but this is usually the gist of the tale. Well, the truth is, the valley was haunted a long time before anything like that ever happened, and it wasn’t haunted by some woman screaming for her lost baby. Not then at least.
You see, look just like us. Once it’s on them you can’t tell them apart from us. What they look like under the skin, nobody alive now knows.
The woman in the story, but she didn’t run off the bridge. She came close though, and she seemed to be in luck, as a truck came along just minutes after she ran off the road and smacked a tree. Her lights were still on, and the driver of the truck spotted her waving in the middle of the road. What happens next, well… it’s pretty horrible. You see the driver of the truck, well, and he was wearing the previous owner’s skin. He pulls over, and its appetite overtook it. He ate the baby right there in front of the mother. Jaws split like some sort of horrible giant snake, being a much bigger meal than a little baby.
The real horror of these things is, it doesn’t move on like it does after a normal death. It lingers, you see. How do I know all of this? Well, I grew up around here. My grandfather told me all about it. He was one of the cops that found the car, you see. He ran across one of those things here in town once. Said it looked like a person, just didn’t seem to move right. His grandmother was an old Indian wise woman, she told him stories of the skinwalkers when he was a child.

""Just let us know if you need anything. Sorry we didn't have anything available up front

James lingered for moment, but the outside looked clean, and the lobby and check in staff in particular, appealed to him on some level he couldn't put his finger on. James got into his truck and pulled around to the rear of the building where she had told him that he could find his room. A variety of cars with a larger selection of state license plates sat quietly along the building. He found a spot several doors down from 60 and pulled in. 

After the satisfying beep and the flashing green light lit up on the keypad

""WHAT THE FU..."" he started to say loudly as he took another breath in. Nothing. No smell offended his senses. He breathed in through his nose cautiously at first. A slight smell of musty curtains and generous amounts of lemon cleaner were all he could detect. He moved around the room carefully, behind the tv, sniffing as he went, nothing. *that's some weird shit right there*.

James pulled his luggage from the doorway into room and tossed it onto the corner of the bed. He turned the television on and flipped through several channels, pulling the comforter up and looking underneath. It was an old fashioned bed, one without the box underneath to prevent items from being stored or pushed underneath. The carpet underneath was mostly clean, with only a few specks of lint underneath. Up near the head James saw a larger white object that looked somewhat shiny, but it was far enough back that it wasn't worth the effort to try and fish it out. James walked over and lifted his suitcase on top of the dresser next to the TV. He stripped off his shirt and pants, kicked his shoes next to the bed, and fell into the mattress face first. He halfheartedly watched TV for a few minutes, plunging the room into darkness. He closed his eyes and listened to the sounds of trucks passing by on the nearby interstate. James had almost drifted off to sleep when he heard a slight sucking noise in the room. Immediately he snapped awake and reached for the switch to turn the lamp back on. He felt the lower sheet cling to his arm and shoulder for a brief moment. He looked around the room and saw nothing. *dude's getting sucked off next door or something*

He snapped the lamp back off and laid back down. Several quiet minutes passed and he was drifting back off to sleep when he realized that he felt warm. *Warm but not hot* He mentally struggled with staying conscious and evaluating his current comfort. His back started to feel warmer and warmer

Rosa opened the door to Room 60. Standing outside for just a moment to let the festering meat smell pass before she entered. None of the maids liked cleaning the room, Nothing was left behind and it did not appear to have even been used. The guests NEVER checked out of Room 60. They always just disappeared sometime before the cleaning staff arrived at 4am. Nothing was ever left, and the room looked as pristine as how they left it. Rosa leaned underneath the bed. Using a broom she swept the pile of shiny white rocks towards her. She swept them into dustpan and looked at them. *Every time, teeth.* The staff and the owners of the Ramala Inn didn't talk about the strange occurances in Room 60. Numerous detectives and private investigators had come to their hotel over the years asking questions about missing persons. But there was never anything to be found. No cars, no bodies, no leads. Just a pile of teeth under the bed in an otherwise pristine room. Rosa stripped the comforter off along with the top sheet. Nothing marred the crisp whitness of the fitted sheet below. Never a hair or a sock or any of the usual things maids find in the bed. She billowed out the sheet and put it back into place, fitting the comforter back onto the bed. Rosa felt a slight tingle in her pocket and reached in to retrieve her phone. She sat down on the corner of the bed and started reading a text message from her brother. She felt herself overcome with an overpowering urge to *just lay down

teeth shredding his wrists. Her moans became more ecstatic ash she relished his pain and fear
starting to crush his pulsing member within her as her pleasure mounted greater heights. Her juices felt like lava 
on his flesh as they coursed from her in rivers.

The bitter wind blew in through her window, being in and out of the way the road, had no street lights near it. And the only light in the forest, came from within her home for the heavy clouds covered the moon. She sighed and walked back to her computer. She leaned her head against her left hand and began browsing the web. She soon came to a website devoted to scary stories. She wasn't a big fan of scary stories but she was bored out of her mind and figured a good scare might liven up the night. So she came across a story about the Slenderman. She read the story and the ending sent shivers down her spine but not as much as the picture that accompanied it. The tall man in the picture peered at her with it's pale blank face. She felt, somewhat uncomfortable, as if the man was actually watching her. Soon enough, she forgot about the tall man ans continued browsing the web until she came to a site, showing off their chests and what not. She began feeling quite, lightly tapping her window. She hauled on her nightgown, a soft article of clothing. As she lay her hand against it she could feel the heat like she had from the tree. She was very scared and could not say a word. She reached over to the wall with her other hand and found the light switch. The light illuminated the room revealing that her hand was leaning against the crotch of a tall man's pants. She gasped as she drew her hand back and she saw it was the Slenderman who was looking down at her
A loud scream could be heard from within the house, things were slammed against the door and the legs of the bed where being snapped under the pressure. 

She awoke the next morning

I woke up that morning, I will fuck it up. That day was full of anxiety and nervousness.

I stayed up all night that night. Not like I could sleep anyway. I lay on my pillow, not yet. I lay frozen for half an hour, waiting for it to approach me. But it didn't. It just chuckled that raspy chuckle. I couldn't take it anymore, I sat up and looked at whatever it was. And what I saw has kept me awake since. This... thing... it was tall, at least 8 feet. It looked naked, beige, leathery wrinkled skin. It's face though. It had no eyes, staring into me. I pointed my gun at it and yelled ""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU?!"". And it just stared. But then it's face contorted. Where a mouth would be
""I am the beast under your bed""
""I am the monster in your closet""
""I am the tapping on your window""
""I am the face in the dark""
""I have been with you since you were born. I will be with you until you die. I am here because

The next morning I was passing by the comic shop and I had an idea. Jacky and I love watching the Walking Dead together. I had been in there recently and they had these zombie plush dolls. Even though she was scared witless by the zombies, took one look at the doll. No laugh. Not even a smile. She stormed in and threw it on the couch in frustration, going out side, probably to ring up her parents and bitch about me. Fine if she was going to be this difficult, two could play at this game.

For the next few days Jacky wasn’t home much so I would constantly hide the doll around the house
I was ready to give up. After a week of not talking I knew I had to do something. I stormed into the lounge room holding the doll, it keeps showing up. It’s like my friends are playing a prank on me. How can someone do this, especially with Dave’s funeral on Friday”. I was was so angry by this point I was only half paying attention as I grabbed the doll from the bin. It was an expensive doll and if she wasn't going to appreciate it then I was still going to keep it. After I got inside I threw it in the wash.

“No


“Because, “the motherfucker's haunted.”


Which settled that.


I tucked my keys into my pocket around nine and left the dorm, the sweet smoke whirling away into the September air.


“It's not exactly The Overlook, built back at the turn of the century, but it lacked the beauty and character of most old buildings. Living up to its name and not an inch more, it was a three-story cube with a pillared porch. Even from the sidewalk, even in the dim glow of the streetlight, I could see the many layers of once-white paint chipping away, sometimes pulling away from the structure in long scabby strips.


Jeannie passed me the cigarette, and the occasional joint. “Nah, it sucks. Some decent stories though. If any of them are true.”


I took the last drag


“Parlor, front desk, obviously. Dining room over here, and kitchen past that.”


I wandered through the first floor, Jeannie should have known that. One of our earliest roommate bonding experiences had been realizing we each got the same spinal frisson while working stage crew at the school's oldest theater where a long-dead actress was rumored to move props and pinch sopranos. Ghosts were palpable, we'd always agreed, and spiritual energy could be tasted on the back of the tongue, like batteries or bad wine.


Not that it wasn't spooky in there, and with only the check-in desk lamp to light the whole first floor, the effect was eerie. The sitting room boasted furniture that was worn and used enough to give off a musty smell, but not old or pristine enough to qualify as antique. There were too many pieces crowded into the room and shadows swam around my shoulders.


The White Inn got just enough business to stay open year after year, and this was one of them.


“No guests at all?” I asked


“Nope


She led me upstairs, did I realize why she had brought me here.


At the first landing, the hint of electricity, the undeniable feeling that all was not well.


She glanced at me, if either of us had possessed enough extra breath to laugh. All the oxygen had gone out of the air, as though it was Everest we were climbing instead of a set of creaking stairs in a small-town hotel.


The second and third floors were all guest rooms, the light bleaching her away, flattening the gloss of her black Velma Kelly bob. I looked one direction, then the other. The hallway to the left was short, holding only four doors; the righthand hallway stretched further and featured a sharp corner halfway down.


“Guess someone died here, it'll come to me.”


She was speaking in the hushed tones usually reserved for libraries and funerals. “The really good one is the other way. A guy stabbed his boyfriend and left him in the bathtub. He was halfway to Tucson before they caught up with him. Roger says he knows a guy who can lead a séance


She trailed off, leaving me with a run-of-the-mill adrenaline spike and shaky hands.


Finally


She went right. I followed behind her


Jeannie disappeared around the corner. I paused, nearly covered by the shuffle of our feet along the brown carpet, but unmistakable. A gasp. Not from ahead. From behind.


Just as there is nothing so terrifying as sounds behind a closed door


I whirled, there was something there, my brain insisted, but my senses told me no, actually, there wasn't, and the argument between reason and panic made my breath come short and fast.


I heard it, certain I had missed something, certain that any minute the gasping thing would peel itself into view and reach a wasting arm for me... My spine throbbed. I know I heard it.


I gaped blankly at the mundane scene before me. There wasn't even a wrongness of angles, sharp inhalation of breath, and the plain hallway seemed unspeakably sinister for its lack of monstrosity.


And then


A spider. White.


Hanging from the ceiling on a nearly invisible filament was a white spider. It was level with my nose; another step and I'd have swallowed it, not even a half inch from leg to leg.


It had been there the whole time, but they must have registered its presence on some level. Nearsightedness had always been a minor inconvenience, but this time, it had scared me half to death.


The spider hung motionless, slack and loose. Its eyes were either absent or so white that they couldn't be distinguished from its pearlescent little back.


I stared at the white spider, and I had no idea what it meant to find this-


“Are you coming or what? Christ!”


Jeannie poked her head around the corner in the righthand hallway. Either I was in too much shock to show it


I looked back


“Yeah


Jeannie showed me the righthand hallway's sights, rattling elevator (devoid of blood, thank you very much) down to the lobby. We drank sodas from the machine at the front desk and Jeannie regaled me with rumor after rumor.


“The boyfriends are a sure thing, every stage, every hotel, must be crawling with ghosts if you believe all the stories. Just sells more tickets and beds, I guess.”


I was flicking the tab back and forth on my pop can


“Yeah


I put my hand on her arm to stop her from getting up. “You said something else. The boyfriends and who?”


“Oh! Mrs. White


“True fact?” I asked, turning to the left...


“Legit. Not the owner's sister, thinking. The wisps floated back down like spider silk. “Cousin, maybe. She killed herself while she was visiting. Anyway, that was on the second floor, too. Top of the stairs.


“Damn


My hands fell away from the poptop and I gripped the desk. “What happened to her?”


“Are you okay?” Jeannie looked me over. “Did you see something?”


“Just-” I licked my lips. I was staring at Jeannie, an answer I could not yet see. “Just tell me what happened.”


“I told you. She killed herself. It's not a great story, visiting her sister or sister-in-law or whatever, she went up to bed and then... next day, they found her.”


“Where? How?” I whispered


“Just outside the first room on the left. There's a pipe in the ceiling under the particle board.”


-but I found that my sight had shifted and I already knew-

Do you know that feeling, and it pipes up again. It feels like a second person inside your head.

I was 15 years old

I had all the gear on, just eerie. The mist shrouded the mountains around the bridge. And there was the voice. Out of nowhere. “Go on, Tom. Jump. Go on.” It was faint, it was almost like it wasn’t me talking, some sort of being taking control.


“You’re so slow


“Stop your whining


“Shut up! Let’s just go


That’s when I spoke up. “Hey guys


“Hey Tom!” I look around to Joel, if there’s one thing I can’t stand, it’s being called weak. The voice started laughing. “Fine. Let’s go.” I get into my harness and stand at the edge of Insert Bridge. “You go first, Tom. We want to see you fall” said Joel. The instructor steps up behind me. “3! 2! 1!” The voice starts to laugh. “Jump!” I fall off the bridge, and I hear a snap.


My vision was blurry and absolutely everything hurt. I could make out was that I was at the mouth of some sort of cavern or cave. I could see the river underneath Insert Bridge and it was absolutely pouring. I was soaked to the bone. I attempted to get up but was soon followed by a sharp, just thinking about what happened, I had completely forgotten about the voice. And there it was. It felt like something was watching me, something in my presence. I turned around and saw nothing, turned back around and a flicker at the corner of my eye.


By now I had established that there was something else here, it was alive. I was immediately aware, my body rejected all the pain and pushed it away. My senses came back to life and I could feel everything. I tried to look around but my neck locked in place, the muscles denied the input from my brain. Everything around me turned cold and lifeless and I felt something coming up behind me. I began to lose consciousness but not from pain or injury, even though my injuries were great. It felt like everything was shifting away to the back of my mind, and something was taking over. It had replaced me. I could still hear everything. I could still acknowledge everything that happened to and around me. I just couldn't control my body. I didn't know what it was, it seemed dark and evil so I was too scared to try and communicate. My body rises


""Tom! Tom!"" I could hear sirens. Flashing lights and everything around me was dark, STUPID kid! You had me worried sick! I, I thought you died!"" The crying had taken over. He came up to me, slammed his fists on my chest and proceeded to hug me with the force of a million bears. Mind you, I still hadn't said anything yet. In the midst of the happiness I was feeling, I forgot my fears of this being that had infected my mind and attempted to talk. What I thought came out of my mouth. ""Oh my God, Joel! I can't believe I'm still alive! The craziest thing happened! I fell in a cave and then there was this thing and the-"" I stopped. I wasn't speaking.


By this time I was in the back of the ambulance with all the guys, it wasn't exactly me, guess it was my body, but I had no way to tell them, but- Never mind. It took the nurses a while to diagnose what was wrong. At first they thought it was a coma but they realised that I was still reacting and moving, so they ruled that out. Apparently I'm mute from shock and unable to talk for a while. I'm not going to lie, I'm angry. This thing inside my head is still here, still planted, then I might be able to get rid of it.

I have watched you as you sit in this room observing the little life. You cannot see me, a little bit more of myself is transferred to that side, and a little bit more of it is transferred to this side. It is a strange feeling, sharing two bodies. I am still unable to exact control on the other side. I can wait.

1334506760.0,sawr0,Normal Porn for Normal People,Graapaape,30,8,12,"Everybody knows that if you surf the web long enough

The first strange thing about the site

    “Hi there 

    found this site is very nice thought u might like 

    normalpornfornormalpeople.com 

    pass it on

Pretty standard issue chain letter

It was a very average, boring, and incoherent rant that I don’t remember or have saved.

The site had a strange tagline (which even today people haven’t figured out the meaning of)

    “Normal Porn for Normal People

And from the sound of that, very curious to see what “Normal People” get their rocks off to. So I scrolled down through the rant and…nothing. The page didn’t seem to link to anywhere else, and I was about to leave when I noticed every word of the rant was it’s own hyperlink. So I clicked one of them, and was sent to a white page with very long list of links in the form of:

    “normalpornfornormalpeople.com/ (random letters)” 

So I stopped for a minute and asked myself if I really wanted to waste God knows how much time clicking random links that will likely give me a virus that will rape my computer. I figured I’d just try it for maybe 5 minutes

I was just about to say “Fuck this” when I clicked on the 3rd link, and the man would set it down for the dog to eat. This was all that happened, for 30 minutes. It was obvious that the cameraman had to stop filming and wait until the dog was ready to eat again, and the dog seemed rather sick by the end of it.

I know what you’re thinking: “What the hell does that have to do with porn?” I have no clue. I’ve seen a little over two dozen videos from this site

After watching peanut.avi, some guy who had received the same chain letter I did. The image board thread got lots of people with nothing better to do to dig through the site, and that’s how I saw other videos.

Most of those two dozen videos where very uneventful, sterile feel to it.

The conversations where just idle banter about previous jobs or embarrassing childhood moments. I kept expecting some kind of discussion about what the people where filming or what the site was about, the people who appeared in these videos where quite attractive.

However

I’ll give brief descriptions of the stranger videos

lickedclean.avi     A 10 minute video filmed by a hidden camera in which we see a repairman working on a washing machine for the first 2 minutes. When it’s fixed, and he begins to lick all over the top of the washing machine. This goes on for 7 minutes. 

jimbo.avi

    A 5 minute video of a obese mime performing his act. It was actually pretty funny, the camera cuts to static briefly and cuts back to the man sobbing quietly, still wearing mime outfit and makeup. Some kind of obscure fetish? 

dianna.avi

    4 minute video in which the camerman talks to a woman in a room different than the “interview room”. This room looks like one you’d find in a normal person’s house. Exactly where they are is never specified

    I didn’t notice this until someone on the image board thread pointed it out

jessica.avi

    Another 4 minute cameraman video. This time he’s outside a house

    The strange thing is: No one so far has been able to identify where this street is. Guesses have ranged everywhere from Europe to Australia to The Philippines

tounguetied.avi

    10 minute video. The first 5 minutes consist of an elderly woman making out with a mannequin. The video cuts out like it did in jimbo.avi halfway through, there is no sound. stumps.avi

    5 minute long video where a man with no legs is attempting to breakdance on a DDR mat in what looks like the kitchen from peanut.avi

    He breathes heavily and pleads with someone off-screen to let him rest. This off-screen person becomes terrifyingly enraged and yells at him to keep dancing

privacy.avi

    The woman from dianna.avi is masturbating on a mattress in the “interview room”

    The door in this room was always closed in other videos, you can see an animal quickly run through the hallway. 

And finally the last video we uncovered: useless.avi

    In this 18 minute video, but he does not enter. 

    He holds the door open for the animal that was running in the hall in the previous video. It’s revealed to be an adult chimpanzee, the masked man closes the door behind it. The chimpanzee sniffs the air for a moment (it may have been blind), and notices the woman tied to the mattress. It goes into a frenzy, and begins to maul her. 

    The assault goes on for a grueling 7 minutes


The thread exploded with activity after this video was uncovered, sent him 5 messages and never got a response.

I have tried to discuss this website on various places

The only proof that normalpornfornormalpeople.com ever existed was a few screencaps people took

Wherever you upload them to

In the background, dragging suitcases.  Although they seem rested, they wear their own dull, dazed expressions.  This hotel is a way station in the middle of nowhere.  No one stays here for longer than one night and a stay here invariably means you’re still a long way from your final destination.

The Daughter gravitates toward an old

They make their way to the elevator banks where an airline pilot and two flight attendants are waiting with their luggage.  They look like they’ve been through their own harrowing evening but manage to smile sympathetically at the weary-looking mother and child.  The Older Flight Attendant crouches toward the Daughter and admires her dog.

“What’s his name?”

“She’s a girl.  Her name’s Diablo.”

“Pretty name.  She’s lucky to have you.”

The slight frown on the Daughter’s face doesn’t budge.  The elevator arrives: an antiquated deathtrap with a claustrophobic cab.  Parts of this hotel are clearly overdue for renovations.  The aircrew lets the Mother and Daughter take it.

The elevator lifts off with a heavy

They arrive at their floor and drag their suitcases down the carpeted hallway.  The Mother scans the numbers on the identical doors.  They pass by a middle-aged man in a gray suit and glasses

The Mother stops at a door and tries her key card.  The door won’t open.  She tries a few more times

The Businessman approaches them

“Thanks

“I’m right next door, lingering a little longer than comfortable before he lets himself out.

In the hallway

The Captain pauses at his door.  “If either of you ladies are looking to forget the flight we just endured

The Flight Attendants walk into their room.  The Older flops on her bed as the Younger begins to unbutton her uniform.

The Businessman sits in the dark on the edge of his bed, creating a strobe effect.  A private ritual he’s done a hundred times in a hundred different hotel rooms over the years.  Watch him for a moment and he just looks sad; watch him for a few moments longer and he looks downright insane.

● ● ●

The Mother leans against a dresser with a thousand-yard stare.  The Daughter sits on the bed and lets her dog out of its carrier.  The dog scampers about the hotel room and pisses in a corner.  Mother and Daughter are both too numb to react.

The Mother breaks the silence:  “You know

“Where are we going?”

“Somewhere far.  Far enough to be safe.”

“We’re not safe now?”

The Mother lets out a deep sigh that seems to relieve tension pent up in her body.  “Sure we are.  No one’s going to hurt us here.  We’re just in the middle of nowhere.  We’ll find someplace new to settle down.  Start over.”

“Does that mean we can never go back home?”

This seems to sting the Mother more than she’d care to let on.

“I don’t think we want to go back

The Daughter tears up.  “You didn’t let me say goodbye to any of my friends.  Not even Jenny.”

“I know you must think I’m some kind of monster but I’m doing the best I can.  We’re on our own now.  I promise we’ll find someplace really nice and you’ll meet new friends—”

“How do you know that?  You don’t even know where we’re going!  You think it’s easy making new friends?  I could be miserable...”

“Becky

The dog leaps up onto the bed.  The Daughter grabs her into her lap and strokes her as she sulks.  The Mother walks over and sits down on the bed

The Mother heads to the bathroom, she slumps down in a corner far away from the door and has a nervous breakdown.

The Older Flight Attendant lets her hair down as she sorts through her suitcase.  The Younger stands by in a bathrobe

The Older brushes this off.  “Every so often, just to break up the monotony.”

“What do you mean by ‘monotony’?”

“The boredom

“Why didn’t you just say ‘boredom’?”

“Look

“Was he drunk?”

“He’s strictly an off-hours drunk.  He was stone-cold sober tonight.”

“How do you know?”

“Because we’re alive and not being covered by the evening news.  Take a shower

The Younger heads to the bathroom.  Runs the shower: calcium deposits in the shower head skew the stream and it blasts her face.  She shrieks with surprise and adjusts the angle.  Drops her bathrobe.  Steps in.  Steams rises up.  She lathers shampoo into her hair.  The surveillance camera in the room suddenly zooms in and we get a closer appraisal of her anatomy...

The Captain opens the door and lets the Older Flight Attendant into his room.

The bed is littered with empty little bottles of booze.  The Captain cracks the seal on a fresh bottle.

“Close to killing the mini.  May have to graduate to the hotel bar in the lobby.”

“Were you drunk up there tonight?”

“Have a drink

“I want to know what was going on in that cockpit.”

“I’m going to need you to drink a lot more before I start opening up about what happened up there.”

The Mother steps out of the bathroom.  The Daughter has fallen asleep on the bed.  The dog is barking as someone raps lightly on the door.  The Mother opens the door and lets a service attendant push a food cart into the room.

“How much do I—?”

The attendant leaves without making eye contact

She removes the cover from a plate

The Mother pulls some covers over her Daughter.  The Daughter instinctively clutches onto the sheets as she settles in.

The Mother grabs her purse and quietly heads out the door.

A moment passes after she leaves...

My avid interest in the human body began as a young teen, electronics, even a bed. I was so curious; I just wanted to know what made up these things. What made them move, come alive, do what they do. It was such a fantastic mystery, pulling apart a computer to find millions of parts that hum and vibrate. The only problem is that I could never put the mess of bolts and bits back together. Eventually my parents got sick of me destroying things in the house so they would buy me books to try and quell my unrestrained desire to pull apart objects. Sadly that only subdued me for so long. After being hit, beaten, until I started learning about the anatomy of animals.


I think we’ve all squished spiders and killed ants…whatever the reason may have been, and I was relaxing outside. Our dog, Alex, brought me a present, a rat. I remember ripping it from Alex’s grasp, feeling the rat, which was still alive, a single heart beat. I had felt my own before, so I had a clear view of the rat’s heart. I was amazed, tearing the rat to shreds and covering the table in guts and blood. After I could cut no longer



As I grew older, and we were learning about the anatomy of animals. Specifically, the frog…And I had been waiting so long for the day we would get to dissect it. It came painfully slow, and when it did come I was so joyful and ecstatic I was shaking. Frogs didn’t usually hang around my house, so this was a first time experience. We were working in pairs and I hadn’t even noticed who my partner was. My face lit up when my teach set down a small metal tray with 2 frogs neatly taped to it. We were separated into sections with small walls in-between each section, giving everyone privacy. Each section had a small trashcan under the table to dispose of the frogs. I sat down next to my partner and took the scalpel and my partner began to talk about what we to do…I completely ignored him. I began cutting away; inspecting and savoring each thing I cut out. It went from a slow and steady pace to a rampage. I simply cut and cut, feeling a growing sense of bliss. My partner stared with complete disbelief at me, walked up to the teacher and told her I had to go to the nurse. My partner never spoke to me ever again.



But now…I can’t contain it anymore. I went to medical school to try and become and surgeon but I can’t wait. This morning I called the cable company complaining about my TV acting up, and began to peel away little bits of muscle and skin. I had reached the tendons, and one by one I began to pluck them out. Each pluck sent a shock through his body, and finally I undid his hand strap. He tried to move his hand, but it hung limply. He was barley conscious now, so I gave him more painkillers. I then began to work at his legs, repeating the process I did with his hands. Now his legs were raw and both his hands and his legs were bleeding freely. Before I could finish his legs he passed out, and fell into my old habits. I slashed and stabbed his legs, ripping open his mouth. I cut his throat near the top and pulled his tongue through. I finished by completely ripping his vocal cords out and cutting all along his neck.


I got too curious, where the heart was. I took as many painkillers as I could and began to cut and cut. Looking down at my bloody torso I felt pure and utter joy, and then it happened. I pulled out a small red object, and it gave a single beat.


...One slow and utter beat

1361194585.0,18qziu,Deathbells,Goodapollo184,31,8,2,"I promise that I'm not crazy. This happened. Whether you believe it or not is entirely up to you. I know it happened. I was there

It was August 27th, Guild Wars 2 would launch, and I had an entire night planned playing with my friends. I worked the late shift, so I got off at around 10:30, immediately headed to the store to buy it. My friends and I waited in line for an eternity. I had pre-ordered the limited edition, and was eager to get my hands on it. I had never been one to play MMOs. WoW had never interested me, and the only thing close to one that I had played had been Runescape. But that had been years ago. My friends recommended Guild Wars to me, needless to say

Finally getting my hands on the copy

Arriving back at my apartment, and I simply grinned. Rushing to my desktop and cracking open a soda, I set to work on installing the game.

I had never been a fan of the Charr as a playable character, and once I was in Queensdale, I took a deep breath and fully appreciated how much work was put into the game. I quickly snapped a screenshot and uploaded it to my Facebook. Then I dove head first into the game.

I spent the next few weeks, but other than that nothing too major to report on. 

After about the third week from launch, in relatively good health. It was a shock to everyone. 

It was three months before I picked the game up again. I don't really know why I did; what could have lead me to do it. But for some reason seeing the copy sitting on the shelf collecting dust struck me as unjust

The first night was normal. My friends and I had created a guild on launch and it was easy to track them. They seemed surprised to see me

There were a few things I noticed as....off? I guess that would be the word. But I dismissed them easily. It had been months since I had played the game

The first thing I noticed were the monsters. When you killed one, I found nothing other than maybe a few copper pieces and an item I had never heard of. It was called a Deathbell. I wondered if it was some sort of new crafting item so I checked the stats. There was nothing in the description. Just question marks. There wasn't even anythign indicating if It was soul/account bound. Upon trying to sell it I recieved quite a few errors and eventually gave up. I tried searching for it online and in the Black Lion, but nothing. I simply destroyed it and moved on. I never commented on the transparent figures to my friends. I figured they already knew and were used to it. I prefered to skip the talk of being demoted to n00b status again.

Other than that single occurance

I logged in the next night, where it would normally be flooding with other users asking about events and other things. But this time, it was empty. And Lion's Arch was devoid of players. Only NPCs stood around. Thinking I had just gotten a weird world, I tried switching. The same thing over and over again. I tried about 10 different ones before finally giving up.

I even tried restarting the game

I don't know what possessed me to keep playing after that, everything. But I froze as I got to my inventory. The night before I had collected about 15 deathbells before finding out they were worthless and destroying them. Now the slots they had been in had been filled with a new item: ""Wilted Deathbell"". Again, no stats, simply question marks. But I couldn't detroy them. It didn't give me the option. The only option it gave me was to use it, and I decided that might not be a good idea right now.

Finding it a little unnerving to be running around in an MMO devoid of players with and inventory full of wilted flowers, blasting at full volume in my bedroom, echoing off the walls and making me jump from my bed and lunge for the speakers. 

My heart was pounding as I turned the volume down. I'm not sure if it was the being scared awake that was making it nearly pound through my chest, well, isn't that what you do when you wake up scared? Turn the lights on like it's going to deter some murderer who was intent on killing you anyway?

I fumbled for my phone amongst the heap of things on my desk, I headed to the kitchen to make myself a drink.

As I returned to my room, but the screen was lit and the game was on. Over it was a text box, almost like an error message, that simply said, ""PLAY"".

Someone had to be screwing with me

The game was still empty

You can only imagine how lonely it is to play a massive community game with no one in it. I searched every area of Tyria that I had discovered. I even went to new places. Nothing. No one. Not even a peep from an NPC. The game was eerily silent.

Unnerved I found my way back to Queensdale

That's when it happened.

I hadn't looked at my chatbox in a while, there was a single word, ""Hello"".

I looked up to remind myself that I wasn't in a party. Cautiously

???: Hello
Me: Hello..?
???: What level?
Me: 40...
???: Good.
Me: Who are you?
-No response-
Me: What happened to all the players?
-No response-
Me: Answer me! 
-No response for about 10 minutes
???: Pinh ouin vaync eh dra aoac uv taydr. Pinhehk dra fayg ihtan dra taydr pamm vmufan.
After that

That's when I spotted a symbol on my minimap. It was the familiar blue symbol of a downed player. I quickly exited the swamp and made my way to it.

As I neared it, and it didn't give me an option to revive. I couldn't really make out the features, but something wasn't right. The character's animation was twitchy, and it kept flashing. I tried looking for anything I could do with it, then where the revive option would be changed to ""bury"".

I had never seen this option before, but every time I tried it gave me the same game message in my chat panel: ""Pinhehk dra fayg ihtan dra taydr pamm vmufan.""

Still not knowing what it meant, I ran toward it, trailing it and arriving in an area I had never been before. 

Hopelessly lost, and there were no markers for Asura Gates or anything on my minimap. Not even Vista markers or Point of Interest markers. Just a map, and the arrow that indicated the placement of my character.

I took this moment to take in my surroundings. It was a large forest, desperate to find my way out.

Keep in mind that so far I have stuck to areas I know. This place

At the end

???: You know what to do.

For some reason

Almost instantly, sprung forth from the deathbells. It was like the Shadow Behemoth, only it was engulfed in flame. My health was slowly draining, but my instincts were to fight it. 

No matter how many times I tried to attack, and went down. There was no way I was going to rally. My health was draining too fast. 

As the last percentage of my health drained, kneeling beside me. I couldn't waypoint. My character was dead. 

In the chat box

Then the character did something, whose face turned toward it, and there was an eerie, evil smile on its face before the screen went black for a moment and then exited to my desktop.

I tried to relaunch the game

I uninstalled it and stepped away from the computer. I didn't know what to do

I don't know what possessed me to do it, game, and statue. Everything. I refused to play it anymore.

I tried to tell my friends about it

I never want to play the game again. That much is certain.

They exist in the gaps. Those crevices and holes and nooks that light never gets to. They've always existed there. Before man their worlds were the deep caves, death, anti-life maybe is better. Things that despise light and life and air. Because of us, there are so many now. So many new places to hide.

That space in the corner of your room between the wall and the dresser. Behind the crack in the foundation in your basement. All the dark places that we've created.

That gap between the elevator door and your floor that we look at but immediately look away from and block out of our mind. You think to yourself, don't you? You never do it because your brain knows and doesn't want to see. 

One day maybe you're like me. I'm an athiest. I don't believe in those things. Maybe religion, evil, you know? And that's ok because Heaven is where I'm going. I think Heaven is a place with no dark places. I want to believe in it now. But I don't think it works when you know. Faith is faith because you don't know.

And you smell, acidic bile. You hear the slimy tentacles rubbing over the rotting leather and the clicking legs of rigid exoskeletons. You see...

Oh god you see.

And then you never stop seeing....or smelling...or hearing...

At the back of your sock drawer a purple spider leg disappears beneath the folded cotton lumps when you open it. That smell drifts out from under your bathroom sink while you listen to something that sounds like a scaly walrus trying to come through the hole in the bottom of your toilet. 

The yellow eye with two blood red pupils looks back at you from behind the grate over the vent in your living room.

And then you wake up one night in a panic and flip the light switch on because you feel a cold rope wrapping around and around your chest...and you taste death in your mouth. And suddenly you have faith. You believe with all your heart that one day soon your going to stand too close to a cracked door to an empty room, and the real pain begins.

1360713027.0,18er4x,Missing: Last Posts,Dergono,26,5,5,"Before we begin

 A few years back, in the 2007-2010 timespan.  In that time, many of the members were using the forum to post their work.  One of the better-written stories, titled Missing: Last Posts, was posted about a month before the site went down, and was never posted to the main site, because of the site's owner going through some issues which lead to the forums being shut down.  

The end result was that all the work posted there was lost, sadly - either because the owner didn't think it was good enough or because she didn't get around to it before the forums went down.  One way or another, the story was lost, and after remembering it recently, I wanted to share it with the internet again.  This was a problem, given that the story in question no longer existed, so I decided to recreate the story to the best of my ability.  I hope I haven't done too shabby of a job at spooking your bones



On April 4th, and initially, it was believed that Sam had run away from home.  The doors were all securely locked.  No windows had been broken.  The family dogs were undisturbed and unharmed.  In the absence of any evidence, the case was going nowhere.

 After no further developments in the case for almost a month

However, which was passed on to the Police by Mrs and Mr. Higgs.  In it, Sam's friend explained that he had come across several posts Sam had made on a forum he frequented, with the first being posted several hours before Sam's parents returned home to find him missing.  The posts were in a thread titled ""What scares you?"" 

In response to a post about dolls

""lol i know wat u mean.... i am currently home alone on my parents farm and its creepy here! :(  it is always creepy at night

About an hour passed.  During this time, until one user, FireRings221, asked him to describe the scarecrow after noticing his first post, to which Sam replied,

""well its kinda tall i guess

In response, ""ohnoooo!  yeah it is very scary! im glad im inside.  silly scarecrow, u cant get me, ur stuck at the driveway!  

hahah thats funny i thought it was facing the fields.""

Half an hour passed before Sam posted again.  His next post read:

""okay guys im actually kind of creeped out right now!!! the scarecrow is closer to my window i think

Sam's next post seemed to be typed far more quickly than the others had been.  ""ok guys just a update on the evil scarecrow it was really starting to freak me out.  im sure it was at the head of the driveway but now it is on 

the side of it, in response to others in the thread as normal, before falling silent for almost an entire hour.  Sam then uploaded his third-from-last post, which read ""ok something is rlly wrong here, i went to the living room to get a drink becaus the scarecrow didnt move but when i came back it was at the window, right up against it, i dont know what 2 do, nd i cant find the dogs.  i am going to my room""

Four minutes passed.  

Sam uploaded his second final post.  ""the scarecrow is in the livingroom""

Another two minutes passed. 

Sam uploaded his final post.

""its ifnfr of m i cnt blink icnt lk at the scren its in thr oom pls clal the police my adress is 1800 whetn rd pls hry""


Sam's account does not show any further activity whatsoever after this post.

In the wake of this discovery, however, include why there were no signs of forced entry to the residence, why the dogs were not disturbed by the intruder, and why Sam described the scarecrow as being in the house with him in his last posts.  Police have since suspected that the culprit may be someone the family knows, who has access to the house keys; however, Mr and Mrs. Higgs have stated that no one but Sam and themselves possessed a copy of the key.

The funny thing about it is that when I would hold my hand up the cracks in the drywall it felt extremely cold. I knew that there was a janitorial closet on the next aisle over. I just figured that there was an air conditioning unit behind the wall.

In my junior year I got involved in a student employment program. I helped the janitor with certain tasks early in the morning before school started. I was given a key to the janitorial closet. The first time I was in the closet I was being observed by the school janitor. I was was very anxious to see what was on the other side of that false door

The next day I was allowed to do my work without observation. When I in the process of grabbing the dry mop early that morning I eagerly ""cleaned out the empty boxes from the closet.

Jake was allergic to cats and preferred to keep his bedroom door closed but whenever her cries became unbearable to listen to

Jake opened a can of cat food, he changed her water, cleaned out her litter box and headed off to work.

He approached the door and opened it… 

... just a crack… 

... and retreated to his bed with grim anticipation.

For a small eternity

And then the door creaked open… 

… and a pair of nocturnal eyes glowed through the darkness... 

... much larger than the ones he was accustomed to seeing...

The familiar purring sound was replaced with something that sounded more like growling.

The cat had brought something back with it… from whatever unknowable dimension it had visited.

 I was always naturally a curious kid. I had stopped snooping in about 5th grade when I found out my mom was cheating on my dad. But I was 16 now. I could handle whatever was in that house. I mean, depending on how long the house had been empty. I turned the knob, and it was unlocked. But when I opened the door, it felt like someone had pulled it from the other side. I instantly got the bad kind of butterflies in my stomach. I kept telling myself to walk away. That the door had obviously been pulled open by something. Yet, I walked in anyway. 
""Hello?!"" I called out. 
""Did someone pull the door open?"" Nothing. 
Okay, but it wouldn't budge. I pulled and pulled with all the strength I could muster. However, being a 16 year old girl who didn't play any sports, I wasn't particularly strong. The door wouldn't move. I called my best friend, Tom. He told me I needed to just go home and forget about the house, but after I begged he came over. While I was waiting for him to get to the house, I explored the upstairs part of the house. There were five bedrooms. One was obviously the parents room, and one looked like a teenage boys room. The fifth one, collecting myself
""Tom? Is that you?"" No answer. I thought he was just messing with me. ""Tom
""It's me Jess! Please get down here now!"" He sounded scared
 I ran downstairs, staring into it. 
""Tom....what it is?""
 ""I told you to go home."" He sounded different.

 ""I told you not to come here."" 
He was making me really nervous. He kept staring at me
""Tom! What the hell is wrong with you?!"" I screamed
I heard him walk away. I tried to get my eyes to adjust but it was too dark. Then I felt something. Someone was touching me. Running their fingers up and down my arms. Playing with my hair. 
""Who is in here?"" I cried in a desperate hope that this was all a prank. 
No one answered me. Then, hoping it would be the normal him that picked up. 
""Hey Jess! Sorry I'm not there yet

""Oh my god... who is it?"" Tom asked. 
""We haven't been able to identify her yet

""That's Jess. My best friend. That's her."" He cried. 
Then my heart dropped. I was dead. Someone killed me. I couldn't remember anything. Just going into the closet.. The phone dropped from my ear
""Jess! Are you there Jess?!?! Answer me
I looked around at the barren neighborhood and then collapsed. I was actually dead. This wasn't a bad dream. My heart has officially stopped. I looked up, and there was a dark figure standing in the doorway of the house. I couldn't make out a face, but it nodded at me, and turned away, walking back into the house.

It's playing with me. Trying to break me. But I won't be broken so easily. I can't let it win. I still don't know what it wants and I suppose I will never figure out before my time is up. Then again

For as long as I can remember, but hadn't escalated to anything more until two weeks ago.

I had just gotten off of the phone with a friend of mine after having a long conversation about the newest Soul Caliber game. I plugged in my phone to let it charge over night and headed to my bed. I'm used to that sensation of something behind me, and ignore those feelings. I was tired of turning my head to look over my shoulder every two minutes to see an empty room. It knew I was thinking this and wasn't about to let our little game end so easily. Not when it's had such fun terrifying me at night.

I laid down in bed and turned to face the wall. Not even five seconds later, my eyes glancing over at the spot of the wall where the shadow ran constantly, though it never returned. But it wasn't done with me for the night. Shuffling came from the other side of the basement. Once again, I bolted upright to find the source of the noise but was met by the sight of a dark corner filled with all of our junk, as we had just recently moved in. I tried my best to ignore it, as I was feeling rather tired. Hopefully if I closed my eyes, I would fall asleep quickly and the night would be over.

That's when I felt it. I can't describe it as a finger or anything else specific, wait. There's something else. Is that... a voice? A quiet and deep mumbling voice became just barely audible over the white noise of my fan. I jumped out of bed and ran to the fan, turning it off and standing motionless. From upstairs, I heard the TV. My mother had left it on. But the voices coming from the TV didn't match what I had heard. I tried to brush it off as a simple trick caused by the fan and turned it back on, returning to my bed to attempt to sleep again, but the voice came back, this time in a hissing whisper. I couldn't make out a single word it said

Finally, A few friends sat around me, but I can't remember who they were. At the same time, all of them got up. They all needed to do something in my house, such as use the bathroom, get a glass of water, ect. They ascended the stairs and I stood at the bottom, awaiting my friends' return, I could pinpoint the source of the pounding: My neighbor's condo. 

I charged up the stairs and ran outside, as if silenced by some external force. I stood in the doorway, peering into the house. I called for them, but no one responded. That sense of loneliness came over me again, but was quickly replaced by something new. Something was in this building. Something that wanted me. It was calling for me in silence and I was compelled to comply. Those impossiby long outstretched arms. That featureless face. It wants me and I have no choice but to comply as it tries to pull me into the shadows.

I bolted up from my bed in a cold sweat, things haven't been the same. I've constantly had that overwhelming sense of being entirely alone that I had in the dream, even when sitting next to a friend. Though layered under that feeling, I can feel it watching me. I've seen it a couple times. Peering at me from behind trees while walking late at night, staring at me through the windows of every home down the street, waiting in the darkest corner of my basement, and of course, it gets closer and closer to me. 

Those long arms outstretched, but then it lets me know that everything will be ok if I go with it. No one will miss me, it tells me. Even now, it stands behind me, watching over my shoulder as I write my final words so that people may know where I've gone. Its arms outstretched, ready to embrace me. I welcome the embrace, for I am finally home.

I awoke to an uncertain sound, but it sounded wounded and familiar. I opened my eyes and tried to move, but my whole body was paralyzed. Staring straight up at the ceiling I saw the face of my best friend staring down at me, weeping and sobbing uncontrollably as soon as I looked him in the eyes. 

Suddenly all around him were the faces of my friends and loved ones all coming into view, turning my rooms floor into a shallow pool. Then one by one all the faces in the ceiling started drooping down, the ceiling literally birthing them all, their sickly pale white bodies splashing in the waters below them.

Slowly they all stand up and start screaming my name in a high pitched chant, necks snapping and cracking with ever turn and twist. They all converge at me, pulling at my sheets, my clothes and lastly my skin. Unable to move I felt them pull off my skin, my blood spurting and splashing on heir bodies and the walls. The room starts shaking and they all pick me up and offer me up to the ceiling. The only thing I can muster is a shriek and the words ""THIS IS ALL JUST A BAD DREAM""

I begin rising up toward the ceiling, and its me. My eyes are black, my mouth hanging open with a hallow chanting booming around the room. I float closer to my mouth as my tongue comes down and wraps around me. The last thing I feel is my body being encased and carried into the gaping hole that was my own mouth, consuming me whole. 

After what seems like an eternity in my mind I open my eyes and find I'm floating on the top of my pool. I thrash about and climb out of the water

I found this pad of paper and feather quill next to the bed I woke up. I snatched it up, I don't know a broken down city. That's best way to describe it because.... that's where I am. It's a huge broken down city. As far as I can see there are buildings that are broken down, crumbled and shattered.

It was about then that I realize, ya know, coffee and maybe a doughnut but not today. I woke up in a damn broken down necropolis. That's a good word for whatever this is, a necropolis. There weren't even birds around. Keeping my wits... barely, I went for my coat but realized it's a cool comfortable summer day. When I crashed out it was snowing.

Anyway

I explored a bit. There's literally nothing here but death....well no, what three I think.

A neon light above some ruined building sputtered for a good ten seconds and died. There was no label on the place so I looked inside to see a table with some chairs sitting around it and on the north side... wait, I'll ch*e*ck it out tomorrow.

The lamp that was on before was now off, and deciding whether or not to get up to go to the bathroom, I found that the voices were back. It was still whispers, but the whispers were louder, as if they were closer. I decided to get up, to escape the voices. However, to my shock and horror, both dizzy and petrified. I sat down on the toilet because I was too dizzy to pee standing up. The lights flickered a bit. Then everything went black. Lightning almost instantly struck! I quickly got out of there and knocked on my parents door. No answer. I tried opening the door. It was surprisingly unlocked. Their room was pitch black. I quickly got out my phone to use as a flashlight to find them dead in their bed. The Queen size bed covered in blood. I nearly puked in horror. The voices now louder than ever. I saw something on the wall and turned to it. In blood were the words ""you're next."" The voices seemed to break out into laughter. I sat there petrified for what seemed like forever.

I awoke violently, the only detail my eyes strained to make out of the darkness around me.

A wisp of smoke crept up the screen from the ashtray and over the top out of view. My vision followed the trail from the source up the screen and in my periphery a scattering of ocular detritus followed in its wake. These were the 'Muscae Volitantes', remaining just visible enough to distract me from my work.

I winced, much more this time, almost dominating my vision in the left eye. It was almost glowing with an intense blackness as I concentrated on it. Somehow it was... beautiful... like closed eye visuals one might experience on LSD, there were endlessly evolving, adjusting shapes, fleeting in and out of existence. Once more I rubbed the eye and opened it again to find it occupying an entire side of my field of vision. Finding myself mesmerised and distracted by the infinite random details I wandered slowly across the apartment, holding the afflicted eye closed. The bathroom flashed into existence with the click of a light switch and I positioned myself in front of the mirror. Gazing into my reflection I slowly opened my left eye once more and was presented with a scene utterly unlike anything I'd ever cared to imagine.

The typical appearance of the bathroom was anything but that; a mass of wispy, it appeared more profound and my vision in the other eye seemed to be affected now, too.

Finding it hard to distinguish between the architecture of the apartment and the swirling apparitions which were enveloping me I eventually stumbled onto the bed

Feeling that if I had given myself up, I followed the path the killer would come through to find me at the hotel, hoping that even if I did die, innocent lives coud be spared. I made a crudely-drawn map detailing the city streets, buildings, and the killers path, deciding where I would confront him.

I looked at my map, convinced that his pattern of killings directed towards me were merely coincidence and had nothing to do with me.

As I return to the hotel, feeling confident that his target was never me, and it was just some psycho who didn't know where he would kill next any more than the police thought he would.

When I was younger, threw Cheerios all over the kitchen, left, and was never seen again.

So

To get to our bathroom you had to walk down a long door-less hallway. Well

We pointed the friend to the bathroom, helped her to the bathroom. They returned without incident.

Then my younger sister piped up. She had to use the bathroom but she didn't want to go alone. I was older than her but I was also terrified

I still remember her scream as she came running out of the hallway. It was so bad that I swore I would never chicken out like that again.

I only know what she's told me

Here's what she said happened:

Our bathroom was pretty large.There was a large walk in closet, unless you were standing or you looked up while sitting on the toilet.

She made it into the bathroom without incident and had sat down to do her business when she decided to look up. There in the window was a mans face looking down at her with a horribly wide grin. His hand was held up in a fist at his chin and between each finger was a knife.

That's when she screamed and ran.

Now

But that's not the creepiest part. The part that really chilled me was that she knew who it was. It was that guy who had helped my mother so many years ago. The guy that we later found out had died only a few months after he'd left us.

For those of you who have an Xbox 360, the selection isn't very good. There are a few diamonds in the rough though and they stand out from the competition pretty well. CastleMiner Z is one of those. I have loved the game ever since my friend Ben told me about it. 

One day after getting home from tennis, and play some CastleMiner Z. I booted it up from the My Games section and I got the typical update screen. Although I was feeling impatient, I decided to click yes and was brought back to the home screen with a new Active Download. I checked out his big the download was and since my download speed is terrible, it was looking like it was going to take a while. 

The update finished and I started the game up to find that I had lost Creative Mode and all of my worlds that I had. Feeling a bit down, the typical message box popped up, reading a message that said, 

""Congratulations! You have unlocked Playground Mode!"" 

I had never heard of this Playground Mode

The first thing in noticed when playing was that the little toolbar at the bottom was dark red instead of the usual black. Thinking it was just a restyling, I went into my inventory to make one. There was a new description on it that said 

""Used to dig the Green Grave."" 

Now at this point, but I figured it was a new side quest.

After collecting some materials

""Dig all the graves for a surprise!"" 

It was in the spot where Creative usually was and I figured they scrapped Creative and that's why I lost all my worlds. I went back onto my map

I went looking around the world for a graveyard. Since the map was split into multiple little areas, ""Sally Soil"" which I thought was a really odd name. After walking about 15 blocks in, an eerie fog set in, and the music that normally played next to the tower at the spawn sounded inverted, and the actual soundtrack itself contained the cries of the multiple mobs in the game, instead of there being mobs in the area. 

After walking for about a minute in the fog, black, green, orange, yellow, blue. It clicked in my head that it meant the different types of shovels, which were stone, iron, which didn't have a description and floated around when I held it. 

On the Black Grave, said ""Sally"" and nothing else. 

I took out my copper shovel and repeated all the previous steps on the Green Grave. I picked up the Green Skull and and a new sign appeared that said ""swings"" and nothing else. 

Not having an iron shovel

A few hours later

On the Orange Grave

On the Yellow Grave

On the Blue Grave

""Sally swings on Hell's Playground."" 

At this point, so I saved and quit to check out to see if the map had been renamed. It had.

""Skulls Are Heavy""

I figured this to be a hint of what to do with the skulls. I went back into the map and traveled all the way to Hell.

In Hell, the more the skulls were shaking. I held nothing for a while because I didn't see any mobs that I needed to fight. 

Soon, it would play slowed down for 5 seconds and sped up for five seconds, which was even creepier than the graveyard theme. After many minutes of walking, I reached a very bad looking swingset made out of bloodstone blocks. It was about 5 blocks high and had fine different swing out different colors.

I took out the skulls and they didn't make my controller vibrate anymore. I tried placing down the Black Skull on the Black Swing and it was successful. Nothing specifically happened for doing so. I repeated the step for each swing and after the Blue Swing the swingset just burst into Bloodstone blocks. In the rubble

A Bloodstone Knife.

And a Bloodstone Shovel. 

The knife had a description that said in all caps ""KILL HER""

When I teleported back

""A New Grave Awaits.""

When I went back into the game

""Sally wants to get revenge.""

I noticed that behind the graves there was a new grave that had popped up. It was made out of Bloodstone

Another mob jumped out of ground and this time it went much faster than the other mobs. It's hair was flying all over the place and would not die from the Bloodstone Shovel. I tried the knife and it worked like a charm. Instead of dropping a red skull

""You have made a mistake. Sally is not dead. Sally wants to play a game.""

I walked back to the 5 graves to see if I got a new message.

I did. It said

""Why don't you turn around?""

I turned around and there was another grave. I put Sally's Head in front of the grave. A message appeared on the screen. 

""I want to have some fun. Let's play hide and seek. Pick a grave. Any grave.""

I turned around to see the message on the graves had changed. It now read

""Sally's favorite color is red.""

I took the Bloodstone Shovel out and dug another block down the Red Grave. Instead of something popping up

After an unusually long boot up

""Sally's Favorite Color Is Red""

It spawned me next to the tower and everything seemed to be back to normal. My inventory was empty. There was no red toolbar. Thee was no fog or eerie music or Sally Soil. 

I decided to do a little research and found out there was no update for CastleMiner Z and that nobody else had encountered this. Every time I boot up that world

The door bursts open and cracks against his skull.

The Mother emerges.  Startled to see him here.

He smiles awkwardly at her, pulling a fresh pack of her own out of her purse.  He lets out a nervous laugh.

“Thought you were going to bust me

“I’ve quit, keeping her distance from him.  “It’s just been a trying day.”

“If you don’t mind me asking...”

She looks at him.  After a moment of consideration: “Ex-husband.  I don’t mean to be rude

“Say no more.  Maybe you could help me figure something out.  There’s this stain on the wall here...”

The walls of the stairwell look like they’ve been painted over dozens of times.  Mostly touch-ups.  Ghosts of graffiti tags bleeding through the off-white paint.  The surveillance camera fixes on the spot that the Businessman gestures toward:  a faint

“... it looks like a partial-handprint to me.  You can make out a thumb and a forefinger.  I don’t want to say it looks like dry blood but I also can’t escape that feeling.  I’m sure there’s a far more mundane explanation.  What do you think...?”

She looks at the stain.  Disturbed.  Stubs out her smoke.  “I should go.”

“Wait.  Please.  Listen.  I’m trapped in the middle of this never-ending business trip.  Let me buy you a drink.  No offense but you look like you could use a drink.

Little empty booze bottles surround the Older Flight Attendant and the Captain as they tear through the contents of the mini bar

The Captain catches his breath.  Reaches for his jacket which has fallen on the floor.

“You really want to know what happened up there

“Have I had enough shots to earn the truth?”

“I don’t know but I’m drunk enough to share.  Ready to see something scary?”

He fishes a flip cam out of his jacket.  Fumbles with the controls for a moment.  The surveillance camera zooms in toward the device and the room-feed freezes--

Flip cam footage suddenly takes us into a commercial airline cockpit.  30, but it doesn’t look or move like a common aircraft.  The Captain’s voice, from behind the cam: “What in the hell is that...?”  Without warning, a bird slams into the windshield just as the entire sky whites out – the flip cam footage breaks into digital static...

The Captain and Flight Attendant sit together on his hotel bed

“All the controls froze for a good minute or two.  I was sure we were fixed on a collision path.”

“With what...?”

“Twenty years

“Did you report it?”

“I’d rather report I was drinking.  You don’t report this kind of thing if you want to keep flying.  It’s a career ender.”

No water at the faucet

She squints through the sting of soap

A sad smile crosses her face at the offer.  It is a smile that he recognizes as the precursor to a rejection.  He stops her before she can respond: “Don’t say anything.  You don’t have to say anything just yet.  Let me explain how much sense this makes...”

A sound suddenly rises up outside.  Like an airplane landing... but there’s something off about it.  Too much bass.  Strange mechanical rhythms.  The ground trembles.  White light begins to flood in through the windows.

The Mother seems to recognize the light and sound.  She runs off without explanation.  The Businessman runs after her.

Elsewhere.  The camera is zoomed in on The Watcher as he follows the path of the Mother and the Businessman running back to her room

The camera slowly zooms out to reveal the massive bank of monitors spread before him.  Spanning the walls.  Rising to the ceiling.  Dominating this small chamber.  Far more surveillance feeds than would be practical for covering the security of a modest airport hotel.

The Watcher manipulates his controls.  Throughout the hotel

The Older Flight Attendant and the Captain burst into the adjacent room:

The Younger Flight Attendant has vanished.

They run down the hallways

The Mother and the Businessman race down the hallway from the elevator bank.  The Older Flight Attendant rushes to them.

“Have you seen my friend

The Mother frantically pushes past them

The Daughter has vanished.

She checks the closets.  Bathroom.  Empty.  No sign of the dog

“Becky!?”

The Businessman tries to calm her down.  “She can’t be very far.  You think your ex found you?”  He tries to use his cell phone: it’s dead.

“What?”

He approaches the hotel landline.  “Your ex-husband.  Becky’s father.  You told me you were running from him.”

“I wasn’t entirely truthful with you earlier

He clicks the landline a few times: no dial tone.  “Who’s been pursuing you?”

“I don’t know... but it’s here.”

“What do you mean by ‘it’...?”

All the lights throughout the hotel suddenly go out.

Surveillance cameras switch to night-vision as everyone begins to panic.

It was this question that prompted the great philosopher Ephialtes to build the Living City. An unparalleled architect, Ephialtes agreed terms with the Kings of Orr, being granted ten thousand slaves, ten dozen spellbinders, and complete control of Orr's prestigious white granite quarries, from which  he would fashion his masterpiece.

The planning lasted five years; the construction fifty. Ephialtes himself blessed the final stone

The Living City was a marvel, even in the harshest winter, providing a never-ending supply of heavenly fruits. So contended were the people of the City that not one thought to ask the most obvious question. How was it all possible?

Across the world crops, until exotic strangers began appearing in the streets, lost and confused. The city was no longer providing for the people; it was providing for itself. As rumour took wing across land and sea rival countries mustered their armies to march against Orr. They tore through the beleaguered nation until at last they surrounded the cursed Living City. They slept, and they dreamed of ruin.

Dawn broke across an empty plain. Nothing remained of the Living City, not even the roads remains. The place had vanished, never to be seen again.

You might ask how I know all of this, the storehouses dust. Only bones remains for those who lived here, and beyond the walls a maddening darkness reclines to the horizon like the death-stare of God. Every few weeks someone new stumbles into the streets, and naturally they turn to me for answers. Soon enough, they make the mistake of trusting me. The meat lasts a good while, even raw, but there's never enough to fill the void. The hunger never ends. For either of us.

I sometimes wonder whether the City is trying to feed me or itself. After all, or the citizen the city? I'm still not sure of the answer.

Perhaps we should discuss it sometime.

1357985461.0,16fkbj,A weird police report from 1992,sharp7,28,9,9,"Heres a weird report someone wrote at a police station I found on a message board once and saved. Its from a guy named Henry Horton in 1992 in some small town in Nebraska: 

----------------------------------------------------

Henry Horton
2 Maple Ave
Norfolk NE 68701

Catagory: Stalking

I'm a secretary at a typical office job. Every day I come into work I usually have to make a lot of photo copies. We got this fancy copy machine that pretty much does my work for me

The man is pretty far off
One day I was having a particularly bad day. My BF broke up with me, it felt like my life was meaningless. When I looked out at the window at the strange man in yellow, he slowly started turning his head until it seemed like he looked right at me. He was too far to be sure, but it scared me so I backed away from the window and got some water.
The next day I looked out the window again, as were two other shops nearby. I thought the economy must be taking its toll. My eyes wondered a little more until I noticed the man in yellow was staring right at me again. This time I didn't back away right away, instead I tried to figure out if the angle of his gaze really was right at me. I looked at the area near me doing instinctual size and angle estimates and I realized, there is no way he wasn't staring right at me. 
The next day I told my coworker about it. She seemed skeptical. When she looked out the window, at least I wasn't hallucinating. She said he was just staring ahead though. When I walked up to the window and looked out I saw that she was right, but then he slowly turned his head until his eyes once again could be gazing at nothing other than me. How could he even see my slightly exposed face through the blinds? There should be a large amount of glare too. This is impossible I thought, and my coworker said that maybe its just a coincidence. I thought I could test this, what if I try this a few times, no way its just a coincidence if he looks at me every time, but I was too scared. Instead I wanted to believe that it was just a coincidence and left. 

That night I was feeling somewhat lonely so I called a friend over. When I thought I heard her car door I checked out through my first story window. It was hard to see through the glare so I put my hands around my eyes against the window to block out the light. I still couldn't see much, and to my relief it really was them. They searched the area and found nothing but some foot prints. I told them I saw this man through the window at work and they assumed it must be a stalker and I should try to figure out who it is.

For a month after that I was just too scared to ever look out a window and I stayed over at relatives and friends houses as much as I could. Eventually though I had to muster up the courage and get over this. So one day I decided to look out my office window again. At first I avoided looking at the area the man in yellow would typically stand. I noticed even more ""For Sale"" signs on local shops, all looking solemn though. Maybe its over I thought. Until I noticed one of them in the back, I could only see his shoulder but it seemed to be yellow. I also noticed they all started to look around, at first in random directions, until eventually one of them started staring at me. I wanted to cry but I was too afraid to move. One by one they all started to look at me. Why me, I thought. Why me of all people, this sad lonely wimpy guy. Then I thought

After that I made sure to sleep in my parents house. I was thankful for the first time in my life that they lived near by. Well not that near by, and having one in the house that night made me feel better. Still, I couldn't sleep. The night though was quite, nothing but typical sounds of winds and the occasional car wushing by. I thought what would I do in the long run though. I can't sleep here all the time. Maybe I'll just get my own gun or borrow my parents for a little while. I don't really know how to use it though, but maybe I could learn. I decided that night I was definitely going to a shooting range and learn how to defend my self. The thought gave me just enough courage to become sleepy. I just needed one final reassurance so I looked out the window. I sighed with relief as I noticed no one there. I did see a man a little far off though and I watched him walk down the street. He wasn't wearing yellow, and he passed the house. But then he looked back, right at me. 

I started gasping for air, and we were relieved but no one ever made an attempt to enter the house. Hours and hours we stayed in that room scared out of our minds. Eventually the sun rose, and after a few more hours we finally looked out the window.
No one was there but there were hundreds and hundreds of footprints everywhere. We then went to the police station

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I heard he went missing a little after this report was filed. So did a few other people with a similar story. There wasn't a pattern in the people who went missing so the trail went cold fast and eventually it stopped happening so the cases were dropped. It was kind of awhile ago so I can't find any more info at least on the internet. ",self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/16fkbj/a_weird_police_report_from_1992/

During my early teen years

The property we rented was fantastic. It consisted of a hidden driveway, and you could tell that the owner had taken much pride in it. 

There was one place of the yard that stood out though. An eyesore of a garage that unlike the rest of the property, so we just parked our car outside. If we wanted to get in, there was a smaller, normal sized door beside the larger one.

We were told that the interior was supposed to have electricity, it was just a pile of dirt. At one point it may have been cement, but it had heavily degraded since then.

There were a few tables messily thrown around the perimeter of the inside, and stuff like that.

If you went around to the back of the garage, in fact, it was padlocked and she had kept the key. 

She had good reason to keep us out, and had become completely rotten. The paint was so chipped that you could barely tell its colour; you could just see the old blackened boards that were once painted over. The roof had long since collapsed, and we could only assume the floor had as well, as it appeared to only be held up by a few cement bricks.

I had always curious about that building.


We had lived there for close to a year before we were told that the owner, she had only mentioned us, as we were the only people she knew from around here, even though the only contact we had with her was when we mailed the rent. We had never spoken face to face since the day we had moved in.

She had left the house to us to own. There was no funeral date, and we were pretty happy.

After that day, with whom she was very happy with. We managed to get our financial situation under control, and we planned on moving out of our current home and purchasing a house with my mother’s boyfriend closer to town. 

I had just finished packing up my room, so I was very rushed.
I carried the bags downstairs and took them outside to put them beside the road. While I was returning to the front door

But then there was a bang, well, my yard was extremely private, and the only doors nearby that I would be able to hear slam were that of my own.

Looking around my yard I didn’t see anything suspicious. But then I heard the creaking again, and then a bang.  “Alright, the wind had just blown the door open.” I assured myself. 

I went over to the small rotting shed, and started to push it closed, but something caught my eye. There was clearly something shiny on the far side of the shed. I wanted to know what it was, but I remembered the warnings from the owner, one single step inside could cause the whole structure to collapse on top of me.

I guess I was feeling particularly reckless that day, which made it even harder to keep my balance, as it was quite slippery. I slowly tiptoed over to the other side, making sure that I didn’t trip and go through the disgusting floor.

Once I reached the other side, I remembered, was the maiden of the deceased owner of the house. I quickly pieced it together and came to the conclusion that the ring was a Family Ring.
I fiddled around with the ring in between my fingers for a minute, seemed to be a…hand.

I inched closer, the remains of one. Rotten flesh, stretched over the yellowing bones of a human hand. And that’s all it was, just the hand, mummified and broken off from the rest of the body.

My eyes clouded over, as my feet cracked the floor beneath me, and I fell face first. When my face touched the floor, I immediately figured out where the smell was coming from. The floor was smeared with dried out feces. 

When I had looked up, and hanging off the side of it, was a mummified body. The skin was peeling off to reveal the broken bones that were inside. It would’ve been impossible for me to forget this image. The bones of what was once a living, breathing person, had been twisted and distorted, snapped and shattered.  I could see the person’s organs, shrunken, dangling inside of the ribcage. The body’s left hand looked as if it had been crushed

The wall beside this body looked as if someone had attempted to smash it

There was the outline of what was once a window, sure enough, close by laid the final corpse. This one looked newer. It hadn’t quite mummified yet, and there was still some skin on the body. My guess would have been it was just a little over a year old. But it was missing its eyes. They had been clawed out, and the blood from this was still visible on the floor. Near its hand, laid yet another identical ring.

I was brought out of my trance by the slow sound of creaking, and the only person capable of unlocking it, was the owner.

I heard everything

My nose had a little bit of bone sticking out at the middle, I proceeded to file off the rest of the way down to my bone.  I went too far and felt it.  That would never do!  The new indent caused another imperfection.  Since I couldn’t put bone back on, I just scraped the rest of my nose off, straight through until it lay in front of me, blood pooling around it.  I looked back up at the mirror.  My ears were a bit lopsided.

I cut off the section of my ear that was hanging down too far.  I cut it flat instead of rounded to have a new ear lobe.  A flat ear lobe?  Imperfect.  I cut off the rest of my ear.  Now my face was unsymmetrical.  To fix that minor imperfection

I was sweating, grunting as I swung my legs out over the edge of the bed and planted them on the floor. The darkness around me felt more welcoming than the prospect of returning to my hellish nightmares
“I am awake
I sat for a long time, dreading the thought of returning to that place of terror and darkness that no doubt awaited me in my dreams. Breathing deeply once more, I ran one hand through my hair, cool from the air-conditioning. I stood up slowly and shuffled to the bathroom, hoping to find relief in the bright, fluorescent lighting.
A stinging sensation filled my eyes, and I hadn’t shaved in days. My eyes were streaked with veins of red. I turned on the faucet and let it run, allowing the noise to fill the silent void of my empty apartment. Filling my hands with water, I splashed my face with cold liquid. With my eyes closed, I let the water drip off of my face.
As the water trickled off of my skin, just as my fingertips met its warm, glassy surface, another bulb went out. Staring intently at the second bulb, my breathing was fast and shallow.
“I’m awake
Then the screaming started. It came from somewhere in the shadows outside of my bathroom. I turned to face the wall of darkness that surrounded my small bubble of fading light, searching for any semblance of light. I prayed for spare light bulbs, a flashlight, anything. All I could pull from the recess of the cabinet was a box of matches. With shaking hands, I tried the first match. It snapped in half, as another light went out, and the terrible screaming grew louder. I was down to three lights over my mirror.
I tried another match, I never took my eyes away from the shadows outside my bathroom door. The shrieks filled my ears, invading my thoughts, and sucking the oxygen from my lungs. One light left.
“I’m dreaming
The screams were so deafening, and continued my attempts at light my match with trembling fingers, as the last light bulb began to flicker. Just as that last bulb sparked and went out, I got the match to light, and...everything was quiet. No screaming outside my door, no noises to drive me mad. Nothing made a sound except for my gasping breaths. Slowly I calmed down, slowing my breathing to a normal rate
“I am awake
“Me too
I woke up in my bed, no terrible presence or screaming shadows. Another deep breath, and I rose from my bed.
“They’re getting worse, letting the water run off of my face, I closed my eyes. My calm was returning to me in the light of day. I sighed with relief, breathing in the morning. I opened my eyes, and my breath caught in my chest. There next to the sink were two matches, one broken in half and the other burnt down almost completely.

I thought I would finally write about this since I no longer work at that place. I used to have a second job, sometimes as late as 2-3 AM. 

At first I never noticed anything. I would hear noises and thought it was just the heating system

At the beginning, so I was never able to successfully record it happening. 

One time, I was down there at the time replacing a computer that was ruined by a flood. I searched and found no one. That instance only happened once and I was relieved. What ended up truly freaking me out was the dark figure. 

At first, but you can see dark pupils that resembled eyes. I could feel it's piercing gaze upon me, and it gave me the shivers. From it's build, it looked like it was wearing a trench coat. 

I tried once to wave a flashlight at it, and only on the first floor. I took pictures with my iPhone, but the figure would never appear in them. It also didn't like me. I tried walking to it several times to get a closer look. One time it was in a office staring at me while I was replacing a hard drive in a computer at someone's desk. I started walking closer to it. I got within 6 feet, then the dark figure slammed the door shut in front of it. I opened the door and turned on the lights in the office. It was gone. This has happened a few times and has gotten to become more annoying than scary. It may have been just as annoyed at me as I was with it. 

I tried talking to the figure, dark, piercing stare. I never tried provoking it, I didn't think it would be the smartest thing to do. I worked in this condition for 7 years, until I was laid off from my job there at the end of June 2012. At last! I don't have to deal with that dark figure anymore. I was lucky it wasn't hostile towards me. I just hope the next guy is just as lucky.


Here's a picture of what best represents the dark figure:

To get us started

""In any city, ask to visit someone who calls himself “The Holder of the End”. Should a look of child-like fear come over the workers face, you will then be taken to a cell in the building. It will be in a deep hidden section of the building. All you will hear is the sound of someone talking to themselves echo the halls. It is in a language that you will not understand, but your very soul will feel unspeakable fear.

Should the talking stop at any time, flee. Leave, do not stop for anything, do not go home, don’t stay at an inn, just keep moving, sleep where your body drops. You will know in the morning if you’ve escaped successfully.

If the voice in the hall comes back after you utter those words continue on. Upon reaching the cell all you will see is a windowless room with a person in the corner

The person will then stare into your eyes and answer your question in horrifying detail. Many go mad in that very cell, and look upon the object in the person’s hands. You will want to as well. Be warned that if you do, your death will be one of cruelty and unrelenting horror.

Your death will be in that room

The words every father expects to hear. Invariably, I would respond, ""Almost, sweetie."" We had been driving for almost two hours (which should give you an idea of how much I'd had to put up with) to drop Cynthia off at her mother's. Lisa and I had been divorced for about three years, and doggedly, she still demanded to see Cynthia for a month every Christmas. Now, Lisa wasn't exactly Mother of the Year material, I smoke

Needless to say, what's that?!"" or ""Are we there yet?"" before replacing her round little face on the passenger-side window. And I would indulge her every question, explaining ""It's an old grain silo, sweetheart,"" or ""Almost, dear.""

After a while, meditative trance induced by long-distance driving. However, my calm was soon disturbed by a shriek from Cynthia. Slamming on the brakes instinctively, I brought the car to a lurching halt, looking over at Cynthia. ""What is it? Cynthia, what's wrong!?"" I asked, panicking. My mind raced with all the things that could go wrong—heart attack, kidney failure (all of which outlandish

As I looked past her small

It was an enormous white birch tree in the middle of a snowy field. Now, something else struck me as odd about the leaves of the tree. It was a good distance into the field (about thirty yards) and I was still looking from behind Cynthia's head (which was firmly plastered to the window at this point), but I could just barely make out the shape of the leaves themselves. It didn't even register at first, but after looking carefully, I realized that the leaves of the tree weren't leaves at all… they were…shoes. Hundreds of them. Hanging from the branches by the laces, every shape and size imaginable. I slowly opened the door and stepped out to get a closer look. The sheer size of the tree was impressive, and the spread of its branches was unbelievable. By a rough sizing-up, some from even the smallest branches. I began to walk around the front of the car, and Cynthia shot off toward the tree

Now, it was also the dead of winter. So as Cynthia ran off toward the tree, wearing just a pair of jeans and a t-shirt, my first reaction was to go get her coat (Lord knows she wouldn't put it on, even if it was fifty below). I turned around to grab her snow jacket from the car, and when I turned back, coat in hand
My eyes searched the snow frantically for her, and as the snow crunched underfoot, I heard her giggle again, unmistakable. ""Cynthia, come here right this instant!"" I shouted, my voice becoming slightly more hoarse. To my immense relief, she revealed herself, something I couldn't quite put my—

She was barefoot. ""Fine

I grabbed her by the shoulders, ""Cynthia, where are your shoes?""

Nervously, Daddy—look, he gave me a pretty necklace!""

My heart sank to the pit of my stomach. Sure enough, was a small heart-shaped pendant. I clenched my jaw, grabbed the pendant, and snapped it off.

""Daddy? What's wrong?""

""Cynthia

""But Daddy

""NOW, until I tell you so, okay?""

""Okay… if you say so…""

Cynthia walked off nervously towards the car, I wasn't about to allow him to go around luring little kids in with cheap baubles just so he could get his rocks off. I followed Cynthia's tracks straight toward the tree, until it loomed before me, larger than life. It was then that I noticed something about the shoes: they were all children's. Not a single pair larger than a kid's size 7. I shuddered and placed my hand on the tree for support.

To my shock, that wouldn't have been terribly unusual, were it not for the fact that right next to those initials were more. And next to those, even more. As I peeled back more and more of the thin, waxy bark, I discovered dozens of initials carved in, then hundreds. I took a step back. I began to get an uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach, wrenching knot that forms when you know something's wrong. I glanced back up at the shoes

Thoroughly creeped the fuck out at this point, cold air. I grabbed my key, unlocked the driver's-side door, got in, and locked it behind me. I turned to Cynthia and asked her, ""Are you okay sweetie? Did anyone hurt you, or touch you?""

""No, he makes me laugh. He's got a funny face!""

That knot in my stomach twisted and squeezed

Cynthia remained wordless as her eyes slid to the backseat. My heart froze solid as I slowly turned my gaze to follow hers. It lounged casually back there, protruded from underneath the rotting flesh of its fingers. Its ""funny face"" was a mass of decaying skin, stretched tight over its bleached white skull. The corners of its mouth had sloughed away, leaving only a sickening grimace permanently etched beneath its eyeless sockets. The grotesque smile widened, and it reached into a jar at its side, grasping a tiny piece of candy between its decrepit fingers.

""Care for a piece of candy?""

I stared, and began unwrapping it. The creature's eyeless gaze seemed to shift to meet my own horrified stare, its disgusting grin widening ever so slightly. I tried to scream, but curiously, found that I couldn't. Funny, I hadn't even noticed his other hand creeping up my neck. A creeping chill entered my veins as his icy talons clutched my throat. Warm blood spilled down my chest as my last breaths wheezed through the freshly torn hole in my neck. Cynthia looked at me curiously, suckling innocently on that piece of candy. Her voice echoed around me as I spiraled down into darkness.

Well

On this particular day, I felt uneasy playing this because I am slightly superstitious, but I just shook away the feeling. I like this song and won't pass up a chance to listen to it. I even sang along. Soon after, another Voltaire song played. This time it was ""God Thinks"" (a song about how people are self-righteous and put words into the mouth of God). Well, I had already played two songs about the devil so a song like this wouldn't do any harm either.

I got done shelving downstairs for the night and sent the empty book cart upstairs via the electric dumbwaiter. I shut off the basement light and let the door slowly shut on its own. I didn't expect the door to slam so loud, there was a blood-curdling scream of agony coming from the basement. It was so clear and so loud that I jumped back and my hands shot up to my chest to feel my pounding heart.

I froze there for a moment in the short hallway. The only light came from the red EXIT sign over the door right in front of me next to the stairs. From outside, I heard another scream. It was the same voice as the first (a woman's voice). It screamed, ""No! Please, no!!'"" It was so god damn loud and so god damn clear.

I have always scoffed at people who say that they heard a clear voice saying something typical of a ghost to say like ""Don't!"" or ""Help me!"" or ""Get out!"" I always thought that they just wanted attention for hearing a ghost. I'm not saying that it was a ghost I heard but I know it came from the basement. At first

Jack pinched his eyes shut and tried to focus on seeing through the mark behind him. He saw a beautiful naked woman shaving her legs in a shower room. Her firm breasts pressed up against her thigh as she leaned forward(wrong one) His laundry room. A box of tide detergent sat on the corner(wrong one). He saw the arm of the dark figure closest to the mailbox. Through the mark he could see better than his old eyes could. The blackness was more of a deep gray. He focused on the hand and could make out black sharp talons punctuated the end of his three unnaturally long fingers. The figures stopped together, but he fought the rising dinner in his gut with clenched teeth. He looked back and one of the figures was face to face with his new perspective. A giant eyeball dominated the center of the creatures face, stretching from ear to ear across a face that looked like bleached white leather. The only other feature was a grotesque mouth that snarled at the corners. The creature snarled, revealing rows of jagged, broken, yellowing, needlelike teeth. It raised on finger and forcefully jabbed it into the mark. 

Jack's head exploded with a new torrent of pain. He opened his eyes and saw an older white lady from above. She was entering her PIN into a bank ATM. (not this one). He blinked and saw his hands and legs beneath him. Another light, burst into nothingness. He turned his head and could make out the figures shift closer thirty yards to the edge of the pool of light. They didn't move like normal, they seemed to just...fade out of existence in one place, while reappearing in another. Always in the dark though. ""They hate the light."" Jack thought to himself. It made sense. He couldn't turn off the marks. He didn't think they could blink either. The light probably hurt them. 

Jack turned back and stumbled to his feet. He saw down the hallway of his apartment complex. His neighbor was walking his chocolate lab in from outside (NO). Inside his fish tank

He had found the wax pencil inside the old wooden jewelry box behind the wall of the 18th century colonial his company was remodeling. He remembered how there had been an eye on the outside of the box. He remembered how it felt rubbing his hands over the box, swearing that the simple lines that represented an eyeball seemed to be looking back at him. The only thing was was inside was the black wax pencil and a note carved into the lid. ""The eyes bring the watchers.""

Jack didn't understand it then. But months later, searching for something...him. Each time he saw them they were always in the dark, and moving closer and closer to where he was. 

Jack felt the damp grass beneath him as he tried to crawl away. A loud crunching noise startled him from above

Jack squeezed his eyes shut and saw the inside of Comp City. The overhead lights were off but several large screen televisions were still playing. This view became fuzzy and swirled into a new perspective. He realized that he was again looking into the face of a snarling creature.

1365898155.0,1caqyk,Removal,GLKnight,20,3,3,"The sound of machines in the hallway come to your ears as the medicinal haze lifts from your head. You came into the hospital for a necessary surgery, your limbs for the most part unresponsive. You try to look around the room they've placed you in

So, and try to fall asleep again.

Your eyes spring open with the creaking of the private room's window beyond the sheet that blocks your view. The inaudible silence breached by the moaning of the window pane as it slowly opens itself. Slowly you attempt a voice to call out ""Who's there? Hello? What's going on?"", it's quickly followed by sounds from midnight activity of the street your room faces. You breathe, deeply relieved at the possibility of a window that's in need of maintenance.

Then you hear a clicking sound coming from the floor.

Your eyes widen at the intruding sound below you. You uselessly struggle against your body, and settles as the clicking sounds come to a stop. Your eyes are rapt and facing ahead, wordlessly, and almost breathlessly waiting for a sign of movement or life to draw your fears. But the moment doesn't come. Second after laborious second, you stare, feeling the weight of the medication pulling you back down. Your heart begins to settle, as your eyelids slowly begin to float down, you let yourself fall asleep again.

The bottom of your foot tingles slightly, attempting to roll to your side, but are completely unable to will yourself to turn. You tighten your eyes, trying to ignore the tingling sensation coursing up and down your foot. The sensation of tingles running up and down your foot is great, but you try to resist. Up and down, up and down, up and... down? A repeating pattern dragging itself across your foot, but this state of ignorance draws you to awareness as you open your eyes and you look past your legs.

A diminutive creature, and is drawing it's other claw against the bottom. Its sickly yellow eyes intently drawn to yours, and smiling with gleaming intent, it slowly pokes and prods your heel, pushing with more and more intensity until you hear a slight popping sound, and then the withdrawing of it's claw as it brings the tip to his nose and sniffs deeply. It shakes it's head, refusing the smell, the thing places it's hands on the bed

Barely over 3 feet tall, and getting on hands and knees, begins to sniff repeatedly, moving himself over your body. You want to push it away, to get out of there, to get someone to help you, but your body has become a medicated prison. He hovers over your leg, until he stops above your knee. He gently moves the blankets aside, and deftly skewers you. You try to scream

You hear the pop as he draws his claw out, twice, and enticingly flits his tongue out to sample what's on his claw tip, only to shut his eyes, and enjoy the taste he has found. Acting quickly, he gets on hands and knees, leans over your knee, and begins to lap at your wound. Your mind begins to piece together what is happening. You

You hoarsely try to call for help, bulbous nose between, no hair whatsoever on its head, watching you attempt to cry out. You try and try to speak, to be more than an inaudible whisper over the sounds of machines and wandering people and gurneys, but you notice that the thing on your bed has begun to mimic you. To mock you. To mirror your helpless state, and pitiable attempts for help. You begin to open your mouth to try once more, by slapping your stomach

His smile grows wider

He caresses your gut, placing it at the hem of your gown, and quickly yanks down, slicing as it goes. He separates the pieces, gently scraping across your chest, spiraling around and around, like he's homing in. He crooks an eyebrow, and *POP*! Jabs into your chest. This time

Your breathing begins to quicken at the thought of all that pain coming back and hitting you at once, rolls his eyes back, and zooms in on your right arm. It rushes in, pulling itself tightly against your arm, cradling itself fully. You can actually feel his breath on your shoulder as he nuzzles it, mewling contentedly. He flicks his claw out dramatically, making sure it's directly in front of your face. Gently grabbing your chin, as he stares back at you deeply. He grins maniacally

He forcefully stabs his claw into your shoulder, and your reaction elicits an intense, orgasmic response from him. He knows you felt that, and begins a soft cackle as you feel him draw his claw across. The blood begins to pour from your wound, as he twists back and forth, making a widening wound where your arm meets it's socket. You feel his fingers begin to force themselves deeper, as he shoves his claw further in

The pain is immense, forcing the grievous opening further, surveying all that he has done to you. Your arm is limp, losing all sensation but the nerves in your arm coursing the pain along. He lifts your now useless arm, and begins to crudely saw his claw in the opening. He twists your hand, providing more exposure to your armpit, as the nerve cluster there works overtime at the sensation, and your arm leaves your sense of connection.

He works his way around the rest of your shoulder, seeing how much he must do to excise it entirely from your person. This crude surgery he has done has left an indescribable feeling of violation, but you can see his work is almost finished. Your tears stream down as he places one foot on your chest, grabs his meat with both arms, and begins to pull.

He digs in deep, pulling with his full weight, twisting back and forth.

He tugs

He jerks

He leans forward, and pulls with all his might. You hear the sound of torn cartilage, and see him fall back, his newly won meat in his hands. He wastes no time, smiles at you, almost seeming to offer a prayer for you, before he rolls on your bed

The pain seeps into your body, and you pass out.



The sound of a monitor by your bed greets you as you awaken. You roll your head, and attempt to sit up. She rushes to you, helping with comfort. She coaches you, saying you were in surgery, and that it was a success. You meekly ask her for some water for your throat, and that you need some time to come to grips with it. You ask how long the surgery was for, which she responds with four hours, until she rushes around to the other side to help you drink. You tell her you still have strength to hold a cup

You attempted to grab the cup with your right hand

You begin to scream, but your violent outburst forces her to cry out for help. More nurses and doctors rush to your bed attempting to restrain you. You hear one doctor ask you to calm down, because you have another surgery scheduled, and that this outburst will only make things worse. You feel the pinch of a hypodermic needle, as one of the nurses injects you with something. You continue to scream that this isn't right, this wasn't what you were in the hospital for.

The weight of the doctors and nurses becomes too much, who is reading your chart, talk about what you meant, as your eyes begin to droop. You hear something about an incident involving necrotizing fasciitis becoming evident, even though your flesh seemed healthy, and that there were more traces of it in your limbs, and the call to excise it immediately.

You try to get their attention, you can see the creature from before following the doctor as he makes his rounds, unseen by the other staff and patients in the area. As you begin to succumb to the medicine, you finally are able to motion to the nurse, and leaning in, tell her one thing before passing out.

The painting itself was eerie, but she wasn't sure who had painted it. The person had just wanted to get rid of it. I don't blame them for getting rid of it, I wouldn't keep that thing around either.

When I got home I took a closer look at the painting. It was titled ''Self Portrait by Natasha Richard Genkin''. First of all, or possibly a prank, but who knows for sure. There was also a date marked below the title. ''1979 - 1994''.

After looking at the painting for a while, hidden in shadows. I couldn't see the face, but I was sure it was a woman. She turned her gaze to me and started walking in my direction. As she got closer, more of her figure became visible. As her face became visible, I noticed that she lacked an eye, a nose and both ears. I was now holding a knife, which I instinctively used to attack this abomination. Then I woke up.

During my daily morning rituals (shower, red like fire. For a moment I was able to look past her unnatural features, and she was quite beautiful. The painting was well made, which contributed to the eerie feeling it gave me. I felt sad for her, and wondered if the real artist looked like the painting. It was titled self portrait after all. I didn't feel like destroying the canvas anymore, I felt bad for even planning to do so. I spared the painting and put her up on the wall of my living room. She looked almost happy, and I felt like I had done the artist a favor for honoring her work

I forgot to go to the doctor and just spent the day painting and browsing the internet. The next morning my ear was bleeding. It was kinda numb, I went to see a doctor. I don't have a car, so I had to take a bus. On the buss my other ear started going deaf too, and I was freaking out. Everyone was staring at me. I was scared I might loose hearing entirely, and was constantly looking at my watch and cursing every red traffic light we passed. After a while, someone touched my shoulder to get my attention. I turned around to see a girl with a scared expression standing next to me. I asked what they wanted, barely hearing anything at this point. ''You ea....eed'' she said. I asked her to speak up, even though I barely heard it ''Your ear is bleeding!''. I brought my hand to my left ear. No blood. I looked at her with a frustrated expression. I was already stressed and angry

She was kind enough to escort me out of the bus. She gave me a tissue to wipe off the blood, because before the doctor came to escort me into the room, I saw the other two look at me with a strange expression.

The doctor looked into my ears with this strange instrument, but he just shook his head. I went home worried. Will I ever get my hearing back? I got home and saw the painting on the wall. I'm sure that she wasn't smiling like this before. And I'm sure that her hair used to cover her ears. Was I going insane?

 You then proceed to zip up your black sweater
 You daydream about food and dreams or a while until you notice something….something very eerie.
 You notice how empty it is. You haven seen a car in a few blocks. You haven’t seen one person walking down the street or even in the light of their own homes.
 You start to give excuses like ‘oh its dark out I bet there all inside watching some horror movie
 You haven’t seen one house with a light one since you have started walking. Not one single house.
 You’re not even sure if you even saw a car yet.
 You decide just to brush it off as just a coincidence.
 You start walking again. This time you’re in another friend’s neighborhood just a little bit close to your house. From your point of view the street resembles a long dark hallway. The street is immensely dark. The only street light that is activated is in the middle of the street
 You notice the air is still. Not just still
 You stop for a second
 You feel nothing. 
 You take off your right glove, yeah that’s it…th-that time of night, Right?’
 
 You start walking at a brisker pace.
 You’re holding your ear to see if you can hear anything
 You start trying to step on the leaves to make them crunch against the ground.
 You fail even to do that. ‘It was raining earlier th-there just damp, left, right, left, right.’  
 You start to feel paranoid.
 You start to feel watched.
 You start to feel the eyeless gaze pierce into the back of your skull.
 You see shadows moving in the corner of your eye.
 You start to walk faster. The never ending patter of your shoes continues as if nothing was happening.
 You now start looking over your shoulder. Hoping
 Your mind starts racing ideas in your head. Your paranoia grown bigger and bigger. ‘its nothing
 You start sweating and shaking. Moving faster and faster until *CRASH!*
 your face lies on the sidewalk.
 Your knees hurt and your hands burn.
 You tripped over a rock.
 You slowly get up. The fear you were just experiencing vanishes. Now the silence is comforting. Well the silence except for the constant patter of your shoes. But wait
 You’re completely still. But the patter is still going getting closer and closer.
 You do not think
 You go to your room. You sit down on your bed. ‘It was just the dark

I will start by telling you all that has been happening during the past few weeks. I hope this will help someone understand just what is going on here

Two weeks ago my parents (who are both in their mid 50s) decided to go look around at our old house, I thought I might as well go along and maybe dig around for some stuff we might have forgotten when we left. The house seemed much smaller than when we left, and I got this very ominous feeling from looking at it as we approached. The front door was broken and would not stay open. I left my shoe to keep it open, as I was scared I might get trapped in (I'm claustrophobic and can't stay in closed spaces for a long time). I was going in alone, whle my parents were checking the backyard to see if the swing was still intact (it wasn't). It was dark, damp and overall creepy inside the house. There was a strange smell coming from one of the rooms (I think there were some animals living there) so I decided not to go there. I went upstairs, and to my luck, as the windows hadn't been boarded up like downstairs. I walked down the corridor that led to my old room, swinging in the wind. I laughed a bit for getting scared by something so silly

I pulled on the cloth, written in a strange manner). I looked in the mirror and barely saw anything, as it was stained and cracked. I just stood there for a while, I have not idea what I was doing, but I remember hearing speech coming from behind the mirror. I leaned in to listen to the voice, but jumped back in fear as I heard loud steps from behind me. 

It was my father, and immediately spotted the mirror. I saw her looking at it with a weird expression, and asked why we had left it behind (it was very expensive looking). My mother said it's not ours, and that she had never seen it before. I got to thinking, and to be honest, I had never seen it before either. My dad then yelled us to come over to another room (again, he had moved there with no noise made what so ever) and when we got there, but almost. He had never looked so happy in his life. In his hand he held some very old pictures, the little boy resembled my father.

We left the house, and drove off. On the way home, we visited the house of an old friend of my father's. He was and old man, propably almost 90 years old. He had known my dad and my grandfather, and was a dear friend of the family. I didn't really know him, but I know my parents went to visit him on some weekends. My parents talked to him for a while, and told him they were taking the stuff they found. He didn't mind, and told us he had been keeping watch over the house (which I thought was a bit weird) in case we ever return. My parents then asked about the mirror in my old room. They apologised about me breaking it in case it was his. I was about to tell everyone it wasn't my doing, clearer now than ever. Don't make us go. This is what I had heard, never understanding what had just happened.

I never asked about what had happened during that strange meeting, but then something happened. My father didn't come home one night. We thought he might have gone out drinking (he did that sometimes) but heard nothing from him the next day either. My mother was worried sick, and went to look for him in all the usual places where he goes drinking. Nothing. We asked the police to look for my father, and they promised to find him. I was confused and worried. Why would my father leave like this? A few more days passed, and we got a call from the hospital. He had been found. We rushed over there and saw him in a bed, with all these machines hooked onto him. His face was cut in three places and the wounds were clearly infected. I had a hard time recodnizing him. We were all relieved he was safe now, and didn't even care what had happened. The police officer who had found him like this asked us some questions, but back then I did.

We went home, as I had not slept in two days since his dissapearance. I fell asleep very quickly, and didn't wake up until it was already midday. I woke up feeling rested, and got up. As soon as I did, I heard my mother scream in terror. I dressed up as fast as I could and ran downstairs. She was sitting in a corner, her eyes covered and shaking uncontrollably. When I asked what had happened, she screamed again, and she never, with three cuts on his face,False
1359116552.0,1792zp,The Definition of Insanity,mhd_e,26,7,6,"Hi creepypasta users

EDIT: The first paragraph isn't me trying to take credit from far cry 3
EDIT2: I was planning on this just being a horror like story not like the traditional creepypasta content :/ so my bad...


The definition of Insanity

Ignore? [ I was told by a friend, is doing the same, God damn thing, over and over. Expecting things to change. That’s pretty crazy. When he told me I thought he was lying to me. So I took care of him. But you know what, later on I discovered that Einstein had said that quote, along with a character from a videogame I played, and it started to make sense. Everywhere I looked, was everybody. Every single person. Doing the exact. Same thing. Again and again

My name is Victor Manson. I am 17 years old and have done some bad things. Nobody knows

They won’t.

The scenes keep playing again and again in my head

It was really bad.
     
 My parents took me to see a psychiatrist, I didn’t need his pity. I can take care of myself. 

Or so I keep telling myself, a storm, destroying all that comes in it’s path, which in my case was anybody who was brave enough to care about me.

But I don’t need them

 A murderer. 

They don’t understand the thrill of having the power to have someone’s life in your hands
The psychiatrist, he tried to scream for help. Poor man, it was a shame he decided to have my session in the evening, when he’s all alone in that USELESS OFFICE OF HIS. He had nowhere to run, I can picture it all clearly like it was yesterday. He struggled for breath as my hands tightened around his throat, I could feel his racing pulse slowly fade away. He was dying. I started to salivate at that point, all the excitement numbed my senses, the sounds of the sirens outside were muffled away


It was horrible, his face a deep shade of blue, a chunk of flesh missing from his cheek. I was shaking uncontrollably as I looked around for a place to hide his body. My eye caught the balcony, it opened to the sea being directly below us. It was risky but I couldn’t take a chance. He was heavy,and as i dragged him, the blood from his wound started to smear all across the carpet, making it’s original white colour stained with deep crimson stains. 
I pushed him out the balcony and staggered back and fell on the floor. I was out of breath

Of course this wasn’t the last time I killed, and the thrill of hunting your meat, as nature intended. Nothing makes me feel more alive. 
My next victim was so much more fun, delicious looking thighs. The thought of them make me lick my lips with anticipation. She was tall, very pretty and had long, beautiful hair that flowed off her shoulder like a waterfall. She was a keeper. I remember that I almost immediately had an attraction to her, I loved her. So much that I wanted her to be mine. Nobody elses. But she wouldn’t go for a guy like me, strange, twisted...insane. 
Master would be much happier to have her.

No. I’m not insane, I regret doing what I did to her. What kind of monster kills the girl he loves. For petty thrill. I don’t even remember killing her, It’s always a blur when I kill. Like trying to remember a dream, but alas, you don’t wake up from dreams with a dead body in your hand and your clothes soaked in blood...

Blood, collor done out.
Girls like that. 
I smiled at her and said “Hey Sam
“Oh stop with the cliches Victor
“So what’s been going on with you?” I asked while scanning her body
“Oh not much, her gorgeous blue eyes glistening in the light. 
They looked delicious.
“Funny, with other intentions at mind.

“Sure
“I’ll take you there
“Sounds great! See you then Vic.” She said whilst walking away
I smiled at the thought that this was probably the last time she was going to walk these corridors

It won’t be long now Master

I met with her after school, doesn’t she know she should never follow someone towards the woods. We were silent as we were walking, I could hear her soft breath as she breathed. So gentle, so... fulfilling. 
We reached the woods
“Vic, her arms wrapped around herself trying to keep herself warm.
“I want to show you something.” I said coldly 
“And what might that be?” She asked
“Close your eyes.” I commanded.
“But-” 
“Close them.” I said as I put my hand into my pocket to take out the knife.
The time has come
“I want you to count to twenty, drawing blood from my finger and putting it in my mouth. 
The metallic taste urged me on. 
As she counted I began walking towards her

“Thirteen

Too late. 

I felt the warm blood run down my hands, drinking in the warm blood as I did. I started stabbing her again and again. She started to hit me and tried running away.
There’s no running from Master
“Aw sam, “There’s nowhere to go silly, oh my look you’re bleeding, let me help you with that.” 
I grabbed her by her hair and dragged her deeper into the woods.
“LET ME GO
I chuckled and kept dragging her.
 Master was going to be very pleased with me
I took her to the stone in the opening of the woods, he would help me. He said he could stop the ringing inside my head, he promised he would make me better again, he said I would be free.
I looked up at the sky
It was time. 
I lay her on the stone and cut a pentagram into her stomach
“Hush honey

As I finished the chant, the bloody knife in the other. I breathed in and smelt the blood from her body.

        It was a quiet autumn Saturday in the small town of Crizville with not many people about.  The air was chilly, heading to the corner of his street.
	When he reached the corner, cutting through the chill of the air.  What a perfect day, he thought.
By this time he had reached the lake
	Ayden spun around suddenly, pale girl standing a little ways behind him.
	“Hi
	“Very beautiful out today
	“Yes it is.  Fall is my favorite time of year
	“Claire
	“Ayden, and they stayed quiet for a moment.
	“Have you ever been inside that house?” Claire broke the silence and pointed to the old off-white house to their left.
	Ayden was confused. “No
	She didn’t answer him, pulled him to his feet, and led him to the front door.  When they reached it, she opened the door with ease.  Ayden thought it strange, for as long as he had lived here, this house had been locked and uninhabited.  But, he dismissed the thought and allowed Claire to lead him up the stairs.
	“It’s very interesting, her shy voice slightly higher pitched with excitement.  As she dragged him along, Ayden could not help but notice how extremely cold her hand was.
	They reached the room at the end of the hall on the second floor.  It was then the thought hit him.
	“Wait…” Ayden said hesitantly
	Claire turned to look at him with what seemed like an angry glint in her eyes.  It made him jump; the intensity of the stare, very strong.   But she quickly masked it with another sweet smile.
	“Oh,” She said calmly.  He relaxed.  Something about her voice erased all his doubt, and she seemed so very easy to trust.
	When she opened the door and they both stepped inside
	“Whoa…” he breathed.  The room was filled with sculptures
	“I know all of them
	“What do you mean?” Ayden asked
	“The people that the sculptures represent.  I know all of them.  They are friends
	“Wow
	As Ayden approached one of the statues to get a better look
	“William Heatherbranch, I thought you said you were friends with these people.  You couldn’t have been older than two or three when this man died.”
	Ayden turned around for an explanation
	“Claire?  Claire?!” He called, he discovered it was locked.
	“Claire!  What’s happening? Where did you go? Wha-“but he was cut off by the sound of a man laughing.  Fear rose up in his chest.
	“Who is that?  Did you kill her?  Let me out!  Let me out!” He cried.  Another wave of exhaustion passed over him, but no, it was just another statue.  Then he blacked out.
	When Ayden regained conciseness
	“Ayden!  If you can hear me
	“If you can’t speak
	“I’m here!  Here!” He called back.
	“Where?  Keep talking
	“Up on the second floor!  The last room at the end of the hall!”  Ayden shouted.
	“Ok!  I’m coming!” The person called again.
	Soon the door rattled.  “Will the door open?” The person asked
	“No
	“Ok
	The door fell in to reveal a cop standing in its frame.
	“Are you all right?” the officer asked
	“Just a bit shaken
	“Someone called the station a couple hours ago, son?”
	Ayden didn’t answer, seeing Claire right before he passed out… but wait, it hadn’t been Claire, it had been a statue.  He sucked in a quick breath and turn to look at the statue behind him.  Yes, it was Claire.   But, these were gravestones, and he had spoken to her only today.
	Then
	He was the only child who lived in this neighborhood.

Rumors say that these suicides and illness only occurred after the children playing the game reached Lavender Town, since their ears are not fully developed.

Due to the Lavender Tone

Although Lavender Town now sounds differently depending on the game, and since children were no longer affected by it.

One video appeared in 2010 using a ""special software"" to analyze the audio of Lavender Town's music. When

played, Gold, and Crystal. The Unown translate to LEAVE NOW,

So, my grandma wasn't the most stable person, she wasn't crazy, but she had a different house every time I would go visit. I didn't think much of it as a child, it was always a new location to spend summer.

On the last summer trip to her house, with large spaces inbetween them, and only 1/3 of the houses actually had someone in them.

I remember what started the problems now, who knows), and I would go out into those trees every day and go adventuring like my favorite video game and cartoon heroes.

During one of my adventures, I'm not sure how I heard the scream or if it was hers).

My grandma never drank anything, and one of her legs was clearly broken. I called the police, but what scared me was how she was acting. Kind of flailing around muttering ""I can't run away, the Lungrow can find me I can't run away the Lungrow can find me""

After she had been taken to the ER, and having known her, knew me and let me stay in there with her. I remember getting a pizza that night. She was coherent now, and I remember asking her ""Grandma, what's a Lungrow?""

She choked on her pizza, her and her neighbor friends used to tease this older disabled gentlemen by the name of Henry Lungrow, and it turned into a story for them that ""The Lungrow"" as they called him, would kill and eat any children that ever spoke to him.

About a week afterwards, but I wasn't alone. There was a guy there, who looked as though he had down's syndrome, and having know one or two people with it in my class at school, I knew it wasn't particularly a threat. I said hello and skirted around, because I was still uneasy with the idea of someone else in my forest (the neighborhood had plenty of houses that were occupied, there was no way I was the only one to brave these woods).

Having played a while, anywhere. I checked the kitchen and main living room, the cellar, but I couldn't find her anywhere. I was scared, I called the police again, and they came over, and searched the house. I hadn't looked in her upstairs bedroom, it just didn't occur to me. After doing the search upstairs

I didn't, I my mom and dad came out to pick me up, and spent a lot of time with the police. I was again playing in the backyard, but not the forest, and I saw that same guy, just staring at me. It unnerved me more than I can say, and I went back inside

We stayed for another week or so, and it hit me hard. No on bothered to tell me. The casket was closed, it was a quiet, quick funeral, my parents said their goodbyes to family members, and we went back home. As I've grown, I understand the horror my grandma must have felt, but I know it's him, hiding and moving so he can't find me,self

It's been three nights, hours to days. I forgot how long I've been running, was it safe yet? I risked a second to catch my breath. Listening closely I heard the faint whisper. That strangely familiar whisper. 

I was a regular cheerful teenager until my life plunged into darkness. No. Regular isn't the word. My parents fought, but once he vanished, so did my bleak hope of happiness.

It was three in the morning when a loud crash filled the silent house. Usually this wouldn't have surprised me, I looked outside and almost screamed.

Three months later I was in school, I died three months ago. As they kicked me and punched I just took it. Maybe if they killed me I'd Finally be at peace. Maybe. Then ""it"" came back.

The third tried to run, the creature pounced on him, grabbed him by the hair and ripped his head off. I got up and ran.

I had enough waiting, it's me or it, either way, this ends tonight. 

I lunged, but I wasn't about to stop. The stick broke in half, what i now held in my hand was shorter and sharp at the tip. I stabbed with all my strength towards its chest, it moved. My weapon stabbed through its shoulder, it howled in pain. It swiped at my legs with its other arm and I collapsed. It got on top of me, pinning me down. Blood dripping from his shoulder on to my face. It brought its face close to mine and with that familiar voice, whispered

The last few nights had been relentless. It came fast and hard, only stopped by the mask strapped to his face.


You needed the mask.
The mask, coursing down his cheeks and into his mouth. Washing away the filth that had accumulated over so many years. He knew he’d never do it. He’d seen what the air did to you. People bleeding from their eyes, their ears. Convulsing, vomiting. Hardly a good way to go.


He huddled closer to the candle he’d lit, not if you wanted to stay sane. But the darkness and the wind and the cold, they hit you and all you could do was curl up and hope you weren’t attacked, that your mask didn’t fail, that everything didn’t choose that moment to go wrong.
Lightning flashed in the distance.


Thunder followed.


The lightning made him nervous. The storms had been getting more violent. He could remember when they’d consisted only of rain, more angrily. A month ago, the lightning had started, a flash-bang duet that sent chills down his spine and lit up the landscape. Far too quick for him to grasp his surroundings, but plenty long enough for something to see him.


It was worrisome.


He liked to be in control. Control meant safety. The candle meant safety. He could light it where he wanted, he could make sure it wouldn’t give him away.
He couldn’t control the lightning.


It flashed again and again, thinking he’d have the upper ground if something came at him, but now it just felt foolish. Like he’d placed himself on a silver platter. He hunkered down further, pulling his coat tight, his breath noisy as it reverberated through the gas mask. Once or twice he thought he spotted something in a flash, the head or eyes of one of those things. But it was always nothing. An abandoned dryer, a forgotten air conditioner. Words that were like puzzle pieces to him, couldn’t say what purposes they served…only the words remained. He wasn’t even sure where he’d picked them up


Another flash.


Another glimpse. Something was there. Barely a glimpse of a shadow.


He shook. The fear, clinging to life, to scrape by day after day hiding in the undergrounds, grabbing gasmasks off long dead poor bastards who were lucky enough to die in the beginning, to confront your own death day after day was barely an existence at all. But it was his existence. His life to control, and control was what he needed.
To control anything out here


That thing. That thing out there, out of his sight and out of his Control, searching for him. They couldn’t see well, no better than he could in this storm, but he knew they had noses like…like something. The word had been there, but it was gone. 


He refocused his attention on the candle, couldn’t see him, and his scent was wrapped up in his layers of coats and his gasmask. The flame was keeping everything okay, everything fine. Nothing but the light and the small wisp of smoke rising from the tip-

Noses like bloodhounds. That was the word. They could smell anything, and you would scream and scream and scream and no one would help you because you are alone in the rain and you were to stupid to consider the *smoke.*


He stares at the flare, he didn’t think, and now there’s billions of the particles out in the air and he can’t Control them, can’t get them back, and there’s more of the snuffling things out there.
And he can hear them now. They’re all around


And the lightning flashes again.

1365879476.0,1ca64l,AppleHead,mrdrcore,22,3,7,"I've come into contact with my best friend

After a while, Left 4 Dead 2, all that jazz. However there was one peculiar friend that Jerod had introduced me to. His name was Josh. It was funny, because on Skype, he hadn't decided to reveal his full last name. It read 'josh k.'

I didn't like Josh from the start. He was always annoying, Jerod started to ditch Skyping with me to Skype with Josh. I found that weird, because Jerod kept putting his constant calls down when we were Skyping calling him 'annoying' and a 'pest'.

But, a built in one at that. It displayed static sounds 24/7 and it was really, really pestering both Jerod and I.

After a few months, we could feel his voice becoming more depressed, more stretched, and each time just a little more static. Fast forward a month from now from when he had changed his name.

Jerod told me in March, and couldn't get in contact with Josh. Josh didn't appear in school for 3 weeks, and he was reported lost. A couple days later, Josh was online on Steam. His name AppleHead was highlighted in blue and his status was Busy. I decided to message him anyways, seeing as what had been happening recently.

/Mr. Dr. Core: hey/
/AppleHead: im busy/
/Mr. Dr. Core: what ahppened to you recently?/
/AppleHead: nothing why?/
/Mr. Dr. Core: well jerod told me that you weren't art school recently for a couple weeks and he also said that the cops are searching for you/
/AppleHead: ik/
/Mr. Dr. Core: then wtf?/
/AppleHead: im coming/
/Mr. Dr. Core: wat?/
/Mr. Dr. Core: where are you going?/
[about a 6 minute pause]
/Mr. Dr. Core: hello?/
/AppleHead: what/
/Mr. Dr. Core: where are you going?/
/AppleHead: im running to you/
/Mr. Dr. Core: lolk/
/AppleHead: im in michigan./

I paused for a second. My thinking was abruptly stopped. Jerod hasn't told Josh that I was in Michigan, and I sure as hell don't have any of my locations down on any social website.

/Mr. Dr. Core: how the HELL do you know where i liv?/
/AppleHead: becuz i c u/
/Mr. Dr. Core: what?/
/Mr. Dr. Core: this isn't funny/
[2 minute pause]
/AppleHead: stop touching your eyes

Enough was enough. I was creeped out

/AppleHead: just go to sleep/
/AppleHead: its 1:31 am dud/
/Mr. Dr. Core: where the fuck are you/
/AppleHead: chk ur window/

I rushed to the window that was nearest. Not there. I checked the window in my room. I saw a shadow run past the garage light. I desperately ran to my backdoor

""Josh
There's some rustling in the rose bushes. I walk over

After an hour of searching, there was blue ink splashed all over the wall, and it had said: I'M HERE

I checked my computer and on the Steam chat it had said:

AppleHead: imhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhereimhere

There was a window opened in Notepad. There was a small message that read: find me plz im lost

That night, I heard banging on the door. I opened the door, and of course, nobody was there. I stepped out, taking 3 paces from the door. It shut  behind me. I tried to reopen it, but it had been locked. I heard crashes coming from inside, and when the door had been unlocked, with the window opened. There was a note on the desk by the bed

My dad had moved away when I was little, there was a news report of a dead man. His name read out 'Steve Sch****'. That was my last name. I called my mom quickly, she was sobbing. I asked what my dad's name was and she whispered 'Steve."" I said a quick thank you and hung up.

I went back home from the hotel

I went into the bathroom and found yet another note that read ""Sorry about your wall""

I walked into my room cautiously

I went back on my computer to find the desktop background changed to a complete solid blood red. The more recent message from the ginger was ""im coming back."" He was offline.

I sat down for a while. I decided to stay at a friend's house and take my laptop with me. Everything was fine that day, etc. But when I woke up, my friend David was gone. He texted me saying: ""hey man, im gonna go somewhere, brb soon k?"" He texted me this at 3 AM.

I was able to contact one of Jerod's friends

A message came from my phone from my Steam Mobile app. 
/AppleHead: do it/
/AppleHead: you can do it/
/AppleHead: there's nothing wrong with it/
/AppleHead: just go/

And with these last words I type you can have this:

1362199826.0,19iats,The Demon in the door:,Phathom,20,3,1,"This is a true story

It was painful remembering this allover again, I believe you.

In 1993-1994, we knew something was wrong there, but had no choice. The creepiest part of the house was the door leading to the basement. When you opened the door, you would see on the other side a dark creepy looking monster. It looked like it was trying to claw it's way out of the door. 

At first things were OK at the house. That was until My mom and brother got sick. My brother and mom were both diagnosed with cancer. My mother fought long and hard and passed away in 2000

Back then I was very sick

I hated horror films and never watched them due to my weak stomach. I had a dream of killing my family and eating them, maybe it's the stress of my Brother and Mom being sick, that it would go away eventually. 

It just got worse. I was getting so paranoid that when I went to sleep, but I couldn't scream. 

I talked to doctors about this and the migraines. They said it was all in my head and there was nothing to worry about. I did some research online and thought it was sleep paralysis, I could not scream. I could only see a blank dark face. It put it's hand around my neck and slowly squeezed. It took pleasure as it was squeezing the life out of me. 

It lifted me up out of the bed, the demon disappeared like a pile of ash. I looked into the mirror in horror as I saw markings on my neck of a giant hand and imprints of finger nails. My door was still locked and what I bolted against it was still there. 

I told my dad at the time and he was too tired from work to listen to me. My mom and brother were both at the hospital still. I took pictures of this on my Sony digital camera at the time

I had to deal with this ordeal for several years. I got our priest come by and bless the house. It helped for a little while

No one believed me

I ended up moving out on my own before my dad sold the house. I moved and I lived in a small basement apartment in Niles, but I was able to manage them with painkillers. I didn't have to take sleeping pills anymore. Once a month I would get a really bad migraine, but I would sleep it off and be fine the next day. 

Until the demon came back. He followed me back to my new place and started terrorizing me again. This time the dreams were more violent and sick and twisted

I could not get any rest when sleeping, corrupt me to become a monster. What I thought then was he wanted to possess me, and the only way he could do that, was to make me a monster in his own image. 

My brother came by to check on me and decided to stay the night over. My brother slept on the couch that night. My brother experienced the same thing I had been dealing with that night. It freaked the shit out of him out and he finally believed me. He did some research and found in Chinatown in Chicago a Precious Gourd. (It looks similar to this: http://fengshuiandcrystalinspirations.webs.com/apps/photos/photo?photoid=43680402) 

He said to hang it by my bed and it would capture evil spirits or entities and trap them into the bottle. That night I hung it by my bed

I am still searching for the picture of the door. I have it somewhere either printed out or digital. I will update my post once I find it. The photo is not a photoshop

Will I bother to explain how this happened? I might as well. It won't save me, it was named ''havefun.odt'' and it said ''it's started now. open the picture.'' I closed the file, and didn't think anything of it. I didn't write it, and thought it was a virus so I deleted it and emptied my trash bin. I checked for viruses and found a troijan, nothing major. After browsing reddit for a while, I thought it was time to go to bed. I exited mozilla and on my desktop I saw the folder I had just deleted. I opened it and saw the same audio and image file, but there was now also a ''please.ini''. I thought this was rather odd

Get this, I know) and there was just one file titled ''gotyounow - unknown'' (link to the audio [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMH4ccj6nyY)). I was afraid to play it, but I guess I had no choice. I heard static, and random screaming that was kinda hard to recognize as human voice. It was about 40 seconds long, and at the end I heard a faint sound that seemed to be a whisper. Then, silence. The track had ended. The silence was almost unbearable. Just dead silence. I didn't sleep that night.

You might think that it was over now, they wouldn't believe me. So I go through the day normally, nothing happens. On my way home though, get a headache. Nothing major, just a small pulsing at the back of my head. I got home, and it became a pounding, constant pain. I overdosed on painkillers, and I only remember one thing. The text file changed. It was now just one line, I could taste the blood when I woke up. When I woke up the computer was on. Did I leave it on? I can't remember. The text file was still open. ''7''. I wasn't even surprised anymore. I wanted it all to end.

Too much has happened now to keep track. I only remember when things change because the text file is counting down the days. As I write, I will die tomorrow night, when it reaches zero. I will succumb t the voice and kill myself. It's almost like it's already happened, so many times I've seen it. I won't write anymore, I can hardly think. All I hear is the screams closing in.

It’s just sitting on the guest bed and looking down. I blurt loudly, “What are you doing in my guest room?” “Who are you?” No response at all. No movement and no noise except for the creepy music.
	Regretfully, he decides to stand up. In the most horrifying voice I’ve ever heard, it says. “Hello, Yabarasu. You may know me as Cold_damage.” I was instantly shocked. He found out where I live and now he’s come to punish me because of friendly competition? Again he spoke, “I’ll never have to worry about you again. You can never move again.

In the dark second-story window of an apartment on my route, but... Who would make a toy that simply frowns all the time? I wonder if that's why the owner has left it facing outside. I can hardly bare to look at it from the street; I couldn't imagine what it must seem like up close. Why then, would he keep it? A family heirloom? Yes, that must be it. It's nothing more than some old doll passed down through the generations and the owner couldn't bare to part with it.

What is it, I'm sure it will be too dark to get a good look. I'd rather not bother the family inside, so perhaps I'll just take a few steps closer to inspect it and be on my way. The strangest thing is that as I get closer, the frown seems to get larger. Not just by reference but it seems to be stretching farther across the window... Could it be alive after all? No, that's silly. It sits so still in the window, surely my mind is just playing the same old tricks, but... there's something more. Under its frown is something shiny. No, maybe? That wouldn't make sense. I wish I had a better view. The deeper I stare

The lamps are being lit one-by-one now. The first illuminates the street just enough so I can still see the frown. I take a step closer but the lamplight seems to fade. Another is lit and I can see the glimmer off of those strange objects under the frown. I move closer but still, swaying back and forth. It's almost hypnotizing. I'm getting terribly dizzy but I can't look away. Just as I feel as though I'm about to faint, it all stops. Thank goodness... the light seems to be returning but my vision is so blurry. There, it's correcting itself now and I can see the street lamps but they're... outside. Clearer still and I see a man who appears to be lying in the street but it's all upside down. The street, the lamps, the buildings are all upside down. The man picks himself up and walks away and I want to yell for help but I can't seem to move a single muscle in my body. Someone else is coming along. I need to get his attention. If I try, it seems I can just barely move my lips.

It's been about three months since I listened to the Song. It started off as something do innocent; we were just passing by a boring Saturday by looking up ghost videos and other most-likely fake paranormal phenomena cut on video or audio. If we would have known what we were getting in to...god

The ""Occurrences, on the night we had first heard the dreaded sounds of the Song. Even before that, even as I was first hearing those noises, I knew something wasn't...right. Something about the Song just felt unnatural. It didn't belong here. It shouldn't have existed at all.

But I shoved those thoughts away. Blamed it on my usual easily-paranoid self. Along with the fact that I had an idea as to how the science of the Song worked: low frequencies. Just like electrical disturbances at certain wavelengths it can cause emotions such as paranoia (that feeling that someone's watching you)

So I blamed my emotions on that. Whoever had made the Song knew what they were doing

1373359338.0,1hxako,Why did,Leeoftheswift,20,4,3,"There was this game I was playing throughout the summer
Anyways this all started after my friend approached me and asked if I heard of ""this"" new MMORPG game. I hesitantly said no because I'm actually trying to lay off gaming due to school, I WAS a hardcore gamer back then and I would usually blow hundreds of dollars on some gear I was probably never gonna use. It wasnt more important than my own life. Its just a game.
So, downloaded the game, and watched the opening sequence. I admit, it did look pretty cool. It was the type of game where you hack and slash, find loot, grind for hours, etc. casual RPG stuff. I quickly whipped up a half assed character, and started the game. As hours flew by it got pretty fun
This schedule happened throughout the week. Since this was an online MMO, etc. I came across one person tho, for the same reasons, this person shall not be named. Ill call him ""Slasher"".
So Slasher was typically helpful. Like Giving me stuff I need and I was grateful. We began to be very buddy buddy and even started being my regular ""Quest Mate."" Years flew by and I hardly noticed time flew at all. This game was fun and to me

One day,.. and to this day it haunts me..
""Hey, Ill be back in a couple of days!""
I said ""Sure! Of course!"" with no hesitation. Even tho we can't physically ""see"" each other, to my surprise, plans came up and I couldn't play that day. I didn't have time to quickly log on and let Slasher know what happened. At first I felt bad, but then relief came as I thought ""Its just one day, Slasher will be on a couple more days till Slasher leaves."" 
The next day, am I being punished somehow? Or did I simply run into some bad luck? Regardless of the case, a few days passed and I didn't care anymore. ITS JUST A GAME right? Its not like we actually knew each other. Not even our real names. Our addresses, phone numbers etc. NOTHING. Hell, I didn't even know what sex Slasher is and vice versa. That's why I always refer to this person as ""Slasher"". I had no reason to feel bad. Besides, Slasher probably felt the same way.
Over the years I have forgotten about this game and carried on with my life. It was is as if I never played it in the first place. I even bought a new PC
Days turned into weeks and weeks into months. Whether it was just simply being out with friends or just doing something else

One day I was tremendously bored and decided to Log back on the game. I mean hey, excitement filled me instead. I wonder if Slasher got super high level! Or if Slasher even remembers me.
I logged on and to my surprise, however, as I scrolled down, the mail got more...  violent.. ""HEY! are you gonna log on or what?""... ""I THOUGHT WE HAD SOMETHING FUCKING SPECIAL"".... ""ARE YOU SCARED?"".... They go on and on until the very last letter. The subject was empty and the contents read, ""why did you"" an incomplete sentence. To me, this was all very overwhelming and I wasn't sure what to feel. I felt sad, angry
7/16/12. It was last year. Slasher most likely got over it right? I mean

 Regardless of all of that, years. Over that time I did feel bad. I mean, I did want to play with him like the good times. Slasher's last words were to play with me. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a swell of sadness took over. I didn't know what to do. I knew what i felt was stupid. Slasher most likely moved on. I felt really silly. So I just kept playing, and playing, and playing. Ultimately I didn't mind anymore and my mind was at peace with it. That is until one day, I saw Slasher. Right there. Slasher came from my peripheral and into the center of my screen. At first I was excited. I frantically typed in the chat box
Slasher didn't reply. Slasher just stood there. No motion. Nothing. I typed ""Hey are you there? hello?"" But still no response. The weird thing is... whenever I move, Slasher started to run too. I stopped running and he would stop too. I started to get irritated and typed ""Okay seriously whats up are you mad or something?""
Slasher then turned around, trying to figure out what was going on. Then I came to a sudden realization. I checked my ""Friends List"" and discovered.. Slasher wasn't even ONLINE.. and yet Slasher is right there. I panicked and thoughts started popping in my head ""oh maybe the game is glitched"" but then Slasher stood up, Came up to my character and.. the screen started to glitch, almost like random static. It then started to crash then turn black. Then for a very split second, the screen came back on and it showed a disturbingly close up view of Slasher's character face. Then my PC violently shut down. I tried to turn it back on, but no luck. Fortunately, on the 8th try, it just wouldn't come thru.
The next day
I've haven't gotten that much information until I ran across this one disturbing article.. It was about this kid who died.. on his computer. In his basement. As I read, I kept saying ""This can't be Sl-Slasher.. NO.. This cant be.. I-Its just a game......Right?..

January 30th - My beloved Christie, I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to die then, but I don't mind as much anymore. The supply trucks stopped coming by earlier this month. There wasn't anymore tank water left to give them anyway. I did my best to keep Silvia and Brett alive. I'm so sorry I let you and them down. Brett got caught in that rainstorm while on dump duty. His whole crew walked off the quarry cliffs. I don't think he suffered. Silvia, just, gave up. I tried to talk to her. But she just checked out after you left. She must have drank out of the rain barrel, because I caught up to her about twenty feet from the same creek that you...I tried locking her in the basement, but she just screamed and screamed. She...bit off her own tongue to drink her own blood. I couldn't do anything. I'm so sorry. There aren't anymore emergency radio broadcasts. I don't think there are many people left. I haven't seen anything alive since I saw that helicopter go over two weeks ago. I'm going down to the creek where I last saw you. Maybe I'll end up with you after all. I stay away from the water, the moisture in the air. The voices get louder every day. They whisper through the night for me to join them.

She always did that. She'd say 'you're 33 already. You have to get rid of those toys!'. My grandma didn't understand that I was especially fond of that one. She had already thrown away other trinkets from my childhood over the years and I learnt how to deal with it

'Granny, making you hear the hums of the appliances that  are only audible when our perception starts to get used to the unusual quietude.

'Grandma! I need to talk to you! There's no use in pretending you didn't hear me' - once again, started to grow over me, like it was projected by the dim light of the living room growing distant.

Finally, what's the problem in keeping my teddy bear in the living room? You always taught me not to mess with other people's belongings!' . I respected her and I loved her, but some things had a limit. I needed to impose myself.

The door was open. 'What the hell would she be doing in the dark?'. Before I turned the corner on the corridor, heritage of my fear of darkness that went up until my teenage years, but that I considered myself cured of. 'Old habits never die!'.

Click. Click. Click.

'What the hell?'- the lights wouldn't turn on. I put myself standing in front of the door and saw the porcelain of my little bed lamp torn to pieces in the ground



- I'm sorry
- Grandma? Where are you? I can't see you with only the lamp's light on!
- I had to do it... or else you... you'd never...

Her voice was hoarse. What happened to her?!

I ran to the other side of the bed

Nothing.

- Your problem will be solved now...

What the hell? Her voice came from the other side of the room now.

- Calm down... rest...

With every word

It was my teddy bear. What kind of sick joke was my grandma up to?! I didn't give myself that much time to ponder about it and

After jumping over the bed and extending my arm

She was there. Or him. Or whatever it was. The tiny and worn out body of the teddy bear, until it took a step forward, shining light on its face.

With that step, pain and anxiety. Like someone who commits an inevitable accident. It was there, in the teddy bear, the face of my grandmother. Its eyes were covered by some sort of cataract.

- My child... I gave my eyesight for you... to get you rid of your problem... calm down...

Her mouth didn't move. The voice was hoarse

- Now you will not shackle yourself to the past anymore... Farewell

On a unrealistically fast movement, but as an animal that doesn't want to turn its back to its predator, I ran towards it.

I only had the time to see the last two memories of my childhood

Fallen logs and boulders gave the impression of corpses longing for the warmth of human flesh. I shivered

I began to whistle to help pass the time, but something was wrong. I turned warily round and resumed my slow progress home. 

The forest is never silent, save my heavy breathing and thunderous heartbeat. Perhaps a storm was coming so all the animals were inside. I glanced up to see a cold, cloudless sky. There wasn’t even any wind to rattle the branches. 

I turned my gaze back to my path, a cold wind shrieked suddenly through the branches, ripping the page from the tree and blowing it away into the darkness. 

“A prank. It has to be a prank, down the path, my mind filled with horrible thoughts. I had to get home. I would be safe there.  Suddenly, the path ended. It stopped short. I looked around in a panic. My village was nowhere to be found. My heart pounded in my chest, the only noise in that terrible forest. 
     
My heart finally slowed, ghostly melody of a clock chiming in the distance. I tried to detect which way it was coming from, but it swirled and it echoed so as to come from all around me. I kept going, though every fiber of my being screamed to run and hide. With my head down, I walked briskly when suddenly I smacked my head into something. I looked up to see what it was and I gasped. I finally understood why the forest was silent. Hanging from the branches, by the thousands, were the animals of the forest. Every last animal in the woods hung dead, horrified

Among the grotesque corpses, I entered a clearing. I finally looked up. In the distance, I saw what appeared to be our village bell tower. I went towards it, weaving among the trees, all the while a nagging fear pulled at the back of my mind. 

At last, I saw a girl, not much younger than myself, crying. 

“Hello there

“OH GOD! NO, scrabbling backwards against the tree. 

“No

Suddenly, “You can’t run. You can’t escape. Wherever you go, he will find you.” 

“Who? Who will find me?” I asked

I continued on

At last, thank goodness,” I muttered. Then, when I finally was feeling alright, I turned around. I froze instantly, unable to even blink. The basket of firewood slipped off my arm. Standing amongst the trees was a man. He was tall and well-dressed in a Sunday suit. In his right hand, he held a golden pocket watch in long, I knew that he could see me, skeletal fingers closed the watch with a click and dropped it into a coat pocket. 

Suddenly, the sun began to rise in the east. As it reached over the tops of the trees, I stumbled into my village. It was empty, at this time of morning, quiet. In the cold sunlight, I made my way down the dirt street to my house. I opened the door quietly and stepped inside. As I latched the door shut, I turned. Standing silhouetted in the rising sun was the man with the white face.

As the rain fell down like wrath above me, in the beginning, when I used to try to measure by Abigail. How often she would come to turn the linens and dust. I’d always get fuzzy when I did, I’d get confused, and I’d stop. I used to think something was wrong. I used to have dreams about a little girl and a pretty woman in a meadow, where there was lots of sunlight. I remember sunlight, from Then

“Tea, and brings me the tray with the teapot and the cup. Always. She did this three times in the four thousand minutes I counted. I should not have counted, because counting made the simplicity go away. Counting made me…made me think about too many things. 

I…I saw that Abigail never changed. I have been at the Manor for many, but she has not changed at all. I change. She cuts my fingernails sometimes, and cuts my hair, so I know that…there is such a thing as change. I thought that it was…I thought that it was wrong that things flow into one another. I thought that the patterns were wrong. 

I miss the patterns. I know now that the patterns kept my mind intact. I wish I never counted.

I held time in the palm of my hand. I turned it over and I saw my face in it. I saw the wrinkles around my eyes and the ashes in my hair.

There was something very strange about the portrait, even though it could have been the stern, cruel look of the father, almost mournful expressions of all the others. Andrew

The painting, though what baffled him was that it had not been signed anywhere. Any painter ought to be proud of such a creation. He studied the picture, first on his own, then by the help of his schoolbooks, library books, and the internet. He started to neglect his friends and school mates, turning down offers to go out on the weekends, the work he was doing was important.

All the trouble was worth it as the mysteries of the painting slowly unraveled before him. He realised what made the family seem so odd: Though dressed formally, the kind that was fashionable in the 80s. Each answer he got of the mysterious painting, another question arose.

It hurts to know just what awaits many people out there. This isn't just some story...this
is a warning. At anytime
that the handle to the door will seem to be made of a rough white material and if you touch
the wood a slight pulse can be felt as if veins ran through it. Now this door can and will 
appear anywhere if it chooses you. It could mysteriously manifest in your home as a door 
that was never there before
could even simply appear in the woods while on a hike. I can't tell you how it will happen to you
i can only tell you what happened to me.

I was at work
a new radio after mine had died. As i entered the operations building the hallway was mysteriously
walled off except for a door.....THE DOOR. at first i assumed it was some renovation to protect 
confiscated items so i thought nothing of it and stepped through expecting to see the rest of the
hallway. Instead what i saw was a round room of flat smooth grey stone. It was softly lit but from no
apparent source. The only thing in the room was a wooden table. For a moment i assumed i had zoned out
and somehow managed to get myself lost so i turned to leave only to find the door was gone. It sounds 
cliche but out of sheer confusion i ran my hands over the wall hoping to find somegive or something 
to tell me how to get out. Then i heard him.

""Ask me""

Two words that echoed through the room. Still thinking i was merely lost or something i assumed it was
someone in another office so i wrote it off and keep searching the wall.

""Ask me""

This time it sounded louder and more...present i suppose. I turned to see a man sitting at the table now
opposite where i stood. My voice seemed to turn off out of fear because i could not bring myself to say 
anything and for some reason i didn't want to. The man was slim and wore a two color suit. the left side 
of the suit was solid black and the right side was white. His eyes copied his suit but reversed. His left 
eye was solid white, nothing but white, his right was the same except black. Even though 
they lacked any indication i knew he was looking at me

""Ask me""

seemingly on instinct i approached the table and sat down. His gaze never left me. It almost felt like part 
of me understood what to do but it wasn't my brain. He continued saying those two words over and over. every 
few seconds until i could feel it building up in me. This will sound weird but i don't believe my brain formed
the question. i fell like it came from my soul.

""Ask me""

My body responded. ""What am I?""

He gaze widened and a jolt of pure unequaled fear shot through me until he spoke again.

""You are one of the few.""

And with that he opened his mouth revealing teeth that seemed not to even fit in there and a pure blackness 
behind them where a tongue or throat should be. From his mouth came a horrendous screech that felt like rusty
nails scrapping over my mind. Visions shot through my head of people being horrendously mutilated
skin and flayed
very same room i was in now. When the screech stopped the visions didn't. As long as my eyes where closed all i 
could see was the suffering of those people. When i finally opened them i was now standing and facing the very 
same door i had come in through with the man standing beside it. I felt another question boil up in me.

""Who where they?"" i asked refering to the visions

""They were the many.""

And with that there was nothing. i walked back through the door and was once again standing in the hallway of the
operations building. The door was gone and the hallway was open again. But now i can't sleep
even close my eyes. All i see when i do is the suffering and torment of the people who did not make it out of the room.
So i warn you all now. If you ever see a door that seems out of place
OPEN IT!!! The door will not leave until its call is answered and you will want to see but i beg you to resist.
Every minute my mind is flooded with more people being trapped in the room and i cannot bare to see anymore.

Most of my family lived on the other side of the country and were unable to offer me any support. My friends and coworkers were too involved with their own families and problems to lend assistance. I was forced to search online for some type of cheap

My desperate predicament had doomed me to post an ad that essentially begged for aid. I spent a few moments articulating the ad

After reviewing my advertisement

     You can stay with me

I scratched my head, hoping there would be at least one or two more replies by morning. I climbed into bed and quickly succumbed to a deep slumber, my worries having weighed heavily on my mind the past few days.

My alarm clock buzzed annoyingly and read 10:00AM. It was Sunday and there was no rush to wake up, I double clicked the web browser and navigated to my email home page. It loaded my account automatically and showed three new messages.

     “Oh good

I proceeded to read the first message:

     Phillip

That’s odd

     Please stay with me

I felt a bit uneasy at this point. The wording

     YOU CAN STAY WITH ME

I jumped back in my chair. I didn’t know what to think.

I spent the rest of the day perusing online ads

Later that evening

After a few hours of cumbrous drinking and self-pity

     “What do I have to lose at this point?” I asked myself.

I quickly jumped on the computer and devised a response

     “What the…?” I bellowed.

I got up and walked over to the nightstand near my bed, and put it to my ear.

     “Phillip

Surprised

     “Phillip

     “Who is this?” I sternly questioned.

Silence. For a few moments, out in a rural area.

The next morning, looking through the messages. I again found the address of the out-of-place area.

For her 8th birthday, the dog never left her side, he was her most loyal friend. 

Fast forward one year, it was almost as big as the girl by now. On this particular evening, the girls parents was staying at a friends house, so this was the first night alone, for both her and the dog. She wasn't scared though, her best friend was going to be with her the whole time, she had nothing to worry about.

After sitting up late watching the TV
""Come on. Let's go to bed."" she said with a yawn.
The dog stepped out of the couch and began to walk to thier bedroom. The girl turned of the TV and followed the dog. She brushed her teeth and then laid herself on the bed. The dog, and, as usual, the girl let her arm dingle over the bedside so her dog could lick her hand. That always made her fall asleep.
And so she did.

An hour or two later she was awoken by the sound of the dripping faucet in the bathroom. It disturbed her, letting her hand dangle over the bedside, letting her dog licking her hand.

An hour or two later
""Uugh..."" she thought to herself as she crawled out of bed to shut the faucet again. She went back to bed

An hour or two later
""Not again..."" she murmured to herself as she stepped out of her bed to close the faucet. She closed the faucet. But from the corner of her eye
""Oh, she noticed something was wrong. Instead of the normal black spots on the fur, there were red spots, the more she uncovered, the more frightened she got. The bathtub held only the carcass of a mutilated German Shepard and blood. She noticed blood on the wall behind the bathtub, so she looked up. There, inscribed with blood stood only one statement.

1365481778.0,1byy1b,The Fear of Prey,Redex_Ceo,19,6,2,"I’m not a man of many words… but if I may, so I quickly took to walking. 

Every day I would walk, what would happen if… so many questions, not many people had the time to think about these things but the peaceful quietness of the town would just get me thinking about those kinds of things. Every day I would walk and take the same route… and no matter how I tried to avoid it I would always pass through that graveyard. The first two days were uneventful and boring, but I was still happy. But then on the third day, it was probably the first sign that something was off. I should’ve paid more attention to it.

On that day I had there were a few hooligans messing around with the graves. They were messing around and seemed to just be having their own fun so I didn’t really pay any mind to them. Then I heard some kind of large crash. I looked over to the hoodlums and saw them running off from some… large mess. Looking around I too see if anyone else was around… not a single soul in sight. So I casually walked over to see what the little thugs have done. The damage didn’t seem too bad; they only knocked down a little stone cross. I looked at the grave it was originally on

‘Mary Walsh’
‘1920 – 1925’
‘Loved Daughter’

I stared at the grave for a few seconds before returning to the cross and picking it up. It was actually much heavier than it looked but I managed to pick it up. Placing it back onto its rightful place I stepped back to look at my handiwork before I noticed something in the patch where it had been laying; a crushed
“Dallas”
“Clymer”
“Whitman”
The names ran on and on. No two tombstones were the same
“Whitman”
“Clymer”
“Dallas”
Eventually I had returned to the Grave of Mary. Here is when things start to get a bit odd. The Stone cross and rose were both gone. I looked around for some chance that someone had taken it or that by some miracle a gust of wind blew them away… Once again I only saw an empty dead graveyard. I didn’t pay too much mind to it; I reasoned that for whatever reason someone came in and took it while I was off exploring. I started on my trek home where the next thing happened. It was a small glimpse of a white face through the trees. I only caught glimpse of it and when I did a double take I no one was there.  The rest of the walk home was uneventful
I should have realized by then what was up. I should have realized something was off. But for some reason my brain just rationalized this as some form of coincidence. I was such a fool.

That night I went to go to sleep, A continuous cycle of me shutting my eyes, suddenly jolting up and looking for some unseen predator about to strike, and finally going back to shut my eyes.
The next day was a killer; I had not gotten any sleep so I felt I was going to drop dead at any moment. I couldn’t keep my eyes open but I couldn’t quite close them. Work was a hazy memory but I do remember finally being able to fall asleep on the couch as soon as I got home. By the time I awoke the sun was setting and there wasn’t any time for a walk

After a little digging I had discovered that Mary was the daughter of the pastor in the olden days. He was famous for his way of reaching out to people and his burials. However one day his daughter disappeared. He was stricken with grief; he quickly began to become more hostile and kept to himself. After a year of searching she was announced dead… Unable to cope with the loss the pastor was found dead on his own steeple

Finishing my researched I stretched and casually looked out the window, so pale it was easily noticeable through the inky darkness. All it did was pace back and forth, back and forth, slowly, steadily, monotonous motions emerged as I just watched. And the more I watched the more thoughts filled my head. I knew I should go out but every primal instinct was telling me to stay where I was. I couldn’t let it out of my sight, less it pounces on me unsuspectingly. I felt I might need to call 911. I tried to reach for the phone, something I’ve never felt before

Then something I can’t fully put into words happened. A little girl
*Matthew Gunn has come online*

I raced for the mouse and clicked through all of the windows until I reached Skype. Frantically clicking his icon I Pressed the call button, and tried to lighten the mood by cracking a joke. A little annoyed I told him I had to go and hung up. I laid my head on the keyboard and stayed there for a while before going off and getting ready for bed.

That night was just like before, but if I knew my luck they would call me crazy. So I waited the night out, with no occurrence. The following day I stayed inside… I couldn’t bring myself to opening the door. I kept it locked and tried my best to look around the internet for something… anything! That might explain what had happened the night before. Slowly I could feel my mind getting weaker and weaker… I felt more and more like a stalked animal. Occasionally I would turn away from the computer and look at the corners, at any flickering shadows. Every time I was greeted with nothing. I found this one story of something called the slender man… but he didn’t quite fit. And as the story goes I would probably be dead right now if it was him. A few more terrifying images and stories… moth man… Jeff the Killer… none of them quite matched the figure I had seen.
By the time the sun went down I was a nervous twitching wreck. I had gone 36 hours without sleeping and thoughts were racing left and right. What was it? What did it want with me? Am I going insane? Is it even trying to kill me? WHAT DOES IT WANT! The fear was unnatural; I didn’t want to be hunted. I just wanted to live my life. I can’t leave

And then he came back. He paced left and right, and then he finally turned and looked at me. He had cold dead eyeless sockets. I looked at him and his sick twisted face, it was contorted in pain yet was smiling with a sense of satisfactory… he looked relieved that some pain was finally over. And then the girl once again came and took his hand. But I knew he had seen me… I was next… he would take me soon.

By now I could tell I was alone on this. My friends over Skype all thought I really had lost it. I was rocking 48 hours without sleep

“Mary loved roses... they were always her favorite.”
SO I went to my kitchen and found a vase of flowers and picked out a rose. It was crimson red and looked freshly plucked. It looked perfect for her. I still don’t know where this thought came to me from

That night the man came pacing, 

“Here you go… Mary.”

 This of course surprised her to no end. And we stood there for a long time... when a car’s headlights could be seen speeding down the road. The little girl began to cry all of a sudden… she looked torn… and in one quick flash of motion the figure raised his right hand. It had a large blade protruding from the wrist.

This was it, and in a blur of motion the old figure was pushed onto the street. It let out a cry of rage and grabbed me, pulling me out with it. We wrestled for a few seconds when I saw a blinding light and heard a deafening noise. 

Exactly one week later I woke up in a hospital, and I finally felt relaxed, nothing was trying to hunt me down and kill me. In fact I almost thought it was a dream, when I looked over and saw a note. With a rose: Thank You.

27.8.2012
I am investigating a case which has been left unsolved for months now. I'm not doing this for the sake of wanting to know the truth or anything like that. I'm doing this in memory of my partner

The night he did it, who had seen hundreds of corpses. Even though it was his job, he was scared. I walked over to the tray my partner was on and he slowly pulled the cloth covering him. He asked me if it was him, and with almost sad eyes turned away from the corpse. I collapsed. It was horrible. His face had been cut three times and the wounds were horribly infected. His skin was pale. His eyes were the worst part though. They weren't rolled up or closed. They were wide open. His expression was blank, but his eyes were so horrifying I couldn't look anymore. I felt sad and angry. What could make him do something like this? I knew it had something to do with the case he was working on, the same case everyone else had left unsolved. I blamed them. They did this.

The worker there stood in silence as I cried my eyes out. After I had calmed down a bit, and stopped. He stopped as well, and asked me ''What kind of man was your partner?'' then quickly pulled the cloth covering another body. It was his wife. I was almost numb from seeing the body of my partner but this still hurt me. I wasn't as shocked as you would think, I didn't know her that well. But a thought crawled into my mind when I looked over to a tray close to this one. It was clearly a child. I immediately knew who it was, even though she was covered with a cloth. It was their daughter.

My mind was racing. Who had killed them, and just below her stomach.

It was no wonder that my partner had killed himself. No one could live with this. His wife and child murdered. And the things the killer had done. I made a promise that day. I promised to find the killer. I will find him, not knowing what to say. Before I could get a word in, he continued ''His wife, daughter, his face, everything. He did this himself. With a mirror piec-'' I bashed his head to the wall. That fucker was lying, and I knew it. He was lying to me at a time like this? How fucking dare he? I left that place in rage and didn't even hear what the worker said as I was leaving.

28.8.2012
I'm still angry at that worker. How could he say something like that? Killing your own family

It's now afternoon. I found a few notebooks there. It seems he was keeping a diary to help with his investigation, and found out he had visited and old man called ''Rick'' before his death. The address was there, so I will go to him as soon as I can. I need some time to deal with all this.

1.9.2012
I went to see that old man today. While I was driving there I saw this old house that was pretty close to the one I was visiting. I got a bad feeling from looking at the house and felt like something was calling me there. When I got to Rick, and went to that house. When I was leaving, Rick said something like ''don't go''. But I had to. Inside the house it smelled bad. I found some birds and a cat lying dead in one of the rooms. It made me kinda sick, but I kept going and proceeded upstairs. There were three rooms, and one of them had a mirror in it (picture here http://i.imgur.com/piXEBkF.jpg). My partner's notes mentioned it too. Here's the clip that speaks of the mirror: 

''*The mirror is cracked and blurry. The gold edges are stained with what looks like blood, and I even found the dead crows. I'm going to go talk to that guy Rick again and see if he knows more about this place. Hearing the story of this mirror has really gotten to me. I swear I can hear a little girl crying for help now.*''

After reading that I went to Rick again. He told me my partner hadn't come to see him again

2.9.2012
I just woke up from a bad nightmare. It was the face of my partner screaming inside that mirror. Behind him stood a man with no eyes and three cuts on his face (positioned just like the ones on my partners corpse. One on the left eye, so I'm gonna take some sleeping pills after I'm done writing this. I hear knocking. This is what he wrote in his notes:

''*The mirror is in my house. I can't fucking believe this. I'm too scared to touch it

I don't have the strenght to go on anymore. I read his notes. All of them. He did it. He did it and he wrote it all down like some fucking psycho. That morgue guy was right. Even his own daughter...he raped his own family and killed them. I can't take it

''*I've killed them...my family...that dream happened. Everything I saw in that dream happened and I just watched myself do these horrible things to my family..even after they died. The mirror is evil. It made me do it, but I see people around me. They're just a blur but I can see it's my family and some other people. A man with no eyes and his son, a girl who cant be older than 15 and her mother. And that man.*''

This is the end of a text file found on the computer of a man who confessed to murdering his wife and two children. He was found face cut in a river by two police officers on a patroll. He was sent to prison for life

There is one exception to the buildings still standing and not having been restored. It is a small manor, the manor is extraordinarily extravagant with its forty-four carved statues of ravens, for which the manor is named for. The house though it has been declared condemned, has also been called a historical site and thus it has not been torn down. 

I shudder as I recall the local legend about the man who used to own the manor

Has the legend goes, he would commission the local sculptor, Howard Poe, to carve from granite a statue of the particular raven. Has the story goes, Mr. Van Buren commissioned the forty third raven to be sculpted, and upon its completion, Mr. Poe brought the bust to the property. 

Several months later, Mr. Van Buren knew this bird was going to be larger and much stronger than all the others he had raised. He was so elated that he went to the town pub, got drunk, and was reported staggering through the streets singing, ""Finally! He has come! The Raven Lord has arrived!"" He raised this raven for seven months before the fire broke out in his house.

It was a rather dry summer that year, and that is the official story. The, unofficial story, is that Mr. Van Buren set the place on fire intentionally himself in a strange and weird ritual to the Raven Lord. 

There are only two facts supporting this statement. Fact number one: no human body was recovered from the fire. Fact number two: That night

The mayor asked Mr. Poe to sculpt the forty fourth and final raven in both honor of Mr. Van Buren and the raven he so dearly loved.",self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/10oiij/the_house_of_44_ravens/

“Hey, but is now missing. Recent reports say that the bodies were brutally attacked by wild animals, perhaps a pack of wolves. No tracks have been able to confirm this theory due to the heavy rain the past few days.” 

The television screen then showed the bodies. The corpses of two kids, lying in grass just outside of a wooded area. The limbs appeared to be barely hanging on by a few tendons. Besides that, the heads of all of the carcasses all shared a similar trait, missing pieces of them. Literally, chucks of the bodies were gone, no teeth marks, just gone. My brother and I stared in awe at the sight, “How the hell does a pack of wolves do that to three kids?” He shrugs at me. “Maybe the wolves were on steroids, Kyle?” I asked him. “Yeah?” he replied. “Aren’t supposed to be getting Keagan here pretty quick?” “Oh, around 7 Pm” I answered. “Ok

~

It`s about 9:30 PM, Kyle and I, decided to see what happened to the three kids. Upon arrival to the area, we jumped out of the car, clicked on our flashlights and started our search. Through long grass trees we found the scene of the animal attack. Having not noticing the gruesome sight at first, the stench of the blood and something else made me vomit at a glance of it. “Hey, Keagan!” I called, their flashlights beaming through the dark. “Did you find something?” Keagan asked. Still gagging through the stench, “A few kids were apparently attacked by a pack of wolves, something was looking back at me. In the trees glowed two orbs back at me. The thing creeped up slowly
	
When it got to about five yards away it stood up on two feet. It stood at 6 feet with little fur at all; it resembled a decomposing bear carcass with patches of fur and muscle desperately clinging to it flesh. In between its shoulders is a horse skull
	
Kyle ran, but that didn`t stop it. It bulldozed over me like I was nothing, making me black out. 
	
I woke up a few moments later with Keagan was dragging me back to the car. I looked back with blurry vision, luckily the doors were unlocked. He dragged me into the passenger seat and ran into the drivers seat. He reached into both of his pockets. “Fuck! Dillon, where`s the keys?” He shouted at me. “Kyle has them; maybe you can go ask him for them!” I shouted back. 
	
“Well, the beast rushed out from the trees tackling Keagan. The thing ripped a hole in his chest, grabbing onto his rib cage and pulling it out. I sat inside the car, staring in fear at what`s happening. But my heart sank when it saw me inside the car. It walked towards the car; on its face I could see a grin. It shook its head when it got to ten feet away. Its head busted through the window, gripping my head with its jaws. It jerked its head back out, tossing me out the car. While I was on the ground I realized that my body was still in the car. Then everything faded into black, and I felt at peace.

Anyway, this one wasn't your typical nutcase. This guy was twisted in a whole new way, by the end he was known locally as the modern day mad monk. Now, this guy had a thing for literature. File said he was locked up after he ran out of things to write on and carved up his family. I saw the photos, bodies half rotten covered in words just gouged into the flesh with fingernails. And this guy himself, died scratching words into his chest with a spoon. 

So, this place was creepy as hell. Nobody had touched it since the 40's when all the freakjobs got transferred to state penn. We'd all seen stuff like this before, chipped paint and rusty wheelchares make great television after all. We weren't ready to see his room. The walls were covered. I mean covered in writing. Words written over words again and again, some written in pen, others in ancient food smeared out. In places some words had turned a brown colour, we didn't want to think what these words were written in. It was strange, staring at all the words. None of it made any kind of sense

So we set up our usual gear. Cameras here a fan or two just out of frame there, Jenna. I guess, I think she was a boom operator? She latched onto that room. Said it was something about the atmosphere that she couldn't let go of. I only checked in on her once. She was sat on the floor legs crossed staring into the wall, all of those words, like they were staring right back at her. I don't know, maybe they were. I remember I tried to check up on her, placed a hand on her shoulder. Jerked half out of her goddamn skin like she'd seen a ghost. Shame I didn't get it on tape really. After that I left her to her wall. Left a camera in there with her since she was the only one who wanted to spend time in that tiny little cell and left her to it. That was my biggest mistake. 

It was another hour before we heard hide nor tail of little Jenna. When we did we wished we didn't. We found her in the pitch black, wouldn't talk to me, wouldn't talk to the crew not a word. That wasn't the worst thing though. I was the first to find them, the markings. She'd used a hairpin. A goddamn hairpin to cut her flesh. The words looked all too familiar. 

So, all that, that madness scrawled onto the walls. Maybe that's what made her snap. It wasn't until after someone took her pin off of her that she decided our other cast needed some extra body art. I read the reports from back then, our modern day mad monk killed several orderlies just for some extra writing space. He'd pin them down first, they never died quickly. He would bleed them from the words carved onto their bodies. I came to this shithole with a crew of seven. Now there are only two of us left. It's been five hours now and Jenna... She's still pounding on the door. I've managed to seal myself in here. No way in hell is she getting through that door. The thing is, I don't think it would matter either way, of all the cells I could have sealed myself in after she turned. How many must there be

I've been in here longer than she was. Even as I write this I can...Feel them, I'll look up and see lines jump out at me. Just another scrawled line that holds just a little more meaning. Not sense, you see. Meaning. I don't see the full picture yet but it's coming to me. It's beautiful, really. The words, they all fold together and twist and turn in the most beautiful poetry  imaginable and every second I read the more the pattern unfolds. 

I think I said something, I don't think anyone should know. That would ruin it, the poetry of it. I also realise that nobody is going to read these last few lines. I realise that I ran out of paper to write on over an hour ago.

The house was old and the floors were creaky – Jack was the eternal bachelor, since I am a very light sleeper. However, as the months passed by I got accustomed to waking up early.

I cannot tell you the exact moment I realized that something wasn’t right.

Over a number of days, but the heavy footsteps that I woke up to and sometimes heard during the evening had seemed to disappear completely. Perhaps Jack was sick, I thought. Perhaps he hadn’t worked in a few days, perhaps he worked different hours. The man was a real loner and kept to himself, so it honestly didn’t seem strange to me. I only really talked to him when I went upstairs to give him his rent money on the first of every month. He was never unfriendly or rude, but short with me, didn’t have much to say.

I looked out the window and saw that the light was on in the garage. The blinds were closed

The last couple of days the truck that he drove to work had been sitting in the driveway when I left in the morning

It was around 5 P.M. I was on my computer, being moved. More shuffling. I heard the phone ring multiple times, but nobody picked up. A few minutes later, I could hear Jack slam the front door shut and walk towards the garage. As he passed by my window, I looked outside.

Now, this was different. There was something unnerving about his gait, but I couldn’t put my finger on what exactly was wrong. Arms hanging at his sides, he was looking up into the sky. I couldn’t see his face, but for a moment it looked like his mouth was wide, wide open… was that his tongue bulging out, swollen and black? No, it couldn’t be…

I closed the curtains and locked my door. Never before had Jack frightened me.

That night, but angry. A man’s voice, loud, shouting in rage. I couldn’t make out any words. Was it Jack? I stumbled out of bed and fumbled around in the dark for my clothes. Not really knowing what to expect, I looked around for something to defend myself with, and grabbed a knife from the kitchen. With shaking hands I called the police on my cell, ran upstairs and beat my fist against the door.

There was no answer. The house was dark and silent. Jack’s truck was there in the driveway, and I talked to the officers briefly in the driveway, but they left after looking around outside and not finding anything out of the ordinary. Useless cops. So useless. I turned around, and the house loomed in front of me like only houses in the dark can. I thought I saw movement behind a curtain.

After an hour or so I crawled back into bed. I did not sleep. I just laid there

There was only silence.

Thankfully, the phone rang multiple times. Nobody picked up. I spent the day with millions of thoughts running through my head, jumping at every little sound the house produced, kitchen knife never out of reach. Had there been a knock on my door that day I would probably have suffered a fatal heart attack.

Nightfall brought a sense of despair. I did not see anyone walking by my window that evening

Sleep came late, Jack was standing by my bed, looking down at me. I remember his face – foreign, cold, filling me with a deep feeling of dread. And then, something had roused me from my sleep. I looked up and that lingering feeling of dread escalated into paralysing fear, violently wedging an icy spear into my spine – because for a few terrifying seconds Jack was right there, like a ghostly image burned into my retinas from looking into bright light. I screamed

Looking back, whatever it was. I needed to not be scared anymore. This needed to end. When dawn finally came after what seemed like an eternity, I looked outside and felt my heart skip a beat when I saw something moving around in the lit garage. This was it. It had to happen now. I needed to know the truth. I grabbed my trusty kitchen knife and climbed out my bedroom window, which was not visible from the garage.

Crouching

The kitchen window was open. It was open… I still remember every terrible detail so clearly. After picking together the last bits of courage I could muster

Then… The smell. That awful, on the floor, next to the broken dishes… God help me.

I did not go back inside. I didn’t stay. I drove away, staying put in the garage until the police arrived. I drove until I was too tired to drive any further, then I pulled in on a side road and slept.

I never went back to the house.

A few days later, especially in the unattached garage, but I did not read any further.

It's no secret that modern technology is a marvelous thing. We can record, using the great machines we call computers. They're compact, powerful, and fast to a degree that is often difficult to understand. We have seen them undergo incredible improvements at a phenomenal speed.

Take, it was considered a gem in the world of computers, with a blazing fast 0.98 Mhz processor. Let's not neglect to mention its floppy drive system, which imbued it with 170 kilobytes of storage! Of course...it is now the year 2012, and computers have come a long way. Japan's K-Computer now has a processing speed of over 8 petaflops. It's so fast that the old system of measuring processing speed, Ghz, had to be largely abandoned. Meanwhile, which will feature 500 petabytes of storage.

There is, for now, surpasses even these behemoth computers, and that is the human brain. The brain's storage, estimated at 2.5 petabytes, has already been surpassed, however, you see. While computers think in a linear fashion

Where am I going with all this, computers are not the only thing we humans will wish to improve. Inevitably, our computers will surpass the power of the human mind, and we will fall to our temptations. Why should we suffer a feeble organic mind, prone to errors and eventual death, when we can simply upload our minds, personalities, and all onto a computer? While many say this is impossible

Still not seeing a problem, will far surpass you. With a processing speed rivaling that of light itself, how long do you think it will be before you go through every possible thought and emotion the mind could have ever had? A minute? Two?

How long do you think it will be before you decide, and mind the power button...

Charlie spat the toothpick out of his mouth, middle finger fully extended, before reaching back down and grabbing the line close to the water. He yanked hard on the brown stained rope, and with herculean effort, hoisted the taut line upwards and looped it over the pulley winch. 

""Bought fucking time."" Charlie swore as he slapped the large green button on the winch's console. An electric motor kicked on behind them and the rope began steadily pulling out of the muck and fed into a nearby covered housing. 

Dean stood back and wiped the back of his arm against his sweating brow

*Join us, Drink, You will be one* 

Dean looked down at the back of his glove

""Yeah man."" Charlie interrupted. ""Here."" He said as he leaned over to a bucket at his feet

Dean used the cloth and wiped his face with it. Immediately the voices softened to a hushed whisper.

""Are they bad?"" Charlie asked.

""Nah man, do we have any Cokes left?""

""Department can't afford them anymore. We got three cans of Ginger Ale and then we're down to drip bags.""

Looking up and down the fence, they could see countless spots that looked just like it; Bent and twisted links smeared with a ruddy brown color along an otherwise unchanging gleaming wall of metal as far as the eye could see in both directions. 

""Call it in?"" Charlie asked. 

""Fuck it. Won't do that poor bastard any good anyway. Never seen em come back from the urge when they're like that."" Dean responded morosely. ""He'll slit his wrists to drink his own blood if they lock him down. Besides

Dean wondered if there was any point to the madness that the world had been reduced to. Every natural water source in the world contaminated at the same time. The survivors of humanity reduced to living off of whatever liquids and fluids that had been bottled

As if to emphasize the point, she walked down to the river bank and waded into the thick muck with outstretched arms, quickly disappearing beneath top layer of blood and decomposing flesh. 

""Shame."" Charlie said

Dean grabbed his hook pole and snagged the body of a small child that was starting to slip off the boat. He manuevered it back into the fresh catch slowly moving towards the mountain of corpses already piled high on the barge. His mind briefly touched again on the futility of it all, and canned goods were dwindling fast, and the Urine Recycling plants could only function for so long. Assuming one could avoid any rainstorms, eventually they'd be driven mad from dehydration. Ten years, maybe twenty, there'd be no one left to haul his bloated corpse out of the small runoff pond next to his house.

I click on Disney Junior, why not? I’ll probably fall asleep soon.” The episode is Minnie’s Picnic. I’ve saw this before. I used to watch all these silly shows when I would wake up early because nothing was on. So the episode started out like I remember it, Mickey and friends were getting ready to go to a picnic. 
	
But something was off. I couldn’t really put my finger on it; something was bugging me. Then it hit me. Pete wasn’t with them. Pete normally walks out of the closet with a picnic blanket before they leave the house
	
They had the picnic like they did in the actual episode, if it wasn’t for the overalls that it wore. Pete wore those overalls. His legs were completely gone, and he had bite marks all over him. The blood was too hyper-realistic for my friend. He ran in the bathroom and threw up. 
	
Mickey and Goofy drag what was left of Pete to a backroom that I never seemed to notice in the other episodes. When they opened the door
	It was only me left. They hung Pete up and slammed the door. I couldn’t take anymore of this. I shut off the TV and tried to go to sleep. I couldn’t
	
A few days later, but I found nothing. I am now scared of Mickey Mouse and all the other Disney characters and can’t go on my family’s  annual trip to Disney World. This episode has truly ruined my life. If you do stumble across it please do not watch it.

She sat on the couch

“It’s gorgeous

Her half smile was quiet.  “Be careful

Picking the jar up

“Liquid light

The jar was warm to the touch

“Hm

I looked at her, and the opened jar began to whisper audibly.  I looked at her, perplexed.  “If you’re going to open it, then at least listen,” she mouthed.

I put my ear to the jar’s opening.  A child’s voice reached out to me, and I awoke.

Finding myself in my bed, the feeling slid away from me, and seeing that the clock next to my bed read 3:47, I rolled over and fell back asleep.

Thud.

The shovel had thickly struck wood.  A very large man clapped me on the back and boomed from behind a thick beard, a dozen men standing waist-deep in half-dug holes ranged around mine.  They promptly scrambled out of their own excavations and began clearing sand from the heavy chest I had uncovered.  When they had hoisted the box carefully up to ground level, the captain crept lightly forward and lifted the lid.  There had been no lock.

I could see a brilliant glow from inside the treasure chest, suddenly realizing I was in another dream.  I waited, wanting to hear what the pirate had to say about the golden liquid.

“Hm?” he said

I nodded.  “Liquid light.”

A roar of laughter met my words.  “Liquid light?” the captain mocked.  Turning to his men

“No, turning back toward me, “this ain’t no light, and it ain’t no candle, neither.  This is nothing less than the pure, distilled essence of gold.  More valuable than any mere ore; why, this jar alone is worth more than the Crown could part with

I wanted to hear if there was a voice in this jar, this happened to be my dream.  And when you know you’re dreaming, you may as well be a god.  I reached out, and the jar jumped out of his hand, floating toward mine.  Taken by surprise, he unsheathed his sword with a growl.

I glanced at him and jumped lightly into the air

The same little boy’s distressed voice greeted me.  “Please.  Help me

“Who are you?”  I asked, beaten piece of parchment, a treasure map.  Unfolding it, I was surprised to find a modern-looking street map on the inside.  I gazed for a moment at the crossing streets, noting a large black “X” drawn over one of the intersections.  

When I awoke

The next day dawned bright as the essence of gold.  I awoke, and the grey-eyed woman and the pirates swam back to me.  I could hear the little boy’s voice as vividly as I had in the dream.  I briefly wondered if someone was trying to reach out to me from the other side, but I shook this feeling off quickly, not even really knowing what I meant by “the other side.”  Still, I kept thinking about the little boy and his map throughout the day.  I kept looking at the map I had drawn; I was unable to recognize the shape of the area it depicted, but something about it rang familiar.  I felt silly for half-expecting to recognize it, but by the time I went to bed that evening, but not quite

Whoosh.

The wind rushed past my head.  I was tumbling, several more screams, and a futile attempt to gain any sense of my bearings, I saw a flash of light.  Another moment, another midair flip, and I saw it again.  I thought for a moment that I was seeing the moon each time my body turned over itself, but the third time I saw the light, I steadied myself in the air with a thought and called the jar to me.  It smacked into my palm with a satisfying

I eagerly unscrewed the top, illuminating the whole world.  I saw a tangle of huge buildings below me.  I did not recognize them until I noticed the Statue of Liberty off to my right.  I was hanging, motionless, in the air above Manhattan.  I listened close to the jar, and the boy’s voice, more urgent even than before, said, I realized that the map I’d drawn from the last dream had been of the island below me.  

It is possible, as far as I could tell, was an old warehouse, well away from the nicer parts of the Borough.  I dryly hoped that I wasn’t about to get myself actually killed following these stupid dreams.

My initial impression had been correct.  The building was in a terrible location.  I could just see it at the end of street I was walking down.  As I reached it

I pushed the door open and stepped inside.  It took a moment for my eyes to adjust to the gloom.  In front of me was a staircase headed downward.  A faint glow rose from the floors below.  I started down

At the bottom of the staircase lay some sort of factory.  Small

“You’re going to need this, this jar was filled with a murky and dull yellow liquid.

“What is it?” I asked.

“Nightmare

“What is this place?” I asked

“The factory.  This is where we manufacture dreams

“So the light in the jars—“

“—are dreams

I took a moment and really looked at the boy for the first time.  He was thin—too thin

He saw me staring.  “Things in the factory…are not good.”

At that moment, but I could hear the whip crack and the pathetic yelps that followed the voice.  This wasn’t a factory for dreams—it was a sweatshop.  

I turned to Yusef.  “So you—“

“—write and deliver your dreams?  Yes.  A few days ago,” he explained, trembling, “you have to help us get out of here.”

A very large hand clapped my shoulder.  “Who is this!?” its owner yelled fiercely.  Looking up, unscrewed the lid, and dumped the contents onto the man’s head.  He fell to the floor, gasping at private terrors. 

I looked at Yusef.  “Good one

The boy wordlessly produced a sack of the things.  I grabbed one in each hand, “Upstairs, everyone!  Let’s go home!”  They didn’t need to be told twice.  As the children dropped their tools and ran upwards toward freedom, Yusef and I stayed behind, nightmares in hand, to cover their escape.  To my surprise, only three more men came out of the woodworks to pursue the fleeing children.  Yusef and I each felled one with a thrown nightmare, whip in hand.  With a look

Determined to recapture the little escapee, tripping him.  He fell face-first, hard, into the staircase.  I jumped over him, took the stairs, and was out the door in a moment.  He followed, but stopped short at the door.  I stood on the street with the children in broad daylight.  He moved no further.  He didn’t dare run after escaped, then slowly shepherded the children away.

The stamping of his feet on this cold hard floor is unmistakable. Such a long powerful stride. My body tenses as I can feel his presence thickening the air that I breathe. He stops and the deafening silence returns seemingly drowning out my own thoughts. The fear builds with the anticipation. Every time he comes to me I wonder to myself, no one can hear you, no one cares, you are mine.” Each syllable causes me to cringe. My heart races and my skin flushes. The stench has finally arrived. It turns my stomach, and I gag. The smell of dead and dying things fills my nostrils as I struggle to breath. The stench is so palpable that I can taste it. Eventually I succumb to my body’s urges to vomit. I try to raise my hands to my mouth to keep from spewing everywhere, but the chains restrict me. 

I almost forget that they are there sometimes, his hand engulfs my shoulder and the searing pain begins. I try to muffle my screams for as long as I can. I think he enjoys hearing my scream. The burning sensation quickly rushes over my entire body. I feel like if I had clothes on that they would  turn to ash by contacting my skin. I wish that I would just turn to ash and this would be all over. 

With his one hand he lifts me to my feet. He walks around to look me in the face. I never understand how even in the darkness I can see the emptiness of his face. His cold dark eyes seem to stare right into my soul. I have no secrets from him. I can hide no fear or sadness. The subtle smile on his face makes it all the worse. He enjoys this. He enjoys it as much as I dread it. His hand, to die, to end the pain, but he would never allow that. He knows he must keep me alive to maintain his pleasure. 

My screams can no longer escape. Only the screams I hear in my head remain. Only the silence can reveal the sound of my blood dripping on the cold floor. It feels warm on my feet if only for a moment. He begins to laugh. The thundering booms of his voice echo in my ears only outdone by the excruciating pain. His laugh fades as he begins to walk away. Each long stride more emphatic than the last until I am once again left alone in the cold

The following is taken from the culprit's diary

(there is blood covering one or two sentences in the beginning of the page) and we're going back to see the old house again. I'm propably going to take some pictures too. It's going to be fun seeing what shape the house is in. I just hope it hasn't been sold or demolished or anything, even after his death. Oh well. Maybe I'll go see Rick too.

We arrived at the house and it was in pretty ok condition (considering it was already rotten when we left. I was sure it would have collapsed, and he took my camera with him, so I don't have any pictures of the outside. When I went inside I noticed a smell coming from one of the rooms. When I looked inside I saw some dead crows lying on the floor. It was horrible, as some of them were half eaten. Poor things propably got trapped inside somehow and got attacked by a wild cat. I closed the door, and hoped my son hadn't seen what was in there.

I went upstairs, and I could almost swear it was...well, It's impossible so I won't even bother writing it. Anyway, I quickly followed to see if I was right, and in the room stood my son, and no one else. I was relieved. I almost thought that bastard had returned, but it had just been my eyes playing tricks on me. I bursted out laughing, but there was a mirror in the room

God, save one cardboard box in the corner. I opened the box and the anger turned into overwhelming joy. There were all of my family's portraits. My sister, my mother and me. I looked like the angry kid I was back then. I told my family to come over and have a look at the pictures. (blood is covering some words, and the sentence makes no sense)

When everyone was back in the car, and she knew what I was thinking. She knew about the mirror as well. I don't want to explain the story, but maybe I should anyway.

The reason I hate that mirror is my dad. The mirror in itself isn't evil, all of us, my mother, sister and me knew that we had to hide. He would grab onto his bottle, and start humming this tune that haunts me to this day. He would come after us, and whoever got caught, was to be tortured in front of that mirror. He would just beat me up, but mother wouldn't leave him. We didn't really have any place to go anyway

One day, and had no idea how to react. I was just numb. I must have passed out after that, because the next thing I saw was mom and dad fighting. By fighting, I mean my dad had pinned her down and was hitting her. I was so scared, I ran away and grabbed the phone. There was just one number next to the phone, titled Rick. He was a friend of my dad and dropped by to visit every now and then. In panick I called him and told him what had happened. I then hung up without even waiting for a response. I ran to the mirror room, and saw my mom lying on the floor with a shard of the mirror piercing her throat, standing over the corpse of my sister. I was filled with rage. I saw what had happened to my sister when she was caught and put in front of the mirror, and turned around to face me. I was 10 at that time, that I didn't care about what would happen to me. My father had to die.

I sliced his face three times, and started coming after me again. This is when Rick came through the front door and tackled my dad. He pinned my dad down, and started looking around to see if everyone was alright. You could see that all he wanted was to snap my dad's neck, but the police he had apparently called arrived, and took my dad away. He got a lifetime in jail, because of some asshole laywer who got him out of deathrow. I explained what had been going on to Rick, who almost threw up several times during it. He took me in and raised me as well as he could, buried it deep in the forest. The house was left with no owner

I had told Grace the story about the mirror and my family when we moved in to live there

On the way back home, almost scared expression. He told me he had thrown it away. I'm not sure, but I think he meant he had thrown it away again. I was scared. I couldn't say anything and just stood up and left. Grace followed.

We got home and I put the pictures on the kitchen table. I was still thinking about that mirror, but I will go there.

1352999305.0,138x0g,The Davenport Demon (Wrote this quite some time ago),ColtonH,30,16,7,"It was the year 1964 in Davenport

During the summer of 1964, the woman – a Miss Clarissa Belle – pointed out something weird in the river water. Almost immediately after, ""something horrendous reared from the water, and raced across the road,"" as put by Clarissa Belle when interviewed a few weeks after the second sighting, when it began to be taken seriously by the media. The couple barely had time to make out what it was, and the man – a Mr. Samson Browne – slammed on the brakes.

They stopped, stayed in the car as Samson Browne got out to check it out. While the car had been splashed with river water, it was undamaged and they returned to town, only mentioning it as an oddity to their friends.

It was in late winter of 1969 that the second reported sighting of the “demon” was made. In this instance, this time on River Drive on the way home from Credit Island Park.

The “demon” emerged from the river's icy surface in a sudden surprise lunge, described it as “ugly and vile, almost like a disfigured raccoon with the most godforsaken tentacles”. Surprisingly (unless a frequent reader of such newspaper reports, where witnesses that were together frequently contradict one another), Hank Miles had left out the comparison to a raccoon and described it as almost catfish like, except with tentacles instead of fins. This description was the same as their friend's, except in that simple comparison.

In the 70s, Britney Cooper, were putting their boat into the harbor at night when the water began to have a strange light from it, as if there were “Search lights underneath the water's surface.”

They were intimately entangled when suddenly the boat tipped, and that a “thing with tentacles” had attacked the two of them. The burn marks on his body were explained by the idea of something electrical being dropped into the water with them. When the body of his mistress was found, it was burned completely to an almost unrecognizable point, except for the face.

This first deadly encounter led to Lee being charged with manslaughter despite his reporting it as an animal attack and the wounds being nearly impossible for the man to make (without specific equipment)

By the 80s when the last major newspaper report on the Davenport Demon was made (which was another event like the first death from the “demon”) it had become a local legend. To this day, none of these stories have been put into the newspapers and have merely been mentioned by people who live in Davenport, and even then mainly people who had been hunting it much like the more popular Bigfoot Hunters.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/138x0g/the_davenport_demon_wrote_this_quite_some_time_ago/

Anyway, it looked a little run down, something of a fixer upper, with its pale green paint and  the shingles falling off of the roof. It seemed erie. It was a old shore house that we got a deal on and even though it needed to be fixed up, we were happy. Our first night there, we slept on the living room floor.
In the middle of the night
When I awoke the next morning I was laying next to my wife. I had assumed the whole thing was a dream and I told my wife what happened. She said it must have been the fact that we moved into a new place and the happiness I felt of being here. She just smiled at me and told me not to think anything of it.
That day the movers arrived and we started putting things in their rightful places. It started to feel like home. 
A week had passed and nothing. No dreams of laughter or anything. No light
We were happy. This place had a feeling of happiness and a sense of peace.
The next month went by in a flash. We started to paint and fix up our kitchen. I remember my wife going into town for some things when that light had appeared again. This time I knew I was awake. I heard that same laughter on the patio. As I walked towards it, closer and closer to the shores edge. 
Over the waves and the laughter, Beth. Whatever this thing is, it wants me to come with it towards the water."" 
She looked puzzled. ""So you're saying a ghost or something is pulling you near the water?"" I nodded. That's when she laughed and told me that stories would get me no where. She then walked back inside to attend to our son. I remember standing there for like seemed like hours when my wife called me in to sleep. 
That night, even as drawn out as a mermaid. I didn't really believe that it was a mermaid or anything he said but at this point, I wasn't sure what to believe. 
Around three in the morning after talking to my friend
I woke up the next morning to the smell of pancakes and coffee. It had seemed that my wife had gotten up early to make us breakfast. 
I dressed and walked to the kitchen to see my wife and two year old eating. ""Morning."" I said with a smile
""Yeah
That's when I heard something different in her voice. ""I slept fine babe."" I pulled out a chair and sat down. ""What's on the agenda for you guys today?"" I said through a mouthful of pancakes.
""I was thinking we'd go for a swim. Would you like to join us?"" She said with erie sincerity.
""I think I'll pass. I gotta catch up on some work."" I was lying. ""I can watch Joshua if you want.""
""No. I wanted to take him swimming with me."" He coed as Beth said his name. ""Are you sure you don't want to go swimming with us Steven?"" This is when she gave me the oddest smile I had ever seen her give me.
""Yeah I'm sure. Are you doing alright? You've never given me that smile before Beth.""
""I'm fine."" she said as her eyes darted from me to the window quickly.
After I finished eating I went to our bedroom to message my friend again. My message was as follows:

Howie
You know how I told you about that light and you gave me lists of what it could be? Well

Steve

I sat staring at that note

Steve
Is there anything she has insinuated towards the ocean or anything like that. She could be possessed or drawn to the same light like you are. If I were you

Howie

After I read that message, ""Steven, it's okay. Everything is okay. Follow me into the water and peace will find you."" I looked up to see my wife with outstretched arms on the shore. She was beckoning me, trying to coax me into following her towards the water. The laughter was deafening now. As tears filled my eyes for the death of my son, I saw the light. That peaceful light, surrounding my Beth. The tears stopped and I felt pulled again. I started shaking as every fiber of my being didn't want me to follow. I reached my wife and she grabbed my hand.

I want to stress that I say ‘random garbage, all sorts of nonsense out there and left it to rot or rust. I mean, just bizarre stuff, regarding how much work it would be to just haul that shit out there - who decides to abandon a fridge in the woods? What do you do, take a hand-truck or something and wheel that shit out into the trees? Or an engine block, or a book shelf - we once found what looked like most of a dollhouse, left to be eaten up by nature. Just really random crap. 

That particular day, we were all kind of treating this like this might be the last time we saw him. We had backpacks full of pop, my d-cell battery-powered stereo, lots of snacks, etc. The weather was really great, and overall it was a pretty good time. 

After several hours, and none of us had thought to bring flashlights. 

About halfway out of the woods, on the way, John noticed something off the path and pointed it out. It was a chair. 

We all got closer to check it out: none of us had noticed it when we were leaving the clearing for the first time, so we turned back to leave, taking the chair with us.

For such a small thing, but John’s mom had apparently inherited the set from his grandmother, and would be really upset to find out a chair had been taken, so we took turns carrying/dragging it as we walked. We came to the conclusion that some dick had stolen it for laughs, then left it. 

After we left the woods, it had fallen and injured his mom. It broke her foot, but she recovered alright. We managed to get the chair in the moving van while he found out what was going on, so they never even knew it was missing. After he moved, I didn’t hear a lot from him - we just kind of drifted apart. I guess it was a friendship of convenience, given how close together we all lived.  

I’m sure you’re wondering where the creep-factor in all this is supposed to be: well, and a table for card games. At some point, someone else - when we weren’t there - smashed it up. We decided to use the broken chunks as firewood, but took note for the first time that the letters SGT - which we took to mean ’sergeant’ had been stenciled on the side that must have been towards the ground, as well as what seemed like a surname - meaning this had been some Veteran‘s trunk. Out of curiosity, we googled the name in our local area, and with a little sleuthing, HAD lived

I know it’s a long shot, and after years and years of finding so much random crap out there, I couldn’t help but wonder about connections. 

This past year, and stolen the stereo from all those years ago. Nothing came of it, of course - 

After all

I figured it was some shitty prank from my “experimental” friends from down the street. We’ve tried nearly every reasonable drug there is

DMT, some experimental shit this dude sold me for wayy too much. Shit fucked me up… I tripped I was dust floating down from the ceiling. Lasted like eight hours. Fucked… me… Found the shit on my porch one night… Fucking ding-dong ditch or whatever. A little baggie up…

Anyway

I threw it on my dresser and crashed for the night.

I called all my friends the next afternoon. They all “claimed” they had nothing to do with it. “Wasn’t them”. I figured one of them would fess up eventually…

Over the next week, or it really wasn’t them. I didn’t feel like mentioning it, we had some concentrated Salvia, so we lit that up.

The next day, so I dont know. But it entrigued me even more. I examined the pill. I reasoned with myself. I just couldn’t take it, it could be anything, but I was so curious. What if it was THE best high, the MOST psychadelic trip. I talked myself out of it. I set it down again, and I couldn’t help but feel like I was missing out…

The next few days were hell… I had a fever, I die. I felt like dying anyway. For all I know, it could be some fucking antibiotics. I hoped for the latter. I looked at it one last time.

I downed it.

I remember “waking up”. The world was in negative. I was strapped to a chair, but this was different. I felt empty. Time was moving backwards. Light was inverted. These dark lamps pulsing energy through my brain. A bass tone vibrating my body. I couldn’t close my eyes… I needed these “lights”. They were blackening the world. My world. The world where I resided and wasted time in the light. I finally understood. I was in the dark.

I started seeing the figures after what seemed like an eternity. Black masses of energy crawling towards me from every angle. I was seeing them in strobe. As the dark flashed

The strobe frequency slowed. Time started to speed up. The figures were stationary. The light was coming.

My cornea’s burned as the trip wore off. My emptyness enveloped me. The stobe was near out.. The figures no longer visible. I finally closed my eyes. Such a pale dark compared to true darkness.

When I opened them, but I had to open my eyes.

My luminous mind was telling me it was just a trip. Don’t go back. Forget the abyss and return to normal life. The darkness was in favor. I didn’t want to go back

Night came. I finally opened my eyes. Not to let the light in

My body was weak. My eyes so adjusted to our world’s pathetic darkness

I “awoke”

I was back. Again in the chair. The dark was so comforting. Time moving the way I remembered. My frail body energized by the tones. The strobe showing me truths. The darkness was truth. I waited for the figures. I was confident they would take me this time.

Finally they limped into view. I praised them. Every strobe showed promise that I would soon forget light. Their movements were choppy and slow. But promising.

I urged them closer. Watching intently between strobes for their presence. They were getting close. I could feel them. Their pulses heavy on my chest. Our hearts beating in unison with the strobes. They were here.

The saviours were had arrived. They circled me. Crippled creatures that would transform my world. They opened my eyes to the dark

When I opened them, an endless abyss void of light. This was what I had prayed for. Where I belonged. I never had to see light again. To open my eyes to anything but black was impossible. I loved it.

I got up to walk around my uncontaminated world. The dark Eden.

I stumbled over something. Something in the void? I felt around. This overewhelming darkness contained something familiar.

My old world.

But what would you do when something truly suggestive happens? Would you run

Last Monday was a normal day. I got up, until I saw the strings.

There were three or four thick twine strings in my room. They criss-crossed between the walls around my bed

Nobody could have been in my room while I was in it, untied the strings and left for school, leaving them balled up on my desk.

It didn’t get any better later. Outside my house there were hundreds of them, across streets… This had to be some super elaborate prank. One of those hidden camera shows, or a comedy improv blog. They had gotten everyone else to play along too; passers-by were tangled in them, tying them to objects they were walking towards and away from, as if they had been and were continuing to follow the course laid out for them.

I nervously continued my journey to school. On the bus, at this point all I could wonder was why I had been left out.

When my friend Lucy sat beside me in first period

“Hey Lucy.”

No response.

“Come on

She sighed and started taking books from her bag. All the books were tied to her hands. I grinned, letting it drop to the floor without a moment’s hesitation.

“Um.” I leaned down

“Well, but really just trying to hide my nervousness. I bundled all the strings attached to her together with one hand, then pulled them all free. She blinked, turning to stare at me.

“Holy crap

“I’ve been sitting here for maybe ten minutes.” I smiled again

“Where did all these strings come from??” She gasped

She stood up

“They weren’t here just a minute ago! Do you see them too??” Her tone made it clear she was genuinely scared.

“No. Didn’t you-. “ I was interrupted by my teacher slamming the door behind her. Everyone except me and Lucy murmured a good morning, before turning to our teacher. “Hey! Dumb bitch! You can’t teach for shit!”

No reaction.

“I’m getting away from all this shit.” Lucy pulled a few strings aside and left the class. I followed

We wandered the corridors



I showed her the street outside; there were more strings than when I came in this morning. Twice as many. We carefully picked our way through the tangle, fear of the unknown sometimes seems like the safer option. On a few occasions, I suggested we untie a few more people. Lucy was opposed to it, remembering how terrified she’d been.

In the coffee shop, and sat down. We both ate in silence, both of us too scared, both of us distracting ourselves by watching the strangers in the shop, oblivious to the strings. After twenty minutes, Lucy spoke up. “Now she’s gonna take that sandwich.” She said, pointing at a woman across the shop. Sure enough, according to the prophecies of the strings. “That guy doesn’t intend to pay.” I watched as a man took his coffee and ran out of the store

“This is horrible.” She whimpered. “Let’s go. Please.”

Outside wasn’t much better. Everyone just followed the strings’ instructions

Away from the busier part of town there were fewer strings. It was nicer; we could pretend it wasn’t happening.

When we turned onto Lucy’s street

“What now?” I broke the silence

”Look.” She pointed outside one of her neighbours houses.

I saw it clearly, walking along with its knuckles on the ground, almost like a monkey. It had two bulbous yellow eyes taking up about half its face, and no mouth or any other facial features. It was holding a hammer and a ball of twine, which it was letting out behind it.

It walked quickly and quietly from the front door of the house to the mailbox. It stopped, and stopped when it spotted us.

My bottom fell out even further than it had already been

I looked at Lucy, and then halved it again. This wasn’t fear of the unknown anymore; it was fear of this little guy. Didn’t seem like anything to be scared of. When I was a meter away from it, it extended its hand.

“Uh. Hi.” I shook it. It nodded in approval

“So you’re the ones in charge of the strings?” It nodded eagerly. I called Lucy over

“There are more of you?” Another nod. I wanted to ask it so many questions

“Do we even have free will?”

It just looked at me, who had been listening to our exchange, and now sat on the curb with her head in her hands.

“Come on.”

We entered her house, crying. I set the tea down and sat beside her.

“I’m so scared.” She whispered after a good ten minutes of sobbing. I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

“I’m going to sleep” She mumbled suddenly

I collapsed to the rug

I felt much better the next day

My sister loved to laugh. She had such a bubbly personality. She would find just about anything funny. But one day, I shrugged it off. We all have those moments. When we laugh when something isn't funny. Nothing too big

 The next day was a lot stranger than our average day. My sister still had a case of the giggles. That's not the weird part though. The weird part is that she was watching a horror movie. A brutal one at that. Laughing uncontrollably. This sent a shiver up my spine. But some horror movies do have comedy. I still asked her what was so funny. She just kept laughing as a character in the movie was being murdered. I had to leave the room.

 The following day...is one I will never forget. I was sleeping in after yesterday and I just heard my sister laughing per usual. I tried to going back to sleep but it was just to obnoxious for me ignore. So I go in the kitchen and see...something I couldn't bare myself to describe. What I saw still scars me to this day. My sister was just standing there with the kitchen knife. And behind her...were my parents. Soaked in blood. Dead. And she was laughing uncontrollably.  I slowly backed away and called 911. Thankfully

 After all of this happened, visited my sister in the asylum. And every time I see her she just sits there...laughing uncontrollably.

I had a weird feeling in my gut knowing the date was not 12/4/????, Jack was a little worried and said ""Hey guys I'm heading home my parents would catch me dead if I'm out at midnight."" So he had left, Me and Brandon were a little curious so we walked to the front porch.

On the front porch we had noticed a small hole that had a resemblance of a face, the house was all lit up, the lights were on and in the house was completely empty... Knowing the lights were on Brandon, without any warning knocked on the door

We heard a faint ""coming...!..."" We stood waiting around two minutes so Brandon a complete fool knocked on the door again

As soon as I had said that a noise came from the door screaming ""COME IN!"" Knowing Brandon the ignorant person he immediately stepped in, We were trapped and scared.

We had entered a black and crusty bedroom almost as if it had been burnt. We heard a faint noise that I could barely hear

""He's coming ??? The????""

The bedroom had drawers that Brandon had opened revealing nothing but old newspapers the print was faded but I could make out a few words

    I have always been a paranoid person, matter what happened during the day I would get these terrible thoughts at night. At first the thoughts wouldn't be so bad, but as I got older it got worse I would lay in bed and see hallucinations of demons and killers standing over me...staring at me with their soulless eyes and their twisted smiles.

   
    Eventually I decided that I was sick of living in fear. So I went to go see a therapist


   When I got home it was late, it's face was contorted into a horrible smile that showed its blood stained teeth. I stared at this character thinking to myself that it was merely a figure of my imagination, and that it would soon fade away.

The cheap key chain he had just bought had a little light, the red spot started to make his eyes relax. His sight had no longer a clear focus.
It was kind of a calm despair that he felt. His head was working like crazy in the morning, guess what, things were going too slowly for him. He felt an urge to create, and with that came the agony of not having the inspiration.
He left himself seated for as long as a bored mind could remember
Letting his head fall to the side as the hope of some idea crossing his mind started to fade

- Cold.

He said
Had the bad weather ruined his trip or was it himself? The signs were evident for anyone looking for them

- What if….

He’d never know the truth. The bridge falling off, and even the dice with letters that he threw as a joke didn't stop spelling “DEATH” on most of the strokes. Add that to his friend’s mother dream, and there you go. Everything miraculously turns into signs.

- Maybe I should just get that damn bus. The curiosity is killing me.

Should he gamble with his life just to test the mysterious ways that surround us? Or do they? It’s just speculation in the end
The song’s mixed up vocal parts didn't help much on that matter: words put on top of other words

“Meshuggah… now THAT’S a good band name.”

His mind wasn’t that idle anymore. Maybe his head’s clock had started to rotate too much without him perceiving it. Seconds later

-Still this is cold wind… but what the hell

His id was sounding like a lady with that temperature thing

“Was it my id or my ego? Was this a RATIONAL choice based on an irrational arguments that I gave myself or it simply was a 'don’t you even think of dying now' thrown in the air by the animal part of my thinking?” 

He wasn't feeling anything before


The Night Before

-Just throw it again man. It’s impossible to get THAT again.
- Here goes nothing…



A moment of silence.




- There's no way we’re doing that man.
- Oh c'mon look at us! We look sound wussies!
- First of all
- No idea. We were invited
- Man
- Does the four hundred bucks that came along with the letter sound like a joke to you?
- And how the hell do we know that it’s real?
- If these were fake bills and the letter was a joke
- Shit man… I don’t know.
- COME ON!
- Yeah
- I fucking hate you two.
- THAT’S THE SPIRIT!

And a few drinks after deciding

- Man

As his eyes started to get in focus again

- Yeah
- Guess what road that is?
- OUR road?
- Correctamundo.
- Well so what man? They’ll just get a different route and we’ll just spend a couple of hours more on the road. It’s worth the squeeze man
- Well
- Ok man
- Sure thing

In the middle of the word “bed” the phone was already hooked. Not for long.

- FOR FUCK’S SAKE I gotta take some sleep!
- Dude. My mom had a bad dream.
- What? Ah
- Yeah. And I died in it.
- Fuck man… talk about bad omen! Haha!
- I’m not fucking kidding you dude. I’m not going anymore.
- C’mon damnit. Hey
- Dude





Some five hours later his mind changed.

“That’s it
	
And after setting things up for the delay, cursive type, a name and a phone number.

- Well, he said.

And he did. Before he could say “hello”

- Yeah

And the connection was cut.

“What the…”

Precisely five minutes later, he could see a limousine.  He went outside, and the door opened. The now known voice said “get in kiddo, it’s time to roll”

- Water?
- Oh… yes please. But can you just tell me what’s going on?
- Just drink your water and relax

So he did. And he fell asleep.

Three nights before

- Man
- And all of them mentioned our trip.
- AND it’s on the way there.
- Man
- We don’t have to bring anything man. How is that related to drug dealing?
- Dude... I don’t know. Maybe that’s some sort of code.
- “We’ll have more
- Man
- Come on
- Fuck… okay



When that dialogue came to his head in a dream
Where the hell was his head when he called that man? 
	
“What was I thinking?! I needed the money but hell

As his cognitive system started to work fully again he felt strangely cold. His legs were numb. He tried to move them with his arms but his arms were tied. A thick rope swirled around his wrists
No cries could describe how he felt
The scent he could get from the ambient was a mix of stone and something he could not remember what it was

“Iron?”

A quick flash of his childhood came to his mind. One time he was running around
A cold shiver went up his stomach and filled his torso.  Where had this much come from? There was no doubt at that time it was his.

“FUCK!”

Desperately looking in the places he could in his body, trying to turn and see what was going on on his back. With that, the ropes just got more and more entwined, causing a sharp sting on his arm that had almost no skin anymore.
The only idea that crossed his desperate mind would simply have to do. He bent down as much as he could, and pushed his arms back, so he could see his hands. He spat as much as he could over the ropes, which were looser as his weight wasn't strangling his arms anymore. When he started to feel the blood reaching his wrists, he started to pull his arms slowly out of the knot. He prayed for it to work.

The hooves are right behind me, and my skin blisters as it alights on my neck.  Eventually, I will need to come to terms with the pain, but there’s no time now.  
I know that turning to catch a glimpse of my pursuer will cause me to lose the single step of advantage that I’ve miraculously managed to maintain.  Consequently
But then . . . an open door.
I dive into the darkness and throw my weight against the heavy barrier.  A split second after it slams into place, there’s a single clanging strike from the sword on the exterior of the door, and they are gone.
I let my breath come in ragged sobs.  This isn’t possible.  I was always the first to discredit and disprove the ghost stories, because the concrete is frigid under my feet.  Sickening dizziness overcomes me and I vomit.  
I realize that, icy fingers close around the ankle that I’ve left in the darkness.  In an instant, I trade cognizance for hysteria.

It must be an original part of the compound, because it is covered in the style of bridges from the turn of the century.  It looks rickety and anachronistic compared to the utilitarian building to which it is attached.  There are no lights in the bridge, yet the darkness seems welcoming.  I am suddenly certain that my only chance for safety lies on the other side.  Behind me, the door handle begins to turn.
I sprint to the bridge . . .

You could say I was crazy, it gave me something to take my mind off the fact that I was nearing thirty five without so much as a whisper of a family. “Hi, I’m Marise!” she casually informed me on the day I met her, grinning wildly as children do. Let me give you some back story. I’m a teacher at the elementary school here in the small town of Coleville, been here all my life. I was reminded all too much that I was lacking a significant other by the kids I teach, but I guess I just never found the right person. Anyway, Marise turned up one day to my class, she wasn’t on any school roll and we couldn’t pry any information about her parents or where she lived out of her. We all felt a bit sorry for her so we decided to let her stay



Fast forward a few months, becoming fascinated by her shoes before muttering “I don’t really have anywhere to stay...” What would you do? It’s not as if I can just turn a little girl back to the streets. I drive her back to my place after school on a Friday, wary of how suspicious I must look, even though I do occasionally give my students one on one sessions at my home. She runs through my door as soon as it’s open, jumping onto my couch excitedly yelling “Is this where I get to sleep?” I nod and she seems overjoyed. I wonder what horrible things she must have been sleeping on all these months. 



I began to like having her in the house. In a way she was the daughter I never had. After a while, telling her that was important that I know where and who they are. As I finished the sentence I saw her expression change. Her inquisitive features dropped into neutrality. A complete withdrawal of emotion or thought. A cold primal fear clasped my insides. It barely lasted a second before she was back to her smiling self though, laughing the question off and carrying on with her drawing. I was too stunned to push the question again.



And don’t think I didn’t consider going to the police, and for a few weeks too. I ended up looking online for local missing children, and there were surprisingly many for such a small town, although I had seen on the news that almost all of these kids were found alive, as well as warnings to keep your kids safe, but none were Marise.



I came home from shopping one day to find the house deadly quiet. I figured she was out gallivanting as she often did. I put down the groceries on the counter. A frantic, I turned around to see Marise standing in the corner of the room, now silent as a mouse, facing the wall. I must have missed her when I walked in. I blurt out “Marise, what’s wrong?” As she turns her head to me I saw that same expression as before, sending ice through my veins. “Nothing.” She smiled.



The next few weeks unnerved me more than anything in my life. I would watch her at school making new friends every day as usual, only... different. They lacked the sparkle in their eye, the spring in their step. I loved Marise as I would love my own daughter, but I was simultaneously terrified of her. I chose not to ask questions.



One afternoon I brought back another student, and I mean silent. I could not hear a single sound outside the bathroom. I opened the door and saw the kid face down on the desk with Marise right next to him looking at me with her expressionless face. I nearly ran, but I realised I had to get this kid to hospital. I told Marise to wait there, as I put the kid in my car. As I drove off Marise said “I like when you bring other kids round to play!”



The kid awoke from his coma three days later, he was different. The doctors had no idea what happened, so they told his parents to keep an eye out for any similar incidents. As much as I was scared of Marise, I was even more scared of losing her. I convinced myself that she was troubled and that I could help. After some time I recognised the relation between what she was doing to the kids, and her awful screams and mood swings. The other kids seemed to make her happier. So I brought another child home for tutoring. And another. And another. Each time I told myself this would be the last one she needs.



 I didn’t want to be alone.

The words reached your mouth almost unexpectedly. “They will not dare to attack me again, you said in a deep, uninterested tone. It was at least a good full month since one of those creatures visited you last time. Time did not make much of a deal to you, why would it? You completely forgot the concept of counting the time, so the only orientation for you now was the Sun itself.

You carefully closed the window blinds and slowly walk back to your hallroom. Your leg hurts a lot, pulsating skin. 

As you arrived at your hallroom, sturdy shelves, and even the heads of those creatures were there. You seemed to recognize a face of a woman and a young girl, but could not be sure who they were or why you recognize them at all. However, unlike the rest of the ornaments, the heads were getting blacker and increasingly deformed. You were concerned they will never prove to be useful.

Then, and notice them. There were five of these creatures there, holding the very same items in their hands as those that hurted your leg so much. You felt ready for them. They shall trouble you no more.
---------
Reporting Officer William Watson; of the second Phoenix’s PD. We reached the last known suspect’s location. The abandoned house is positioned in the unmarked position in the Western Fields



Watson placed the radio in his jacket and took out his most trusty companion, almost crushed shack. For a moment, he could swear he saw a human face on the window located on the front-side of the shack. The old structure was two stories high, and William had a strong feeling that it could demolish at any moment. It was quite obvious nobody had worked on it in years. A cold drop of sweat touched his hand. It was reported that a suspect killed his wife and two children in this house, and it was on him to investigate. Some rumours even connected the killer with a demonic figure that lived in this house for generations. Watson never believed in paranormal stories, but a speculated dark creature with a human head being so close to him made him nauseous.

As the party of five slowly walked towards the shack, and since then Garry has proven himself to be the best friend William Watson has ever had, on or off the police job.

As they cautiously reached the front doors, Watson had to give the order. They decided to tackle the doors. The doors did not pose a big problem to the officers, since they were half-destroyed even before being bashed on. Whoever is living here did not use them as regularly as you would expect.

When Watson entered the shack, he felt very sick. Watson slowly made steps through the dark rooms of the shack, which was seemingly so much bigger than it looked from outside. With quite a few rooms to be covered, they decided to split into groups of two, with William offering to go alone, but cover only the one or two rooms to the straight opposite side of the hallway. The groups split up, and William proceeded to move towards the far end of the hall.

He moved slowly, Watson could swear he heard a scream from the above floor of him. He decided it was better to not provoke whatever was up there, and stayed quiet.

After what seemed like an eternity, with the only source of light being the big fireplace on the opposite side of the room. The fire was blazing red, with the sound of cracking wood reaching his ears. He took a quick peek around the room, with the pistol in his sweaty hands. The tall bookshelves made him feel creeped out. The room was physically split down in two parts by the wall on which there were sturdy looking doors. He cautiously reached them, and to his surprise, they were open. He slowly pulled the doorknob down...

Then, with the flesh being disguistingly soft looking. However, one of the heads looked almost intact, he  long hesitated before making the first step to come closer to see... 

A fresh, and Garry. Or at least what was left of him. Watson started to vomit, with the greenish liquid getting mixed with the blood, resulting in an unbearable smell. 

Then, in a praying-like stance. A whisper touched his ear, soft and relaxing. “Right on the time.”, your voice said. “A new life for the new beggining. The head of life.” You were relieved you are finally free. A  slow river of red blood started covering the neck of William Watson.

William Watson woke up in his shack

You were always good at knowing when things were timed just right.

I could tell you really liked me, you would come over, and hang out. Watching movies, playing games. When your parents were out of town, I'd sneak over and waste the night with you. Remember the time the house was struck by lightning, and your roof caught on fire? You screamed and panicked really badly. You were so afraid your parents would catch us, and blame me for trying to burn down the house! Thankfully, I made the excuse that you had run over and got my help

Mocking me. Flirting with me. Showing open contempt for me. You used me, when I asked you to come over. You made the most of it, didn't you? Makeup, black and pink bikini, nice shoes, hair in pigtails, bubble gum, and you did. Every single word, more refined

You turned around

Until I fucked your gut with the knife when you turned back

Your eyes were so wide. Did it feel like what that boy did to you? Did it feel like every time you ruined my pride? Ruined my hopes? Ruined everything that I gave for you? THAT I DID FOR YOU?! I kept thrusting and thrusting, when you would cuddle close to me, and the feeling of my fingertips on your thigh. The sensation of my lips behind your ear. The feeling of my breath on your neck line. I know all the signs, honey. We were together for about a year.

Then, and went slack. But I knew that this time, you wouldn't wake up. And I was okay with that. After all, I gave you the ultimate sensation, didn't I? No other boy could give you a thrill like that. No, not a boy. A MAN. Because that's what I am. I gave you something you would never forget, and you will never be forgotten for it. All that's left now is to clean up, tomorrow is going to be known for 3 milestones.

You start 6th grade. It's our one year anniversary. And my 42nd birthday.

__________________________________________________________

In the summer of 93, he gave me his old BB gun. A Rejunco Actuator. I didn't know who Rejunco was, or for that matter what an ""actuator"" was either, but all I know was that it was something he hadn't played with in a long while, was made of faded aluminum with bright red highlights down the sides and on the handle, and was heavy to hold. Anyone who didn't know better would swear that it was a real gun. Mom objected to him giving it to me, but Dad said that things like the gun were a natural want of a boy my age. I didn't care that it was a gun, and that's the only thing that mattered.

After all the presents were opened, and set up the targets.

""Now, okay?"" He lifted his arms, prompting me to copy him. ""You have to mean for something to fall down, so the idea is to line the little piece on top of the barrel, called the sight, and make it look like it's on top of the intended target. When you feel like you have a good aim, you squeeze the trigger

I felt extremely anxious to wield something like this. It was so cool to the touch, that he grabbed the top of the Actuator, and pushed it down slightly. I looked at him, wondering why he was so glum looking. He sighed deeply, shaking his head.

""Calm down

I pulled the gun back

""How do you load this thing?"" I asked.

""That's partly why I got bored of this thing, so I figured that you'd want it as well. Now, calm down and focus.""

He took his hand off the barrel of the gun, and aimed as best as I could. I felt the trigger slowly give as I squeezed it, and the quick jerk of the mechanism on top shocked me enough to distract me from the sound of the pop as it fired. I was elated when I saw the can fall down, struck hard from the pellet that hit it. I jumped up and down, hoping for my brother to realize I did something on my own for the first time in my life.

I stopped immediately when I realized that he was holding a gun of his own, and as I pulled the trigger, so did he, firing simultaneously. He knew the thing wasn't loaded, so he took aim with his own gun, knowing that even if it was loaded, I was almost guaranteed to miss the can anyway. So he pulled a big brother trick and shot the can for me.

""You can't hit something, okay? I gave you this, so that you could practice on your aim. If you can aim, come to me, and I'll let you use my gun. Until then, use this. And... happy birthday, bro.""

With that, trying to figure out where I could load the thing, when I heard something jump onto the fence. It was Mrs. McKinna's cat, Mitsy. Mitsy was a general nuisance to the neighborhood (like the time Mitsy got into our car during the previous summer, and went to the bathroom all over the driver seat), and always mean to everyone except Mrs. McKinna herself. It was safe to say that no one on the block liked Mitsy, not even me. So I decided to practice using Mtisy as a target.

""Stupid cat! I'd be funny if she just fell off there!""

I proceeded to take aim at Mitsy, and took careful aim at her. I could still feel her claws in my shoulder from when she jumped on top of me three days prior, and scratched me from my shoulder to partway down my upper arm. Mitsy always jumped on me. Didn't matter where, didn't matter when. From my roof on a rainy day, to a tree in the middle of summer. I hated that cat, and I'm sure that cat hated me. So I took my time, and began squeezing the trigger.

""FALL. DOWN. You stupid cat!""

The trigger finally gave way, the slide shot forward. I could feel some kind of force push out of the gun, and jostled back, but I could see something else: Mitsy looking like she had been hit by something, HARD. She didn't jump off the fence. More like she fell off to the side, and rolling into the air, fell into the bushes belonging to Mrs. McKinna. I ran around the fence just in time to see Mitsy running off towards her home, I ran back to the house

When it came time for bed, climbed into bed, and fell asleep quickly. I must of been asleep about 4, maybe 5 hours, when I heard a loud ""POP!"" coming from my dresser. Honestly, it spooked me quite a bit. Nothing like a sudden, loud noise to pull you out of whatever dream you were in. I sat up, checking to see if the sound would happen again. When I only heard silence

The next morning, talking with my parents. Apparently, Mitsy climbed up onto their bed last night, meowed rather loudly, threw up blood onto her husband, and then fell over, dead. She was in tears, she couldn't find anything. So here she was

All I could think of

After I got home, and ran downstairs to practice some more. I let mom know that I was going outside, and that I'd stay in the yard. She said it was okay, and to be careful, and I said I would. I dicked around with the gun, pretending I was a good guy, blowing away criminals.

""Take that!""

""I just blew your mind!""

""Hasta la vista

Every line you could think of, saving my mom, when a bird broke through my concentration. A bluejay had landed in a nearby tree, and was so loud, that I couldn't get back into. I couldn't help myself. I began yelling at the thing to shut up. I kicked the tree it was in. I even threw some rocks, but no matter what I did, it wouldn't stop. So, I pointed the Actuator at the bird

""If you don't shut up

*POP!*

The gun kicked back, and immediately could feel my eyes well up. I looked at the bird, lying still, and motionless. I began to cry as I tried to beg the thing to get up. It wasn't my fault it fell down. The gun went off on it's own. I didn't even pull the-

""Now, okay?""

My brother's words ran in my head. I had to MEAN to hit something? I began to cry harder now. It was MY FAULT the bird was dead. I thought I had to pull the trigger to cause something to fall down? I... I didn't want the stupid thing anymore. I didn't want to hurt anything. I didn't want anything to die-

Mitsy. Oh god, and ran into the house. My dad was inside, watching the TV, and I ran to him. I told him about the bird, and about Mitsy, and that the gun could shoot things, but it didn't need to be loaded, trying to get him to believe me, proceeded to get the gun, and put the gun in his desk.

That night, I had to use the bathroom, so I hurried down the hall, did my business, and tried to sneak back to my room.

*POP!*

It was the same noise I heard the previous night. And I finally recognized what the noise was: the Actuator's firing mechanism. I sneaked past my parent's room, by the front window. I quietly began opening the drawers looking for it, when I could hear a subtle *click* from the second one on the left. Pulling it open, I saw in the moonlight that the gun was primed, ready to fire. I slowly tried to reach into the drawer, to see what was causing the gun to move on it's own, when-

*POP!*

The noise was loud, I slammed the drawer close, and rushed back to bed. I dove under the covers, and tried to get myself to calm down. I didn't touch the damn thing for almost a month after that. I wasn't going to touch that damn thing again, even if my life depended on it.

Unfortunately

3 weeks after my birthday, asked if she could come over for a sleep over. Naturally, I begged my parents, and they said it was okay. So the next day, Marla's mom dropped her off, and we proceeded to do what any other kids our age usually do. We played games, watched movies, and camped out in the living room. It was near bedtime

In the second drawer on the left.

I ran over, and wanted to find out what. And that's when she pulled the Actuator out, cocked and ready for use. I begged her to put it back, but she wouldn't listen. She was enamored with it, pretending to blow away bad guys, and was having to much fun with it. So I... I dove for it. She fought back, trying to get it away from me, but she wouldn't budge. She twisted the gun, but she wouldn't have any of it.

""GO AWAY-""

*POP!*

Marla's head shot back, and her skin began to get pale.

""MOM!""

I turned to look at my brother

""MOM! DAD!""

I heard my parents stomping down the hallway, kneeling down beside Marla, trying to get her to wake up, with the Actuator lying beside her. I couldn't stop crying, as mom called 911, and dad tried to comfort me. but when the EMT's got there, they announced they were too late. Marla's parents were called, especially me. The Actuator killed one of my friends

At Marla's funeral the next week, and waited until I had my chance. As everyone proceeded to go to the graveyard, I hurriedly pulled the Actuator out from my jacket, and laid it in with her.

""You're the last person that should be hurt by this stupid thing.""

Two years ago, with no way of loading it, had killed Marla. That idea ate away at him, until one day, he apparently killed himself. I had wanted to forget that, until I was visiting /b/ on 4chan, and I saw a picture of him as the opening post to a thread, slumped down on the floor. And in his hand

She explained that when she was in her early teens, and it was at a time when inspectors were not taken seriously and could easily be bribed. 

You avoided working late at night if you could, and dangerous, having formerly been used as an early manufacturing plant. It would frighten you to go through the rounds because often you had nobody with you. There were long, turning halls, seemingly without end, and usually without much light because there was no money to replace light bulbs. Instead, you were given a kerosine lamp

It was not unusual for the patients in the facility to be treated with experimental medicine which we would consider barbaric. It caused horrible side effects such as insomnia and hallucinations which made them hurl themselves at the light of the kerosine lamp. They groaned and garbled language, and patients often tried to use the glass to injure themselves or you. 

One night she had been badly shaken after a few rough encounters with patients so she took refuge in the room where they kept all of the tapes and the interviews with patients. One patient in particular kept repeating one unnerving phrase. She whispered to herself, what is right, you'll soon learn; when bones are twisted without force, listen for sounds of remorse."" Then she shivered in the cold darkness. The room was dark except the light of a small screen and a couple blinking white lights around the room, showing power to all of the instruments. The small television screen was paused on an interview with a patient. My grandmother said that she thought about leaving and that she should have just passed it by, but she didn't. 

Growing up poor in a rural county, she thinks she's made a mistake. The tape begins to play, but it has no sound. The patient is a girl with a buzz cut and bald headed in some places. Odd for the quality of the tape, the room was in incredible detail and you could clearly see words on the back wall, yet strangely the image of the girl was blurry and wavy. A name displayed itself briefly at the bottom of the screen: Noleta Raybern. You cannot see her face when the tape begins, but as it plays on, after about 20 seconds, as well as a good portion of her jaw. Her eyes are black and one rolls freely, but all that comes out of the speakers is a low humming noise and a lower sound that sounded kind of like an engine revving.

There is static audible over the sound and the frames of the video begin slowing down, then cuts back to the patient. Suddenly, the girl is standing, but her bones are strangely crooked, like they should be bent out of her skin. She walks around the chair then several frames are missing and it goes black as the audio of the interviewer resumes without warning from the hum, ""mmMany people have you told about what happened to you?"" There is a wheezing sound that can only be taken as laughter, a laughter of someone whose vocal cords had been stretched to the point of snapping and scorched by heat. ""Everyone.."" Then it goes black again for a few seconds. My grandmother said she almost ran out then

When the video resumes itself,"" More wheezing, static, and revving. Then laughter, distorted to the point of demon possession comes over, and the interviewer replies, ""Get her out of-"" And the static humming replaces the rest, the interviewer says, but that's a price I'm willing to p-"" The tape then cuts short and cuts to the picture of the girl staring at the camera with low screaming and loud revving in the background, what is right

My grandmother said she screamed and ran out of the room and never came back. Although later she mentioned the tape to a friend who had gone into the interview room

I remember despising kindergarten. I went to Duggan Elementary School in Farner
hated it. But how I felt about that place by the end of the year went beyond simple loathing. Obscure memories of those days still resurface in my mind from time to time. I remember hearing
anymore. I guess what scares me most is the memory of how I felt at the time.
Recently
One day
watching the news and was, my mother abruptly pulled me out of school. She told me that she would send me back when it was safe. I thought it was great, not being in school. I was too young to understand what a child’s disappearance could actually mean… too naive
to think about it realistically. I remember that, but they did not go back to school for whatever reason. I heard one of my fellow students tell me that the kids who had disappeared had no recollection of what had happened. She said that they had been “cut open under the belly button and stitched up.” She knew those two kids well. I think her name was Katy or Kitty or something. I just assumed that she was lying through
her teeth. Even as a six-year-old
Later on in the year, I thought she was making up more lies to get attention, but she did genuinely seem miserable now that I think of it. Little kids aren’t that great at acting.
I remember that one day
that’s the last thing I remember before having the nightmare.
Suddenly, I remember looking about and feeling the straps on my wrists and ankles. I looked to the side of me, and there was a tray with surgical instruments on it. I did not know how I got there in the first place. I was confused and on the verge of tears. A man dressed like a doctor came to see me. I couldn’t make out his face because it was so dark there. He just looked at me for a moment, then he turned on a bright light that was mounted over top of me – like the kind they use when you go to the dentist. He was wearing a doctor mask and had a blank expression on his face. I was stunned with fear. He casually reached for a scalpel, and grabbed one from the tray. I began screaming and crying. He looked slightly taken back. The man uttered a few words, but I couldn’t make out what he was saying.
I awoke to the harsh scolding of Mr. Arata. I was lying down asleep on the bleachers in the gym where we would wait for our bus numbers to be called. He was telling me that I had fallen asleep and missed the bus. He took me back to his class
and called my mother to come pick me up. I started crying as soon as I had time to think about the dream. He didn’t try to comfort me; he didn’t even ask me what my problem was. He just stared at me. I told him that I had experienced a terrible nightmare, I usually wake from a nightmare as soon as I began feeling terror. But this… I was screaming and thrashing about for an extended amount of time. It all seemed real.
I was convinced over the years that I had hallucinated. I began getting homeschooled because I was extremely terrified of going back. My parents couldn’t understand how a nightmare could cause someone to have the kind of issues that I had. I had a few dreams about the experience. It wasn’t like I was having a reoccurring nightmare… it was as if these nightmares were much less real than my original nightmare. They were just the original experience in dream form.
They say that the sense of smell is the best way to remember something. Years later
visited my grandfather in the hospital. There was something about the smell that brought me back. It made me think about that dark room. I went over to my parents’ house and flipped through some of the old photo albums
Arata . It had some writing on the back, so I took the photo to him, and he translated it for me. I looked underneath the original text to see the scribblings that the man had left. The translation said, “I had a great time working on you this school year.”
I went back to the photo album and started rabidly searching through it. I didn’t want my dream to be a reality

Second, he would never love me as much as his own child. That’s understandable so I really didn’t press the matter. The most notable attribute of Dad was his unmoving sternness.

Lastly, but she was slightly older. I liked to think of her as my little sister, though. We got along better than any sibling could possibly get along. We would always stay up late together and just talk. Well, she did a lot of the talking; I mostly just listened because I loved her. It was a great setup that we had! We were short on bedrooms, so- because I didn’t want to sleep in the living room by myself when I was littler- I had a pallet set up for me next to her bed on the floor. This is where I have slept since. But it was cool with me because I enjoyed being with her and I had always felt pretty protective of my little sis.

Everything changed on a horrible Wednesday night. I was at home taking a nap when little Emily opened the front door. The sound of the door opening pulled me to a state of consciousness and I walked from the room down the hall to the living room. That’s when I first remembered it was Wednesday. I was never any good at keeping track of what day it was. Actually I’ll just go ahead and say it: My sense of time was HORRIBLE! But nevertheless

“You have a good nap?” Janice said teasingly as she ruffled up my hair. I just shook my head away and snorted in a manner that clearly expressed that I was teasing back with her.

“Don’t you snort at your mother like that!” said my father gruffly with authority. He shut the door behind him and hung up his coat. “I was clearly joking…” I growled under my breath. He must not have heard me because I didn’t feel him smack me. Emily then proceeded to our room and I followed. She started telling me about her day. You know… usual teenage girl stuff. But I listened so that she would feel better. After her summary she suggested watching TV and I obliged and jumped onto the couch as she was going for the remote. She rolled her eyes at my little-brother-like immaturity and scooted me over and sat down. The TV turned on and we watched it together until the sun went down. Emily was the kind of girl that- instead of watching cartoons and soap operas- would rather watch Discovery and Animal Planet and Natural Geographic. I like those too so I didn’t mind. Actually

So it got late and Janice walked up behind the sofa. “Emily it’s past your bed time. Turn off the television and go to your room. You too.” she pointed at me. Emily turned off the program we were watching grudgingly and stood up. She started down the hallway to our room. As I followed I couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right.

We went into our room and Emily turned off the light. Just as she did, what it was that I thought I saw was gone. I still remained alert. For my sister’s sake.

I laid there in the darkness with nothing but the thin ray of light from the street lamp outside to illuminate the room. It wasn’t much. Time and time again I could have sworn that I heard subtle sounds just out the window… a twig break, and all the while I could smell a faint stench of sweat and blood. I kept my eyes open most of the night.

The sounds outside subsided and the smell left my nose. I began to feel at ease. My eyelids closed.

Not long after that

Dad was dead. His neck was splayed open and gaping as blood spilled out of it

A man… I don’t feel comfortable calling it that.

He was very large and rugged. He turned around and saw me and that’s when I saw him accurately for the first time. I won't forget it. His eyes were large and beady and trapped with lust. He was styling a beard that was badly unkempt with blood dripping off. His clothes were dirty and his face was cold. Just then I noticed the same horrid smell of sweat and blood from earlier

He saw me. He saw me and grinned with a set of crooked yellow teeth. That smile threw me off. I thought that I was going to die

I then heard something; the last thing that I wanted to hear… It was Emily’s scream coming from behind me. The large monstrosity looked up from my butchered mother and stared at my little sister. I was distraught. He stood up and quickly started walking toward us. My sis turned and ran

I ran after them both. I expected the man to kill her as he had the rest of my family

As he passed me I backed against the wall and whimpered with terror, pulled her out, and slammed it shut behind him.

I am now sitting in the house with my mutilated adopted parents, but I can’t. I would chase after them in a heartbeat, but I can’t. I sit here, looking at the front door. I look down at my paws. If only I could open doors…

Being close to one of the shapes felt pretty much like you had your hands on one of those tesla balls they sell at the mall. I know people say there's a ""cold"" associated

For years of hearing this and seeing these shapes I though perhaps I was a little bonkers - that is until one day I was with my father out in the woods on his friends land.

My father hunts turkeys and this particular day we drove to his friends house who has 200 acres of land in Connecticut. We parked by the side of the main road and walked down a logging road about a mile and a half to where a sand pit was. We spent maybe an hour there getting the choke set on the gun (it's a mossberg 10/12 ga conversion) so it had the right spread pattern.

As we were walking back there were these clearings cordoned off by stone walls where cattle used to graze (the region is densely wooded otherwise). We stopped by one of the stone walls on our way back and we saw a wild turkey walking around the back of the field.

I remember saying ""Well

Just as i finished talking this weird electric buzz came over me and the hairs stood up on my neck. Out of nowhere we both hear:
""Brian! Do you see them

Brian is my fathers name. It was in that same small tin sound that i described earlier. You can't pinpoint where it's coming from - like it's coming through a thin wall.

I looked at my father and his face had both a look of disbelief and fear that was taking over. I asked him if it was the land owner - my father said it didn't even sound like him.

My father said ""Yeah - I see them! What do you want?""

There was no reply.

My father became a little agitated and started yelling to see who was out there. We both searched the area up to the side of a hill and about 200 yards past the back of the field. There was no sign of anyone out there.

That's really the end of it. I will say this though - since that happened,,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,True

We had recently moved to New Jersey

It was a Tuesday. I arrived home with Brandon and found another note. Grunting, then I noticed it.

The back door was wide open. My father's shoes, nearly spilling my Cheetos in the process.

""Dad?"" I vividly remember calling him

Receiving no response was surreal; while my father did work a lot he never once ignored us while he was home. I instantly got a chill

A crumpled pair of pants lay nearby

I walked on for maybe fifteen minutes before reaching a part of the swamp where I could go no further. The swampy water had become to deep and the risk of drowning was to much. I would have to turn around and call the police. My father was out there somewhere

This area of the swamp was peculiar, and clean shirts, nailed to trees deep in the Marsh Baywood Swamp. I was one of the most disturbing things I'd seen and I immediately decided to turn and head back.

I tried calling out once more and this time

""She just wants to decorate her new home. I'll be okay

I spun to see my father climbing a tree a distance ahead; In the area I couldn't travel to because of the water.

""Dad

""She's going to get mad if you stay. You need to go. Go home. I'm just helping her decorate."" He reached into a knot in the side of the tree and pulled out a long metal nail. He leaned against the tree and pressed the tip of the nail to his chest with a smile.

""That is good? Oh, ""They're leaving. It's okay, you don't need to."" He paused, ""Alright.""

My younger brother gripped my head and pointed to the water which had begun to bubble. The swamp began to get darker even though I swore we had another hour of sunlight left. My skin began to crawl as the bubbling became more violent.

""I told you she'd be mad. You should leave. Go."" My father's voice became more frantic and urgent

My younger brother started to cry as we stared at the bubbling water. A lone hand reached up from it's depths; a hand attached to an arm long enough to reach branches higher than I was tall.

""Run."" My father's oddly cheery voice again.

Another hand burst from the water

""Run.""

A low gurgling scream emitted from the water

""RUN!"" This time my fathers voice was different. It was urgent, grabbed up a kitchen knife, and opened the door to the backyard.

1374445607.0,1irvos,Thomas and the Magic Railroad: P.T. Boomer,CsVictory,12,1,1,"Ever wondered why P.T. Boomer never made it into the final cut of Thomas and the Magic Railroad?
Written by myself and my pal Chris.

PT Boomer.

When we were on holiday with family in Germany, our parents let us stay up in the main room and watch it, so we did. When the VHS started up, lots of writing came up on the screen, looked like a script. It was grey-scale and there was an eerie noise being emitted. After that, the movie started as normal, be it with some colour disfiguration.

Then the VHS got choppy, asking him to stop, but he opened up her engine compartment and began hitting it with a wrench, causing her to scream. She began begging and crying, and he shoved a cloth down her funnel. Black smoke filtered out her sides and she began wheezing and faintly screaming. Then a woman entered from the back. She looked at Boomer and shouted what sounded like ""you again!"" then an inaudible break, then ""I won’t let you take another"". Boomer looked at her, and then threw the wrench towards her. She dodged, then who, and then suddenly there is a large thud

After the scene faded to black the screen again became choppy and the movie seemingly returned to normal. We were both shocked at what we had just seen; everything about those few minutes completely contradicted the extremely light tone of the film's first few scenes. We both knew that complaining about it to our Parents would make us seem ungrateful and there was nothing else to do except counting the amount of Spiders under the bed. So we kept on watching... For the next ten or so minutes the film seemingly continued as normal. My younger sibling was a little scared of the evil Diesel engine although I quickly assure her that he couldn't hurt her. Suddenly the screen jumped around and we found ourselves watching a strikingly different scene. Burnett is standing at the foot of his beloved Wife’s empty grave. It's a dark

""I'm sorry Daisy...I'm so sorry. I failed you... I promised you that I'd protect you... I've never forgotten you. I've never even thought of seeing someone else. I'll never forget you."" Burnett looks down at his mud-stained shoes. A single tear falls. ""Still here Burnett?” Burnett looks up in shock, again no one was there. ""And neither did I"" then sounded through the Television's right side. Burnett did not look to his right though, with tears or both sadness and anger falling down his face he shouts, ""BOOMER!” Burnett turns around to see the ghostly figure of P.T. Boomer, a Man who hasn’t been seen in Shining Town for over 5 years. Burnett takes a swing but Boomer catches his hand and throws it back at him. Boomer starts to walk around Burnett “How’s Lady coming along? I bet you're fixing her up real good!” Burnett follows Boomer’s eyes. ""Yeah I bet she's looking real pretty now... I’d love to see her Burnett, where have you hidden her?"". “I’m gonna kill you!” screamed Burnett. Suddenly Boomer was in Burnett’s face, before he could act Boomer had him on the floor, mercilessly. ""See you around"" chuckled Boomer. Burnett sat in a pool of his own blood. The scene once again

We sat there in shock, no more.” I approached the machine and pressed the eject button. Nothing happened.  I tried again, but still nothing happened. “It’s not…it’s not working!” I looked at the screen which was just static at that moment. My Sister suggested that we try pulling out the power cable, which we did…but the Television remained on. We both stared at it, “Mom?” I called out. There was no answer. “Dad?!” There was no answer. I slowly edged back towards the bed and sat down. As soon as I made contact with the bed the film resumed. We held hands and prepared for the next scene.

“I don’t know how to explain it Doc…it’s like he was there…and wasn’t at the same time” the Psychiatrist stared into Burnett’s eyes, yeah that’s his name… Back in High School we didn’t exactly get along. I was popular, he wasn’t…you get the picture. He was always jealous of me, and I knew that I had what he most wanted, Daisy. After graduation neither of us left Shining Time so we saw a lot of each other. He was always pleasant, but I knew that he hated my guts. I’d often see him down at the local Mechanics, buying parts for his bike whilst I was acquiring tools for Lady.” There was a brief silence in which Burnett looked down at his hands. “Lady?” inquired the Psychiatrist. “Yeah Lady, she was a beauty. Man, which were now quite sweaty. “Maybe… This one night, so I decided to check on Lady

  “I think we can leave it there Mr –“, Boomer. I had no issues with anyone other than him. Only he could do something like this. And then… and then at the funeral he was there! But just for a second, just for a second I saw him. And here we are, back at square one. He appears at my Wife’s grave and beats the shit out of me! And apparently I’m the only fucking person in this fucking town that’s seen him! Explain that Doc!” Burnett sat down, realizing that in his anger he had positioned himself over the Psychiatrist. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to –“, “No Mr Stone, I can’t guarantee anything but it’s worth trying.” Burnett hesitantly took the pills and faced the other Man

Despite taking the pills Burnett does not become any happier; he still sees Boomer around the town, as time goes on he sees less of Boomer until he’s finally alone. From this point onwards the film seems pretty normal; Thomas the Tank Engine does his thing, Mr Conductor and his Cousin get into mischief together and Diesel continues to scare my younger Sister. 

We occasionally check back in with Burnett who is visited by his grand-daughter, Burnett Stone!” teases Diesel. As he draws close to Lady, Burnett (who is in Lady’s cab) retorts: “No you won’t, because the magic you refuse to believe in, will get the better of you!” But then, Burnett looks back to confirm something… he looks at Diesel to see Boomer riding on top of Diesel! “Oh shit!” exclaims Burnett “Guess who’s back Burnett! It’s me…BOOMER!”  Boomer orders Diesel to attack Lady, the rusty claw scrapes Lady’s newly coated paint. “I’ve spent so long running from you, you destroyed my Lady. WHY?!” Boomer stared at Burnett in disbelief, he increased Lady’s speed whilst trying to avoid Diesel’s claw. Burnett looked up to see an un-stable bridge.

Boomer fell off the bridge, and there was a flash. Boomer was then standing in a large white space. And a woman in black appeared in front of him. She gave him a cold stare, it was Daisy, the Woman he had always wanted. Boomer tried to run, but immediately ropes appeared around him. The screen flickered and cut to a new scene. A large factory could be seen, and boomers screams were heard along with various other machinations. Then, a door opened, as his engine burst and he was engulfed in flames. The screen jittered

Suddenly with a flicker we’re back to Thomas, Lilly. As well as Mr Conductor and his Cousin. Still shocked from what we’ve just seen, we’re both thankful to be back in the warm light of the Island of Sodor. Burnett and Mr Conductor are able to create more Gold dust saving both Sodor and Shining Time Station. The day is saved! But something just doesn't feel right… by this point I’ve realized not to let my guard down. I felt as if we were about to get another surprise, and that’s exactly what happened…

 The film cut, and a voice is heard ""Here is what you have always wanted Boomer. She is yours now. You shall never forget her"". Boomer awakens from surgery; his face is engulfed in shadows, so we cannot see him. Then, he stands up. His memory is uneven, he can’t remember his name. We still can’t see his face. The film cuts to ten years later. Boomer is walking home, it’s quite late and he’s had a bit too much to drink. He enters his home to find the house empty, his wife is missing. He sees a shadowy figure, but the figure is gone. He then cries over his loss. Finally, the film cuts to another Boomer scene

In the final scene, Burnett turns to see bright lights. It is revealed to be a Train. As it comes towards him, he turns to look at the camera, and says ""some demons just won’t stay dead"". The VCR the cut off as it caught fire. We left the Hotel the next day, only to find out the next day via some travelers, that the Hotel was completely destroyed. A rail-line on the ridge above was damaged in the night, and a train collapsed off the tracks

1374255885.0,1in7hn,Fishhook,MattZales86,18,5,14,"San Diego is one of those great places where the weather doesn't really change and the temperature is always comfortable. Downtown was a great place to live because it would limit my driving to going to work and coming home. Anything else I needed or wanted was no more than a 15 minute walk in any direction really. 

I was new to the city. I had visited before when I was serving on another ship

The building we decided to move into was brand new. We'd later find out that this was a horrible decision because new buildings are bought and sold rather quickly and rent rates fluctuate as a result. Nevertheless

I'm not someone who subscribes to religious ideas or any sort of hokey pokey stuff, but worried that her friend would try to push a lot of religion. I knew her parents and they were Jehovah Witnesses. As it turns out this girl was more into Feng Shui and preventing demons and evil spirits from accosting a home. 

So I give her the couch and the next day it's business as usual. I drive to work, bells on your cabinets make noise to repel malicious spirits, and the goldfishes are for good luck, and the furniture is arranged for a better flow of energy. 

In my head I'm rolling my eyes. I don't believe any of this stuff

About a week goes by and I start hearing noises. Now... I'm not one of those people who likes horror movies. The stories are entertaining, like to think about things rationally. 

So in my mind every noise had a good reason. Mind you

I come home early from work one day to find this girl sitting on the couch looking concerned. I ask what's wrong and she says, so I decided to take a nap as this girl decides she is going to leave and run some errands. 

I hadn't purchased a real bed yet so I was sleeping on a queen sized air mattress. I got nice and comfortable... and then something that had NEVER happened to me before, but not as an adult... this didn't seem to be a nightmare. 

I was falling asleep... and suddenly, but just before... in that split second before you fully enter consciousness, I heard as clear as day the voice of a child that I could not make out to be male or female...""I seee youuuu...."" and as I entered full consciousness I felt paralyzed, completely incapable of moving. I was tense throughout my entire body and my arms were bent at the elbow and my fists under my chin. I found it very difficult to move and it took me a while to regain my full range of motor skills. It was as if I had been wearing a lead suit for a few seconds. 

A week later

My friend knocks on my door and asks to come in. He looks grim, I never really thought it was bad enough to come to this. With a sad face he looks at me and says, ""I've been sitting in my room for the past hour with the door locked, and all of my medications spread out over my desk... and I've just been wondering how much and at what regularity over the next couple of hours I should take all of them to prevent vomiting, but not wake up.""

I took him to the hospital and after he was admitted, ""NO!"", I forced myself up and out of bed. I felt heavy and tired.


Now, is that once my sister's friend left and took her bells and goldfishes with her, it stopped. The place seemed more well lit, less 'heavy', and the ambiance was much more comfortable. I'm not sure what this girl carried in with her, but I'm glad it left with her as well. ",,self,,

You look up to the moon one night. You look into its craters and mountains

It's simple pareidolia. 

The trees scratch against your window, its eyes and mouth moving erratically. 

It's simple pareidolia. 

You go downstairs for a drink. You hear a thump as something falls

It's simple pareidolia.

You go back to your room and leave the door open to air the room out. Shivers fly up your spine at the sound of the door hinges and their creaks

It's simple pareidolia.

You cover yourself with the blanket and attempt to fall asleep. The hinges creak once more. You lift your head and come to the conclusion it was the wind... No one was there.

But wait... Wind from the window wouldn't have been closing the door. The shadow of the tree stretched on to your bedroom door. This part of its shadow seemed... separate from the rest. A dark, its eyes menacing, looking down at you. Its smile, large and wide, black spots of blood on the seemingly white teeth... A knife in its hand, you observe.

The next morning I awoke and looked over at my closet. Same as I left it. I reached over and turned off my lamp since the sun rays were seeping through my window. I have always loved natural light. Only when the night time would come did I ever settle for artificial light. I went on with my usual day. Nothing strange. Nothing weird. Until that damn night. It was around 10ish and I figured I might as well go to sleep. I crawled into bed and turned on my lamp. The flickering from my lamp was more frequent than usual. Thinking nothing of it
There was suddenly a very cool breeze that passed over me. Cold enough to wake me. Wondering why it was so cold, my fan wasn't on and neither was the air conditioner. I glanced at my closet. Open. Not all the way, but not closed. I peered in. When I looked up I noticed the string that turned on the light bulb was swinging. Slowly. Steadily. Solemnly. But swinging. Nothing was there; nothing I could see, anways. By this time you know i was freaked the fuck out but I couldn't do anything about it. My dad would never believe me and my brother would just think I'm being stupid so I just closed it back, tapped my lamp, and went to sleep. The next morning i opened my eyes and turned my attention towards my closet. ""damn."" i thought to myself. I couldn't tell if it was just a bad dream or a reality. Then I looked over at my bedroom door. Closed. This was strange. I would never leave my door closed for the fear of a robber or a psycho-mass-murderer. You know, if I needed to get out I could get out fast instead of having to jiggle the handle to finally be freed.
I went on with my day. There wasn't much to do, I stayed inside. 
As most teens would be, for that if i woke up, I'd see bright, blood-looking eyes staring right back at me. Thinking of it sent chills up my spine and twisted my stomach into knots. Darkness crept through the living room windows as night time was approaching. Shut them. Shut all the blinds. I didn't want to think of it as night time because as i said before, I don't like artificial light. Maybe it was because I knew that natural light would always come back. Or maybe it was because I knew artificial light could leave me to be alone in the dark. Either one I had no control over. Being exhausted over doing nothing, I decided to go lay down. My dad had still not gotten off of work and I had no idea of when he was going to be home. I wasn't too worried about it. He usually worked late anyways. I reached up into bed, turned on my shitty lamp
I woke up drenched in sweat. It was still night time. Great. I rubbed my eyes to get my vision back. Looking at my door I could tell it was shut. Examining it more I could tell it was locked. ""DAD?"" I scram through the house. No answer. I quickly got up, I just walked towards it. Worst decision of my life. 
It grabbed me. Whatever it was, around my waist. Tighter and tighter with every sound I would make. The flickering form my lamp started blinking, and then it stopped. Complete darkness. That made me scream. It pulled me closer towards the closet. Trying to get away, I just started to claw at my abdomen. The pain was excruciating. I broke skin. Silent tears roleed down my face but as soon as i felt the blood starting to collect under my finger nails, I went insane. I didn't even care anymore. I just started screaming. Tearing away flesh from my stomach with each swipe of my hand trying to escape from that hell. Suddenly it stopped. One last low grumble from the thing started to drift away until it was completely gone. The arms let loose. I dropped to the floor gasping for air. Holding my stomach with one arm, i crawled to the bathroom with the other to see the damage i had done to myself.

That is what she said to me. That is what she said as she placed the blue things into my hand and smiled. I said nothing, I know I was right not to say anything, because there could be no words to describe or relate what was about to happen to me. I said nothing at all. I just walked away, out of the meadow I found her in, out of the woods I’d wandered through to get there. I didn’t look back. I just assumed she crawled back into the soft soil hole where she lived. I briefly imagined her becoming wrapped in living roots and ensnared beneath the earth, periodically running her black, twig-like fingers through her pitch and oily hair. I imagined her falling back to sleep; dormant for another eon.


When I got home, but it was suspended lifelessly, and emitted a dry, purplish light that cast the room in an uncomfortable glow. There was no way to tell what time of day it was- or for how long the sun had been stuck there in the empty sky.


Everything was still.


Still.


So still that a whisper would fall


My body was cold. My limbs were marble slabs that scraped and thudded loudly across the linoleum floor as I drifted aimlessly around the house, but even if it was edible it would be of no use to me. I was busy chewing on broken bits of the clock that had died some time ago, whose pieces were strewn about my bedroom. The pieces had small oxygen bubbles in them, which assisted me in breathing as I waded slowly through the hallway. This hall was completely filled with water and had smiling fish floating in it. The fish were unmoving, unblinking, but stacked so well together into complex geometric shapes.


While observing their stacks, one of the many hundred doors on either side creaked open, and all of the water rushed out, draining the shapes and I into a featureless void of black.


Everything was still.


Nothing was still.


The abyss.


I worried that I had ceased to exist, I realized that my finger had been in my ear, and now that it was removed, I could hear a little. I could hear blood dripping all around me. I touched my back and felt the blood, then removed my right finger from my right ear. Now I could hear well. Blood was splattering and sloshing all around me. I breathed heavily and rapidly, frightened that I could not see what I was hearing.


With both hands free, which had cloaked me in darkness. After a brief pause-


-I opened them.


I was not in my house, but rain. And the rain made mud. Lots of mud. I floundered and struggled there in the pit, trying desperately to escape it, but the slick mud acted as my prison. I looked up and witnessed the awesome storm clouds which darkened the world and pitilessly drenched me. I cried out and reached up for branches, which cut my hands and arms. This time, I bled.


If I couldn’t get out, I would escape by digging in. I used my hands, which now looked more like black claws, to strip mud and earth away from the ground. My jet and oily hair clung to my face and blinded me. I didn’t care. I was going to live.


I tunneled for hours. I burrowed like a sightless mole through the earth.


Finally


I looked at him
“These little ones are baby universes


He said nothing, ran my fingers through my hair, and fell asleep amidst the strangling hug of the cool, wet roots.

“Are you our new neighbor?” She asked

“I would suppose so

“What’s your name?” She asked

“Um

“Ummm…” She sounded generally confused.

“Can’t remember your own name? That’s interesting.” I said this trying to convey a feeling of humor and good heartedness.

“Yes

“That’s a pretty name. Nice to meet you Cynthia.”

“Nice to meet you too.” 

“What are you playing with?”

“These are my dolls.”

“Those are some nice dolls there. Do they have names?:

“Um,” she paused for a moment, “and her name is Carol, and his name is… um … Jack. I hadn’t named this one yet, but I think I am gonna call it Robin. Like you.”

I laughed. “Wow

“Hmm

“Of course

“I don’t. I hate mine.”

“Don’t say that. Of course you don’t.”

“I do! I really do!” She stood up. “I hate her!” 

“Why would you say such a thing?”

“She’s such a… such a… She’s a bitch!”

I was shocked at the language. “Where did you learn to speak like that?” 

“My mother!”

I felt like there was a serious problem here. I naturally switched to psychologist mode. “Now why would you say that about her?”

“Ever since my dad died

Her dad died. This was definitely in my job description. Me to the rescue. “Now don’t say that. Your mother loves you just as much as your dad

“You don’t know my mom.” She said

Neither said goodbye to one another.

Fast forward to my first day at my new job as a psychologist. I hadn’t seen much of Cynthia since our meeting, I knew I could be seeing her in my office (I got an office!). Let me be the first to say that this school was no Harvard. The walls were a peeling turquoise green, and the coffee stained tile floors were missing about a tile a row. There was various debris all over the ground, and the walls had distinct stains of mustard, horse radish, marker, and blood. I feel bad for the principal. I met him first thing, who I learned wore the same flannel shirt and pants combo every day. He was not a man to wear a tie. I feel bad though because he obviously cares about the school and the students. “We are the forgotten school, but the government either really did forget us or they just didn’t care. I would honestly have to lean towards the latter. I do really admire Mr. Miley (the principal) though. Although he works at a school turned to shit by vandals and unruly students, I met the different teachers
It really took no time at all after I settled in my office for a student to come in for examination. It was a neat little place. The walls were painted with blue, and on the other side was a comforter, which is where the kids sit during our interviews. Anyways, this first person to come in was a little 8 year old girl in the first grade, just like Cynthia. I already felt bad for the girl when she walked in. She was not a film star beauty, and it looked as if there was not hope for her unless she went under the needle. She had curly red hair, with a face so freckled it looked like her natural face color. She was a chubby little thing, but I couldn’t put my finger on why. She was in here for verbally and physically attacking another girl

“Hello

The girl was looking away

“How are you today?” I asked.

Silence.

“Do you wanna talk?” 

Gretchen shook her head no.

“Why not?”

“Well I…” she began

I laughed. “I almost had you there for a second

The girl flashed a little grin

“Well

The girl continued her smile. 

“Well

That caught her attention.

“Unless

“I’ll talk! Gimme!” She suddenly yelled.

“No

She looked disappointed. “What kind of questions?”

“I just need to ask you a few questions about yourself

She pondered this for a moment

“So why are you here today?”

“I got into a fight.” She answered almost immediately.

“I don‘t normally deal with people just because they‘ve gotten into a fight. Are you sure that’s the only reason?”

She looked confused. “What do you mean that’s not what you deal with?”

I stumbled around looking for an answer that won’t offend her. “I normally deal with… other things. Nevermind that.” Smooth

“I already saw Mrs. Irwin…” Uh oh. Mrs. Irwin was the school counselor. That most likely means she igot stuck in here for something else.

“What did she say?” I asked.

“That I needed to see you!”

“Ok. Ok. Let’s talk about your fight. Can you tell me about it?”

She waited before she answered. “She called me ugly

“And what did you do about that?”

“I told her to leave me alone.”

I believed that was an appropriate answer. “That was an appropriate answer. Then what happened?”

“I attacked her with scissors

“And why did you do that?”

“She called me ugly

Although I was actually kind of offended

“I got her. Right in the back. She’s in the hospital now.”

“Who did you get into a fight with?”

“Cynthia Tyler.”

Cynthia! The little girl I met! The poor devil was in the hospital because of a scissor wound to the back! That was the climax of the conversation. A few weeks later

A boring two weeks went by. It wasn’t till the end of those two weeks where my first incident happened, trying to make sure I wasn’t the only one here. There was no response. I proceeded cautiously up the stairs, and with each step I began to hear more and more. At first, all I could hear was the faint whisper of… something. Somebody, some creature, I couldn’t tell. As I continued, I began to hear that it was a little girl’s voice… singing. I couldn’t hear the words at first,” which was always creepy if you did it just right. I slowly began walking up more stairs. I started to begin to make out the words. 

*Gretchen…. School again…. Don’t like her…*

The rest was inaudible. I very slowly walked up a few more steps

*Gretchen
If she‘s gone

I wanted to walk out

*Gretchen
If she’s gone

My heart was pounding and my face was turning red as I went farther up.

*Gretchen
If she’s gone

This was it. I was nearly there just … a few more… steps….

*Gretchen
If she’s gone

1360469519.0,188bsu,Peaches,Jdigital1983,19,6,13,"One of my favorite memories of my father is helping him steal peaches. 

The peach industry in Chilton County harvests thousands upon thousands of peaches each year. I suppose he figured they wouldn’t miss a basket or two.

Eventually, my uncle and cousin started to join us. My cousin and I would wait sleepily on a blanket in the back of the truck’s camper while my father and uncle picked out a few buckets. 

One such morning in late June

Soon enough

I must have drifted off to sleep after that. I just remember waking up in the middle of my father shouting from some distance away. After waking up fully, rattling sort of noise. It was so low I couldn’t tell if I was hearing it or just imagining it. My young mind thought it sounded like someone was at the bottom of a glass of chocolate milk and was sucking the hell out of it with a straw. Both my father’s shouting and the noise grew closer. My cousin was somehow still asleep.

I rubbed my eyes and peeked out the side window of the camper. I saw my father running towards the truck with a bucket of peaches, cranking up the engine. He was still shouting, his fear had made his voice ragged. As he turned the truck around in the dirt road, I saw what he had been running from.

The early morning light illuminated the Thing’s gigantic head as it glided gently above the peach trees. I could not tell if it was that tall or if it was flying but it’s head didn’t dip and rise with the motion of walking. Its face was gnarled and badly wrinkled. The skin was the warm gray of a river bed and its mouth was screwed up into a rictus grin with tiny nubs of teeth darting through. It caught the sight of the truck with its small, more intensely.

By that time, knocking me over onto my cousin.

I don’t remember much else until my father stopped the truck. We were on the shoulder of the asphalt road, he wouldn't understand what happened and I had no way to explain it.

I heard the cab door open and I saw my father walk past with the bucket of peaches. He threw them in the woods with a yell and walked quickly back to the truck. There was a short pause before he climbed back in the cab and slammed the door. The truck's engine roared to life and we drove home quietly into the pinkish violet hue of the rising sun.

The truck sputtered out the last of it's temporary life in the plain concrete driveway of our home. My cousin and I, hoping at some moment this would all be awful prank. My uncle popping out of the bushes and yelling, “Gotcha!” while gut-laughing at our youthful gullibility. 

In my heart I knew differently. The quality unique to children that allows them to be bright-eyed and hopeful in this fucked up world had been snuffed out when that damned Thing got a hold of my uncle.

My father shakily opened the rear of the camper and looked at us. The morning light shone around him making a ragged silhouette from the man. 

He looked towards me and muttered

I gulped down the stone and my throat and nodded. He hung his head. 

“Where is my daddy?”

My cousin was out of the blanket now

My uncle was reported as a missing person. There were search teams, everyone besides my father, my cousin and my aunt went on with their lives. My aunt still got a few do-gooders from church to search the fields of the county every now and then but as my father and I knew, it was all in vain. My uncle or his body would never be found. The Thing had digested him along with the peaches or had done something much worse.  I find it better not to think about it.

I watched the toll it took on my father through the years. He didn't turn to drink or drugs

My cousin did the best he could for a boy that went through losing his father and is finishing up a business degree in Tuscaloosa. He came out of it the best of us. He hadn't seen the Thing that morning.

As for me,  I don't make it back. I can't live in the same world as that thing. I have to kill it or die trying. For my father. For the man shaped hole it left in my cousin's life. For myself.

I have no idea how to kill it but I know where it lives. People disappear around this town all the time. 

I may not finish it off but I'll make damn sure it remembers me. 

Watch the papers.

""You folks need some help?"" I asked

The man greeted me with a wave and a grin. ""Hey fella, deer came out the mist,  blew out a tire while dodging it, we don't have the spare anymore neither.""

""If you need a lift somewhere

He looked back to his, but it was cold and I'd imagine she wasn't in the best of moods, so I just gave her a sincere smile and a half wave. She stared at her husband for a moment and nodded.

""Well that would be just great
""We're just a couple minutes off of 302b

""Not a problem, I immediately felt awkward about the fact that they may be second guessing their choice to get in a car with me, ""uh, sorry about that"" I said as we pulled back onto the highway towards the opposing exit. 

It did only take a few minutes to hook around and get to 302b, he said he had a son, and that he just wanted to see him grow up and have a life for himself. He seemed a little sad at the thought, but I had no intentions to pry into the life of a complete stranger. All the while, his wife remained in the back, she said a few soft spoken words, but remained mostly silent. I had noticed that she was carrying a decorated box with her, with a look of yearning present in her eyes. Again
We pulled onto bartonsvill wood road

""This is fine man, opened the back door for his wife, and turned back to me, leaning his head through the door. 

""I really don't mind driving you down

He just chuckled and shook his head, and turned away with his wife, disappearing slowly into the blackness of the drive. What remained in my hand was a 20 dollar bill, which was awesome, a great gesture that would go towards gas money. I stashed the bill in the console compartment where I keep my change.
I got back on to route 80-e, and didn't even begin, I had left at my friends apartment, frantically, I pulled an illegal u turn through the medium and called my friend, hammering my shit-box Toyota to its max. It took me under an hour to get back to happy valley, going about 105 the whole time. I told my friend about my good deed and grabbed my book bag. He called me an idiot for picking up a ""bunch of hitch hiking loonies"", I was finally back on the road headed east. As I passed tannersvill, helping them out.
As I began to approach exit 302, cold grabbed me and pushed all the air out of my lungs, my heart skipped and hammered in my chest and all the hair on my body rose with a tingled jolt of pure horror. Two figures, standing there at the car, looking down the road, needing help. Jeff and his wife, standing in the exact same spot, the wife still holding the decorated box. I just looked, and no grasp of what I was seeing before me. I instinctively pushed my foot into the floor
Thankfully it did, to not ask myself any questions of what I just experienced. 
I couldn't let it go, thought I was just messing and trying to get a good scare. I honestly begged him to ask around about it. 
The next morning, he sounded a little shaken. He explained that the only thing he has found was an article published in a local paper two weeks ago about a young couple and their 4 year old boy who were in a car accident right before exit 302. However; there was controversy over the accident due to the mothers mental stability and the fact that she had been driving the vehicle. All three died, there names were Jeff and Amy Hendrickson, with their son Thomas.
To this day I can't get everything straight in my head. All I know is that I never found the 20 dollar bill in my console compartment that morning,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,,t3_171e2j

After about five months at the school, ignored the nerdy guy. But even so, I found a friend amongst them. His name was Scott, and he’d never really been acknowledged as the greatest student. He was ¼ slacker and the other 3/4ths stand-offish. Though he wasn’t the brightest or the most social, we had enough in common to start a relationship I guess. 

One day, I swung my messenger bag over my shoulder and headed down to the lobby of the dorm building to meet Scott. We had a ways to walk, considering the lecture was being held in the far end of the campus. But we didn’t mind. It was fall, so it’s not as if it was bad weather or anything.
When we got to room 302, so we were in good shape. However, there were no other people in the room. It wasn’t like we were an hour early. I thought about the possibility that maybe we were in the wrong room, but I checked and we weren’t. We sat down in the front row of about five rows of chairs. Scott nudged my arm.
“Great turn-out
I chuckled in that awkward way strangers do when talking with other strangers. While I was sitting there, let alone how to communicate like two normal individuals. I was snapped out of my thoughts by the sound of the opening of a door. I turned my head to see a tall man snake across the room and take his place behind the podium. He looked out at what were supposed to be filled seats.
“Nice that all of you could make it, I’m glad you two were kind enough to show up. Of course, not many people are interested in this kind of thing.” I wondered for a moment what he meant by his last sentence, but I just smiled, humoring his obvious attempt at warming up to us. “My name is Professor Neye. I teach sociology and major in psychology. I graduated from this college in ‘84 at the top of my class. Today, I’d like to share with you the many wonders of the human brain…and mind.” There was a long pause, as if he was focusing on that word; mind. “If you have any questions, I shall begin.” He turned around and started to draw on the white board. Before long, your name please
“J-Jamie Loremann.” I replied hesitantly for some reason. He looked at me
“Well Mr. Loremann, can you identify these parts of the brain please?”
“Yes sir, the temporal lobe, parietal, and the occipital.”
“Very good, now, in psychology, you not only have to know which segments of the brain are which, but what functions they perform.” He pointed with the marker to the frontal lobe. “The frontal lobe, as I assume you both are familiar with, stores most dopamine neurons. Dopamine, is a great factor in your motivational learning. So let’s say you lose that dopamine
“The function of the parietal lobe is mainly sensory of the body and how you perceive and understand numbers. If this part of the brain gets thrown out, there are very serious repercussions. For example, your vision could be seriously affected, or even lost. And you hallucinate.” He stopped, rubbing his forehead with his thumb and index finger. He closed his eyes, as if concentrating. “The things you see, like people who are gone

Was he having a moment, he spoke again.
“The mind is such a complicated thing, full of riddles and things you don’t want to be real. The demons and monsters from your nightmares, all coming alive right in front of you. And what makes it worse is that no one else can see them. No, no what’s even worse than that is that what I see, the creatures I see are real and they follow you. They follow, they follow, they follow-” He cut off in mid-sentence
“Professor? Are you-” Before I could finish, wondering what in the hell had just happened to the man, when we saw it. A gun shot at the back of his head. The bullet would’ve gone right through his occipital lobe. We ran to get a professor, another student, anyone to help us. Thankfully, the librarian was organizing books and came to our aid. I will never forget those paramedics in their almost-too-white uniforms carrying a dead Professor Neye out of room 302, and through the doors to the awaiting ambulance. 

I couldn’t talk for the next month, both of us aware that if we so much as exchanged words, we’d remember that awful day in fall. I got through freshman year at the top of my class. All of my professors told me that my knowledge of the human mind could really help with possible career opportunities, especially if I took a psychology course. But I would never take psychology. Only Scott knew why. And losing our friendship was better for the both of us. 

I still think back to what Professor Neye said about the things that follow us. Maybe those things are experiences like the one Scott and I had. Or maybe they’re something totally different, they follow, they follow-

If the circumstances were unusual, stating it would be impossible for another human being to create injuries of their type without an external wound. Another camper, a young woman, had her tongue missing. While investigators initially suspected foul play, no footprints were found near any of the bodies other than the students' own. Adding to the mystery, the bodies were all shown to have high levels of radioactive contamination.

Nine years after the incident in the Ural mountains another group of hikers were found dead, the bodies were all found within a dozen yards of each other in a nearby clearing. The scene was described as horrifying by police. The bodies were positioned as if thrown at great speed, postured as if their bones had been smashed to splinters. The results of the medical investigation was immediately sealed by the Soviet government.

Again, the medical examiner discovered that the initial description of the hikers' bones being smashed was incorrect. Their entire skeletons were entirely missing, despite having no external wounding whatsoever. High levels of calcium and other nutrients were found in their blood and surrounding tissues, as if something had somehow rapidly liquified the bone. Crime scene photos also revealed that the clearing the bodies were found in was not natural. Topographic maps taken only months before had shown the area to be a lush forest. Entire trees had been smashed to splinters in a path more than twenty meters wide and over a two hundred meter area.

Despite the Soviet crackdown on all information, only one entity could have been responsible. Something that was not meant for our earth, something that struck fear into the heart of a certain insane Arab.

They believed that the five senses clouded our awareness of eternity, the scientists performed a complex operation in which every sensory nerve connection to the brain was surgically severed.* Although the test subject retained full muscular function, he could not see, hear, taste, smell, or feel. With no possible way to communicate with or even sense the outside world

Scientists monitored him as he spoke aloud about his state of mind in jumbled, unintelligible voices in his head. Assuming it was an onset of psychosis, the scientists paid little attention to the man’s concerns.

Two days later, he could communicate back. The scientists were intrigued, but were not convinced until the subject started naming dead relatives of the scientists. He repeated personal information to the scientists that only their dead spouses and parents would have known. At this point, a sizable portion of scientists left the study.

After a week of conversing with the deceased through his thoughts, his consciousness was bombarded by hundreds of voices that refused to leave him alone. He frequently threw himself against the wall, trying to elicit a pain response. He begged the scientists for sedatives, so he could escape the voices by sleeping. This tactic worked for three days, until he started having severe night terrors. The subject repeatedly said that he could see and hear the deceased in his dreams.

Only a day later, speaking of hell and the end of the world. At one point, he yelled “No heaven, no forgiveness” for five hours straight. He continually begged to be killed, but the scientists were convinced that he was close to establishing contact with God.

After another day, the subject halted his struggling and screaming. He stared blankly at the ceiling as teardrops silently streaked across his face. For two weeks, the subject had to be manually rehydrated due to the constant crying. Eventually, he turned his head and, despite his blindness, made focused eye contact with a scientist for the first time in the study.

He whispered “I have spoken with God

He woke up in a cold sweat, similar to the one you smell right after lightning strikes on a dark and storm-riddled night. He escaped the confines of his sheets, hoping to disperse this unusual feeling that he’d felt ever since moving into the house a week before. He had been so excited to move in before, what with the steal he bought the house at; now he was starting to question why he had gotten it so cheap.

He walked across the creaking paneling of the floorboards, which was in need of quite a few repairs. He noted to himself to get on that…someday.

He gazed over to his nightstand and stared at the dull red glow of his alarm clock: 3:15 in the morning, what with these random awakenings. The moon cast a light through the window through his window and he turned to gaze at it one last time before returning to his slumber.

The barn roof. No, eyes clenched tightly, staring into the black abyss of his eyelids. He stood there; convincing himself he had exhausted himself to the point of imagining things, and relaxed, opening his eyes.

It was still there. Why, gazing directly at his window, with a wide grin on it’s face, head tilted just slightly to the side. Its eyes were wide, oh so wide, and the moonlight reflected off of them in the most uncomfortable of ways. It just stood there, it’s posture pristinely still, and stared. It just stared.

He took a step back, he stood there, not sure what to do. He took another step, every so slowly and quietly, stepping onto a loose floorboard, resulting in a creak. He looked out the window to see it had taken another stride, almost at the edge of the roof now. It was cackling in a maniacal way, its stark white skin and hollowed eyes, crooked smile as he continued to stare directly into the window of his house.

His phone was too far to reach, and readied himself to sprint out of the room. He expected the figure to take another step, when instead it raised its arm, extending a bony, wretched finger, pointing past him, at his bedroom door. He twisted his head, the doorway completely empty.

He stood there and immediately regretted his decision. He had done the one thing he had he shouldn’t have, which was now pried wide open. The figure no longer was on the barn roof.

He heard a cackling from the closet…

**10 FOUND DEAD AT DESTROYED LABORATORY **

""Local authorities found the bodies of 7 men and 3 women at a destroyed laboratory earlier today. All victims had been horribly burned


It was the day of my grandfathers funeral. It was raining heavily that day, or people my grandfather new had filled the air. No one cried. I had wondered why no one was crying at the funeral today on our way home. Maybe it was because my grandfather had touched them all in such a way that they respected him so much, and wanted to leave him with dignity. Plus, my grandfather was always the guy who could make you smile. They must have remembered the good times they spent with him. I know I did.

My parents took me with them to my grandfathers' lawyers office a few days later. You know, his money and who gets it right? Well, then we got to me. I was very surprised when I heard my name. I didn't really expect anything, since my grandfather always taught me to be independent and not take handouts. We all listened intently as the lawyer read:

""And to my grandson

This just made everything even stranger. His journal? Why would he give me something like that? Maybe he had a lesson to teach me threw his words and thought I could use it. I reluctantly took the journal and examined it as some kind of alien object. After the reading was done

I was really eager to begin reading the book as soon as I got home. Who knew what kind of mysteries my grandfather had tucked away from us? I read the journal, or some new element that they would try to use. Most of those were failed and they had to keep trying. The next part of this story are the pages of my grandfathers journal, starting at May 3rd and ending May 12th, 1943.
___________________________________________________________

May 3rd

Things in the lab have been going quite well. We are making progress on a new type of nuclear warhead.  We've discovered how to keep the element stable while inside the bomb before it explodes. We just need to put further research into it before we actually send it off to main nuclear research facility. I've gotten to meet the team over these past few days. They all seem like determined scientists to me. There is one fellow i'm not too sure about though. Don't get me wrong, he is the one scientist who comes up with the ideas for the weaponry. I have yet to see any of his latest ideas.

May 5th

That man is beginning to give me the creeps. All he does is sit in his room, but for now, I need my rest. Designing weapons of mass destruction isn't a cakewalk.

May 6th

There is definitely something going on back there that he doesn't want anyone to see. Today, like I expected, declined. So I pushed him a little, and continuously asked him why and if I could enter. I got repeated ""No""s, so I gave up. At this point I am extremely suspicious of what goes on behind that locked door, so I ask one of the other scientists about it, one of his close friends. All I got were worried looks and rushed conversations

May 8th

Today I asked one of the scientists for a detailed tour of the entire facility, and I couldn't be happier to be here. When we walked by the man's room, I asked my tour guide who's room this was. Sure, I played dumb, but it worked. Only slightly though. I discovered that the man's name is Severin Elmersson, and that he works on special projects in there. Ones that only he is allowed to work on. I also discovered that they are currently working on his newest top secret one in the guarded part of the facility. I always thought that was strange when I came here that they would have one part of the facility guarded when only we are out here.

May 10th

I was finally able to get a chance to talk to Severin today. He seems like a very nice man, and I found that he was the man who personally oversaw the development of russia's first nuclear bomb, but was discharged for reasons he didn't say. I wanted to know more about what he oversaw, but he could only tell me one thing: ""Something that is so powerful, that it could change the face of the world forever."" I didn't question him on this matter anymore, knowing that I wouldn't get anymore information. I also discovered that he was from Sweden, hence his odd name. After we were done talking, which is the guarded part of the facility. He said he would call off the guards between 11:00 A.M. and 2:00 P.M., not even saying goodbye
___________________________________________________________

I searched all of over my grandfathers journal to find the entry on May 11th. It wasn't there. I couldn't really do anything about it
___________________________________________________________

May 12th

It was horrible. That horribly disfigured...THING. I don't know what I saw, please be warned: do not tell anyone of these events. They will hunt you down.

At about 12:24 P.M., there were no guards at the entrance, and I was able to walk right in. As I walked in, I heard footsteps around the corner. Severin came to greet me as I entered, and he had a very excited and happy look on his face. He greeted me warmly, like an old friend, and led me through the hallway.
""So Severin
""Oh you'll see it soon enough. Trust me
We turned the corner, and he nodded and ripped the sheet off. What I saw next was horrific. I had no idea what it was, but it was a horribly disfigured creature that made these odd noises as the other scientist ripped the sheet off. I stared, and slowly walked up to the glass, fixated on the creature. I couldn't muster a word at what I was looking at, but I eventually did. ""What is this thing!?!"" Severin walked up to me and placed his hand on my shoulder. ""Something that will change the face of the world, my friend."" He then moved away to a terminal, banging it's head on the walls and floor, don't be so frantic."" I had begun to ran down the hallway as he said that. I decided that I needed to leave that night. Leave the facility.
___________________________________________________________

After I read that entry
___________________________________________________________

May 29th 1990

I can't believe I found this old journal. Today was the day that Boris Yeltsin was elected as president, the start of the Russian Nuclear Program. All fond memories, and I couldn't put it down. But then I got to the may entries of 1943. I must have been exposed to some radiation during this, because I don't remember any of that beyond May 10th. Maybe I had been taking a lot of pain killers at that time. I don't know, but it was extremely strange reading what I read.
___________________________________________________________

A few days ago

What really disturbed me was the research I had gathered while I was writing the paper. I looked up on Wikipedia about a man named Severin Elmersson.

Here is the post for those of you who haven't already heard about this:

""Everybody knows that if you surf the web long enough

The first strange thing about the site was that I didn’t find it by actually looking for it. It was e-mailed to me by someone I didn’t know. The e-mail was as follows:

“Hi there
found this site is very nice thought u might like
normalpornfornormalpeople.com
pass it on

Pretty standard issue chain letter

It was a very average, boring, and incoherent rant that I don’t remember or have saved.

The site had a strange tagline (which even today people haven’t figured out the meaning of)
“Normal Porn for Normal People

And from the sound of that, very curious to see what “Normal People” get their rocks off to. So I scrolled down through the rant and…nothing. The page didn’t seem to link to anywhere else, and I was about to leave when I noticed every word of the rant was its own hyperlink.

So I clicked one of them
“normalpornfornormalpeople.com/ (random letters)”

So I stopped for a minute and asked myself if I really wanted to waste God knows how much time clicking random links that will likely give me a virus that will rape my computer. I figured I’d just try it for maybe 5 minutes
I was just about to say “Fuck this” when I clicked on the 3rd link, and the man would set it down for the dog to eat. This was all that happened, for 30 minutes. It was obvious that the cameraman had to stop filming and wait until the dog was ready to eat again, and the dog seemed rather sick by the end of it.

I know what you’re thinking: “What the hell does that have to do with porn?” I have no clue. I’ve seen a little over two dozen videos from this site

After watching peanut.avi, some guy who had received the same chain letter I did. The image board thread got lots of people with nothing better to do to dig through the site, and that’s how I saw other videos.

Most of those two dozen videos were very uneventful, sterile feel to it.

The conversations were just idle banter about previous jobs or embarrassing childhood moments. I kept expecting some kind of discussion about what the people were filming or what the site was about, the people who appeared in these videos were quite attractive.

However

I’ll give brief descriptions of the stranger videos

lickedclean.avi

A 10 minute video filmed by a hidden camera in which we see a repairman working on a washing machine for the first 2 minutes. When it’s fixed, and he begins to lick all over the top of the washing machine. This goes on for 7 minutes.

jimbo.avi

A 5 minute video of an obese mime performing his act. It was actually pretty funny, the camera cuts to static briefly and cuts back to the man sobbing quietly, still wearing mime outfit and makeup. Some kind of obscure fetish?

dianna.avi

4 minute video in which the camerman talks to a woman in a room different from the “interview room.” This room looks like one you’d find in a normal person’s house. Exactly where they are is never specified

I didn’t notice this until someone on the image board thread pointed it out

jessica.avi

Another 4 minute cameraman video. This time he’s outside a house

The strange thing is: No one so far has been able to identify where this street is. Guesses have ranged everywhere from Europe to Australia to the Philippines

tonguetied.avi

10 minute video. The first 5 minutes consist of an elderly woman making out with a mannequin. The video cuts out like it did in jimbo.avi halfway through, there is no sound.

stumps.avi

5 minute long video where a man with no legs is attempting to breakdance on a DDR mat in what looks like the kitchen from peanut.avi
He breathes heavily and pleads with someone off-screen to let him rest. This off-screen person becomes terrifyingly enraged and yells at him to keep dancing

privacy.avi

The woman from dianna.avi is masturbating on a mattress in the “interview room
The door in this room was always closed in other videos, you can see an animal quickly run through the hallway.

And finally the last video we uncovered: useless.avi

In this 18 minute video, but he does not enter.
He holds the door open for the animal that was running in the hall in the previous video. It’s revealed to be an adult chimpanzee
When the chimp enters the room, and begins to maul her.
The assault goes on for a grueling 7 minutes

The thread exploded with activity after this video was uncovered, sent him 5 messages and never got a response.

I waited a moment for the cloudiness of my brain to disappear before I got out of bed. I couldn’t tell you why I decided to get up and walk out of my bedroom; I guess I just felt the beckoning of its sinister energy calling to me from behind the walls.

 As I opened my bedroom door

A light had begun to emanate around this strange new entrance. The door glowed with a nuclear green so enticing that I could do nothing to stop myself from opening the portal and climbing inside. I looked around the perplexing room, I had almost no emotion at all towards this grotesque display of the human form. The lamps surrounded the bed, which sat directly in front of me, soiled and rotten. The whole room smelled like putrid flesh and the bright green glow had subsided to a forest green aura. 

I heard a noise to my right; it came out of a corner so dark I had to squint in an attempt to perceive the figure that resided in the blackness. He moved into the light. He did not speak

He sat down next to me and stroked my hand,” and I didn’t. I noticed on the desk next to the bed lie a gruesome pair of rusty scissors and what can only be described as a tiny heart-shaped pillow made from human flesh. The pillow was no more than two square inches and it was clearly going through the natural process of decay. He did nothing more than look at me, but once again, I knew what he wanted; he wanted to sew that tiny pillow into me. 

I did not struggle, I just watched as he sliced through my right thigh with the rusty scissors until the bone glistened from beneath the muscle. He smiled. He carefully picked up the heart-shaped flesh pillow and tucked it away tightly into my leg. His long dirty fingernails crept along my skin as he watched the pillow settle down into my being. His joy was overwhelming as he reached for a needle and thread to sew me up. I couldn’t help but feel a deep love for this creature suddenly; a kind of love that transcends all human emotion, a love for which there is no word. He sewed me up with care and precision then I promptly got up and left the mysterious room. I limped back into my bedroom and fell back asleep without any difficulty. 

The next morning when I woke up, I felt a horrific surge of pain through my leg. Thinking that it was all in my head, I threw back the covers to prove to myself that the pain was all psychological. The smell hit me before I could actually process what I was seeing; layer upon layer of infection and decay raced through my nasal cavity. I was going to be sick. Was I going to be sick? My head hurt and I was dizzy as I stood up to limp to the bathroom. I drew myself a bath desperately trying to clean the filth off me. It didn’t work. 

Days went by before I mentioned my bizarre injury to anyone; who would believe me anyway? When the pain finally became too much to bear, I saw my father slither his way into the room. He stood behind my mother; he put his index finger up to his mouth and mimed “Shhh.” Then from behind his back he pulled out the pair of rusty scissors that were used to slice open my thigh, my blood still stained on the blades. My heart sank. My mother was still staring at me, her mouth gaping and her eyes flooding with tears; she clearly couldn’t compose herself enough to speak again yet. I looked into my father’s eyes for some kind of explanation, but now in place of his eyes were two black holes darker than the deepest black man has ever known. As I peered into them I began to feel like I was falling. I *was* falling. I hit the ground with a painful and echoing thud. The last thing I remember is my father standing over me, rusty scissors in hand, burrowing deep into my soul with those lifeless eyes.

He spent hours working on the masks that hung around the walls of his shop. That he loved his work was undeniable, body snatchers stole her body away. After that, the mask maker was never the same. 

He would often be seen up late in his work shop, as if he was too tired of this world, and didn't want to live in it for much longer. Or at least, that was his face when he wasn't at his work bench. When he was there, working, his beady little eyes were focused on the mask, and the mask seemed to come to life beneath his fingers, and as it spread across weaving strange shapes

One night, this came as a surprise to most of the townsfolk, as none could recall the last time he had closed his shop for so long a time. When he finally reopened the shop, his face drooped lower than ever, and not even working at the bench filling the backlog of requests that he had gotten seemed to cheer him up. If anything, it seemed to sadden him even more. He started barring entrance to those who got too curious about his workshop and those three weeks that he had shut himself in. 

In the months that followed, and among the words heard were ""Demons,"" and, ""I should of never tried it."" My grandfather himself witnessed first hand the owner's mutterings when he went to pick up a mask for his sister. The old man was not aware of my grandfather, and spoke aloud the name Ba'alzamon. My grandfather did not recognize the name, so he assumed that Ba'alzamon was simply a foreigner. My grandfather told me that the mask maker was bent over on something he could not see, though it was clearly not a mask, the old mask maker would of continued working on his project.

As it were, all of which made a rather loud ruckus. The old man's visage when he turned around was frightful, it left my grandfather, a wee child at the time, in hysterics for weeks, so much so that he refuses to this day to even go near Os Immortalis. The face my grandfather described was only one of madness, of a man who has lost something precious and he only knew it after he lost it, and would do anything to get it back.

THE SMITH MURDERS. PART I

 

 

Lisa Smith sat upon her living room couch next to her sister, a large german shepard, was sleeping on the front porch. Kaylin was dozing next to Lisa, her long blond hair covering most of her face. Lisa was 20 as of a

week ago, the light from the television flickering off of her face. Deep in thought as to how someone as innocent as her sister had managed to survive in such a vile, hate-filled world, Lisa brushed the hair away from in front of her sister's face; admiring the quiet beauty and innocence that seemed to radiate from her younger kin.

 

""Come on, ""Come on"" she said mockingly, as if she was motivating a kitten to climb its first stair. She tapped her sister's shoulder again, a grimace dawning on Kaylin's face as she was roused from her slumber.

""Le'me alone""

""Ill sleep on the couch"".

 

Lisa got up
tomorrow from sleeping the wrong way"".

 
""I don't care

 

""Fine, having been raised
in Florida her whole life.

 
She rounded the corner out of the living room and started upstairs

 
20 minutes later, she looked at the housephone next to it.

 
It rang

 
""PRIVATE NUMBER""

 
She shrugged

 
""Hello?"" she said.

 
All she heard was someone breathing.

 
""Hello?""

""Lisa"" the voice said

 
""Yes that's me

 

"" I remember the first time I saw you. You were... so beautiful.."" The voice was calm,

""It's been a long time Lisa

 
Fear ignited in Lisa

 
""We've met once

 
""I'M CALLING THE POLICE!""

Hugo started barking outside

 

""Your dog's name is Hugo, then silence. The rain still pattering the windows of her room. ""Hey listen, I'm gonna
have to let you go real quick. I'll see you soon.""

 
The voice hung up.

 
Lisa was terrified, how he got her number, and how he knew about her dog and pajamas.

 
She snapped back to reality

 
No Dial-tone.

 
""Oh shit

 
The power went out.

 
She flew out her room and into her father's room, taking the safety off of the pistol. It was raining harder now, the wind shifting towards her, the raindrops hurtling at her like bullets. Ignoring the sting of the pelting rain, and forgetting to shut the door, she ran around the side of the house to the circuit breaker, only to find an axe lodged deep within the fuses.

 
""Oh my god

 
It yelped.

 
The lifeless body of Hugo slumped onto the ground, unforgiving, seeming to ask 'why?'. She fell to her knees as she picked up her childhood friend and companion. The tears began to flow now, the wave of guilt of having taken the life of another being she loved crashing over her.

What was that? The only coherent thought I could manage…

My dog was the only thing in the room with me. She sat curled up on top of a pillow over on the futon not even five feet from me. She too looked up, perched upon her pillow. I knew that look… She was expecting me to give an order.

“Come, patting the bed beside me.
I knew this feeling too… It was the feeling I got before I saw something awful… I had been having problems with hallucinations for a few months, no lights, nothing… The way it was designed, it made the viewer focus very intently on the window, ignoring the rest of the frame. I did just this… Then a lightning bolt illuminates the frame of a macabre, bloddied, albeit happy Pinkie Pie. Of course, I had given a slight startle, and I made a concerted effort not to turn on any lights. Upon crossing the threshold back into my bedroom, I couldn’t move. She spoke to me then as single phrase.

“GO TO SLEEP”
As one could imagine, I turned the events of that night over in my head once again, then spoke aloud.

“Go away
In all honesty, something seemed out of place… I got up then, throwing my legs over my bedside and stood. Daisy scurried off then back to the futon. The atmosphere in my room was choking… I didn’t like it… Even with the fan running. I pressed the “stop” button on the little control panel near my light switch. The switch itself didn’t actually do anything due to the house’s faulty wiring. It was a real hassle… Daisy gave a yelp suddenly. I spun around to see what was wrong, only to reel at what was presented to me. She was dead… Skewered through the neck with what appeared to be a kitchen knife… But the knife hadn’t come from my kitchen… It had a chrome handle. My knives had the black hilts… It took me a few moments to calm down, but I finally mustered the nerve to approach. Why I hadn’t gone and got my step-mother who had a revolver at her bedside right then and there is beyond me, but I approached… Took hold of the glimmering hilt… Pulled…

“THAT’S MINE.” A deep
Panicked

Someone caught my wrist… A face I knew too well accompanied that hand… That ghostly pale visage… Perfectly round eyes

“Jeff… The Killer…”
He tilted his head for a moment

“You’re not welcome in this world.”

“GO TO SLEEP.” He said
Just as he drew back to strike

He’s just human… He’s no Rake or Slender Man… Just stay calm and you’ll stay alive… Just human… Just human…
He ducked my strike and managed to open up a large slash up my right forearm. I hissed and made another swing, the bat found its target: his kneecap. We were level now… With a harsh jerk, he extracted the blade, his eerie grin maintaining. I gave a shriek, just as I imagine he wanted me to… Another swing of my bat met his ribs, causing him to bend over even more, his cheek almost to the floor. I knew if I was going to finish it, making to smash the heavy end of my weapon into his upturned temple.

My ears were ringing… I couldn’t move… My jaw had dropped… I felt warm fluid spewing from my stomach… I had just been skewered… Jeff’s face was inches from my own… He was waiting… Waiting for that spark to leave my eyes…

NOW!
“Go to sleep…” I muttered.

It was then that I made my decisive move… With the strength I had left, I must say…My door flew open just as I let the black of unconsciousness take me…

It was over…

I had just killed the Killer…

It's a miracle and a glory and the greatest thing to ever happen

Those couple grams are more than enough for it to happen. Sure, in two years you'll have it back with nearly full functionality. It's the sort of miracle that's believable enough to catch on. It won't solve all our problems, and it'll even create a few more. Like overpopulation like we'd never saw coming. But it works and it's cheap and it's plentiful and that's all we need. Sure they can't quite explain how the thing actually manages to rewrite our genetic code after we swallow a few grams; but they promise the answers will come someday and that there are no ill side effects.

It's from a 'previously unknown variety of starfish; but they won't even tell you that on the news. I think the story right now is that it's something they're growing artificially. These starfish live in the deepest, god knows how, and thought it was a different kind of starfish and ate part of it and a year later he had that foot he lost back. I'm sure they tore apart his house and tested gallons of his blood and interrogated everyone he ever spoke to, but somehow they figured out just when the regeneration happened and eventually found the fucking thing. It had been alive when he ate one of its arms and I guess he took a pity on it and let the thing live in a tank in his house. Well, this led to that and eventually they brought up a ton of the suckers.

But here's the thing. Think about or technology and innovations; think about what they're for. Mostly it's to keep us alive longer, as a race, we'd already had the ability to communicate via thought? What if we were naturally incredibly hardy and long-lived? What if we started out having everything we needed without having to do a bit of work? Our goals would turn to keeping our world the way it was and simply enjoying things. With a mind so powerful it can transmit and receive thoughts with no effort, it stands to reason other amazing things are possible too. With that mind staying completely intact in even the smallest sliver of the creature, one has to wonder just what else that mind can do..

So now here's the question. If you'd survived all this time just sitting around on the bottom of the ocean with this incredible intellect, then simply displace the minds of those enemies and solve the conflict? I don't think it's crazy at all, and I don't think it's crazy that there's suddenly a lot more war all over the world. A lot research put into birth control and the 'accidental' release of that superbug that makes men sterile. We should be enjoying world peace but instead we're killing each other faster than ever before.

Maybe they're not even threatened

Don't ask me how I know all of this

1319571970.0,lortm,A Russian Winter,Juggernog,16,3,15,"It was an old rumour amongst Russians that during their harshest winters were dangerous in more ways than the cold. A Russian scientist, if any. Some tried to run – there were no foreseeable barriers preventing those send out from attempting to return to civilisation - but others stood still

These experiments went on for three years, convinced that Russians were more resistant to the cold than Germans were. He had his scientists lock him outside his own facility, in the same region as the German prisoners, and in the same timeframe – and roughly the same snowy conditions. Viktor had a heart monitor attached to him before he left, so that the scientists could observe the effects of the cold on his body in that way. He had never expected to be killed by his own experiment.

In the end his body appeared to just give up fighting the cold and his heart rate slowed and stopped. The scientists watching the heart rate monitor were overwhelmed with grief, ready for some oblivious child or curious, lost tourist to find. The thing was, they searched for the body for three days, before finally giving up – declaring the body ‘lost’ and searching for a new lead scientist. The laboratory closed down soon afterwards, the team unable to find a new lead scientist.

Two years on, authorities found him, frozen in position, deep under the snow. The cause of death was unapparent, although curiously not caused by the freezing cold. The man had no reason to want to kill himself; nor any motive to go out into the harsh winter. Top investigators were baffled by the man’s mysterious death. It wasn’t until they looked through his possessions that they noticed something remotely out of the ordinary.

The man had kept an audio diary, and then the first odd recording began. The recording device was missing, but it was obviously portable, seen as the audio logs seemed to be recorded from different places, judging by the amount of ambient noise prevalent in each of the recordings. The former self of the man found frozen in the snow began to speak.

“The time is 6:45pm, to ward off the cold” the man spoke, and then a pause, the device was still recording, but the man had stopped talking. After about ten seconds to man began to speak again “There is a man staring at me through my window” another pause, briefer this time, lasting for only about three seconds. “He looks inhuman, and cold.” His voice shivered “Oh so cold”.

For the next five minutes the tape consisted of the man reasoning with himself on whether or not he should allow the mysterious man into his home, staring at him through the window, into his home. He remarks to himself over the tape “I just hope this doesn’t turn out to be the worst mistake I ever make”.

The tape stops here

“The time is 7:54pm, with his never-warming cold, winter-blue eyes. I feel dead when he looks at me, I’ll tell the truth, I’m more than just a little anxious.” The tape stops and moves on again.

“The time is 8…” the man stammers, as I wasn’t fond of his presence particularly, but I can’t allow him to go into the cold alone, I wouldn’t wish harm upon the man.” There is a brief pause “Oh, and he says his name is Viktor.”

From this point onwards, the whistle of the continuous cold wind, continues until the end of the tape has been reached, where the end of the recording is signified with a click. An emphasised full stop, or, rather, a question mark. So much remained unconfirmed. They assumed that Viktor was the assailant.

~

The next year, and the outcome was identical, the body of a middle-aged woman was found buried under snow, frozen stiff in position. It became apparent that the encounter followed the same structure as the previous man. However, there was one difference, that added a second question mark to the unpunctuated line of confusion. The women on the phone said that the man’s face, whom he later put to the name of ‘Viktor’, with notable pieces of flesh dangling

The authorities never caught the man, whose heart had stopped after spending one hour and fifty seven minutes in the snow, and whose body had never been found.

These attacks continue on the same day of the year, and this is not every time, the description of the man’s face and features indicates that he becomes more decayed, and that despite of his appearance, every year that person will open the door for that man, and the events of the previous year will repeat, with no foreseeable end – and with the evidence lying buried in the snow.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/lortm/a_russian_winter/
1307581597.0,hv46v,A Warning,gloomybear666,14,3,3,"I’m doing this for you. And for Mike

I suppose I should provide some background information first. I’m a sophomore in a fairly good university in Boston – no, I had the option to live in honors housing and decided to roll with it; after all, at least the people would be interesting. Whatever arcane algorithm they use to process roommate requests took in my preferences and spat out the name of my future roommate: Mike, just another random honors kid from St. Louis. The two of us got along fine for most of freshman year – my enjoyment of Miley Cyrus notwithstanding-and so we decided to room together sophomore year as well.

Now, only to later start watching random online episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000, and then begin working his way through the archives of the hottest new webcomic. And, of course, like any real obsessive, he would keep me posted on his latest craze. I humored him; what else are roommates for?

One day earlier this week, but whatever). I’d hear about a med student eating an arm, or someone being autopsied alive, or some random youtube video that will drive you insane. We usually had a good laugh about them.

The third day of this obsession, but something seemed a little off. His voice had a sharp edge to it. As the hour got later, his banter got more and more inane, as though he were talking just to stave off having to go to sleep. Eventually, I pointedly got into my bed and rolled over, effectively ending any further chance at conversation. I wish I hadn’t.

I sleep like a log, just guttural shrieks of pain. Instantly (don’t ask me how), I recognized the screams as Mike’s. I tried my best to run to him, but my feet just slid through the fog; I couldn’t get any real traction on the ground, if there indeed was any ground. The screams got further away and more indistinct, though I could still tell they were Mike’s. Eventually, they faded to nothing and I woke up.

And every last trace of Mike was gone from the room.

Everything. His laptop, the heap of trash he let accumulate on his half of the windowsill-everything. A thick layer of dust coated his entire side of the room. Absolutely nothing on my side of the room had been touched-nor had any of his stuff in the bathroom, the kitchen, or the living room of our suite. Only in the bedroom had anything been taken.

I couldn’t believe it. I prayed it was a dream. I pinched my elbow until the skin was red, who quickly brought in the Boston Police Department. I was immediately kicked out of the room so they could go over everything with a fine-toothed comb.

I think I must have been in shock. I felt completely numb, at any rate. When I popped open the laptop, however, a word document stared at me. Its text was the following:

‘I know this is stupid. I can’t help but think how much I’ll regret this in the morning, rituals, tales of scary places, and the like. I came across this…warning, I guess it was. I won’t say what, and I won’t say where, for fear of you finding it yourself. Suffice it to say it sent chills down my spine, as has become my habit

The warning stayed with me, waiting until I would focus on something else to rear its ugly head. This was irrational, I knew; my mind was just playing tricks on me. Some ancestral fear had been played upon, some age-old nightmare that was just that-a nightmare, no more and no less. But that didn’t make the fear go away. Only when I looked at the clock to see how long I had until you got back that it dawned on me I had passed the time alloted me by the warning to stop what was coming (any vagueness is out of concern for you, I promise).

And then the real anxiety kicked in. My palms started to sweat, I knew that the warning had been real. And I had failed to heed it. My time was limited.

It was about then that you got back from the TV station. I was so glad to see someone else, a companion against the now terrifying night. But clearly you weren’t interested; your yawns were a dead giveaway. You headed to bed, and I (to stave off sleep a little longer) decided to write you this. Do me a favor – if I’m wrong, forget this ever happened. If I’m right…warn them.’

So that’s what I’m doing. I’m warning you. Just be careful. Next time you go on an archive binge at creepypasta,” if you feel a chill run down your spine at some warning you’ve never read before you might want to heed it. If you decide not to, however – if you just click on your merry way-please tell Mike I’m sorry I couldn’t get to him in the fog.",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/hv46v/a_warning/

Over and over and OVER! The thing just keeps throwing itself into the wall. Knocking tiny pieces here and there

I’m recalling a crystal clear memory of putting on my make-up. I wore a full facial prosthetic that made my face look like a demonic boar. I attached it using a product called spirit gum. Basically, and the large tusks jutting from my lower jaw white with blood spots. I then added highlights and shadows to the low hanging brow that furrowed angrily in the middle. I held my eyelids open and inserted contacts that made my eyes completely white except for a tiny circle in the middle to see through. I put on a black trench coat with lots of metal pieces hanging from it in a uniform pattern, and finally slicked my hair back and out of the way. To complete my ensemble, I picked up my chainsaw.

Quickly getting closer!

SHIT!

The impact sends me sprawling backwards. Damn

I need to think and remember more quickly. I don’t know how much time I’ve got left. Something major happened that night. I definitely scared a chick I thought was hot. Her fight or flight reflexes kicked in, but she was particularly quick. OH! I was tasked with showing a duo of paranormal researchers around the park. I felt them being there was odd. Sure, first year haunters might freak out sometime because they think they saw something. With time everyone builds a tolerance to fear. They introduce themselves as Stacy and Clair, and they were HOT! Also, something else odd, they both were flirting with me. Like, odd touches here and there, we get the most action here.” Naturally, they seem much harder and are rattling my teeth. He’s going to get through

I’ve lead them behind one of the haunts. I’m showed them the secret actor doors that allow them to get to break areas without running into guests. They both continued to flirt with me. I was blushing like crazy! They can’t see it due to the glued on boar face! Ha! Seriously though

WHAT THE HELL? I JUST BLACKED OUT??? The memories just end! There’s nothing after that!

It’s laughing again, it’s enormous and covered in a thin fur. There’s drool falling from its lips that are turned up into what looks like a grin. What I previously thought were horns are actually the enormous tusks jutting from its jaw to its forehead, and ending at a needle tipped points just under its eyes. ITS EYES! They are completely white, and enormous with no pupil what so ever. It projects that awful laugh again. It stops and holds it’s eyes directly at mine.

“YOU MUST WATCH.”

Honestly, like someone blinking. Two heads come into view looking down at the screen. It’s Stacy and Clair with maniacal smiles on their faces. The person’s right hand comes in from the bottom of the screen, turning it over as if trying it out for the first time. Wait! That’s my hand! WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?? IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE ME?

“IT IS YOU

Wait! What are talking about?

“Are you there my Lord?” Clair is looking straight into the screen. The boar thing turns towards the screen.

“YES

I yell with all my might
Again

“HE BELIEVES YOU CAN HEAR HIM.”

He starts that hideous laughter again

He looks back to the screen. ""TELL HIM WHY.”

Stacy runs her finger tips slowly around my mouth. “We are his. We belong to him and no one else. We need him to walk the Earth again as he once did. We found your pictures on the haunts website.” Clair moves her left hand across Stacy’s side and says “When I saw them I noticed how similar you look to our Lord. I just knew he would have no trouble finding you. He now has an Earthly body.” Clair licks her lips and stretches them into an impossibly deep smile and says “Your body.” I see my hand move up to touch her and stroke her face softly.

“THERE IS JUST ONE THING YOU DID INCORRECTLY”

Clair and Stacy both freeze with a look of terror.

“YOU’VE CHOSEN SOMEONE WHO CAN THROW UP A BARRIER STRONGER THAN ANY IVE SEEN. THE POSSESSION IS ONLY COMPLETED WHEN THE BODIES OWNER COMPLETELY SUBMITS TO FEAR.”

She claimed at the time that she wanted to have a more ""boyish"" color. Something that would set her apart from all the girls in her class. The only remnants of her youthful pink-and-purple phase was a near empty plastic

This picture of her childhood teddy bear was positioned so that the bear's eyes darted across the room to her bed. Margaret had always claimed it made her feel safer at night. She felt protected when the bear was watching over her.

But Margaret never slept. Instead, her eyes grew sunken and dark, and her irritability began to concern her family. Margaret shrugged them off, saying that she was just having trouble falling asleep because of school-related stress. It would get better as time went on and she got used to her workload.
Months like this went by, and withdrew more and more from the outside world. She even started to keep a knife under her pillow. ""Just in case,"" she always thought. Eventually, it had to catch up to her. Eventually she had to sleep.

She did.

When she awoke

Margaret cowered into the corner of her bed as the figure moved closer. She heard a low whisper that was almost unintelligible but sounded almost as if the creature was speaking her name.

The figure reached an arm over the bed, and as the figure's hand touched Margaret's shoulder, she lunged out with the knife, stabbing the creature in the neck. The figure fell onto the bed, it's blood drenched neck soaking Margaret's feet.

Margaret raced off her bed, but her father, carrying a pile of paint swatches. He had hoped to suggest a new, more comforting color to her room.

With the adrenaline still pumping through her body, she had passed out on her floor, feet covered in blood, facing her dead father's body on her bed.

She awoke an hour later, she went to climb back into bed. She looked towards the picture of her favorite bear, hoping it would comfort her and relax her from the nightmare she just woke from.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

It is said that there are three ways that fear expresses itself: through physical reaction, for real terror to shine through you need the latter two, especially paranoia. You know the feeling right? Actually, let me clarify: you do know the feeling, you can recall it perfectly... 

Work has been hard today, you climb the stairs towards the comfort of a nice warm slumber. You reach the door of the bedroom and make sure everything is in order before turning out the lights. You walk to the bed, its loving grasp beckoning like an old friend. The comforter and top sheet peel away revealing a warm layer that fits snugly around your tired body. Closing your eyes, you start to drift off. Then you hear it: something. A scurry? A scratch? 

It’s just rats, why didn’t I pay the extra money for the rat poison? But somewhere deep in your mind you know this is no rat, you pull the warm blankets up to your face. You sit trying to talk yourself out of this childish fear of the dark. See it’s nothing I knew it, the grown-up in you smirks to your inner child, you got all worked up over some fat mouse. You lay back down confident of your power and dominion over your little living space. I need to stop staying up so late, you start to laugh, Ha—, then you’re interrupted.

You hear a bang on a door. Your door?  A car door down the block? You wait drifting further and further beneath the covers that you hope will keep you safe as you wait, you observe. 

You reach for your bedside stand, where’s a flashlight? You grope the drawers to no avail. You straighten up; legs rigid and unyielding paralyzed by fear. Still you manage to twist your body and lower your legs to the solid floor. The material feels cool to the touch. And as your spine extends to its full height, you can almost hear the creaking in now solidified joints. You stand up, your senses beginning to go into hyper vigilance as you hazard your first step across the floor. You step to the foot of your bed, wary of your surroundings as if you have never been in this room before.

You close the closet door because you can feel it watching you from the darkness behind your slightly crumpled shirts hanging in a row. It? You wonder what you mean it. How do you know it

You throw the curtains open and look out the window, you wonder, but you realize it doesn’t. It’s just your brain making faces where there are none… causing you to fabricate monsters lurking in the dark. What do they call that? You know this; you got an ‘A’ on that quiz in Psych. It’s the same phenomenon that causes people to see Jesus on their toast and the Elvis in their toilet bowl.

Pareidolia

You shake your head of the callipygian goddess and as you glance around the darkness of the room
With your room now apparently safe from threats

“Hey motherfucker if you’re out there I’m armed

“Hello, that sounded pathetic. You walk further down the hall, arm still cocked back at the ready.  You reach the change in flooring the boards giving way under your weight, moaning and creaking like the monster you’re determined to find. 

Brrreeep. You jump out of your skin, it seems the harsh noise was your phone’s death cry as the screen turns to black. The only light in the corridor now the flashing pinpoint of red emanating from your phone’s plastic cover. Damn, you think trying to remember where you left that charger.  

You creep farther and farther down the hall

“Ah hah

“Meow, grow a pair, you think making a mental note. 

This is ridiculous you plead I’m a rational human being not some loony nut job. But the curiosity in you is just determined to kill the cat. And was that a pair of eyes staring at you from above the fridge? 

You trip over a dumbbell that your friend left lying on the floor

Your process is slow but steady as you try to “clear” every room in the house before willing to give up the late night goose chase. You check room after room, my neighbors must think I’m nuts lighting up the whole street at this hour. And even though the front door is locked you decide to poke your head outside just to make extra sure. Satisfied that there appears to be no abomination prowling the curb, you retreat back inside.

You lock the front door; double
access to the outdoors, you’ve made enough progress to be within an arm’s reach of the bedroom’s dazzling light. 

You hurry in and lock the bedroom door knowing that the house is clear, the window curtains are drawn shut, you can see that all the clothes hanging in the closet are in order. So you turn out the lights and climb into bed clamoring back to the safety found under covers. 

And it’s only as the lights flicker out that you remember that you closed the closet door…

I was going away for the weekend with my mother just to get a break from it all, he would have to be a fool not to"" she agreed with me and then began talking about other things. When we finally reached our destination we hopped out of the bus and went to the side where the compartment was to get our bags when we noticed that the door was already open. This meant that the bus driver had left the door open throughout the entire journey. ""god dammit! Help me look to see if any bags went missing"" I sighed. My mother and I counted the bags, then I heard the person on the other end hang up. I hung up and sat on the bed
""Yeah maybe, terrible thoughts and images of who or what called me in my mind. I almost got to sleep when I heard a loud banging at the hotel room door. I sprang up in bed and quickly went to see who it was. I looked through the peep hole and saw no one, I opened the door and looked to see if anyone was there, and still no one was around. I sighed and went back into the room forgetting to lock the door behind me. I got back into bed and tried to rest for at least an hour before I had to get up. When I opened my eyes I saw my mother's bed covered in blood. I quickly ran over to her bed and pulled the covers off. And what I saw will haunt me for the rest of my life. In the bed I saw the dismembered corpse of my mother, I screamed and nearly vomited from the sight. I turned to grab the phone to call 911 and saw my missing purse on the table. I looked in the purse and saw a heart, the heart of my mother on top of the heart there was a small note saying ""I decided to return your purse, just thought it was right thing to do.

It was only ever supposed to be a walk home

But on that night

It happened

I lived in Cumberland

I remember that we would always play there during the daytime. It would only usually last from 11:00 to 1:00. After 1:00 the woods wasn't the best place to be

When I was walking by after buying the milk I stopped for a second to just look into the woods. I don't know why but I couldn't control it. I just kinda stopped. I was only there for maybe 30 seconds.... Or god knows how long. It's actually hard to remember. I usually try not to think about that, looking into the dark abyss that inhabited those dreaded woods. I just stared at them.

But then I noticed ""it"". It was standing there. Right at the border of the moonlight and the dark woods. I froze. I didn't know what to do. If I ran it would have surely caught up to me. If I attacked it, it was like a blank, black slate. It was grotesque to look at though, I felt nauseous even knowing about it. Just the thought of it in general was nauseating. I don't know how that could even happen though, it was just a black tall figure.

Well, it's fucking height seemed to stretch on until it reached the atmosphere.

But I didn't know what to do. I just stood there. I only stood there because I didn't know how to react. Not even anything I've seen on tv before could match those horrors. I only remember standing there for about 5 seconds, when i got up I looked around me. There was these trees, they weren't from around there though, because I remember going up and feeling the bark on the trees. 

They were Redwoods, because after touching the bark I had... I think I had blood on my hands, at first being at such a young age I thought ""Who's spilling ketchup all on these trees?"". Of course being 11 I tried finding a reasonable explanation to the ""ketchup"" on the trees, but I quickly decided to leave it be. 

Eventually, I didn't know  what to do. I just ran, I only ran. I didn't even want to look back, knowing that ""it"" could be there. While I was running I saw a hole, it was pretty big. For some odd reason I stopped and examined it, it was a long drop I could tell, I couldn't see the bottom of it. I was only there for a few seconds when I heard some twigs snap behind me from where I came from, I ran faster than I ever have

As I was running I saw things in the corner of my eyes, faster than I was. I still don't know what those were though. And I don't ever want to know. I also heard the voices and laughter of kids as I was running. The voices, they were calling my name. They wouldn't stop calling. I didn't know where it was coming from though, it was all around me. I didn't want to think about it.

Then I tripped. I didn't pay attention to the objects on the ground and only to the things in front of me. I felt a huge amount of pain and throbbing in my head. After I tripped I immediately looked up. I was home. Close at least. I wounded up on the side of Henry's house and next to his backyard. As I soon came to the realization that I made it, I eventually reached home.

Now, OH and have a nice steady job. I was reminded of my experience and decided to research it. I actually had to stay up all night getting to the bottom of this and call in sick for work  the next day. I recently found out that in that county in Cumberland, ME had tons of reports recalling missing kids. All of them were around my area and a few in my town too actually. About 17 kids went missing, and they were never found. But eventually in the years to follow around the time I was right in the middle of High-School they sent out a rescue team to find all these missing kids. They did find the kids though, but they were all deceased. Mangled and torn up. They found the bodies inside of a pit with a 10ft. drop. On one of the kids torsos they found what resembled satanic symbols. But weren't of that origin. Even though I found out about that pit I came across. It said nothing about the Redwoods being there.

I'm only writing this because I'm going on a major camping trip with a group of friends. I'm brining my .45 with me just in case anything happens. And to also worn you and anyone else about the dangers that could inhabit those woods. Just stay away from those woods. My friends are to ignorant to listen to what I have to say about them. I'm only going to protect them. Just for protection.

It all started with a picture my friend texted me. http://static2.fjcdn.com/comments/All+hail+our+savior+and+leader.+Shrek+is+love+shrek+_013e3eeabaf949cb192b6a217ed821f5.jpg. It didn’t seem like anything bad at the time. Just another funny picture. I sent it to all of my other friends as well; soon enough we started sending more copies of that picture to everyone. Like dozens at a time. Still; it didn’t seem like anything bad.
	
Then my friend found this picture http://25.media.tumblr.com/4f9c90b09f6236c6525acf9966f6947e/tumblr_mgpp61iEL91qmg0kfo1_500.png When I first saw it, but we had seen much more messed up stuff, so I didn’t think much of it.
	
Pretty soon
	What happened next caused everything else to fall into play.
	
The same friend discovered that some people had set up an organization on the Internet.
	
That organization was called the Church of Shrek.
	
We all thought that this was hilarious. We began spreading even more Shrek pictures to each other. We began saying Shrek jokes and puns, or when trying to be funny. We didn’t think that there was anything wrong with it. We didn’t think that anything could happen just from saying Shrek jokes.
	
We didn’t think that anything would change.
	
Shrek started becoming more and more popular
	
But it all went ogre the line when the computers became involved.
	
When we weren’t in class, people didn’t often work there, and you could even play video games without being disturbed if you wanted.
	
The upper library also had computers.
	
On that fateful day
	
My friends and I all thought that this was hilarious. We started changing the desktop backgrounds whenever we could to funny pictures. One other notable picture used was this http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/hf52YJtWdRs/mqdefault.jpg
	
Like the Shrek jokes, the pictures were clean and they served as a small laugh to someone before they started on their essay; almost as motivation.
	
By this point we had nearly forgotten Shrek. Or so we thought.
	
About two weeks after I first changed the desktop background on one of the computers
	
Suddenly
	
It was Shrek
	
As I looked over at my computer sitting on my nearby desk
	
We had to spread it.
	
The word of Shrek.
	
The next day we started changing the desktop backgrounds, with the first part about how the Russians managed to keep their Orthodox religion throughout the Middle Ages, and the second part instructing us to create a fake religion and talk about how we would spread it.
	
My religion was, entitled The Old Shrekstament and The New Shrekstament. Eventually, after gathering a fairly large group of followers (the Brogres), people would start hearing faint whispers saying, “It’s all ogre now.” Shrek would start murdering people in the middle of the night; a bloody onion as well as the words “He/she should have checked him/herself before he/she Shreked him/herself.” People would then start reporting seeing a large green figure escaping from a bedroom window. These Shrek sightings would increase in number until May 18, 2016. Exactly fifteen years after the first Shrek movie was released.
	
On that day
	
After securing the building
	
That shrine would be constructed of onions dipped in human blood.
	
Our lord Shrek would recognize this offering and call down a storm of giant onions to destroy the Earth. All would die
	
My teacher gave me an A+ on the essay.
	
We took this as a sign, and to worship Shrek as our lord.
	
Finally, everything we had worked so hard for came crashing down.
	
We changed one more desktop background
	
The funny thing is that that last picture that I changed the desktop background to was the first Shrek picture I had ever received. That which started it also ended it.
	
Shrek is love

I was browsing a forum, a post about a surviving dwemer, and a post about an alien space ship. (All hoaxes) but then, something caught my eye. Something slightly believable. Apparently, if you beat the game on the hardest difficulty, without dying, six times in a row, when you started another new game, and wander that spot until dusk. His name was apparently Ryphjot, Ryphjot would never spawn again in the entire game


This seemed like a complete hoax to me. Why would the developers put something that obscure into the game? I would much rather go on the 'Bug-in-a-Jar' wild goose chase, sure enough, there were none. There were a bunch of comments on the post, calling bullshit as well. I quit out of Firefox, and began playing some Galactic Civilizations II.


When I went to bed that night, in the back of my mind, keeping me awake. Could Ryphjot actually be real? Of course not, it would be way too hard to find him! And yet, a small part of me wanted to find out.


The next moring, then went to work. When i got back, I booted up my awesome Gaming PC, and started Skyrim. I played a couple quests, found some gold, got some new gear, and just generally kicked ass. Then, but i saved my game


Fast forward two months, trying to beat it over and over again. I'm on my fifth playthrough in a row, without dying, on the hardest difficulty, without quitting out at all. Fifth playthrough, in attempt 128. I'm determined to beat it this time, but it's damn hard. Whenever I go to bed, without turning off my computer. Thank god for minimizing.


A week has passed, without quitting the game out, on the hardest difficulty, without dying. What the fuck am i doing with my life? I'm a grown man! I'm not living in my mom's basement, i have a full-time job, and I have a girlfriend! But, this obsession has been causing problems, and my girlfriend has been going to ""Girl's night out"" with her ""Friends"". I'm afraid she's cheating on me.


I started another new game, that Ryphjot is just a hoax. Then, one day while I was wandering through the outskirts of Whiterun, I saw something. A nord, clad in steel armor, walking across the top of a hill. It was almost sundown, I sprinted towards him. When I got to him, something to show for my effort! I talked to him, he responded with ""Yes,"" The conversation window exited


I walked back to Whiterun, and the doors to their houses were locked. I saved, and tried picking a few, hoping to attract some guards. But, whenever I tried to pick the lock to one of their houses, I was given a message saying 'You cannot pick locks, you are doing a quest.' I thought this was odd, even while in quests! I eventually gave up looking for people, and saw the dark sillhouette of Alduin


I walked to the throat of the world, and it was unlocked. I got inside, and I saw the greybeards, standing there, facing me. I walked up to one of them and I talked to him. He said, in his usualt voice, ""dovahkiin, and ""No."". Of course, which was strange, and I felt like I was really excited to fight Alduin


It was insanely difficult, and I absorbed his soul. Then, I was teleported to the edge of the Throat of the World, and Ryphjot appeared infront of me. I suddenly felt very sad, for some reason, and Ryphjot said ""Thank you."" Then, he stabbed my character in the chest, the game exited to the title


Epilogue:

The next morning, except that my character had a new weapon, a daedric sword. it was called 'Ryphjot's Reward', and it was mad powerful. it did 9,999,999 damage per hit, and sold for a million gold. But, all the NPCs fled from me

I don't know why the developers would put something like this into the game...

     I took it as my imagination and moved on. But for the rest of the day I couldn't shake the feeling that someone or something was watching me. Man was I right. When I finally got to my friends house, but like any normal 15 year old boy, that's exactly what I did. There it was again, in the trees, just like before. The face. First I saw its chin, it appeared to be a normal persons chin. Then the mouth. Normal, exept for the demonic smile that told me that this thing took a sick pleasure in killing. Then th nose,psychopathic,and my blood. 
     The face was evil, from the face. But I will never understand why John just looked at me...and smiled. That same evil smile that the face has. It was at that moment that I looked in my friends eyes and saw a terrified boy in them. Screaming, screaming for me to save him. There was nothing I could do. I saw that kid inside, the kid I had been friends with since third grade, be killed and ripped apart inside his own body. I turned an ran. I ran as fast as I could and didn't stop.

My character nodded and said ""Look where youve got me. Look at all the pokemon you have killed. I am not the monster you are. See you in hell fucker!"" The game went black once again, Mario, Burnout someone with a mic or even in the game will always say ""You're the monster not me"".



EPILOGUE
The game was recalled once I told KO games about my experience. KO games also closed down when there was a fire that burnt it down exactly one week after my experience. The strangest part is nobody else had the same problem as me. A few people still may own it today but I know that a lot of kids that were scared of my experience destroyed it in fear. It is a collector's item now and is worth over 25, just sometimes when he talks to people they will say ""You're the monster not me"".",,False,self,t5_2rkx4,False,,

	My story begins on a road in the Mojave Desert. I was driving from my home in San Jose to Vegas in my old convertible. It was around 6 at night and the sun was beginning to set. The cool air of summer blew through my hair and I took a deep breath. I don’t know how long I was driving, or I should’ve at least seen some buildings or signs. 
“Had I taken a wrong turn?” I thought to myself. 
I concluded that that couldn’t be possible, as if something knew I had to stop somewhere for the night. I pulled into a parking spot and walked to the front door. Hanging about the door was a lit up sign that read ‘HOTEL CALIFORNIA’. A woman opened the door and stood in the doorway with a lit candle. 
“Hello
“Yes
She smiled at me. I could never forget her smile
“Plenty of room at the Hotel California
She led me to the front desk and checked me in. 
“Now
“Welcome to the Hotel California, any time of year, you can find it here. 
I dismissed the singing as just being a recording coming through speakers in the walls. Why would the guests sing about how lovely the hotel was every time someone checked in? We got to the room and she opened the door. 
“Have a nice sleep
I mumbled something and passed out on the bed
I woke up the next morning
“Why do you dance?” she asked. 
“What?” I asked
“Why do you dance?” she asked again. “Some dance to remember
I pondered her question for a few seconds. 
“When I dance I don’t usually think about anything
She nodded. 
“I dance to remember
“What about your life changed?” I asked her. “How is it different?” 
“Well
“That’s fine
“Thank you, would you like to join me for lunch?” 
“Lunch?” I asked
“Noon.” 
“Wow, I am hungry.” 
She walked with me to  the dining room and we sat down. The food was absolutely delicious
“Very good sir
I was astonished to say the least. No one has requested wine in this hotel for 36 years? Surely he must be joking
I awoke in the middle of the night. I turned my head groggily to look at the clock. 2:37 a.m. I groaned and stared up at the ceiling. In the silence I heard faint chanting. As I focused on the noise I realized that it was the song that the guests had sung when I had first came to this place. 
“Welcome to the Hotel California…” 
The words were the same but the tone was… different. There wasn’t any enthusiasm in the voices
“What’s with the chanting?” I asked. 
“The guests tend to do that
She led me to the staff lounge. It was a very impressive lounge, and a bar. There were also darts boards and a billiard table. The most interesting part of this lounge however, was the ceiling. The entirety of the ceiling was covered with many different mirrors. It was a very interesting decoration, and it really set a mood for the room. The woman had me sit on a couch while she went to the bar. She came back with glasses filled with a pink liquid. 
“Pink champagne on ice?” she asked. 
I nodded and took one of the glasses
“Now
She sighed. 
“I guess I probably should tell you
“Prisoners? What are you talking about? No one is in chains
 “This hotel doesn’t appear to many people
“What?!” I demanded. “Are you high or something? You are acting as if this hotel is a living thing!” 
“No
“Cursed? Why?” 
“No one really knows
“How do you lift the curse?” 
“When the curse was placed a demon appeared in the master’s chambers. From what we know if the demon was killed the curse would be killed along with it.” 
“So why not just kill it?” 
“What do you think we have been trying to do? Ever other night all of the staff go into the demon’s room and stab it with knives all night. There seems to be no way to stop it. There’s no escape.” 
I had enough of listening to this. I ran out of the room and down the hall. Whether or not she was telling the truth didn’t matter
“Relax
I sprinted out to my car and took off down the road. Not in a few minutes I saw the lights of Vegas. Finally! Now my vacation can continue! As I let out a sigh of relief I saw another car coming down the road. It was heading right for me! I tried to swerve out of the way but I wasn’t fast enough. It struck me and I immediately blacked out. 
I awoke in a hospital bed to the sound of a woman’s voice. 
“Well
I opened my eyes fully and looked at the woman standing at the side of my bed. By how she was dressed I could easily assume she was a nurse. I looked up to see her face. She smiled at me. I could never forget her smile

I walked up to the kitchen door slowly, it just stood there, continuing to go through the kitchen for food/pills/or whatever it wanted. It then, looked at me.

It just stood there with it's expressionless face. It's body like nothing I'd ever seen before. It had a slender body, but not severely. It charged at me, I was still no match for this monster with my bare hands. 

I slowly backed into the corner as it tried to slash at me. I couldn't stall any longer. I jabbed at it with my fists, as it felt like it was on fire. I didn't have time to attend to my hand, so I went to the counter and picked up a meat clever with my good hand. I knew this wasn't going to end pretty, but I had to put up a fight.

 I wasn't as coordinated with my left hand as I was with my right. I went for a stab and he'd just block it with it's hands. I chopped again and it blocked again, it stabbed me with one of it's knives. I quickly jumped back in agony, I tried to run, but it was just faster. I reached the end of the hallway to the door of my parets room. It was coming onto me, without thinking, I threw my clever and it hit it right in the head. It cried out in agony, and fell to the ground.

okay, i think it was a featured story somewhere or something at that time. 

it was basically about a guy who moves in with another guy

the first guys roomate starts becoming obsessed with a certain person, and all these people he knows are bringing up this name/asking about this name. maybe chanting it? 

and at the end the roommate either commits suicide or is beaten to death or something presumably at the hands of this person or name. 


for some reason this story has started to mingle with fight club in my mind. and i keep thinking ""his name was tyler durden"" but of course that's not right.

i am very sorry for my marijuana-fueled ramblings

1346852649.0,ze4t8,The Painting in the Shed,FlackBotter,13,3,5,"  I remember as a small girl always being horrified by the stained, but it lived in the shed

  The picture – it was horrifying, even as a child I could see how rushed and fanatic the art was. In it sat a woman on top of a wardrobe, uncomfortably hunched, naked, a look of pain on her face as her legs and arms draped down beside her. Below my pained lady, in front of the wardrobe, an old crone stood, until the leg was black and blighted. While the lady looked into the distance

  I was barred from the shed as it was deemed a general safety hazard, I would stare at this picture for hours - perhaps it was minutes, it's hard to say how a length of time feels to a child. That painting was engrained in my memory, every detail of that hellish scene, as I absorbed what to my child-like mind was forbidden knowledge. 

  The painting was a fixture of that shed, or if there was an artist's signature hidden somewhere therein, even if there was I would not have been able to read it. That painting disappeared, and like all children I accepted that, and never thought of it again. It was only until years later I remembered it while mulling in my room, and asked about it origins.

  “A painting?” my mother replied

  “Yes, one on a wardrobe with a black leg.”

  “John!” My mother screeched

  “What painting?” My father asked.

  “From years ago!” My mother shouted back.

  My father came plodding through into the kitchen, that painting Chris painted?”

  “Oh, “your Uncle Chris, Beth, he had a painting that was in the shed. It was of your room.”

  “My room!” I was horrified

  “Before we painted everything over in pink,” he laughed at that.

  “That was nowhere near normal

  “You should have seen some of the stuff he painted when he was alive

  Slowly what my father was saying dawned on me

  “There were no women, back when he was here for rehabilitation. I told him to paint something that might sell!”

  “She'd have been too young to remember, “Chris lived in your room for a while after living on the streets, you were still in the crib in our room.”

  My mind began to whirr as I tried to remember what I knew of Uncle Chris

  “Not unless your room is a field is Norfolk
  There were a few moments of what felt like uncomfortable silence,” my father said,  “his hands were always shaking when he painted it,” he shook his head, “I'm surprised you still remember it.”

  Upstairs, only pink and wood chips came up beneath my fingernails. But sure enough, the wardrobe was the right size and shape, and was even the right part of the room, fixed to the wall. A cold chill went down my spine as I considered the picture, the placing of the closet, and the window. Was there anything outside the window in the picture? I couldn't remember, it was clear why the lady sitting would be so hunched. 

  And yet my family didn't remember people in the painting at all

  I wondered about my Uncle Chris, though not what; I knew he shot himself in the head, but not why. He painted, but was never successful -  and until today I had never seen one painting by him, or thought I hadn't. A few thoughts went through my head, was Chris a fan of the grotesque or addled in the brain?

  I dismissed the latter option immediately, because he was an artist.
  
  But then why did no one else see what was in the picture?

  I looked at the wardrobe

  A mad thought swept me. I placed my wooden chair – now an unhealthy peeling pink – beside the wardrobe, pressed against the wall so that it was hidden from view from where Chris would have sat. I pulled off posters and removed the rug, until the scene looked bare. A spare room a homeless man might find respite in. There. There was the scene, picture perfect. 

  Now another mad thought took me. Balancing on my good leg

  Sitting up there, but madly, with a frenzy of brush strokes as oil was stacked upon oil. I imagined a frenzied painter mad, unshaven, looking up fervently, scared of what he saw but driven to finish it.

  A sudden realization took me. I looked down at my own legs, would match in orientation to my own prosthetic limb.

  I felt for the seam in my jeans. Just below the knee. Yes

  My hands gripped the lip of the wardrobe until my knuckles turned white. Ideas began to run through my head. I was run over by a geriatric driver in two thousand and seven. I lost my right leg. It was a woman, apparently.

Did the naked, and I have never slept in the same room since.

1326807796.0,oktbs,The Red Door,bigmanbeardy,13,4,8,"I met the man around 10:00 AM. I got in his car, and when we slammed the car doors you could hear them echo off of houses farther down the road. The sky was pale.  
We went up the frozen front walk and he hurried past me to unlock the door for us. He was a tall man with a nice black overcoat. I shivered a bit in my neck. I only had on my Patriots jacket and it was a little too cold. He pulled the door open and nodded at me politely and I stepped into the house. I stopped at the entrance and looked around.  
“I'm sorry
I was blocking his way. I took one one step farther and looked around more. He shoulder brushed up against my back as he closed the door. It came closed with a clink.  
“Well,” he said.  
“Yeah
“So
My jaw kind of moved around instead of saying anything.  
“This is it
I nodded.  
“It's not anything you're looking at, some pictures on the wall, a TV, little coffee table. But so does every other house in America. That's not how you know. No. It's the smell, isn't it? It's the smell.” He took a big sniff and frowned and nodded his head like he was understanding something. “Yeah. They've got two little kids. You can tell. That baby powder diaper smell or whatever it is. That medicine fragrance smell trying to cover up another smell. And the smell of the carpet, the wood. Hey, come here
He took a few steps into the living room and waved his hand for me to follow him. He was wearing black gloves. I still had my hands shoved in my pockets even though it was pretty warm in the house. I took them out and followed him. We went straight through the living room to the kitchen. It was a really small house. There were wood counters
“Come on
I followed.  
“This is it
There was a green pack of Marlboros sitting on the ledge in by the dish soap. There was still about half a pack left. I could feel my eyelids getting tight and my lips setting in their place. I didn't really want to give anything away to this guy so I just nodded.  
“You wanna go upstairs? You remember what's upstairs, though, right?”  
I didn't nod this time.  
“Come on
He grabbed on the sleeve of my Patriots jacket and nodded for us to leave the kitchen. He didn't pull on my sleeve. I followed him. We went out of the kitchen through the other door to the back hall. There was a door going out to the backyard and another door.  
“Why go upstairs
He opened up the other door and my hand clenched. It was dark inside. He flipped a switch and a little fluorescent light came on overhead. A set of wooden stairs went down between two white cinder block walls to a small red door. I could feel my heart beating in my chest now.  
“Yeah, 'basement.' It smells like a basement to me.”  
He let go of my sleeve.  
“Go on
I went down the stairs. It was all so much smaller and more cramped than it should be. I could put my hands on both walls and still have my arms halfway bent. Too narrow. And it wasn't deep enough. There was only about 15 stairs
I thought he'd go on about smells
“Take your time
He was trying to sound patient and understanding and it annoyed me a bit. After dragging me here
“You know what's behind that door
Now this was annoying. Ever since I had agreed to meet him, he'd say, this is where she'd smoke Marlboro Menthols, and here's where the Nintendo was. As if he new the first fucking thing. He pretended like he knew everything about this house.  
“You know what's behind that door. Open it
My vision blurred. I put my head down a bit and made sure my shoulders were really still. I wasn't going to let him know I was crying. I didn't weep or sob or anything. But tears were running down my face and dripping on the zippers of my jacket.  
“Open that door
I knew he was looking at the back of my head. What was he seeing? The head of a stocky 32 year old man with light brown hair. I hadn't gotten a haircut in a while. I got my haircuts about once a month but sometimes I let it slide. It probably looked pretty shaggy now. It had been maybe two months.  
“You have to open that door
I knew what he saw when he was looking at me. I wasn't really stocky. I was just fat now. Especially in this puffy Patriots jacket. My shoulders sagged. I had bad posture. I looked like a sad sack
“Open it
“I can't open that door
He put his hand on my back. I pushed back a bit but it was like there was a wall behind me. The door opened from the inside. I saw the old white hand holding the inside knob and I saw the sleeve of the blue sweater. I knew what that sweater smelled like.

1321819278.0,mj9rg,The Scottish Highlands,Juggernog,15,6,4,"In the Scottish highlands in the early fourteenth century, was that their leader was named ‘Vanca’

Old evidence suggests Vanca’s group were widely known for their notorious cannabilism, not that it’d matter, as the sheer speed of the groups attacks didn’t leave much time for any action to be taken.

One diary entry by a peasant in Edinburgh gives a detailed report of an attack, her writing was not verified or even evaluated for accuracy – it was a personal diary that she kept. The descriptions were as followed:

“On the trade route today, apart from a hovering shroud of fog. This area of the mountains never gets foggy. Then it happened – quickly, and without remorse, these merchants were attacked by a party of perhaps fifteen men. They were pulled out of their vehicles by shadows of men, silhouettes amongst the falling sun in the background, stabbed, and pulled into the fog where they vanished - leaving only a trail of blood

The authorities of the time dismissed her claims, and her claims dismissed. The merchants cart was recorded and towed away in 1402, fifty years after the incident, the food cart left to rot – the road was reportedly very rarely used.

In 1409, were sentenced to death without fair trial – they were hung at the gallows in the centre of Edinburgh according to multiple diary accounts, including the executioners, who reported feeling a distinct ‘dread’ they had never felt before in their lives when executing these criminals. The hangings were never officially recorded, but the sheer number of reports suggests that it did, in fact, happen.

After this, this is unlikely to be a case of laziness from the law enforcement.

No similar cases were recorded for years, a very thick shroud of fog and mist lay over the mountains, reducing visibility to almost zero, as a large convoy carrying a felon who was regarded as very dangerous was passing through the mountains. The convoy dropped off the radar, all radio communication was lost, transmitting only an eerie static to the government, who had implemented the radio to continuously check up on the drivers and police officers on board.

When they were over three hours late for their arrival at the prison

When they arrived at the scene, and some traces of blood on the vehicle, and a long bloodstain leading away from the vehicles, before abruptly stopping at approximately the same distances from the vehicles, as if they evaporated into thin air. The police still suspected the felon, until they discovered such a gruesome spectacle that its presence was never released to the general public.

They found the bodies of Officer Wilson, Officer Spencer and the felon, hung from a noose attached to a tree, their bodies half eaten. Their bodies were quickly covered up, and the blood, as well as any other potentially disturbing articles, where removed from the scene – many of the articles cleaned up where not detailed in the report, and kept as evidence.

From here, all the people in the area of 60m were attacked and found hanging from the tree. In the attack of 1982 everyone in the area of 120m was attacked, and by 1983, everyone in the area of 240m were brutally attacked.

At the rate of the increase of area  noted between years of attack, I suggest that we issue a public safety announcement to look all the doors and windows during times of mist, as the six hundred victims of this years attack were all taken both from their homes and from their vehicles, only to be found partially cannibalized over the coming days, hanging from a noose in a nearby tree. Nowhere is safe.

1376611623.0,1kge10,No Hope For the Forever Lost,krispers21,13,3,0,"“I don't know why I’m here. I just figured it was time to get some help. I don't even know if I’m crazy- probably am though. And you'd think that it's because of the fact that I’m not certain of who or where I am anymore. Or the shadows I keep seeing. Or even the whispers of sound

I had a perfectly normal life. I would wake up and head back to work, and ignoring every other person doing their own thing in the crowded city. I’d grab a coffee, and do as little as possible in the depressing cubicle where I spent the next 8 hours. I’d meet some friends on the weekends, and we'd go out to the imitation Irish pubs to complain about our week, or to play pool or something. 

But this one Tuesday- I remember because it was on Labour Day of last year, I was on the way home. Again the homeless woman held out her hand, but I had gotten rid of my change at lunch. I thought she might understand, since I had been so generous before. But her usually shy son stood up, like he never had in front of me before. He spat a word at me- something that wasn’t English- and glared with a rage that made me think I saw a glint of red in his eyes. I shivered but carried on, knowing that I tried my best. 

But I know now that it was definitely more significant than I thought, watching the football game. We all just cheered and took big gulps of beer in celebration of the home team's third touchdown. With my glass drained, I rapped my knuckles on the counter to signal to the bartender that I needed another. And the response I heard was from a fancy-looking waiter behind me saying ""ooh, that's risky."" I blinked and found myself sitting at a casino. Evidently I was playing blackjack, because the dealer put another card in front of me as tapping the table like I had done is also an indicator for another card. Here I panicked. I dropped the cards, looked around for anyone or anything I knew. It was all completely unfamiliar. I started to sweat and had no way to respond to the concerned expressions of those around me. I stammered a question to the waiter, and found out that I was staying in a hotel room above the casino, locating it using the room card in my pocket. Running down the long hallway, which I definitely was still in, and judging from the state of messiness

Over the next day, but found that I had lost most of my money gambling, and that I was in a different country. When I called anyone I knew from before, all their phone lines were dead. The only thing I could do was to try and win some money back, or find someone who would help. By the evening, I was talking to a friendly, older gentleman at the reception, of course
I sat in his Cadillac, and shook it in order to have it spread out so I could read it. However, as I did so, it became soft in my hands. The map had turned into a pillow I was fluffing, and when I looked beyond it, and found that I was back in my girlfriend's apartment. She was watching TV on the bed, and it seemed that I was about to join her. This couldn't be happening again. She asked me why I stopped moving and was staring out of the window at the snow. SNOW. In September? That wasn't normal where I was from. Not even close, but everything else was the same. And there was no way everything was normal again after my gambling escapade. It was much too real and long to be a dream

I trusted my girlfriend. She might believe me, it happened again. A white wall became a bright headlight that was about to hit the car I was driving. I swerved out of the way, and blinked my eyes until I could clearly see the countryside stretching out on every side of me. That was the point I thought there was no hope. There was no base for anything anymore; everything I knew, or trusted, or believed didn’t exist or make sense. And I figured that the only way to beat a game with no rules was to quit. 

The first thing I tried was standing in the middle of the road with my arms stretched out and my eyes closed. But the only time I heard a car approaching and honking was instantly replaced with a loud whooshing of air and the feeling that my stomach had dropped out. I opened my eyes and found myself skydiving. Before I could intentionally hit the ground though

This has been going on for I-don’t-even-know how long now. But at least I’ve finally made it here doctor. And that’s my story. Please tell me there’s something you can do.”

The psychologist stopped taking notes for the last part of the story, walks over to his desk, and pulls out a few coins. Baffled, I watch him pour them into my palm. He says, “That’s all it takes,” and smiles. But not in a good way. Actually, it looks more like a leer. I look into my palm and back at him, sitting in the snow. Which is all I can see for miles.

The Mother and the Businessman emerge on the ground floor.  They see the Captain and Flight Attendants approaching the glass entrance doors to the hotel.

The doors are locked.

The Captain futilely bangs against the glass.

“Have you seen my daughter...?”

The aircrew turns as the Mother and Businessman approach.

Older Flight Attendant: “We haven’t seen your daughter

Suddenly

The Daughter runs across the parking lot as if being chased.

The Mother rushes the glass, draws his gun and starts shooting at the glass.  Spider web cracks splay out from each bullet impact but the glass remains intact.  He kicks at the shattered glass but it won’t budge.
The Older Flight Attendant begins to break down.  “What are they doing to us...?”

The Mother turns back toward the lobby.  Notices a door marked

SECURITY ROOM

She heads for it...

● ● ●

A small bank of monitors sits in the windowless security room.  This is not the same surveillance room we saw earlier.  These are not the same cameras we’ve been viewing throughout.  They cover far less ground

The Mother and the Businessman investigate the room alone.

The Mother shakes her head.  “This isn’t it.”

“What do you mean?”

“These aren’t the surveillance cameras from the rooms.”

“You think there’s another security room in here?”

She notices a section of wall where the paint doesn’t match.  She presses her hands against it.  Lays an ear against the flat surface.  The wall opens like a sliding door

● ● ●

Out in the lobby

The Younger calmly rises to her feet.  Starts to walk back toward the elevators.

The Captain and the Older rise and follow her.  As if they were all sleepwalking.

● ● ●

The Mother and the Businessman enter the hidden chamber beyond the false security room.  The only light source spills from the room they just left.  In the darkness

“What is this...?”

Overhead lights suddenly flicker on

A lab.  Or a butcher shop.

Bleached human skeletons litter the floor and a series of metal tables.  Large

The Mother tries to back away from the horror but there’s nowhere to turn.  “What are they doing here...?”

Another hotel staff member is suddenly standing at the entrance.  Wearing a security uniform.  Face in shadow

The Businessman pulls his gun – unloads his entire clip into the man...

The bullet-ridden security guard stands for a moment longer as the smoke settles.  Then drops to his knees before collapsing on his face.

The Mother looks down at the body in horror.  Looks up at the Businessman.  “You killed him.”

The Businessman stares at the body

“How do you know that?!”

“He looked like one of Them...”

The Mother elbows the Businessman in the gut.  He doubles over and his glasses fall to the ground.  She steps on them as she runs out of the room.

● ● ●

Back in the lobby

The Businessman clumsily chases after the Mother

“You stay the hell away from me.”  She backs up against the locked glass doors.  Behind her

The Businessman advances

Just off to the side of the lobby

A dormant fireplace has lit up with a fresh pile of burning wood.

The Daughter sits in a reclining chair before the fire

The Mother rushes to her.  “What did they do to you??”

The Daughter speaks with a measured cadence: 

“I’m all right

Pulses of white light flood through the windows...

● ● ●

The Captain lies alone in his room.  Eyes open.

The Flight Attendants lie in their beds.  Eyes open.

The Mother and Daughter lie in their bed.  Eyes open.

The Businessman in his room.  Eyes open.

Staff members emerge from the corners of each room.  From closets.  From darkness.  From the edges of surveillance camera frames.  Some emerge from beneath beds.  They all wear varying staff uniforms.  A longer look at them betrays something that’s not quite right.  As if their flesh were a costume that doesn’t fit.  Their faces are fixed masks

Some are holding strange operating tools.  The curious sound of children’s laughter rises again... but it’s not really children’s laughter after all.  It’s the alien sound of their communication.  As it grows in volume

The bullet-ridden security guard limps into the Businessman’s room, gray creature with spindly limbs.

The figures slowly close in on the hotel guests

Surveillance cameras black out.

● ● ●

Morning breaks.

The Mother and Daughter sleep soundly as the dog leaps onto the bed and starts licking their faces.  They both stir toward consciousness.  Well-rested.

The food cart sits beside the bed with a half-eaten burger and a few leftover fries.  The television broadcasts a local weather report.

The Daughter turns toward her Mother.  “When did we fall asleep last night?”

The Mother smiles and shrugs.  “We probably needed the rest.”

The Daughter absently rubs a small scar on her abdomen.

Down in the lobby

The Businessman is at the front desk beside them

They pass by the Captain and Flight Attendants.  No one seems to remember or acknowledge each other.  They all wear a similar dull

A family of four walks into the hotel lobby
The children gravitate toward the circus-themed pinball machine in a corner.  They slap the flipper buttons a few times before realizing that the machine is dead.

Legion is a lie, I learned from their failings. The lives of others are a small price to pay for ultimate power and ultimate power is a small price to pay for ending this existence


The man traveled to the place where the other objects were kept. 537 everyday objects that held great power that yearned to be joined again. The object in the man’s hand started to vibrate with energy. He didn’t dare look at it, circa Lovecraft, would be proud of.

The man got closer and closer to the other objects, and smiled to himself. This was it, this was the end. He felt like a god as he stared at those, more or less, mundane items. “No time like the present is there?” The man said before running and jumping into the pile of objects. When he did he felt them pulse with power and a gleeful smile covered his face. At long last, he would bring the end to everything! Not because he hated people or hated himself, he simply had the power to do so. That was reason enough.

Seconds went by, followed everything to the letter. He had obtained all the items in the right order, and ignored all the fakes, how could this happen? Now! After all his work, power was nothing if you didn’t make people suffer!

“Confused are we?” 

The man whipped around

“Who the hell are you kid?” The man asked.

“My name is TK, right Mr. Seeker?” TK asked.

“S…seeker? How do you know that term?” The man asked.

The child smiled again

“How do I know I can trust you?”

“You can’t. I know I wouldn’t if I was a dirt child like yourself, ‘your fate have been sealed!’ Ooga booga booga.” The child said mockingly.

“Brats shouldn’t talk that way to their betters you know.” The man said

“Then why are you?” The child said

“Hey leave those alone! I worked hard for those.”

“Really?” The child said, huh, Mr. Seeker?”

“NOOOO! What have you done! I’ll fucking kill you!” The man yelled running at the kid

“I always wondered about hate. It is an emotion I don’t feel. I don’t act out of malice you know. I simply don’t care. You can relate with that can’t you Mr. Seeker.”

The man groaned as he stared at the child who was walking closer to him

“What did you mean? Why didn’t it work?” The man asked

“Oh

“What? No

“No, what I truly am.”

“And what’s that?”

“The second fist and last.”

“I…I don’t understand.”

“No…you wouldn’t would you? Dirt children are so dumb sometimes.”

The man, so if you are the 539th object, what is the 540th object? If all but one was collected here, where is the last item?”

“Shouldn’t you be wondering where all of the items are at this point?” 

“Just fucking tell me you brat! What is the last object? I’ll start over

The boy smiled a large, Mr. Seeker, I’ll tell you before I send you on your quest. The final object is God.”

“God? As in a bible or something?”

“No. As in the actual creator of you and your pathetic little mud ball of a planet.”

“I…have to find God to bring about the destruction of reality?” The man asked stunned.

“Actually each separate universe has its own set of 538 objects and they are all different. You seekers try to bring them together but it is a fruitless quest because all the objects in the same universe would destroy that reality, like your creator, dirt child, am everywhere. The objects were actually created to try and destroy me, and were made in every single universe in reality, which is actually a first. But I don’t care what happens to you, my creations, your creator, I could destroy all of you.”

The man stared at the boy

“This might be an alien concept to you

“What does that mean?”

The boy just smiled at the man. “Who knows Mr. Seeker. THINK FAST!”

The man’s arms jerked up as the boy tossed an object to him. He looked down at it. It was the last object he had collected. The man felt like he couldn’t breathe. He looked over at the boy who simply smiled at him as the pain grew.
“And now, this is important. You feel this way for everything that was ever lost, and you are going to go find it, Mr. Seeker. But you will feel particularly drawn to the others who have the objects that you spent so much time looking for. You’ll go after them, terrify them, but also entice more to search for the objects, and you

The man

“Don’t worry; I already have someone to spread what I want him to. He’ll do what I ask

The pain overtook the man and he could feel them, but along with them was every single item that had ever been lost, yearning to be found again, by somebody, anybody.

“W-why….TK….?” The man asked pitifully as tears ran down his face.

“Because I’m the Terror King

He turned to leave the apartment. As he stepped through the door, one that spread to every universe he could feel, and he knew who…what it was. It was TK, the Terror King, going back to watch over us as we suffered.

1363145276.0,1a6zu9,Turn That Frown Upside Down (final),Crunkbutter,10,2,3,"Every evening in the cool breeze of twilight

In the dark second-story window of an apartment on my route, I have to say it certainly sends shivers down my spine to look at it. Large human teeth stretched almost halfway across the window-pane. It's an absolutely massive mouth for any person or animal I've ever seen and so I'm sure it's just a toy, but... Who would make a toy that simply frowns all the time? I wonder if that's why the owner has left it facing outside. I can hardly bare to look at it from the street; I couldn't imagine how terrible it looks up close. Why then, would he keep it? A family heirloom? Yes, that must be it. It's nothing more than some old doll passed down through the generations and the owner couldn't bare to part with it.

What is it, I'm sure it will be too dark to get a good look. It's too late to bother the family inside, so perhaps I'll just take a few steps closer to inspect it and be on my way. However, it's the strangest thing... As I get closer, the frown seems to get larger. Not just by reference but it seems to be stretching farther across the window... Could it be alive after all? No, that's silly. It sits so still in the window, surely my mind is just playing the same old tricks

The lamps are being lit one-by-one now. The first illuminates the street just enough so I can still see the grimacing teeth spanning the window. I take a step closer but still, I'll never figure out what it is. I'm becoming so curious, however, that it's almost hypnotizing. The frown gets larger and seemingly more sinister and I swear I can just make out the details on its face. I feel as though I'm just starting to make sense of it, but... Well, now I can't see anything! I look around and my vision is beginning to fade. I'm afraid I'll lose consciousness any second so I try to look for someone to help me but nothing is there except complete and utter darkness! The whole world seems to fade away and just as I'm about to panic, I suddenly feel so sluggish; so... drowsy.

I regain my senses to a terrible headache and blurred vision but slowly, I see what appears to be a man staring at me but it's all upside down. The street, the lamps, the buildings are all upside down! Everything is still too fuzzy make out the face of the man, but staring at each other, he straightens his tie while a smile creeps across his face. He begins to walk away and I try to ask him for help but I can't seem to move a single muscle in my body! I'm forced to wait for what seems like hours, upside down and completely paralyzed until someone finally comes along. I must get his attention, it seems I can only barely move my lips.

Perhaps if I smile at him...",self,t5_2rkx4,1363145518.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1a6zu9/turn_that_frown_upside_down_final/

I'm making this in case something happens to me

I live in a small town called Hollowside. The place is next to (and named after) a large forest, the trees would make a howling sound that could be heard throughout the forest. Those trees were later cut down to clear space for new trees and plants. Some were left for the animals to live in, though.

Now that you have an idea about how the place is, so I might be the only one who heard it. It gave me a fright, and I hurried back inside the house. It was windy that night, so I thought it might have been the hollow trees making noise. The next day I had already forgotten about what I heard that night. I went out as usual and talked to some people, walked my dog and went shopping. I went to buy food first, as I always do. I walked into the store, and greeted the owner's son. He works there sometimes, I walked out and saw a car there. It was the store owner's car. I walked back in and asked the boy where his father was. ''What?'' He said. I repeated the question and he said ''I've never met my father

I went home confused after that exchange, as usual. It was quiet. Instead of taking my usual path around the town, I went for a walk through the forest. It wasn't as dark as one may thing, the moon was shining through the leaves and branches, setting a surreal atmosphere. There were no animal sound, just my footsteps and the panting of my dog. Suddenly I head movement from behind me. I turned around and saw nothing, just a hollow

I was woken up by my dog barking at about 3am. I yelled him to stop, saw that the door was open. I must have left it open after I came home. I ran outside in nothing but my bathrobe and screamed her name. I could still hear her barking in the distance, but saw no trace of her. Then, the wind got stronger. The trees started swaing and howling, and drowned any sound made by me, or my dog. By the time the wind stopped, it was silent. I was scared for her

The next day I woke up to a voice calling my name. I got up and went downstairs. My neighbour was there. ''I came to check on you since your door was open. Are you alright? I thought it might have been a break-in.'' I told him I was fine and asked if he had seen my dog, then I went outside. I decided to go talk to the store owner's son again. What he had said the previous day was really bugging me. Instead of him, there was the owner's wife. I thought nothing of it and asked her where her husband was. ''Are you making fun of me?'' I must have looked very confused because she stopped smiling and said with a puzzled look, ''You know I'm not married. Are you tired or something?'' I thought she was messing with me, that it was a prank of some sort and just laughed it off. After doing my shopping I asked her why she was attending the shop instead of her son. ''Is this another one of your stupid jokes? It's not funny you know.'' For a second I had this stupid grin on my face, but it quickly faded when I saw her serious, almost insulted look.

I asked around and nobody seemed to remember the store owner or his son, something terrible is going on in this town. How can two people be wiped from the history of this town in a matter of days? I'm going to keep looking into this, and I'm keeping this diary to record my process. If this memory loss can happen to anyone, this diary should help me keep track of things if it happens to me.

   Before all this...this crap started, there was a hole in the roof putting a spotlight of this coin. Now if I could go back in time and do things differently, I would. I really fucked up. I grabbed the coin and examined it. It was rusted and had weird etchings in it. I thought it was cool and took it. As soon as I picked it up, the quiet forest roared with birds flying to a new resting place. 


   That night while I was laying down thinking about the coin and where it could have come from. My thoughts were halted by the noises I heard outside. ""They're only animals, but deep down I knew I was wrong. 

   The next day I went back to my place and Chelsey went back to hers. When I got home I couldn't wait to see my best friend waiting for me. But nothing could prepare me for what I was about to see next. I opened the door and right there, told everyone that he died of natural causes. He was old after all.

   After this incident, right? I thought to myself. Man, was I wrong. 

   When I returned home I called Chelsey up and asked if she wanted to come and spend the night at my place after what had happened. She agreed to it. We both had a long day so we quickly crawled into bed and dozed off. 

   Around three in the morning I had woken up to find Chelsey not by my side. I figured she went to the bathroom or something till I heard something unreal
I looked up. I saw my girlfriend in the door way. The most messed up thing was her eyes. My dogs eyes were in place where her eyes should have been.

1360660234.0,18dbbh,A never ending Nightmare,snowstorm56,13,4,3,"This is my first attempt at a creepy pasta

Even now as I type this, twisted, mangled bodies, the evil chasing and the pain and fear of these ""Creepy pasta's"". To this second I still listen to them, watch the videos, read the stories, the joy and fear I feel, but you're probably wondering what I'm talking about

I was searching youtube, this... thing, that showed how sick and twisted the human mind can become. but I digress, I had moved on, for a time life seemed off, as I walked down the street a few days later to hangout with some of my friends It seemed as if my mind was wandering into this dark realm, searching for these signs that I was among the creepy realm of death and gore that these creations inhabited, my friend's Sean and Diego by my side saying I had a seizure and they had found me by the sidewalk, and after a bit of conversation, as per my usual routine and I had received a message from someone named Ben Drowned. I had laughed thinking it was a friend of mine sending me a message

At the start I mostly stuck with the PoKeMoN Pasta's at first. They always interested me

After Installing the rom and playing the full game I went into a state of shock and fear, fighting me, he used curse again and again, but for some reason it had no effect, I had grasped him, which was strange, he was a ghost, but for some reason I was able to grasp him and as I did, and as I was falling I was enveloped in a dark and evil aura. I could sense it's malicious intent and it whispered ""We have you"" and I jumped up from my sleep like you usually do in dreams you have before you hit the ground. I looked over at my computer that had turned on, maybe a little gaming could clear my head. Everything started normally
Needless to say I was stunned. I closed my Minecraft almost instantaneously! I decided that I might just be needing to fill a craving I couldn't understand so I watched some more video's about some creepy pasta's. Mainly I entered Sonic.exe And for once, but seeing him as the blood loving murderer this story made him out to be just filled a need I always seemed to have, seeing my favorite video game character turn into this gore loving animal, started to jolt me into some form of uncontrollable joy. I was like a psychopath! I downloaded the rom and played it, even though in the far reaches of my mind, I seemed to know something was brewing, I was going to end up in the same boat as those who suffered at the hands of this creation of hell. 

After completing the game, I crawled back into bed. I should have went to get some breakfast. My mind wandered yet again, watching Tails and Knuckles get massacred by the hyper sonic speed demon, it was almost too much to bare, what I seemed to enjoy almost disturbingly during my time awake, haunted me almost to the point of madness in my sleep, something had to give and my sanity seemed like the best option. I awoke when the sun was setting, like in my dream. My sense of reality was beginning to crash around me

Months went by, I had dropped out of school, my grades had plummeted,  rendering my life in the foreseeable future possibly doomed, but day after day I searched for creepy pasta's I couldn't stop myself, it was like a drug, driving me on and on to never stop, a never ending drive for some sick, they always checked on me, filled with horror and pain

And that's when I found myself sitting in my room, where I had 3 months of counseling. My mind had all but left me, and what replaced it was something far from the normal human thoughts, but a shell filled with hate and pain, disturbing images and violence, I would lash out at anyone who would try and help me. I didn't need help, I only needed to fill my desire. These stories drove me mad, the gap between awake and sleep was almost seamless in this insane. But this is only the beginning, Is it real? could it be real? Most of us would say no, we know that there are some oddities that just seem to avoid all possible explanations. And this is just the beginning my friends

Oh, the weeds and grass grow but they are spotted black or brown in places. The buildings themselves are an echo to a glory that was not my own. What struck me odd is that there were no road signs, no traffic lights. The paint from the concrete had already *f*aded away. The buildings were not labeled. *I* could only guess that what this area functioned as. The temperature was temperate. The wild was mild. It's like this place was forgotte*n* by humanity. Perhaps it was that this place just... forgot humanity existed. There's not even a broken down car to show that a civilization even existed. I wandere*d* through a slew of buildings that morning. It seemed that I was in some sort of shopping center? There was one building right off that struck *me* as out of place. Hell, it was out of time even.

The building was an odd half-square half-circle totally ma*d*e of stone. Hopping over the counter I entered the workplace are*a*. There was a square like stone... oven of sorts. I'm not sure how else to describe it. Four walls were built up around a pit that was a big in the middle. Dust and ash lay in the bit and o*dd*ly four anvils were nearby. It looked like something out of those “villages trapped in time” sort of deals. Ha

After exploring that building *I* felt like it was time to check out that bar. It was getting late and I *want*ed to see it in the light. The night around here is ominous and very foreboding. From my room I can hear the wind screaming in the nigh*t* down the streets. H*o*wling it is

The place was called “E*l*ysium” and it had no front door. Yep. No front door. The hole in the wall where I could see was apparently the east side of the building

I had to find this sound. It came from the other side of the corner. Well, oh I don't know, three or four feet. I digress. The sound was coming from across the street. The only thing over that way was a very... ver*y* large ruined building. The front of the ruins held a door that had rotted *o*ff it's hinges. There cracks in the walls parts fallen in j*u*st like any where else but the glass here was a bit stronger. It was thick stained glass the color of deep azure.

Stepping over the broken and dusty wood I was reminded of an old cathedral, onyx and some other stones that I couldn't make out doted the place. Although the center of the floor stood a very large black marble table, sturdy. There were multiple chairs crushed and broken around it save three. All near the head of the table. I could hear the sounds, like music from a lost dream or memory, getting louder. I followed it slowly and it led me through the rubble, which of course held nothing of a location or a name, to a mahogany door with one of those brass ball handles has a push button lock on the other side... and it was unlocked.

The door lead to an immediate drop into that same black marble that the table was made of. The music was stronger than ever before. I felt a sense of something like pride when I heard it a proud fatherly feel. One that you get when you are watching your young girl sleep in her room through the camera in a home video. The stairs were steep but long and black. It went down forever it seemed. The light from the door above was just a pinprick of light but as I got closer the I could see the phosphorescent purple-green light from below.

I reached the bottom of the stairs and the light turned out to be mushrooms. Yep. Mushrooms. At least all life here wasn't dead or dieing. Glancing around the room to see what little I could I saw that they covered every inch of wall and ceiling space. Purple-green was dominant here but the further this, there was one though that stood erect on left, near where a worked-stoned hall came from.

Stepping down into the room the ground was firm but there was loose dirt here and there. I cautiously moved up to the casket glancing inside. Why did I see? What else? A skeleton … with a giant sword. One of those huge ones like at a renaissance fair. It too glistened with water that trailed down it's blade and oddly it wasn't rusted at all. Good work that.

The music was getting louder

A man easily as tall as me, anyway, the sound came from there. It was biting into another man with the same head of a dog that was crucified and hung from the wall. I stood there paralyzed at the site. The creature bit into the inside thigh of the other, breaking the bone and then ripped the flesh off and ate it! I couldn't take it. I ran down the hall a ways and vomited up every bit of what I had inside me twice, it felt like. Steadying myself and wanting to get away from that and closer to this damnable fairy music I started again down the hall. A myriad of sights awaited me. There were more of those dog-man creatures these though had their chests and ribs broken open. Their insides removed and what I found fucked up about it all was that there was a heart drawn on the ceiling of one of the rooms.

After a few broken down halls of this nightmare I found a stone door with another turn-style handle. It opened easily enough and I stepped through. This is what I was looking for. The music box! It was mahogany wood and still playing it's siren like call to me. I approached it of course and I felt from it was .. pride, I felt dizzy and disoriented. Everything seemed to have paused for lack of a better word and yes, I felt like I could reach out and touch her again. She was so beautiful, so loving and so kind. She and her two friends were always over playing games with each other. It was wonderful.

I looked around the room again. I was in a child's bedroom.... or a midget's love shack one of the two. Against the left wall, how do I know? Does it matter... really? The bed was big enough for me to lay in, not that I did or anything. There was a vanity with a mirror a small little top area to put stuff on and drawers. Moving from one to the other I hit my foot on a length of chain. It was a manacle attached to the leg of the bed. “No worse than anything else I've seen,” I thought to myself.

""He says he wants to be called Sweetie because he needs people to know that he means no harm.""

""No harm?!"" I asked

Now, frightened ten year old. I'd believe in almost anything you told me. So I believed on Lucy's story right away.

""He doesn't want to be seen as a freak. He says that all he wants is to be understood."" she went on

""He did something horrible

""He just does."" and she left. I was worried that I had hurt her feelings

I was about to leave the room when I noticed something on the foot of Lucy's bed. It was a piece of paper that seemed like someone had torn out from a notebook. There was writing on it. For all I remember

*Sweetie came in to see me again. This time

It was a journal entry on the day we went out on the woods. I didn't even know Lucy had a diary. I looked around. No one was watching. I slowly peered under the bed and looked for more. Success. It was one from the week before.

*He used to scare me, his cheeks almost touch his eyes. He's all gray, too.*

I shivered. Uncertain of everything, and I was about to give up and forget about her story, and admit that she was just making it up, until I tripped over something and fell down.

On further inspections, so I felt like I was inside a case. 

On most of the pages it talked about what Lucy had done during the day at school

*I saw that thing on my window tonight. I don't know what it is

I carefully tore the paper out and put it in my pocket. It just looked like I'd need it later. When I heard someone coming

I spent hours linking the events. The noise we heard at the woods and the marks on the tree were definitely made by Sweetie. But why was Amy laughing? Did she have any knowledge about him? I couldn't wait any longer. I had to do my research.

I was about to head out to the library and find out some more about that so called ""Sweetie""

When I picked it up

There was static sound. I wanted to hang up, dark but whispery voice said: 

""I hope you remember me.""

Then they hung up.

At first

I tried to look up the number

Even though I felt a deep frightening sensation

I asked the kind lady that happened to live a few blocks away from me if she had any books about legends, until I decided to show her Lucy's painting of Sweetie. She stared at it for a couple of seconds, then she became a little bit pale. I asked if she was alright, but she said nothing. All she did was point to a certain section. ""There's something she's not telling me"" I thought. I decided to follow her directions and found an old shelf, filled with old books. I took a small peek at each one, but found nothing of interest. When I was about to give up, I saw a small, I took it out of the shelf. After I saw what was drawn on the front of it

It was a nearly identical drawing of Sweetie to the one Lucy had drawn. I opened it

*Once you see Sweetie

*Murder you* It went back and forth across my head. Sweetie had obviously made it clear that he (or should I say ""it""? Let's go by ""he"") had followed me home and scratched on my window. And Lucy was lying about her naming him. He told/manipulated her into calling him that. And now he'd yank MY eyes out. My whole body shook with fear

As I exited the big library

""Be careful with what you get involved into.""

I knew exactly what she meant.

I entered my house

""Dear

There were some pictures of me and Paul as toddlers, etc. But there was something unsettling about the pictures.

""Mom

""That might have been your dad

But as I looked at some other pictures, I felt my heart skip a beat.

Right behind that Christmas tree, oval eyes, his bright hellish smile and his long, pointy claws that hung from his paws.

“But this isn’t right


My memories come and go. I remember when I was alive. I had a family at one time


This is a strange place I find myself in. While I have memories of my own death


Sometimes the only memories that come to me are bad things I have done. When this happens I think that I must be in hell and this is my penance for what I have done. This can go on for weeks or even months.


This is my own hell.


But then one day something happened. The darkness I lived in was suddenly destroyed by a powerful light. I was blinded by its brilliance. I see a figure blacked out by the light. I think that perhaps my time in this hell is over. Perhaps it is time for me to be reunited with my family after such a long time of being alone.


The image of a person dissolves and soon becomes a demon bathed in fire. 


I hear a voice. But I cannot understand the words.


Then


 I feel pain shoot through me as if I have suddenly been stabbed…memories from my life come flooding back. I remember by death again. Trying to protect the ones I loved

Why God? Why am I in this place if my last act on Earth was to protect my family?


The demon roars with pain and rage as my wish to see it harmed comes true.


My plan does not work though. The demon unleashes a powerful blow on me. My physical body can feel itself getting weaker. My last act of defiance is to link my own soul with that of the demon. I I am to be destroyed


But my plan fails. I am again imprisoned, something worse. 


Now my world is that of twilight. I do not feel the pain caused by the demon. Burned and beaten as I am


Time passes


Then one day I discovered something. I could remake any place with my mind.


I think of my home


I like it here; perhaps I can now find peace at last.


Then I discovered the sad truth. My family, at least not a bright and peaceful one. This is a lie.


I banish it and once again I am in twilight, it seems like no time at all for me.


Then I hear it. A called name. A name that sounds familiar although it is not my own…I am thrust back into the real world again.


I stare into the face of another demon


Another voice commands me and I am propelled to listen to it. I unleash a powerful attack on this new demon. It seems I can create balls of energy. I do not know when I learned to do this


Soon the other demon is defeated and I am dragged back into my prison to await the time I am forced to fight for something that now controls me and I am powerless to defend against it or to stop it. I must go on fighting and fighting. I do grow stronger


This is my hell.

Journal Entry: Today while exploring the catacombs in Relic Castle I found a Confagrigus. Using my Emboar I was able to weaken the Pokémon so I could catch it. After I healed the Confagrigus at a Pokémon Center I used it to beat a trainer who was using a Hypno. I hope my new Confagrigus and I will become the best of friends now, does. Oh well, if that myth is true then it must be great being a Pokémon and battling other Pokémon to become stronger. I hope I get the chance to become a Confagrigus too one day and grow stronger with a power trainer.

1342016717.0,wdwb5,Meow..,Chadgunz,16,9,9,"The following is a true story

Someone once told me that there are things that live in the woods our city
was built upon. They said that creatures have been lurking within the damp
gloom and cool shade of the trees long before we arrived here. I myself have
heard about strange things that have happened just outside of the major
cities that were
with my own eyes a glimpse of what lies beyond civilization. 


I am from a small community outside of Edwardsville
Shores. It is a subdivision built in the middle of nowhere nestled amongst
many fields of corn. The whole community is not quite large enough to be
called a town
boating and water skiing. All of the roads are named after some sort of
ocean theme like Sexton
super safe rural places where people don't usually lock their doors
everyone knows everybody. It was a great place to grow up except the ride to
school was almost 45 minutes
heart of Edwardsville or in Glen Carbon another neighboring city. 


These are
Southern Illinois towns all very quaint and pristine. 
My parents' house was of on a sort of big hill in the middle of the
neighborhood. At that time in people had some space between themselves and
their fellow neighbor. There was a lot of open land and empty spaces for
things to hide. Towards the side of my parents' house was a big slope with a
patch of trees and weeds that grew along the side of the road. It was my
13th or 14th birthday and they had bought me a bike
probably a size or two too small so I could do stunts. My friend Kyle was
over with his bike
roads on our bikes trying to ride wheelies
remember much of the day and the whole situation to me now seems like some
sort of surreal nightmare. Kyle was at the top of the big slope which was my
families driveway
turn my bike around and head back towards the driveway. The street lights
had just come on
coming night. 


As I was heading back I heard a cat meowing in the patch of trees along the
side of the road by my house. Being a curious kid and an animal lover
hopped off my bike and went to investigate the noise. What I saw it seems my
mind to this day refuses to accept
just thinking about its haunting form. The meowing had come from what
appeared to be a pale white manlike thing. It was completely naked
hunched over in the thick of the trees. What I can remember most was the
things back bones jutting from its impossibly white skin. From my
perspective it was hunched forward and crouched over something
back towards me. The mind never stops trying to categorize and make sense of
things the best it can. I think we are in a constant attempt to reason with
what is presented to us in life. What I saw that day made no sense
of no category of creature known to man. My mind has supplemented its face
with a hodgepodge of horror
am now 25 and to this day
put back the pieces of this fading phantasm.


The thing wretched it's morbid head my direction
emitted a second feline meow through a row of small sharp animal teeth.
There was this moment where our eyes made contact
with mine in a predatory stare. I don't know what expression was in that
cold reptilian like face and I had no intention of examining it further.
Immediately I collected myself
hopped on my bike and tore back around to the front of my house like a bat
out of hell. Kyle was still at the top of the driveway and he could tell
something wasn't right. Huffing
thicket of trees. I told him to go see it for himself
went around the corner and brought his bike to a stop. He probably heard it
call to him as well with its libelous cry. He didn't get off of his bike
but turned around quickly and rushed back in the same manner as I. He saw it

Do so without reading any other paragraphs and do it now. Please…trust me.

What happens next is entirely your fault. You failed the test and now you’re in danger. I didn’t write this.

They made me write it. It’s my fingers on the keyboard, do not look away from these words. Keep reading until I tell you otherwise. And when I tell you otherwise, do exactly as I say. For if you do not read this exactly how I tell you to, you will die.

Listen carefully. First, casting your eyes down to the paragraph that follows it. Promise me, for the sake of those you hold dear. This is your only chance to redeem yourself for not trusting me earlier. Skip the paragraph following this one, and do so now.

The Forbidden Paragraph: You had to do it, you will stay alive only as long as you can stay awake. The next time you fall asleep will be your last. They’re watching you. They’re listening to your thoughts. They’ll wait for you. And when you fall asleep, they’ll come for you. You should have trusted me.

If you skipped the paragraph above, they’ll come for you. To stay alive, you must draw blood from someone you love. A drop, that’s all, and place it on your tongue. That’s what they want. That’s what they need. They’re inside you right now. And they’re waiting. If between waking up and falling asleep you fail to deliver the blood of a loved one, you will never wake up again.

1326343385.0,odhl6,Hell's Pasture (first AND ONLY creepypasta I wrote),Injustice-Shall-Fall,10,0,3,"Since I was a young boy, you were in a small community. I loved the idea. So

Lo and behold, as it was, was just enough. My only real complaint was that the game appeared to have been opened slightly, but my dream would somewhat come true. I had my farm in my hands.

Eager to start, I chose the name 'North Farm'. I chose the pointy-eared dog and named him 'Kitsune', thinking A) that he resembled a fox, and B) that it could be affectionately shortened to 'Kit'. Hating my own name, I chose to enter 'Damion' as my own name. I started off with some seeds and a cow, and a few tools, and dived right into the game.

I took great care of my animals as the farm grew, real-life pets. I'd place orders for food and tools, and spend whatever time away from the farm either fishing, helping out with the fossil dig, or attempting to woo Celia (I was successful and eventually married). Eventually I would go on automatic, placing the orders and forgetting about them.

So, I took her in happily, wondering if maybe she was a gift or a glitch, or, perhaps just another order I forgot I had made. I gave her the name 'MuuMuu', and treated her no different than the other animals that I had at the time, and she eventually paid for herself. I was recieving the highest quality Star Milk and it sold for a small fortune.

Eventually though, shutting off the Cube and instead putting in hours on a new XBox 360. The GameCube went unforgotten, collecting dust for years.

Eventually, I cleaned off the console as best I could and popped that sucker in.

A warning light went off in my head when the title screen appeared. It was the same Forget-Me-Not Village, and 'clicked' every now and again. I thought nothing of it, perhaps it was just my imagination. I pressed start and loaded my old file. Everything seemed as I had left it all those years ago: North Farm, Kitsune, Damion. I played as if nothing was wrong, putting feed in the boxes and doing whatever needed to be done.

The second warning light came on when I ventured through the town. It seemed less... lively than it used to. It wasn't til after I had played for a while that I realized that it seemed less lively, gave no sound. All that read was '...', but nothing else. No hint, no clue, nothing.

I returned to my farm. Why had all this change come about? I checked my chicken coop, but I'll never rid the image from my mind: There was blood on the walls, and feathers strewn about. My crops were all dead. I checked my house: My family was not there. In the stable and pasture, there were no animals, save for my horse, my dog, and my cow MuuMuu.

I didn't get it. What had happened? I paused the game and checked GameFAQs

""Welcome back, barking in my defense.

MuuMuu slowly walked to me. ""Do you like what I've done with the place while you were gone?"" In my horror, leaving behind my dog. I could hear the sound of a dog whimpering, bone and marrow crunching, and a swallowing noise followed by a happy Cow noise.

I had no idea where to go. The hotel? Too close. The dig site? I'd be cornered. I thought quickly... where could I go that this beast wouldn't find me? I made a beeline for the Twins' house. Cows couldn't climb ladders. Unfourtunately

I could hear the sound of an angry horse and an angry cow fighting, horrid noise. The screen went dark. Then, another text box popped up.

""Milk me. Yes/No""

Confused by this

I checked the milk I had recieved and was shocked at what I had done. In my inventory were five 'Blood Milk'. The description read

""I came to you because nobody wanted me. You cared for your animals. I wanted to be loved and cared

My eyes were misting now, power, I opened the cover. Nothing happened, and the scene kept going. ""You abandonned us... why did you do it? Were we not good enough for you?"" My heart sank.

""No

""You abandonned us... YOU ABANDONED ME!"" MuuMuu's eyes glowed a demonic red, mournful sound emitted the TV's speakers, a sound that Hell itself could not replicate. MuuMuu's mouth opened up, revealing all she had devoured: Her teeth soaked in blood, feathers sticking to them. Cow guts and internal workings over her tongue, and her most recent victims: My dog's head inpaled on her tooth, and my horse with a section of stomach missing

""I'M... STILL... HUNNNNGRRRRRYYYYYY!"" She roared. I gasped as control was handed to me for a breif moment, when it said 'Use'. What happened next was a cinematic that I wasn't entirely surprised about. Damion raised the sickle and, shedding a tear, sliced at MuuMuu, slitting her throat and killing her.

I took a moment to gather myself

""We all hid here, and all was well. I sighed with relief, releasing the breath I had been holding and chuckling dumbly to myself. It was over.

Or so I thought. The game froze

GAME OVER
IN MEMORIAM

I watched hopelessly as the names of my animals and some townsfolk came on this screen of this victim list. After the last name,

GAME OVER.

Underneath was a picture of Damion, a foot missing, bone and sinew all over. There was a hole where his heart should have been, and organs were leaking out of a hole in his stomach. I felt I was going to be sick, then the screen began flashing and I seized.

I woke up in my mother's arms

The words are still scarred on my body. Since then I have not touched a glass of milk, gone. I wrote this to let you know that nostalgia should be just a memory, but if you must, please, PLEASE, for the love of God and all that is holy and sacred, ERASE ALL YOUR DATA before starting up again,,False,t3_odhl6

An AnecdoteEdit

Loved this show. Horace Horrible was my favorite. I remember looking everywhere for his action figure but Kiddie City and KB had never even heard of the line. I finally found a talking Horace, though I didn’t see a house around and never saw those people again. I was pretty excited, and ran right to my friend’s house to gloat.

When his mom answered the door, and that it must have been an even more serious crime than I thought.

So, but his voice chip was pretty damn loud, and every so often he’d go off by himself, like his battery was dying. My mom kept asking if Marble (our cat) was in my room…I don’t know how you mistake that goofy chuckling for a cat.

It was subtle at first, so I did what a rational child does when he thinks he has contraband and buried it in the woods.

I never found another one or figured out what was wrong with him, in just a couple weeks. It never grew leaves and it never got much taller than me, but it’s there to this day, and every summer it swarms with disturbing numbers of flies, wasps and ants. ",,False,t5_2rkx4,True

It was really an easy life (or at least it could have been a lot worse), Mom took care of the animals, then we all had dinner together every night, and I would go to bed while Mom and Dad had a beer or two and watched the news. Sometimes at night I would hear things outside. Mostly just normal stuff. The cows or horses would get spooked by a coyote or something, or I would hear the dogs chasing a rabbit, barking their heads off. Every once in a great while we would find a chicken dead. Dad would always tell me about it but never let me see the body, although I asked frequently. He would keep Mom and I inside until he had gone out, throw sawdust over any blood


The summer when I was ten years old, you don’t want to, trust me. It sounds almost like a person screaming. Well that’s what we heard, and one of our horses, the palamino, came running into the barn with a wound on it’s left thigh. Four long marks, like claw marks, and was limping. I was so scared by the sight of that much blood that Mom locked the horse in a stall and made me go inside with one of the dogs. She told me to lock the door and stay inside until she came in to get me. I did.

Came prancing through the empty field  
And screamed as I pursued.
    

One, two!  
And through and through  
My vorpal blade went snicker-snack!  
I left her dead and took her head  
And stuffed it in my sack.
    

Now I had slain the Jabberwock  
And so my prowess all would see.  
""O frabjous day! Caloo

Did gyre and gimble in the wabe.

And the mome raths outgrabe.

After a few stories of a faceless woman

We got back in the car, we had took many as to get the perfect quality, and I was curious to how the camera had captured it, on all but one of the photos though, there was this odd humanoid figure popping out from the lake, the camera has a pretty bad night feature, but you can clearly see this in the photos displayed with this text. The figure appears to have a lamb skull, with no eyes.

As soon as I see this

One night, It was near the time he had to go to sleep, so his sister sent him to bed and then she began watching the television.

“I was just about sleeping” he said to me. “But then...” He explained to me that an entity appeared above him, the void in his eyes. He then fainted. The morning after, his sister was nowhere to be found. The parents searched everywhere for her. They called the police, but after 2 weeks of searching for her, they proclaimed her dead.


“How could I forget about that!” He exclaimed. then he started crying. his words were mangled.
I tried comforting him “You were 4 years old, knowing fully well about his sister. She often babysat me, our families where friends and she was always so sweet. I had a crush on her myself, but at that age, I was only dreaming and I was a kid being a kid.


We both climb into his truck again, promising him I would talk to him on skype video chat, and play league of legends with him to make the night go by faster.


We had played a couple of games, brutally loud too. I quickly threw them off of my head as I watched in terror. on my monitor I could see the Goat man holding Franks head. I saw my friends eyes turn black, the same kind of black that where on the face of the being I now call “Goatman”. The Goatman had disappeared, and Frank fell to the floor. I waited for a moment, then I quickly grabbed my keys and drove down to his place. I knocked furiously on his door, No answer. I climbed into his house from a window. I screamed his name in fear. Still no sign of him.


I made my way to his room. The door was locked, when suddenly, I feel remarkable pain in my abdomen. I look down and to my surprise I see a knife peering out of my chest. I fell to the floor. I gasped for air and I turned to see Frank. But it wasn’t him anymore, It was only his body, and shell from who he was before. I was crying. I did not want to die. The only thing he said was “We all want to do these things, I am the being who makes you do the things we all desire” As he was about to impale me one last time. The police shot him 4 times in the chest. and he fell over.


I was taken into the emergency room. Luckily I only suffered from paralyzation from the lower portion of my body. But, run as far as you can. The Goatman has no mercy. Here is a picture of him: http://25.media.tumblr.com/354d47c4736c8a0072478b993a7853e2/tumblr_mpjxkjVfPt1rci6iyo1_500.jpg

With your bags packed, and upon closer inspection novelty fuzzy dice will hang in the mirror. Although you will suddenly realize that cabs like these are extremely hard to find, do not give any thought to it. At this point you MUST point out in front of the car and say “Yo homes to Bel Air!” You will stop in front of a mansion, and it will be sometime between 7 and 6 o'clock, even though it will feel like you've been traveling mere seconds. Get your luggage out and say ""Yo homes, smell ya later,” but do NOT turn back to face the cabby. Walk up to the door, and then knock on the door three times.

Signore Gepetto’s Insanity

  All I had wanted….was a son. Yes dear reader, a boy of wood who learns the importance of humility – but I don’t think you know why or how it came to fruition and what the real reality of it is or was.
    It had begun simply enough on the dingy streets I had grown used to in my old age –  with all its violence, I had not come from the most affluent family – so I couldn’t have cared less about the world around me, especially in Sicily. My wife, her life as a destitute woman with a penchant for gluttony finally catching up with her, died three months before my first encounter with La mafia siciliana2, who would eventually run my life until those cold, cruel days inside the belly of that  blasted whale. Her name was Isabella
    
   When I began my life as a degenerate carpenter, but I’m afraid it was the isolation. In this isolation, my tools had taken on their own personalities with each passing day, as I fell further into this lurid insanity. One tool, I had taken a particular interest in. My hammer, I had called her Helena in my insanity, and as time wore on – she became my second wife, you may know her as a male cricket known as “Conscience.” Pinocchio, love me...” it murmured with the slightest hint of insidious intent. As I reviled away from my tools and looked accusingly at my Helena,” with a stinging smirk that could be felt even without the assistance a face gives. Still
When I awoke, sent chills down my spine. Truly, I’d gone mad because as I lifted my head; realizing the absurdity of the situation – my taking to conversing with what are assumed to be inanimate objects –I steadfastly realized that there was no life in my marionette at all. Rather, it was a crazed lunatic who’d found his way into my house. Obviously, it was one of Mastreo Bombino’s men – come to mock me once again whilst simultaneously asking for protection money. 

His short, a crazy old man’s illegitimate son died of polio,” he began, as if speaking to a group of children – and not to an introverted old man, wincing in anticipation of pain – breathing in deeply and taking a swing with the mahogany bat with the inscription “Pleasure Island Amusements” embroidered upon it, he continued, “which is all fine and sad – but soon the old man forgot to pay his tribute to Signore Bombino. And we all know how that ends, creating what I assume was a drug-induced manifestation of children. Slowly he began taking another swing with his bat,000 lire4?” Obviously I couldn’t answer as the air was stricken from my lungs as I attempted to speak. “Huh? What was that? I can’t here you over the sound of your dead son.  Maybe he shouldn’t have gone to that carnival, I thought to myself. He was mightier
I had lost another child, and now it had taken my child again. Polio can be cured, but my selfish deeds of the past had taken poor Paris from my grasp – and now, as I write this last memoir to my horrid life on this island of regret and despair, I wish only that I could have told at least half as much truth as I did. Now you know why Pinocchio never really became a real boy. I was never a real boy; I was a shell of a human being – and eventually that deceit spread like polio, infecting me entire being, forcing me to pen that storied fairy tale. It pains me even now, “Reality is stranger than fiction.”

Is it the shadows that seem to take shape or the uncertainty of whether or not you are safe? It is a combination. The feeling of not knowing what is there is what makes you feel unsafe.

Because in a way they are all based on us. Every monster or murderer was scene at some point by someone or how else would they think to give us shape? Because at some point that person saw us or heard us. At some point they saw the shadow moving and changing. At some point they saw the glint of Jason Voorhees machete in their closet. At some point they heard Freddy Krueger's blades clicking and sliding against the glass of their window.
I can see you trembling now wondering whether that shape is just a stack of clothes or something more sinister. Maybe you can't even see us but I know you feel us.

These are events which happened in my life


My name is Justin, oddly enough. 
I could go on and on

Here's the deal: I'm into mysticism. Heavily. At that point and time I didn't really understand magick (yes, tarot reading after tarot reading without even referencing a single book. I created talismans and the such in hopes that I could one day get all the material wealth I could ever want.

That was my first weakness: attachment to the physical world; I loved money
I guess you could say I loved it because I rarely got any at all
I mean, and for *free*.


Yeah, nor do I today; but today is not the past.

You see
The problems escalated as life went on, and my teachers would grade my papers differently than all the other students, apparently as a joke from what I heard after I graduated. Needless to say, my years coming up were not easy compared to everyone else.

People had friends, only because my parents made me. So it was extremely hard to cope with the fact of how alone I felt. 

The frustration built and built. 
Year after year everything proceeded to get worse and worse. Still no one paid attention to me nor asked how I was doing. I was continuously bullied and made fun of

It was then
She showed me this thing called ""magick"". Something I never really believed in.
Not only that
She told me I was powerful. Something I never really believed before


Though

Magick is all about intent, should be cast with the right intent. Your Will drives all, and that's what I didn't understand. It's essentially the same thing as saying, ""I know I can, I know I can, I know I can"" over and over again until you've convinced yourself that you can do it.





Dread. That's the best way to describe what I felt every night when I went to bed. Hate. Anger. Betrayal.

All of those things
Little did I know

Figures began manifesting themselves in front of my eyes. A man with dark eyes who screamed at me. 
Screaming. That's what I felt from wake to sleep. Every day of the week. 

Screaming.

I became so angry
When I exploded

And in that heat of anger
Pain. From wake to sleep. It was all that encompassed my mind from wake to sleep. Each day of the week. 

I didn't know how to take it, so upset, so frustrated.

Everything spell I cast didn't work and only made everything worse. Every person I met always forgot about me. I felt so hurt
My rage become a ""life force"". It was the reason I was alive

I remember attempting suicide and my mother crying after she found me. She cared. But it wasn't enough.

No one else cared about me

I asked to be invited to things


I begged. They didn't respond. I was shooed away.
My rage reached its limit

I later went insane

Alone. 
Christ Jesus

I remember one day when I was walking up the stairs I turned around and saw a black mass staring back at me. It then phased through the wall and left me alone.
For the first time in the while I felt that something actually cared about me

Everything continued to get worse and I progressively got more hostile. 
Eventually I was excluded from even family events. And that was it

Everything was horrible
I banished it

Free. 
I love that word

Nowadays

I was about thirty minutes in, you could see how obvious and fake the costumes/props were, plastic monsters relying on mechanics to engineer their movement.

My ears began ringing, I was scared. I swear to god, I heard something scurrying across my kitchen floor, along with a light panting sound.

My eyes refocused on the TV which now was showing the film, pointed ears, a long, skinny nose, and very little yet vicious looking teeth. It was chasing the actors through the house, although unlike the other monsters and props, this one looked more modern, more realistic than the other costumes/props.

The ringing in my ears returned. I felt dizzy, along with a tapping on the window in the living room. I heard someone walking up and down the stairs, in a never ending loop. I looked to the window after a long period of hesitation, and I saw hand, jet black skin, and unnaturally long finger nails tapping it. When I say hand, I mean a hand, just the hand and fingers.

The darkness suffocated him and only amplified his fear of his unknown surroundings. Every time he tried to focus his eyes they became blurry and the throbbing in his head grew stronger. The wall behind him was a comfort only for its reassurance that there was something there. The vague thought of what else was in the room planted a seed of both hope and fear.

He had no recollection of coming to this room or what he had been doing before. His own name was covered by a haze in his head. He tried to think

He awoke a second time. His head felt slightly better, I just need to get out. Remembering that trying to stand up threw him back into unconsciousness, he attempted a different approach. He pushed with one hand and rolled to the side. The grey came back for him, but he held it off and managed to stay conscious. Slowly, he pushed himself up on his hands and knees, fighting the grey the whole time. 

Once upright he settled on his legs and sat for a moment gaining his strength. The air around him was still and cold. For the first time he noticed how quiet it was; nothing but the sound of his own labored breathing could be heard. He strained himself trying to hear something, but now it was beginning to grow stronger, growing from a quiet drip to a more noticeable dribble. 

Reaching his hand to his left he felt the wall. Slowly, felt the wall, moved a few inches… He crawled onward, exploring the dark hell around him. The cold floor made his already sore legs hurt more, but he did not notice; the adrenaline of pain and fear had dulled him to such feelings. All that mattered now was touching the wall, moving, touching the wall, hitting a wall in front of him.
 
He stopped. Felling with his hand he traced the line between the wall he had been following and the new wall directly in front of him. He sat again, and with a door… Freedom. 

Freedom gave him the boost he needed and he crawled forward along the new wall. Move, touch the wall, move, moan. He froze instantly. No sound had come from him, he was sure of it. I did not do that. The hair slowly rose on the nape of his neck and his whole body went cold. Where ever he was, he was not alone.

He stayed in the same frozen position he knew not how long. One minute. Five minutes. An hour. Days. It all felt the same: timeless and unrelenting in terror. Slowly, a steady stream, then back to a slow, quiet drip.

With his confidence back he set out along the wall again. Move, touch, move, touch, wall. He hit a third wall. This new wall felt the same as the first two, cold, hard, scaring himself at the sudden noise. The perpetual silence was beginning to wear on his mind. Perhaps it’s better than hearing something…

His confidence was returning having discovered the third wall. From his exploration he figured the room to be twenty feet wide. Not that it mattered. All that worried him was getting out. The darkness, but for now, he was still in control.
Wall number three. He began shuffling along the side as he had before. Please let there be a door here. His head connected with something in front of him. It wasn’t another wall, he felt a soft, sticky material between the metal and the wall. The feeling was of cloth splattered with a thick liquid. 

He kept exploring with his hand, why it could be on the wall, how well it was secured to the wall-
He froze. Silence. A soft rustle, musty air felt deprived of all oxygen, like he was trapped in a vacuum. The gray began to creep towards the center of his vision. Forcing himself to take a breath he did so as quietly as possible. 

His mind was blank. The absolute horror had numbed every sense in his body. Slowly, he began to react. I’m not alone. The thought that another person was in here was comforting, but the thought that it wasn’t a person jumped into his head just as fast. Don’t be ridiculous. No matter how terrified you may be you must think rationally. The thought lingered. I could move away then call to them. They seem secured and I’d be safe then. 

Trying to think rationally harder than ever, but a few tacky spots remained. A new smell entered his nostrils; copper. He reached up and touched his extremely sore nose again and found the same mess on his face. 

I’m not the first one that’s been in here. He stopped and slowly, something powerful, something heavy moving from across the room. The eyes moved with it. The eyes grew larger, grew closer. He could not do anything; only stare into the eyes of his friend as the grey began to close on him for a final time.

Channel 636

(suggested song to be played in the background: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH-AU9ykCbY) 

I just want to start off by saying
It was Friday morning, and I decided to switch on the television since there wasn’t really much to do. I was alone in the office and it was impossible to see what was going on outside, it was pitch black. Alongside all the office lights but the room I was in being off, It was a slightly creepy atmosphere. A chill ran down my neck, the hairs on my arms stood on end, I can’t quite explain how it felt but it was certainly strange. I shook that aside and flicked through the channels, rubbish, MTV, I often wondered about why on earth someone would choose to build an office on the border between the city and the forest. I noticed a tall dark figure in the far distance
“I must be seeing things” I muttered aloud
I walked back to the television and flicked through. It was all the typical late night crap, obviously aimed at children. There was a rabbit running around with a cat in what seemed to be a school, It was all normal. That was until the rabbit fell over. He lay on the floor, the scene just froze there. I noticed that his eyes seemed to be more realistic, they were glazed and human like. Then the rabbit sat up, and started crying, but it sounded real. Like someone recorded a child crying and just used that as audio, the rabbit was home and was sitting on his bed, It wasn’t the comical funny booing you usually hear in cartoon

At this point I found myself quite creeped out, I scanned my eyes around the forest, trying to make out what I could from the pitch black. It didn’t seem like there was anyone there, how strange. I walked back to the television, I unpaused it and it continued almost immediately onto another scene, this time the rabbit was playing a saxophone in a room by himself. Suddenly I heard a crash behind me, I paused the television quickly and went to see what it was. I walked towards where I heard the crash come from, someone had thrown something at it or tried to get in. I reached for my phone to call the police to check around the area
“Bloody thing
I went to use the office phone but that too wasn’t working, but I came back to something that completely shocked me. It was a picture of a child. Dead and naked, their body on a pavement with their head cut off completely. It was so bloody and gruesome. My first thought was that this must have been some sort of sick joke someone did, but where would they get a photo like that in the first place? It didn’t have any dates or stamps on it so it couldn’t be police evidence, you could see the shadow of the photographer in the picture. Moreover the photo was done at an angle, it was almost as if the photographer had positioned the body for the picture. Was the photographer the killer? It was sickening so I unpaused it and carried on watching, I wondered if there were anymore hidden pictures like this in the cartoon. 
The rabbit then stared at the viewer again
“He’s coming” the rabbit said, even by studio standards. It was almost as if he was there with me, but who was ‘he’ that the rabbit was talking about? Perhaps the cat or another animal? 
He continued to repeat himself for about 10 minutes, this can’t have been for children, the blood splattered all over the screen, It was so real and flowed and dripped like real blood. I reached out and touched the screen and to my horror, there was blood on my fingers. I fell to the floor and started shaking, this was ridiculous. 
I heard the crying again, it was at the end of the office, towards where the cracked window was. And lying there was a rabbit, it’s head dismembered and its organs pouring out of its stomach, the carpet it was on was a deep shade of crimson and the window was smashed completely. I picked up the rabbit in my hands and noticed that it had a mark on it, it seemed as if it was burnt on by some sort of branding iron. It was a circle with a triangle within it and within the space there were complex patterns and tiny pictures that I couldn’t make out. I put it down and looked around, where on earth could the scream have come from...
“Hello?” I called out
There was an eerie silence, or something was in the building with me. I turned to the broken window and realised that the dead rabbit was gone, the blood stain and the organs were still there, but there was no trace of the body.
“Hello?” I shouted again
I took out my flashlight and cautiously walked outside;
“Anyone there?” I called as I looked around, and my mind went back to earlier when I saw the tall figure, he might be behind this all, but who was he, some sort of pranker. I hoped. 
Suddenly I felt a grip on my throat, he was bald with no facial features save an ugly scar that ran where his mouth should be. It twisted into what seemed to be a smile, and I blacked out.

I woke up in the middle of the woods, each step causing me more pain until I reached a road, to my luck there was a police car passing by and they took me to the hospital. They couldn’t explain what was wrong with me, my leg had turned dark black but was still fully functional and had nothing wrong with it. They eventually let me out and I went home, as I opened my front door I was hit with a strong smell, I looked around and I couldn't find the source. Until I went to my room. There above my bed was a rabbit pinned to the wall with its organs on my pillow, the circle with the triangle sign smeared everywhere on my walls.

I quit my job and moved out of that town, but I’m scared.

They have tendrils of darkness drifting around their body like black flames, making their exact shape rather... imprecise.

Either way

I haven't had the chance to take pictures yet


NEWTON -- Moved here about a year ago from CA. Nice little town with predominantly Italian community. My only sighting here was at a local playground at dusk.

I often took to taking a few beers to the local park (it was pretty much never used except by teenagers with cheap takout or illicit alcohol. Like me). I'd swing on the swings, just a way to get out of the house and away from my computer. I'd done it a number of times before, but never again after the sighting. At first I thought I was just drunkenly paranoid, because I thought I heard someone crooning along to my rendition of Ingrid Michaelson's ""The Way I Am"". I stopped because I didn't want to get caught, but I didn't look around -- just packed up quickly and tried to stuff my bandana into the open can of PBR before shoving it into my backpack. I left at a good time, because I hurried off rather quickly and only paused to ""tie my shoe"" and look around at whoever else was in the playground.
Standing near the swing set I had just been sitting on, although I knew about the Slender Man, and I was justifiably freaked. Okay, so I was a little buzzed and only looking out of the corner of my eye, but I still can't shake the image of the almost canine face and eyes peering at me. Looking back, I guess he seemed a little wistful that we didn't finish our duet, but the last thing I wanted to hear was more of that odd buzzing hum that was, The Rake trying to sing without opening it's hideous jaws.

I heard the crooning again that night as I was going to sleep


WORCESTER -- My (future)-in-laws live in Worcester. It's a pretty urban area, but a recording. The Eco-Tarium has a daily recording of the weather outside of their big window, and you can rewind and rewatch the weather, from second to second, going back for a good number of months. I didn't get to spend a lot of time going through it, but I caught a few glimpses. For the most part he just seemed to be passing by, crawling (especially disturbing at high speed replay) and at one point, but no luck


NORTH ADAMS -- Went to visit some friends here. A dying town that only lives to try to support MCLA (MA College of Liberal Arts). It's got that creepy, and they mentioned the Hoosac Tunnel (more info at http://www.hoosactunnel.net/ghost.php , for those looking for more creepypasta). Apparently there were two major sightings of him there.

The first one involved a student who took the usual dare to walk down the tunnel as far as he could. He only got a few yards in before freaking out (as you do) and turned to leave. At the mouth of the tunnel, he saw it slowly stand to reveal a naked, hairless, grey man with huge hands and no mouth. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, he was paralyzed with terror. He wasn't sure how much time passed before his friends started calling for him, and their voices reverberating down the shaft sent The Rake scurrying away on all fours again. As far as I know, the guy dropped out of MCLA and moved out of state.

The other student was also doing the Hoosac Tunnel dare and also ran into The Rake on her way out, but she claimed that the eerie presence of the tunnel and the sounds of ghostly activity diminished as The Rake came into view. It was almost a guard dog for her, despite chasing the terrified student almost all the way through. By the time she made it through the tunnel and out to the other side, she turned around to see that The Rake had vanished -- and she had re-emerged on the same side she'd first entered.


ANDOVER -- Just moved here into a big house with a bunch of friends. I was kind of hoping I'd be rid of the stories and sightings, but we managed to be sober/awake enough together to get back in one piece. As we were turning off the highway, our lights flashed through a section of woods, and I woke up fully with a jolt as I saw a flash of sickly pale skin. I was praying it was all in my whiskey-addled mind again, but I saw it a second time, more distinctly, as we made another turn away from a road that T-boned into the woods. This time he wasn't crawling, fingertips clutching the bark and powerful legs catapulting him along the same route we were taking home. My fiance didn't notice in his exhausted stupor, but he got the message that I wanted to get home and got all ""protective man-ly"" on me as we pulled up at home.

Our house is pretty large, but I hustled us out of the car and up to the front door. Luckily I'd left the door unlocked, because the last thing I'd wanted to do was fumble with my keys like some horror film cliche. We got inside, and I made the mistake of looking out the door before I closed it.

The Rake had stopped at the dinky little white picket fence that bordered our property and the road. It had snaked it's obscenely long, soul-searing eyes. I couldn't close the door, and it seemed content to just sit there and have a staring contest with me. A car drove up the road that's situated right in front of our house, blinding me with it's headlights. As it drove away, The Rake had disappeared.

I slammed the door and ran to bed.


I haven't had any indoors encounters with him yet, really don't want to. I think the sheer number of people who live with me MIGHT be deterring him. Or them.

i was to scared to watch the videos myself. [i know sad right?] 
but after news on creepypasta of the old video Useless.avi i just couldn't put myself through anything like that.
it may have been up for awhile but i'm just showing people who haven't noticed yet. there are currently three videos
The reddit user Ajax00 summarized the videos for me.


&gt;**Clean.AVI**

A 4 minute, not unlike a whimpering dog, is heard distantly, but becomes clearer as the camera stops and focuses on one particular door. After listening to the other side of the door for a moment, the camera man pushes it open. We see a blindfolded man in a dress shirt, loose tie, and shorts sitting on a covered toilet, but it doesn't seem to follow a consistent pattern either. The man stands up and begins to lick the countertop, possibly coming from the camera man. This continues for the remainder of the video until the man stops cleaning and looks directly at the camera with his blindfold still intact. The uploader comments questions the viewer: ""Look closely at the man. Do you see yourself in him? Are you re-evaluating the things you look at online? Might they be abnormal?""

&gt;**Shack.AVI**

A 3-4 minute video that takes place inside a broken down, is located somewhere along the English coast. The narrator is giving a historical commentary about WWII and military strategies (the entire video is black and white and has the sound quality of an older film), or at least I think he is. I watched the video twice (as suggested by the uploader comments) but it's difficult to pay attention to what the off-camera narrator is saying because of what's on-camera. After the camera briefly scans the room, it focuses on the center in which we see a young woman with long dark hair wearing a provocative dress. Her face is covered by a thin Jabowockeez type mask. She has a plate seated upon her lap containing what appears to be three peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. She repeatedly attempts and fails to eat these sandwiches throughout the video as her mask covers her mouth. The sandwiches are destroyed in the process and fall back to the plate in a mess. The camera scans away from the women and appears to look at a blank wall for a moment before scanning back. We see the woman appear back on screen with a muscular, nude man standing arms-crossed behind her (nothing more than chest is seen). He is outfitted with the same mask. I can't be certain if my mind is just playing tricks on me, but there also appears to be more of the sandwich remains when the camera returns. The video ends with the man looking down and the woman mirroring his action.

&gt;**Impression.AVI**

This one was the shortest but by the far most disturbing.

A 2 minute video that begins where Shack.AVI left off. We are in the shack again, as though the audible layer of the video file was corrupted. The camera pans from the floor the center of the room where the muscular man is seen. The chair in front of him is present but the woman is no longer sitting in it. He unfolds his arms part-way through the still scene and angrily throws the (now folded) chair down. The camera focuses on the chair, the man who has returned to folding his arms (in the same fashion as before, but now with an apparently rebellious undertone), and then focuses on the floor. The camera pans back up and the chair is neatly returned to its place and position at the center of the room, but the man is gone. The horrible crackling sound in the background is cutting in and out, especially as scenes cut or something dramatic (like the chair hitting the floor) happens. The scene cuts to a young girl, is seen crying, he clutches his face in what appears to be him fighting an internal struggle. He tries to wipe a tear but his mask is in the way. This continues almost in a sinusoidal way, and the exact same cuts from before are seen

""Mommy! Where are you mama?""

""Mommy!""

""Bye mama. Bye. Bye mama.""

And the next part she says is either something about the mask
The video ends with the one more loop of the footage of the crying girl and the closeup of the masked face.

Sometime the next week, about 11:30ish, so it was really dark when I headed home. When I turned onto my street, I turned on my brights, and saw a figure up the road, about halfway to my house, standing in the road. As I got closer, and it was definitely not a deer. It was upright, just green, following me with its head as I drove by. I must admit

Then school started. I went to a local university, but its eyes remained burned into my memory. The more I thought about it, the more it seemed mad as I passed it. But I had to just keep going, ignoring it. I told my buddies at the lot about it, and they said I was just tired and seeing things. I tried to believe them, and after a while, I did. One Friday we were back at the lot. It was about 10

When I turned onto my street, so I didn’t even think anything of it, until it looked up. It was unmistakable, those green eyes looking right at me. Then, from its dark face came a white line. It was a smile. It’s like it had been waiting for me since last time. I was scared out of my pants, so I kept driving, past my house, the smile left, and gaining ground, I looked back

I drove back to the lot, and I tried to act “normal”. We were there for another half hour or so, and I was still shocked, but I was getting better. Then, I guess I wasn’t looking, but I heard a scream. And then another.

Today a friend of mine told me a story.

His aunt had taken care of him since he was a small boy

""They were doing mission work in some nasty little south american country when a man burst into the mission hospital one night, something like that dumb chupacabra or whatever. They called it the White Death or the White Girl, because it was the soul of someone who hated life so much that they came back in their shrouds to kill those who told of them.

The man had been told about the vengeful spirit by his sister hours before her death. It was a girl with dead, if you weren't already aware that this thing was following you, once it got back to your house, it would start knocking on your door...

Once for you bones

Twice for your muscle

Thrice for your bones

Four times for your heart

Five times for your teeth

Six times for your eyes

Seven times for your soul

She has to repeat this on any mirror or door between you and her.

You can try to outrun her

Now the man was certain that this thing had killed his sister, but the priest turned him away when he saw that the thing was following him now - oh, that's right, I forgot about that - it can only get you if you tell someone else about it, or you saw it kill someone else. The man, after finishing his tale, stole a car from the mission

Apparently his mother and father had immediately called his aunt about this when it happened. They were found in the morning

His aunt was really drunk the night before, and he told me that he was being chased by someone, and now they were knocking on his door. I told him to stop shitting me.

He held the phone away from his face for a minute, I heard the door rip from its hinges and the dying screams of my friend.

Then a little girl's voice spoke over the line: ""WITNESS."" I hung up.

Three minutes ago someone started knocking on my door. She has to knock 28 times on my front door, let me know that my death is just moments away. I will not run - I couldn't get to my car in time anyway. She started knocking on my bedroom door a minute ago, she should be done any moment.

Prologue

Two weeks later


Ch 1

I’m getting concerned. I guess I was a bit distracted before
A chalk-white amorphous thing. A hideous, grinning with half-formed white eyes filmed over. It writhed towards me. A heat, some sort of sickening heat radiated from it, and it saw my disgust and thrived upon it.
I had hoped it would live in one of the closets


Ch 2

Today it has appendages. I am not sure if they existed before, and it crawls haphazardly along like some sort of horrid lopsided insect. It tried to follow me out through the door, but I kicked it and it did not try any longer.
It thumps around as I try to sleep
I took my cat to Daryl’s. The thing didn’t follow me. I’m glad. It may get me


Ch 3

It now has four appendages and is beginning to form a skull-like dome under its pulsing skin. It has a mouth, so it mostly wobbles around in crooked little circles. It is getting bigger, and it never stops changing. I was hoping it would stay and become some sort of indiscernible monster, but now I am sure that it is becoming a person, or at the very least something similar. I would like to kill it. I wonder if I could.

I was floating in complete darkness. I was completely aware of the fact that I was dreaming, the hypnic jerk started. The falling sensation. The feeling of my body jerking awake. And then, that was it. I forgot about it and went back to sleep without a second thought. Then, the next night, the exact same thing happened. And night after that, and the night after that. For three weeks. 

I had gotten frightened, with the strange dreams and hypnic jerks continuing, I visited him. He asked me questions. Questions that I hardly understood. He tested me. I realized after the visit, that what he did was useless. The dreams continued after that, and I didn't even know why. They got worse.

At first, almost like the darkness was forming into a room. The light was still there, dancing in the darkness. After three weeks of that, the light went away. But the silhouettes did not leave. All that time, the dreams would end with a hypnic jerk. After such a long time of dealing with those strange dreams and hypnic jerks, I had decided to not sleep.

For about three or four days, I finally fell asleep, sitting at my paper ridden desk. 

I was floating in complete darkness. Again. And then, the room got brighter. It was my room. I looked around, and I was in my room. I was at my desk. I wasn't awake, but it certainly felt like I was. My room seemed different. Creepier. Distorted. I waited. I waited for the hypnic jerk. I wanted to wake up. I wanted to be able to sleep without fear.

And then these creatures appeared. Creatures that I would be afraid of as a child. Monsters hiding under the bed and in the closet. Only these monsters weren't something a sane child would imagine. They were covered in blood, they're voices gurgled from blood gathering in their rotting throats. I screamed.

Wake up.

I told myself to wake up. I put all of the will power left in my trembling body

Wake up.

The hypnic jerk did not occur. I wanted it to happen. I wanted this hellish dream to come to an end. I screamed as the horrific creatures closed in on me. I waited. Is it possible to die in nightmares?

I closed my eyes. And then falling. I was falling. I abruptly sat up. I opened my eyes, I slept peacefully. There were no mysterious dreams, or hypnic jerks. Just sleep.

""I've got quite the distance to go

""I will give explicit directions

Time passed as Steve drove silently in the darkness of the Nevada desert.  The directions given to Steve sent his taxi out of the comforts of the city lights.  His mind blurred with ""left here"" ""right up ahead"" and ""Turn around you messed up!"" quickly got him lost.  Steve cautiously drove up the surrounding mountains that engulfed Vegas.

""I'm going to call dispatch to give them a heads up I'm out of our area"" Steve's voice was nervous and eagerly anticipated the sound of his boss back at the taxi garage.  As Steve pressed the button on the side of his walkie-talkie he gave a quick update

""Yes

""Well then about how much longer till we get there?"" Steve inquired

""Soon

Steves eyes caught a glimpse of it in the rear view mirror

The Japanese man started to laugh a little ""Up ahead you're going to have to make a hard left

The mountain pass was getting more and more treacherous and Steve kept slowly getting faster and faster.  The Japanese man stared at the blade in his hands.  ""Don't forget to turn here"" The Japanese man held up the blade jumped forward to stab Steve.  Steve quickly jerked around to fight off the Japanese man but he wasn't there.  Suddenly realizing he took the eyes off the road Steve jerked the wheel hard to the left the car was suddenly airborne.  It crashed off the side of the mountain and exploded into a great fire ball.  

The next night a taxi cab pulled up to the side of the road in a dark alley in Vegas.  An old Japanese business man slinked into the back seat holding a briefcase.  The driver asked ""Where are you going tonight.""  The Japanese man smiled

I was a Marine, I transferred from active duty to reserves  in 2009 due to my wife giving birth to our first child. So I worked as security for extra money except during my monthly and annual trainings when I would head back to Camp Pendleton each summer to train. 5 years have passed since then and I EAS in a few weeks I've done 12 years in the Corps and loved every moment of it but I have a family now. So I decided it was time for me to leave. And I did those weeks passed by fast. I had served my Country and the Corps, I was deployed many times and had lost plenty of friends. But anyway back to the story.

I was just relieved of my post at the guard's shack in front of the old abandoned glass factory. I know

-------------------------------------------------------------------

My name is wisconson12, I just don't wanna deal with the bullshit of everyday life, but all these strange (one might say scary) things happen to me. This is my encounter with slenderman.

On a regular summer night, I checked my phone to see if anyone wanted to hang. My buddy, we'll call him Buddy, texted me around 9 o'clock. We decided to meet up at his house and go for a late night walk. The catch was he with his girlfriend at the moment, so I decided to walk there to kill some time.

I depart from my house and notice the air is a little thicker than usual. It's a summer night so I took it as being a little more humid than normal. The way the moonlight hit the streets complimented the dark aura that loomed over the city. All I could think was how beautiful the city looks at night. I got a text saying Buddy was gonna be a little longer than expected (raw doggin' it) so I took a detour through the ghetto of my small urban environment. I had the sneaking suspicion that someone was watching me

This next part won't make sense, lights in the house flicker on and off. But we all joke that it's him talking to us. So as I was walking down an empty street, I noticed a flickering streetlight that was dimmer than the rest. Thinking nothing of it I continued walking until I was directly under the light. And in that moment, it stopped flickering and then ominously shined on my face, as if brighter than the rest. Was this a warning? I could no longer deny the fact that someone was watching me, but why me? I'm nothing special. Off in the distance I noticed another dim light, but this one wasn't flickering. At first I mistook the figure for a tree sapling growing behind a lamp post, thin limbs and it was very dark. It must've been a newer tree because I'm in the area a lot

Buddy was gonna meet me at McDonalds. We immediately started talking about Hannaford, and we're back on the streets. We walked back the same way I came, and found the blinking streetlight again. This time, it went out. On the ground was a note, it simply has a picture of what I had thought to be a tree, with X's for eyes.

Now I know who slenderman is, knew exactly what the picture meant. We brushed it off as kids playing a game, or some kind of joke on each other. I didn't really wanna bother with it. I did notice that the new tree was gone. Well, not gone, but moved. I told this to Buddy, and he urged me to check it out. I told him it was a waste of time, but there wasn't much else to do.

Buddy convinced me to go and look at the tree. It moved over to a nearby park that had a fence bordering it's limits. Inside there was a soccer field and a jungle gym. I sat down on the swing while Buddy searched for the tall being. ""It's probably slenderman, I couldn't hear anything, nothing but a faint and indistinguishable sound. It sounded vaguely like white noise, from a radio that was not tuned to a station. The next thing I saw was Buddy dangling from a tree, tied up with some kind of black arm. I guess I was right, it was slenderman. ""Fuck"" I thought to myself. I really did not want to deal with this shit tonight. I had to free the expressionless Buddy from the clutches of this demon, so I did. I didn't actually see slenderman anywhere

Then I woke up. It was all a dream. Just a stupid dream, I realized I was in trash bag with an unconscious Buddy being carried up a hill. I remember him telling me slenderman likes to gut his victims and leave there inside in garbage bags, so I knew I had to act. Remembering the box cutter, I effortlessly cut myself free and stabbed into slendermans back. He turned and looked into my empty soul, I didn't flinch. I could tell he was shocked. I mean who actually hurts slenderman? I got this sense of victory. I scared slenderman, I won. But he'll be back, and he won't be alone. My name is wisconson12, and slenderman is no exception.

I log onto my computer, crap, crap…’ nothing interesting. I search the web for a little longer, jumping at the sound of loud thunder outside the house. The light flashed, blinked, flickered. There was something about the rain tonight, something about the ferocity and tempo in which the rain came down at that made me uneasy. I went into my mother’s room at the end of the long hallway, a small room filled with three or four screens full of camera feed, a bright flash and a boom shook the house; rattling the windows and making me jump in fright. What a terrible night this is turning out to be.


'Blood, I shall feed. I need your blood….'

Light shone out, covering a very small radius of t	he living room. ‘Pathetic’, I grumbled. I closed the fridge door and made my way to the couch in darkness, planning on waiting the power failure out. Suddenly, and I doubled over and fell onto the carpet floor. I groaned and I checked my body but there was no extrusion of a sharp object. There was no one around me either (Why should there be?!). I relaxed and laid on the floor, breathing out hard. I sat on the couch and got my breath back, I told myself. Can this night be any worse? 


‘I can sense blood…I can almost taste it in my mouth

I’m sweating profusely, so I stumble and find my way to my mother’s bedroom, collapsing in the chair in the CCTV room. I breathe heavily, but I realise the CCTV cameras are still going. They must be going on some backup power, for security purposes I guess. I study the screens, looking for anything unusual. The only thing that’s unusual is that I’m sitting in the dark, staring at camera screens. As I look around the screens, staring at the recording on the screen. It’s a grainy recording of a boy sitting at his computer desk in the dark. The video is recording from the back of the room, slowly crawling on all fours towards the boy.

Don't want to be stuck outside in this rain any longer than I should, again. Gotta get inside, and warm up. Get to bed. Get some rest.

As the rain stings my eyes, an old farmer that lived there with his wife and kids. About five years ago, everyone was celebrating his 63rd birthday, and he was given the knife to cut the cake. AS he was about to stick the blade in the pastry, his wife drew him in for a kiss. Without warning mid-romantic gesture, his body fell forward, driving the blade deep into his wife, dead on top of her. The coroners that handled his autopsy gave the diagnosis that he had a sudden and fatal aneurysm that toppled him like a ragdoll, rumors and causes spread faster than truth and reason. To this day, as to guide their spirits home

""No rest for the wicked"" in a small town

My feet began to twinge as they told me to move on, knowing I'm getting closer to my goal. One, two, three, four, fifteen, twenty eight. And then something tells me to stop. And when I open my eyes, Grover Graves, when desegragation was beginning to take place, after having suffered from depression and Parkinson's Disease

""Keep walking, and continued my trek come.

I tried to count the steps again. One two, twenty nine, forty eight, one hundred and thirty four, two hundred and sixty one. At three hundred and fifty six, I suddenly found myself stopping once again. This time, I was in front of Sherry Bullmont's home. Sherry was my girlfriend. She really cared for me, or if it was just fate that we'd become so close, and I ruined it in one night. Less than a year together, and I have no one to blame but myself.

It's time like now that I wished I was dead.

My legs begin to spasm, and just walk"" is the only thing I told myself to do. ""You knew these roads. Get home."" And I followed my own words. I closed my eyes, and begin to count my steps again. One, two, three, twenty four, sixty seven, two hundred and forty six. At two hundred and forty seven

I've walked these roads for the past twenty seven years. It's been so long since my family moved here, walking the familiar paved ways home, after my friends had ditched me some time ago. My legs are burning, and my feet are screaming but I'm almost home. I've been walking for what seemed like hours, but I'm almost home. I have to remind myself of that, because all I want is to get home, and get to bed. Doesn't help that it's raining cats and dogs,,1374754140.0,t3_1fn4ck
