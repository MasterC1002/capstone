1358955387.0,174j9l,How NOT to make money at a soft table,CardCounter0,297,41,281,"I went to a newly opened casino this weekend.  Arrived about 2pm

Good times were had by all, the table discussed the Baltimore Ravens defense, and if the local college basketball team was going to win tonight.

And all the while, and building up my stack little by little until I had about $700 in front of me. By this time, seeing what a good time and soft table we had, quite a list of sharks had built up.

So around 5pm, sunglass wearing, ear buds plugged in internet kiddie ""pros"".

One of them was instantly feeling kind of salty when his online aggression 4bet all-in shove with pocket 10s was snap called by my pocket AAs.  He spent the rest of the time providing an after hand analysis of where the winner of the pot could have 3bet for more value or where the loser should have check folded.  

They both unplugged one of their ear buds, and what the ideal c-bet percetages where on dry flops. No more talk from the fish about old cars they used to own, or football, or who was going to win the big game.  

In fact the fish, he was replaced with more competent players who were starting to arrive or had been on the list.  I finally racked up my $500 profit myself after the last bad player left, and the game consisted of a bunch of grinders trying to steal the $4 in blinds from each other, while the internet pro kiddies were discussing if one was raising for value or raising to narrow the field with AQ.

Good job guys.  I could have spent the next few hours extracting another $500 and having a good time

1368884699.0,1ekqm7,Stanky-Leg Giveth And Stanky-Leg Taketh Away,TheMadFlyentist,191,30,67,"I encountered an interesting dynamic at the cardroom last night

I got to the poker room just after dark; it was crowded, a fellow youngster to my immediate right grumbled ""Welcome to the table, bro. This clown (motions to an elderly black gentleman sitting across from us) has been going all-in like every hand and turning over trash."" 

I thanked the guy for the heads up, and clearly had money to blow. His preflop raises were typically to $20 or more and he did not hesitate to shove on any flop that he so much as grazed. It should also be mentioned that every time he turned over a winner (or a few times, a bluff), he would shout ""STANKY LEG!"" and proceed to stand up and perform the Stanky-Leg. YouTube the dance if you are unfamiliar, and then imagine a frail, 70 year old black man doing it after throwing 4s/5s on the table for bottom-two. All of the dealers knew this man as Stanky-Leg and apparently he was typically a 5/10 player, though I've never seen him before. Honestly

As any reasonable player would, Ace-rag, and suited connectors, typically for nothing better than top pair. Of course, the ""good"" players at the table were berating him for playing ""such trash"". Luckily a guy on my left gave one very stern ""Don't tap the glass"" and the conversation shifted to football. Tim Tebow to be exact. Blech.

Anyway, Stanky bet, I shoved, SB folded and Stanky called with a ragged ace. I doubled through Stanky and offered to buy him a drink, only to find out that he had been cut off by the house. He said ""Thanks anyway, youngblood"" and gave me a fist-bump.

So, fully prepared not to play anything less than top-ten hands for the rest of the evening. Then, it happened.

One of the ""good"" players who had been berating Stanky earlier for playing trash decides to shove pre-flop from UTG for $307. That's right. 

He made some speech about how he can't seem to see any flops thanks to Stanky

Stanky stacked out $307 exactly but didn't push it forward just yet. He looked up and made eye contact with the shover. ""You ain't played a hand in two hours, I'm all the way live over here."" 

There was an awkward moment of silence as the two stared each other down

The dealer assembles the pot and the whole table watches intently as he burns one card peels off three more. The window card is the six of diamonds. Full flop is 6d7dTd. Our table goes GORILLAS. Stanky literally leaps out of his seat and screams ""STANKY LEEEEEEGGGGG"" and busts a serious move. I started laughing like a small child on Christmas morning, who couldn't be saltier. He hadn't said a word and was just sitting with fists clenched, staring at the board in disbelief. 

As though it mattered, as though he was slightly pained by the cards he had dealt. With two raps on the felt, the dealer burns one and shows us the river. The table goes silent. It's the case king.

Just when I thought that the guy with KK was gonna take his beat like a pro and quietly re-buy, THEN I RUN QUADS?!?! GOD DAMMIT!.."" A supervisor appeared behind him and tapped him on the shoulder. ""Sir,"" he said, ""you need to relax.""

Steaming, which ended right after the crazy hand did. The supervisor then handed Stanky $750 cash.

Stanky turns to the table and announces ""Guess what? I'm buyin' all y'all muhfuggas a drank!... Except for you!"" He points at the man who had KK.

Still visibly furious

Stanky leaned back



I'm not sure if there is a moral to this story or whether it's just one of the craziest things I've ever seem in a cardroom. I guess my takeaway is: pick your spots, take it like a man. Otherwise, you may cost yourself some respect, or more importantly, a free drink.

I worked for FTP at a high level and watching these Howard videos has moved me from rage to sadness to sympathy to fucking god damn rage again.  

Howard has always been great at navigating his media persona and this is no different.  It’s damage control to his image

Cutting to the chase, who knew exactly what they were doing.  I can’t say for sure if Howard knew the depths of their incompetence and where they were taking  the company. I can say that with the move to Dublin, Howard really did lose touch with what was going on.   

 Did Howard and company empower Ray and turn a blind eye to what was happening

I remember when guys like Perry and Juanda disappeared, but here we are. Oh, and I do remember Alan’s last name. lol. He was a good guy and left because he also realized it was a bad company to hitch his wagon to.  

It disgusts me that despite board members realizing how incompetent Ray was that he was allowed to continue running the company.  

It disgusts me that Howard is trying paint a bad picture of board members who recognized a problem. FTP was always run like an old boy’s club

We couldn’t enforce our normal policies against “big poker names” when the situation warranted. We were told “I’ll talk to them.” From Howard himself.  I hated it.  

•	Aldernay License? – Yeah

•	The idea that they didn’t know they were circumventing banking protocols is absolutely ridiculous.  

•	Hiring competent managers? LMAO … Just check out how many Bitar family members were on the payroll.  

•	If you do some research

•	Player’s rights and experience were never a priority


Anyways… feel free to AMAA … about the Howard videos or my time with FTP.  In order to protect my identity and previous coworkers I'll be general and non-specific in some areas.  

Proof: here are some internal documents only an employee would have had access to.. have fun looking at how we did things.  If this isn’t enough… let me know and I’ll do a 7 hour interview to try and prove my legitimacy.

So I apologize if the formatting of this comes out poorly

Edit: The concepts I cover within this post are by no means to be considered ""fully covered"". If you could learn everything you need to know about when to cbet flops or what opponents are best to bet against from a simple post, this is just a general summation.

So it seems that the general theme that was being pervaded in the previous post was that continuation betting will alleviate all these problems that arise from tight or passive play. The simple answer to this, while sometimes simply taking the pot down on the flop. But, as poker players, we should always avoid making blanket statements. Why should we avoid doing things like that? Well the simple answer is that every situation in poker is unique. While continuation betting (cbetting from this point on) may yield profitable results when we have AKss and the board comes out 883 vs. a tight player, it does not always yield the same results when we cbet the same board, with the same hand, vs a loose passive player. 

While the previous post had some good ideas within it, it is misleading and must be corrected (I'm just trying to save everyone a little money here). 

So
      
* For value: The main reason that we generally raise our hands in the first place is for value. This simply means that we either have a strong hand that is worth protecting

* To take an aggressive edge in the hand: This is the point that the OP in the previously stated thread was attempting to achieve. A lot of time in poker, and many profitable players use, to simply say that by being more aggressive than your opponents, you will yield profitable results, is a fallacy. You need to understand **why** it is that you are betting, is it to take the pot down immediately because our opponent has a 75% fold to cbet, is it to set up profitable turn and river double or triple barrel bluffs

* In order to exploit a weak player that is playing a marginal range

So, jungleman, durr, ivey, ect, will ever be able to offer you simple blanket type advice that is going to bring your game to a new level. If that were the case, I would have simply stopped with ""cbetting is not always profitable"". But the point of this thread is to explain when and why it's profitable to cbet

* To retain the aggressive edge: This means that you are cbetting the flop mainly because your opponent tight passive, but it alone is not reason enough to always cbet. 

* For value: This idea is simple enough

* To bluff: This is done because you have a marginal hand that has no chance of winning if the pot were to come to a showdown. This is slightly the other implication made by retaining the aggressive edge

* Flop Texture: There are certain flops that are specifically good for cbetting regardless of your hand because it is incredibly likely that the board didn't hit our opponents range. Boards like 622, are all boards that the opponent must either have weak holdings, or larger pocket pairs in order to continue. If our opponent open limps in middle position and calls our button raise, and the flop comes out 622, the only hands that they can call multiple streets with are hands like 77-AA, maybe AK/AQ, or KQ if they're really bad

Those are a few reasons as to why we should be cbetting

* Playing vs loose/passive villains: These are the types of opponents that will limp K4o in early position (EP), so they're not going to start folding simply because you're representing pocket aces. 

* You have a marginal hand: While on the surface, you have a limper in middle position, you isolate the limper (for value), he calls, and the flop comes out: QhJs3c. What do you do on this board? Do you simply cbet, and hope to take it down, or do you check and get confused about where you are in the hand? The answer is neither of these things. What you should be thinking about when attempting to determine whether a bet or a check is appropriate in this position, and it is the basic puzzle solving mechanism that every single professional poker player takes in order to better determine what it is that their opponent is holding. In this example, its safe to say that our opponent very likely got a piece of that board, is to watch what they bring to showdown. Did they limp pocket fours in early position

* You are playing against an aggressive opponent: This idea is one of the more difficult ones to employ because it implies that our opponent is a thinking player, KsTs3h). The reason this is profitable for them is because if they know that you are simply cbetting all of your hands after the flop, so they can start to exploit that to earn more money off of you where you would have checked in order to retain pot control under normal circumstances. 

* To retain pot control: This idea is practiced in order to keep pots small when the board comes out dangerously, and the turn comes the Kh. Now there are multiple hands that beat you that only call on the flop. AQ, Q9, any hearts, KJ, TJ. Even if this is the first time seeing this concept, everyone knows that feeling, my aces just got cracked"" feeling. And it exists for a reason, coupled with the implication of our opponents range, so I wont delve into that topic today

While cbetting a lot of flops may have been the bread and butter of poker players for many years, otherwise you risk stagnating your own poker career. 

TL;DR It is not always appropriate to cbet boards, and positional implications before you will know whether or not it is appropriate to cbet. ",,False,,t5_2qhix,1365087838.0,,

.


Preface

My life has generally been pretty boring, and with just one pair.  I thought that this was a pretty wild night, and it was certainly momentous for me personally, but little did I know my life experience was just getting started.  Not soon after this, I'd lose $72K in an eight hour session of 100/200/400 HA after being awake for 2 days straight; shortly after that, I'd find out one of my closest friends had joined a cult; and the week after that, I'd wake up groggy

.

Trip Report – Part 1:  Top Pair on the Turn [February 2012]

Our four-man team formed last year [2011] after the Series,000 and just taking a shot at 2-5.  I had been a 50nl and 100nl grinder, another poker friend of mine had been a low stakes MTT grinder, and two others both worked for poker TV productions.  So after Black Friday, we were all four of us out of a job and trying to figure out what to do next.  Teaming up with that $4k was the best idea that we could come up with.  Not good mind you, just the best one we could think of.

The four of us ran hot at those 2-5 games early on, I had always been very nitty in my bankroll-management.  My teammates have been slowly ingraining in my head the wisdom of aggressive shot taking and just generally finding a way to get out of a life of grinding, and it's finally beginning to kick in.

.

With $10K of the team's $45K on me, in the second table of the 5-10 – a must move into the main game.  From my seat, I have a clear view “upstairs” on the 10-20 game that goes regularly, now with about 5 players.  I get up a few times and walk to the bathroom by the sports book—and the 10-20—scoping out the game from afar.  It looks pretty soft.  Aggro, but soft.  One guy in particular seems to be barreling 3 streets pretty frequently.  So when I get called for the main game, instead I head to the cashier and change up a rack of orange $10 chips to a few stacks of the brighter orange $20 chips, and sit in the 10-20 with $3K for my buyin,000 in cash and two and a half stacks of 20's.

The second hand I manage to run AK into queens preflop in a straddled pot, I pretty quickly run TT into what I assume must be 99 or AQ from Mr. Aggro (the guy who had been barreling a lot when I was scoping the game out earlier), because when we run it twice, he mucks, and with the bottom board containing a king and the top board having a jack, eight and seven on it, I just can't figure what other possible hands he could have had.

Sitting on $6K and even for the night after that double-up, and fairly aggressive, so even small-ish pots have a grand in the middle, ergo grinding up $3K isn't that difficult of a task.)  Mr. Aggro, the guy who had been barreling a lot, had contributed about $1500 to my work up in addition to his 99/AQ hand, now has $6K left, perfectly happy to stay in this game even without him playing, as he aggressively spews to the table.  I manage to “only” pick up $3500 more from him while he gets himself down to about $14K

.

Then the following hand occurs:

Mr. Aggro's in the sb, the button folds, and Mr. Aggro makes it $140 to go.  I have JcTs and 3-bet to $420 in order to isolate him and get HU in position.  The limper does indeed fold and Mr. A calls.  The flop is 8c7d2h and Mr. A leads out $900, almost pot.

His bets have been on the bigger side all night, two probable overs, position, and plenty of stack left behind, I opt to call.  (I felt if I raised, I open the door for him to jam, which was a real concern with this player.)  I manage to bink the Tc, but a card that puts me well ahead on average.  He checks, and worse pair-plus-draws

He instantly check-raises to $3600,000 actual cash.  (Bear in mind last year I was grinding 50nl online, so this was definitely a step up...)

Well fuck.

I don't want to commit myself with the hand here, sets, straights, etc. often enough to overcome the sheer number of draws and outright bluffs he might have.  And if I just call, the pot will be $10K, a perfect size for shipping $8K on the river into me.  I think Gus Hansen once (jokingly?) called the small blind the best position because it's the first one to bet.  As far as how the river is going to play out if I just call his raise, I think he's got it spot on.

And what am I going to do then when he jams the river

But if I'm just closing my eyes calling off

*600 big blinds—twelve thousand dollars—with top pair.*

I'm not initially fond about that prospect.

But the straddle

In goes the money.  If I lose

Mr. Aggro tanks and tanks and eventually asks me if I'll run it twice.  Although I generally only run it once (to maintain fold equity), I answer that I always (“always” being the lie) run it twice, and no sooner than the word “twice” leaves my mouth is he moving his money over the betting line.

Well shit.  I was really hoping to take down the pot.

Oh well, we run the river twice, two beautiful blanks fall off, and I'm being pushed a $25,000 pot won with top pair.  With the g-ball I won at the 5-10 earlier, this puts my total net for the net at about $20K.  Mr. A leaves, and we play for about a half hour before it's pretty clear that the game is done without him, I manage to stay mostly numb to this turn of events and continue to play my game

I'm told the wait list for a box at the Bellagio is about 3 years, not really wanting to spend the extra effort to take the long walk and tram over to the Aria to put it in my box there.  It seems dumb when I say it that way, but only a few months ago, my car had broken down, and I didn't really feel I had the budget for a new car just yet, so I was regularly taking the 202 up and down Flamingo with $10K-$15K in my backpack— basically, my bar for doing dumb shit like carrying lots of money

(Poker money isn't money after all

Anyway, and it was certainly fairly momentous for me personally, but little did I know that my poker and life experiences were just getting started.  Not soon after this, I'd lose $72K in an eight hour session of 100/200/400 HA after being awake for 2 days straight; shortly after find out one of my closest friends had joined a cult; and the week after that, I'd wake up groggy, confused and alone in a “by the hour” motel in Tijuana.

###Important Starting Concepts

* **You Suck...but so did everyone.** So maybe you do OK in your home game, there is an outside chance you're just a poker genius, but in all liklihood, you actually have no idea what you're doing and have simply gotten lucky so far. Right now, you just don't know what you don't know. Don't let your ego stop you from improving and don't be a victim of the [Dunning-Kruger effect.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) The rabbit hole of poker knowledge is so incredibly deep, that I could hardly believe it once I started studying.

* **[List of terminology and abbreviations](http://archives1.twoplustwo.com/showflat.php?Number=5988672).** There are some terms that are not covered. If you come across something you don't know

* **Where to play online.** For US players, search for rakeback deals. Poker rooms make their money from the rake which is a percentage taken from each pot. Many online sites will pay you back a portion of the rake you pay if you sign up through special referrers. Not signing up will cost you real money in the short and long run.

* **Fundamental Theory of Poker**
Every time you play a hand differently from the way you would have played it if you could see all your opponents' cards, every time opponents play their hands differently from the way they would have if they could see all your cards, you gain; and every time they play their hands the same way they would have played if they could see all your cards, you lose. See [Theory of Poker](http://www.amazon.com/Theory-Poker-Professional-Player-Teaches/dp/1880685000/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1314114900&amp;sr=1-1) by David Slansky for more.

* **What Game to Play.** I would start in no limit (NL) cash games. Limit games are pretty boring IMO and pot limit omaha is a little too crazy for new players

* **Pot Odds**. The math of poker is pretty simply until you get much farther along with analyzing equity against hand ranges

* **[Expected Value.](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/facqh/can_someone_explain_to_me_what_ev_is_and_how_to/)**

* **Tilt.**
[Tilt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt_\(poker\)) sucks. It is the bane of all poker players. The 2+2 anthologies below contain a lot of great strategies for dealing with. Please don't [stab yourself in the foot](http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/54/poker-beats-brags-variance/14-000-downswing-masochism-hospital-tr-697958/) though.

* **[Variance.](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/atb92/judging_by_many_of_the_posts_in_rpoker_lots_of/)**

* **Bankroll Management.** Stolen from icanhazstax: Bankroll Management - While solid poker players have an edge against their opponents, Bankroll Management is essential for anyone looking at poker from more than just an entertainment perspective. By following ""rules"" of proper BR management, and thus having enough buyins in your bankroll to stand the possible negative variance swings, one can assure the chances of them going 'busto' (losing their entire roll) is significantly decreased. While the number of suggested buyins can be debated, 'imo' the rule is something like: Cash = 20-30 buyins, STT = 40-50 buyins, MTT = 90+ buyins. See the anthologies for more.

* **Levels of Thinking:**

1st Level: Your cards

2nd Level: What does your opponent have

3rd Level: What does your opponent think you have

4th Level: What does your opponent think you think he has

5th level: What does your opponent think you think he thinks you have

At the micros

* **Thought Processes.** Every time you make an action

- The reason for your action.

- Why that actions beats the alternatives (check, raise, shove, etc.)

- What your plan is for subsequent events.

Here is a [good example](http://archives1.twoplustwo.com/showflat.php?Cat=0&amp;Board=microplnl&amp;Number=11760459&amp;page=63&amp;fpart=1) of what you should aim your thought processes to be.

###Books

There are SO many good poker books out there. I have read a bunch

* [Harrington on Hold 'Em 1 &amp; 2](http://www.amazon.com/Harrington-Expert-Strategy-Limit-Tournaments/dp/1880685337/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1314113981&amp;sr=1-1). They are about tournament play

* [Kill Everyone](http://www.amazon.com/Kill-Everyone-Strategies-Tournaments-Sit-n-Gos/dp/1935396307/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1314114260&amp;sr=1-5). Great book on tournament poker.

* [Winning Tournaments One Hand at a Time.](http://www.amazon.com/Winning-Poker-Tournaments-Hand-Time/dp/0974150274) Another great tournament book.

Now, you may be able to find pdf versions of some of these books [here](http://www.bestpokertorrents.com/-/Poker-e-Books/Poker-Text-Books).

###HUD Software

If you're going to be playing online with any sort of seriousness, so maybe see what works for you.

Once you get your HUD established

* Voluntarily put $ into the pot (VPIP) / Preflop raise % (PFR) / Aggression Factor (AF) / # of hands

and once you are comfortable with understanding those

* Steal attempts / fold to steal in the small blind (SB) / fold to steal in the big blind (BB)

* Continuation bet (cbet) flop / Cbbet turn / fold to flop cbet / fold to turn cbet

* 3 bet / fold to 3 bet / call 3 bet / 4 bet

Pretty soon after Jerry started playing at my table, et cetera.  He casually asked if I ever play higher limits and I mentioned that no I wasn't really rolled for that.  After a few hours, he got up for a smoke break and asked me to come join him, where he proceeded to inform me that he runs a lot of private games around California and he makes money in them by staking good players, and he thinks I'm worthy of being staked.  The next night, he says, he has a 50-100 game up in San Francisco.  So I give all my team and personal money to my teammates (in case Jerry was trying to rob me), who I'd just met.  I proceeded to lose $50K running second nuts into the nuts, I was still pretty stoked.  It was an exciting past few days.

Jerry still wanted to continue to stake me, we realized that these games only go very rarely.  They hinge on a few rich businessmen who often change their mind about what they want to do for the night -- and obviously it's poor business to let them know the games just don't go if they don't show up.  So I'm often running over to LA from Vegas on the slim likelihood of a game.  My teammate Jack lives in Ventura and he's managed to play a few of the bigger ones.  The biggest game he was in was 300/600 PLO held [at the house from this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDXmJ-AbE4Y) Charlie Sheen car commercial.  Jack won “only” $30K that night, having lost a $186K pot in a game with Ben Lamb, and with Ben and our staker Jerry flipping coins for $5K a pop.  (Literally, they were throwing quarters in the air.  True coin flipping).

We've always been in the red in these Jerry games, it's just funny money.  We've never been paid from them.  I don't actually even know Jerry's last name.  That being said, all we have to do is bink one good night and we're set—assuming we actually do get paid.  So we always have to be ready to go at a moment's notice for these games, even though we're still down overall.

We were only $25K in make-up when Jack got a call about this 100/200 game in San Francisco.

I was hot off a recent [$20K win at the Bellagio 10-20](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/194qfa/trip_report_1_top_pair_on_the_turn/), so even though it was mid-day, I was in bed for the day... but I couldn't sleep, so I went to the Aria played 2-5 since the 5-10 didn't look very good.  I didn't want to scope out the Bellagio for the 10-20 because I was really tired (and also the Yellow Curry Chicken from Lemon Grass at the Aria is just too good to pass up).  I had been playing for a few hours when I got a text from Jack saying there was a Jerry game in San Francisco the next day, so I cashed out and tired though I was, I drove to LA.  Our teammate Corey was working, and the other teammate, had already committed himself to [some leadership seminar or something](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/19mncj/daniel_negreanu_antonio_esfandiari_for_choice/c8pm4z9); therefore

Books on tape are a good way to pass time, but that wonderful 5-10 managed to perk me right up.

It was a good game.  In fact it was a REALLY good game.  Jack and I knew if the Jerry game went, since the games always seem to fizzle out, so even though it was getting late now, and I hadn't slept in a long time, we kept on playing the juicy 5-10 game rather than get a good night's sleep.  At about 9:30am the next morning, the last player in the game quit playing Jack and me 3-handed, so we finally went home to sleep, since we hadn't heard anything, not eight.  We need to leave right now.  Unshowered

Groggy as we were, if my opponent was good, I should just raise here with most of my range, but he's terrible, so I can just flat here and even if the club does hit, he'll tell me whether or not he has it.  No, I can't make this river call, he just has it.

I don't like opening myself up like that, and 300-600) are just miles softer than 100nl post-UIGEA online, and exploitative play is obviously the best for live games.

As we were about an hour away from San Francisco, but Jerry's friend Sam, who was running the game, said that apparently they have private poker “parties” all the time, and the hotel loves to accommodate that.  So apparently he'd found a good permanent home for hosting his games.

After we had parked, and I stopped in the less-than-sparkling parking garage bathroom to wash my hands and run a comb through my hair.  As long as whatever stickiness was on the floor didn't manage to get on the TOP of my shoes, I felt like I might actually pull the charade off.  I'm more of a shorts, tee shirt, and flip flops guy myself, so this dress-up was kind of foreign to me.  But for a 50-50 split stake in a 100/200, I can find a way to live with it.  After I got out of the bathroom, chugged one right there

The game itself was actually pretty uneventful.  Everybody bought in for $20K or so and we started out at 100-200 no limit holdem.  (Nobody brings cash to these things; it's just taken care of on a laptop spreadsheet, easily soft enough to beat the exorbitant 5% $200 max rake that finances the whole shebang, but I was not getting any cards, and pretty quickly re-bought, so I was sitting on $25K and in the game for $40K for a good chunk of the night.  It was a pretty boring game.  The only interesting hand was that Jack managed to bluff somebody off of a one card A-high flush convincing him that he had one of two possible two-card straight flushes.  Jack had air and just thought the guy's river raise was FOS.  (Later we found out that the guy was a “pro” friend of the main fish in the game, and was playing scared because he was being staked by the fish.  The fish doesn't know Jesse and Sam know this and let it happen because his “pro” isn't very good.)  Jack showed the bluff after the “pro” folded his ace face up and we all had a chuckle about it.

After that, and then eventually also a round of PLO8.

PLO is approximately 4 times swingier than holdem per blind level.  This is because hand values are closer together equity-wise, getting all-in is much easier and more common in PLO than in no limit holdem.  That fact, combined with everybody straddling for $400 made my losing another $20K seem completely normal.  Before I knew it, I was sitting on about $40K, but in the game now for a cool $100,000.

Once again, and we were stuck playing 4-handed with me and Jack, and Sam the host, and Mike, the main businessman fish of the game.  For whatever reason, we all agreed to switch the game back to just NLHE, and Jack and I began really eating away at Mike's chips.  Sam fairly quickly stopped the game when Mike had $10K left and looked ready to rebuy.  When Jack and I talked to Sam later -- fairly pissed about him stopping the game -- he explained that this particular fish was the type to get REALLY upset if he lost everything and not want to play for a few months, but if the man is going to give me $100K to play poker with and not come knocking on my door the next day when I lose it

All told, so adding that net -$65K to our already -$25K, we were now in the hole $90,000 for the Jerry games.  It sucks, but many people have had big six figure nights, so like I said before, it only takes one good night to make it all worth while.  Jack said that Mike Baxter spewed over a million in that 300/600 PLO game he played, since these games only seem to go once every few months

It was about 2:00am and the game was over.  We were both dead tired, giving him a chance to nap, and we pulled into his house at about 7:30.  He only got a few more hours sleep before getting up with his family, but I happily slept all day on their kid's bed while they were all out.  I'd been up for something like 3 days after all.

That night, but home is home, and I desperately needed some rest and relaxation.  A nice break.

Live poker is played with real cards and chips.  You have to look at your cards and remember them, and everybody immediately checks their cards to see if they have spades, after which some have looks of disappointment and some are betting with a new gleem in their eyes.  This ain't gonna happen online.

You always have the whole betting with chips thing.  Online, and you just bet $10.75.  Live you have string bets, single chip rule, misstacking chips, fake pumps, etc.  Online you also have numbers all over the place.  Each player's balance is displayed neatly in front of them, while live everybody has random stacks of chips (and you will have to notice that guy has two black chips sitting on top of that stack of red).  The bets are displayed as little number, and the total in the pot is another neat little number

So after you figure out the mechanics of how to properly bet and raise and once you get over the having to look at your cards and remember them, and remember to keep track of what has gone into the pot -- you will probably notice that there are no numbers floating over the player's heads in a live game.  The fact that chuckle head across the table from you is playing like 40% of his hands?  You have to track and make a note of that yourself.  If you were busy on your cellphone tweeting your buddies about how lol soft live games are, you won't know that when you do get in a hand with chuckle head, there will not be a 45/5/5 floating above his head.  You have to keep track of who is loose, who is aggressive, and who never cbets with less than top pair.

Other things that happen in live games that are impossible online -- players act or try to act out of turn, the turn card gets dealt prematurely.  Never gonna happen online.

Okay

Part 2: The play.

The first thing you will notice is everybody limps.  People do not drive for an hour to a casino to fold cards.  They got two cards, and they have thrown in some money they for sure aren't folding, which brings us to the second difference, preflop raise size.  The 2.5x online preflop raise is a joke.  In for $2?  Might as well call $20!  So for raises to mean anything, you have to raise 5xBB or more, and you are probably still going to get callers, since like I said, and is snap called by the next player, and you probably aren't going to isolate.  And you will probably be playing for a while before you get a chance to attempt to steal blinds

Despite the limping and large raises, ATs, AJo ..."", no dude - he 3bet, it's QQ+ maybe AKs.  Also the range of 66+ is a joke in a live game.  Anything a live player will or won't do with 77, he is equally likely to do or not do with 44.  There is no range of 66+.  It is either 22+ or 99+ (or maybe 22+, 88/99+, it's not JTs thinking about fold equity ... You better have AA because the other guy either has your other two Aces

Could go into much detail about live play differences -- I will just add one more.

Flop c-bet.  With everybody limping, 1/4 pot bet that means ...""  No dude, that wasn't a quarter pot bet.  That was a bet of $25.  $25 is a lot of money, $25 buys a lot of beer.  Live players do not think in terms of pot size.  They think in terms of $25 is big bet, $10 is small bet ...  So on the river, a $75 bet into a $300 pot isn't lol snap call, it is wow that guy might really have something.

Maybe others can add more details...

1371963898.0,1gw82w,Poker ABC's: How To Analyze A Hand,Protential,98,18,27,"There seem to be very few posters on here who know how to analyze a simple hand. The majority of posts amount to ""I would do this...blah blah blah

Yes, it is both difficult to take you seriously and also tough for others to learn. (which is why some people post here, specifically hands)

Thus I am going to write up a short and simple guide on how to break down hands

I am going to build a hand and take you step by step of how I get to the conclusion of whether or not we played the hand correctly in a simple spot. 

**The Situation.**

9 Handed tournament. Blinds are 50-100

Hero is Delt On the Button:

[](/As) [](/Ks)

*Folds to Hero who raises to 3bb

**Step 1:** Figure out their Pre-Flop ranges. (This is done by guessing what type of players they are and estimating what hands they might flat/3bet with). 

This is by far the easiest and one of the most important parts of playing a hand

Lets say in this spot that both villains are fairly loose passive out of the blinds

Thus both of their ranges might look like this:

(To build these ranges I pulled out PokerStove and put in hands a loose passive player might call with)

SB:TT-22,Q8s+,J8s+,T8s+,97s+,87s,76s,AQo-A9o,T9o

BB:TT-22,Q6s+,J7s+,T7s+,97s+,86s+,75s+,54s,J8o+,76o

**Step 2:** Figure out what kinds of hands will continue vs us on the flop, sometimes fold, call, sometimes call, only 3bet or sometimes 3bet). 

Now lets say that the flop is:

[](/Ac) [](/7s) [](/8s) 

*Both villains check to us.* 

To figure out whether or not we should bet, we use PokerStove to look at how our hand does vs these ranges, what % of their ranges hit, and how well our hand does vs hands that continue vs us. 

I'd assume that for these kinds of players

AJs-A2s,KsTs,Ks9s,QsJs,QsTs,Qs9s,JsTs,T9s,65s

Thus SB will continue 14.5/24.6 (59%)  and BB will continue 14.5/45.1 (32%). 1 person will continue 72% of the time. (0.41 x 0.68 = 28% both fold) 

Vs the above range AKs has 80% Equity. Because 1 person will continue a lot vs us

*So into a pot of 900

**Step 3:**Have a plan based on how well we do vs their ranges

*Out of simplicity's sake we will state that sb folds

Now that we have seen their actions

AJs-A9s,KsJs,KsTs,Ks9s,Kc8c,Kd8d,Kh8h,QsTs,8c7c,6d5d

AKs has 86% Equity vs this range. 

The Turn: [](/6h) 

The above range has 33% equity vs us on this turn, only 1.6% (18% of the range) is ahead of us. Vs this kind of player, if they raise us on the turn, we can assume that they caught up/have us crushed, and vs the hands that do so, we have only 23% Equity (A6, 910, 78s).

Thus as pretty much all of their range is continuing and as it has a lot of equity vs us, while if they check/raise us small we can peel and hope we hit a K/s. 

*Hero bets 1500 into a pot of 2200. Villain Calls.* 

**Step 4:**Figure out what part of their range will react in what manner, or check behind. Also, understanding what part of their range will react based on sizing is fairly important as well vs more competent players. 

As villain called us on the turn

AJs-A9s,KsJs,KsTs,Ks9s,QsJs,QsTs,Qs9s,Js9s,6h5h

River:   [](/7h) 

*Villain checks to us. Hero bets 3000 for value.* 

Here is why: 

As villain is loose passive, we could lean twards betting really small and hope we induce a jam, but as villain is not we should purely be betting here to get calls. Based on their above range, nearly all of their range is Ax or a busted draw, with a couple 98/65 type hands, thus a lot of their range is semi-weak value (bad top pairs) and will call a fair sized bet as a bluff catcher, however as much of it is fairly weak

When we bet  I'd expect to get called by:

AJs-A9s, or around 65% of the time based on their river range. 

**Results:**

**DON'T FUCKING MATTER.** (For a single hand)

If you have any thoughts/concerns/suggestions on things I can add to this to make it easier to follow/read

Thanks!/You're Welcome!

Edit: Pertaining to results. For a single hand, that doesn't mean I'd always include sets in their flop/turn/river calling ranges, I might have 1/5th of possible set combos to compensate a bit for it, and add in more combos if they continue to show up with sets in the future in this kind of spot.

Some of you may remember a [post I made almost three years ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/dmltv/five_weeks_ago_i_quit_my_job_and_started_playing/) after quitting my job to make a run at full-time poker. I was relatively inexperienced

I still play poker as my primary income. I’m almost three years into it, and our three children by playing low- and mid-stakes cash games.

**What I Enjoy**

Freedom and flexibility are by far the biggest benefits of playing for a living. I answer to no one. Not clients, we can take a trip with no notice at all, and we’ve done so quite a few times. Pick a destination with a poker room nearby, and pack up the car. I took my family to Florida three times last year, and that’s where I am now. We’ve also been on ski trips on a week’s notice, and I never have to miss a kid's baseball game or track meet because of work. When a tornado tore through my hometown last month, I was able to take time off from poker and volunteer with the recovery effort; I didn’t need to call anyone and get permission.

The game itself is still fairly enjoyable, for the  most part, there to have fun, so if you can put up with old man jokes and a few egos, the social aspect is fine. I’ve made some good friends through poker — dealers, other regs, even the waitress that always cheers me up when I’m running bad.

The money is also nice. I never made much money outside of poker (since I was a PhD student living on fellowships, $63 for $2/5 NL, and $89 for $5/10 NL. I’ve played a little 1/2 NL as well, mostly waiting for other games to open or when I want to socialize with friends at 1/2 games, and I’m at $34/hr in those games over the last 18 months. Last year I made a little less than I am this year at $2/5 NL, but I think I’m playing better now. The samples are so small in live poker that it’s impossible to really draw any big conclusions from hourly rates over six months or a year, so I won’t pretend that it’s significant. I included it because I thought people would be curious. I play a few tournaments when larger series come through town

Finally, variance, and bad runs have had a very positive influence on my emotional control and ability to adapt to bad news away from the table. Refrigerator breaks? I lost two refrigerators on the river yesterday. Car needs a big repair? I bluff-caught yesterday for that amount. The ups and downs of poker have made me much more even-keeled, and it’s pretty tough to upset me now; my work on my mental game, tilt control, and emotions at the table have no doubt spilled over into my personal life and my other competitive endeavors.

**What I Don’t Enjoy**

Even though I spend lots of time with my kids, sometimes I feel like I’m wasting my life playing poker as much as I do. This is probably a feeling I would have trapped in a cubicle, or maybe even if I’d gotten an academic job. But poker seems even more pointless than being a tiny cog in a large corporate machine. At least that corporate machine produces something; I don’t. Poker no doubt enables me to do some great things (like travel, be with my sick kids, and have time to dedicate to important other projects), but poker itself doesn’t seem to count as doing anything at all. I try to counteract that by spending my time away from the table living well and being productive, but we Americans seem to put a lot of stock in our professional lives.

Obviously, the inane conversations, etc. But there’s some analogue to that at any job around other people. I think I witness more blatant sexism and racism playing poker than I would at most jobs. That pisses me off. Just yesterday I heard one of the most racist conversations at the poker table, as an old man lamented his daughter’s choice in husbands. He justified his racism with, “My granddaughter is mixed, so I can say this…” And then he repeated every negative stereotype in the book. Then he said his granddaughter is lucky that she won’t be around all that “nigger shit” because her father died last year. Seriously, my jaw hit the table and I was speechless. That’s an extreme example, but I don’t think I’d hear that sort of thing at most traditional jobs. And if I did

**EDIT**

I deleted a section at the end that didn't seem to add much

I had the chance to join a family business about a year ago. It included a decent salary and benefits, but it would have required moving, so the combination of moving, entering a business I wasn't excited about, and losing the freedom I have made it a pretty easy decision, so I passed on it.

Also, but I don't think coaching, for me, will ever be more than that.

Also, and partly we feared negative reactions. Once I decided to give up the academic job search, we told everyone. By that time it was pretty difficult for them to tell us we'd go broke since I had a year under my belt. I still didn't enjoy that conversation with my father-in-law.",,False,,t5_2qhix,,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/1h8ryh/update_on_my_life_in_poker/

-----------------

.

   My path to learning poker started with my grandfather.  When I was in junior high and high school, but alas the house edge always catches up to them.  Still, after some discussion, for a Christmas present he sent me a book he claimed would prove his case to me, a book by some mathematician from the 60's or something, a guy named Edward Thorp.

   I finished that book that night, and the nature of counting cards at blackjack was a revelation to me.  I always knew the casinos won money because they paid less than the true odds of the events, but it had never occurred to me that this advantage might fluctuate around, even towards the player at certain points.  I soon devoured everything I could in all of the blackjack circles, even taught myself the Hi Opt II count, and after my high school classes were over for the day, I would occasionally run over to a nearby Indian casino and place minimum bets and practice counting.  I also started looking at other games—I found out about physical defects and biases in roulette, optimal play at full pay deuces wild video poker

   When I got rejected from USC and UCLA—undeterred and still wanting to study film, no essay, you could apply online, and registration was open until the first day of school... jackpot!  While my parents weren't thrilled about it, it was still a university, and I'd be in college in the fall, so they begrudgingly agreed.  My mom wasn't thrilled when she dropped me off at school and read in the school paper an op-ed piece by s student-stripper complaining about potential legislation to make even non-alcoholic strip clubs hire 21+ year olds instead of 18+ because how else was she going to pay for college?

   Despite their intense reservations, a kid in the dorm across from me mentioned that some people he know were playing a dorm poker tournament, and he thought I'd like to know since I'm so into gambling.  Even though I never learned poker, I decided to throw $20 in for the tournament, and without even really knowing what the rules were, I luck-sacked my way into a win, a whopping $140 from the two table tourney, it was still immediately apparent to me that poker contained all the good aspects I liked about gambling, and with such disparity

   Aside from my courses, at no limit holdem cash games.  This was easy at first, because in 2003-2006, money was pretty much raining from the sky on Party Poker, and logging on and making a few hundred or even a thousand or more, both at the cash games, and at the 10-hand-per-level sitngos, and although I didn't know photoshop, I went back home to Seattle, I had no reason to think they were wrong.

   Six months of job searching later, and I felt completely worthless.  Even though in Washington state it was a Class C Felony on par with sexual assault, I continued to play online poker at night for something to do and to keep my mind off of being a miserable failure.  (It's actually only a felony if you play “as income”, and nobody's been prosecuted.)  Six months of job searching turned into almost two years, and I was going to therapy for depression and frequently contemplating suicide.  It was also frustrating my parents who also believed that I should have been able to find a job, and when my mom said I should work at McDonald's to at least have SOMETHING, I finally snapped and decided that if I was going to fail like this, and I was going to do the only thing I had ever known to make money.  That night I cashed out my $1000 of my $3000 balance on Full Tilt, and if I busted

   I found some old college friends who had an extra room for rent in a cheap house, so even accounting for food, I could survive on less than $700 or $800 a month.  This was in April 2009, and although I lived in Las Vegas, I was spending my time grinding 50NL 6-max online, and by god I was treating it as a profession.  I made sure to get my fat ass out and go for a walk or light jog every day, I played in 2-3 hour spurts, then put in another session, each lesson $50 an hour for 2 hours... and I put in a minimum of 30, but I was managing to cover my costs and even save up a few hundred every month.  And with the light exercise

   I had also taught myself to deal poker, because they just need 1000 people every year, and nobody who's decent at dealing is going to leave their good paying job for a two-month stint that doesn't pay well.  So when Black Friday hit on April 15th, I did two things—I went to the last audition for dealing they held at the Rio (and passed!)—and I started looking up ways to get around the restrictions for US players.  I also found out that a poker friend of mine was apparently contacted by a guy representing Bill Chen, Jerrod Ankenman, and Matt Hawrilenko, to test a winner-take-all sitngo strategy they had developed.  (One which, I think could easily just be spit out by Sit N Go Wizard.)  So even with Black Friday

   With the money I had saved every month grinding 50NL, after my expenses, I was still sitting on over $10k at the end of the Series, and really thrilled to death about it.  I'd been living very cheaply for over two years, and having a bankroll of $10k was a big deal.  Some of my poker friends who were also now out of work thanks to Black Friday came to me with a suggestion that we each put up a grand, and we take that combined $4K and just take a shot at 2-5 and see where it would lead.  With more money than I'd ever had, I was balling and eager to do it, and drive down to San Diego and play in the Ocean's 11 juicy $1500 buyin 5-5 and stay a few nights in order to get in on their recurring Tuesday and Friday 10-20, play the 5-5, although we were running pretty bad in those—but all it would take is a single good night

   So I was very upset to learn that it looked like our team might be falling apart.  Ben was committing more and more time to something called the Choice Center, and was just generally going off in an entirely different direction.  Jack had moved to Ventura and was money hand over fist dealing at the same Ventura Player's Club that was our own private gold mine for a lot of our bankroll increase, and he also had his own private staking offers from the people there who had seen all of us play and had also gotten to know him personally and see that he's a trustworthy guy.  Corey wanted to spend more time with his family and these frequent trips to California were really making life difficult at home.  It seemed that I was the only one who really wanted to keep the team going.  And on top of it all, we'd been running bad recently and the roll was back at about $70K.  This meant if we split up, I'd have $17.5K as my share—enough to play $2-5, but by no means enough to continue sitting on my throne at the 10-20 and living the high life.

   So I was pretty depressed when we all reconvened in San Deigo for one last hurrah at the Ocean's 10-20, so when we finally parted ways, my share of the roll was $16,000.  I was feeling really down, since the team was not only the “high life”, they were also my closest friends next to Tim.  Luckily for me, Tim and J.J. had a really great idea for curing depression and we hopped in the car and headed for the border.

   It took a lot of time for me to recover from that and integrate back into a normal life.  I still haven't fully recovered.  To this day, he was very apologetic.  He knew I had already been depressed about the team, and he felt terrible for being a catalyst of my break down.  I knew he didn't know how bad off I was, and that he meant no harm, and we're still close friends.

   Even though I'm not in a super dark place any more, and since I no longer have the team for backup, I've reverted back to my old bankroll-nit ways.  I'm playing 1-2 live with occasional shots at 2-5, and playing 0.50/1 on Stars and 10-20 on Seals With Clubs, about the equivalent of 100nl at current bitcoin exchange rates.

   I didn't post this for a while, and also ashamed about revealing that I'm no longer the high stakes baller I once was.  But in the past few weeks, I've managed to get my head on a little firmer, and pull myself back from the depths of despair, and I feel that part of my return to my former glory must be openness and honesty.  It's been a wild few years, and I'm grateful for the immense life experiences I've had along the way.  I genuinely feel like an old hand in the poker world, as silly as that may sound.  And despite being back at low limits, but damned close.  While I used to be content just grinding, my own way.  I don't know if I'll end up running sky high

So, ad-supported coaching sessions/lessons?  My general coaching method is to review tournament hand histories via a hand replayer while discussing hands/situations with my students on Skype (again, this is a review of an already completed tournament, not live ghosting a player and telling them what to do).  The uptick of twitch.tv makes me wonder if I could create enough channel viewership/buzz to make this worthwhile.

I would be focusing on the student while reviewing their history

**I (still) love poker** I know at six months I'm still young for a full-time player

**Live poker is easy. Really easy.** Some of you are no doubt losing players at live cash games, you will win money. Even when I thought I was good enough to quit my previous job, I didn’t realize how exploitable the tables I was playing were. Stay away from marginal situations and just pound your big hands. Throw in a *very* small number of well-timed bluffs, and you’re off to the races.

**Bigger stakes are overrated** My biggest surprise is that I can make a living playing $1/2. Yep, I realized after a few tough sessions at bigger stakes that the swings were torture. It’s really tough leaving work for the day after losing a quarter of your bankroll. It was unacceptable, and it put my family in jeopardy. The players are generally better as you move up (duh!). Even though I still enjoy playing $2/5 PLO, and even though I aim to become a better player at higher stakes, I realize that it’s probably impossible to beat $2/5 NLHE at the same (proportionate) rate that I beat $1/2. It’s just a different game with different players, and the fact is that I just dominate $1/2. I am profitable in just over 80% of my $1/2 sessions (as opposed to around 60% at $2/5) and I make about $50/hour at both (this includes promotional money like high hands bonuses and proceeds from a weekly free-roll tournament they run if you play at least ten hours that week). I know from other forums that some people think that beating $1/2 live at that rate is impossible; I don’t really want to have that debate. All I can say is that if you’re a good player, come to the casinos of Oklahoma and try it. It’s what I make

**Table selection is important** As a regular, and who the uber-nits are. You are losing money if you’re not keeping an eye on the players in the room and actively seeking transfers to more profitable tables. A couple of my biggest benefactors called me out on this recently, as I moved (once again) to their table from another. I just said, “I like to be where the action is! You guys make it fun!” They laughed, “Well, there does always seem to be a lot of money on the tables we’re at.” (I left out the part about them funding my kids’ college savings.)
 
**Casino selection and promotional selection are important** If you live near more than one casino, whereas the casino thirty minutes in the other direction is mostly “good ol’ boys” (think Doyle Brunson look, but not skill). I’ve tailored my play schedule around when the juiciest games are and when the casinos offer the best promotions. The closest poker room offers a high hand bonus every hour after 2 am, whereas another casino offers a high hand bonus every thirty minutes between noon and midnight. In each case, I can add $7-$12 an hour to my winrate by playing when high hand is running (depending, obviously, on how many players are there. Very often there is only a single table running after 4 am, I also decrease the variance of high hand bonuses by agreeing to split them with other willing players at the table. I’ve also shown a decent profit from buying the high hands from people for less than they’re worth — I think I’ve gotten pretty good at estimating the likelihood of a hand holding up. Usually people will take much less than what the actuarial value would be. I’ve even bought hands like QQQTT with ten minutes left and only one table running for $60. People are really phobic about their hand getting beaten.) One other note about promotions like this: You don’t have to win any money directly from the promotion to benefit. If a fish wins the bonus

**Time away from the table is crucial** I know I’m just repeating what people have said on other forums, watching training videos, and discussing interesting spots with poker friends. You should also be active and stay healthy. When I feel better, I play better.

**Friendship is precarious** I see the same players over and over again, but you can’t lose sight of the fact that, if they are at the table with you, your goal is to take their money. Every last dollar. 

**Never loan money to people you only know through poker** I know you guys are thinking, but I made the mistake of making several loans and it did not end well.

**NEW ADDITION Treating players well** If you're playing the same player pool a lot, but it goes beyond that. When I started playing full-time, I didn't realize how much I came off as cocky know-it-all. I sometimes evaluated other players at the table and, embarrassingly, sometimes even berated their play. I am still working on being affable at the table and being a good sport, but several players have commented that they have noticed a change. You're going to upset people when you take their money; don't make it worse by being a dick. Remember that most players are there to have a good time. Do whatever you can to make their experience enjoyable. (Thanks to fackingcanuck for reminding me to add this.)

That’s it for now. I welcome any questions about playing low stakes cash games for a modest living and look forward to your comments.

**EDIT** Upon rereading some of my comments, just be a little more cautious about entering pots against him. You'll have plenty of opportunities against the weaker players. Sure, you'll go back-and-forth a little, but you won't win any serious long-term money from other winning players.",,False,,True,t3_fpwmy

.

Driving across the border is a nightmare, and simply walk across the border to Mexico. We park, I throw my $16K and all of the contents of my wallet, except one credit card, a few hundred bucks, and my ID, into the trunk of Tim's car, and we walk to the border. On the other side of the turnstile gate, welcoming me into Mexico and reminding me that I will be charged an arm and a leg if I wish to make any calls while in Mexico. A small chip in my phone

Just the other side of the guards, and there's no meter running, but he does recognize and know where the Hong Kong Club is, and $10 USD seems to satisfy him for payment to get there. The two main strip clubs in Tijuana are the Hong Kong Club and Adelita's Bar. They lie in about a 2 square block area that is a “safe zone” for tourists, and cops are all around to make sure that nobody ruins city's trade business. There's also food vendors with carts everywhere, so cheap authentic Mexican food is available any time.

We walk into the Hong Kong Club. There are restaurant-style benches with tables filled with guys and bikini-laden girls. We head to the back and to the right, and we have a cultural assumption that it's for broken girls and human trafficking and just all kinds of badness. But in Tijuana, it's just their job, they're happy to be making the kind of money that drunk Americans give them, and they are grateful for the business. They are happy to make men happy. It's a fair trade, an honest business, and they welcome the customers. It's just not sleazey and degrading like I had originally assumed it would be on my first trip to Tijuana. And best of all, thin, rubbing our backs and legs with their hands as we walk by, before we signal him over again and ask him to find us some company.

He brings over what must have been the three most beautiful girls in the place. It is “suggested” that we order the girls a beer—they get an affiliate's cut from the bar whenever we order them drinks—and we are happy to do so. One girl comes and sits on my lap, and uses her free hand to caress my leg and occasionally gently squeeze on my crotch. It's very pleasant.

I use my amazing high school Spanish skills and ask my girl for a “bailar” and she does an amazing lap dance. After a few minutes and another beer, and she seems to agree. She takes my hand and leads me out the front door of the club, one yard to the left, and into a doorway with a staircase that leads up to the reception desk of the hotel. I give the guy $30 for the half hour—although they offer a full day for $45—and he gives me a key, and we find our way to the room.

It's a quaint little room, with a few minutes left at the end for a very quick shower, so I can get back in my clothes reasonably clean. I give her $100 and imply as best I can that she keep the extra, and she seems exceedingly grateful about this. She grabs three $1 bills from her purse and gives them to me and points at the guys standing in the hallway waiting for us to finish so they can clean them room, and she says “this, but not more”. I guess the room-cleaners of Tijuana are making too much these days. She then smiles at me and gives me a kiss on the cheek before leaving and I finish dressing, and leave a minute or two later, and returning the key to the front desk.

I meet Tim downstairs and we grab some food at a sidewalk vendor and chat for a while, a main drag in Tijuana, not at the clubs but still reasonably safe. As we walk towards Hotel Tijúan, J.J. still cracking up uncontrollably tells us that he managed to get his girl to give him head while sitting on the toilet seat, and basically tricked her into fulfilling his fantasy of a perfectly-timed climax blumpkin. The girl he was with was surprised and NOT happy about this. We might be permanently barred from the Hong Kong Club, I'm not sure. We do decide though that this is a hopping town with lots of music and partying in the street, so even though we got laid, partying and potentially getting more girls. Hotel Tijúan is a much more upscale place, and it's really nice. I decide that if we're staying the night in Tijuana

On the way out the door, and once again, I haven't slept in two days, having spent the previous night in the Ocean's 10-20. Tim and J.J. go off looking for music and fun, and I go looking for a genuine massage parlor that gives actual massages. It takes a lot of mis-communication and confusion to tell the ladies running the parlors that I want an actual massage as opposed to a happy ending “massage”, and in the end, I never do find a place for a real massage. I'm also fairly tired and worn out, the pain in my back

As I get to my room, and find an English sitcom on one of the channels, and just veg out, relaxing my body and mind, and trying to just generally recover and rejuvenate from the stress of the past few days. I drift off a little bit but then get a spurt of energy as my back spasms a little bit. I decide to start running the water for the hot tub, so I can run the jets on my back. It goes very slow and it looks like it might take an hour or more, so I pull out my laptop from my backpack, and boot up. The hotel, I securely start surfing the web. I know it's pretty geeky to be in Tijuana and surfing the web on my computer

Before the hot tub had filled up, Hotel Tijúan fills to capacity weekend nights, and Tim and J.J. had found a few gorgeous girls on the street who would be their companions for the whole night for a few hundred bucks and he wanted my nice place with the hot tub for a few hours instead of the sleazier hotels by the clubs. He could tell I really didn't want to oblige but he insisted, and I didn't want to ruin his trip, and I guess I also felt like he had a point, because I really wasn't utilizing the room to it's full potential.

I put away my computer and grabbed my backpack and head towards the only other place in Tijuana I know of, and stressed and I just want to sleep. I go up stairs to the by-the-hour hotel and just pay the $45 for a night, just so I have a goddamned bed to sleep in. I try not to imagine the plethora of sex and fluids that the bed has seen as I doze off.

Not more than a few hours later, still having not gotten more than a few hours of sleep over the past few days. My head hurts, my back hurts, I'm tired, and I can't sleep. I also see through side of the blinds a girl leading a guy into a room across the hallways, and I remember where I am.

.

Since my time after college, I've gone from a liberal democrat to a civil libertarian-bordering-on-anarchist. Not being able to find a job, watching the housing crisis happen, seeing how inefficient politics is, watching the wars drone on and on, seeing criminal bankers not be jailed and politicians be bought—basically I've been growing more and more cynical about the world as each day goes by. My mom kicked me out—or at least I felt like she had—and the whole world was fucking broken and getting worse. Everything I had been told and believed in, all the people and family I trusted

I had known Tim for years—he was and still is one of my closest friends. He and his wife have an open relationship

I mention these things because it all came crashing down on me at two in the morning in Jizz Motel in Tijuana when I woke up, but I couldn't trust my friends and teammates, and now I couldn't even trust my closest friend, who by the way was sleeping around when he had a beautiful wife. Everything I knew about how the world worked was in shambles. I was alone in the world. Everything and every one I cared about or trusted had let me down and abandoned me. I was in great physical pain, very tired, and now psychologically, the whole world came crashing down as I lie in the bed of this hooker motel.

I snapped. What was I doing here? What was I doing with my life? What the fuck was going on!? How did this happen? This isn't me. I was really freaking out. All I wanted in the world was to be back home in Las Vegas in bed. I started crying. After a few minutes, so it's not like they could charge me for it. I hopped in a cab and told him to take me to Hotel Tijúan, and I scribbled a letter to Tim saying I was leaving and going back to Vegas, and I told them it was very important that the guy in my room get this letter. Even though I was very upset, I still didn't want them freaking out wondering where I was. I then took the cab to the border, and waited at the line back into the States with a bunch of kids from UCSD. I gave my ID to the border agent, and he told me I should really bring my passport next time, I found a cab who would take my credit card

Once there, so I went back on the wifi and used [my VPN setup](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/15eihx/7trxmk6zs_guide_to_getting_on_stars_in_the_usa/) to play on Stars for an hour before the flight started boarding. Before getting on the plane, I thought to call Tim's cell and leave him a message, just in case the hotel didn't get to him. He had a GSM phone and a SIM card for Mexico, and his Google Voice forwarded to all his numbers, so I knew he'd get the message. I boarded the plane and back in Vegas, took a cab back to my apartment. I knew my stuff was safe in Tim's car

But I still couldn't manage to sleep. For hours, angry, tired, thinking about the world and about my life. I would have killed myself at that point if I'd had a weapon. I didn't, and the effort of leaving my home and going out to get one was more trouble than it was worth, being as tired and in as much pain as I was.

Originally it was just going to be a comment in that thread


**6 Reasons Professional Poker Is Way Easier Than It Looks**

** *1. (Almost) Everyone thinks they're good at poker* **

But they're not. Very few people are actually skilled at poker, bluff well, and be generally cunning. This is good for you, the guy who actually *is* good at poker. In the long run, the fish have no chance.

** *2. People like to gamble* **

Even players who understand some of the basics of poker strategy and math often like to gamble. They are sometimes willing to get money in knowing they are a statistical underdog, you *will* win money. It doesn't take a tremendous amount of discipline to refuse to get money in when you know (or reasonably expect) that you are not getting the proper odds to be in the pot. This discipline is not fun, it's not sexy, and it won't impress the hot cocktail waitress. But it will make you gobs of money, and you'll attract a girl way better than that slutty cocktail waitress anyway when your fat stacks are falling out of your pocket on your way out of the casino.

** *3. People are emotional* **

Everyone is prone to tilt. Even you, and they often make very expensive mistakes when they are tilting. As an observant player, you notice when players are on tilt, and which players are most prone to tilt badly. When the signs of tilt show, you know it's worth getting into pots you otherwise would not, because the potential payoff has just risen. You know you must strike when the iron is hot, and the smoke coming out of seat 3's ears suggests the time is now. And you'll make money off of other emotions, too -- she's *fearful*, but she's never calling a big bet here. Professional players take advantage of these emotions

** *4. Most players are way too lazy or stupid to read books and articles

There's a reason that chess is not more mainstream in the US. It's *hard* to be good. *Really, but, somewhat ironically, some of its most avid fans don't realize how hard it is. They don't realize just how deep the rabbit hole goes, how many aspects of the game they could be thinking through. They certainly don't realize how many leaks they have, and how many opportunities they are missing. One of the reasons is that most players don't work on their game. They don't think through tough spots postmortem; they don't read books or watch training videos; they don't talk about hands with good players (well, they do talk about hands, books

** *5. As poker has grown

First, gangsters, and cowboys. They were the days when poker was ""dirty"". It was underground, and you almost certainly had a cigar collection if you played. Now poker players get a spot on Letterman, right after Drew Brees and before Katy Perry. Grannies take a break from their slot machines to play; college frat boys take a break from studying to play. By opening up to the masses, poker has brought in a tremendous number of fish, and they collectively carry a tremendous amount of dead money. Sure, but the ratio of fish:sharks is very, and the most accomplished pros enjoy the challenge of facing one another

** *6. The lifestyle is as good as it gets* **

There are not a lot of jobs that are completely free from deadlines, a dress code, or required working hours. As far as I can tell, playing poker offers more freedom than any other job. Not only are poker pros free from bosses, clients, and a set schedule, they can work anywhere a game is running. When I took my wife on a cruise a few months ago, and she had several spa treatments planned, we will be able to drop the ""almost""). I can work whenever I want

###General Advice

* I would not deposit more money than you can afford to lose in the event these sites get shut down and they pull a Full Tilt. Until all aspects of online poker are legalized in the US

* Each ""Network"" has a bunch of different ""skins"" which are interfaces, each skin can offer different promotions/rakeback deals, so research to make sure you maximize your bonsuses and rakeback before signing up for any site.

* But which one has the most fish? There are crappy players everywhere you go. I don't believe that anybody can make a blanket statement that one of these sites has more fish than any other. At the micros

* All of these sites appear to have really strong customer service except maybe Cake.

* Here is a continuing [2+2 thread](http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/28/internet-poker/where-can-us-players-play-1021260/) on where US players can play online. Go to around post 90 for more recent conversation.

* Here is the [2+2 subforum](http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/28/internet-poker/) for discussion of internet poker sites. If you have a specific question

* View [traffic stats](http://www.pokerscout.com/) of the sites.

###Options

* **[Bodog.](http://www.bodog.eu/)** Probably the fastest cash outs of all the sites. Customer service is quite good. They use a point system which is pretty bad compared to a straight rakeback deal. Some folks don't like the interface and your hand histories are not automatically saved, and IMO, are the most trustworthy of the current crop of sites. [Reddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/iyqmu/worth_it_to_play_on_bodog_us_player/) on Bodog.

* **[Everleaf Network](http://www.everleafgaming.com/)** ([Minted](http://www.mintedpoker.com/index.php), but they're supposed to be coming out with new software within a few months. Traffic is low, but getting better.

* **[Yatahay Network](http://www.yatahay.com/).** ([True Poker](http://www.truepoker.eu/), but traffic is low

* **[Cake Poker.](http://cakepoker.eu/en/Default.aspx)** ([Intertops](http://poker.intertops.eu/en/)). This site has had some controversy in the past [\(2+2 thread\)](http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/28/internet-poker/won-50000-60000-off-guy-cake-poker-cakepoker-takes-my-funds-update-settled-1040155/). They apparently settled the issue recently, a lot of like it, but as of late, cashouts have been taking two months or more for some people. Rakeback is 33% paid weekly plus a points system. Here is a recent [thread on Cake](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/jpy84/im_considering_depositing_on_cake_poker_and_would/). I think there are better options available. Having said that, a lot of players are strongly supporting [Intertops](http://poker.intertops.eu/en/) which is now on the Cake Network, as they have a separate cashier which is offering cashouts within 1-2 weeks.

* **[Merge Network](http://www.mergegaming.com/).** ([RPM Poker](http://www.rpmpoker.com/), you might be getting only the equivalent of 15% once you've built up enough points. Traffic at night is regularly over 10,000 players. Once they come back, I would recommend depositing for the traffic alone.

* **Bitcoin sites.** ([BTC On Tilt](http://btcontilt.com)) I have no experience with this site

1375736819.0,1jrl2x,How to beat bad players,CardCounter0,80,31,92,"* Lots of Bad players always calling

Okay

Here is a very well expressed train of thought that comes up frequently:

&gt; I realize how its profitable if you can flop a straight or a flush or a set but top pair top kicker and big pocket pairs were not cutting it. Even if I sit around and wait on AA, AK, AQ, which is basically what i did. Im still an underdog because 5 or 6 players are going to be there on the flop. If youre hitting straights and flushes youre going to make thousands. If youre trying to win with TPTK youre going to lose in this game.

Okay

Flopping straights and flushes and sets is very profitable.  Good.  Against a full table of calling stations

How about the second sentence?

*Sit around and wait on AA, AK, AQ* -- Wait.  Stop.  AA KK QQ are never suited.  They can't flop any flushes.  You already realize that floping straights and flushes is the way to profits.  So why are you waiting for AA KK QQ?  They can't flop a straight or a flush.  They are top pair kinds of hands which you just said aren't cutting it!  Now AA KK QQ can flop sets - but so can JJ TT 99 88 77 66 55 44 33 and 22, so why are you just waiting on AA KK QQ?

Your other two hands you are waiting for?  AK and AQ?  Well

And now the third and fourth sentences:

&gt; If youre hitting straights and flushes youre going to make thousands. If youre trying to win with TPTK youre going to lose in this game.

Yes

So the whole key to beating a bunch of bad players who are playing every hand and seeing every flop no matter what?  I think the key is contained in the second sentence.  

&gt; Even if I sit around and wait on AA, AK, AQ, which is basically what i did.

Can you figure it out?

I experienced this twice over the past week.  You are playing late at night and the games have consolidated into 2 tables (or there is 1 main game and a 1 ""must move"" table running).  The game you are at is getting short while the other table is full (rooms won't try to balance tables because in the confusion of musical chairs they usually wind up breaking both games).

Your table gets to 6 handed, so of course the game breaks.  At the very same time, 1 or 2 seats open up at the other game, so the floor comes over and usually you draw cards or something to see who gets the open seats and what order the remaining players go on the list to wait.

Okay, and was the cause of the game breaking?  He wins the draw and gets the seat.  So you have 4 people who were perfectly willing to continue to play 6-handed sitting around waiting, while the guy responsible for breaking the game, is happily playing at the full table.  WTF!

When the first guy quits and breaks the short game -- he should automatically go to the bottom of the list.  Then the remaining 5 players should draw for the seats and positions on the list.  Yeah dude

This would also have the benefit of nobody wanting to be the first guy to quit and going to the bottom of the list,,False,,t5_2qhix,False,,True

1301347808.0,gdfni,"HELP!!!!! Made my first straight flush, almost got killed (literally killed, long read, need advice)",toolucky,9, I never had a straight flush ever before.

First, the only solution if you want to play poker, aside from underground/illegal casinos, is playing either at **the official casino** OR **at an indian reserve**. Yesterday, I chose the later, players on Sunday SUCK.

I was at a VERY aggressive/loose table and had to fold AK with a K 7 3 flop (6 people in the hand, a guy with KT called to the bitter end). You get the idea of how aggressive and loose people were, calling with all kinds of hands. However, people are so loose that I tripled in one hand (88 on a AK8o flop - someone had Ax, someone had two pairs).

Finally I am sitting on the BB with [7](/hearts) [5](/hearts). Blinds are 1/2. Normally a easy fold hand

UTG has around $500 and is a HUUUUUGEEEE fish. ATM machine. How he made it so high

MP+1 is very tight

SB is very loose and fishy

Flops comes [4](/hearts)[Q](/hearts)[6](/hearts). I first notice I flopped a flush, UTG bets $15 in a $44 pot, MP+1 fold, SB fold, I call.

Turn comes [4](/hearts)[Q](/hearts)[6](/hearts)[K](/spades). Crap, I feel comfortable calling low bets.

I check

River is a BOMB.

[4](/hearts)[Q](/hearts)[6](/hearts)[K](/spades)[8](/hearts).

And here is the kicker... 

I do a simili-blocking bet of $45 in a $144 pot. Immediately he raises me to $115. I think for a while and decide to raise to $255. He thinks for a while and immediately goes all-in and I insta-call.

He laughs and says: ""Sorry

And now he's really pissed. Like, man"".

""HE CALLED MY RAISE PREFLOP WITH 57s! WHAT A FISH! 57!!!! He called with that!!! SEVEN HIGH!""

I just don't say a word. He then says: ""I'm going to get my money back one way or another is that fucking clear?"" and leaves the table.

I keep playing for a while, $945. It has been an hour since he left and he's sitting at the bar. Alcohol is free in Indian casinos. He's looking RIGHT at me. ALL this time. 

But what do I fear? He doesn't know who I am and he doesn't know which car is mine, my play starts to suck; I drop to $810, I get one big hand, get back over $900 and feel ready to leave.  

I go to cash out and he's just looking at me. I have no idea what to do. As I'm standing to the cashier he's like ONE FOOT behind me. As the cashier counts the money, drunk guy is going to attack me as soon as I leave the premises. 

I don't know what to do. I stand at the bar, I train four times a week and I don't know what to do. I just wait at the bar and drink a bit, checking my stuff closely.

I go to the bathroom and he follows me

ME: You got a problem man?

HIM: Nooooo I don't

ME: Stop following me. I'm not kidding.

HIM: I'm not following you man. 

ME: You are and that is making me uncomfortable. Please stop.

HIM: Let's play heads-up. You and I. $1

I am *this* close to accept but I'm too tired, I'll lose (if I lose, I lose, if I win, he's more angry). I start to think of the possibilities. I could make a run for it to my car and I could possibly get away, but couldn't he note my license number? I could call the police, I don't know what they would do in the indian reserve. I decide to go see another agent. He says he will hold the guy and that I have five minutes to leave. I thank him and go outside.

I'm about halfway to my car and the guy is running outside.

I should say

And he's coming at me, so I yell:

""YOU GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME OR I WILL FUCKING KILL YOU.""

He stops moving and says: ""Got a lucky night

I'm angry because it is so late and because of this stupid bullshit. I don't start a fight when I lose a hand.

""It was fucking poker. It was a fucking straight flush. IT HAPPENS

I don't even realize how tensed I am. I am taller and probably stronger than him since he is so drunk. He put one hand in his pocket and now I have enough, he yells back at them. They take him back inside. One of them talks to me, he's obviously some kind of boss, and I explain what happened. He apologize and say he will call the police, and I'm allowed to leave, finally.

I run into my car, my hands are shaking and I speed away from there, probably never to come back. As I am speeding on the highway, I'm scared that he is following me so I am really speeding hard. 

Finally I get home

**Questions:**

What could I have done? How do you deal with that kind of situation? How do you avoid them? 

Was I all a pussy? Should I have ""played this"" more aggressively? I believe I did everything I could but for the timebeing

Thanks for any help.

**TLDR**: Straight flush beat his Ace-high flush

I am actually so sickened by this, €5 buy in winner take all, Sometimes bigger if we feel like it, Everyone who plays knows each other very personally, We were friends long before we began playing poker together. We've been playing this regular game for about 8 months now. It's been super fun - Until 2 nights ago. 

I noticed in one of the games where just 3 of us were playing that one of the people who plays most regularly (Lets call him ""That dirty fucking cheating shitstain, with the deck face up, I didn't think much of it, Because fuck, Why would anyone cheat against friends? So the cheater deals, long story short he beats me with 2 pair A10 where I had A7, Didn't think much of it, As odd as this seemed I put it down to complete randomness and carried on. 

But then I finally saw it, I just kept playing and kept watching him do it. I mean, What in the fuck? Why was this guy cheating in the friendliest game of cards you could ever find - Between friends no less? 

So we finish the game, So we said we'd just watch him carefully next game.2 days later the next game comes, This time there's 6 of us, The cheater deals twice and no bottom dealing (Everyone at the table bar the cheater knows at this stage that I have seen him cheat), The 3rd time though, He does it, My friend who was playing the previous game and who I told first about what I saw immediately called him on it. 

The cheater sits there like a deer in headlights, But he knows, we know, and now reddit knows he was bottom dealing. So he just flat out denies it, We can't really do much other than tell him *we all just fucking saw him do it*, so we play out the rest of the hand (the most awkward hand of poker i've ever played by the way), Pretty much everyone folds, It's AQs

So he leaves the table and we haven't heard from him since. It was just fucking sickening

I topped off in 2008 winning close to half a million dollars and did very well in recent years never winning less than 6 figures.  I've grinded mostly cash games and dabbled in tournaments online and live.  

I've won as much as $250k in a single day and have lost 5 figures many times.  I play everything, and mix games.  Yet through it all I think I maintained a very stable life for my family and myself (which is rare in this industry).

I've written articles for various poker magazines and online sites such as Cardplayer

My two biggest accomplishments in poker are winning more money than the previous year 10 years straight ('98 to '08) and providing a nice life for my family and myself. I'm here to answer any questions and share my experiences and wisdom on what it takes to succeed in poker over the long run.

We'd got to the point where a couple of the players had only 10-15 big blinds left, and exclaimed to the table that if they wanted to play this hand 'it would cost them one hundred thousand chips!' because there was no way he was folding to any sort of raise with his short stack. As we were on the bubble at this point (top 6 get paid) it was clear he was hoping to pressure the table into giving him a walk.
He confidently looked each player in the eye as they passed their hands, not a reg at the casino. The big blind looked at him, repeating his warning: ''It's gonna cost you all these chips, son''.
 The Irishman looked down at both of his cards and without hesitation looked back towards the big blind and said ''Wrong. It's gonna cost YOU all those chips
 The loud guy on the big blind looked shocked and gingerly passed his cards into the muck. 
 The Irishman flipped up the deuce of clubs and took in the pot with a crooked smile on his face.
 I think it was the most epic thing I've ever seen on the poker table.

",20,92,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/sgew7/pocket_queens_preflop_a_guide_to_level_2_thinking/,"Okay, many in r/Poker will know that this is an ""obvious"" spot.  However, /r/Poker has a lot of people coming in who are beginners.  

I played this hand in a live mixed game last Monday and I wanted to illustrate a concept for the new players - Level 2 thinking. 

When you see a poker movie, some players are so good at live tells that it can be uncanny.  Look at Daniel Negreanu playing heads up against amateurs on Million Dollar Challenge, for example.  

And ""tells"" do exist - shaking hands could mean a monster... or Parkinsons.  Legs wrapped around the chair legs could mean weakness - or it could mean the legs need a stretch.  

But for the most part

There are many levels of poker thinking

Level 0: ""I am not thinking about what I have."" 

Level 1: ""I am thinking about what I have.""

Level 2: ""I am thinking about what my opponent holds.""

Level 2 thinking is the biggest quantum leap that a new player can make.  It's the point where you stop ""playing cards"" and start ""playing poker.""  And Level 2 thinking can get you through *most* poker games against beginners with a positive balance. 

Here is an example of Level 2 thinking.

I'm playing in a mixed game

I'm sitting in the small blind with 9 players. We are all very deep stacked

The under the gun player limps (that is

The button (who I know little about but don't think he's been getting out of line) raises to $8.50.  This is a raise of 17 BB - and about twice what is currently in the pot.  The rule of thumb in many cases is to bet 3-5x the BB + 1 BB for every limper.  The button has now bet 9x the BB + 1 for every limper.  This is a very large raise compared to the size of the pot and the action before the flop.  

I now look at my cards

QQ is a solid hand, AA and KK.  

I look at the raise by the Button, suited king-small, suited connectors, small pocket pairs - these are all hands that would want to raise, but keep the pot small.  I can eliminate these hands from his range.  He likely has two big cards - KQ, AJ+ or ATs+, or a medium-to-big pocket pair - TT+. 

Against that range

True to form, but my hand is very strong - QQ is a monster preflop.  

However

With a high pocket pair in holdem, because a 4-bet range is much stronger than a raise's range.  What would the button do this with?  I can't see him doing this with TT or even JJ.  I can't see him doing this with AQ.  *Maybe* AQs... So that leaves AA, KK, and AK.  Against that range, I'm am either a small favorite (56% against AK) or a huge underdog (18% vs KK+).  

I decide to fold.  I'm not ""beating his range"" and he has made his 4-bet big enough that I can't afford to try to set-mine with queens.  

Level 1 thinking would have shoved. But thinking at level 2

Now, and my 3-bet range, from the small blind, was probably TT+, AQs.  Because of the limpers, I don't think the button was putting me on a re-steal, as a steal probably wouldn't work against a field of limpers. So whatever he had can crush such a range - something like AQ/AJ would have probably seen the flop and tried to spike an ace. TT and JJ might call to set-mine. I myself would probably have flat called with AK or JJ in that spot. (in tournaments, but in cash-games... but that's another topic for another day.) 

And it's true that he could be ""turning his hand into a bluff"" with something like AQs or JJ - a hand he now knows is beat, and I'm not folding there near often enough for that to be profitable for him.  

But level 2 thinking was enough to get me to fold my queens here.

So 3 days ago, I decided to play a freeroll.  There were over 4000 entries.  I have played in these a lot on merge (used to be almost everyday), and the furthest I ever got was the lowest payout (I think a 2.20 ticket).  I got third place!  The prize:  $9 in cash and an $11 ticket.  I promptly blew the $9 in the blackjack game on there (I know, I know, you don't have to tell me how stupid that is).

Then, so I saw that there was a $11 satellite to the daily ""high roller"" $200+$15 tourney.  It was in late reg, but I still got in.  They payed about 9 spots, only the top 6 getting a $215 ticket.  I won second place (after 7th went out it was an all in fest anyways, with nothing more to gain).  I do have an interesting question about a play I made near the 7th place ""bubble"", but don't have time to post it right now.

Edit:  I made a [separate thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/nkl0i/satellite_tourney_bubble_playetiquette_question/) to discuss that hand.

I decided against playing the ""high roller"" that was playing that night.  I was tired, and puts me in the black for the year!  I can't fucking believe it!  I always hear those ""make a freeroll into a ton of money challenges/stories, and think they're impossible/bullshit, but I did it!

8-handed table

BTN: $???

SB: $???

**Hero (BB): $15.65**

UTG: $???

**UTG+1: $13.85 TAG**

**MP1: ~$35.00 LAG**

MP2: $???

**CO: $26.20**

Pre-flop
UTG Folds, MP2 folds, CO raises to $.60, Button calls, SB Folds, Hero calls, UTG+1 calls

Flop: [](/Ah) [](/Kh) [](/6h) (5 players)
Hero raises $1, CO raises to $10, BTN folds, Hero **???**

My thoughts: It's pretty easy to see that, which would definitely wind up going into the pot by the end. I've got the nut flush draw with two cards to go, and I can see that the TAG in UTG+1 has his mind set on going all-in anyway 

UTG+1 wouldn't be in the hand at all if he didn't have a middle pair or a decent ace in his hand. He would have definitely raised early on with any pair tens or above, but I don't think the sixes are likely. Either way, he's got me beat now, but loses to a flush, and he doesn't have a heart in his hand.) 

MP1 could have almost anything

The CO only raises to $10 if he's trying to discourage a flush draw. If he was on a flush draw, but if it's the Ace, he only bets into this pot with a high heart or a King as his other card. A(?) [J](/hearts) is the absolute bottom of his range here, but I don't see him making a weak raise in position pre-flop with any combination of the remaining hearts, and I don't see him trying to discourage flush draws if he's already got the flush with any of the hands he would have initially raised with. I figure his range is pretty close to 66, KK, AK

So the way I see it, and most of the cards that would pair the board at this point to make a boat are already in someone's hand. I could fold right now knowing that I'm beat, or I could shove and hope to quadruple up to be the big stack. What would you do in this situation?

I can post results later on if anyone's interested.

**Edit:** So for the results: Every other night, but the next day was Easter, and we hadn't done our eggs yet, so I felt kind of guilty leaving my wife to the task, so losing wasn't a big concern for me. I shoved and got three callers. UTG+1 showed AK for two pair, MP1 had the flush with [10](/hearts) [3](/hearts), and the CO showed KK for the set. The turn and river were blanks,,True,t3_rzon9

TALKING POINTS:

As recently reported by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement

According to a 2010 study by Econsult

The bill will directly increase Atlantic City’s revenue stream by requiring that all online gaming operators be restricted to land-based casinos in Atlantic City and casino operators would be required to obtain an online license (renewable on an annual basis) from regulators.

New Jersey is uniquely positioned to lead this innovative new industry and help run the operations for other states that will want to adopt similar structures moving forward.

Regardless of the player’s location within the state

The bill allows for both interstate compacts and taking play from players in other countries as long as the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement determines that such wagering is not inconsistent with federal law.

1346907671.0,zfot9,Poker is Logic: preflop raise sizing and ranges,PokerIsLogic,38,6,18,"**Introduction:**

I like poker. I have no credentials and grind microstakes when i have spare time. I write these guides when I hit a few coolers in poker and have nothing better to do. Still reading? Cool.

The general gist of poker guides for beginners is pretty standard ""raise large with a tight range

Instead of giving you a set guide of hand ranges and raise sizing for specific opponents


**Why raise?**

So you've probably heard from many many poker guides that raising preflop is the bomb. 
It is the bomb. The blinds represent players raising with a 100% preflop range. We make money off our opponents mistakes. It is almost never a mistake to check with 27o on the BB. Therefore we are not making money. 


But you can find the fundamental reasons for raising anywhere:
1. get value from weaker hands(&lt;50% equity against you)
2. get hands with equity against you to fold (this still counts for hands that have less than 50% equity against you)
3. deception (a lot less relevant in microstakes since your opponents are probably half drunk and therefore not trying to read you).

So when we raise preflop we are generally looking to either get value from weaker hands or just pick up the blinds. 


In truth


**Preflop raise sizing and ranges based on preflop stats:**

Okay, not only does he know your range is wide (say 30%) but he also knows that the top portion of your range is taken off (now he's looking at a 15-30%). This is bad, this is the worst, you don't want this.

There are many ways to solve this. One is to polarise your preflop raise sizes (bet 5BB with your AA, 67s, 22   and bet 3BB with KJ, KQ, JT etc.). 
What I like to do is just imagine the range i'm going to be playing in this situation and bet accordingly (i have super nits behind me that only see 10% of flops

So how much do we raise?
Standard posts will tell you 4BB+1 for every limper (works very well 9 handed microstakes).

The correct answer is dependent on how much your opponents are willing got call.
Are your opponents willing to call 10BB with a 50% range? then you can profitably raise 10BB with a 25% range (1 opponent for simplicity)
Are your opponents willing to call 2.5BB with a 20% range? then you can profitably raise 2.5BB with a 100% range.

Obviously you also have to factor in their 3bet frequency etc. (prettty much if they start 3betting a lot just tighten up your range).  But this is the main idea. 
They call too much? Raise a tight range large. They fold too much? Raise a wide range small. 
They play weird ranges in between and 3bet weirdly? you work it out and if you can't either leave the table or just limit yourself to playing Aces against them.

The idea that you should have a standard raise size that you stick to forever is a very bad notion and will move you away from the logical thought processes needed in poker. How much should I raise and what should I raise? The answer is entirely player dependent and should vary substantially depending on the table dynamic. 



**Impact of Postflop Stats:**

First thing's first. Are you scared of playing your opponent(s) postflop? Leave the table and find an easier one. Or if there's only 1 shark and many fish. Avoid the shark like the promotional burgers at McDonalds. 

So

So... what postflop stats should impact your preflop decisions. I'll give you the easy ones you can work the rest out from there.

- your opponent folds to 3/4 pot bets on the flop if they don't connect. You can profitably raise 100% of hands with a large raise size and cbet the flop. (obviously you ahve to limit your range against multiple opponents) (also changes if they have something like a 10% preflop calling range as they will hit like 60% of the time.)
- your opponent always calls the flop bet but gives up on the turn if they miss. You can raise (or in some cases just limp) 100% of hands with a small raise size (and then 2 barrel bluff them). 

In fact
Pretty much for more complex situations try to stick to a principle that if he folds too much you want a lot of smaller pots with a wider range and if he calls or bets too much you want bigger pots with a tighter range.

[Bitcoin](http://www.bitcoin.org/) is a distributed p2p currency that can be transferred from person to person with no record whatsoever. 

There would need to be an intermediate site that was hosted outside of the united states

A second option for the use of bitcoin is to build it into the p2p system that bitcoin already runs on. Basically it would be like when they shut down Napster and everyone when to bittorrent and emule.. Without a centralized server there is noone to arrest

You can buy bitcoins with paypal, etc..

I'm not sure how it would all work exactly

Bitcoin is already a pretty established currency..

I'm a programmer by trade and really want to take up this idea because the demise of online poker is going to hurt one of my favorite things to do.

There is a ridiculous amount of pump-fake braggadocio and bluffing bravado going on ATM regarding heads up challenges. I won't name names but everyone knows what's up. So, and get something rolling?

Simply put it's like this: Post your game here, when you're available and I'll set up an escrow. The person you call out can reply with ""accept"" or ""decline.""

Put your money where your mouth is and have your skill and luck tested or don't. Quite simple. No attempt to save face by pricing people out or pretending you had server issues. No bitching about game types. No excuses. Just accept

The escrow I'll set up will be a dealer at Harrah's who'll hold the money for a %. I'm thinking 5% under $1

Here's an example post - and a 100% legit challenge:

* **I challenge /u/MaxMidget to a heads-up poker match.**
* Glove to the face: You nipple-phallused scallawag,meanit
* Game type(s): 5Draw
* Challenge Structure: Each game for set stakes
* Stakes: Let's keep it small
* Game structure: $4, $5,000 in chips for 5Draw and no levels for the first two hours. After that blinds double every half hour. }:-D
* Caveat: Players must wear bow ties and panama hats. If you win a pot with a full house and the pocket cards [6](/hearts)[9](/hearts) you must sing at least one line from The Love Boat theme song. The winner must buy the loser a beer. During breaks and between hands it will be considered good form to talk about how people who say how great they are at poker and how poor other people are at it and claim to be poker players are complete loserdouchefagtwats if they won't even play a game of poker with the people they talk to about it.
**ESCROW TYPE:** We live in the same town and you know my bankroll. Let's have fun man. Put my money in your wedding fund so I don't have to buy you a present.

Obviously this is a fun challenge but it exists as a legit challenge and an example of how to do this. Gentlemen

* (link to paypal or escrow account screenshot
* I'm calling out /u/name or group of people (anyone over 21 / people who enjoy orange juice, anyone who plays on site XYZ...)
* Game type
* Challenge format
* Stakes
* Offer good until 99:99 EST
* Insults if you want to
* Caveats or special orders

So, and have a sidebar that notes that posts are legitimate offers of business and backing out forfeits the money to the person you challenged.

They THEY bet out, all because you took no initiative in the hand and did not give villain anything to respond to other than weakness.

Stop letting your fear induce passive lines that get you in trouble, more expensive spot after giving villain a chance to outdraw or otherwise leverage the hand away from you.

You will get yourself in a lot less trouble when you bet your flops, if you are beat, your villain will let you know sooner rather than later with a raise.

1345156401.0,ycf9d,Congratulations live poker. You've broken me (rant),SockBramson,64,30,120,"Remember online poker? Remember when you took a bad beat

If you were an MTT/SNG specialist online and live in a jerkwater town you can go fuck watermelons when it comes to playing the tournaments you love.

Today I hit my breaking point. After 10-cashless tournaments against what has to be the softest field of poker players imaginable I'm out. I just can't win.

Can anyone calculate the odds of losing all of these hands? You'll notice a progression.

**EXIT #1:** Move my short stack in from the button with 22. BB snaps me off with AKo.

22 = 52.75%
AK = 46.67%

Flop = K-K-Q

Lost a flip. Pretty standard stuff.

**EXIT #2:** Final table. Stack around 12k. Blinds 1k/2k. Folded to me in the SB. Look down at 66. Jam. BB snaps me off with AKs.

66 = 52.27%
AK = 47.27%

Flop = K-K-Q

Again. Pretty standard stuff. Losing two flips in a row isn't a big deal.

**EXIT #3:** Final table. Getting short. MP player limps and I jam AJs from the cutoff for about 7BB's. MP player calls with 33. Maybe after losing the first two with the small pair I'll win here and have a decent stack at the final table.

AJs = 49.37%
33 = 50.04%

Flop = J-T-3

Wtf. Let me win any of these 3 hands and I'm in the money and battling for a top 3.

**EXIT 4:** Final two tables. I have about an average stack with 10k. With blinds at 200/400 I make a raise UTG to 1050 with AA. Folded to the BB who has me covered and monkey jams

AA = 80.94%
JJ = 18.65%

Flop = 3-8-J

**EXIT #5:** Final two tables. Getting short around 6k at 200/400. UTG+1 raises to 1200. I look down at two red Aces and 3-bet to 2550. Guy at the table actually says out loud

AA = 81.26%
QJdd = 18.30%

Flop = [8](/diamonds) [T](/diamonds) [J](/spades)

WTF.

AA = 46.26%
QJs = 52.83%

Turn = [9](/diamonds)

Drawing dead.

One guy at the table shouts at the guy ""YOU ARE A FUCKING IDIOT!"" At least that was funny. I just wish everyone good luck and leave.

**EXIT #6:** Final two tables. By this point I haven't won an all-in or any hand at showdown in more than two months. After stealing some blinds with shoves I have 8k with blinds at 400/800. UTG+1 is a big stack who raises to 2300.

I look down at [A](/clubs) [K](/clubs) and 3-bet shove.

Back on him he tanks but finally says

AKs = 66.86%
A2s = 26.65%

Flop = [4](/hearts) [6](/hearts) [2](/spades)

Come on man this isn't even fair.

Turn = [7](/hearts)

Drawing dead on the turn again.

**EXIT #7**

There were an unbelievable amount of idiots in attendance today. Saw a guy cold call a 4-bet for half his stack and then check/fold a flop saying ""Had sixes."" A guy I recognize as being particularly atrocious gets moved to my left.

Blinds are 200/400 I have 6k. UTG limps

Flop = 8-9-T.

Pot is 3100

He shows A9o

Really? How could anyone think they're good there or I'd fold. This guy is a regular. How could anyone with a brain make a play that bad?

KK = 77.27%
A9 = 19.70%

Turn = J

KK = 88.64%
A9 = 11.36%

River = A

I flew out of my seat. This is enough for me.

Seven tournaments without winning a showdown or an all-in. The worst shape I put myself in was a slight underdog?

I know in the grand scheme of things this shouldn't bother me. Like I said before

This is different. I'm driving 45 minutes to get it all-in against morons who just crush me with whatever garbage hands they can muster.

I also I know what I sound like a total asshole but believe me when I say I'm not and this is just frustration. I smile

But I'm just boiling.

It's like the ant the grasshopper.

The ant spent the summer storing up food for the winter while the grasshopper laid about doing whatever the fuck he wanted and getting drunk.

Then the winter came. The grasshopper was drunk out of his mind and starving for food. So he stumbled around and tripped over his own legs and fell right through a wall into the ants food storage place. He landed on the ant crushing his spine so the ant couldn't move. The ant could only lay there

1336596239.0,tfa9t,How I Stopped Tilting,7trXMk6Z,41,8,37,"I used to tilt.  A lot actually.  I still do sometimes

I didn't have a particular path, and it's still there (to a much smaller extent).

My previous coach insisted it was as easy as ""not accepting that from yourself

As far as I can tell these are all very valid reasons and all in part true and helpful.

I think the fixing my life one was the most useful.

Poker is much less stressful if your life is good and you have enough money or outside income that the session really doesn't matter.  Grinding rent money at 25nl and 50nl was pretty stressful, with things so much better in life.

I can't say for sure what did it, I was finally able to feel the tilt creeping in, in the back of my mind.  The frustration, worry and panic, guilt, anger, all swirling around in the back of my head-- I could feel it coming on.  So the first thing I did was learn to sit out before it overtook me and my play.  The next thing I did was to see it coming on, and resolve to play 1 more orbit of solid tilt-free play and THEN sit out.  Then 2 orbits.  Then eventually I could still feel it sitting there in the back of my mind

So I realized that I was still not playing my best, the kind of stuff that's useful when you are playing well), and hoped that my rote technical skill would be enough so that even my soft-tilt game would be a solid winner.  This actually worked reasonably well, and I think my technical skills at NLHE are very very good.

But then a few years ago, get out and be more sociable, etc.  The standard things people work on when they're pumped up.  I haven't fixed all of it to a satisfactory level yet, but I'm working on it, and I'm reasonably proud of my self and my life and my person.  And for the past year or so, my poker has been really really good.  And virtually tilt-free, even of that ""soft"" tilt.  And only recently did I realize why-- it's all the reasons that people were initially telling me

I know for a fact that I'm by far the best player at every table I sit at

Even though the money does mean something, and a few useful vocational trades that will always be needed (like DEALING poker--the WSOP needs like 1000 dealers every summer)... in short, I will never be on the street, and the absolute worst that will happen is I work or deal or sleep on a friend's couch playing on borrowed money for a few months until I scrape up enough to grind 50nl online or 1-2 live again.

To be sure, I would immediately be finding other ways to get myself back into a better situation-- but it IS there, it IS available, it IS me making my OWN way in life, and I did it for YEARS early on, so it's not like I'm above it or something.  I know I can do it, I've done it before.

So the worst cas scenario is that I'm set back a few years in my life.  Doing what I did before.  It sucks

Not only am I above tilt, I really and truly DON'T care about the outcome of the hand.  It just doesn't matter.  At all.  If I lose every single hand I play, I'll be fine.  Now when I play, I truly feel transcended above the table.  Like the act of playing is weird experience now.  I remember when I started out, playing 1-2 at the MGM in Vegas, losing 2 buyins in a day was a disaster.  Like I couldn't imagine varience beyond that at all.

Nowadays I'm frequently in a game for 3-6 maximum buyins and ready to dig for more.  I'm often in a game for four buyins

If putting my stack in gives me a 1% edge, the right play is the right play, and as I said, I just don't care if I lose it.  With this attitude, I've taken more shots, played much higher and built my roll up very quickly, and now am firmly entrenched in mid and high stakes games.  But if I lose it all, and at the very worst

I just feel completely at peace with life and my poker and I know I can and will make the right play and I know I will always be fine in life.  That peace and knowledge I believe is what has helped me not tilt (or tilt very little).

I hope my story is helpful.  I don't really have specific advice

So, I tend to get little respect because I do bluff in good spots to do so, the woman to my right is on tilt and is particularly out to get me. 

Attempting to recall the hand from memory a few hours later

Mississippi straddle to $10 BTN. SB and BB complete. I make it $50 with JJ from UTG. 5-6 callers pre-flop (couple guys behind, BB villain, and us). 

Flop comes AJ8r. I cbet and get called by just the BB, and Ax is a huge % of her range. I jam into the ~$1000 pot. Now, we're actually $2250 effective behind, but I didn't realize she was quite this deep, she was on my immediate right and had a $500 chip and a couple $100 chips where I couldn't see them. I wanted a slight overbet to make it look bluffy, but this was actually bigger than I thought. 

In any case, she usually has a lot of class at the table, probably the tilt plus the alcohol. Just absolutely no class.

The win? I didn't tilt. Not even a little bit. Tap the table, I feel fine. It's a nice feeling that's subdued a bit by the big loss.

This weekend went to a casino that I hadn't played at for over year.  Friday night I managed to lose about $140

So I was right back there Saturday night

But back to how not to make money at a soft table:

A young hillbilly type guy with a strong country accent sat down at the table.  He started ordering beers two at time, and in loud drunk fashion announced ""He was just there to have a good time"" (sober translation: I want to lose all my money).

He went through about 2 buy-ins, and was making comments like ""I thought we were here to have fun, I ain't gonna play at a table if we ain't all having fun"".

I was cracking some jokes with the guy (and taking the large portion of his chips) and generally keeping everything light hearted.  I told him ""Don't pay attention to those old sour pusses

A little while later I excused myself from the table to take a smoke break, and for dropping the occasional f-bomb.

As I walked by the floor was saying, ""As long as he has a big pile of chips in front of him, you can bring him beers three at a time for all I care.  If you pick him up out of the game, then I'm going to be pissed."" and went for my smoke.

Drunk hillbilly went broke shortly after and managed to lose about $600 to the table

Why don't people like money?

**The Pair vs Pair Paradox**


Posted: 2005-12-07 09:20 



One of the most frustrating things in Hold 'Em is getting a good pocket pair



After a while it can seem odd. You don't get pairs that often



The odds you'll be dealt a pocket pair in Hold 'Em is once out of every 17 hands



Because you only see a pocket pair 5.8% of the time in your own hand, the odds that more than one player is dealt a pocket pair is 11.4%. 



So



The simple reason is that it happens more often than you think it should. Once you receive your cards and see a pocket pair



You read that right. The odds of more than one player on a ten-handed Hold 'Em table receiving a pocket pair is 11.4%. But when YOU see your pocket pair



This is what we call the Pair vs. Pair Paradox. Its not really a paradox



Lots of players who worry about a site dealing rigged hands typically complain that a site ""doesn't feel right."" As we've discussed



But the ""feeling"" that opponents too often have pairs the same time you do is wrong -- unless you ""feel"" that it should happen about 42% of the time -- typically far above what many would estimate. 



The REASON for this is that once you look down at your pocket pair



Think about it this way: 

What are the chances of you flipping a coin HEADS three times in a row? 

Simple answer: 50% * 50% * 50% = 12.5% 

What are the chances of you flipping a coin HEADS three times in a row after you've already flipped HEADS twice in a row? 

Simple answer: 100% * 100% * 50% = 50% 

The bottom line: When you have a pocket pair in Hold 'Em

**Part 1: First Week.**

As my last WSOP trip reports on TwoPlusTwo were so well received, Luke Haward, has kindly agreed to edit and write up my trip reports which I will be frantically scribbling in-between some sessions on the felt. My updates will contain analysis of the major hands I get involved in, stories about the players I meet on and off the felt, as well as my thought processes and feelings as I pit my energies and poker skills against huge fields of players live in Vegas in an effort to achieve my first six figure score and that compelling WSOP Gold Bracelet. 

For those of you who don't know me, I'll achieve my first Gold Bracelet and be able to call myself a World Series of Poker Champion! Thank you for reading and best of luck at the tables!

**May 30th (Day 1

I doubled up in the second hand of my first tourney, I raise to 300 from the BB, and he calls. The flop comes 2 2 7 twotone, I continue for just over half the pot, he raises to 750, I jam my stack in the middle and he snap calls it off with JJ and doesn't make his 2-outer to survive.

My day 1a table draw was full of randoms and very soft, a really nice guy from D.C. There were two dudes at the new table who obviously knew each other and were a lot of fun. Whenever we had a good looking female dealer they made a lot of jokes and were hitting on her and getting badly denied, it was pretty amusing. 

Melanie Weisner was then moved to our table

After a while she ended up having her AA cracked to bust in a fairly sick spot. By the time Melanie busted I had been chipping down for some time and was sitting on about 10 big blinds at 150-300. When the final level hit, busting an even shorter stack, and then winning another flip to get back up to 16,700 or 42 big blinds, and ended the night with that. Made day 2 with just above average stack and 30bbs to work with. 

**May 31st (Day 2

http://img703.imageshack.us/img703/4998/playingwithphelps.jpg

My starting table draw for Day 2 included none other than Michael Phelps! While I wasn't able to play with him long as he busted fairly quickly, from John the carpenter, to Michael the greatest swimmer to ever live. You never know who you're going to meet, or what may happen. 

Not long after Phelps busted, as I'll go on to explain. I was absolutely shocked to see him sitting in a 1k, having assumed he'd be crushing the big cash games running through the summer and only be playing the bigger buy-in events. It occurred to me that he might have some kind of bracelet bet running, but when I quizzed him on this he just told me he was in love with the very concept of the World Series, and just wanted to win another bracelet really badly, not really caring about the money. This commitment to playing for pure glory and for the game itself earns my respect far more than his ability alone. When you add the fact that he comes off as a genuinely good guy, you have the makings of highly entertaining table draw

The way that Scott got started in poker is less surprising once you've met him and realized what a mind he has. Scott told me a story about his college days at Brown University around 8 years ago, somewhat star struck at seeing such a prolific player at their school, he nonetheless plucked up the courage to start chatting with him. Not long after, Scott was also introduced and a group of them went out to dinner. 

Over their dinner discussion,000, who was at the time a broke college junior with less than $500 to his name. One of the first games Scott ever played on this stake was the Sunday Million on Party Poker, the first tourney with a $1 million guarantee to ever run on the site, and he managed to make his way to the final table for a score of around $35,000! The rest, as they say

I managed my best to stay afloat at the table that included Seiver. After we broke and I got moved to a new table I managed to build for a bit. I managed to peak at around 45k at 800-1600, and not long after busted in 103rd place (out of 3200 runners) for $2,900. 

Most people would be upset to run fairly deep in a WSOP event and not have much to show for it

Maybe it was a sign for what the series had in store for me…

**June 1st (Event 6)** 

I sat down for flight A of the $1.5k 'Millionaire Maker' with a tantalizing $1 million guaranteed for first place, including the fabulous Xuan Liu. While a fairly challenging table draw, it was a fun one, and I had the opportunity of hearing about the history of the games in L.A. and Vegas from a live pro who's played as high as the 100-200 nlhe/plo mix cash games.

I was busted in a totally standard spot, the world famous Yevgeniy Timoshenko (or JovialGent online), one of the best online MTT-ers as well as an extraordinary live player, Tony Cousineau, one of the top WSOP cashers of recent times, and Dan Suied, who goes by the nickname Miami Boss and is good friends with Darryl. There were in fact only two people at the table who I figured might not play full time

As you can imagine, and on nearby tables as well as on the rail, which included Jason Mercier. Our table was wild, hilarious and probably the most fun I have ever had at a poker table. I was literally blinded by tears of laughter multiple times. 

One of the funniest moments of the night was when we started playing the meta-game of 'show one card if you win a pot'. One of the main players in the hand was Miami

The hand that occurred Miami Boss opened in middle position for just over a min raise

After a few minutes of thinking and talking through it all aloud, as he made a really funny face and then snap covered his face with his hands and started giggling like a little kid. They were both fairly drunk at this point. Miami finally does fold, showing his hand to Darryll once again as he does so.

CC makes the case that the play is overall negative EV and the hand should be folded pre-flop. 

If your default strategy is to call, hitting two pair or trips shouldn't even be a consideration since it rarely happens.

I agree with CC on folding and the reasons are simple: (1) you don't have any fold equity and (2) the stack-to-pot ratio (SPR) is going to make your life a living hell on the flop. Let me explain

Villain raises 4bb, the SPR on the flop will be (100-4)/21.5, around 4.5. That's a horrible SPR for drawing hands. 

Suppose you flop a flush draw

The math looks good right? Wrong. You're forgetting the most important thing in poker: villain's range. 

Villain's cbet range is pretty wide (even really bad players are cbetting these days), he essentially shuts you out of the hand. 

Now many of you will say that (1) the other players in the hand will increase your I/O to a point where calling is +EV overall or (2) since villain's range is wide, there's a problem. 

The worst case scenario is your up against a bigger flush draw

Another thing to consider is that the other (3+) players won't let you get to the turn. Online games are really aggressive

I left some stuff out (ex: playing with 150bb+ stacks)

Fish at $1, and the other guy is super tired and says he's skipping a round. He never comes back.

What happens next is one of the hardest ""in-your-face"" heads-up match I ever played. I managed to steal nearly $13

1) Plays 100% of his hand. Yes

2) When he has a good hand, check, check. When he checks the flop I pretty much know he has something, else he ""bluffs"".

On the first second hand I clean him. He instantly rebuy. Cleaned in 15 mins. He asks the dealer if he can rebuy for more than 200BB and the dealer says no, dealer agrees. Fish buys for $2,000. To his credit, he actually make his straight on the turn. He goes allin. I had nuts set. I call, I make my full on the river.

He acts like he's about to stop. It's 3:30, ""I'm so unlucky !!!!"". 

I say I am going to sleep

About 30 mins I clean him again. He plays every hand worst than the hand before. I play tight (top 30% of hands) aggressive (with the semi-bluff call with hands such as 67s which IMO are too weak to call preflop headsup)Now he cries, and he loses it all again. I'm actually afraid to call his allin on the river with top two pair, but I win $2,000 again. Oh yeah, this guy has tons of tells too: when he pushes his chips excited, he made whatever he was hoping for. Once I flop a full on a flush draw board. I bet a bit, he calls. I bet the non-flush turn, he raises

He's crying and he can't stop. I am dying, then two guys go behind him and say it's time to sleep. And he screams "" I lost everything! I lost it all! I was so unlucky! every hand!""

This guy just threw his money away. Called an allin on the turn with a shitty flush draw. Called with two pairs. Called with K high on a 888JT board. This guy had no idea how to play.

My question: I actually feel pretty bad about it. I mean to me it was free money. Way for a good flop

Is it wrong? Should I... I don't know, imagine how you'd feel if you lost 16k. I mean, he has a problem and I feel like I took advantage of it.

1372311622.0,1h5uhc,Poker ABC's: Shove Math,Protential,29,3,13,"Whether or not a shove is going to be profitable preflop is dictated by a simple formula

**Note:** In many situations plays will be +CEV but be -$EV and thus in actuality be bad to do.

There is a simple formula used to figure out whether or not an open jam pre-flop is +CEV or not. That formula is: **Fold Equity (FE) + Called Equity (CE) = Hand Equity (HE)** 

Fold Equity (What we gain when everyone folds) = Chips in the pot x % Everyone Folds 

Called Equity (What we gain or lose when someone calls) = ((Hero's Stack + Blinds and antes x Hand Equity vs Avg Villain Calling Range) - (Hero's Stack x Villain's Avg Hand Equity))x % Hero Gets Called

While the formula above looks pretty complex in text form, it is worth learning/understanding)

Easiest way to explain it is to give an example from a real world hand. 

Lets say that we have [](/7s) [](/7d) UTG at a 9 handed table. We have 10k at 500-1000 + 100. If we were to shove

**First thing to do is to estimate calling ranges for each person**

utg+1: 99+

utg+2: 88+

mp:77+

HJ:77+

CO: 66+,ATo+ = 9.2%

BTN:66+,ATo+ = 9.2%

SB :55+,ATo+,KQo = 10.9%

BB:55+,ATo+,KQo = 10.9%

Essentially the avg calling range generally comes out to what the cutoff or hijack will call with,KQs,AJo+ = 8.3%**

Now that we know what calls us on avg, you take the % one person folds on avg and take it to the X power, where X = the number of people remaining. In the above scenario it would be 0.917 x 0.917 x 0.917 x 0.917 x 0.917 x 0.917 x 0.917 x 0.917 = .4999 (**Everyone folds on avg about 50% of the time**). 

Now that we know what range on avg is calling us

**The Fold Equity = Blinds and antes X % everyone folds

**For Call Equity we first need to figure out what our hand's equity is vs the range that calls us.** We then add the blinds and antes to our stack

equity 	win 	tie 	      pots won 	pots tied	
Hand 0: 	58.638%  	57.94% 	00.70% 	     625045632 	  7508514.00   { 66+, AJo+ }

**Hand 1: 	41.362%**  	40.67% 	00.70% 	     438688860 	  7508514.00   { 77 }

Thus the first part of the Equation for CE looks like: (12400 x 0.41)

The 2nd part of the Equation for CE is: - (10000 x 0.59)

Now the final part of the CE is we take the % everyone calls us on avg and multiply it by the number we obtained from our range Equities. (In this case we multiply it by .5 as we get folds from everyone half the time

**The CE Part of the Equation in total is**:  ((12400 x 0.41) - (10000 x 0.59)).5

**Thus the final Hand Equation is: (2400 x .50) + ((12400 x 0.41) - (10000 x 0.59)).5** 

1200 + (5084-5900).5

1200 + (-816).5

1200 - 413 = +787 chips or .79bb

This formula may seem a bit daunting at first, you will see a noticeable increase in your ability to play with a shorter stack in tournaments. As with anything else in poker it is not an exact science and there is a lot of skill derived from being able to properly estimate calling ranges. However if you are determined enough, this equation and PokerStove is a great way to begin your journey to becoming a great short stack player (in depth understandings of ICM theory and NASH theory can come later on). 

Also it is important to note that this is just the equation for our equity when ONLY one person calls us. Occasionally we will get multiple callers when we shove

(Note:This equation can also be used to figure out 3-bet shove math as well!)

It is much easier to explain this stuff in person/over skype

Pick a site from here: http://www.mergegaming.com/partners.html

Any of them will be good for you as they all run the same software and all of the rooms are interconnected. Pick one at random! The only difference is the user interface

### Freerolls

Freerolls occur at 0:00 EST (Midnight),000 players and no late entry so try to sign up early, up to 4 hours. They pay CASH to the top 4 ($18, $14, $9, $5) as well as satellites to other tourneys (SNG/MTTs) for quite a few spots.

### Steps

In the client you'll find a ""Player Admin"" button, you can exchange 250 play money chips for a Step 1 entry ticket.

* Top 3 in Step 1 get a Step 2 ticket
* Top 2 in Step 2 get a Step 3 ticket (3rd place gets another Step 2 ticket)
* Top 1 in Step 3 wins $1.00 cash (2nd gets a Step 3 and 3rd gets a Step 2 entry)

Then you can enter either a $0.10+$0.01 6-seat SNG or a $0.50+$0.10 10-seat SNG to try to earn money that way.

NOTE: You can get a max of 10 free Step 1 tickets per day. The average player will make ~95 Step 1 attempts before cashing $1. So this method is pretty terrible

1) Go to https://bitfloor.com/ and create an account

2) Click on the 'Deposit' tab

3) Go to your local Bank of America with the instructions found on the next page. All you need is the cash and the account number from the instructions page (the teller filled out the out-of-state deposit slip for me). Double check that you are sending the exact amount correctly: this is how they verify you! LocalTill generates a random $ amount that is ~1% higher than your deposit amount as a form of ID on your account. 

4) The deposit should show up in USD on your bitfloor account very quickly

5) Click on the 'Trade' tab in bitfloor. Depending on how impatient you are, limit orders may take longer (I had one go through in about 10 minutes and am currently waiting on another one).

6) Once you have a balance of bitcoins on your bitfloor account

7) Now that you have bitcoins in your BlockChain wallet

8) The transaction will be verified automatically (5-30 minutes)


As for the actual poker experience itself: I'll just confirm some opinions that others have said around here. The play is very soft (I found whales willing to call my all-in with any two preflop), etc, though a few basic stats are automatically tracked in text form (hand histories, flops seen, stuff like that).

**some general rules**


1. if you don't want to say anything when you raise

2. don't string bet - if you say ""bet/raise"" but don't say the actual amount, you have to push in the chips in one single motion into the middle of the table.

3. you can sit down with more than the maximum buy-in if you're previous table breaks off (i.e.so they can create a full table by consolidating 2 small tables). if you're playing 1/2

4. make sure your cards are behind the line

5. if someone calls you

**my personal tips &amp; observations**

1. general rule of thumb - 1/2NL online is different from live. in 1/2 online you'll see people folding 10's to an 8 dollar pre-flop raise. in live even tight aggressive people will call 12 with pocket 10s. 

- the standard live raise i see with ""raise-able"" hands is 10-16 bucks pre-flop. when i see raises of 6 to 8

2. if you are a great online player and you immerse yourself in countless books and poker theory

3. some stereotypes of players:

- old men: they are solid tight

- young scruffy guys with bad hygiene, wear hoodies and cargo shorts: usually the live grinders, though i have no understanding of how they grind at 1/2 and make a consistent living.

- guys wearing sunglasses - usually they aren't that good and just want to look good.

- asian/middle eastern guys - i can't exactly say they all have good poker knowledge but they tend to be aggressive with their hands, they can trap and actually have a solid hand. just be alert or don't get in a hand with them with regular-strength cards or you'll get outplayed.

4.  don't berate a noob player. you don't have to say ""great hand"" or anything either. just don't call him out. there's plenty of times when i see these ""good"" players that rip noobs a new asshole and later find that they are in a hand with a noob and are stuck more than half their stack in the pot. the good player goes all in and the noob calls

5. you don't have to get into a hand with a better player if your hand isn't good. its very mentally draining to think of all the lines and scenarios and making the right moves when you are playing against a good player. i will fold JQ pre-flop vs an aggressive player but will raise or reraise against a noob and try to outplay him. at the end of the day

So instead of going the route of buying BitCoins I set up a miner on my ATI 7950 and let it run for ~2 days until I had .15 BTC (~$1.95 US).  I then transfered that to my BitCoin Wallet.  Side note. The BitCoin client app that stores your wallet takes a LONG time to sync.  It's downloading a ~3GB file that contains all BitCoin transactions EVER.  I have a 50MBs connection and it took about 24 hours to catch up which is terrible and I sent them a bug report.  I was able to mine in the mean time using a separate app that I got from the BTCGuild.com mining pool.  So as previously stated it took about two days to get to the point were I could actually make a deposit.

The card room I picked was SealsWithClubs.eu and they had my transfer almost instantly.  That said it took a bit of poking around to make sure I did send the transfer to the right place.  It's very obvious that this is a small scale room.  That said I was able to quickly sit down at a table and start playing.

Software wise the room is very basic.  I don't currently have HEM or PT installed but since the room is flash based in side of your browser I doubt the HUDS will work.  There is a way to view your hand history for the table your at but I didn't see a way to save HH locally so I don't know that you can even add the data to your program of choice.  On top of that I tried copying and pasting a hand history to weaktight.com and handconverter.com neither of which could read the hand.  So for serious play right now it's kind of a bust.

That said I did almost quadruple my funds in about 2.5 hours so that's not bad.  All in all it did scratch my poker itch.  While the software leaves a lot to be desired I think I will keep playing and encourage others to do so with the hope that it will encourage other rooms to start taking US players with BitCoins.",,t5_2qhix,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/1672d1/first_impression_of_bitcoin_poker_from_a_usa/

This last weekend I was playing $3/$6 limit HE (w/ a kill if the pot goes above $60 dollars... is this unique to my home casino?) at my local casino.  The table composition was pretty awesome with a perfect mix of tourists and ""regulars"".  I am 22 years old and the other regular was maybe 25-26 years old (both of us full time college students making a little easy fun money on the side).  The tourists were all 50+ years old. Most were ""elderly"" gentlemen with the oldest being an estimated 80 years old.  These fellas were the guys with near infinite bank rolls playing the ""old school"" gamblers game.  It was clear they were there for fun and let the cards play.  All in all they were giving away money because it was raise raise raise with top pair into straights

-The Story-

This one older gentlemen (call him Blue Shirt) left the table to attend to something.  He may have gone to eat, etc.  I didn't pay attention to it, but he was gone for roughly an hour.  Blue Shirt was a guy with an endless bankroll and there for fun, he was giving away money to me and the other regular.  He was not a very good player but he knew enough to get into troubles.  

So Blue Shirt is gone for a looooong time.  While Blue Shirt is gone the evening tournament breaks so a waiting list develops for another $3/$6 game.  The house opens another $3/$6 table right next to ours because of this.  So we have two full $3/$6 games right next to each other.  The clientele for both games is roughly the same with two young guys and the rest older men (and one middle age woman at the other table).

Time goes on....

Next thing you know the poker silence (lol) is disturbed by an older Asian guy yelling ""WHO ARE YOU!?""  He has a seat, apparently he got his seat played a few rounds and then left for dinner or something.  He had just returned...  With the commotion  everyone from our table (with Blue Shirt still gone) looks over to see what was going on.  

I SHIT YOU NOT

BLUE SHIRT WAS PLAYING THE ASIAN GUYS STACK AT THE OTHER $3/$6 TABLE!!!!  EVERYONE AT OUR TABLE HAD A LOOK LIKE ""WHAT?""

Apparently Blue Shirt had come back after his long absence and mistakenly sat at the other $3/$6 table and began playing someones stack.  All unknown to the dealer and everyone else at the table.  I suppose its logical to consider that on a weekend, and the fact that $3/$6 is in many ways the new comers game, it is possible for this situation to happen.  

Floor was called and that table froze in a strong WTF moment.  

But it gets better....

Blue Shirt had been literally giving away money to our table.  He was down at least $600 since I had sat down (I had him for at least $200).  Apparently

So we have:

Blue Shirt playing someone elses stack.  
He made money on this stack.  

Situation:

How is this situation solved in your home casinos?  Have you ever witnessed such a thing?


Solution at my place:  Luckily these two guys were very kind with regards to the situation.  Blue Shirt was clearly embarrassed and had honestly become disoriented with what table he was playing at.  I had my back to the poker room entrance so there was no way that I could have seen him walk over to the other table.  The Asian Guy was mixed emotion about it.  He was laughing and then at the same time saying ""how much does he owe me"" (lol).  Little did he know that Blue Shirt made him some cash.  It turns out that he made around $200 bucks thanks too a could of huge kill pots. 


The Asian Guy decides that its only fair that they split the profit and continue on with the night.  I figure that I would have come to the same conclusion if I was in the same situation.

The best part of the matter was the kindness exhibited during the ordeal.  It was clear that these two guys understood the ""old man"" nature to do such a thing.  The funniest thing of the whole ideal is that the Asian guy called Blue Shirt ""Old Man"" for the rest of the night.

I thought I would do my part to increase the quality of this subreddit by writing a few posts about tournament poker. I can't promise that I will make a lot of these or that they will come very often.

This first post is very basic tournament strategy

----

**The value of tournament chips**

Knowing the value of the chips you have

This is most definitely not the case for tournaments. Let's understand why:

You are sitting down in a 10 man Sit and Go. It costs $10 to enter and everyone gets 1000 chips. So 1,000 chips is worth $50. From start to finish the value of an average chip is cut in half.

Imagine now that you are in the same SNG, but for the sake of this example we are going to assume he is. So that leaves $50 to be distributed among you and the other two short stacks. This means your 500 chips is now worth $16.67. That's almost 70% more than 1,000 chips was worth when the tournament started.

As you can see from the example

To illustrate this I tell people to imagine your stack as one huge stack of 1-chips. Whenever you bet or call you take chips from the top of the stack. Whenever you win chips you put them back on the top. If you have a 1, but if you were to lose only one chip off of a stack of 2 chips, that would cut your chances to win in half.

It is theoretically possible to get 2nd place in a tournament with only one chip

*The chips you put on the top of your stack are worth less than the same chips on the bottom of your stack.*

**How does this affect how you play?**

It affects your strategy a lot because this means that the chips you risk are worth more than the chips you stand to win. If someone went directly all-in preflop and showed you their hand. You are exactly 51% to win against him

To put it simple this means call less and raise more compared to cash games.

Understanding how the value of your chips change throughout the tournament is absolutely crucial to being a good tournament player.

There are various ways of calculating (by that I mean approximating) the actual dollar value of your tournament stack. The post popular method is ICM

I suggest you read up a bit about ICM (Independent Chip Model) and try a calculator to see how the values change with your stack. This will allow you to get a better feel for it.",,t5_2qhix,1346442800.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/z4ub1/tournament_strategy_chapter_1/

Some context: I'm a 30 year old architect who had an accident driving drunk 7 years ago

I went to my local underground room after one of my best friend's wedding. I wanted to give him a bass guitar as a wedding gift (which is a stupid idea, I started ok but it didn't end well. I lost about $1k. So when I had to pay I realized I had no actual way to do it but to transfer some Stars dollars I had. I check my account and it says I have $228, and because it wasn't enough I decided to flip them on a turbo HUSNG. My JJ got beat by a straight right away in an all in pre. Deposited $500 more and tried to flip again, same story, my 99 this time was beat by A7. One more time I said, this time $1k, 1 match, villain payed with AQ and rivered 2 pair. I felt like puking

I came home and started crying. I know this is not that much money, I can grind some cash up only to get wasted and lose it all, it has happened many times. 

Anyway, cigarettes, gambling and other drugs are taking the best of me, so that was it, I'm done I said. He was kind enough to front me some cash to get out of the financial hole I'm in right now. 

I feel now liberated and I like the fact that now there's no way but up. I'm quite a talented 3d artist and architect, gambling and drugs have been my refuge since my accident, and I just figured I deserve better. So here I come sobriety, wish me luck :)

What I learned playing poker:

- You can be as talented as Ivey

- Chances are that you are not nearly as good as you think

- Money don't mean shit to me. I'm glad to have this at least.

- Poker players are generally not interesting people. I'd rather have my old friends back.

- I'm talented but useless. I can exploit the passive fish and piss of regulars so that they make bad decisions against me. It's awesome and I love it, I don't think I'm able to exercise a healthy BRM.

So that's it man. This is probably my last r/poker thread

So, such as how he's perceived, how his opponent is playing (VPIP/PFR are vital stats in any hand, but if you're not using a HUD, general observations such as ""he's very aggressive"" will do), and then any further stats that may be useful (flop c-bet).

Additionally, the strength of the players, the stakes and the current stage of the tournament are all useful to know, depending on whether you're playing a cash game or tournament.

**GOOD HAND EXAMPLE** ([source](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/mlgn7/550_mtt_jj_facing_a_khigh_flop/))

&gt; CO is running at 17/8 over 70 hands, leading me to believe that he's not fantastic. He's c-bet the flop on 3 out of 3 occasions.

&gt; I'm playing ABC TAG poker

&gt; We're both fairly deep, and it's a Sunday, so the field is both large and weak, meaning that I'm apprehensive to get it all-in pre here, because I think that I can use my skill edge well instead of relying on coinflips, and we're approaching the bubble, so I don't want to bust over something so marginal.

&gt; I put him on a fairly decent range due to the limper, AQ+. I expect him to c-bet the dry flop here with ATC, but his 1/2 pot bet seems to suggest that he's not strong - at these stakes I notice a lot of 2/3rds+pot bets with strength.

&gt; When he checks the turn, without betting too much to lose lots of money if he does actually has a K. Afterwards, he commented ""I knew you didn't have a K"", which is weird considering how I believe I took the exact line that anyone would have taken with a K.

**BAD HAND EXAMPLE** ([source](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/mb2qw/poker_hand/))

&gt;I had AKo on the button. One raise to 3bb, i don't know.

&gt;I just call


As well as the poor formatting

* Is this a cash game or a tournament
* Is it live or online
* Are your opponents good players
* How many people are at the table
* What are the stakes/buyin
* If it's a tournament is it near a bubble
* What's everyone's position
* What does the original raiser do in response to the 3-bet
* Who bets huge on the flop
* Did you have to check to let him bet huge on the flop
* What was his bet size
* Did you have a diamond in your hand
* How many hands did you have on the villain?

And can you then see how hard it was for everyone to analyse his hand? Most people didn't even try.

Here's a variance simulator, and a couple of examples.",dO_ob,27,18, it's most often used to describe the uncontrollable fluctuation of a player's actual winrate over a certain hand sample from its expected value.
   
As a result of variance, fifty thousand hands of cash game NLH, you have **no idea** what your true winrate as a player is. Variance is a **huge** factor in a sample as small as fifty thousand hands.
  
By way of example, and it will chart the progress of a number of virtual players with your winrate and SD. You enter a number of hands to perform these trials over, and a number of virtual players to model, and it outputs a graph.
   
For example, all with the same true long-term winrate, all playing as well as each other, and all with the same expected level of variance. The luckiest five players make **almost six and a half times** what the unluckiest five players make.
 
If we adjust the graph for [5k hands](http://imgur.com/WXXNi.png) (the number of hands a recreational player might play in a month)
  
The purpose of this post is to encourage novice players to **not indulge in results orientated thinking**. In that last graph, and should give up now, because he's played all month and lost a fair bit of cash. If we narrow a simulation down further, to the few hundred hands a recreational player might play in a day, we can draw almost **no conclusion** about that player's actual winrate from the amount of money they win or lose, because variance is **by far** the overriding influence.
 
You need a large hand sample before you can start trying to establish your long-term winrate. There is a still a lot of variance for most players over 50k hands, the luckiest 10% are still earning 40% more than the unluckiest 10%.

Friends and I get together every couple weeks and play in my basement. We call it Robertson's Den the Big Game (My last name isn't actually Robertson but you get the point) for no other reason that just because. It's usually a 1/2 game split between NLHE and PLO, and you get to see everyone's cards but your own. This game gets out of control pretty fast I can tell you.

So I'm on the button and we're 5 handed. UTG raises to $7, SB calls, BB checks. UTG is holding [T](/hearts)[7](/hearts), CO has napkins, SB has napkins, and BB has [3](/hearts)[3](/spades). I'm assuming by all the loose action my hand isn't godlike.

FLOP ($35): [A](/hearts)[Q](/hearts)[2](/spades). Everyone looks at the flop and then looks at everyone elses hand. I notice CO looking at my hand and having a sort of ""wow"" look, UTG checks, CO checks, going on my drunken read I bet $20. SB folds, BB raises to $50, UTG calls, CO calls

TURN ($235): [2](/hearts)
		
At this point I'm thinking I was pretty strong on the flop. Normally when we play this we try to raise each other to make each other fold the winner. It's happened a lot which leads to a looser game most of the time and everyone calling. I'm drunkenly trying to put together information. UTG raised preflop, UTG and CO both fold, and I'm almost sure I have a good hand now and he's trying to get me to fold. I call.
				
RIVER ($385) [T](/clubs) 
		
CO is pretty pumped that we're getting a big pot going. He keeps looking at my hand an the board. Obviously I've got some dirt Q2 and I'm huge. Sickest soul read ever while being half in the bag. BB thinks long and hard while looking at my hand. He's trying to think if he can get me off it. Finally he goes all in for about $150. **SNAP CALL** I flip over my hand and say ""good try bro."" and look down at:

Until now, and I've been the most active moderator since. [ibarg](http://www.reddit.com/user/ibarg) is the other active moderator of this reddit, and he deserves great credit for being the guy who got up and usurped steveoola, who created this reddit and promptly got lost.

**guyupstairs**

My screenname on Full Tilt was guyupstairs. Full Tilt was the site I played most on. Here is what PokerTableRatings has for the three stakes I've played most (ring games):

    Stake            Hands    Net     BB/100
    $0.05/$0.1 NLH   17
    $1/$2 NLH        15
    $0.01/$0.02 NLH  14

Note how long I spent at 1c/2c, but there will be more on that later. I actually got to the point that I was properly bankrolled to play $400 NL (i.e. $2/$4), but I recognised that my bankroll had finally overtaken my ability, so I didn't take a shot.

My lifetime bankroll is over $9

Here are my OfficialPokerRankings results (multi-table tournaments):

**Range vs. Range**

The software I have written is called Range vs. Range. Until now I have been posting about it as user [RangeVsRange](/user/rangevsrange), and I accept some responsibility for that. Mostly I think the problem is that people who understand poker theory haven't noticed it yet. Probably because they're too busy winning money, and spending their spare poker time doing what they've always done to try to improve their poker game: watching videos, getting coaching, reading books and discussing hands.

For an explanation of why I don't think videos, see [here](http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/15/poker-theory/how-we-improve-poker-1175422/) on Two Plus Two.

For the post where I explained what this software was about, /r/rangevsrange.

----

**The offer**

I'm going to close the Range vs. Range software and make it invitation-only. I will offer accounts to all who wish to take me up on this offer, so you'll have to be a redditor to participate. (Later, I might make the offer available to the Two Plus Two micro stakes forum. Depending on how this goes.)

I will set up a training programme in the Range vs. Range software.

I want to make it very clear here that my software is actually aimed at mid-stakes players and above, but that's less true at microstakes because people don't make thin 3bets very often. You also will not particularly have to think about ranges, because the ranges will be near-optimal. This means that the cards your opponent will have when playing on Range vs. Range will be the cards they would have if they were a strong player. The one caveat to the usefulness of this software is that it trains you to play against good players, and while microstakes has some good players, it also has many weak players. That's something we'll have to discuss in time.

So, you will become comfortable with and it you will come to know your own strategy for this situation very well. This will make it very easy to play when this situation comes up at the poker table, and because you know exactly what your default strategy is, you will also find it much easier to make *slight* adjustments to this strategy based on what you know about your opponent. Much more on this later.

Here are the situations we will start with. I haven't thought much about these

* Middle position player raises to 3 big blinds
* Late position player raises to 3 big blinds
* Middle position player raises to 3 big blinds

Once you can play well in these situations

* You raise and end up out of position (acting first on later streets)
* You call and end up in position (acting last on later streets)
* You raise and end up in position
* You call and end up out of position
* You raise and end up acting second in a three-way flop
* You call and end up in position
* You call in the big blind and end up out of position in a three-way flop

As people show proficiency in all of these situations, ask other people on /r/rangevsrange how their strategies differ. Or just see if you can tell what your opponents are doing better than you! And, as I said, I'll be around to discuss it all too.

Now, you will get good at lots of different situations. Later, I will add situations like this so you can target more specific parts of your game:

* The flop has an Ace, and the out-of-position player makes a continuation bet (having bet preflop).
* The same flop when an in-position player was pre-flop aggressor and makes a continuation bet.
* The same two situations as above
* The big blind calls a bet and then donks into the flop.

But

Well, what it means, and I'll give you a few tips on how to start with strategy, and how to get the most out of it. There will be lots of concepts to discuss. The training schedule will change as I think about it more, and discuss it with the you and the rest of /r/poker. I'll help you out, and if you show good results and can't afford to deposit online, I might even stake you.

I hope that what we achieve, useful and even fun training programme. And I hope it proves to be an **effecient** way to learn poker, and maybe even **sufficient** by itself. All I ask is that you put in the effort, and give it your best shot. **Who's in?**

----

Range vs. Range is now closed to the public, and we have had a chance to discuss it, I'll be opening the site on an invitation-only basis.

If you're interested, or subscribe to /r/rangevsrange.

All the players are very good - I am probably the weakest player at the table, the best way to get better at poker is to play players better than you.  (For stakes you can afford

Right now, but I'm still the short stack at the table. 

And I'm UTG

I raise to $1.50

Folded to Button

(Awesome!)

SB then 4-bets half his stack to $30.  

(REALLY AWESOME!)

BB (a competent TAG) then *shoves* for $90.  

(...waaaaaait...) 

BB is a very tight player, KK, QQ, and AK.  AK would probably call and try to flop an A or K, as the 4-better's range includes AQs, TT, JJ, I think she would flat call and this time try NOT to hit an A or K, I'm only calling for half the pot

Her range is Aces.  Her range is *Aces.*  

But I still tank, seriously, kings preflop?  There is only ONE hand that KK doesn't dominate, and that's AA. My read could be wrong, she could have QQ, or maybe JJ here.  It's almost never wrong to get your money in preflop with KK.  And such good money it is too... I could triple up here... and if I'm wrong, I could just say that KK vs AA is just ""the cost of doing business.""  

""Sorry guys

I count and stack my money, I'm giving you a **huge** amount of respect here."" I fold, and hold onto my cards. 

The cutoff folds.  Button calls.  The SB had QQ.  BB turns over her cards.  ***Pocket Aces.***

I triumphantly flip over my pocket kings, and I was *right*.

One day you find a pack of cards on a footpath, rub your finger along the box.  A large blue genie erupts out of the packet, floating in front of you with his arms crossed.

You ask him if you get 3 wishes, powerful powers, all related to the amazing game of poker.  I present to you your choices, and only one, may you decide upon.  It will last your entire lifetime and will never fade away.""

The genie then presents to you the 8 poker powers, some are quite powerful, and may make you a target, or may make it seem like you are cheating or playing unethically.  (Kicker: These abilities apply only to Hold 'em.)

Now choose...

1) You have the ability to see one of every opponent's hole cards each round in your mind.  Example: In a 10-handed game, of each of the 10 opponents in the hand as soon as dealing is complete.

2) You have the ability to see 2 of the flop cards (randomly selected

3) You, never again sitting in the blinds, always on the button.  For the nerds; Imagine that the dealer always passes you the button if you accidentally move it, and *insists* you were the small blind last turn (or the CO, whichever direction...) and all the players/floor managers/security/cameramen will always agree with you about your position.

4) You can see the suit of every card in your opponents hands (all players involved in a hand) as well as the suit of the flop

5) Once a week, and to then control the flop, turn and river cards.  For example, On Tuesday 11am, at the local casino I could decide the next hand I'm in, I'm going to get 22 UTG, limp in, another will get KK

6) Once per hour, you know what they are.  If they are old and forgetful, you'd just wait until they looked again and get the values then.  You could read their mind for tells/bluffs/strength etc.  You would know what they are planning.

7) You can entice someone (1 person) to shove or fold once an hour.  Ie: if you have the nuts, even if it would cost them $1 to call.

8) You have the concentration of a God, you NEVER TILT, EVER.  You can sit down at a table for 6 months and never leave, it wouldn't make any difference.  You always play your A game.",,False,,True,t3_qaz1a

Currently, the variance will obviously be a lot higher due to more draws and more hands seeing a flop, but from experience, you'll get paid off with the nuts a lot more often than not. 

To get started in PLO

1. Be able to calculate your pot odds really well. PLO is much less of a game of reading your opponent and more about the math behind your calls/bets.

2. Don't chase draws that won't give you the nuts. A Queen high flush might just get you in a lot of trouble against the King or Ace high flush. Likewise

3. Pick and choose your starting hands wisely. 6789 double suited is much better than JJ23. At the same time though

4. Always look for re-draws. Two pair is nice on the flop

Goals:

* Simplicity (help text will be avoided in favour of making the interface intuitive).  
* Fast loading (as you can see
* Accurate: rounded to nearest 0.01%
* Pleasing interface (click
* Shareable - the link at the bottom creates a 'permalink' to the results
* Accessible - works even without JavaScript enabled!

One of the best features (in my opinion) is that you can type in your address bar something like: **pocketodds.com/aa67** which will redirect straight to the results for Aces vs 67 -&gt; http://pocketodds.com/AsAc-6h7h

Supported browsers: Safari, Opera, IE6+ (although IE6 will not be super pretty). If *any* of these browsers have bugs please let me know and I'll try to fix it up.

Slated for future updates:

* Equity option (to combine win and tie odds)
* Pie graph showing likely winning hands (fullhouse
* Option to show more decimal places if the user wants (or as an exact fraction)
* Odds for Omaha (likely have to wait a while for that

Limps to BTN - young, and has been opening ~15% of pots, more in position.  He makes it $40.  I am on the straddle with [K](/hearts)[Q](/diamonds).  I 3bet to $160.  Folds to him and he very hesitantly calls after double checking my stack size.  


Flop:  [8](/hearts)[2](/hearts)[4](/clubs)   I cbet $200

Without my reasoning - what do you think of this?




~~


EDIT: My defense.  I think he is bluffing here a good amount of the time

(Pot before shove)(his folding%) + (Pot after he calls shove)(winning%) - (Cost of shove)(Losing%) = EV


(1150)(b) + (1150+740)(1-b)(x) - (1140)(1-x)(1-b)


where b = his bluffing % (that folds to a shove)

If he is raise/folding ONLY 20% of the time

If he is raise/folding ONLY 10% of the time

If he is NEVER raise/folding and this is only a pot odds situation

RESULTS:  CardCounter0 turned back time and folded my hand preflop.

Company: Royal Caribbean
Ship: Navigator of the Seas
# of Passengers: 2114

Poker: There was only one table, this was not the case.

The play onboard was the worst I had ever seen. By default, I petitioned the casino manager for it as soon as I heard. The min BI is $50 max $300 and you can buy in over $300 up to whatever the chip leader at the table has. The table didn't get going until at least 9pm and the casino shuts down at 2AM, if you're interested in a game, sit down with a drink at 9, chat with the dealer and whoever else wanders over, before you know it, you'll have a full table

The only advice I can give is BE FRIENDLY and PLAY TIGHTLY. These are the worst players I had ever been on a table with. For example, 3rd pair, and any gutshot. Conversely, you CANNOT BLUFF AT ALL SO DONT TRY. Are they getting aggressive preflop? They have a PP. They will jam with 77 just as easily preflop as AA and KK. 

These guys are there to gamble a little, some guys asks the table if this is no limit. Also, try not to get frustrated with the slow play, I can't imagine we were averaging more than 20 hands/hour.

So relax, you can expect to pay for your cruise playing &lt;4hrs/ night.

* Title: In your title it isn't useful to post ""Did I play this right?"", etc... If you're posting a hand for analysis, people will tell you these things. What you want to have in there is the STAKES and type of GAME that the hand was at example: 2NL, 5PLO, 1/3 Live, 100NL Zoom, $125 Tourney

* The Hand: Please convert your hands. It's so much easier to keep track of stack sizes, but make sure that you include stack sizes, positions, clear description of the action, etc...

* Reads: Include reads. Please be as detailed as you can be here.  If you have literally zero reads that's ok

* Results: Please don't include the results. 

* Post what you think: Make an effort to figure out what the best play is and why. /r/poker (or any other poker forum) is not here to spoonfeed you answers. Putting in some extra effort to figure out what would be best before posting will help you be able to ask the right questions

1328614605.0,pek8m,Playing shortstack live at a casino: A short summary,xatmatwork,31,10,51,"So I was PM'd asking about how I play shortstack at a casino.  Now while I'm not the most seasoned player this has worked well for me so far.  Please feel free to criticize or provide more feedback.

Let's say the blinds are $1/$2, like somewhere in the $14+ region would be amazing but anything over $10 is good.  You should definitely, for maximum profit, be sitting in with near the minimum buyin.  I'd say aim for around $50 to $60.  

The reason for this is that when people are considering their opens, they (should be) raising to a level where approximately three pot sized bets, one on each of the following streets, would get the average player all in.

You can profit **massively** from this in **any** position.  Not only this but by buying in with less

Your range:

Definite shoves:

* 88 and higher

* KQs, AK

Depends on your reads:

* 77 and lower

* AJ, KJs, QJs

Do not be tempted to play:

* Suited connectors

**Early Position:**

You want to **limp** with your hands.  Allow somebody else to open

If nobody opens and you're forced to see a flop

**Middle Position:**

If somebody in early position has opened

If there is enough money in the pot due to limpers (around 20% of your stack)

Otherwise

**Late Position:**

If somebody has opened

If somebody has 3bet, lean towards folding.

If several limpers

If it has folded around to you or there is only one limper

You should consider a smallish raise


After doubling up or stealing lots of money

Some things to note:

* Once people start clocking that you are limp shoving, knowing that you have a higher chance than usual of seeing a flop!

* So it went well, then you lost it all in a big hand.  Immediately you are tempted to rebuy for $300 because you want to win it all back.  **Don't do this, use discipline.** Rebuy for minimum again, and take advantage of the now even deeper stacks!  Remember you are only down $50 for the night, not $350.

* You obviously need to adjust your range depending on how the players on the table are playing, medium strength aces and kings, tiny pocket pairs?  These are a dream hand to shove on top of.",,False,,t5_2qhix,,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/pek8m/playing_shortstack_live_at_a_casino_a_short/

**Situation #1**

You know how bad players talk constantly about how they folded the winning hand? Ya know like it matters? As if they should have called a 3-bet pre with A4 cause the flop was 44Q? I'm pretty used to hearing that. What bothers me is players doing that while the hand is being played.

EXAMPLE:

I raise from EP with KK and pick up 2 callers. The flop is 8-8-9. While I'm waiting for my action I hear one guy do a quiet chuckle and whisper something to the guy next to him that definitely contained the words ""I folded"". The guy replies back laughingly

I bet and both players fold.

After the hand I say something to the one guy about influencing the action while not in the hand. I don't know if I didn't explain the situation right but the entire table looks at me like I'm a freakin alien.

Am I wrong here? This happens a lot where I play and no one seems to notice or care.


**SITUATION #2**

I crippled a guy in a tournament and he was left with slightly more than the BB which me tosses in on the following hand. It's folded to the BB who calls and they turn up their cards.

All-in player has 9-7

Boards runs out Q-T-2-4-4

The dealer says, ""Uhhh wasn't that a chop? Pair of fours with a Q-T-9?"" The dealer asks around if a pair of 4's was out and everyone nods. They call the floor and end up chopping this guy's stack in half.

He gets upset and calls me a ""fucking asshole.""

I've been powering through the beginner's guide on r/poker

~ I know this might end up being kind of long, and also enjoying poker very much; I wanted to see what the fuss was about. I feel I am very good at improving and analyzing, and am the kind of person who will be happy to grind out hours upon hours of tedious work to achieve any minor improvement. I started out on the free play tables, where I went from 1000 chips to 160,000 in less than a weekend (I felt this was an accomplishment at the time, and made me think I was better than I am) With that said, I'll jump into the newbie problems I'm having. ~

The big problems I'm having are these:
1.What are the super fundamental mechanics of poker (primarily preflop, and gives me the following issues:

   1a. I'm dealt AKs on my 1c

   1b. Why is it better to raise and isolate with a good hand

   1c. It seems to me that getting to the flop for 2c and hoping for trips, only to find your AK matches nothing on the board, and now you have to fold to your opponents bet (As the micro strategies would tell me, anyway!). This seems most definitely to not be the case, but I can't wrap my head around why. If this was made super clear to me I'd really appreciate it!

2. A few questions on buy ins.

   2a. I've read that I should get 200-300 big blinds (or max for the table) for no limit holdem, you can afford to get into your pots comfortably, and pay your blinds, and it also lets you really nail those that chase you on a good hand. Is this thinking correct? Is there more to it?

   2b. I typically play with $1 on zoom or $1 per table on 2-3 9-max tables and generally end up losing most of it in small increments. Is this bad (the buy in sizing)? I am almost certain I would do proportionally better with $6

   2c. When I play play money tables, much larger bankroll (usually 200-500bb). I don't know if it's the only reason, but I always feel way more comfortable and I do really well. Is this a result of play money players being god awful, or is it the benefit of a bigger buy in? How is it weighted to each?

3. Analysis and improvement. How do I do it?

   3a. I know there is a hand history in pokerstars, the replays lets you see everything from both players perspective -analyzing and assessing is entirely logical. In poker, I'll be in a tough spot and decide to fold. I'll never ever know if that was a good decision or not. Sometimes I win a hand from the other guy folding. I'll never ever know if that was good either, because I don't know their hand. How can I solve this? What kind of methods can I use to analyze my own hands?

   3b. If I were a really,2 table?
I'm not asking because I want to make money
 Currently I am consistently losing on these small tables and would like to know how I can tell if I'm improving. If the answer is ""Durrr would easily be able to get $5 profit from 1 table per hour with only very minimal downswing"" that's where I want to aim for. If the answer is ""well, getting a total of $5/h"" then I'd be a little disappointed, but be not be expecting rapid improvement over simple fixes.

   3c. Lastly, and would love any advice!

Thanks VERY much for reading. Thanks even more if you can give me some answers. 

 I want to emphasize how much I appreciate this and I'm really looking forward to being part of the poker community if I can ever beat the 1c2c!

~EDIT - Corrected my misuse of bankroll in place of buy in. Thanks for the correction!

     Thanks to everyone for your great responses. I'm finding bits of knowledge through all your comments and am very happy. If I don't manage to get an individual response to you

What are some tells that you absolutely

**tell** When someone shoves, or close to the nuts. side note: 5-10% chance he really has to leave.

**tell** When the flop comes in favor, a form of reassurance. 

**tell** A snakelike tongue gesture, or when contesting a chop at a final table and the person gets the bigger %. side note: this tell is RARE, I have only seen it twice since reading Read em and Reap a couple years ago. 

**tell** The BOSS, and basically looks like your boss. **meaning** He thinks he has you beat (and he may have you beat) usually this is displayed by a alpha male player, or someone who is very vocal with physical tells. side note:  DO NOT CALL THE BOSS, unless you have the nuts, or close to the nuts.

**tell** Players eyes dilate **meaning** A non conscious tell that lets the other player know the villain sees something favorable. Usually seen when a player flops the nuts or a big hand like 4 of a kind. side note: only available as a tell on light colored eyes

I would make this ten times longer if we covered baseline standards. Personally this is one of my favs after baseline standards. **baseline standard tell, slouching, not paying attention) all of a sudden this player gets good hole cards or hits the flop hard and they literally ""spring"" up, both physically and vocally (the tenor will raise in the voice). **meaning** they like what they see, the like it ALOT and will raise, play aggresively, mostly seen by nits and TAG's who get bored at the table and finally get a good pocket pair. side note: you must have a baseline standard on someones posture to master this tell

A last-minute snafu killed my bankroll (my electricity bill got charged four times, I'm actually down $1,000 in my bank account.  For that reason, I only took about $325 with me, instead of the planned $500.  

First night, and played well.  I finished in 4th place, just in the money.  I took back $140, tipping $20 to the dealers, so after the tip and Greg's $40, I'm up $40.  

Second night

I had intellectually thought about the reality playing, the game was not soft at all.  

I only won one pot, I call, BB calls.  flop comes [8](/spades)[4](/spades)[6](/hearts). It's checked to me - I take the free card. There's $60 in the pot. 

The turn is the [K](/diamonds) which gives me Kings w/ a Queen kicker.  

The BB goes all-in with a $80 short-stack.  The MP goes all-in with his $100 stack.  

I count my outs.  Assuming nobody hit a set of kings and was slowplaying the flop

However, but I did.  River's a queen, and my 2P beats BB (lower 2P, slowplayed) and MP (AKo).  

I end up taking down the pot, I ended up at a little north of $300, when I realized that I wasn't having fun, I was nervous, and there was just too much damn money on the table for me to feel comfortable.  I racked up and left, making my total win for the table around $100.

One last thing.

----

**Bankroll:**

Start by buying in to a 1c/2c shallow table for 40c. **Set your buy-in preferences to top you up to 40c.** Stick to full tables

Basically, and to move up you first have to accumulate 5 buy ins at the next level.

**Always leave when you get up to twice your buy-in

You're going to start at shallow tables until you've won some money. Play at 1c/2c shallow until you have $16 (20 buy-ins)

Here are the details:

Less than $16

Less than $40

At $65 ($40 + $25)

Less than $90

At $140 ($90 + $50)

Less than $190

At $315 ($190 + $125)

Less than $440

At $690 ($440 + $250)

If you lose your 5-buy-in shot at the next stake

**Edit:** Don't leave yourself with less than 40c in your account

** Strategy: **

First

That said

----

** Sitting: ** 

Don't pay the blinds at a table with more than one empty seat.

When you join a 9-handed table, wait until you're in the big blind.

If you get deep, and more likely to double up off the person on your right (who you have position on).

----

** Withdrawing / HoldemManager: **

Don't withdraw money. Except to buy HoldemManager or PokerTracker. I think the appropriate time to do this is before you take a shot at $25NL. But I actually suggest you get the trial version of this ASAP

----

** Multitabling **

There's nothing wrong with multitabling from a bankroll management perspective

** If you bust: **

If you bust, and hands, and you believe you know what mistakes / room for improvement there has been in your game. Convince Estoeth of this, and you can try again.

My company has access to a billion-hand database

Here’s our first hand analysis

Blinds 40k/80k
8-handed  
Chen opens to 160k UTG w/KhJh
(Pot 520k)
Heads up to a flop of Qd9c9s
Chen continues for 180k
Turn 2c
Chen checks

Today
1) What’s the typical range of a c-bet in Chen’s spot?  
2) How often does Kelly’s raise induce a fold?  
3) What’s the typical range of a bet/call in Chen’s spot?  

Our overall conclusion is: the historical data provide fairly strong support for Kelly’s flop raise

1) What’s the typical range for a c-bet in Chen’s spot?  

We found 19

Across those hands
- 42.8%: one pair (aka “air”)
- 47.7%: two pair
- 7.5%: trips
- 1.7%: boat
- 0.3%: quads

Takeaway: historically

2) How often does Kelly’s raise induce a fold?  

In our 19,650 times, with the following reactions from the player in Chen’s spot:
- 45.5%: fold
- 39.5%: call
- 15.1%: re-raise

Takeaway: even under conservative assumptions, Kelly wins the 700k in the pot.  Thus, Kelly’s raise is historically worth a minimum of (54.5% * -450k) + (45.5% * 700k) = ~73k.  

3) What’s the typical range of a bet/call in Chen’s spot?  

We found 1

Across those hands
- 30.4%: one pair (aka “air”)
- 56.2%: two pair
- 9.8%: trips
- 2.9%: boat
- 0.8%: quads

Takeaway: the historical range for a player in Chen’s spot has improved dramatically – almost 70% of his range is two pair or better.  Going for full value (i.e. after filling up on the turn) is now worth considering.  

*In case you’re wondering

**The billion-hand database is comprised of online hands played for real money (i.e. no play money hands).  Hole cards are exposed, blind levels have been grouped for ring games (ex: we can’t tell the difference between $5/$10 NLHE and $10/$20 NLHE), suits have been randomly morphed, and hole cards and flops have been randomly reordered.  Although we can’t identify the source(s) of the hands, we can say that we have approval to use them for hand analyses like this one, and that we don’t owe anything to the source(s) – legal, financial

***The definition of “similar spot” is necessarily fuzzy, in this analysis, Q88 rainbow flops are included, and in the future, other small relaxations will be made (likely on an ad hoc basis) to the criteria by which we define similarity.  That said, we are hopeful that the reddit reader will not let the perfect be the enemy of the good – these relaxations add variance, but not even close to enough to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

1368558123.0,1ebyai,The Four Noble Truths of Poker,FootofGod,31,10,14,"There's actually been a fair bit of Buddhism-minded poker work done. I remember seeing an ""eightfold path to poker"" series on deucescracked

**The Four Noble Truths of Poker**

**1. Dukkha** The truth of suffering  
Poker is unavoidably suffering. You will run bad, the worse it becomes. Look at Phil Hellmuth: he's a player with untold millions, who has no doubt run like God time after time, and he's worse off in this category than most of you. I remember him saying in the NBC 2013 Heads Up finals “you'd think someone with everything I've accomplished would be happy with what they've accomplished, but you're not because you had one bad tournament and that's all you think about.” And I think that sums it up pretty nicely. Money, success, results, and the closer you get to perfection, they bleed out into our whole lives


**2. Tahna** The truth of the origin of suffering

Our suffering comes from our ***craving*** to have things our way in the short-term. And keep in mind, one session, one 10,000-hand period, we are permanently thinking “I've got to get some good results. I'd love to run good.” We always want to post a winning session, even if we're smart enough to intelectually know it's impossible. But we always want “this one” to be the one. How many times are players shouting “one time?” If they manage to hit their out and are all in 5 minutes later. What are they usually shouting? Do you think they sincerely hope to lose since they used their “one time?” I don't. Straining over things we have absolutely no control over, which is everything but our decision, making them a part of ourselves, and it is ultimately fuel for suffering.

**3. Nirvana** The truth of the cessation of suffering

There is a way to end suffering, in all of its many forms - posting results, winning money, winning titles, going pro, “proving yourself” and all of these mistakes of the ego and putting only the path to making better poker decisions first. Most people pretend to do this, but we do not actually cultivate our skillfullness as we should because we are more distracted by our cravings to get good hands, etc. It is like looking at a garden full of weeds and cutting what comes above the surface so it looks nice – if you're not finding and pulling the roots, even as you read this

**Those discussing the questions below, give it a day or two before commenting. I know I'm asking for a lot here, but I want to have some good discussion with people's own opinions without having people get spoiled.

Question 1: 

You're playing in a full-ring live $1/2 game with $200 effective stack sizes and against unknown opponents. UTG and UTG+2 limp for $2. We make it $15 with JJ from MP. The BTN flats. UTG raises to $60 and it's folded around to us. Hero ???

He opens for $10 from the cut-off and the SB comes along (pretty weak-tight). We flat in the BB with 7s8s. The flop comes TsJc4s. We check

HERO ??? 

Villain is a pretty decent regular.  Note we are 250bb deep here.  Basically, and overall positionally owned by decent players here.  I don't very much like cbetting, as I feel like most of the times I'll be faced with a raise (which I have to fold to), or a call and there are just tons of turn/river cards I don't want to see.  And even on ""good"" card, I'm OOP deep, and likely to get owned.  Don't really like check/calling either and capping my range, making it pretty easy for him to bet turn + river with a wide range for value and bluffs.

Too nitty to just check/fold here on such a bad board deep OOP against a good player?  Just bet/fold

UTG+1 checks
  
**Turn:** [](/Ac) (**$10.43**
UTG+1 checks

Villain is a 58/13 fish.  On the turn here, expecting calls from Qx, Jx, Tx, and single spades like Ks.  But, if jammed on I think we have to fold, even with all our outs.

So given the turn does decrease the likelihood of being called by worse, Jx that might pay off another street on the river if we checkback.  And the fact that we have a lot of outs to improve that we don't really want to bet/fold.  Is checking back here better than vbetting?

**Turn:** [](/3c) (**$3.50**

**River:** [](/7c) (**$11.50**

Villain is an aggro fish.  Essentially I'm wondering the merits of cbetting the flop versus checking back and taking a bluffcatch line.  Normally I'd cbet the flop here, gaining more value the times we improve, and being able to bluff more profitably if we decide our hand doesn't have enough showdown value on later streets.

However, the value of checking behind increase.  Just not sure if it's enough to make it better than cbetting.  Also, while I do feel like he's likely to bluff future streets, I really won't have too good of a grasp on his frequencies.  Also we give all his inferior hands a free look at 2 cards.

I think cbetting is best

Vbet river, etc).  His strong hands that would call are also pretty likely to bet when checked to I think (any sets he slowplayed, 54s).  And of course he has some bricked flush draws, and 56, that checking might gain value from if he decided to bluff those bricked draws.

Overall, etc here than they are to bluff their bricked draws when checked to, or make ""thin"" value bets.  But on rivers that typically increase our fold equity, I tend to feel like maybe checking is better since now a good portion of his worse hands are going to be inclined to fold.
