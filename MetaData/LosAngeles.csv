1373608256.0,1i4xsi,A PSA from an LAPD Officer,,712,116,343,"Hi folks. I've been seeing something a lot lately that concerns me

When we stop someone, we have our guns out for obvious reasons. We deploy in such a way that all of our guns are pointed in one direction (towards the bad guy) so that if he does something that warrants the use of deadly force, we don't shoot each other in what's commonly referred to as a ""crossfire"" situation.

Here's what bothers me. Whenever we do this, and that is that we have reason to believe that this person might either point a gun at us or actually shoot us. We do these stops all the time and 99% of them don't end in gunfire. But on certain rare occasions they do. And guess what? All of those people out on the street gawking and/or taking pictures and videos are in the line of fire. 

People

I'm writing this because today we arrested a really bad guy for some pretty heinous crimes, daughter, and son all just standing there, pointing, completely in the line of fire and completely oblivious to the fact that had shots been fired, they would have been in the crossfire. 

I'm not saying this because I don't want people recording me. I don't care if I get recorded. In this day and age

I was recently prescribed doxacilin, which helps, but this morning I took it by itself and skipped lunch. I started doing some errands when I started sweating a lot in my car. I figured it was just because it was 82 degrees out and the air conditioning in my car wasn't working. Driving down the 405 I started getting lightheaded, so I pulled off an exit near LAX and got out of my car. I puked on the side of the road about four times, and the fourth time a cop car saw me and stopped over. They obviously thought I was hungover. I explained my situation and told them I needed food in my stomach. They let me leave my car there (I was in no condition to drive) and went and drove me to Burger King, even paid for my meal. I felt better after the meal, they drove me back to my car, maybe a lot of the LAPD are jerks,self,

The adult industry is small and tries it's best to be self policing.  Performers are offered condoms on every set and they are mostly declined.  One of the major reasons is that performers take STI and HIV tests every 28 days (increasingly every 14 days) and are required to present the results on set.  The producers then also confirm the results in a database restricted to production management.  Another reason is that it's simply uncomfortable to have sex for up to 3 hours on and off under hot lights with condoms.  It's a bit unreasonable to have performers wear condoms


The economic impact will be huge for the industry and will cost taxpayer dollars too.  Someone's gotta go check and make sure everyone's willys are wrapped up tight right?  The cost of getting a film permit for adult will go up a lot.  Porn's not making a lot of money these days so people might opt to not pull a permit.  That means less money for the LA film office.  However the consequence of not pulling a permit and getting caught making an adult film will now be a felony!  Many producers won't want to take that risk and will move their productions out of state.  Performers will not get work



The porn business seems pretty shady and scummy from the outside.  It's no shadier or scummier than anything else.  We pay our taxes, we want our communities to thrive. This is on the ballot because people want to exert some sort of moral control on our industry, not because they care for the health and safety of it's performers.




Please vote no on measure B.

Drunk girl is now what I hope safe back at her friends apartment. Here is what happened-

When I found her crying I told her my name, but it was turned off.

She didn't appear too drunk

I first call my only friend in LA (just moved here about two months ago) and he was drunk so not much help. So I called the NON emergency police number. Big fucking help that was. The operator told me this wasn't an emergency (no shit

I go to check on her again and she is still sobbing and my dogs are trying to lick her face off so I asked her again if she remembered where she was staying. She remembered! I looked it up and it was only 4mins away

I brought my dogs in the car with me (I didn't know what I was about to get into) and drove very slowly down the street until she remembered the building. But the building was locked and we couldn't get in. So we went back to my car and told her it would be okay

She went inside and about 10mins later she came out and gave me the thumbs up. I went home. I guess it worked out okay.


Here's what my reason for doing it was- I would want someone to do it for me if I was in that situation and not worried if I would be taken advantage of, whatever. I didn't let her in my room or see my stuff just in case this was some shitty robbery set up. I asked her about facebook, but she couldn't remember her name or password on it.

1333556128.0,rt22z,"Beverly Hills organizing against the subway tunnel under BH High School.  If you care at all about having a station in the heart of Century City, read on.",WhenDookieCalls,285,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/rt22z/beverly_hills_organizing_against_the_subway/

After 30 years in planning, with many stops along Wilshire.

Metro originally had 2 candidate stop locations for Century City- one in the heart of CC at Constellation Blvd and Ave of the Stars

Beverly Hills Unified School District (BHUSD) strongly preferred the Santa Monica Blvd stop

Last month, even though both station locations were clearly marked as options in all previous materials. The reasons for Metro's choice:

   - Ridership would be much higher at Constellation Blvd, reducing ridership.

  - There is an earthquake fault that runs along Santa Monica Blvd.  Putting the station there would mean running the tunnel on top of the fault

Its important to remember that subway line poses no danger to Beverly Hills High School. Subway lines already safely go under all kinds of building in Los Angeles, and Hollywood Blvd. The lines are buried at an average depth of 70' below ground, and are dug with modern, pressurized tunnel-boring machines that leave the ground *more* stable after construction, not less.

It's also unclear what BHUSD's reasoning against tunneling under the high school is

* Tunnel construction would disturb the high school (It wouldn't.)
* Tunnel operation would disturb the high school (It wouldn't.)
* Tunnel would be a terrorist target because there are many jewish students at BH High School (yes they actually said this)
* Ridership would be higher at the Santa Monica Blvd station (next to the golf course)
* The tunnel would prevent the high school's expansion plans.

Of those reasons


Now, and is seeing some success.  They've created a BS website called **[Century City Subway](http://centurycitysubway.org/)** that makes it appear like Century City stakeholders are behind the Santa Monica Blvd. station (They're not.) They encourage BH High School parentsto attend and disrupt Metro's project meetings, creating protest signs for them and even busing them in.  And on articles covering the issue such as the series on **[Beverly Hills Patch](http://beverlyhills.patch.com/articles/metro-hosts-open-house-but-bhhs-subway-tunnel-opponents-shout-you-re-not-hom)**, they counter any comments in favor of the Constellation Station with specious arguments.  They're attempting to influence local and state politicians to join them in their fight against the tunnel. They've even hired their own seismologists to do their own study showing that its unsafe to put the tunnel under BH High School.  Now it appears that their efforts have paid off, and that the Constellation station is in jeopardy.

The fact is, either here in LA or in one of hundreds of other cities that have them, and understand that line buried 70' underground poses no threat or inconvienence to the buildings above it. 

Metro has had to deal with NIMBYs and lawsuits on past projects

Metro has a board meeting coming up on Thursday April 26.  BHUSD is planning on **[busing in residents](http://beverlyhills.patch.com/articles/bhusd-urges-residents-to-lobby-metro-board)** to tell the board they are against the tunnel and the Constellation Blvd station.  If an equal amount of people in favor of the alignment do not also appear at the meeting, if you never plan to take the subway but you just hate traffic then show your support, as building the station far from Century City will discourage people from using it and encourage them to drive. 

The meeting is at 9:00am which sucks

More info **[here](http://la.streetsblog.org/2012/04/02/as-metro-wraps-up-public-outreach-on-westside-subway-beverly-hills-readies-for-a-fight/)**.

**TL;DR - A vocal, r/LosAngeles!**

**EDIT**: If you can't make the meeting

1. Send mail to David Mieger at Metro, CA, 90012.

2. Complete an online comment form at [www.metro.net/westside](http://www.metro.net/westside).

3. Send an email to WestsideExtension@metro.net.

**EDIT 2**: Breaking: The Patch is reporting that the Beverly Hills City Council may [persue legal action](http://beverlyhills.patch.com/articles/consultants-report-to-council-on-subway-routes) to prevent Metro from tunnelling under the school.  I am shocked...*shocked* at this turn of events

&gt; Thomas White, City Attorney Larry Wiener and City Manager Jeff Kolin.

&gt; ""I don't know to what extent our withdrawal of consent will be effective, no, no, you've had your chance and you've blown it.'""

So they are trying to stop one of the biggest public works projects in Los Angeles county history- one that the federal government has already chipped in a couple billion for- because they don't want a tunnel under their school?

**Citadel Outlet Mall**
[Citadel]( http://www.citadeloutlets.com/)  Ugh, Lucky Brand offer 0-10% off the regular store prices. Once I realized they are a mix of regular and discount stores I decided not to waste my time.  It is my understanding Citadel was built as an outlet mall but now is a mix of regular and discount stores. 

**American Apparel Factory Outlet**
[American Apparel] (http://www.americanapparel.net/storelocator/search.html?retailstoreid=242)   Not really a fan of the styles.  Suprised to see neon tights marked down to $10, retail shop downstairs, and outlet upstairs.  One cool thing about this site is they have a graphic artist who will print anything you want on your AA item for $10 or $15.  Not sure they will make you a Lakers or other licensed Logo but its really high tech printing not like iron on transfer.  

**JBrand Jeans**
[JBrand Jeans Outlet] (http://jbrandfactoryoutlet.com/)  Thanks to the outlet I dont own any other jeans.

**The Cooper Building**
[The Cooper Building] (http://cooperdesignspace.blogspot.com/)  Take only what you can afford to spend because the prices are so good I see people drop a few thousand on a sale that is held in a room no bigger then a 2 car garage.  

**Santee Alley**
[Santee Alley]  (http://www.thesanteealley.com/) Parking is the biggest downfall around here, accessories for Iphones, fake IDs, Pirated DVD movies (dont waste your money), and lots of cheap clothes and socks.
[Roger Stuart Clothes] (http://rogerstuart.com/) Mens clothes &amp; suits.  

**Big Warehouse Blow Outs**
[Weekend Warehouse Sales Southern California]  (http://www.warehouseweekends.com/california/southern-california/)  If you have the time and get to these sales early enough you will score.  I make a generous second income buying stuff at these sales then holding on to the goods a few months.  These are for serious shoppers, because the discounts are huge.  e.g. $200 Designer jackets are $20.  $50 tops for $10.

**Reddit Favorites**
[It's A Wrap] (http://itsawraphollywood.com/)  This is the clothing outlet for major Hollywood Studios
[Black Market]  (http://www.blackmarketla.com/) Im going to check this little gem out soon. I see artsy things for the home
[Dish Factory Outlet] (http://dishfactoryoutlet.com) Website shows current selection and prices.  [Ski Wear Outlet] (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ski-wear-outlet-santa-clarita)

**Flea Markets/Swap Meets**
[Musician Swap Meet] (http://www.musiciansswapmeet.net/) temp suspended till further notice.  [Rose Bowl Flea Market] (http://www.rgcshows.com/RoseBowl.aspx) 2nd Sunday of the month.

A lot of people don't realize the sheer amount of work that goes into planning a party for 450 people, budgeting every last thing that happened (the food was pot luck, but there was quite a bit of money spent on all the little things yesterday, so [please donate](http://redditla.com/grmud/)), and keeping track of the myriad of details that pop up in the six weeks before the event.

On day one, she oversaw all of the budgeting and planning, and she sent out daily and sometimes hourly emails to people to make this whole thing happen. She was an amazing planner and coordinator, and without her, this event would not have happened as it did. She deserves a huge amount of respect and thanks for all of us who attended.

I'll give a shout out to all the other volunteers (Dan, Jason, and Dave, everyone who helped set up, and everyone who helped tear down) who worked their butts off as well. But Margo deserves a large heaping serving of appreciation for what she did. Rather than talk about her at length when she wasn't there at the end, I figured we could do it here, so she'd have a chance to bask in the happiness and post-GrMUD glow.

Yelp the place before you go

----------------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT: Sorry I suppose I should've elaborated. 

Details - Went to this place to get some standard maintenance (oil change, but $200 labor. (I've since looked this up and it appears to be a 15 minute procedure, so shame on me for not being smart and learning my own maintenance). The door lock is busted because it needs a new actuator. 
Ok fine, I could live with it. 

We get the call the next day that the car is done, now all 4 door locks are somehow magically broken. The sales advisor tells my wife that the locks on all 4 doors have been replaced, and says, 

""Oh

WTF? Only the driver side was broken and that's not even fixed. He calls me, I don't know. 

""Oh sometimes when you fix one door it breaks another""  

When I asked to speak to a manager

So now I'm thinking, knock some money off the price for the inconvenience of having to drop the car off a second unplanned day of maintenance, not to mention the piss-poor customer service.Then the guy calls me and has the balls to say that he's willing to give me labor free on the passenger side door (that they broke), but I have to pay for the part. I call bullshit, he gets the part thrown in free, but still not making any good. I really think getting some slack cut on the $980 for this amount of incompetence and runaround is not terrible, some small gesture to patch up the relationship would've been perfectly acceptable. 

Wrapping it up I then spent 3 hours going up the chain of managers and getting runaround, that they broke. He wasn't making enough money off the deal anyway. Not a blink at the fact that they did not fix my original problem properly or on time in the first place, or that a dozen lines of bullshit had been fed to us from the Sales Advisor. 

At this point it's a case sent up to Honda Corporate

The smell of marijuana is probable cause for one to be searched; either your body

He searched my car and found less than a gram of concentrated cannabis inside my zipped backpack, still in its original labeled container.  

During the long search of my car the officer ran down my car's battery because the dome light was on the entire time.  Because the battery was dead and the windows were down the officer had my car impounded.  

After the officer found the marijuanas, and then arrested me.  He didn't verify if it was real.  He didn't call his supervisor.  He said concentrated cannabis is a felony regardless.  

I was arrested,000.  I was charged with 4 different offenses.  1) Felony possession of concentrated cannabis 2) Possession of marijuana (infraction) 3) Crossing the double yellow line (infraction) 4) Failure to stay in one's own lane (infraction).  

The next month was pretty intense.  In order to save money I decided to represent myself.  I am not an attorney.  I spoke to 8 different lawyers.  I sat down with 4 different lawyers.  I tried to get the ACLU to represent me.  (They did not).  I was told by the public defenders what I should do.  

I had to get a notarized doctor's note from my doctor.  The doctor is 86 years old and had lost his license to practice medicine since he approved me for MMJ.  It was a pain in the ass but I finally got the notarized letter.  I had to get my hearing advanced twice so I could take care of all of this before Thanksgiving.  I brought the letter into court and the prosecutor dropped all 4 charges.  It was a plea deal so in order to get the charges dropped I had to agree to forfeit all seized evidence.  

I tried to get the ACLU and a second private attorney to sue the Burbank PD for arresting a medical marijuana patient.  They could not help me.  

I was left with a ridiculous $1000 bill from the bail bondsman

I made a complaint to the Burbank watch commander because I believed it was an illegal stop, ""I encourage our officers to make these kinds of arrests.""  I was speechless.  He mentioned that he wouldn't want any kids trying concentrated cannabis.  

I told the watch commander concentrated cannabis is covered by prop 215.  He said its not.  I told him that in 2003 the attorney general said concentrated cannabis is protected under prop 215.  There are many many stores in LA that sell concentrated cannabis.  I told the watch commander that pot brownies are ""concentrated cannabis"" so would he arrest me for that?  He just smiled and laughed and would not give me a straight answer.  He said pot brownies are illegal and the FDA doesn't allow them because they are food products.  

Thanks for listening reddit.  I just wanted to vent.  This whole thing has been very traumatic for me.  I don't have emotional support from my family in this matter.  If you have any suggestions/comments I'd love to hear them. 

I'm 27 years old and its fucked up to say the only thing I have learned from this whole mess is to **NEVER SPEAK TO THE POLICE.  **

1. The traffic is bad, day or night.  Big difference, however, is that people seem to be much more respectful of traffic laws.  I see exponentially more turn signals here than I did in Miami.  I see far fewer cars running red lights or turning from non-turn lanes.  Metered highway entrances?  They tried it in Miami, no one followed the rules, so they took most of them down.  

2. Somewhat related to #1, if you walk in front of a car, that driver will make sure to hit you or at least scare you so that you learn never to do it again.  Here, people are a lot more laid back so they'll generally stop for you and let you cross.

3. The rent is *not* too damn high, it is in a much more central area. 

4. Going along with #3

5. Despite the stereotype that things are expensive in Southern California, comparably priced.  Supermarket prices?  Much cheaper.  Dining out?  Much cheaper.  Drinking?  So much cheaper it hurts me to know how much I used to spend.  Gas?  About the same, maybe a few cents more expensive in the nicer areas. 

6. People here are much more polite than in Miami.  I have had many people hold doors for me or, my students are much more respectful than they were in Miami.  The school where I teach now is, if anything, in a ""worse"" area than where I used to teach, and yet the students still have manners and know how to be respectful.  While middle schoolers are still middle schoolers, I feel like I am finally teaching humans as opposed to the beasts that Miami parents call children.

What's the point of this whole post?

It was crazy. I think I used the site a total of 4 times and only sealed the deal with one of their listings. I am in the process of building something a little different because I am also offering the ability to find roommates too www.flatscore.com best part is** it's free**. If you all hate WSR and the current options that are available as much as I have been reading on here why don't you tell me what you want so I can create it for you?

We went live a couple of months ago and have had a lot of positive feedback so far. I have been spending a lot of time on filling shared listings for finding roommates which has been super successful. Now I am interested in filling empty apartments.

[Side note] If you are in property management and want me to personally help you fill a listing PM me. I am creating custom pages for each management company but only on request. The first 10 management companies to sign up will get tons of free services including me personally helping them fill their places.  

New features coming very soon (less than a month):
*Connect with current roommates
*Split bills/rent with roommates and get notified via email when they're coming up
*Get references from past roommates
*Rate current and X # of past roommates

1364869522.0,1bhkr3,My recent trip to LA,saggy_balls,170,30,86,"I just spent a few days in LA and it was one of the best vacations I had in a long time.  I've had a strong urge to move out to LA for 2-3 years now but have been unable to find a job out there.  I was finally able to scrape together the cash for a short trip

Day 1
Went to the Griffith Observatory and checked out the view of the city.  This was actually my favorite part of the entire trip.  I live in the Philly area right now and we don't have anything that even compares to Griffith Park.  It was about 2pm on a Thursday and it was still packed - my favorite thing about LA was that people really do embrace the weather and beautiful scenery.  I saw more people walking, etc than I normally see in an entire month back in Phllly.
 
Ate shrimp burritos at Tacos Delta in Silver Lake.  This also happened to be my favorite meal of the trip.  I should have done a better job of spreading my favorite experiences out.
 
Went downtown at night and had drinks at the rooftop bar at the standard.  I can't say much about this place; I had flown in from the East Coast on an early flight

Day 2

Went on a 5 mile run when I first woke up through Los Feliz.  I got alot of good pictures there.  Beautiful area.

Drove through Beverly Hills; it was a cool experience but I didn't see as much as I expected to.

Stopped at the Saddle Ranch on the way back and drank the best Bloody Mary I ever had.  They had a few different Bloody Mary's on the menu - I can't remember the name of the one that I got

At dinner at a Vietnamese place called Blossom.  It was the first time I ever had Pho.  It was good but not great.

Went to the 4100 bar in Silver Lake and had a few beers
 
Caught a burlesque show at Harvard and Stone.  The band was great and the girls were beautiful but it was a bit of a disappointment.  We were there for almost an hour waiting for the band to start - they played 2 songs and then stopped.  We waited for another hour before leaving and they hadn't started again yet.

Stopped at some dive bar on the way home that had a free hot dog buffet.  There needs to be more places like that.

Day 3
 
Walked the boardwalk at venice and saw some of the street performers; saw the basketball courts from American History X.  
 
Walked along the venice canals.
 
Drove through Santa Monica and Malibu and up the PCH; had lunch and drinks at Duke's in Malibu (the only shitty food I had while I was here).  
 
Stopped at the Den for some drinks.  
 
Had dinner at Chateau Marmont.  Tried a bunch of food here and it was all very good
 
Drove up through the hills to Mulholland drive at night.  
 
Day 4
My last day in LA.  Pub crawl for St Patty's day.  I don't remember much from this day

LA exceeded all my expectations.  The food was great and so were the people

r/LosAngeles [RDDoS](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/day/rddos-2012/) is just a week and a half away (9/22/12). What seems to be the moon and starts aligning

Several r/LosAngelesers met a few weeks back to discuss what to do for this day and by coincidence Kelly from Create Now contacted us just a week ago about their non-profit in Los Angeles and how they've partnered with redditdonate.com

I'll let Kelly say it in her own words:

&gt; Hi

&gt; I'm the Development Assistant for Create Now, and job opportunities to help end the cycle of poverty that they're often caught up in.

&gt; We've recently partnered with Reddit Donate and would love to invite you to learn more about our organization at our website: [http://www.createnow.org](http://www.createnow.org). We've been verified through a number of channels to participate in the Reddit Donate project and can also provide additional information such as our 990 form

&gt;I think partnering with r/losangeles would make a lot of sense for us, feel free to PM /u/CreateNow.

Sunday the 23rd they also have a event called Zamfest.

&gt;Starting tomorrow, we'd love to have 20-30 people to count on to help us out! Here is the link to the 

&gt; Zamfest webpage: http://www.zamfest.com

&gt;We'll have a 20x20 tent set up with a donation station, take donations, or help assist with arts and crafts and the drum circle.

&gt; Let us know if you guys were still interested! 

If you would like to contact Kelly please email her at kelly@createnow.org.  [I have created a Meet-Up page ](http://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/82051342/) for those interested in the event so we can track volunteers and make it easier on Kelly so she isn't swarmed with emails

So there you have it r/LosAngeles. Are we ready to step for the cause? Are we ready to do something for RDDoS?And if everyone agrees I am going to put the redditdonate.com button in our sidebar! Check out /r/graphic_design as an example of the button.

Sadly, I just won't be able to be there in person.

**EDIT** This just in. If you want to be a volunteer sign up here: http://www.tfaforms.com/212588

This will be the easiest way for Create Now to keep track of the volunteers and will make sure we're covering all of our bases legally. No one will be contacted for other volunteer opportunities unless they've indicated an interest beyond Zamfest.",self,t5_2qht0,1347547894.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/zropm/official_meetup_reddit_dedicated_day_of_service/

My friend's dad went missing yesterday and we're desperately looking for him.  Here is the summary:

* **Name:** Tommy Lam
* **Age:** 64
* **Height:** 5'6""
* **Weight:** 150lbs
* **Hair:** Grey
* **Eyes:** Brown

* Missing as of 11am Wednesday August 31
* Last seen at Kaiser Permanente on Foothill Blvd in Pasadena
* Was wearing a black checkered shirt, holding Kaiser Permanente bag
* Has Alzheimers and Dementia and can not make out words other than ""yes""

* Please call the police first if you have any information (**626-744-4241**)
* I also set up the email **help.t.lam@gmail.com**

Thanks for you help.

**Edit Sept 2 8am:** Still not found yet. Sorry I don't have any new news from my friend other than that a search party is forming at the Kaiser Permanente in Pasadena (3280 E Foothill Blvd) Saturday if Tommy is not found.  130pm to 630pm.  There's a facebook event for it hosted by Lisa Lam Hraba called ""Search party needed for Tommy Lam"" but I can't post the link it because I left LA for the weekend and am doing everything from my wife's phone.

I am 18 years old, I also make arts and crafts, and I frequent Reddit and Imgur. I’m also quite short so if you cannot handle having to look down a lot, I’m sorry. (Although I will be wearing very high heels so my dress doesn’t drag)

Don't move to LA.  It's a spectacularly bad idea.  Even a tiny one bedroom apartment will run you easily $1500 a month.  This is one of the most expensive areas in the US.  Even if you have a lot of savings, where they're cutting back on everything.

If you feel adrift in Chicago, they'll afford you a solid base and hopefully you'll get health and other benefits when you land a job.  Once you have your solid base, you can work on what you're passionate about on the side.

* **Where?** **[Jillian's in Universal Citywalk](http://www.citywalkhollywood.com/dining/jillians.html)**
* **When?** 7PM most of us will be heading over immediately after
* **What?** Drinks! Lots of Drinks! At least for me, alcohol, and bowling (kinda like Dave and Busters, but Jillians)

**LAST FEW THINGS!**

* If you have not **[signed up](http://redditla.org/form.html)** yet
* If you would like to **[donate](http://redditla.org/index.html#chapter-3)** to help make this year amazing you'd be a super neat person and we'll develop an unhealthy crush on you.
* If you know of a company(or own one) that would like some exposure
* Also if you have not signed up on **[meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors)** for the **[Day Event](http://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/118578192/)** and **[Night Event](http://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/122027572/?a=ra1_te)** I suggest doing that too.

**SPEAKING OF SPONSORS!**

We have sponsors!

Earlier this week I asked for helping getting home from my abortion appointment in downtown LA. The outpouring of support and offers to help amazed and touched me.

This morning a lovely redditor picked me up outside my apartment (we checked each other out on facebook first to be safe!). She was amazing. I felt relieved and ready to be done with the process on the way.

We got there and the waiting room was packed. I checked in, then I went in for an ultrasound and the nurse told me they'd call me back in for the procedure in about half an hour.

Fifteen minutes later, and 6 months filled my head. I thought of what it would be like to feel the baby kick for the first time. I turned to my awesome companion and said ""I'm getting cold feet."" The room was freezing, so at first she thought I was speaking literally, but then immediately starting talking to me and validating my sudden feelings of dread.
I don't know what changed in those 15 minutes

Being the awesome woman she was

I went to receptionist and told her I was leaving

We talked in the car on the way home, college grads, and I'm in law school. He wants to keep it.

My message box was inundated with questions, and people looking for places to live in LA. Thank you so much for all of that! You have no idea how happy you made all of everyone working on this free product :)

Many of you loved the idea of a free West Side Rentals but had a hard time with our site because I had such few listings. I have been working on adding them since then and just added 27 new listings all verified to be scam free (Suck it Craigslist) and am in the process of getting several more. Over the next month we should be able to more than double the number of free verified listings in LA. 

Check out the new listings here (http://flatscore.com/users/view/SCRESINC)

* If you are a real estate broker that does not charge tenants for your services and would like to be on Flatscore send me a message. 

* If you are a management company and would like to market your listings for free send me a message.  

* If you are in LA and are looking for a roommate or an empty apartment message me and I will help you find a place/roommate even if what you want isn't on my site. I will do it all for the price of **free** (and I'll probably ask you to tell your pals about the experience)

EDIT: Thanks again for your overwhelming support! To clarify the link above aren't all of our listings you can find them here http://flatscore.com/places (switch between shared and empty listings at the top of the page)
