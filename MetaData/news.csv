complicated to buy.  We figured out a way.

Making my shows affordable has always been my goal but two things
have always worked against that.  High ticket charges and ticket
re-sellers marking up the prices.  Some ticketing services charge
more than 40% over the ticket price and
I've made my ticket prices
up

By selling the tickets exclusively on my site
ticket charges way down and absorbed them into the ticket price.
To buy a ticket
buy the damn thing.   opt in to the email list if you want
you'll only get emails from me.

Also
anything above the original price
your ticket (and refund your money).  this is something I intend
to enforce.  There are some other rules you may find annoying but
they are meant to prevent someone who has no intention of seeing
the show from buying the ticket and just flipping it for twice
the price from a thousand miles away.

Some of these rules may be a pain in your ass
patient.  My goal here is that people coming to see my shows are
able to pay a fair price and that they be paying just for a
ticket.  Not also paying an exhorbanant fee for the privalege of
buying a ticket.

Tickets across the board
what you'll actually pay.  In every case
anyone has actually  paid to see me (after ticket charges)  in
about two years and in most cases it's about half of what you
paid last year.

The benifit for me is that I won't get angry emails from anyone
who paid a ton of money to see me due to circumstances out of my
control.  That makes me VERY happy.  The 45 dollars also includes
sales tax
depending on the state.

Another benifit to me is also one to you.  I get your email
address (if you opt in) when you opt in.  You don't have to join
ANYTHING to buy these tickets and if you opt in
from me once in an old man's jizz-cycle.

Obviously  none of this means anything if the shows aren't good.
So that's up to me.  As I do every year
brand new hour (or more) on all of these shows.

Lastly
that could work with our exclusive ticketing service under these
perameters.  It means I'm playing in very new places.  I really
appreciate all of these theaters that are letting us give this a
try.

Setting up this tour has been fascinating and difficult.  this
ticketing service is a brand new thing and I really fucking hope
it works and that there aren't any problems.  If anything comes
up

Doing things this way means I""m making less than I would have
made if I did a standard tour
expensive ticketing service.  In some cities I've had to play
smaller venues and do more shows.  But I like doing more shows
and about a year ago I reached a place where I realized I am
making enough money doing comedy so the next thing that
interested me is bringing your price down.  Either way
make a whole lot more than my grandfather who taught math and
raised chickens in Michigan.

alright
folks on the opt-in list and sending a separate email that lays
it out much more simply with the proper links.  I am doing this
because when I emailed you about LIVE AT CARNEGIE HALL
still on sale for 5 dollars!) about half of the people who got
the email really enjoyed the long
The other half HATED it and would have preffered a price
and me shutting the fuck up.

This way
massive shit-ball of text and throw it in the garbage
on the simple email.

I hope to see you all on the road.

edit: Holy shit

Alot of people asking what happened

Zimmerman was neighborhood watch. He saw a young man in a hoodie and he thought that looked suspicious. He followed the young man, and was bashing his head into the ground. Zimmerman reached for his firearm and fired. 

[One witness was Trayvons friend/girlfriend, didn't care about Justice for Trayvon, couldn't read. She didn't even call the police when she found out he died.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mL1OFA7LPrY) 

[Another ""witness"" was a neighbor who called 911

[Some character pictures of Trayvon]- broken for now.

[Zimmermans wounds](http://imgur.com/a/FJVBv)

In the end, Zimmermans wounds, the recordings they had meant that Zimmerman was found not guilty. Didn't mean he didn't play a part. He was being trialed for Murder 2, then they realized that wasn't happening they put manslaughter on the table, Zimmermans actions didn't meet that of manslaughter to the Jury, thus found not guilty. He wasn't even going to be trialed but a bunch of people(Media+others) threw into outrage that because a ""white man"" killed a black man.(Zimmerman is half Hispanic)

Hey guys

From the Giza metro station I heard automatic gunfire and saw a huge plume of black smoke off in the distance. When I arrived

I started taking pictures as soon as I arrived

Finally someone started speaking English to me! After explaining to the crowd I was there to record and tell they're story, anything I needed.

Throughout the day I interviewed several protestors. From what I could gather the protestors are actually a mix of Morsi supporters and opposers. Those who don't support Morsi are protesting against the military who ""take our vote and throws it in the trash"". While Morsi wasn't who THEY voted for

During the interviews, these are thins I was told, I didn't witness them.

Throughout the entire day I didn't see a single weapon amongst the protestors. Everyone had rocks, I was warned by one person to ""not take pictures of protestors with weapons"". The group I was with immediately told me he was wrong, because the protestors aren't armed. So while I didn't see a single armed protestor or firing from the crowd, take it for what you will.

What I did witness, about 15 years old, missing half of his head. I'm no arms expert, but the protestors said he was shot by a sniper.

They explained that snipers were perched in the high rise and would target photographers/journalists (one was killed today). At one point five or so protestors created a human shield

Towards the end of the day, plus the camera would have definitly been destroyed. I decided to leave.
On my way back I switched out SD cards and when I arrived at the metro station I photographed some of the military tanks. They grabbed me and took the camera. I told them I was just a tourist but they forced me to delete The photos anyways.

I tried to make it as unbiased as an account as I could. While I didn't know what I was going to do with these pictures,,True,,t5_2qh3l,1376592678.0,,True

**EDIT 202 1:31:**  It's basically been a lot of officers telling each other where they are going and general communication.  Nothing new.

**EDIT 201 1:30:**  Conference starting

**EDIT 200 1:26:**  Correspondent /u/potato_bus says another [press conference](http://www.myfoxboston.com/category/262392/boston-marathon) is coming up.

**EDIT 199 1:21:**  I have heard no updates on the old man with the dead switch or the location of White Hat.  I am only listening to the scanner but I do check messages for info.

**EDIT 191 1:10:** A lot of garbled messages

**EDIT 190 1:08:**  Front door opened

**EDIT 189 1:07:**  Look if the hostage taker is reading reddit instead of listening to the scanner then he's screwing himself and we're helping the police.  

**EDIT 188 1:05:**  Attempting to contact hostage taker.

**EDIT 187 1:02:**  Possible house with hostage located.

**EDIT 176 12:42:**  About EDIT 173, but other than that the only details are unit number and specific locations.  Which is exactly what they asked not be posted.  If something happens I'll post the aftermath.  And this is the first time they specifically said on the scanner not to mention something on the air.

**EDIT 175 12:40:**  They are checking on something but not being very descriptive.

**EDIT 174 12:38:**  There will be a controlled explosion in Cambridge later in the day as a precaution.

**EDIT 173 12:35:**  They just said something that they don't want on air.  Don't write a comment about it.

**EDIT 172 12:34:**  I'm still listening to the scanner and not the press conference so if anything new comes out in the conference please let me know.

**EDIT 171 12:33:**  EOD team being sent to another location.

**EDIT 170 12:29:**  /u/potato_bus posts link to upcoming [press conference](http://www.myfoxboston.com/category/262392/boston-marathon).  Police are very concerned about the security for the conference

**EDIT 169 12:27:**  Open basement door that is being checked out.

**EDIT 165 12:15:**  As you've probably seen

**EDIT 164 12:13:**  Press conference should be sometime soon.

**EDIT 162 12:05:**  For those asking there have not been any recent updates on Suspect #2 (White Hat)

**EDIT 161 12:02:**  Suspect is ""clear""

**EDIT 160 12:01:** Numerous people from different areas have reported loss of power.  (Power outages were reportedly due to construction.)

**EDIT 159 12:00:**  /u/greenlep posted a different link to a ~~possible twitter~~ for Suspect #2 (White Hat).  Take it with a grain of salt

**EDIT 158 11:56:**  Still working on the old suspect

**EDIT 157 11:55:**  Apparently the ""jumper"" was not a person

**EDIT 156 11:52:**  /u/riothedragonman lives near the area where the jumper was reported and says everyone has dispersed.

**EDIT 155 11:51:**  Someone asked

**EDIT 154 11:47:**  Four robots operating on the old man right now.  No word on device or explosive.

**EDIT 153 11:45:**  Press conference will begin soon

**EDIT 152 11:44:**  One area that was previously being investigated is clear.  Not the old man or jumper scene.

**EDIT 151 11:39:**  Second bearcat is arriving at the original scene with the old man.

**EDIT 150 11:35:**  They are doing police stuff that doesn't need to be reported.

**EDIT 149 11:30:**  An EOD team is being called to the overpass

**EDIT 148 11:28:**  Possible jumper on an overpass.

**EDIT 147 11:26:**  Because it keeps getting asked.  The suspect that is being searched by the EOD robots, is a 60-70 yr old gray haired man.  He was specifically identified as having salt and pepper hair, even the age 90 was thrown out.  This is NOT White Hat aka Suspect #2

**EDIT 146 11:24:**  Investigating possible sighting of suspect #2 at different location.  (Most likely a false sighting

**EDIT 145 11:23:**  Unknown car has stopped within a security perimeter.

**EDIT 144 11:22:**  They said they need to bring in a second EOD robot and a second Bearcat (armored vehicle)

**EDIT 143 11:19:**  EOD robot is still clearing the suspect.  He will be interviewed after he is cleared.

**EDIT 142 11:18:**  Officials are supposed to give any update some time soon.

**EDIT 138 11:07:**  Been silent

**EDIT 137 11:03:**  To further clarify

**EDIT 135 11:01:**  Negotiating with suspect (not white hat).

**EDIT 134 11:00:**  Apparently EDIT 126/128 was not clear.  This is not Suspect #2 aka White Hat.

**EDIT 133 10:59:**  Guessing they are still waiting on EOD.

**EDIT 132 10:53:**  ~~Hearing ""man down"" in the background

**EDIT 132 10:52:** Making attempts to block a possible blast.

**EDIT 131 10:51:**  Suspect is shaking his head ""no"" and trying to arch his back up

**EDIT 130 10:47:**  He has something in his right hand that he holding.  Last person had a dead man switch.  (If someone lets go of a dead man switch it triggers the mechanism)

**EDIT 129 10:46:**  Some people are saying they heard reports of a shot fired.

**EDIT 128 10:45:**  Waiting on EOD to move further.  Still no information on if the older man held at gunpoint has any relation to Boston Suspect #2.  Has anyone heard how they originally found him or if he approached officers?

**EDIT 127 10:44:** Suspect is being held at gunpoint and is in handcuffs.

**EDIT 126 10:40:** Waiting on mod position.  A different suspect may be found, 60-70 yrs old.  Brown jacket, device is in jacket.

**EDIT 125 10:39:**  It has been brought to my attention that the Boston PD has been asking that people do not post information from the scanner online.  As of now I will reduce updates only to information that either they want people to know (like the CRV info) or that can not compromise them at all.  Or stuff that is already on national news

**EDIT 124 10:25:**  Some guy just dropped a hockey duffle bag by ""Save the Harbor Save the Bay"" and left

**EDIT 122 10:22:**  Looking at a red Crown Victoria now.

**EDIT 121 10:20:**  CRV was apparently found empty.

**EDIT 120 10:18:**  They say they have or have seen some possible suspects who look Russian.  ""We have him with us.""  Not entirely sure the specific.  I don't think it's the actual suspect

**EDIT 119 10:15:** Still looking for 1999 Grey Honda CRV License # 316 ES9 (thanks

**EDIT 118 10:13:**  Pretty slow going right now.  Just making sure everything is in order.

**EDIT 317: 7:31PM** Want to keep updating everyone each minute.  Still radio silence.  Completely dead on the radio.  
**EDIT 316: 7:30PM** Two choppers in the air (according to whatever news station I have on TV - NOT THE SCANNER) with infrared cameras.  
**EDIT 315: 7:29PM** Still mumblings about dogs and weapons
**EDIT 314: 7:28PM** Suspect is in the boat and he has a wire fence behind him.  Trying to decipher chatter here as quickly as I can.  Sorry if I miss something.  
**EDIT 313: 7:27PM** One friendly is ""a little too close"" to the boat.  Asking them to leave.  
**EDIT 312: 7:26PM** ""Suspect prone""  Not sure if I heard that right.  There is still movement in the back of the boat.  
**EDIT 311: 7:26PM** They are attempting to come up with an official dog to track down the suspect in case he gets out of the boat.  FBI dog versus BPD dog?  I pick the FBI dog.  
**EDIT 310: 7:25PM** Tactical folk trying to get up on a wall for either entry or line of sight.  They have a K9 unit on hand as well.  
**EDIT 309: 7:23PM** ""Clear the air.  Let's maintain radio silence.""  ""OK boss
**EDIT 308: 7:22PM** ""Keep going dispatch
**EDIT 307: 7:22PM** All non-tactical policemen are asked to leave the area.  Those with the best weapons are in place and they want them to have the best view of the incident.  
**EDIT 306: 7:21PM** [This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1cpb55/live_boston_update_thread_part_7/c9ir3y9) filled in while I was gone.  THANK YOU!  
**EDIT 286: 7:19PM** The backyard has been cleared of all officers and civilians in case of crossfire.  Apparent standoff situation - will continue to update quickly.  The scanner is very busy.  
**EDIT 285: 7:17PM** If the boat is in fact opened
**EDIT 284: 7:16PM** All non-essential officers are being asked to set up a perimeter.  They are ripping off something...not sure what.  I think he is hiding in a boat.
**EDIT 283: 7:16PM** Garage is clear.  I have a scanner up and I will update by the moment from here on out until the conclusion.  
**EDIT 282: 7:15PM** Shots fired.  Suspect possibly down.  Ambulance being backed in.  ""All police officers form all commands in the rear of that white garage behind the house need to move.  You are in the line of fire.""   
**EDIT 281: 7:14PM** Stupid traffic...sorry guys.  Police and FBI have tracked down a car. Shots fired at 7:09.  EOD on scene.
**EDIT 280: 6:49PM** Since the scanners aren't working for me here at work
**EDIT 279: 6:46PM** Reports of a suspect in custody.  No description, or anything else.  I can not even hint at it being the primary suspect.  
**EDIT 278: 6:45PM** I have been sent a recording of the potential high speed chase by /u/That_Urks_Me and it seems as plausible as the other scanner audio I have found.  Thank you to everyone that has sent me scanner links
**EDIT 277: 6:42PM** Mention of a possible runner.  (This was potentially of a recorded audio - apologies)  
**EDIT 276: 6:40PM** Unconfirmed reports of high speed chase matching a vehicle description.  My scanners are all down so I think it's a good time for me to run home and find a new one.  Staying for a little while longer in case something happens.  
**EDIT 275: 6:37PM** Delayed edit from 6:32 from /u/extrasweettea ""Male on bike wearing all black with curly hair seen on bike going towards central square with large backpack.. Units deployed.""  
**EDIT 274: 6:34PM** My scanner went down so I'm looking for a new one.  **PLEASE REFRAIN FROM POSTING SCANNER LINKS.** Also
**EDIT 273: 6:28PM** More questions about civilians entering the streets and how to handle the situation.  Questions about traffic patterns and allowable areas are being discussed.  
**EDIT 272: 6:24PM** Possible sighting of the suspect in **[REDACTED]**.  Police are sending units to investigate.  
**EDIT 271: 6:23PM** Police on **[REDACTED]** street say that federal agents and other agencies are falling back and the perimeter is getting sparse.  
**EDIT 270: 6:18PM** Delayed edit from 6:12 from /u/extrasweettea ""Vehicle was left with clerk after being given $20 to park it in unknown parking lot. Was told someone would come by at 10 to pick it up. No keys were left.""  
**EDIT 269: 6:16PM** Suspicious knapsack found.  EOD requested.  Unsure of location but I believe Watertown.  
**EDIT 268: 6:15PM** Police are seeing people leaving their houses and requesting how to act.  Police recommended to stand down and continue breaking down the perimeter but stay on alert.  
**EDIT 267: 6:13PM** Breaking down the perimeter.  Police are asked to stand down (in shifts) and head back to the staging area for rest and debriefing.  
**EDIT 266: 6:10PM** Public transit is back open and the ""stay indoors request"" has been lifted.  
**EDIT 265: 6:09PM** Drawing back TAC teams
**EDIT 264 6:04PM:** Backpack possibly containing umpire equipment.  Could be separate suspicious package.  
**EDIT 263 6:03 PM:** Requesting officers over 18 hours to once again be replaced.  
**EDIT 262 5:58 PM:**  Backpack spotted in metal box.  EOD and K9 team requested. No information about location (eg. Boston/Cambridge etc.)

MOVING OVER HERE BECAUSE THIS IS GETTING LAGGY AND I DON'T WANT TO MESS IT UP AGAIN.


**EDIT 362: 8:33PM** Please continue to keep the comments slow or stop them completely.  It will help this page load quicker.  Officers discussing tactical movements that I will again not discuss.  
**EDIT 361: 8:30PM** I am currently on the Rt.9 scanner (NO LINKS PLEASE) and looking at the Eastern Mass scanner.  'H4' apparently is apparently the Boston based command post.  
**EDIT 360: 8:29PM** An ambulance is blocking something
**EDIT 359: 8:26PM** Officers asking for cold water.  I'm looking at a new scanner right now so we'll see if that is more active.  
**EDIT 358: 8:25PM** Police told to stay at their post until 2100.  Not sure what will happen at 9:00PM but they will fall back to ""H4""  
**EDIT 357: 8:23PM** Chatter about a larger perimeter perhaps beyond the smaller one.  Talking about offramps and highway codes.  
**EDIT 356: 8:22PM** I am still on the BPD scanner
**EDIT 355: 8:19PM** Still see imaging in the boat - from what I heard a bit ago but wanted to update.  Suspect is still in the boat.  TV broadcast speculating he's been in the boat for quite some time.  
**EDIT 354: 8:19PM** People jumping over the gate in the back.  Possibly officers
**EDIT 353: 8:16PM** Apparently the downlink is the video - not the scanner.  I am just writing what I hear as quickly as possible and not filtering what I hear.  There are officers looking for help with keeping the population off the streets.  
**EDIT 352: 8:15PM** Asking for a new
**EDIT 351: 8:14PM** The BPD is talking about how the downlink is being thrown on the internet.  They might shut it down.  They are concerned about it being broadcast and are possibly moving channels.  Once more pass with the chopper before it refuels.  
**EDIT 350: 8:13PM** Possibly the main issue with the sun moving to the boat is that it is on the helicopter.  
**EDIT 349: 8:11PM** The main issue with the boat seems to be the fuel on board.  They are not sure if the suspect has anything flammable on him that can ignite the fuel onboard.  More discussion about tactical movements that I will not discuss.  
**EDIT 348: 8:10PM** Another request to put the ""night sun"" on the boat.  Still met with some resistance.  
**EDIT 347: 8:09PM** Still discussing safety issues with lighting up the boat.  Also, I already read the first 75.  
**EDIT 346: 8:08PM** ""The FBI would like you to put the sun on the boat.  Take all precautions if you can't do it.""  ""OK Standby""  
**EDIT 345: 8:07PM** ""Can you light up the boat?""  ""That is a negative sir
**EDIT 344: 8:05PM** ""We have movement.  Arms are moving.  Repeat
**EDIT 343: 8:04PM** I've been told by everyone that it's flameless OC paper
**EDIT 342: 8:03PM** I want to apologize again for the mixup between thread 7 and thread 8.  There is still little talk over the radio.  Apparently it's freaking snowing outside my window...GO HOME CHICAGO WEATHER! YOU'RE DRUNK!  Really...no radio chatter on my feed.  
**EDIT 341: 8:02PM** ATF is negotiating with someone
**EDIT 340: 7:59PM** Talking about flameless copy paper?  No idea why...maybe they're trying to refill their cash register.  Humor over and out.  Still nothing new to report.  Asking about TAC communication with the FBI.  
**EDIT 339: 7:59PM** Asking how the long rifles are holding up.  First mention of potential sniper cover.  Can't confirm
**EDIT 338: 7:58PM** Still negative movement.  Suspect on his back in the boat without movement.  
**EDIT 337: 7:57PM** Discussing a changeover for something.  Potentially the chopper or possibly the TAC squads.  Unsure at the moment - will update with info.  
**EDIT 336: 7:56PM** No further movement.  News stations reporting blood on the boat.  Nothing about blood on the scanner.  
**EDIT 335: 7:56PM** Officers asked to shut off lights on cruisers.  Unsure why.  They're slowly being shut down.  Still no movement.  No more flashbangs or shots fired at the moment.  
**EDIT 334: 7:55PM** Discussion of a plan.  Plan not mentioned over scanner.  Using codes and allusions to talk about the plan.  
**EDIT 333: 7:54PM** All quiet on the scanner.  
**EDIT 332: 7:53PM** Negative on the fire confirmed by the chopper.  Still no movement from the top.  
**EDIT 331: 7:52PM** Negative on the fire on the boat.  From tactical vantage point
**EDIT 330: 7:52PM** News outlets reporting ""pop pop"" noises.  Those would be the flashbangs.  Inquiry about the fire on the boat has been posted.  Awaiting a response.  
**EDIT 329: 7:50PM** Flash bang hit forward of the subject.  No movement from the subject by confirmed hit of flashbang.  
**EDIT 328: 7:50PM** Still radio silence.  Fire on the boat appears to be confirmed by scanner
**EDIT 327: 7:49PM** Boston BEARCAT asked to back up as they need access to something.  Not sure what.  
**EDIT 326: 7:48PM** All units asked for radio silence once more.  Told to not return fire as another flash bang is being fired into the center of the boat.  (Sorry again for the mess up with threads everyone)  
**EDIT 325: 7:46PM** FBI shooting off a flashbang.  Everyone told DO NOT RETURN FIRE.  
**EDIT 324: 7:45PM** Possible fire on the boat.  Unsure of the origin but there is a possible fire on the boat.  There is a tac team with a Bearcat waiting to move in but there are currently conflicting plans.  
**EDIT 323: 7:44PM** Sorry for the confusion.  I got locked out of /r/news for a little bit.  ""We do NOT want to light up the boat.  Not lights on the boat please.""  
**EDIT 322: 7:43PM** He is on the boat.  Center mass is leaned towards the fence line.  He is inside the stern - or maybe the gastank is inside the stern.  Half full tank with 20 gallons of fuel.  Unsure if the suspect is trying to get to it.  
**EDIT 321: 7:42PM** Confirmed movement in the boat from multiple sources.  Confirmed movement in the boat.  
**EDIT 320: 7:40PM** There is a full tank on the boat.  20 gallons of fuel on the boat.  Helicopters overhead say there is movement in the boat.  Asking for spotlights on the boat.  
**EDIT 319: 7:40PM** There is quite a bit of movement in the boat.  He is sitting up and moving.  
**EDIT 318: 7:39PM** SORRY!  It wouldn't let me make a new post in /r/news so I had to make one here.  I don't know why.  
**EDIT 317: 7:32PM** They are working to meet up around the back of the house.  They almost have the top of the boat ripped off.

---
The suspect is in custody and is confirmed as the 19 year old brother in the Boston Marathon Bombing.  He **IS ALIVE** but is severely wounded.  He is being treated for wounds as I write this.  I want to thank everyone for the kind words, and be proud tonight for the swift end to this ordeal.

---

**9:01PM**

The commissioner just spoke saying thank you to all of the PD of Boston

""It is a proud day to be from Boston""


---

I tried to respond to every one that messaged me saying thank you but in case I missed you, or to anyone else in America, or the world for that matter.  I am touched by all of your kind words, offers of pizza, and gold, and thank you again for keeping me company while writing these final updates.

We owe a great thanks to /u/cedargrove and /u/JPDeathBlade as well.  I merely latched on for the final three threads

---


**EDIT 384: 8:56PM** Everyone is clearing out and finalizing movement out.  I am going to believe that the suspect is alive at the moment as they continue to refer to him ""in custody"" rather than ""deceased"".  Just my personal opinion and that means nothing.  They are currently organizing the return of all weapons to the appropriate jurisdictions.  I think we're all done here.  ""Good job boys.""  
**EDIT 383: 8:55PM** ""APP TO ALL BOSTON POLICE - WE HAVE OUR SECOND SUSPECT OF THE BOSTON MARATHON BOMBING IN CUSTODY  -  REPEAT  -  THE SECOND SUSPECT IS IN CUSTODY.""  
**EDIT 382: 8:53PM** Thanks is going around to the TAC squads, everyone seems to feel this part of the ordeal is over.  
**EDIT 381: 8:52PM** ""Great job""  
**EDIT 380: 8:51PM** Every suspect is being questioned
**EDIT 379: 8:50PM** Officers are continuing to the sweep the area.  
**EDIT 378: 8:49PM** All residents being asked to return back to their houses to clear the street.  Potential helicopter lift for the suspect.  Unsure once again.  Apologies for waffling.  Asking to clear the street for the ""victim"".  Don't know what to make out of that.   
**EDIT 377: 8:48PM** Suspect is once again confirmed in custody.  That makes me feel he is still alive
**EDIT 376: 8:47PM** Confirmed once more - suspect is in custody.  Conflicting reports about suspect being dead and suspect being treated by an EMS.  I will not make any claims to either point.  They are still calling an ambulance.  
**EDIT 375: 8:46PM** Cheers from the crowd heard as scanners reported they have the man in custody.  WE HAVE NO IDEA IF THIS IS THE 19 YEAR OLD WHITE HAT.  
**EDIT 374: 8:45PM** I am still on local Boston scanner and can't get the Eastern Mass one to work but it appears they have him in custody.  
**EDIT 373: 8:44PM** Local Boston media reporting suspect is captured and alive
**EDIT 372: 8:43PM** Probably not about the suspect in the boat - talking about the EOD unit in Watertown.  
**EDIT 371: 8:43PM** Suspect might be about the black bag.  No clues.  
**EDIT 370: 8:42PM** ""MEDIC! MEDIC!""  Chilling cry.  
**EDIT 369: 8:42PM** Suspect in custody but NO ONE INSIDE OF PERIMETER  
**EDIT 368: 8:40PM** Media was ordered off the roof
**EDIT 367: 8:39PM** Abandoned black bag outside in the city of Boston.  Not located near the episode going on.  It is actually in Watertown not Boston.  Proceeding EOD.  
**EDIT 366: 8:39PM** Asking all police in the outer perimeter to hold fast and be prepared.  
**EDIT 365: 8:38PM** 110 comments in 2 minutes... /facepalm  
**EDIT 364: 8:36PM** Talking about grabbing rifle shields and meeting up with FBI TAC.  Police have been ordered off the roof

I went to Kathleen visitation today (1/13/12) and expressed the condolences of the Reddit community and the world to the dad and family.  They won't admit it, and will ensure that all funds donated there make it to the family for the funeral costs.  I hate to ask for more help for these guys, but with the national media chasing this story and the number of people from the area coming to the viewing and funeral tomorrow this is not a cheap affair.  Thank you one and all for anything you can spare! And thank you all who have already donated.

EDIT: 

Since this has now hit the press

Kathleen fell a few days ago, and that was the last straw. She went pretty quickly after that. She was so tiny due to the HD, and was already pretty weak.  Her dad called me last night about 10:20pm to tell me, and I knew immediately when I saw the caller ID what the call was before I answered.  He was, of course, completely and totally a wreck.  He thanked me for everything I'd done for the family - and I want to pass on to reddit that I didn't really do anything - you guys did.  So, the thanks goes to so many of you.

----
  
This afternoon, government, and citizen alike; I can't say what the highest number was but I personally witnessed sixty thousand people listen in on scanners over the internet. With contradicting information coming from all over, places like reddit have done a superb job of disseminating and organizing information, helping establish aid for those who need it, and otherwise being a calm voice in an otherwise hectic disaster. In this thread I will begin by laying out fact versus speculation, and then provide the resources available at this time.
  
As it is a constantly developing story
  
----
  
###The story as it stands
    
**Casualties**
  
As of the hospital press briefing, one child of eight, Martin Richard. The second victim is Krystle Campbell, age 29. The third, a woman aged 23 is a student at Boston University. Family has now okay'ed her identification so I will say that her name is Lingzi Lu.
  
There is a photograph of two women lying on the ground having their pulse checked
  
Jeff
  
**The bombs**
  
There have been two bombs
  
Official reports state that the bombs were ""probably"" pressure cookers, it is accepted that the bombs were 6L pressure cookers stuffed with ball bearing and nail shrapnel. A circuit board has been recovered that may expose how the bombs were set off; the FBI has not come to any conclusions on the matter and have not commented further. Note that the only ""official"" information we have is that these bombs were ""probably"" pressure cookers, so under no circumstance is this summary set in stone.
  
Images of evidence from the blast: http://www.reuters.com/article/slideshow/idUSBRE93G04T20130417
  
During the event there was worry about cell service shutting down; this could be due to a fear of the bombs set off by phone, police are still recommending that you text rather than call, just in case.
  
Also during the event
  
On the afternoon of the 17th, however, the federal courthouse building was given it's first ever Code Red. Bomb squads rushed to the scene and the harbor was locked down by authorities in boats. The bomb scare proved to be a false alarm.
  
The risin events from the morning of the 17th were unrelated to the bombings.
  
**Suspects**
  
**Photos of Persons of Interests are now up on http://fbi.gov. Send tips to http://bostonmarathontips.fbi.gov or call 1800-CALL-FBI if you know anything. Do NOT try to aprehend or contact these individuals yourself.**
  
The investigation has now become one of national focus. The FBI is now responsible for the investigation, there is only one source for this so I would hesitate to confirm it.
  
Specialists are coming in to investigate the video evidence.
  
The crime zone in Copley Square was initially 15 blocks, the apartment was a dead end for investigation; the resident was a victim of the blast, not a suspect. The city will be covered by more security, with more wary authorities as well as presence from national and federal investigators. The MBTA will conduct random bag searches.
  
The story of the Saudi national has been a hive of misinformation so I'll try to clear that up as best as I can: a Saudi national may or may not have been detained, official reports denied any arrests; however, rumors of guarded patients continued into the night. Some time the 16th there were claims that if this Saudi national was detained to begin with he was found innocent and released. Official reports have denied holding him, and have made mention that police presence in hospitals is specifically for asking eyewitness reports.
  
On an individual level, this may still very well be an attack conducted by an organization rather than an individual. Furthermore, we do not know whether or not this is a domestic or international issue. This is likely, though unconfirmed, to be a terrorist attack, and at this point I would like to make a statement of clarification due to some comments: terrorism by definition has no need to be based in agendas or political ideology.
  
On the 17th, let alone any information on their locations. Later that day, CNN jumped the gun on a possible arrest. Other news broadcasts used CNN as a source and the rumor spread across news media. Skeptics called to question the legitimacy of the source, and with no response it became clear that this assumption was on shaky ground. Boston police [later denied](https://twitter.com/Boston_Police/status/324591574807891968) that any arrests have been made.

Edit: original video that started it all http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfsQhtEvH7g

Before Bill Nye gets a chance to speak she discredits him

Some people are saying it could have been her producer feeding her lines. I still hold her responsible. As a journalist she could have stood her ground and said she wasn't going to make false statements. She is a TV personality

Also shit rolls down hill and [""gripes go up""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IGEs_j590g&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=94s). We bitch to her, etc.  I see no problem in calling her out on HER actions. If she was really a pupet she has the choice to come out and say so. 

Edit 2: Im getting a few PM's calling me a scum bag for posting personal information.  

Here is my reply:

*That wasn't personal info
She is a TV personality and on her own segment she says: ""tell me what you think on my twitter and on my facebook"" She has links to her twitter and facebook on screen all the time.
I did not post her personal Facebook
If media personalities want to use the internet to push their agendas then they have to deal with the consequences

*Also on a personal level I minored in journalism and frankly am quite sick of what's become of modern day journalism. No one does research any more they just discuss talking points and buzz words
