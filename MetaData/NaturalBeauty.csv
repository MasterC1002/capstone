**1. You can be allergic to natural ingredients as well.**

Remember that natural *don't* equal ""safe-and-wonderful-for-everyone"". You can still get rashes and blemishes from natural products the same way you can from commercial ones. It's very common to get those little pimple-ish things (don't know what they're called in english

The good part is that if you make the products yourself

**2. Essential oils seems harmless and useless for the illiterate

*Never* use EOs directly on the skin (the exception is said to be Tea Tree, unless you perfectly know what you're doing (you *can* put them in food and use them for inhaling when you're coughing etc, but **don't do that if you're not completly sure what you're doing**.

EOs are very high concentrated and have a lot of highly therapeutical properties. If you have dry skin - use one that is good for dry skin and not one that is good for oily skin. If you have sensetive skin

Also remember that a lot of oils has anti bacterial properties; tea tree, that is.

**3. Preservatives *can* be better than rubbing mold into your skin. Also - vitamines

When you use pure oils, *is making the temperature change too often*. Of course it doesn't matter if you choose to keep them in the refrigerator and a month later decide to keep them in your bathroom. Just don't move them back and forward.

If you do keep your oils in the bathroom, but it's an *antioxidant*. That means that it's easier to break down then the oil itself, so when the oxygen comes to the oil it will ""attack"" the vE first and *then* the oil (Disclaimer: English is, as you probably have understood already, not my main language, I can explain this a lot better in my main language. If you're interested, try doing a simple googling about it) 

If you use something with water in it

Remember that most preservatives are considered safe if used in a small amount. When the factories make makeup and skinproducts, they need a loooot of preservatives. When you make skinproducts yourself, you often only make for the next month or so, that only requires liiiiittle amounts of preservatives. 

If you're 100% against preservatives

You can read a lot more about what *kind* of preservatives and antioxidants on the internet. I will not go into that here.

Having recently discovered how awesome unrefined shea butter is (especially as a previous acne sufferer) I wanted to open up some dialog about shea butter brands. 

I first got into shea butter with [NOW](http://www.amazon.com/NOW-Foods-Shea-Butter-7-Ounce/dp/B000F4J8VI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362540029&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=now+shea+butter) brand shea butter, soft, and has no smell. I initially bought it because it was cheaper at my local market than what I later learned is unrefined (better) shea butter. 

Now brand shea butter was not bad, probably because it doesn't contain all of the skin healing properties of shea butter. I also noticed that my acne didn't clear up very much when using this shea butter as a moisturizer - although it didn't get any worse, either. 

I moved on to [Alaffia](http://www.amazon.com/Alaffia-Handcrafted-Butter-Unscented-butter/dp/B002L2E9AW/ref=sr_1_sc_1?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362540122&amp;sr=1-1-spell&amp;keywords=alaffia+shea+btuter) shea butter, and sustainable (per their labeling). The difference between it and the NOW (refined) shea butter was astounding. It smells nutty and smokey (which I love), it has a much darker tan color, and it's pretty solid, I have to scrape some off the top and melt it between my fingers before I apply it to my skin, but once it soaks in there's no residual greasy feeling. I have no doubt that this is indeed unrefined shea butter. My skin looks amazing, the lines that usually mark under my eyes and at the corners of my mouth don't seem to appear mid-day like they used to

Today my [Mountain Rose Herbs](http://www.mountainroseherbs.com/butter/butter.php#but_but_s) shea butter arrived ($8/8oz). I expected it to be dark and solid like the Alaffia shea butter, very soft and extremely grainy. From what I have read this means it may have been improperly heated and cooled - which concerns me. It has a glorious nutty aroma and sinks right into my skin leaving no greasy residue, but I am concerned that it may not be truly unrefined, and certainly not raw as they claim. 

I'd like to know if anyone has any thoughts on these,False,self,t5_2s4dv,False,,n8,t3_19r4le

I had made a kind of experimental deodorant a while back but I altered my recipe and have used it for the past day or two and it works SO well! I'm shocked. The other stuff I made only worked for about 4hrs...

**My recipe is:**
* Coconut oil
* Beeswax
* Vitamin E oil (preservative)
* Tea tree oil (preservative and anti-smell-bad-stuff)
* Scented oils (natural oil perfumes I bought at a festival)
* Baking soda (helps make this recipe semi-antiperspirant)

The beeswax to oil ratio was a lot different than lotions. Between the amount of beeswax I used and the baking soda it was almost as thick as an actual thing of store bought deodorant.

Melt the wax and coconut oil and mix well.

Add the vit. e oil

Turn the heat off and add baking soda. I added about 1/8 cup for 1/2 cup's worth of melted oil-wax if I recall correctly.

Let it cool juuust enough to be thick then put it in your mold. I actually used an old washed our deodorant container.

Let set and cool overnight! :)

I had really bad blackheads all throughout my teen age years and nothing ever helped. This oil cleanse sort of takes some time but it really works great so it's worth it. I noticed big changes in a week. I would imagine it would work just fine as a cleanser for you lucky people without blackheads as well.

in a 1/2-1 oz. glass jar:

1 part castor oil

2 parts organic extra virgin olive oil

4 drops tea tree oil

4 drops rose-hip seed essential oil 

1 drop lavender essential oil

(optional

Give it a good shakin' before use. Wet your face. Then, then rub into face in all sorts of different motions and directions. This lets the oil really get deep into your skin, pushing all the bad stuff out. If you have troubled areas, spend more time rubbing that area. I do this for 5-7 minutes, or until my skin feels very tight. Next I wet a wash cloth with warm/hot water and put it on my face, until the wash cloth turns cool. I repeat this 4-6 times. After this, wet the wash cloth and very gently wipe your face until it is no longer oily.

I've found it doesn't dry my face out or make it any oilier than normal!

EDIT: I've be scolded in another subreddit for suggesting lemon in this recipe. One drop, learn about photo-toxicity and essential oils. Also I forgot to add that you should do this once a day. At night or morning. If you do this at night, give your face a gentle wipe with a damp washcloth in the morning, and vice-versa.  And valentinedoux (in the comments) is correct, hot water may dry out your skin. Use warm. I have not found that hot water dries out my skin but I also use a moisturizer.

1356045568.0,1570et,List of things to put in a facial mask ,horseniss,28,3,6,"**THINGS FROM YOUR KITCHEN**

**Fruits and berries**

Almost all fruits and berries can be used for facialmasks

Dry skin: Avocado

Oily skin: Pineapple, pear

Lemon is also a good thing to but in a facial mask

*A little extra that's not really a facial mask but can be used at the same time: Tomatoes can be used as facial scrubs

**Herbs**

Almost all herbs has healing and neutrulizing propertys, rosemary, basil, etc. Just use what you have home(just try to use raw herbs and not herb-mixes, so you know exactly what you put on your skin)!

If you have problem with acne

If you have dry skin

You can use fresh herbs, because too much glycerine on the skin will get sticky.

**Stachs**

Since I make all my facialmasks with clay

Both potatostach, that is also very good for the skin.

More things to thicken with is under ""things to make the mask thicker"".

**Other kitchen things**

Eggs. If you have dry skin that needs to be moisturized

Honey is an incredible softener

Yogurt works calming for the skin, xantangum, guar, etc). Cream can also be used for dry skin.


**OTHER INGREDIENTS TO USE**

**Things to make the mask thicker**

I've already mentioned starchs and ground oatmeal, the skin won't be able to absorb the ingredients!

Xantangum is what you use to make gel, but for my hairmasks I often use a little bit of this.

Other things to use like this is cellulosa

**Emulsifiers**

If you use any emulsifier

**Different types of clay**

Rassoulclay is very cleansing (it's awesome to use both as schampo and a bodycleaner) so if you feel like you really need to get your face washed, but since I really love it I felt like I wanted to mention it anyway. And of course you *can* make a facialmask out of it.

The different clays have different colors:

The **red** clay is good for normal skin.

The **white** clay (Kaolin) is good for sensetive skin.

The **green** clay is good for oily skin.

The **pink** clay is good for dry skin.

**Moisturizers**

Glycerin is a great moisturizer for both hair and skin

Sorbitol can replace glycerine.

Silk protein is protective and good for the cold season etc

Sodium Lactate is another great moisturizer

Lactic acid can also be used

**Vitamines**

Vitamine E is very good for the skin

**Seaweed**

I personally don't use seaweed so I really don't have much to write here, write a comment and I'll add it*)

**Oils**

Don't put too much oil in a facial mask

I'm not going to write too much about each oil here, feel free to ask because I know a lot about them. And also, of course there is a lot of other oils, I just thought I should mention the most commonly used.

Oils for a dry skin: Olive, almond, peachseed

Oils for a oily skin: Jojoba, thistle (I love thistleoil even if i don't have oily skin), hempseed

Oils for a mixed skin: Almond, sesame

**Essential oils**

*What it's used for*: Added in as a skin and hair conditioner. 
 It adsorbs (sticks) on to the outer cuticle of hair and forms a film on the hair which smoothes down the cuticle. It lubricates the hair and is thought to contribute to easier wet combing (i.e less friction). In hair serum, silicones build up on the hair and can only be adequately removed with sulfates. Sulfates are extremely drying to the hair, and can cause a whole host of problems with hair health. It is best to avoid silicones in hair care, so as to avoid sulfates in hair care. 

In skincare, its known for creating a subtle gloss that feels smooth and silky to touch. It also acts a mild water repellent by forming a protective barrier on the skin, and can fill in fine lines/wrinkles on the face, giving it a temporary “plump” look.

I know aromatherapy and essential oils are becoming more popular

I have this similar post, so here it is! With more to wrap your brain around.

Just for the record

I am supplying the information I received from an aromatherapy weekend course, blends ideas accountable for anything. Everything is at your own risk. You should always consult a certified aromatherapist if you are looking to use EO for medicinal use. They can be very dangerous if you don't know the specificity for each oil. There are some oils that cannot be used with pregnant ladies, certain diseases/conditions. Skin sensitivities can be a hazard as well.

If you are planning to use essential oils on your own

First I want to start by saying

There are many factors that can determine whether or not you are getting legit good grade essential oils. Once you read through this post

**3 models of aromatherapy** 

**-** German emphasises inhalation of EO

**-** British is very conservative

**-** French proactive and support NEAT (direct skin use). Rely strongly on scientific studies

**3 Factors to grow the best crop** – Take into consideration for purchasing essential oils (EO)

**-** grown with no pollution.

**-** Harvested properly. Only oil pockets should be harvested not the whole plant.

**-** Harvested when yield is highest.

**Facts about Essential oils you may not know:**

 - A bottle of EO only needs 3-5% of actually essential oil to be labeled 'pure' which is why its important to research the brands quality.

Oil pockets are specific to each plant they are found in. A plant grown one place will be different to another.

CO2 extracted – not for medicinal use

Steam extracted – is the best. You should only purchase and use this.

Allergic reactions to scents usually come from synthesized material used in place of oil. 

All plants have their own antidotes

Sandalwood tree grows 50 years before it can be harvested. Forest fires have limited the production of this EO.

*It's always nice to incorporate a drop of a persons 'essence' into their blend. Eg; a showy person


**Quality control** 
*What to look for and ask to see when buying oils. If the seller doesn’t have the information

**Botanical name** – normally on the front of the bottle ie. Basil (Ocimum basilicum) Always *Always* Make sure to check the botanical name, the regular lavendar you know is called lavendar officinalis, but there is also a Lavendar lespica.. it smells different and is used for a stimulant (complete opposites!)

**Geographical location** – where the plant was harvested from

**Plant harvest** – Wild is best. It has natural fighting instincts

**Stage of development** – if the plant was at its highest peak when harvested

**Distilled organ** – not usually worried about in North America

**Mode of extraction** – You always want steam distilled

**Biochemical specificty** - Designation of biochemical specificity is critical in knowing what unique characteristics are available for therapeutic uses and specific purposes. For example, and benefiting from the wisdom of the ages. [site explaining gas chromatography and steam distillation](http://www.frre.utn.edu.ar/quimobi/clean/files/get/item/1870)
 

This may seem tricky to begin with

**Modes of use**
*topical* – most common
for Massage, regular bath. If you are using oils in a path, place your salts/oils/oats ect in cheesecloth to hold everything together. 

    Always dilute with skin sensitivities.

    Don't use petroleum based oils

    Essential oils don't mix well with water, apricot, sweet almond ect.

    Always mix your oils in glass

**Aerosols** – affect the limbic system
**Always use a GLASS diffuser**

    Oil goes through the glass and adamises through the air.

    Heating oils – heat kills the biochems therefore leaving no therapeutic effect

    using pads – all the biochemicals evaporate

    Plastic – oils eat through plastic. Not a good idea

As I mentioned earlier

**Cooking** – helps increase flavour

    Try these – 1 drop of basil on a bowl of chili

    mix 1 drop of ginger in with sugar for sprinkling on gingersnaps
    
    peppermint EO in icing for cakes
    
    Peppermint or sweet orange in a cup of hot chocolate. 

**Gardening**  

You can line a garden bed (or plant pots) with a string soaked in a diluted citrus essential oil. 
I don't have much experience with this area, thyme is one of them! 


    A nice carpet cleaner/pwder I use before vaccuming – 1 cup of baking soda, (base) eucalyptus. Sprinkle it all around and let it sit for up to an hour, its safe to walk on I sometimes move it around with my feet. Then vacuum it up! Sometimes I sprinkle EO into my vacuum bag too for a nice scent. 

    Floor washing – 1/2c vinegar, eucalyptus


*Fragrance notes are based on volatility and viscosity.* This is what gives you Top Mid and Base notes. Lighter oils are top notes meaning they will disappear quicker you add moire of this

Top notes: evaporate quickest

Mid notes: Balancer

Base notes: Smell last, sedative/fixative in the blend.

    A good ratio to use Top4 Mid3 Base1
    More ratios If you're wanting something from an acute problem use 10 drops
*Chronic: 7 drops total 2 mid 1 base*
*Synergistic: 8 drops 1 top 1 mid*

**Here is a Blending guide:**

For **normal dilution - which is 2.5%**

x amount of carrier oil - divide by 2 = drops of essential oil
for example: 20ml carrier oil / 2 = 10 drops.

Example of a 2.5% blend - 5 sandalwood

**Low dilution 1% for sensitive skin and pregnancy** (always check with a certified aromatherapist or someone of alternative medicine before using when pregnant

X amount carrier oil in ml - divide by 4 = essential oil drops

**Extremely low dilution, babies**
1 drop : 10 ml Or use sweet almond oil by itself.

**Some nice blends:**

Clary sage + ylangylang – calming

Lemon grass – 10 drops in a hotel(or house) tub to help 
cleans air

Grapefruit – brings joy helps with releasing grief

Thyme – gets rid of ticks

Lemon – cleansing. Good to diffuse in the air when cleaning

Basil + lavender – helps with insomnia

geranium – increases ambiance

Clarysage – helps with painful periods

Thyme

nettle herb and rosemary – gives hair a nice effect

wintergreen

patchouli – great for skin in general

vitivere + grapefruit – I just really like this one lol

citronella


considerations when blending: [Carrier oil info and shelf lives](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/carrieroils.html)

**oil chemistry:** volatility

Desired therapeutic action – blending correctly allows synergistic affect in the blend (action of oils increase by mixing together)

sequence of blend – changing the sequence of blending can chance the bichem properties and smell

Base oils: It's nice to use a mixture of different base oils here's some general information about some different oils

    *All purpose oils – used for cosmetics

Apricot kernel – high mineral and vitamins

Sunflower – Fine. Good for massage blends

Sweet almond – Soothing

Grapeseed – Good for oily skin.

    *Special carrier oils: help increase skin penetration

Carrot oil – lots of vitamins

Sesame – 85% unsaturated 15% saturated fat. Used as additive to enrich other oils.

Avocado – lots of vit A, protiens, fats, gives soft skin, absorbs easy.

Jojoba – long shelf life

Wheatgerm – rich and viscous. Strong smell. Use 10-20% ratio to other oils to prevent rancidity.


**Chemistry** [site reference](http://www.experience-essential-oils.com/chemistry-of-essential-oil.html)

This may be a bit in depth. But its useful information if you wanna get more serious about your oils!

Therapeutic oil has no propylene glycol or petrochemicals

main groups of compounds in EO's are hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds which are further divided...

*monoterpenes:* – inhibit accumulation of toxins, balancing.

*High in monoterpenes: Grapefruit

*Phenolics* – stimulate the nervous system and immune system. Clean receptor sites for cells so faulty information can be deleted from the cell. Antioxidants, anti-bacterial, antiseptic

*High in phenolic – wintergreen

*Alcohols* – increase resistance to oxidation. Ability to revert cells to their normal function

*high in alcohols: rosewood

*Esters* – reaction of alcohol and acid. Most relaxing

*High in esters: bergamot

* Aldehydes* – Delightful fragrances. Antiviral, helps decrease blood pressure, relieves stress.

*High in aldehydes: cinnamon bark

*Ketones* – Not as prevalent as monoterpenes and alcohol. Distinctive fragrance. Calming

*High in ketones: western red cedar

*Oxides* – derived from compounds such as alcohol

*High in oxides – Ravensara

    other compounds 20% or less: Alkalines, acids, lactines, coumarins, furanoids.

Most of these sub-groups can be broke down into specific compounds from there you can really see a total chemical profile of an EO.

    ie. grapefruit profile
    90-95% monoterpenes, &gt;3% furanocoumarines, sesquiterpenones, alochols, thiols. Aka detoxifeir, antiseptic, antiviral due to increased monoterpenes.

Over the last two months I've had some issues with my skin (and hair) becoming oilier.  I think something else could be going on that's making things wonky, which has been a blessing, but now I'm entering unknown territory and am completely lost as to what would help.  *I'm happy to post pictures if that would help, too.*


**My Skin TL;DR:**

*  I would still describe my skin as relatively balanced

*  I get lots of whiteheads/deeper junk around my chin (never red acne though)

*  Lately I've been getting one small red zit after another


I'm very good about leaving angry zits them alone or cleansing them safely and appropriately


I have read [this wonderful post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1cj3/everything_you_wanted_to_know_about_ocm_the_oil/) about the OCM, but clearing up my skin is number one.  After reading through the descriptions of every one of the oil options, I have narrowed it down to these:

*  **Baobab Oil**: absorbs quickly, very rich and stable

*  **Black Raspberry Seed**: light, antioxidant

*  **Brazil Nut Oil**: conditioning

*  **Candela Infused Oil**: regenerative, promotes circulation

*  **Camellia Oil (Olferia)**: excellent skin and hair conditioning properties, helps to diminish fine lines, nice and light weight, emollient

*  **Hazelnut Oil**: slightly astringent, tightens skin, maintains firmness and elasticity of skin, helps to strengthen capillaries, encourages cell regeneration, stimulates circulation

*  **Jojoba Oil Gold**: dissolves sebum and limits oil production in oily skin, not greasy and sinks right into skin

*  **Meadowfoam Oil**: one of the best oils to prevent moisture loss, adds shine and nourishment to hair, very stable

*  **Passion Fruit/Marajuca Oil**: antibacterial

*  **Tamanu Oil**: emollient, analgesic, softening


Should I consider something like Flax Seed Oil or Chardonnay Grapeseed Oil for the somewhat oilier skin I've been dealing with?  Or the pH-restoring effects of Pomegranate Oil?  Anyone had experiences with some of the more uncommon ones here?  Good experiences with something else I didn't mention??  *I'm just really struggling.

I decided randomly to try using coconut oil on my face since a lot of people have boasted about and I was unwilling to try due to problems with breakouts caused by trying new things. What I liked about it, oils is that it's easier to smooth on since it melts onto your skin - meaning I could mix it in a bowl first. The second thing is that it actually sinks into my skin rapidly, unlike my beloved argan oil which would leave me looking oily when I tried mixing makeup into it. My skin looks much better using coconut oil with my mineral makeup as opposed to using it by itself, and I get extra coverage - and less mess!

Unsweetened soy milk is my esthetician's idea. She suggested that I should add soy milk instead of water in oatmeal mask because it helps in hydrating the skin, I'm already in love with it. I use this mask once a week.

My friend insists that her hair ""adapts to shampoos"" so she has to switch her shampoo types and use different ones constantly because if she doesn't then her hair gets too used to one and her scalp gets oily. I suggest shampoo less often and she already skips 2 days in between shampooing.

She swears that her stylist knows what she's talking about (even though I disagree since her stylist said henna causes hair loss...) and so my friend has 3 - 4 types of very expensive shampoos and she cycles through them randomly in order to keep her hair from ""adapting.""

I looked this up and I can't find ANYTHING about hair adapting to shampoo in the sense that shampoo stops working after a while.

Has anyone else here heard of that or know what may be the real cause for my friend's overly oily scalp?

If anyone is curious, just to warn you in case this happens to your lip balm and you've never worked with shea butter before, some of my research into this project told me that shea butter can get grainy if its heated up and cooled wrong, and that can happen with this lip balm too (have had this happen a few times, and probably would have gone ""wtf?"" if I hadn't read about it before), the solution is to heat it up again and hopefully this time it won't turn out grainy. If it's already in the tube you can just hold it in your hand for a while or leave it in your car for a little bit on a warm day. Though it honestly doesn't have a real negative effect except for the fact that the texture isn't as nice, it melts and that texture disappears pretty quickly when you start putting it on your lips anyway.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalBeauty/comments/1buavn/favorite_things_to_do_with_shea_butter_i_also/

My hair is long, super fine, and super straight. I have virgin hair to just below my shoulders, and about 8 inches of dye damage below that. My hair has a tendency to look greasy at the roots, even the day after washing. Using shampoo every 2-3 days, I never had problems with my hair, despite the fact that I dyed it constantly. It used to float around me

I've been basically free of shampoo for well over a year, but after that - no matter how much I adjusted the formula - it was a downward spiral into oily, waxy hair that clumped all the way up to the roots.  

I tried water only - oily and waxy. I tried conditioner only (with my grease prone hair, so I tried mixing my own clay without it - dry and frizzy and coarse, if I didn't get it completely rinsed, and when I did rinse it well... oily.

I tried liquid castile soap. I tried shampoo bars - some storebought, to ensure that any problems I had weren't simply transitional.

The best I could hope for was the-day-after-washing hair, and that I had just been brainwashed by cosmetics manufacturers to desire artificially squeaky clean locks. I tried to just live with it. I wore my hair up every day and I was miserable.  

So

Here's what works.  

Finally, and I decided I could live with it. One day a friend gave me some henna. I added the henna to my shikakai.

**It was like magic.** At last, which is actually a good thing - but it is clean and smooth and I am happy with it.

I have sensitive skin and a dry, I brush my hair then mix about 2 tablespoons of powder into a cup of hot water. The powder just consists of equal amounts of henna and shikakai. In the shower, *before turning the water on*, I slowly saturate my dry hair with the mixture. A little at a time, starting with my scalp, I splash some on my hair and rub it in. 

By the time my hair is soaked down to the tips, then wring as much water out as I can. I clip my hair on top of my head, do all my other shower stuff, then unclip it. I splash a few tablespoons of my herb-infused vinegar into the now-empty cup, fill it with water, then soak my hair with it. I let it sit for a few minutes while I splash the rest of the vinegar mix over my face and body, then rinse. 

I don't know if this would be needed with virgin hair, sometimes I'll rub in a tiny bit of aloe or argan oil after the shower, but only to the ends of my hair.

And that's that. I brush it, just because I think my process still has room for some improvement, but right now I'm just enjoying my shiny clean hair.

**Packaging**: Love it. [It's simple, so you know JMO isn't messing around with letting sunlight break down their products. It also has an airless pump, so no worry about contamination there. The bottle isn't huge, but 3 pumps give enough product to get my face and neck, which is good. 

**Pros**: Well, and I have yet to see any change in my skin color or get a sunburn (crucial since I've noticed *sun damage*--ack!!!--on my forehead/temples, which is actually sort of terrifying to me). 

I also have chronically dehydrated, I got a few tiny pimples on my forehead at first (a place I *never* normally get pimples, evereverever), but I can't be sure it was from this product since I had just tried a few days earlier a different sunscreen that I didn't like. Now, I'm not breaking out, my skin actually looks pretty great (haven't had a single breakout since that first forehead one). 

It smells nice, citrus or sunscreen or otherwise, goes away within an hour, though.

It doesn't leave any creepy

**Cons**: This is a heavy sunscreen. It probably won't be for you if you have oily skin. I'm hoping that once it goes from ""hey! Springtime! My and your and everyone we know's favorite season!"" to ""infernal NYC summer, but balanced on my T-zone, so sometimes it can feel a liiiiiittle greasy on my forehead, but it's not awful for me. 

It's also more expensive than something you'd just grab at the drugstore. I picked mine up at Whole Foods

**Ingredients**: 

Ran the product through [Skin Deep](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/product/435263/John_Masters_Organics_Natural_Mineral_Sunscreen%2C_SPF_30/) and [CosDNA](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_c41c97475.html), etc.)

*Active ingredients: Titanium Dioxide 7.5%

*Inactive Ingredients: Aqua (water), ethyl hexyl palmitate, glyceryl stearate, glycerin, cetyl alcohol, jojoba oil, shea butter, tocopherol acetate, magnesium aluminum silicate, benzyl alcohol*

I've only recently gotten into the habit of taking care of my skin, but like I said, I only started paying attention to my skin recently so i couldn't make an accurate comparison to how it is during warmer seasons.

I keep a humidifier running in my house, and oatmeal with milk. For a regular moisturizer, normally I apply either coconut oil or a mixture I put together of aloe gel, vegetable glycerin and several different oils including jojoba and avocado, but it seems like no matter how often I apply them to my face my skin still feels dry and rough almost immediately after as if the oils won't soak in or something.

Does anyone have any idea why my face has been so stubborn against all my attempts at smoothing it out and moisturizing it? Is there anything else I can try? Something I've also noticed is that my face will become VERY smooth and soft after I've rested it against a pillow for even a few minutes. Of course

That's just how soap is made. Companies might try to hide it by listing ingredients as ""saponified oils of..."" or similar, etc. often contain SLSs instead of lye. You can make shampoo bars with lye that are beneficial for hair too, as long as you know what you're doing. I have curly hair for example, which is notoriously hard to wash with bar (lye-based) shampoo, and my hair has never looked or behaved better now that I've figured out a recipe. I barely need styling products anymore. My hair always looks like the beautiful ""day 2"" hair I used to try to reproduce, and I don't use conditionner, which for someone with curly, sounded crazy even a few months ago.

So yes, hand made, gentle, milled, triple-milled, cold process, hot process

I was inspired to write this up after a comment I saw today. I think it's important information to know that as long as soap is made properly

For many years I have had 1 and then 2 unwanted facial hairs that were isolated to those two hair follicles.

I have normal skin but am acne prone

- Should I add castor oil? I've read the debate on this

- Parts of my face gets a little red (mostly the problem areas) after OCM? It goes away very shortly but is this normal? This is the same when using shea butter (at least the problem spots). Is this irritation or just from general application of products? Am I applying too much pressure? @_@

- The shea butter doesn't seem to absorb into my skin and instead it kinda just sits on my face like shiny layer :( Should I switch to jojoba instead like I do after OCM? I wanted the SPF benefit from the shea. I've always read that everyone should moisturize

- Can I or should I still use the aztec clay mask? I'm scared that it will clash with OCM unlike honey which just feels calming but not like purging.

I am either detoxing all the crap bp suppressed through out the years or my hormones are out of control and I'm just another adult acne sufferer (I don't know if I can blame it on genes because my brother has perfect skin and eats like crap and my parents have good skin and said they never broke out when they were younger). 

I've switched back to commercial cleansers and bp recently but it just isn't the same now. It just makes my skin red and scaly, I'd rather have healthy looking skin with acne than exacerbated skin with acne.

1370237400.0,1fkcll,Deodorant Roundup - LaVanilla Deodorant - Ooh La La!,Vikaroo,10,2,7,"I'm sorry for yet another deodorant post

So, but here's a short list with my thoughts. I will comment on smell, texture, application, and sweat-proofing.

Crystal - Works okay for sweat

Soapwalla - $14/2 oz. Smells fantastic, which I don't love since I have to wash my hands afterwards or risk breaking out if I touch my face. Contains Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda), which causes my pits to break out into a rash - although less of one than any other baking soda containing natural deodorant I've tried. It worked okay for smell, but only lasted half the day. I woke up smelling poorly and I don't even want to talk about how bad I smelled after my 5 mile daily runs (vomitus maximus). Not to mention that most of it ended up in the pits of my shirts, thankfully it seems to wash right out when I do a load of laundry, but it will make you look like you've been sweating if you wear lighter shirts. This is my Second Favorite deodorant (my first favorite until I discovered LaVanilla). People LOVE this stuff, so if you don't have a baking soda irritation then go for it

[Crunchy Chicken's recipe](http://angrychicken.typepad.com/angry_chicken/2008/07/homemade-deodor.html) - This was actually the first one that I ever tried, otherwise it requires fingers to apply. I like that you can make it smell however you want, but it doesn't work for very long. It doesn't work when I'm working out, it makes little deodorant balls in my pits, and I started to smell again just a few hours into my day. I would stink in the morning, and if I didn't take some with me to work then I'd have to scramble to find something to cover up the smell. 

[Probiotic Deodorant Recipe](http://frugallysustainable.com/2011/11/homemade-probiotic-deodorant-that/) - This is where I went after Crunchy Chicken, or the smell. I love that I could DIY and make it smell awesome, and I used this one for the longest overall because I couldn't find a solid replacement. Unfortunately the beeswax made this more difficult to wash out of clothing than the others I tried, but I stuck with it since the pit rash wasn't terrible. It stood up to just over half of my 12-hour work shifts, but I still stunk after work, in the morning, and it still didn't stand up to my runs. The beeswax allowed me to put this into a deodorant tube

Just Coconut Oil: Some people are lucky enough to be able to just throw some coconut oil on under their armpits and use it for deodorant. If I were one of those people I'm sure that I would be singing the praises, and other than making my skin a little softer I ended up with painful bumps, so I can't recommend it but others have had better luck.  


Which brings me to... 

LaVanilla (Blackberry Vanilla): $14 for 2oz, but if you smell it in the tube you'll be a little misled because it smells better on than it does in the tube (I'm guessing because the heat brings out the scent). Reviews indicate that there may be a problem with the plain Vanilla scent becoming sour after a while, which has not been the case with the Blackberry for me. It's nicely solid, which means you wont accidentally overuse it as can be the case with creamy finger-application deodorants. My favorite things about this deodorant is IT DOESN'T GIVE ME A RASH!! Yes, that deserved all caps. It's due to the lack of Baking Soda (Sodium Bicarbonate), and some people don't have a sensitivity to it in the first place. Some reviews also reported that some people broke out in a red rash under their arms that was not painful, itchy, but of course YMMV. Also, obviously I shower between running and working).

Edit: Per No More Dirty Looks there is some question to whether LaVanilla contains a petro chemically derived ingredient

1368539748.0,1ebb18,Fighting acne - an ongoing journal,doppelmoppel,8,0,13,"**UPDATE Day 53**

Thank you guys for the ongoing suggestions!

Azelaic acid has made a HUGE difference so far. I have basically had no spots for a week, the comedones that I usually have under my skin seem to have reduced in number. Basically, I could go every day and find some little nugget of sebum to squeeze out of my skin, but recently I haven't found so many. This might mean that the keratolytic element of the AA is doing its job, so sebum is no longer trapped into my skin. I don't expect all comedones to dissapear in one month, this process can take several months to a year, and I'm applying the AA at a low dosage

 The important test is what happens in the next 2 weeks


**UPDATE Day 35**


Upon suggestions I gave up on Aleppo soap (sad, with the very mild calming ingredients I use (aloe, clay, jojoba, several essential oils) I see an improvement because one type of acne is inflammatory. And yet it's not enough. Another big type of acne is comedogenic (which I have) which is caused by either overproduction of sebum (not in my case, my skin is relatively dry), or faulty skin structure which traps sebum and creates comedones, because their skin is basking in testosterone) or increased sensitivity to the hormones. As it is, crap

So assuming the remaining cause of my skin problems in caused by excess keratin, glycolic acid and azelaic acid. 

I opted for **azelaic acid** because: it's a natural plant extract (you probably eat it every day without realising :D ), and anti-bacterial effect and most of all, it anti-hyperpigmentation and pro-healing.

I decided to use it sparingly (once every 2 days). I used it twice now, because I'm in my calm period of the month, but when I touch my skin I don't feel so many comedones as before. I have pictures taken on day 30, so I'll update in another 30 days after comparing the hard evidence only.

New regime:
* Aloe+TTO as toner
* Jojoba oil based cream as moisturiser (contains lots of nice antibacterial essential oils)
* Mineral make-up
Evening:

* Wash - honey+clay
* Aloe + TTO
* Same moisturiser
* Topical: zinc oxide TTO salve
* Once every 2 days: azelaic acid on affected areas


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



**Day 29**
I will be updating this as it happens. Feel free to critique

Acne and skin type: Mild to moderate. Inflammatory+comedonal acne, and now, for the first time in my life, I am getting it on my forehead, which I've always had it completely clear. I dunno WTF. FYI I do not have bangs, or any hair change.

Regime: 
Morning:

* Aloe+TTO as toner
* Jojoba oil based cream as moisturiser (contains lots of nice antibacterial essential oils)
* Mineral make-up
Evening:

* Wash - Aleppo soap (traditional soap used for acne)
* Aloe + TTO
* Same moisturiser
* Topical: zinc oxide TTO salve

* Occasional - Rhassoul clay masks

Results: 

* (+) inflammation is waaay down with aloe. Aloe is the SHIT. A big problem for my skin was any sort of scratch/itch would generate a spot on the...spot. With aloe
* (+) zinc oxide + TTO is awesome at healing down
* (-) my skin is still full of clogged pores. While the aloe helps with the pores not getting so inflammed
* (-) I don't have so many active spots
* (-) I still had my usual hormonal flare up. Not surprising as external stuff won't affect the internal stuff.

I've lurked this subreddit for about 3 months now, shampoo (baking soda), conditioner (ACV &amp; Aloe Vera), face moisturiser (coconut oil), face exfoliant (baking soda), bronzer (cocoa and cornstarch) and I am really interested in going even more natural by making my own perfume, eyeliner, etc.

My question to you is this: when you made the switch, feel free to remove this post. I have LOTS of product left. Lotions galore, toothpaste bottles, shampoos, conditioners, makeup...Stuff that really now, I see almost no use for.

If I just throw it all out, I will have lots of empty (pretty) bottles that I could reuse. Have you guys ever re-purposed the bottles?

I could also give them away

Another option would be to just keep it unused. Although I wouldn't mind keeping small quantities when others come over

Lastly, could take years to finish, meaning it would take years until I benefit from going natural.

I saw about using henna as a hair dye on here (Thank you

The questions for those of you who are familiar with the products and with process:

1. Since we are most likely getting the hibiscus tea, and let it set, even with the Brown coloring? Or what is the best way to add the leaves in taking the type of henna we have into consideration? 

2. Since she does have black hair with the salt and pepper grey

3. On the manufacturer's packaging it mentions that the henna should set for a minimum of 2-3. Is it okay, the better.

Another oil which I highly recommend is Argan oil, it's a very good hand moisturizer. With one drop you have enough. I also use it to moisturize my elbows. As I said before it's quite pricy but a little goes a long way. 



So for my beauty routine I use argan oil for my face, also sometimes I use olive oil for my hair but olive oil is best for salad and for eating it (don't fry with it because it has a low temperature tolerance). Omega 3 (also for health), and avocado oil for cooking as well, it's also good for the hair but what makes it stand out is its high tolerance to high temperatures which is good for frying, but please avoid frying food.



Top recommended

Coconut oil- best for consuming and hair

Argan oil- best for skin

Olive oil- best for consuming




Other Oils

Grapeseed oil- best for cooking.

Tea tree oil- best for skin.

Avocado oil- best for frying and cooking

Sesame oil- best for cooking





VERY IMPORTANT: Tips for buying oils.
You got to be extra careful there are many fraudulent companies that claimed to have organic or extra virgin oils when they're not


You got to be EXTREMELY careful with omega 3 and olive oil, for omega 3 I recommend Triple Strength Omega-3 Fish Oil 1360 mg of Vitamin World, and if you have money this omega-3 is better http://www.dr-ricoperez.com/servlet/the-296/EPA--dsh--Fish-Oil/Detail

I've been desperate for years to clear up my acne/acne scarring (I'll be turning 20 years old in just a couple of weeks, it worked! By the fall, I would go months without a single blemish.

Early this year, and as such began to incorporate more products into my routine. The long and short of it is, I began to break out again... not as badly as I had last year, but certainly more than just a few months ago, and I am growing discouraged. On top of that, my skin has grown much more rough/irritated than usual. I hadn't believed it to be the new products (I would always patch test, and nothing broke me out immediately), lifestyle

Here is my routine now (natural products all raw and organic). Products marked with a * have been added in the last five months

Morning:
1. Wash with honey
2. 50/50 ACV and water as toner
3. Aloe vera as moisturizer
4. Argan oil *
5. Sunscreen (not natural) * (I've used sunscreen for years


Afternoon: 
1. Wash with honey * (to remove sunscreen/grime from being outside)
2. Tamanu oil *


Night:
1. OCM (1/3 olive oil
2. Honey mask
3. Retin-A gel (not natural)
4. Tamanu oil * + olive oil


As needed:
1. Tea tree oil *
2. Greek yogurt/turmeric mask * 
3. Calcium Bentonite clay mask * 
4. Baking soda exfoliator (2x/week)


Medications:
1. Cyclafem 1/35 (birth control)
2. I also recently got off a dermatologist-prescribed antibiotic after being on it (and one in general) for years.
