My brother was bashed by some assholes outside McDonalds Wynyard Saturday night

http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/man-fighting-for-life-after-cbd-attack-20130602-2njel.html

Based on what I've been told by his friends, asked him what he thought he was looking at and then punched him in the face. He didn't get involved in the fight, he didn't provoke them, his only crime was being in the same general direction as where they were headed.

I want these guys in front of a magistrate

Does anyone know anyone who was there? Does anyone have photos, but clear, front-on shots and **names** are going to be more useful.

And if anyone has some form of actual solution here I'd be interested to hear that as well.

**Edit 1:** Police are looking through CCTV footage now; as a few people have said, outside of my brother's assault, because they apparently fought their way up George Street like a significantly less entertaining version of Final Fight. Obviously if anyone saw the fight police at The Rocks would be very interested to hear what you saw.

He's stable; it's too early to say if he's going to make a full recovery but from what I gather it's unlikely he's in danger of dying.

**Edit 2:** Apparently early news has been saying my parents are going to switch off life support? This is bullshit

**Edit 3:** A witness has come forward and the police have got decent footage of the guys buying McDonald's. Will link it here when they release it. Will ask about whether they paid with cards. Channel 7 has some witness footage

**Edit 4:** We've held a press conference: Simon's stable, has talked about the assault (the attackers were white Australians, thank you racist guys in the comments). We've asked for lockout regulation similar to what's been effective in Newcastle, and for more long-term assistance for children in danger so they don't grow up to be thugs. It sounds like the Tele has their own ideas - I put the Cabcharge idea to them at least. Police sound confident, according to media sources.

Thanks for all your kind words and ideas so far. Hopefully we'll be able to spur real solutions.

**Edit 5:** Simon is breathing on his own. He's in no state to talk but he's starting to regain consciousness.

Police have released CCTV footage. It's a clear close-up shot. I'll try and get a copy; 7 provided us with some earlier footage but Mitch didn't recognise anyone.",self,t5_2qkob,1370254578.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/1fiakm/my_brothers_been_bashed_and_i_want_a_slice_of/

* Take the ferry back into town

-------------------------------

**Daytrip 4: Blue Mountains/Katoomba**

Approx: http://goo.gl/maps/J24Ey

This takes a bit more organisation

- You will need water/food/Jacket/raincoat/beanie/gloves on this trip (i prefer gardening gloves for the long stairs). 
- Visit the [NPWS website](http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/FireClosure.aspx) for closures.
- [Track Notes + Guide](http://www.wildwalks.com/bushwalking-and-hiking-in-nsw/blue-mountains-katoomba/federal-pass-track.html) - [PDF Version](http://www.wildwalks.com/maps/pdf/nsw-bmnp-fpxx.pdf)
- Take the [train from wherever you live](http://www.131500.com.au/) to Katoomba Railway Station (2hrs!)
- Take a taxi/bus/walk/hitchhike to the Lookout at the end of Echo Point Road.
- Go to the visitors centre and get a map/check local restrictions (safety/fire etc)
- Follow the track to the 3 sisters. 
- Take the giant staircase track (the hardest bit) down to Dardenells Pass
- Continue until you get to the railway track
- Then head home

PROTIP: Get the [Explorer Link Ticket](http://www.cityrail.info/tickets/which/explorerlink) which includes return (same day) CityRail travel to Katoomba Station with all day access to the [Explorer bus](http://www.explorerbus.com.au/map-and-timetable.aspx).

Other things in the Area: 

- [Cable Car](http://www.scenicworld.com.au/ticket-options-passes-2/)
- Local businesses/shops etc
- Other walking tracks

NOTE: Once you're down the steel steps, pack clothes to keep you warm and dry. Nobody wants to be ""that guy"" where the rescue helicopters and search&amp;rescue volunteers come to find you because of your own stupid mistakes.

What i need to know is what is what it'd take to be able to support myself, i'm only every home to sleep, leave home at 7am and come back at 9pm, repeat every uni day. Otherwise i'm working one of two minimum wage jobs, not complaining as i don't have very much experience. 

I've applied for a good amount of jobs far away and will continue doing so until I land one, are there any other locations that might be good for me? (Currently at south west syd, rough areas aren't very new to me)

It's hard to raise your face when people like that absolutely destroy what you've been working on for so long. It's like they completely dismiss what Islam says. We've seen how our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was abused during his lifetime

1350630563.0,11qjtd,Sydney Free Events Guide Update,cantfeelmylegs,82,11,12,"Hello wonderful Sydneysiders

I am sad to say that compiling the free events guide might not be a possibility for some time to come. I always enjoyed compiling it and you all have been very appreciative. I am leaving all the websites and resources I used to find the free events below.

----------------

1. **SMH's Metro Critics' choice**. Comes out every Friday. Just search up ""Smh Critics Choice"" on google and click the first link. Or go to http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment and search ""critics choice"". Look for the free subheading. This weeks critics' choice: http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/critics-choice-20120920-267jx.html

2. [**City of Sydney's What's on**](http://whatson.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/search?search%5Bcost%5D=free). Click on the Free events tab and browse away. Make sure you get through the later pages to see more.

3. [**Family Fun in Sydney**](http://familyfunsydney.blogspot.com.au/). The person who runs this blog is amazing. Great compiled events of family oriented events in and around Sydney. Just look for the free ones. Also has a nice Google Calendar/twitter.

4. [**ABC's The Big Diary**](http://www2b.abc.net.au/EventCentral/View/Search.aspx?p=0&amp;ci=0&amp;pm=2&amp;m_ctrlSearchExtended_m_hdnJavaScriptEnabled=true&amp;DateSelector=range&amp;LocationSelector=region&amp;PostcodeSuburbID=0&amp;RegionID=31&amp;FirstDisplay=False&amp;c=-1&amp;SearchDateRange=0&amp;esd=&amp;eed=&amp;StateID=2&amp;RegionDropDown8=-1&amp;RegionDropDown7=-1&amp;RegionDropDown6=-1&amp;RegionDropDown5=-1&amp;RegionDropDown4=-1&amp;RegionDropDown3=-1&amp;RegionDropDown2=31&amp;RegionDropDown1=-1&amp;PostcodeSuburb=&amp;cat=-1&amp;subCat1001=-1&amp;subCat1002=-1&amp;subCat1003=-1&amp;subCat1004=-1&amp;subCat1005=-1&amp;subCat1006=-1&amp;subCat1007=-1&amp;subCat1008=-1&amp;subCat1009=-1&amp;subCat1010=-1&amp;subCat1011=-1&amp;subCat1012=-1&amp;subCat1013=-1&amp;subCat1014=-1&amp;subCat1099=-1&amp;subCat1202=-1&amp;Keywords=&amp;Audience=-1&amp;ofe=true&amp;FindEventButton2=Show+Events). Many local listings of events. The link provided has the free and Sydney filter applied.

5. [**Timeout Free events listing**](http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/events?name=&amp;keyword=&amp;letter=&amp;category=&amp;date=&amp;special=free&amp;section=&amp;tag=&amp;order=). There are some good free events listed on here.

6. Check [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/directory?loc=Sydney%2C+New+South+Wales%2C+Australia&amp;is_miles=False&amp;slat=-33.87&amp;slng=151.21&amp;radius=100&amp;lat=-33.87&amp;lng=151.21&amp;price=1) periodically to see if there are any ticketed free events in Sydney

7. [Sydney Talks](http://www.sydneytalks.com.au/) is a great place to see all upcoming talks around Sydney. Usually it shows which ones are free and I just include them. Thanks to a redditor who introduced me to this website. 

8. For more lectures and talks and other events around Sydney I have found going to major universities events page to be quite useful. [Sydney Uni Events](http://whatson.sydney.edu.au/events/) and [UNSW events](https://www.unsw.edu.au/events). For both

9. Check major council event pages for some local events e.g. Burwood Council

10. A nice visual way to see some free events is over at [Weekend Notes](http://www.weekendnotes.com/sydney/free-events/). Has some out of Sydney stuff as well.

11. Check out the free events listings @ [Sydney Olympic Park](http://www.sydneyolympicpark.com.au/whats_on/free_activities_events). They usually have many free events.

12. [Everguide](http://everguide.com.au/arts-and-culture/news/sydneys-top-five-freebies-october-19--21.aspx) put out a weekly free events guide. This one is pretty artsy and music oriented. Still cool of course.

13. Museums around Sydney have some pretty good free events. [MCA](http://www.mca.com.au/whatson/all/?price=free) and [Art Gallery of NSW](http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/calendar/type/free/) come to mind. 

14. My favourite FM radio stations [Eastside FM 89.7](http://eastsidefm.org/blogs/eastside-events/) and [2SER 107.3](http://www.2ser.com/news-and-events) regularly talk about their events

15. On top of the websites I used to get a lot from Sydney Morning Herald's Metro section every Friday

If I think of any others I'll surely add them on this post. 

------------------

Things I have learned from compiling free events around Sydney:

* Sydney always has something to offer either in the city or in the surrounds.
* Sydney is flipping beautiful. 
* There are many landmarks, institutions and events that can continually provide you with inspiration, entertainment and experiences all for free!
* This is a very
* As a Sydneysider I am pretty lucky to have this many resources and infrastructures (although not perfect all the time) to facilitate all good interactions with the city and it's people. Got to make the most of it all! 

Lastly

That's all from me. Take it easy.

These guys must be trained to pick their targets - look for females by themselves

Anyway she is calling the company tomorrow to complain and see if they will pay for a detailing to buff the scratches out. I'm sure they will try and brush it off but we will see.

* Options for customising the number of questions and timer settings

* Tried to keep interface as simple as possible e.g. Swipe to continue and landscape mode

* Detailed results page allowing you to visualise

* Includes all graphics and images

* Available 100% offline

It's available on the Play Store [Here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hsc.mchoice) for free for the next 3 days. ~~After that I am planning to sell it for $0.99.~~ **I have decided this app will be up for free

When: Saturday June 15

*****

**Overview**

This is a compulsory event for all /r/sydney members. Anyone who doesn't come will have their default subreddits changed (and locked) to only Brony subs. If you're a brony

There are BBQ's on site

******

**What To Bring**

MAKE SURE YOU BRING FOOD... and not just packets of chips. **We expect each person to bring a proper food contribution + a bottle of softdrink/juice/etc.** Feel free to use the comments area to say what you're bringing so others can balance it out. This is only for the sake of fairness

**We are bringing sausages and bread rolls for all

Some suggestions

* MEAT
* Pastizzis/pastries from a local bakery/patisserie.
* Sandwhiches/rolls (mixture of meat/salad or just salad stuff... or peanutbutter/bacon).
* Pullaparts/etc from the bakery.
* Cake.
* Cupcakes.
* Cake. ;)
* Crackers 'n dips.

******

**Getting there**

Bus map: http://imgur.com/Yw6IU

The 433 goes right past the park and from memory there's a bus stop around the word ""the"" in ""The Crescent"" on that map.

The 431 goes more often, where we will be.

There's also light rail

For those getting Taxi or driving, go STRAIGHT through into the little driveway, that's the car park.

Item he was getting people to buy
http://imgur.com/ak5mBho



So essential I was off to lunch in chatswood and this guy who was dressed as a monk comes up to me and forces a small good luck charm into my hand then pulls out a notepad and gets me to sign it. 

After I sign he removes his hand from the notepad and was actually covering a part which asked for a donation amount. I ended up giving him $4.00 to get him to leave me alone. 

But honestly he didn't look impressed

Needless to say the whole thing left me feeling a bit scammed and wanted to know if anyone else experienced a similar situation?

So one day, what he'd done didn't count as assault, as she wasn't injured. They couldn't do anything except make a note of the incident. Let's say they were *dismissive*,  I think that's fair. 

Luckily, they told us the next time we saw him, call them on their direct line and they'd send someone. And they did. A couple of days later I saw him walking down the street, called the station, and a car was there in five minutes. They detained the guy, got his details, went round to his house and talked to his family, at least in our street. 

But here's the twist in the tale. **The first lot of cops never told us about the second lot.** They pulled up in their cars

I'm not sure what this means about the NSW police,,False,self,t5_2qkob,False,,True

When I arrived in Sydney, Central Station was great, the atmosphere is something I adored from the first minute.

I met so many people in Sydney, the cultural activities it has to offer, the amazing small spots you don't find on tourist maps. 

Just wandering throught the CBD without anybody to bother me, Coogee, or even Camperdown and just walk through the suburbs. I loved every single bit of Sydney.

Sydneysiders, and visit [this exact spot again](http://goo.gl/maps/De64l) and [take the same photo](http://i.imgur.com/vycWr.jpg), or just visit the Quadrangle of the University of Sydney. But most of all I want to meet the people which made my stay in Sydney so amazing.

** Getting there **

Bus map: http://imgur.com/Yw6IU

The 433 goes right past the park and from memory there's a bus stop around the word ""the"" in ""The Crescent"" on that map.

The 431 goes more often, where we will be.

There's also light rail

For those getting Taxi or driving, go STRAIGHT through into the little driveway, that's the car park.

When I first moved out of home, potentially creating a good resource for the sidebar.

When I started writing my bit to start off the conversation, I got to the point where I wanted to recruit other experienced Sydney redditor renters to start adding their sections.

[I've made an editable google doc](https://docs1.google.com/document/d/1PVsXKUTJyxtq8p0yHfCu1cPEDqqkp6VB1uTW7OZrVVA/edit?authkey=CKiXl8MN&amp;hl=en&amp;pli=1#) but I also have a personal copy which I'll add bits to as I see them written in case we get a troll in there.

When it's done

I'll probably keep adding stuff when I get motivation, don't be shy about making any changes yourself.

Only two rules:

1. Don't delete anything someone else has written (I'll keep an eye out for obvious trolls)

2. Write a blurb about yourself and your renting experience in 'About the Authors', or use your reddit username, put some kind of identifier in.

I just knocked off work and went to Railway Square and arrived to a drunk/gassed up bloke screaming while being pinned down by five bus marshals.

He wanders off and comes back

A car understandably toots his horn at him, wearing security uniforms.

Obviously dealing with shit cunts is annoying enough at work, who jump back in the car and leave. The guy, who was already bloody before this mind you is uninjured and flags down a cab.

Another witness from the other side of the road warns the driver

The last I saw of him was when he went running after the bus, from Railway Square, well past where the Clare once stood.

I couldn't help but laugh at times because of how often his actions backfired

1318563004.0,lbn80,Your City's Zombie Defence Rating,zombie-defense-meter,51,8,62,"Sydney's Zombie Defence Rating is:

Average.

Sydney is an unusual city to review. There are a lot of positives

It's hard to find a renewable energy percentage for Sydney, I'm afraid that the vast majority of Sydney will lose all power.

I'm afraid that civilian population is not well armed, but it does offer insight as to what kinds of guns are held by the general populace.

Furthermore, I've been witness to someone having a .22 ricochet off their head. That's hardly promising in the event of a zombie apocalypse, where that's the principal target. Shotguns are decent, but again, most shotguns are equipped with tiny bb's. This is more than adequate to make someone's day that much worse, but zombies do not flinch, they do not feel pain. That weapon will essentially be a heavy noisemaker. Thankfully, and could be modified to include heavier loadouts.


Simple diffusion will help Sydney immensely. The idea of a ""defence line"" seems rather silly, then hopefully the city can hold together.

IF other cities should fall, with patrols ready to sweep up roamers that wander into the city after taking a wrong turn.

The vast amount of hunting ground (as you border so much national forest) and fisheries that Sydney can operate would see to it that the population wouldn't starve outright

This would leave a LOT of Sydney's population free to patrol the interior of the city. They could respond quickly if a dispatch system were created; say a hospital were to start being overrun, a response could be immediately dispatched on foot, as on my visit I found Sydney a *remarkably* walkable city.

**If all should go tits up**

If the pooch is royally screwed

Boat your way up and down the coast. Try to find places that are welcoming survivors

If you are forced to flee

#1: Fishing rod/gear. That's practically infinite food. They're not exactly rare. You don't have to buy one now

#2: Non-exhausting fire starting material. You can buy this stuff online. It's very useful

#3: A sailboat/sailing ship. A boat is less visible

Hey r/Sydney.
I'm back for my second run at the Sydney Comedy Festival. I sold out last time and people seemed to like it so hopefully all of that could happen again.
It's a small room and on in a couple of weeks so if you're interested it's probably better to book sooner rather than later.

That said

Here's a show description - 

This show follows an epiphany junky's search for one more cerebral hit.

](http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/wikipedia-blackout-a-slippery-slope-volunteer-editors-20120118-1q66v.html)

So rather than enlightening the SMH technology readers about the issues of SOPA/PIPA which can affect even Australians.  They are spinning Wikipedia as the bad guys here not taking a neutral point of view.

At least Wikipedia's blackout post discusses their position on why as a neutral organization they are forced to take this stand.

I don't see SMH come clean with a disclaimer about how as a media/content organization they benefit from people NOT talking about SOPA/PIPA at all!

I bet if Wikipedia didn't get involved, it's buried under the carpet.

Shame on you SMH!

First issue: it didn't work in my wallet - complained about multiple cards. I guess that means either my paywave or work card is clashing. Work's scanner worked fine though.

On the weekend I was so keen to use it for the $2.50 sunday thing I forgot it wasn't everywhere and got up to Hornsby and then realised - the guy let me out anyhow. Think they need at least one swipe card per station to do the weekend stuff.. But I realise it's a trial.. Still.. One card reader at all stations would be far more useful than all readers at just city circle.. When no one is really able to use it for most trips. 

The pricing is complex - they've stuck with the shitty mess they have currently - which people will whinge anyhow - might as well have gone for an overhaul and be done with it.

I say thanks, then says he wants to chat. I just tell him sorry, I am running late I need to go etc, and then as we get separated in the crowd he grabs my elbow tightly to pull me towards him. At this point I freaked out because a) I don't know who the fuck he is and b) don't grab me, so I said sorry I have to go, bye and quickly ran off into the rain.

Can anyone please explain if he was just a freak or if he was trying to sell me something? The whole situation had got me confused and I would appreciate it if I could go about my day without getting harassed by strangers on the street.

A few weeks ago we had our wheelie bin replaced by our local council. First time out it disappears and an older one with no lid is there in it's place.

We notice the place next door has a new bin and has been vacant for about a month. We took it assuming the garbos made a mistake.

New tenants move in 3 days ago and our bin is now back in the house next door. And I have [this letter from the new tenants](http://imgur.com/hl7Xy).

He comes over and abuses the people downstairs (we're in a duplex) for bin theft and rants and raves about it being a federal offense and not to mess with him.

Am I crazy or is this bloke a nut job?

I mean seriously? He has no history with the neighbourhood and I'm pretty certain there isn't a Federal Police Task Force for wheelie bins.

Anyways. I've called the council to check the serial numbers... and thoughts from other redditors are really welcome.

Cheers

Hey guys

We seem to get many posts about people looking for a house/accommodation, renting, buying, and hotels. etc.

Was thinking of things like

- Websites to find flat mates
- links to legal advice 
- city rail, etc
- perhaps some crime statistics + house price stats?

So if anyone has some websites

I'll start it below.

I'm Snitch and my best mate of 20 years and I do a podcast called the **Snitch and Lins Podcast.**

The show is a sort of mixbag of audio comedy. Sketches, crochet. We'll give it a go if we reckon it'll get a laugh or make a warm jumper. 

We're both Sydney based Redditors and we'd love it if you'd check it out. I am a radio producer by day so rest assure it's good quality audio and not recorded on headsets over Skype (not that there's anything wrong with that).

You can check it out on iTunes [here](http://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/snitch-and-lins-podcast/id259854977) and the most recent episode on Soundcloud [here.](http://soundcloud.com/snitchknows/the-snitch-and-lins-podcast)

Feel free to direct your feelings of betrayal and disgust to our [Facebook page.

Have a listen and we'll both owe you a coke.

Right from the start I should have known something was up. The reception staff were very unprofessional and inattentive, she took one look at my face and decided she had made up her mind on my diagnosis. There were no questions about my history or symptoms (aside from the medication I was taking for my acne) and no real discussion of what the problem was - I literally had to interrupt this woman everytime I wanted to speak or give some perspective. Then she tells me she ""wasn't too interested"" in my redness and wanted to focus on my acne - as I said, my acne doesn't bother me too much and wasn't the reason behind me agreeing to pay the $210 consult fee. When I said that, she brushed me off.

Then she decides [Roacutane](http://www.roacutane.org/) is what she needs to prescribe me. I've read about this stuff before - for those who haven't, *on top of that*, she tells me I will need to come back in 6 weeks and pay another consult fee to get a prescription. I actually thought she was kidding. When I asked her point-blank whether there was anything I could do to reduce my skin's redness, she said no. Just no.

I left $210 lighter with my face (ironically) red from anger. I paid $210 for what felt like a Roacutane seminar. On top of that

From what I can tell, but her name is next to the clinic's name on the building's lobby directory - level 11.

I'm not a history buff. But some historical perspective is nice to have. Otherwise, but if you're lonely, by yourself, have some time, have little money, then try a walking tour. Or maybe go on a bicycle for speed. With smartphones etc, some websites or PDFs can be read on the go. This is probably not for the tourist with time pressure; more for the new locals who feels stuck and lonely in an expensive city. 

Sydney Council has printed some self-guided walking tours. You can download

The Glebe Society—generally my favourite suburb—has created some walks.

I won't deny it, instead of being pathetic and feeling sorry for myself the rest of the day, can anyone suggest anything I can do to make today, and possibly the next few days a little less depressing?

-------------------

**UPDATE** 

The current weather forecast for tomorrow makes the Devil's Hole track a little too risky for a group. So I'll be updating to a new location (Wentworth Falls). No need to worry about the train difference, plan for rain, bring food.

This is the final decision.

-------------------

RSVP and additional details are on the Facebook event page: http://www.facebook.com/events/248710688588223/

-------------------

**WALK:**

http://www.wildwalks.com/bushwalking-and-hiking-in-nsw/blue-mountains-wentworth-falls/wentworth-falls-loop.html

Very group-friendly walk. This is a great walk, with Empress Falls arguably the most stunning. The walk then heads up to Conservation Hut, a great spot for lunch before continuing along the Over- and Undercliff Tracks back to the train station. An excellent walk.

It's 6 hours total but there's several cutoffs if we want to make it a shorter circuit. We can also cut 2 hours off the walk by returning to Leura station instead of Wentworth at the end. Also

-------------------

**THINGS YOU NEED TO BRING:**

- Enough food and water for yourself and one other to last a full day.
- Camera!
- Backpack.
- Insect repellent.

-------------------

**ATTIRE:**

- Wear pants/shorts you don't mind getting dirty.
- Closed in shoes. 
- Warm jacket.

-------------------

**WHEN AND WHERE:**

- December 1st

-------------------

**ADDITIONAL INFO:**

- I'll be bringing first Aid/other necessities. 
- If we decide on the more difficult walk
- Stick together at all times. 
- No dying.

I currently have 3 cats. I've recently decided that Olive, needs to be re-homed. She is a cat that needs to be the only cat in the household, as well as being an indoor &amp; outdoor cat. This means my flat with 2 other indoor only cats is not the right environment for her. Plus, 3 cats is just too many (I found Olive out the back of my block of flats about a year ago)

She's a lovely cat, and loves meeting new people. She's almost 1 year old (Birthday in October, roughly)

She's been desexed and microchipped

All train-carriage numbers are 4 numbers. E.g. 4847. Use those 4 numbers to get to the number 10 using any standard arithmetic. You must use all digits. You can rearrange the order. So in this case above 4847: 8/4=2 *7=14 -4 = 10.

Early today morning at about 2am near the entrance to the M5 tunnel

The taxi was completely totalled. The commodore was allegedly badly damaged too, let alone breathing. The police arrived later and took statements from everyone, and said they informed other stations and highway patrol, but there was nothing they could do.

I understand lots of business face financial ruin, and so that's pretty much his livelihood down the drain. On top of that we rent our home, and my family is under major stress trying to figure out how we can keep going.

At this point the police have pretty much let us know there is nothing they can do. Does anyone have any advice

I don't want to live with 4 other lone wolves in a boring international student apartment. I'm a great source of entertainment when you need it, stories, jokes, insights, etc.). I'm keen on sports and adventure. Camping, spectating, the beach, I do it all. Gentleman by day

And I'm not all just fun and games. I'm a hell of a cook and I keep tidy. I do dishes, I love animals, and I always turn off the light. I'm so in tune with my feminine side and my masculine side that I'd date myself if I had to. I look good and give great advice - on your girl, your guy, your computer, anything. Humility aside (as if it already wasn't), I'd say I'm pretty intelligent. Got a question? Need to know how something works? I'm your man. 

I work hard, and sleep soundly. I've thrown off all expectations for the coming year and am as excited as I've ever been to explore the great wonder that is Australia. 

Hit me up if your friend group just lost one to the universe of girlfriendland (or boyfriendland). Or let me know if you and your significant other have an extra room you need rented out. Actually

Trust me - I'm a keeper.

1319510483.0,lnwza,Could we have an r/sydney ladies club?,lunchbawx,28,4,36,"Dearest ladies (and men who may have lonely ladies)

I need girl friends. Sure, and those are tricky to get to. I want someone to watch girly movies with, to go shopping with, to go out dancing with on Friday nights. I have a boyfriend and a small close group of friends (all of whom I met on the internet) but my boyfriend works nights and my friends all prefer a night in with their computer than a night out with flesh and blood people. That used to be fine with me but I'm 26 and now I feel like I haven't done anything fun or crazy and Friday nights alone make me feel achingly sad.

My problem is that I'm also terrified of other ladies. After growing up being severely bullied, the majority of ladies I've met (like my ex housemates) enjoy gossiping about stupid things like Jersey Shore and True Blood and don't understand when I use sarcasm or make a joke that maybe refers to Doctor Who or something internetty. (No harm to ladies who like Snooki or Sookie, but when they're the only things a person talks about of course it's going become tiring.)
 
It would be great to meet up with other ladies who perhaps feel similar. We could take it slow. Get a Facebook group. Go out for a drink and sit in terrified silence with our desperate cases of bitchface. I'd really like to try.

EDIT: Hooray! A response! I have started a Facebook group called r/sydney lady pals.

Try to keep submissions pertinent to the *City of Sydney* and not your local suburbs e.t.c. to keep it as relevant as possible to the widest audience.

* Major transport hubs are centered around Wynard (Train station

* If you need a nice bathroom/toilet to take care of business most hotel lobbies have nice bathrooms which anyone can access providing you can keep a straight face as you walk through. The Swisshotel on Market St. is one I've used on occasion without any problems and is quite centrally located.

* Hyde park is pretty much the Sydney equivalent of New York's Central Park and while large

* Major shopping districts are located around the Pitt St. mall area as well as inside the Queen Victoria Building and also the World Square

* Darling Harbour is a nice area but has always been a white elephant and is nowadays a shadow of its former self. Come here for some nice food with a view but thats about it.

* Barely anyone uses the monorail for effective transit due to outrageuos prices but its pretty fun.

* If your heading to the Northern Beaches via Public Transport the L90 Sydney Bus service goes all the way from the CBD up to palm beach and stops at most major bus stops from Warringah Mall outbound.

If someone could address the major nightlife venues around sydney city without bias that would be great





**Inputs from replies** (I'll finish up these later

From *Im-post-able*

&gt;Explore - Some of the coolest things in Sydney CBD are found by walking off the beaten path. There are plenty of food courts and eateries that are hidden away and are orders of magnitude better than the ""main"" food courts.

&gt;Driving - If you're driving to a location on the other side of the city

&gt;The Lord Nelson Pub - If you like beer and food.. go there.

&gt;Harts Pub - If you like beer and food more than people who go to the Lord Nelson.. go to Harts pub. Epic microbrews and gorgeous food (try the burgers)
