1348966989.0,10owjg,Must Read NHL 13 Tips,,79,18,24,"Alright guys.  I was complaining about struggling with scoring but I've already come a long way and I have started scoring a lot of goals.  I've always played Defense well

Here's some things you need to understand before getting frustrated.

**NHL 13 is the most realistic hockey game ever.**  I promise you that it understands hockey intelligence and player roles.

Here's what you need to take from that statement:  When you're a 75 overall fourth-liner

So pick corners and snipe one-timers with your top line, through traffic, someone will redirect that right into the net, or Garrison will pick a corner.  The game recognizes that you are playing to your line-ups strengths and it rewards you.  How do I know this?  When you build your AI for sims, you have the ability to create roles for your lines, adjust sliders for dumps, shooting frequency

The other area I have had trouble in is skating and protecting the puck.  Especially in EASHL where multiple defenders attack aggressively with the overpowering poke check.

Here's how I have gotten over it.  **I GLIDE!**   When you glide you have several options available to avoid defenders

The ""45 degree cut"" is a move you can execute if you slow your roll as you enter the zone.  Skate as fast as you can towards the blue line and then let go of the left stick.  When your defender tries to line you up and takes his first step towards you, so thats 1-2 o'clock and 4:30 (if you will), or 7:30 and 10:30.  Your skater will make a quick move that leaves you in control to make an accurate pass or shot.  The inside/down move (7:30 or 4:30) is a tighter turn and it creates a lot of distance between you and a defender giving you space (typically AI).  The inside/up move (1:30 or 10:30) is very subtle, but it really just puts you one step ahead of where your defender thought you would be.  So use this one to get past an attacking aggressive defender.  Every time I use these moves I feel like I'm better than every single person on the ice in EASHL.  They are effective and like I said, they leave you in control to make a good pass or shot afterwards.  I usually score, or set someone up for a nice play after I beat the defender.

Even when a defender does get his stick on you, and you usually end up with the puck.

When you are skating at full-stride like you did in NHL 12, you should just enter the zone and shoot a wrister at the pads and hope for a rebound.  The goalies in EASHL are capable of stopping almost anything a Pro 3 shoots at them.  Once you get some real attributes, go ahead and set your player to Sniper and start lighting the lamp with some razzle dazzle.  Until then, play like the piece of shit fourth liner you are.

When you're skating off the puck

EA HEAVILY PROMOTED THIS GLIDING TECHNIQUE.  I am surprised I don't see anyone utilizing it yet.  It's everything.

b:

This brings me to my next point:  
  
**Defense**  
I know how real hockey is played
1) The key to defense is for you and your teammates to all crowd together in front of the net. That way
2) An added bonus of the above is that the goalie never has to worry about seeing shots, and your goalie will have enough time to commit to a move. That way, when the rebound is laying there on the ice and the offense gets it, he won't get hit by the puck when they are scoring.  
  
**Goaltending**  
This position exists purly to scorn your teammates when they don't let you play forward. The key here is to get in fights and let in lots of goals. Oh and if someone on your team chooses goalie,False,,t5_2ry2z,False,,,t3_lgz4k

* Faster simulation for PS3.

* Teams should be able to trade to save cap.

* Trade players rights (like when Washington traded Wideman's rights to the Flames).

* Trade conditional draft picks.

* Change the potential system. It would be better if a player picked in like the 7th round becomes a franchise player. That NEVER happens in NHL 13. Look at Lundqvist and Rinne for example.

* Move the ""now simulating"" box so that it doesn't block the transaction news.

* Players drafted from European leagues shouldn't be forced to play in the AHL directly

* You should be able to see how your players not playing in the NHL or AHL is doing in their respective league.

* Put the Winter Classic in the the gm mode.

* Bonuses in contracts.

* There should be some sort of loyalty stat. Alfredsson is always traded in the first season

* Leadership stat. How much the captain affect the team.

* You should be able to see the goalies consistency stat in the GM mode.

* You should be able to go back and check who got goals/assist/PIMs and other stats from specific previous games.

* There should be like world juniors/world cup included. The scouting should be more effective during these tournaments.

* You should be able to postpone trades

* Injuries should be more realistic. Played as the sharks once and Thornton, Niemi, Boyle and Pavelski were all injured for months all at the same time. I mean it could possibly happen, but seriously??

* Players should be able to request trades

* There should be like morale/fatigue/form like in FIFA

* I'd be cool if there was like an imaginary twitter feed like in Madden. It would really make the GM experience in depth. For example if you're doing a GM mode as let's say Calgary

* Real in-depth scouting reports on specific drafted/undrafted prospects. Like: ""Sam Reinhert has the potential to become a superstar

* Faceoff and discipline stats should be able to increase/decrease. (See next point).

* Player training. You should be able to for the type of team you want. You should be able to train you players to be the type of player you want. You want a team that is a defensive juggernaut like the Bruins or an offensive tic-tac-toe type team like the Canucks? You should be able to focus on developing different aspects of players.

* Change players positions to fit your team better. If there is a player that you really like in the draft that is for example a center, but should go back to normal after a while.

* Short cut button to switch goalies. Like triangle or what not. Very annoying to go into edit lines to switch goalies.

* More variations in the ""new generated"" players that are created when you have played a few years. It is always the case that the first overall is the only decent player in the draft

* You should be able to interact with players more, so that you can actually prepare to trade away salary in the trade deadline/draft.

* Players shouldn't always resign. If they feel they want to go to a more successful team or what not.

* Include various clauses in contracts

* Player search. Instead of having to go through every team,False,,t5_2ry2z,1373304954.0,,,t3_15qd7g

* *If you form an EASHL Hockey Club for NHL 13 and want to have it listed on the sidebar, make a post. DON'TFORGETTOSLOWDOWNTHEREPLAYTIMEONYOURVIDEO.

* *FYI: The best way to get into an EASHL league is to join your console's OTP Night.* The organizers of such events will post details soon

* *A community has been recently created to focus solely on GM CONNECTED.* It's called /r/RGMC and you should probably check it out. There are two leagues created for PS3 within and others will probably follow shortly. I've also seen sporadic postings of other GM Connected League subreddits... so if you want them linked

* *If you have good sources of information for the community, feel free to place it in. If you don't want to handle the edit, again, let me know and I'll do it for you.

* *If you're new to /r/EA_NHL, what really makes this community the best of this franchise is that it is led by its kickass membership, . That, and we steal everybody else's shit. Let's keep it that way and have another kickass year.

Reposting the whole thing in one post would probably make everyone TL;DR hard

Without further ado...



**#1: Dangles McDangler**

*What He Does:*

* First off, suddenly start twirling around in the neutral zone for ten seconds trying to carry the puck in yourself, rather than pass it to either of the other forwards or flip/slap it in, which would have caused all three of us (and possibly a D man) to enter the zone at full speed, therefore giving us a massively awesome forecheck and good chance of picking that puck up.

*Why It's Bad:*

* But no, you completely destroy any momentum we had going on the breakout.  And, since you've already destroyed our momentum, I have no problem carefully going offside every time you try to carry the puck in when passing or dumping would obviously have been better.  Hopefully you will figure it out by the middle of the second period, but let's face it... you probably won't, and will continually rage about that stupid winger who seems to always go offside when you've finally managed to get close enough to the offensive blue line to go over it (even thought you're going to get crushed as soon as you do).  I'll take a faceoff just outside the offensive zone over you turning it over and sending the puck back the other way every time.

*How He Can Be Less Annoying:*

* Unless you have clear ice in front of you, so that we can pass it up to you again and have you stall us in the neutral zone again.  And again.  And again.

1335564905.0,svyz8,How to Build your EASHL Goalie,inferno31,28,1,14,"Figured I'd compile what I've learned playing pretty much strictly goalie for the last 3 months.

**Selecting a Build**

* **Stand up** The build which gifts you the highest and most useful attributes by default. I would highly recommend this build for everyone until you are at least Legend 1 + almost all boosts unlocked. The reason is that until you can get more points and boosts you can't make the butterfly/hybrid compete with what you'd have as a stand up. Personally I find myself switching between this and the butterfly, but not drastically. 

* **Butterfly** Once again I wouldn't suggest this until you have more points. The animations though are superior in my opinion to that of the stand up

* **Hybrid** Not a ton of experience in this one

**What attributes to spend points on**

* Angles: Normally very cheap to upgrade, and if you keep it low you'll see a ton of goals go in off you and into the net as you were facing the wrong way. Most successful goalies will keep this over 90. 

* Breakaway: An agility modifier that only works on breakaways. Used to keep it high

* Five Hole: Not many shooters go five hole

* Glove High: Aim to get this into the high 90s

* Glove Low: If you are playing a butterfly style get this real high into the 90s as well

* Stick High: Shooters often go for the corners

* Stick Low: The most useless of the 4

* Passing: determines how strong you clear the puck - useless don't change unless extra points.

* Poke Check: CPU only don't add anything

* Rebound Control: Either keep it 75 or below or 87 or higher. Depends entirely on your defense. If they'll clear front of the net for you

* Shot Recovery: I'm not really sure here. Some people say it doesn't matter at all

* Aggressiveness: Community is also split on how useful this is

* Agility: How quick you make saves

* Durability: Doesn't matter

* Endurance: Doesn't matter

* Speed: I used to keep this low as not to over slide. If you are just starting maybe it's worth keeping it on the lower end. I've been experimenting more with keeping it above 80 and like it quite a bit. This lets you get across the crease quickly for those amazing saves

* Vision: Second most important stat in this category

* Spend Boosts on the most expensive categories for points, Agility, Vision and then it's up to you a bit. 



**General Tips**

* Aim to have a goalie between 6'2 and 6'8

* Weight should be between 200 and 225 ideally

* Do NOT play goalie unless you have a good internet connection or you will have a bad time. 

* When you start you'll almost always over commit and bite on dekes, and learning to read the play

* Find and pick a view you like between Low, especially on scrambles. Low swings around and moves too much. All of these views except classic do suck in that the player who starts from behind the net is your worst enemy. You can't see the cross crease player in your vision, so you don't know if one is there and it makes it difficult to tell how far he's swung out in front of the net. You need to switch from the VHS to free butterfly to go from protecting short side to the middle and far side of the net as well. Shooters have a great advantage here, especially if they can nail you on short side the second you let go of VHS. Defense you really need to cover the posts and help your goalie out.

* Cross crease: how to play them depends. If it happens slow enough you can slide across standing or in your butterfly so your goalie makes the save if the puck is shot in that time. Otherwise VHS across

* Unless your D is top notch you can't play goal line camper. I've seen some top elite teams do it

* Anyone that's beside the net learn the angles on when to play the VHS and when to let go

* Experience is the best teacher

* Breakaways if you haven't done it once this game try the diving poke check, be careful about doing this too much if they are still too far out as they'll make you look silly (happens to me a lot still). 

* Defense strategies either do protect net/staggered or tight point or high pressure/tight point. Protect the net will stop the cross crease but they will do nothing on the rush for you, and don't go over to the computers side if they aren't doing anything to help as you'll confuse the AI and leave a man open. Change it up during the game based off how the other team is playing, you can make good use of AI defenders. 





I think that covers most of what I've learned over the last few months. **I'm leaving next week and will be back in August or NHL 13 not sure which yet. Want to say thanks to all the guys on the PSN side who've been awesome.** 

Also there is a ton of great goalies on the PSN side in sibs, rob, soups and others who are all pretty damn good at the position as well, I'd ask beginners to see how they play and learn from them. ",,False,,True,t3_svyz8

The metagame needs to change. Collectively we as players were spoiled for the past couple of years with stick lifts.  Stick lifts are not meant to be a viable defensive tool one on one with the offensive player facing you.


If you try to stick lift the player in this situation you will either take a penalty or the player will just pick up the puck and keep going.

This is realistic. How often do you seem defenders stick lift an offensive player on the rush in a real game in the NHL? Maybe once?  Try stick lifting a talented hockey player in real life while he is skating towards you.  He will laugh as he skates around you when he puts his stick back on the ice. How often did we see it in NHL 11 (for me I used it more than poke checks...)  Now tying up an opponents stick is something completely difference and not a feature that is in NHL 12 (yet).

This does not mean it is no longer a useful tool.  It has just become the same tool that it is in REAL LIFE HOCKEY.

Situations where the stick lift is useful.

The Pick Pocket.
This is when the player with the puck has HIS BACK TO YOU.  Normally done on the backcheck.  You may see Datsyuk use this move a lot.  It is more effective if the player is the opposite handiness as you (this reduces the chance of a penalty as it is directly stick on stick).  This allows you to come up behind lift his stick and take the puck with him being unaware of you.  An important note here is that you must be skating FASTER than the opponent or else he will just out skate you and carry on.


Interrupt the pass.
When a player is about to receive the pass you can lift his stick and he will be unable to receive it.  This works quite well with snipers who sit in the slot.  

Race for a loose puck.
You and a player of the other team are neck and neck racing for the puck against the boards.  By lifting his stick just before you reach the puck you will increase your chance to come away with the loose puck.

Double Team
You lift his stick. Team mate gets the puck. Useful for those damn puck hogs with 99 puck control!
(thanks to beerbaron7)

I'm sick of people taking penalties from stick lifts at inappropriate times. (I am very guilty of this) I think everyone has a bad habit from NHL 11/10 and instead of complaining about how stick lifts never work any more we need to get away of the bad habit of using them as a face to face defensive tool.

PLAYOFFS:
Playoffs are awesome in EASHL, everyone has a great time playing playoffs. 

But it sucks when you win. You win, what NHL team paints that they are cup champions on their ice the whole season? Just show the banner for about a week and let it never be shown again, or maybe just have it so the away team sees the standard intro no matter what and the home team can see their banner if they won. Also, instead of re-raising the same banner every month, how about adding a month to the bottom of it and seeing it raise to the top next to all the other months you've won?

Now the actual playing the playoffs can be kind of a let down too, PRESENTATION! Have virtual Rammer come out and present playoff MVP, hand out the EASHL Trophy, let the players pick up the trophy, skate around with it, press face buttons to interact with the trophy (Press B to raise and pump trophy, X to kiss trophy

********
**How momentum works**

We have not programmed momentum into the game

**Icing** - We have fatigue in our game

**Fatigue** - In general fatigue can be a factor. If you constantly take penalties

**Intimidation** - Getting hit, or when about to receive another hit. 

**Injury** - When a player is injured

**CPU strategy changes** - Nearing the end of the game

In short

********

**Can you get intimidated after the whistle?**

No

**How are grades calculated?**

For each position, your Skater overall grade is determined on an average of all of your grades for each position, weighing more heavily on the position that has more games played. 

The weighting itself is pretty simple. We look at your Center grade x Center GP / Skater GP + RW grade x RW GP / Skater GP + LW grade x LW GP / Skater GP + D grade x D GP / Skater GP 

This way we weigh more heavily on the position that you play most

*Rob_c's note: This is mostly bullshit. They weigh the most played position a bit more heavily

********

**Goalie Controls:** There is an option in the controller settings in the Main Menu screens to turn off auto stick sweeps and auto puck covers when being a human goalie

********

**How to improve Goalie Team play score:**

-Get a shutout period or shutout 

-Make rebound saves 

-Penalty shot saves or breakaway saves 

-""Big"" saves

-desperation saves (though attempting them is pretty risky)

********

**How to improve Hitting:**

Aggressiveness does not help you hit any better. You need checking, acceleration, endurance, and balance to be a great hitter. None of our tuners reduced hitting, we only removed hip check exploiting.

If you hit without speed you won't knock the players over. Also your opponents balence and strength and size matter. 

********

**How to improve Speed**

You need high accel and speed to be fast. If your accel isn't even close to your speed that is why your guy is slow.

For those of you that are new the sub-reddit and/or new to the game here are a few things you should know about OTP night:

1. To get to our lobby it goes as follows (From the NHL 13 main menu) Online&gt; Community&gt;Lobby&gt; Games modes&gt; REDDIT. Once you find the reddit room you will find out that it is password protected. To solve this problem enter the password which is ""bacon"". This will be the password from now until the end of time.

2. We DO NOT use the standard PlayStation 3 headsets. We use **Teamspeak 3**

3. We play for fun, on that note be respectful to other people. Some others will not be as good, due to being new, as a community we will do our best to help you become a better player. TL;DR - Don't be a chode.

4. The Games begin at 8:30 EST/5:30 PST. It's recommended to get on Teamspeak(Details above) and in the Reddit room before it starts to guarantee your spot in the first game(s). That being said

5. The way teams are picked during OTP night is by captains

&gt;We did a few small tweaks to the EASHL Pro regarding player types and how you can spend your XP. NHL is always tuned using NHL players and teams and we do not have separate gameplay for EASHL specifically. This year we have decided that you can no longer be better than an NHL player in any stats for EASHL, we have a hard cap at 95 for wrist shot accuracy. The cap depends on the player type and what they “Should” be good and bad at. A Playmaker for example, would be able to get up to a 95 passing, but not up to a 90 rating shooting. We feel that by adding a cap for each stat based on player type does remove some of the freedoms you once had, but also forces people to choose a player type that more or less suites their style of play. We want NHL 13 to feel different with the new skating system, and we do not want people to have unbalanced players by being able to have 99 speed and agility for example. 

&gt;You will also notice the player overall ratings will be much lower. This is somewhat of an unwanted result of the offline player rating separation that happened

&gt;Also note that these caps were set while using the Boost Slots applied so we ensured that even while using boosts you could not go over an unwanted level. This will result in some people thinking some of the caps are set too low

&gt;...this also applies to goalies. We looked at Miller and Lundqvist's stats to see what their rates were and determined that we won't allow goalies to go above a 92 in any given category.

1329785050.0,pykvt,EASHL Goalie Tips + Tricks,inferno31,25,3,19,"I've been playing goalie a lot lately and figured I'd compile a list of tips and tricks I've discovered to help people out. 

**For Goalies**

* Get used to pressing L2 for butterfly
* Don't be overactive
* Be aware of the L2 + R2 Combination to do the VHL technique against the post
* Whenever someone is behind the net be in a VHL or standup against the post
* On breakaways try not to move much or overreact
* ALWAYS follow the puck when its in your zone
* Make sure to follow the puck not just horizontally but vertically
* Always be aware of the pass
* In controller settings turn on auto cover
* Never leave the net to play the puck unless you are super comfortable with it and theres no pressure
* Fight when you need to. Simply put if their best skater challenges you to a fight
* Don't be an idiot. Concentrate
* Watch out pressing triangle! Its to cover the puck, press it just be careful on the long shots etc. 
* Really bored because your team of redditors is awesome? Press select and your camera will follow around the puck and you can watch the play from a normal view instead

**Designing your goalie**

* I prefer a standup style to stand just because of where the attributes go
* Spend points on Glove High and Blocker High
* Don't waste points on Poke Check (applies only to CPU), Durability, or Endurance.

**Tips for Teammates**

* If its CPU defenceman turn it to high pressure
* Try to intercept passes
* All defenseman want offensive points
* Play your position and try and not be a total dick to your goalie
* If you can stop the 2 on 0s
* I've always maintained a good human goalie is better than the cpu one just because they can keep you in plays and read the game a lot better

**Tips for Shooters**
I shouldn't be doing this section.. but.. 

* On breakaways if you back the goalie in you have a lot of the net to shoot at
* Get control of the puck behind the net! The moves it takes to deal with a good pass from behind the net to out front (Letting go of R2
* Even on breakaways if you notice the goalie is too far in the net
* Goalies will try to cheat on 2 on 1s and 2 on 0s
* Shoot.. seriously if you take shots that you can get through even from just inside the blue line you'll catch a lot of goalies who are sitting way too deep in their net for easy goals. 
* The game gives out easy goalie interference calls

Thats all I can think of.. Please add any tips/tricks you have on your own. I hope some of you guys found it helpful. Enjoy.

I honestly think the reason I've been losing is due to having the NHL back and actually watching hockey.  I think that I'm attempting to play my games too much like an NHL team would

Firstoff, funneling the puck around the zone, behind the net, and putting shots on net, getting deflections, rebound goals, etc.  In NHL 13, sniping the shortside corner

Secondly, or attempting to skate in a circular motion is going to slow down the player.  I think many players have puck control which is almost unreal, acceleration which is basically unreal, and turning motions which are impossible to make on a consistent basis like they are in the game.  Attempting to pin someone against the boards never works, and just the way that pinning someone against the boards is a one on one thing is flawed in so many ways.

As for goalies, it works quite often.  Also, I think that screening the goalie basically does nothing in Ranked games.

The game relies too much on flashy goals instead of strong team play and good strategy in transition offense and in the offensive zone; hardly ever is an ugly goal scored.

1342083015.0,wfmil,How NHL 13 Should Structure Its Matchmaking in EASHL,Whikadoodle,24,4,18,"Ok

EA has already confirmed changes to its matchmaking system
Drop-In"" to a game, enter a room. This room fills with players around your level, and when the entire room ready-s up (or the game timer reaches 0:00), you enter a player position selection screen, choose and then you're off to your game. 

What is the biggest problem with this system? As a user, the odds that each player in the game will be able to choose their preferred position are 1:1440 [6!*2]. 

Since this does not usually happen

So, start with  FIFO preference-based queue. Allow users to select the positions that they would be willing to play, then hit search. While this is searching, a player would be free to roam his club/edit pro menus/chat with friends in party until the search had completed. After this amount of time (depending on available online users), the player (and possibly his party) would be notified and matched up anonymously into an already full room filled with other users who used the same interface and had compatible preferences. Once the team readies (If not readied after *x* seconds, allow system to find a replacement ASAP), the team would be transferred to a quick screen (15 sec. max) where they would learn their team and player position (in accordance to the positions they marked earlier before entering the queue) and have the ability to choose team and jerseys, exchange phone numbers/sexual fantasies

So

1. The most obvious advantage is that it allows players to play their preferred position

2. This method would allow for large parties of players playing together to enter a game on the same team, Not Create"" room situation we have in NHL 12. 

3. This would give rise to the number of drop-in games played in a full 6v6 Sim-Hockey format. 

One of the only downsides I can come up with against this idea is the likelihood that, EA could counter this measure by adding a ""Random Character"" preference that, when checked, would place the character in whatever slot that is in need. While I would place some kind of minor-moderate bonus on a skater who is chosen this way (for the affected game only), we all know EA can be sticklers when it comes to freebies. 

I'd like to go into the aspects of time from ""I want to play"" to ""I'm playing"", at most, 3 minutes to enter an online game from ""Drop In"" to 6v6 face-off. This is assuming that no one quit during character selection, you didn't have to search for multiple games, etc. During peak times, this new system will undoubtably lower times from ""Want to Play"" to ""Play"".

1330907979.0,qhtxh,Been playing NHL since 09 and still learning new controls and moves.  Can we put together a full list of not so well-known controls?,CornerG,26,6,60,"Okay so actually I did (and still do) have NHL94 for my SNES so I been at this for a minute now but like I said I'm still learning new moves and controls to this day (especially from browsing /r/ea_nhl).

A couple controls I learned that others and n00bs might not know:

1.
L1 to cancel a pass if you're still holding it

2.
L1+Triangle to hack at someone.

3.
**Select** to change the view between following the puck/your player. Tested on Ice/Classic/Goalie view.  Haven't tested for Action(ew) or Broadcast(double ew).

4.
L2 vision control (can't imagine playing without it!) makes your player face the puck.  Can be used to wind up for a one-timer &amp; performing spin-o-rama.
 
Also

And if anyone has any other tips with controls let's hear 'em!",,t5_2ry2z,False,,psn,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/qhtxh/been_playing_nhl_since_09_and_still_learning_new/

1335749875.0,sz11d,NHL 13 suggestions ,95enjoipanda,28,11,74,"Even though some of you may not agree with me and it's not like EA would listen to suggestions wherever those would even be sent I think the NHL series still has more to be added to it so dicussion? I'll list some things I think should be added. (not in any order of importance)

1.) Playoff beards for the players that would/can grow them

2.) More to the pre-game like adding more showing of warming up or a national anthem or 2 although most of you would probably skip that I think it would be cool to hear Oh Canada and/or the star spangled banner before I got my game on

3.) GOALIE ATTIRE gah I get so annoyed when I wear the retro jerseys but the goalie will be sporting the same pads as normal

4.) Although this may not be allowed by 2k for whatever reason but Hot/Cold streaks and have them effect the ratings of players and more player roles like ""Team Leader"" ""Shoutout Artist"" ""Goon"" and stuff like that although they do have Snipers and Tough guys I still think there could be more.

5.) The commentators mixing it up I

6.) Draft picks and the lottery like how edmonton got the 1st pick but weren't the worst team idk how else to explain it but they use it in NBA 2k12 

7.) Players faces

8.) Faceoffs and players getting kicked out of the faceoff. 

9.) On-the fly line changing for those times you need the freshest and best players. 

10.) Blood during fights and brawls for when you're playing in a heated rivalry like the aves and the wings.

11.) Hockey night in canada previews of games and stuff like that. Don Cherry on NHL 13 oh god it would be beautiful or at least put Barry Melrose on there along with NHL.COM stuff afterall they did mention nhl.com a lot in the game. 

12.) Less Assistant coach involvement

13.) Add the US Juniors and teams like that to be playable like how the CHL is and the BE A PRO mode by being able to be in other leagues like Sweden's Elite league. 

14.) Add the KHL 

15.) These are a lot of points.

16.) More color in the stands like how the coyotes have their whiteouts. 

17.) Have there be the arena annoucer saying that row 123 won a pizza like how they did in NHL 99

18.) Close-ups on star players right before the faceoff. 

19.) Suspensions and Fines should also be added because they do play a part in real life. 

20.) More legends, Mccarthy, Yzerman, and Fedorov oh boy that would be so much fun to battle with the old aves ohhhhhhhhhhh just think about it man how awesome that would be. 

21.) That's all I can think of tell me if you agree/disagree/have things to add/know a way to get EA on to this stuff.",,t5_2ry2z,True,,xbl,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/sz11d/nhl_13_suggestions/

""Impossible"" I thought

Thankfully Daiyuki of the EA forums took the time to work me through the proper method of calculating grades

It works on the same principle as the old one, input games played and the spreadsheet will tell you the position you should be playing to get your grades up. It will also help you identify your weakest categories. 

If you want to give it a try, so it wouldn't hurt to have a few people try it out to make sure it's accurate.

Does anyone else notice how slow the GM Connected menu system is?  It is completely unbearable for me.  Every time I change a screen it takes about 30 seconds.  Even switching up and down between menu options is slow.  

I am a computer programmer by day and I can't believe this is how they coded it.  Why do they need to load irrelevant data on certain screens?  Also, it only needs to be updated if something has changed using a check bit or rsync method.  For example, it keeps telling me it is downloading match data.  Why don't you put that shit on another screen so you don't waste my time while I am just trying to mess with my rosters?  I feel like they could have stored a lot more of this information locally instead of wasting bandwidth and load times.

Like most of my friends I play both NHL and Fifa. We play a lot together but many of us have also had ultimate teams. Everyone has always loved the HUT system while FUT was ""worse but the best available option for football ultimate team"".

Now they've gone and copied the shitty FUT system to HUT 13. I can't even imagine who's idea it was and why.

Cons of the new system:  
- No career limit. Once you get a superstar player he'll be in your lineup until the release of NHL 14. Less changes in roster. Makes building a team more boring.  
- No salary cap. Promising rookies are worthless. No point in searching for not as well known players with good potential when you might as well fill your team with today's superstars. This makes trading more dull than before. Also you don't have to choose between focusing on offense or defense. Paying for cards is even more beneficial than before.     
- Contracts are useless. Before they were tied to the training and salary cap. Now they're just a tax for playing the game. Contracts don't benefit you in any way.  

Pros:  
- Injuries
- Reassigning player positions. Same as above.   
Can't think of anything else. If you have something to add please comment.

So I was playing the other day as goalie in a drop-in and we pulled a penalty. I skated to the box and the extra man came out and I realized:

What if the goalie controlled that skater for the period of time?

I would assume the only reason it hasn't been done is because it is too much of a hassle for the little time the goalie is off the ice

Tl;dr - If you play EASHL (drop-in, wouldn't it be cool to play as a skater when you're pulled either for a penalty or extra man?",,False,,t5_2ry2z,False,,

First I will say there is some area I think the AI should improve on, and most human players are pretty terrible and they will have to turn it down. BUT like I said we will see.

The thing that absolutely pisses me off to no end is that some people cannot grasp that there is a difference between a high probability scoring opportunity in real life and the game and a pure video game glitch goal. 

2 on 1s are a high probability scoring chance; you should score on a lot of them. It was addressed in the new game because now the goalie will sometimes cheat over, it’s a good scoring chance and people get so pissed off when it was there fault it was a 2 on 1 to begin with.

Another one that I always get annoyed with is the wrap around goals. They happen in real life all the time when the player just moves faster than the goalie

The only thing I ever really thought was a total glitch goal was the curve shot because it was really just a long range wrist shot that had no business going in 80% of the time when it should have been stopped 90% of the time. 

I think part of the problem comes when people are able to build their online characters to 99 when the NHL players are never that high

The more reason why I have this opinion is that when playing offline on superstar

OTP night was designed to be a way to kick back and play some casual hockey with redditors.  The main thing was that it be lighthearted and fun.  No arguing

However

Mistakes are OK in OTP night, ""Calm down, it's just a game"" comments, I'm not upset, yes it is just a game but I think most people want to play the game right and not have their game affected by someone else refusing to play as a team.  If you want to do your own thing and not be a team player, you need to be playing online versus, not OTP.  If you play OTP you need to consider your teammates

So, but when someone is frequently out of position, kindly request that they correct themselves.  I think we can all act like adults about this right?  Please don't call anyone out specifically in this thread, save it for during the game if needed***

OTP night for me has been the best thing about this game since it started back in NHL11 and I hope it stays that way.

This boils down to the fact that there are just far too many good prospects. There's absolutely no reason to even bother with players below three stars, everybody develops quickly. When you draft somebody with more potential as a replacement, you can generally trade your 3/3.5 star guys who are developing for decent draft picks, or bundled together for higher potential players......

Prospects at 4 stars or higher.....even 3.5 stars are far too common. There's also no real variance in how stars develop, that get picked in the later rounds, and come out of the abyss to become franchise stars. 

Also because of how useless anybody under three stars is, or a few third round picks into a first round pick.

Unless I'm missing something, or some sort of element where the players are dicks and request trades if you refuse to play them on higher lines, or just because they think the citizens in your city are pricks.

This is my first NHL game in years. I'm not sure if this GM mode is a lot different than past years....and I understand I'm a bit late to the party. But is this a common sentiment

How to Adjust Volume Levels using MP3Gain

This is useful if you like to adjust the volume level of your tracks. I put all the songs at 102-103DB. This is a setting that generally works well when the songs are transferred to the video game.


Here is a tool that I use to do this. The program is called MP3Gain It's free on their site and it's completely safe. This is what I use to increase the volume levels of multiple song clips. It's really easy to use and the reason I want you guys to use it is because it saves me time. This way you can just download my files at my custom DB levels (Usually 102-103DB) and then if you want to adjust you can just use this program.

In the game it this is how it generally sounds at these various sound levels.

99-100 Decibels = Soft (Generally low to very low levels of sound in game)

101-102 Decibels = Medium (Generally low to medium levels of sound in game)

103-104 Decibels = Loud (Generally medium to loud levels of sound in game)

105-106 Decibels = Very Loud (Generally loud to very loud levels of sound in game)

Part 1: Break-in-Play Tunes

What are break in play tunes?

These are basically the songs the NHL arenas play in between whistles. This normally occurs before a faceoff. I included a good variety of break in play tunes. 512 clips to be exact. Most of them are new songs that were not in my old NHL 11 pack.

Part 2: Intermission

What are intermission tunes?
Intermission tunes are song clips that are played in between periods. When playing an OTP/EASHL games the break can last up to 90 seconds at times so having these clips helps simulate the music played during NHL intermission. These are useful in all game modes though. There are 512 clips at 90 seconds each. I split this into 3 downloads since the whole thing is 1.35GB. Each file below is about 450MB each.

Part 3: Organ

What are organ tunes?
Organ tunes have many uses. You can make a playlist and combine them with the break in play tunes. You can just choose to only use organ tunes. You can apply team specific organ tunes to the teams who have it. It's really all up to you on how you want to customize your music experience in NHL 12.

CD: How to put the goal horn songs on your Xbox 360 using Itunes

*You will need a program called WinRar. To download this

*Some people say you can use a USB flashdrive to transfer music to your Xbox 360 but I do not know how (any help appreciated)

1. Download the files.
2. Once the folder is open in WinRar
3. Open up Itunes
4. Click File
5. Under File click Import
6. Import the playlist(The HMP one)
7. Create a new playlist in itunes(under file)
8. Put all the horns/songs into that playlist(right click add to playlis *enter name here*)
9. Burn it
10. Put the Disc into your Xbox
11. Rip it
12. Rename the songs properly
13. Once they are on your Xbox load up the NHL game
14. Go to the the menus and look for the custom music section
15. Apply the sounds to the appropriate areas

If you do not like the games default horn AND song
What I usually do is when the goal horn doesn't sound right in the game I use the GHS (goal horn song). This clip contains a custom horn and song together. I insert that in the horn slot and then disable the default song slot. The end result is that the custom goal horn song clip plays all the way through.

If you like default horns but want custom songs
You can also ONLY use the song. If you like the games default horn all you would have to do is just take the song clip and put it in the song slot.

To start off, not only does he not fall down (or react, for that matter) but he doesn't lose possession of the fucking puck. And that fucking happens more often that not.


I don't think I need to address the goalies, he absolutely shits on my goalie, no matter what. And on my end, I'm getting blanked. I honestly think I had the record for most shutouts-against in my GM League. 


Any poke-check an opponent throws in my general direction makes me flail from the puck like a fucking bitch. If I remotely glance at my R1 button


Are there some mechanics that I'm not getting? It feels like I can't keep possession of the god damn puck in any of my games. 


My rebounds are fuck-all. It can go through about three of my own guys and then get to some random ass winger on the opposing team who sets fire to his cock rocket and blasts one by my goaltender with some weak ass backhander from the point. The fuck is that shit?


Also, regardless of if I win or lose a faceoff my defenders skate into each other... And then the defender/winger on their team passes it to the center who skated past my defense and poops one into the net. 


I guess it is entirely possible that I'm just really really bad at this game


On top of my incredibly special defense, the opposing team seems to keep their puck. I've had so many situations where the motherfucker literally skates into/through half my fucking team and gotten some crazy bullshit scoring chances.


I know all of the basics, and it's starting to really get under my skin. (In case you didn't gather)

* Reddit EA_SHL Draft League: Given the success of the last time we did this

* We're thinking 4 teams of 4. Round Robin league play over 1 night

Start thinking XBL-ers!

**Mumble is optional but for the sake of organizing we'll be using it.**      

XBL uses Mumble to communicate during OTP night. The server is *eanhl.servebeer.com* . You can download the mumble client at these links:

For those of you that are new the sub-reddit and/or new to the game here are a few things you should know about OTP night:

1. To get to our lobby it goes as follows (From the NHL 13 main menu) Online&gt; Community&gt;Lobby&gt; Games modes&gt; REDDIT. Once you find the reddit room you will find out that it is password protected. To solve this problem enter the password which is ""bacon"". This will be the password from now until the end of time.

2. We DO NOT use the standard PlayStation 3 headsets. We use Teamspeak 3

3. We play for fun, on that note be respectful to other people. Some others will not be as good, due to being new, as a community we will do our best to help you become a better player. TL;DR - Don't be a chode.

4. The Games begin at 8:30 EST/5:30 PST. It's recommended to get on Teamspeak(Details above) and in the Reddit room before it starts to guarantee your spot in the first game(s). That being said

5. The way teams are picked during OTP night is by captains picks

I just want to make sure it is clear to everyone there are [5 ways to play games in GM Connected:](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf52GpMVh5I&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=82s)

1. Player vs Computer

2. Head-to-Head

3. Co-op Online Team Play 

4. Coach Your Team

5. Build Your Own AI

**Season length.**  
I hadn't even considered this yet but Mewen has suggested either having the season follow the entire year or breaking up the year in to 4 seasons with Playoffs and all.  
I like the idea of having 4 seasons over the year.  Everything is still up for discussion.  I can create another poll later on when I know what else needs to be asked. 

**Starting Rosters** 
&gt; EA chose against including fantasy draft because it didn't want the barrier of entry to be a tedious 45-round draft. If you want to mix up the teams so no one is forced to play with the Edmonton Oilers (zing!) you can randomize the rosters when starting the league. ([source](http://www.gameinformer.com/games/nhl_13/b/xbox360/archive/2012/06/01/everything-we-know-about-nhl-13-39-s-gm-connected-mode.aspx))

I am assuming we'll have to randomize the rosters

What I REALLY want to see is more creativity. The fans wearing custom jerseys. Using real Nhl uniforms/jereseys as templates (EX. A San Jose sharks uniform with the colors Maroon

For all leagues it would be cool to choose the fan base of teams playing (EX. Kings/home- 78%... Red Wings/away- 22%)(You can change the percents in the settings). Minumum Home percent- 65%

Of course like alot of people I would like to see more refs on the ice. So would I.

What I dont like about be a GM mode is that you can only be one team through 25 years and I would like to see that changed. But if that is something you guys (or EA Sports) likes

Also in Season mode, the home team) to be interviewed where they will be asked questions and the user can choose one of  three options to answer.

Before each game in every mode it should show the locker room and the players getting ready (like in some of the Madden NFL games).

EA Sports has been successful for making a lot of things in the arena live... except for the fans. It would be nice to see a small majority or fans get out of their seats and leave 1 minute before the game ends if one team has no chance of winning.

For each custom team you should be able to choose an Official Team colour for playoffs when the fans are waving their towels

If a player decides to not play as either team and just watch from the broadcast camera angle (which I do a lot)

Thank you for reading. I just want to see a more realistic game that will pull more consumers and hockey fans into playing this. You have nothing to lose by adding in more great features. You can only gain from it.

Sincerly

P.S- If anyone knows how to contact EA Sports with these ideas please tell me in the comments.

1) Reduced goof-off time (post whistle) in OTP/clubs to prevent the repeated abuse of the goalies. We weren't able to increase goalie interference penalties during goof-off time without increasing them overall. 

2) Increased the penalty for not selecting a side during a face-off. Some users were rapidly changing sides or not choosing a side and still winning a high frequency of face-offs. Now you will be more likely to lose the face-off if you aren't selecting a side and holding that side until the puck drops.

**Here's how it's going to go down.**


* 3 teams - Herpaderps

* **Round Robin** - Every team will play 6 games in the Round Robin (3 against each opposing team). Your team will get 3 points for a win, and a big fat 0 for a loss.

* After the Round Robin is complete

* **The Elimination Round** begins with the 2nd SEED and the 3rd SEED playing a best of 3 series to determine who goes to the finals.

* **The Finals** - The winner of the Elimination Round and the 1st SEED play a best of 3 series for the Final to determine which team wins the tournament and therefore has the largest testicles.



We are just finishing the development of a bad ass tournament spreadsheet which will track the progress of the tournament as well as track individual player stats.  Work is still in progress but here is the link if you want to check it out. 

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ap9E9FtikXsGdEZaZVVGb1g4dTEzQ2Ztb0w3NEttMGc&amp;output=html](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ap9E9FtikXsGdEZaZVVGb1g4dTEzQ2Ztb0w3NEttMGc&amp;output=html)


**A couple housekeeping items:**


* The tournament can start immediately.  Teams start by organizing your Round Robin games.

* All Round Robin games will be organized and scheduled by team captains. They do not have to be played in any particular order however all Round Robin games do have to be played within 2 weeks from the beginning of the tournament.

* A minimum of 3 human players (preferably more) must be present on each team to participate in a tournament match.

* All players must be on their team's roster at the beginning of the tournament to participate in any tournament games (no ringers for the finals

* It is the responsibility of each team captain to record game scores and stats at the end of every game. A score sheet will be provided to you before the tournament starts.


More details will be provided shortly.

&gt;SR: This is a great question…we’ve tried not allowing sticks to go through legs but the end result was a pretty frustrating gameplay experience where you would continuously keep losing the puck. Our conclusion was that until there was much more fidelity in the stickhandling/deking control

One of the posts in reply summed up how I feel pretty nicely:

""By 'Frustrating' you mean

You realize that any of us who want an experience that this game is trying to advertise WANT that level of ""frustration"" right? 

Its VASTLY more frustrating to watch a player exploit this lack of collision detection game after game after game than it would be to lose the puck because you put it somewhere stupid.

**#2: Guy Who Skates Directly Into Largest Concentration of Opposing Players**

*What He Does:*

No less annoying is Guy Who Skates Directly Into Largest Concentration of Opposing Players.  The breakout is actually looking good for once through the neutral zone, in the neutral zone, GWSDILCOP will try to get into the zone right at the boards, despite between one and three defending players all lining up a devastating hit, and get laid out by the defender EVERY SINGLE TIME.  This of course turns the puck over AND keeps GWSDILCOP out of the play for three or four seconds, which is plenty of time for the other team to set something up.

*Why It's Bad:*

If, he will immediately skate directly towards the net, where one thing will happen: He will try to toe drag around the defender, and get stick lifted or laid out, thus turning over the puck once again.  Ten repetitions of this dance will not get GWSDILCOP to EVER try to do anything else, like ring it around the boards or flip dump it in and chase it.  It's turnover after turnover after turnover, with the puck constantly coming back the other way.

*How He Can Be Less Annoying:*

When you're about to get smashed into the boards, my favorite, ring it around the boards.  The flip dump is RB+wrist shot, and the ring around the boards is RB+slap shot.  I'm convinced some of you didn't actually know those controls, but now you do.  Look--assume you're going to get destroyed trying to carry the puck into the zone, and instead of padding your turnover numbers, get the stupid puck in the zone and hope that one of us can snag it by the time you pick yourself up off the ice.

-Look for the reddit room in the Game Modes lobby (from the NHL12 main menu: Online &gt; Community &gt; Lobby &gt; Game Modes). As always

-Don't forget to complete the OTP night experience by joining us on Teamspeak 3

-There are also mobile TS3 clients available for Android or iPhone. I don't personally own either

-This is also a great way to join one of the Reddit teams or meet others who want to join/form teams! Make sure to post here if you are new and see what happens!

**Quick TeamSpeak Note: Last week it was really hard to get games started and organized due to A LOT of loud non-game related talking in the lobby. Not trying to be the TeamSpeak Nazi and say no one can talk because that isn't the case

The first is when you try to change your line after a pk/pp. If you change the forward/defense line then the entire line changes.Often if the other team is coming down on a slow rush i'll get a quick change in for my forwards and let me D take the 2-on-2 rush by themselves only to find that both of my defenseman are headed to the bench. This has been a problem since NHL 10.

The next is similar, or he simply won't change. This forces you to cover the puck or attempt to get a whistle in order to get your dying player off the ice because he's unable to change for the last 10 minutes.

Next is the time it takes to bring up the line change overlay to manually change your line. For whatever reason they made it extremely slow in NHL 11 and even slower now in NHL 12. It does look nicer but when I want to make a change

On the manul line change note, etc).The only cure i've found is to hit the line change button again and wait for it to go but usually by the time you realize that the overlay is stuck there the faceoff has already commenced, then you have to hit the line change button and wait 15 seconds for it to go away...so frustrating.

Still on the line change overlays and most appearant after a goal is the complete inhability to change your line. Most common with the defense lines after you push the button to bring up the overlay...nothing happens

And new to NHL 12 they decided it was a bad idea to take out the ability to adjust strategies during the introduction of the teams. Even just to tweak a teams forecheck to your liking you have to wait for the opening faceoff

These are all extremly frustrating glitches that really take away from the experience. Changing lines and adjusting strategies should be simple button presses and shouldn't be so tedious. It's almost like they're punishing people that prefer to select their own line or play from a different strategy than the default.

tl;dr line change overlays are broken since NHL 10",,t5_2ry2z,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/lar48/has_ea_fixed_any_real_line_change_bugs_from_nhl/

1317497257.0,kxp8h,Connection advantage and you (or why this game seems to sometimes hate you).,thedeathmachine,12,2,9,"Decided to post a bit of a clarification when it comes to the connection advantage one player will have when playing online. I've been gaming online since I was 8 years old (I'm 23 now) and have been somewhat of a gaming geek since then. One **truth** I've learned over these years is about the *host advantage*.

Basically, and the host's console is sending data packets back to you as well.

The transfer of data from one console to another is what creates ""lag"". All actions need to be sent to the host's console to be applied to the current game. This means that the host has no lag; all the actions he makes are immediately registered on his console. His actions receive an immediate and accurate response while others are dependent on the internet connection to send and receive data.

The game picks a user to host without showing who it picked; which is why many people are completely unaware of a host advantage. It most likely picks the user with the most suitable connection to host; however this I am not certain of. The biggest three factors influencing host advantage are the speed of both users' connections

The player with the host connection will always have the advantage; the size of that advantage depends on the three factors mentioned above. Sometimes a match-up can be pretty even given both players have great connections and live close to each other. Other times

Some symptoms of host advantage (assuming you're not the host):

- Your team cannot hold onto the puck; you lose the puck when simply skating near an opponent

- You cannot separate an opponent from the puck (poking, etc); anytime a puck is separated it goes right back to the opponent

- Your players feel sluggish and unresponsive

- The opponent skates through your defense without any trouble

- The game basically feels like it took a bribe from your opponent

The game that you see and play on your screen is a split-second behind what is actually going on. If you try and line up a check, sees and plays the game in real-time. The more the advantage for the host, the further behind the opponent.

On the flip-side

Here's a video showing what I'm talking about. I know

finished off the third season of a Winnipeg Jets franchise we've been playing on and off for the last few months. Hadn't won a cup yet, we blow up the roster (more or less). We go crazy young and get players with potential, some usable stats at the pro-level, etc. Pick up four prospects with the intention to turn them into our new core players: a center, a winger, a d-man and a goalie. We trade for Erik Karlsson/Gabriel Landeskog. Having signed Henrik Sedin in the off season, we have a decent roster, with the rest of the roster being niche players or fourth line garbage that never sees the ice anyway.

We go on to win the cup (finally)

The center was an 84 overall 20 year old with 4.5 star potential. Good

The winger was... a 79 overall 20 year old with 4 star potential, and he's a big power forward. After the off-season, he's still a 79 overall, but his shot is now mid-to-high 90's across the board.

The d-man... oh the d-man. OFD, poke check), 90's in passing and puck control, good stats elsewhere. High 80's skating. He's now a better Erik Karlsson.

And finally, he went from an 80 rated goalie with some less than stellar reflexive stats (his 80's rating was almost entirely from his high athletics) to a 95 rated goalie. And we still have him under contract for a year at 0.850 mil on a two way. 15 full overall points. Most of his stats went from high 70's and low 80's to the low-to-mid 90's. He's, unquestionably, the best goalie in the league.

In response to the NHL Lockout

1. The schedule will move ahead by 2 weeks every odd numbered day

2. All GMs have the option of playing their games outright (OTP or VS style) if both GMs agree to complete the matchup between sim days. The max # of user players is set at 3 to make it fair for those who don't have the ability to formulate a whole team and for those who will play against those teams VS style. We may or may not increase this number depending on the consensus of the league.

3. Negotiations are still being made regarding playoffs

4. Since we don't know how active/inactive a current roster sim league will make us, say, 6 seasons.

5. After completing the second season of this league

*IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN TAKING ON A TEAM IN THE Alt-HL

*I will need you to include your PSN ID if you don't have it in your flair.*

*The league has not been created yet. I will let you know when it's up and running...*

1348593348.0,10gj1f,NHL 13 and lacking National rosters,tenhotuisku,10,2,10,"The national rosters are in serious need of an update. I'm mainly going to talk about Team Finland because I'm most familiar with their roster but I'm sure the situation is no different for other teams. I know Finland is not a huge country but the team has won a medal 4 out of last 5 olympics and the World Championship in 2011 and it's ranked 2nd in the world by [IIHF](http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/championships/world-ranking/mens-world-ranking/2012-ranking.html) for it's steady performance so I'd consider it a pretty relevant team in international hockey. Not to mention a big market for the NHL game.

The team hasn't changed at all in years. There has been **one change** to the roster since NHL **09**. Jere Lehtinen retired in 2010 and was removed in a roster update of NHL 11.

Mikael Granlund is probably the most noticable player missing. He scored 9 points in WC 2011 including the [iconic goal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JazGHYDwp-s) against Russia in the semi-finals and was a huge factor in winning the championship. He also participated in WC 2012 and even most of the less important national team tournaments during the season. Yet he's still missing from the team

Do you think EA should pay better attention to their National team rosters? After all they're probably the most used teams after NHL.",,t5_2ry2z,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/EA_NHL/comments/10gj1f/nhl_13_and_lacking_national_rosters/

**It's OTP Night for XBox Live!**

What is OTP Night you ask?

Don't be intimidated, and noob friendly environment. We take all skill levels and this is a great way to learn the game.

No experience required but we do ask that you pre-make your characters ahead of time as we don't wait for you. Games start at 8:30 EST. (This may change in the future) If you don't make it to the room by that time

Regular OTP Info:
    The room will disappear when we make a game so you might not find it if you are late.  If you are early

    We typically do a party chat while waiting to start games. XBL has an 8 person limit for party chat which we often hit. If you can't get into the party don't fret

    We typically get 2-3 games in and usually run till about 10:30 EST at night. 

    You can find the room we play in by going to Xbox Live -&gt; Community -&gt; Lobby: Then cycling downwards till you see a room called 'Reddit'

Room name: *Reddit*

Password: **nhl**

~~HEY EVERYONE, I'm sure a room will be created.  Just check back every now and then to see if you can log in, I guess.~~
