Take the internet, for example: kids in high school are making some terrible decisions about their online identity and privacy, which could potentially be damaging in the future. How is a class informing them how to use the internet responsibly any different than a sex-ed class teaching them to use condoms?  They should learn about personal finance, predatory lending and the risks of credit card debt, their basic rights, maybe how to change a tire and CPR.

I was given the ""gifted"" label in kindergarten, math, and English skills for a couple hours a day while the rest of our class stayed with the curriculum.

The kids that were on that same ""smart kid"" ride with me, lazy, clinically depressed, and/or neurotic.

In 6th grade, 6B, the ""average"" kids, and 6C, the ""below average"" kids. This was a clear message to us, at 11, that we were either ""smart,"" or ""dumb."" This continued on through 8th grade.

I don't know if they thought we were are completely ambivalent to how we'd been categorized, we ended up with class segregation.

In 6A, and we all came from middle and upper class families in the same part of town. The kids in 6C were almost all from just one lower-class neighborhood, many were black or Hispanic, and most of them had been labeled by the school as having ""behavioral issues.""

Every single one of us ""smart kids"" ended up taking entirely AP, and that's why we were taking these classes.

If we performed poorly (for any reason), so they had pretty much no incentive to perform well.

We're all 23 and 24 now, most of us ""smart kids"" are living mostly ""average"" lives -- at some point, we all got burned out on being told how ""smart"" we were and not being able to handle the pressure of having the gift of being ""gifted.""

Our greatest fears had been letting our parents/teachers down

The segregation that I experienced, for the most part, weren't really ""dumb"" at all) were under the poverty line within a year after high school -- if anyone benefited from that stupid system, it was the ""average"" kids who were taught that work was actually worth something.

I've heard similar stories from friends who came from other school systems

**TL;DR**: School system segregated ""smart/average/dumb"" kids for over a decade; ""smart"" kids fell on their asses in the real world because we didn't understand that ""Smart"" was not going to be a qualifier on a résumés. Have you experienced something similar?

**Edit:** I know this is already a novel

Many people have mentioned [this research](http://nymag.com/print/?/news/features/27840/) into the ""smart"" label

YouJustLostTheGame also makes some excellent points and analysis [in this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse/comments/e4ejp/dae_feel_like_being_labeled_a_smart_kid_set_them/c158f4b).

General advice to redditors who experienced ""smart kid"" syndrome and have found themselves lost is pretty much the same -- to focus on work ethic, but personally, I think there are different bits of advice for people of different ages, [some of which I added in the comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse/comments/e4ejp/dae_feel_like_being_labeled_a_smart_kid_set_them/c15fb8a). **Please feel free to add your own advice**. A lot of redditors seem to relate to this issue, and the more perspective and experience we put together, the more helpful we can be to each other.

The younger you are, it's definitely a very real cautionary tale.

Since so many people expressed problems with addictions, remember that reddit is a huge community, and chances are there are hundreds (if not thousands) of people who have been in your shoes and can offer help.

  * You have a gif and want to see if it was on reddit

What works for many

Also, LSD or mushrooms to sort myself out. I've never done any of these drugs(or drank, for that matter). I'm NOT straight edge. I don't slap beers out of peoples hands at parties. I have many friends who drink and do drugs and I have absolutely zero problem with them. I'm gonna repeat that, because I recently had a friend flip her shit out on me because I made a joke (the both of us have a very acerbic sense of humor) at her rampant drug use and sexual forays. She took it very seriously, and one thing lead to another and she told me that I am pretentious(because I do not do drugs/drink), that I'll live a life of regrets (because I do not do drugs/drink) and that she wants me out of her life permanently. Oh well. She was a good friend.

Other people do drugs

And because of the wildly perverse nature of my dreams, sleep isn't the lovely, warm escape for me that it is for you.

In the US, then put on the road at age 16. Never again do we have to prove that we know the rules of the road, driving etiquette, maneuvering skills, or even very basic knowledge of the law. 

Would it be economically viable for the states to require another written and on-road exam every 10 years after your license is granted? 

**The key part is this:** the test would get more difficult every 10 years

My basis and reasoning behind this is pretty obvious: most drivers are *terrible*. Everyone, that is actually wrong. They practice this habit and rage when people don't yield to them, or do things differently. 

I think a better **mandatory** education and accreditation process could avoid a substantial amount of the road rage, and general chaos that takes place on our public roads. It could even be a viable way for states to fund the DOT programs, who knows.

There could be a fee to go along with this, but private companies could also compete. The driver would have a full year to complete both, which is a very ample amount of time. 

This would ideally weed out those that simply don't belong behind the wheel. Yes

Remember folks

Does this belong on /r/getoffmylawn/ or do you think this is a good idea? How could it be accomplished? I'm really interested in everyone's opinion. If there is support and I can craft a case

tl;dr: Drivers suck. Making mandatory education and testing every decade after issue of license might make everyone's lives easier in the end.

 Okay

Zero. Make sure that you really want to this. Main reasons for wanting it are: feel depressed, find it harder than you think you should to do some things (eg ask people for directions). Its good to know your motivation for doing this before doing so.

1. Make a change in your lifestyle and/or circumstances. Examples include but not limited to: change of environment (move houses, change schools/job, start working out)
2. Recognise the patterns of thought that you go through when in a position of shyness. Try to come up with some opposing thoughts to those (was very hard for me). When you get the urges to think the negative thoughts about yourself
3. If you start feeling less shy and whatever you're doing is working
4. ??? 
5. Profit.

I went to a restaurant, by tradition, hands out fishing rods to those waiting to be seated so they can fish in the nearby water while they waited.  I was handed a rod, and took it across the street to the water, which seemed like a lake, though instead of a gradual shore, it went deep immediately at the edge, I noticed the line on the rod split about a foot or two from the end and had two large hooks, I realized I had caught a large mouth bass on one hook and a sea turtle on the other.  With both the sea turtle and bass still in the water I reached down to try and free the sea turtle as I didn’t want to hurt it any more than I already had. As I was struggling to free the turtle, and then watched the shark eat the sea turtle as well.  After both had been eaten

I feel like feminists are overdramatic.  I get the sense they feel like all men are out to get women and think of women as pure sex objects

For instance, but the feminist group on campus rallied the troops to paint another message next to it saying this is an example of ""rape culture"" and that women are oppressed because of this picture.  Having a WTF look on my face, I googled the term and saw it meant portraying sexualized violence as acceptable.  This had absolutely nothing to do with what the hockey team did.

I know someone who takes the opportunity to every joking comment about women on Facebook to decry how men are pigs and women need help overcoming the evil world awaiting them.  I cringe every time I see that she's commented on something because she takes everything to a whole new level.

I'm a strong supporter of equal treatment and think proactive steps should be taken to make sure opportunities are the same for everyone.  But when things like this happen
