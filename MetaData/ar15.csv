Stopped by my LGS and saw they had Pmags in stock…So I bought all 20!

I was really surprised to see my LGS had ARs in stock
 
Stopped by my local Wal-Mart and found they had 440 round lots of .223 ammo in stock, went back in and bought another three!

Hooray for all of you and thanks for being part of the problem. I haven’t shot my AR since before the madness hit and since I’m not a prepper, stock levels could stabilize, prices would begin to recede, and all of us could get back to shooting and enjoying our rifles. Imagine if all the online companies had time to catch up on order processing and shipping. Those magazines, BCGs, or uppers you ordered in December might actually get to you before July. Ok, so you’re not on board with a complete moratorium on purchasing. How about this; the next time you are at your LGS, Wal-Mart, magazines or spare parts in stock, you know that most of us are not using cash to buy all this stuff…

Almost a year ago I saw that Knesek was selling the Remington RGP upper. I emailed them and ask if it they had any in stock

So I sent them a check for the full amount

Late last year I wrote Remington asking about the RGP upper and rifle itself- since no one else is selling them. Not online like Knesek Guns

I forwarded the emails Knesek, but they will keep 45% of my funds since I'm cancelling. However- I'm not cancelling. It's just not for sale. 

They wouldn't even entertain the idea of buying something else in stock. $1538 can buy a nice pistol and shotgun- other items they sell. 

The owner, minus the 45% since they have put some effort in this issue.  

It's just unacceptable. 

BBB has been trying to work with them- however the only response Knesek gave was that they have the RGP uppers coming in. Of course they provide no evidence with this


So Knesek Gun Inc has basically stolen my money.


This isn't as if I am bored of the wait and have am complaining. Spikes Tactical- I ordered a lower from them around the time I bought the upper. ST said it would be about 6 months

What Knesek Gun has done is fraud and theft. I strongly advise- Do not ever buy from them

I'm adding the last emails from myself to Larry Knesek

So

Do not send checks. Had I used my card

Do not be so eager to buy a sexy product (The RGP is sexy in my opinion) that when you see only one company selling it

Knesek Guns is terrible place to purchase anything from.



(From me)
I feel you are being obtuse on purpose, therefore your company cannot fulfill this order. This is the reason no local gun stores are attempting to sell the Remington upper, and cannot be found anywhere online. Its the reason Remington are not selling it themselves. Again, the company itself has confirmed it the Remington RPG upper that I paid for is not on the market.

I'll be contacting better business bureau in Arkansas




(Larry Knesek)
I take it by the language of the email meaning you do not want to proceed with the order. Me and my staff have and will be here for any questions. We have contacted the manufacturer again and they have guaranteed that we will be getting them. I must warn you, and that you are not illegally purchasing this? If you want to go this route. I will be issuing you a refund check per our terms and conditions. Any further communications will be considered harassment and handled appropriately. ",,False,self,t5_2reap,False,,

1346340624.0,z2xbp,Upper receiver terminology explained,Shady14,89,14,19,"Welcome to the wonderful world of the AR-15. Chances are if you are reading this in the subreddit

Here's some very basic terminology and info for those of you that are trying to get started. I'll make a similar post

Unless you have a large complement of gunsmithing tools and the technical knowledge to build an upper



*Upper Receiver*

* **M4 feed ramps** - allows for better feeding from magazines. Highly recommended
* **MPI/HPT** - QC measures
* **A2 Upper** - this upper will have a carry handle that is built into the upper. 
* **A4 upper** - this is a flat top upper receiver. allows flexibility.

*Length (of gas system):*

* **Rifle Length** - Gasblock pinned around 13 or so inches. takes 12 inch handguards and rails. 
* **Midlength** - gasblock pinned around 10 inches. Takes 9 inch handguards. Allows best cycling of bolt.
* **Carbine(m4)** - gasblock pinned around 8 inches. takes 7 inch handguards. a bit harsher recoil. Military standard.

*Length(of most widely available barrels)*

* **20 inch**  - standard for m16. Highest velocity. Almost always a rifle length gas system
* **16 inch** - most widely distributed. Great compromise between velocity and length.  
* **14.5 inch** - standard for military m4's. These are only available to civilians(without a tax stamp) if the flash hider is pinned to the barrel
* **11.5

*Barrel terminology*

* **CHF** - cold hammer forged. should be more durable
*  **Button rifled/CMV/regular** - button rifled. perfectly fine for all intents and purposes. Military standard.
*  **Chrome lined** - the interior of the barrel is coated with hard chrome. This allows quicker cleaning and longer barrel life. However
* **Twist** - this denotes the amount of inches the rifling takes to rotate once, and either twist will fire these fine. However, for super-accurate heavy match ammo, (69gr, 77gr) A 1:7 twist is needed.

*Barrel Profile*

* **Heavy** - heavy barrel. slowest to heat up
* **a2 profile/unlisted** - medium barrel. medium attributes. Military Standard.
* **lightweight** - lighter. good compromise between pencil and a2
* **pencil** - super thin barrel. Heats up quickly

*Bolt carrier group/assembly*

* **MPI/HPT** - this means the bolt has been magnetic particle inspected and high pressure tested. This does not make your bolt carrier better
* **Semi-auto/Commercial/civilian Bolt Carrier** - this is a commercialized version of a bolt carrier group made specifically for civilian markets. It has material removed from the bottom rear.
* **Full Auto/m16/milspec bolt carrier group**  - this is the military's version of a BCG. It is heavier
*  **Chrome** these BCG's are made out of hard chrome. They are not neccessary
* **Chromed/Nib-X** these are regular BCG's that are plated with chrome

*Charging handle*

* These are somewhat self explanatory

*Muzzle Devices:*

* **Flash Hiders** - minimize flash or signature at the tip of the weapon. The standard is the A2
* **Muzzle Brakes and Compensators** - Muzzle brakes reduce felt recoil

*Chambering:* 

* **.223 Remington** - 223 remington is the civilianized version of the 5.56x45 nato. It is a lower pressure round and slightly differentiated in case design. 
* **5.56x45 nato** - the military version of .223. Higher pressure.
* **YOU CAN SHOOT .223 OUT OF A 5.56 RIFLE. IT IS NOT ADVISED THAT YOU DO THE INVERSE**

*Sights*

* **Iron Sights** - I extremely strongly suggest that anyone who buys an ar-15 practice the hell out of using their iron sights. Not only is it fun
* **Red Dots** - Big names are Aimpoint, Mepro. These are all extremely expensive options, but worth the money if you are into it. Pick which one you like and empty the wallet. **ALTERNATIVELY** if you want a cheap option, pick up a Vortex or Primary Arms clone. They aren't for combat, but they hold up very well and don't lose zero.
* **Scopes** - You should know what a scope is. Please keep in mind that the max effective range for an ar-15 is about 600 meters(for most of us)
* **Back up/flip up iron sights** - this is a good option for those running red dots. This allows you to run a RDS

My recommendation for a first timer

* Upper: Flat top(A4)
* Chamber - 5.56x45 Nato
* Muzzle Device - A2 Flash hider
* Sights - Iron Sights 
* Barrel: 16 inch
* Gas system: midlength
* Twist: 1:7
* Chrome Lined: Yes
* Profile: A2/Standard
* Button rifled or CHF: Either - both are fine. CHF is more expensive but more durable. 
* Bolt Carrier Group: Full auto/m16/mil spec
* Charging handle: Large paddle. Name Brand


I'm sure I've missed or made mistakes on a few things

I hope this helps the noobs out there - please feel free to PM me any questions or leave them here.

1359358585.0,17f2t8,.223 vs 5.56 ammunition. What you dont know could hurt you.,OurFlagsTurnRed,72,12,18,"223 REMINGTON VS 5 56 NATO:

WHAT YOU DON’T KNOW COULD HURT YOU

By: Human Events 2/15/2011 03:01 AM

Is firing a 5.56 NATO cartridge in your .223 Remington chambered AR15 dangerous? Or do Internet forum-ninjas and ammunition companies selling you commercial ammo instead of surplus overstate the dangers? Believe it or not

The Cartridges

The .223 Remington and 5.56×45 NATO cartridges are very similar

The 5.56 case has thicker walls to handle higher pressures

Some 5.56 loads have a slightly longer overall length than commercial .223 loads.

The Chambers

The significant difference between the .223 Rem and 5.56 NATO lies in the rifles, leade, will be different in each rifle.

The leade is the area of the barrel in front of the chamber prior to where the rifling begins. This is where the loaded bullet is located when a cartridge is chambered. The leade is frequently called the “throat.”

On a .223 Remington spec rifle, or almost double the leade of the .223 rifle.

A shorter leade in a SAAMI spec rifle creates a situation where the bullet in a 5.56 NATO round, chamber pressure can be dramatically increased, creating the danger of a ruptured case or other cartridge/gun failure.

The reverse situation, so a slight loss in velocity and accuracy may be experienced, but there is not a danger of increased pressures and subsequent catastrophic failure.

How serious is the danger of firing 5.56 ammo in .223 guns? Dangerous enough that the SAAMI lists 5.56 military ammo as being not for use in .223 firearms in the technical data sheet titled “Unsafe Firearm-Ammunition Combinations.”

ATK, ATK stated using 5.56 ammo in a .223 rifle could result in “…primer pocket gas leaks, blown cartridge case heads, and gun functioning issues.”

However,” and they have not had any catastrophic failures.

According to ArmaLite:

“Occasionally a non-standard round (of generally imported) ammunition will fit too tightly in the leade

What Do You Have?

So

Many match rifles are chambered in .223 Remington (SAAMI specs) for tighter tolerances

Many of the AR-15’s currently sold on the market are made for the 5.56 NATO cartridge. If you own one of these

However

“It is our understanding that commercially available AR15’s and M16’s – although some are stamped 5.56 Rem on the receiver – are manufactured with .223 chambers.”

So

As if the confusion regarding the .223 vs 5.56 chambers wasn’t enough, but maintains tighter tolerances for better accuracy.

Yeah

Here’s the bottom line. If you want to follow the safest possible course,,False,self,t5_2reap,False,,True

Pics:
http://imgur.com/NJ37V

http://imgur.com/ELadA

http://imgur.com/PdWSA


Parts:
PSA 16"" Barrel

Mega Forged Upper/Lower

PSA LPK

Magpul MOE grip and trigger guard

Magpul STR stock

Midwest Industries 15"" Freefloat quad rail

Primary Arms 4-16x Illuminated scope + mount

YHM low profile gas block



Build thoughts:
I have nearly 0 firearms experience. I've shot handguns less then a handful of times


My biggest issue was getting my low profile gas block on the barrel. At first I thought I got the wrong size, a little grease on the barrel and a 30 second ballet of oven mitts, gas tubes and a soft mallet got it on nicely.


The only other issue I ran into was after full assembly


Edit: One other thing I ran into was the screw into the grip not going all the way in. I was semi-prepared for that as I read in some reviews the yellow loctite that Magpul puts on the screw needs to come off. I ran into that but I knew just what to do. Funny part was I had helped someone out a week ago with that issue on the forum!



Vendor Thoughts:
I pieced everything together over about 2 months from a few different vendors. Some I had really good experiences through and some were terrible.


Riflegear.com - Got my lower from them


Arctic Shooting Supply - Bought my upper from them. I went through EVERY distributor on Mega Arms site, but under construction. The first time I went there, it said to place and order and call in, but there were no phone numbers lol. The next day it had them up. You place an order online then call in your payment. No online method of checking orders or getting tracking -_- but they were helpful via phone. Good experience if you can tolerate the interesting ordering method.


Palmetto State Armory - These guys have great prices, or they need more staff but my first order took 5 business days to ship, and my 2nd took 7 days. These guys were the only ones that didn't ship the day after I placed an order. Loved everything I got from them though.


Brownell's and Midway USA - Both of these guys were exactly the same


Primary Arms - Got my scope and mount from here. After some reviews from the guys on AR15.com I decided on the 4-16x Illuminated from PA. I went to place my order and found out they didn't take Amex, with a solution. Placed the order as a money order type, sent paypal, emailed him back and I got confirmation in a few minutes and he told me it would ship the next day and it did. Scope feels and looks great. Wonderful tactile clicks, great finish, clear glass. Because of Marshall's above and beyond, I wouldn't hesitate to look to these guys for anything I need to purchase in the future. Great small business


Mega Arms - These guys were straight up awesome. They couldn't tell me who might have some in stock but they were super nice


EDIT: Some other things I wanted to put in here but forgot about
Here are a few links that were invaluable to me.


ITS has a full video series on a step by step build. I watched it a few times before I even had any parts in hand.
http://www.itstactical.com/warcom/firearms/diy-ar-15-build-introduction-parts-and-tools-required/

CMMG has a great video on building a lower. I didn't have any hitches using this and I think it only took me about 2x as long as the video.

Ultimate Reloader has a great video specifically for installing the Midwest Industries handguards that I had. This helped make it tremendously easy. If you're going MI

Got to take it out on Friday…Here are my thoughts!

-	Was a bright and hot day.  Flip the bugger on
-	Time to start the zeroing process…. All this was done at the 50yd range.  I’d gotten it somewhat close at home by “zeroing” it as best as I could with my irons, drop the bolt, send 3 downrange, making sure dot is centered on target.  All this was done at the 50yd range
-	Check the spotting scope, though….make some dramatic adjustments since I don’t feel like counting the clicks.  
-	Next 3…oops!  Way overcompensated, as opposed to 11…ok, I’m going to start counting my clicks [peers through spotting scope, approximates the needed adjustment, make adjustment]
-	Send 3 more…getting better here.  Moved about the expected amount.  Not quite dead center
-	Then it dawns on me…I’m steady handed, consistent sight picture, why the hell are my groups not tighter?  Drop the mag, clear the chamber, and take a look.  Mount has come loose, and is a bit wobbly on the rail.  OK, simple enough
-	A few more rounds, then they open back up.  Shit.  Loose mount again.  Motherfucker.
-	OK
-	Few more rounds, fuck it. Got it close enough for today, it’s like 100* out, wife is ready to go, and I’m not going to get a solid zero with a loose mount, and don’t feel like dealing with it.
-	I’ll be going back out on this coming Friday to finish up at 50 yards with the mount nice and tight

So I got home, as I don’t plan on removing it, but it quickly renders a “Quick Detach” mount non-functioning, and is now a “permanent”  mount because the lever used to detach won’t budge with the nut being tightened.  

******EDIT**** /u/primaryarms has replied and informed that this isn't a QD mount

All in all, it did.  Didn’t really determine that 1 click = ¼” at 100 yards, but it’s close enough…should know for sure(ish) next time I go out).  The mount left something to be desired, but I’m not upset about it.  For the money spent, I feel like I got a solid deal.  Had the mount completely shit the bucket on me, I may be singing a different tune, but at the end of the day, the PA sight is totally a rockin value for the cost; just beware that the QD mount may not be that ""QD-ish"".  

TL;DR: Sight is great value, and would either grab a different QD mount, or just get a permanent mount.

Have any of you been in situations where your significant other was against you building at AR-15? How did you convince them? Did you use resources or references? 

I plan on taking my wife out shooting with me so that she can understand the firearm and safe handling of guns.  I also would like her to take a class with me so that we can both better educated.

Demanding that politicians take some sort of firearm education course could help mitigate unnecessary legislation and help we law-abiding citizens preserve our 2nd amendment rights without constant interference from ignorant fearmongering.  There have been multiple instances where politicians have come out and brazenly spoken with authority on firearms and their dangers without really knowing much about them.

For instance, yet instead of taking the time as our representatives to educate themselves on what is one of the hottest topics in the country and becoming knowledgeable, they choose to live in ignorant bliss, using reactionary and uninformed methods of pandering to their constituents and supporters.

Politicians have set forth a multitude of mandatory citizen education courses and certifications that help ensure that we are conducting ourselves in a manner that is in keeping with responsible and lawful practices.  It only stands to reason that as people who are hired by us, represent us and make decisions that ultimately affect us, that we should have the right to demand they educate themselves in their job field, just as they demand truck drivers, liquor servers, CHL carriers, and a list of other professions be trained and certified.  

Firearm education for politicians seems like it would at the very least be a good start toward responsible

I've been wanting an 5.56 carbine for a while and decided that a completed one would be best for me. As much as I'd love to build own piece by piece

I was in the market for either a high-end AR or a SCAR 16S. I shot the SCAR and loved it; truly a fantastic weapon. For ARs I looked at Daniel Defense, LaRue and Colt but only fired Colts as that's what the range had. I decided to go to the local gun show this Saturday with the intent of walking out with a rifle. I did.

I handled the SCAR again but ultimately decided I'd have more fun playing with the AR modular platform. Looking at and handling the ARs side by side, with the Daniel Defense edging out the other two from a fit standpoint (AR slop, etc.).

After some serious consideration

* The M4A1 Carbine rollmark is pretty badass
* This rifle is as close as you can get to a SOPMOD Block II out of the box
* The collector value of the Colt should be superior to the others and intend to have this for a long time

The other rifles were absolutely superb, but it ticked the boxes in a way that only this model could.

For now

UPDATE: I put 40 rounds through it at the local indoor range. No surprises. The stock is WAY too short for me as expected and I even hit my cheek with the charging handle a few times (I'm 6'4"" and really had to cock my head with the short draw).

Recently I decided to make my life MUCH easier and bought some decent starter tools for AR-15 assembly. I'm hoping this thread will help people that are starting to assemble their own ARs and I hope to learn from experienced builders here. 

I already owned a Weaver Gunsmith Tool Set that included: Drive punch set, Screwdriver with a ton of bits and a ""punch block."" I inherited this from a good friend and use it daily.

http://www.amazon.com/Weaver-Deluxe-Gunsmith-Tool-Kit/dp/B004NC188O/ref=sr_1_3?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368591121&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=weaver+screwdriver+set

Here's a list of tools that I've acquired to help me work on AR-15/AR-10 platform guns as well as others.:

 - Schuster Roll Pin Starter Punch Set: These two starters make putting the lower roll pins

http://www.midwayusa.com/product/694883/schuster-ar-15-roll-pin-starter-punch-set-2-piece-steel

 - Sears Craftsman 6pc. Roll Pin Punch Set: These are to finish pushing the roll pins in without slipping/mushrooming the pins.

http://www.sears.com/craftsman-6-pc-roll-pin-punch-set/p-00943167000P

 - 6pc Drive Punches from Harbor Freight: These are okay for starting off

 - Model 1 Pivot pin installation tool: For $4 you simply cannot beat this tool... I wanted the Wheeler Engineering version

http://www.midwayusa.com/product/920248/model-1-pivot-pin-detent-installation-tool-ar-15

 - Upper receiver block: This thing works pretty well

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007LDRXWW/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1

 - Lower receiver/mag block: Great for tightening down castle nuts

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005J13VCO/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1

 - Tapco/Intrafuse AR-15 Armorer's Wrench: It's nice and has many features that are all labeled by stamping or engraving... the one marked ""BEER"" is a bottle opener

http://www.amazon.com/Tapco-Intrafuse-AR-Armorers-Tool/dp/B006PTMYHM/ref=sr_1_1?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368590041&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=tapco+armorers+tool

 - US Peacekeeper Small Punch Roll: Very nice way to organize tools for the bench and on the go. It keeps all the AR-15 and pistol tools nice and tidy in my range bag. 

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044YGCA0/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1


The only other tools I keep in my bag are a Nylon/Brass hammer &amp; a Lyman screwdriver with common bits in the handle.

I hope you guys can use some of this info for future use... any suggestions are welcome.

---
From Magpul's Facebook:
---

Apparently Gov Hickenlooper has announced that he will sign HB 1224 on Wednesday. We were asked for our reaction

We have said all along that based on the legal problems and uncertainties in the bill, and we will prioritize moving magazine manufacturing operations first. We expect the first PMAGs to be made outside CO within 30 days of the signing, with the rest to follow in phases. We will likely become a multi-state operation as a result of this move, and not all locations have been selected. We have made some initial contacts and evaluated a list of new potential locations for additional manufacturing and the new company headquarters, and we will begin talks with various state representatives in earnest if the Governor indeed signs this legislation. Although we are agile for a company of our size, it is still a significant footprint, and we will perform this move in a manner that is best for the company and our employees. 

It is disappointing to us that money and a social agenda from outside the state have apparently penetrated the American West to control our legislature and Governor, and the 2014 election to undo these wrongs against responsible Citizens.

1372014854.0,1gx7hi,"Could /r/ar15 clear up the ""Best Choices for Self Defense Ammo"" section on .223/5.56mm?",Ghett0blasterX,33,5,36,"[The referenced document here] (http://www.ar15.com/ammo/project/Self_Defense_Ammo_FAQ/index.htm#.223)

My AR is my dedicated home defense carbine, it'd be pretty hypocritical if I weren't willing to shell out for my first line of defense in the home. 

Reading over the ""best ammo for self defense"" article

* Hornady 75gr OTM loads

* Nosler 77gr OTM loads

* Sierra 77gr SMK loads

OTM I've gathered to mean Open-Tip Match, Nosler, and Sierra. The only exact match I've found for any of those rounds is the [Hornady 75gr BTHP](http://www.hornady.com/store/223-Rem-75-gr-BTHP-Match/) in .223, but the only place I've seen it available is running nearly $2/round. 

Conversely, [Colt 77gr SMK 5.56](http://www.midwayusa.com/product/665749/colt-match-ammunition-556x45mm-nato-77-grain-sierra-matchking-hollow-point-boat-tail-box-of-20) (which I am eyeing in particular), and several retailers selling [Norma 77gr SMK .223](http://www.midwayusa.com/product/224324/norma-usa-match-ammunition-223-remington-77-grain-sierra-matchking-hollow-point-boat-tail-box-of-20) .  

Does the list, Sierra, and Nosler *loadings* of .223? As in, these manufacturers specifically load cartridges calibrated for home defense over match shooting, just using the same bullets? Is there a meaningful difference between an actual Nosler or Sierra-branded cartridges (if such things even exist? as best I can tell Sierra only makes bullets) and the items I've listed above? If not, I'd probably pick up 200 rounds of one of them to make sure they feed nicely and to keep at the ready.",,self,,

I live in Northern Ireland and unlike most of the rest of the UK, as long as a firearm has a barrel of less than 30cm and an OAL of under 60cm, its considered a handgun in the eyes of the law. So, as long as I can keep an AR under those maximums, I can have one. I'd like to go .300 blk since it performs so well out of a short barrel. I'll also be pinning the stock in the closed position. I know of another guy who is doing something similar right now and someone else who just got a slightly modified semi auto MP5k (with a slightly shorter stock) this way.

Its sort of like how the guys in the mainland UK get around the handgun ban with long barrel revolvers that are just over the legal minimum length

/u/whubbard has already been kind enough to give me some measurements
