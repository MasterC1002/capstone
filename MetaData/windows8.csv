Help them.  If you hate Windows 8

Now for my story.  I hope this helps those that hate Windows 8.  I’m 50 this year.  I’ve been fascinated by electronics since I was six.  I grew up in the late 60’s and 70’s.  I remember my first transistor radio

Needless to say, I pulled the hard drive out and went back to my favorite version of Windows.  Windows 7!!!

A few weeks later, my Outlook?  What about my business ERP system?  You know, the one I use to run my damn business?  I need a tool, not a toy to run my business.  Play time is nice, but work comes first or we go hungry.  I know, I’m old school….seems like some people think that play time comes first, but not in my world

So, or the trash can….whichever you prefer, never to be seen again.  One thing I forgot to mention, I’m also the IT guy and I do computer repair on the side.  I’m asked all the time “I want to upgrade to this Windows 8 thing, should I do it?”  Of which my reply has been an astounding NO!!!  Get the crucifix, the holy water, a hammer and a stake.  Kill it, kill it.  But never say never!  There comes a time when we all have to upgrade our “stuff” and that time has come for me.  So, I downloaded and installed the Windows 8 Enterprise trial.  Ok, I tried this with Windows 8 and to my surprise

Saturday, let’s try that.  Pretty straight forward and I’ve got some new tiles on my start screen.  Let’s try Excel.  Ok, there’s Excel and my desktop.  Now I’m starting to feel better.  Where’s the start button?  Oh yeah, there’s not one.  How do I get back to the start screen to open Outlook?  Time for Google again.  Are you seeing a pattern here?  Search the internet!!

Those of you that love Windows 8
 
Now, even if we can’t see or hear it.  Now get out there and search for the information you need.  I can’t stress this enough, LEARN SOMETHING NEW.  It will not kill you.  My first piece of advice is to find a keyboard short cut list.  It’s the most handy thing you’ll find.  The other thing is that this new start screen is just a big start menu that you can customize and make look pretty and hopefully make your work easier.  Once you figure out that the start screen is just a huge version of the start menu, things will start to click.  I don’t have much use for the apps and live tiles (you can remove them) but, everything else works pretty well.

So, Saturday night, Sunday and Sunday night, I had a pretty good grip on this new Windows 8 thing.  You’ve got to give it more than 30 minutes time and you actually have to learn something, a different way of doing some things.  It’s not harder or more cumbersome, and in some ways is actually easier than the old ways.  Some things seem to just “flow” better.  I’ve been using Windows 8 for a couple of months now and I can say that I’m not a Windows 8 hater anymore and I’ve been recommending it to anyone that asks.  I’m not quite in the “love” category yet, but I do enjoy using Windows 8 and it will work for my business.  I do recommend that the “haters” give it an honest try and the “lovers” should help to convert, so we need to get along and help each other.

TLDR:  I used to hate Windows 8

I don't see why windows 8 is getting a bunch of negative press.

Every program I used in windows 7 works exactly the same in Windows 8.

The learning curve wasn't anything daunting. Navigating with a mouse using the corners of the screen is great and speedy. The apps are cool

I was also surprised at the ease of upgrading from windows 7 (and a non legit copy at that). I thought it was going to be an endless barrage of errors and incompatibilities

Both my boot time (from completely off to login screen) and my shutdown time were cut about exactly in half.

W7 boot: ~45 seconds

W8 boot: ~22 seconds

W7 shutdown: ~12 seconds

W8 shutdown: ~6 seconds

I had to go out to best buy and pick up a new laptop pronto so I could continue to be mobile and work when needed.  I ended up buying two cheap $400-ish PCs

At first I was really frustrated with the Windows 8 experience.  I got a copy of Windows 7 to run on my HP off of our company MSDN account and I installed Ubuntu on my Toshiba.  

It has been an excruciating month

This last week

Now, install Office 2010, disable hot corners, etc.  This time around I decided to give it a fair shot on how it was supposed to be used.  I ended up really enjoying the experience!

The metro apps were great for casual consumption (the news app is great and I think I actually like it better than my previous favorite news aggregate app, in a *good* way!) and the everything feels a bit faster.

I think a lot of the hate I've seen (and experienced) came from people coming from Windows 7 to an update with no Aero and also people not warming up to the concept of keyboard shortcuts.  Aero looks great

Just got my Mac back today and I just don't like the experience as much.  I think I'm going to sell my Mac and apple supplies and get a really nice Windows 8 laptop with an IPS screen.  I have yet to try touchscreen functionality except on some of the demos at best buy and I simply don't think I'm part of the core audience for that. But the rest of the OS I'm really thrilled with, and I just really ended up enjoying and preferring the Windows 8 experience to other OSs on the market.

Anyone else come to Windows 8 completely hating it and then came to the same positive conclusion about using it for a length of time?

I've been using this OS for the last seven-ish months (since Consumer Preview) and I want to highlight a few points that make me question the role of the Modern UI on an actual PC.  Am I wrong here

**The Metro UI is a step backwards for multitasking.** 

* You should be allowed to resize things in any arrangement that suits you.  The Metro UI can only show two apps per monitor.  Now, you probably like to have some sort of reference material on one side and something you're 'creating' on the other.  Why must snapping be limited to the rule of thirds??  Have you ever tried this with IE10 or Chrome?  The text shrinks down to ant-size.  I was so excited to see that Microsoft was going to find a way to deal with the recent abundance of horizontal real-estate that widescreens have created.  But this isn't working for me.
*  Changing focus shouldn't suspend an app unless it makes sense for the app to be suspended.  Don't get me wrong

**Metro apps are underpowered or underfeatured**.  Why does my laptop get so much hotter when I run Chrome in ""Windows 8 Mode?""  Why can't the Metro IE10 display certain websites with flash?  Why haven't we seen an official app from _any_ of the social networks?

**Microsoft's own apps are the biggest source of confusion**.

* Why are there two Control Panels?  And if you're gonna have two Control Panels
* Why are the Metro versions of Mail, including Outlook and OneNote!  If Microsoft is so gung-ho about Metro, why didn't they include _any_ Metro apps in Office?",,False,self,t5_2s692,,http://www.reddit.com/r/windows8/comments/17ti2x/can_we_discuss_the_role_or_purpose_of_the_modern/

* ""Windows 8 starts in the start menu and I have to make an extra click to get to the desktop.""

Unless you are going to the desktop to just view the wallpaper


* ""The new mail/calendar/messaging metro apps suck.""

They are not as feature rich as the Office programs, which works just fine.  Also, Outlook uses the metro notification system as well.


* ""Turning off the computer is too difficult!""

In windows 7, you click the settings button on the charm bar, then click power, then shutdown.  Or, you can press win+i and then power and shutdown.


* ""There is no clock when using Metro Apps.""

You can view the clock multiple ways.  You can move your mouse to the bottom right corner


* ""I can't just find my programs like the start menu in windows 7""

To find your apps, it is that simple.


* ""The new menu bar in explorer is horrible.""

You don't have to have the menu bar visible.  You just need to click the up arrow in the upper right corner of the bar to hide it forever.  You can of course reveal it later by pressing that same button.  If you actually want to use it


* ""The new desktop theme looks horrible.""

The new theme help try to bridge the gap between windows 7's Aero UI and the new Modern UI.  It does miss some aspects, once it is officially released on Oct 26th, people will start to create new themes for it.


Now I will list all of the new features that I have found that help benefit it above Windows 7.

-Native ISO mounting

-More features/options in explorer

-Better performance

-Smaller footprint on disc

-Faster Searching

-Better touch and gesture support

-More keyboard short-cuts

-System Settings/Personalization sync between PC's

-Better Start Menu management.  (Couldn't customize look of start menu in 7

-Better Multi-Monitor support

-Built-in anti-virus protection

-Task Manager is much more informative and easier to use

-Faster Boot Time

-Easier Licensing system

-Hyper-V

**Desktop:**

* Like many others I thought I would hate not having a start button

* I have a dual monitor set up and I have it so my start screen (and all Windows Apps) to open on the secondary monitor only. My main monitor is almost always just the desktop unless I'm watching Netflix 

* I have never had a slight problem with Steam or any of my games. I had them all saved on one of my hard drives

* I do find the charms menu to be bit annoying at times

* Booting up my computer is crazy fast now which is nice

* Final thoughts: I like Windows 8 on my desktop, especially when you set it up the way you want. 

**Laptop (Lenovo Yoga 13):**  

* I'll try to keep this more about Windows 8 than the laptop itself (which is great by the way) 

* Windows 8 with a touchscreen laptop is AWESOME. I love it. This is clearly the way it was meant to be. 
* Unlike with my Desktop, and honestly quicker than if I were to use the icons from the taskbar in Desktop mode. 
* Using the multitasking options is nice
* Again
* Final Thoughts: Compared to using it on my desktop, Windows 8 is good on my desktop, I don't feel any hindrance when using it, and it does actually make things easier in some respects. However, on a touchscreen device its clearly better. You can take full advantage of what Windows 8 has to offer, and once the app ecosystem gets better (hopefully is does!) it'll be even better. 

TL;DR - I like Windows 8 on my desktop. I love Windows 8 on my touchscreen laptop.

/r/etro is our attempt to build a fast, commenting, jumping to a subreddit you're not subscribed to, saving/hiding, submitting links, etc. 

We also thought a ton about making the app as usable as possible. We didn't like how having an upvote and downvote button on every comment looked; but we didn't want to force the user to click on a comment and then vote up or down. We added this nifty little feature where if you just tap (or click) on the solid bar on the left side of the comment we'll upvote or downvote the comment (we even color in the bar with orangered or blue so you know what you've done). No need to put a click between you and the person you need to downvote into oblivion :)

We also added support for drafts. I tend to write something, and submit it later. In /r/etro, when you compose a comment you have the option to save as a draft. The comment sits in the thread where we'd post it and lets you indecisive redditors go back and decide when you want to subject your masterpiece to the horde.

My co-developer tends to browse reddit by opening a ton of links in tabs and then reading all those stories at once. Most reddit apps force you to read articles one by one. If you're like my friend

We also added the ability to navigate through the interface with VIM directional commands. Because... yeah

We also custom designed the home screen to fill one purpose

We also allow you to collapse titles and comment threads with a double tap or click.

One bit of feedback we saw from some people was that they wanted a dark theme and for the app to be really readable (more people than I thought wanted to reddit on their tv) so we optimized everything for fingers and mice. Text is large and readable

Since our app got lost in certification and it ended up taking 21 days, etc. There are a ton of little changes happening then too, but these are the biggest ones.

I hope you'll give the app a try! The Windows Store listing is below..

[What does a custom Metro screen look like?](http://i.imgur.com/zHxTo.png)  Image courtesy of CapnCrunch10.

**The Guide**

First

Before you start making tiles, a 30x30 icon, larger icons can be used, this may cause distortions of the icon. A good idea is to have your icons and OblyTile in the same folder, this will save time on navigation.

Now, get back into Metro and start organizing your icons. You can further your sweet [ass-grid](https://xkcd.com/37/) by adding group names to the top of the group. To do this, you need to zoom out in Metro (CTRL+Scroll Wheel or +/-) and right click on a group.

**OblyTile input fields explained.**

* Tile Name is what you will see in plain text over the tile.
* Hide Tile Name will hide the plain text name if you wish to only see the icon.
* Program Path is the path to open the executable file.
* Program Arguments are commands the program will take into account while open
* Tile Image is the large image you see in Metro
* Tile Small image is what you see when you zoom out in Metro (CTRL+Scroll Wheel or +/-)
* Tile Background Color set the background of your icon. This will be the background of open space from you icon (transparent areas
* Run as administrator will make the tile launch the application with administrator permissions.

**Shell Folders**

These folder are unique in the sense they con't have a direct path (such as Computer, etc) When you create a new icon, set the Program Path to ""C:\Windows\explorer.exe"" (or whever windows is installed) then set the Program Arguments to [one of these arguments](http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/shell-commands-to-access-the-special-folders/). If you wish to have an icon to a specific folder or drive, just use the path to its location.

**Power Buttons**

This is a list of the *program path*::*program arguments* for the tile to work properly.
 
* Shutdown Computer: shutdown.exe **:::** -s /hybrid -t 00
* Restart Computer: shutdown.exe **:::** -r -t 00
* Log off Computer: shutdown.exe **:::** -l (Note: that is a lowercase L)
* Hibernate Computer: C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe **:::** powrProf.dll
* Sleep Computer: C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe **:::** powrprof.dll,0
* Lock Workstation: C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe **:::** User32.dll

Read this!,ross456,35,1,22,"It seems like Lenovo configured the Yoga slightly incorrectly - they did not configure the touch screen (which is internally connected via USB 2.0) to disable selective suspending, and any touch data received in this time period is lost. Not a big deal if you're tapping the screen

The solution is to disable selective suspend for the touch screen, but I haven't noticed a significant change personally. And you can always change it back!

The way to disable it is a simple registry change. Make the change below

If you're interested in more information

This information applies to other Intel touch-enabled computers as well

**How to test if you are affected by this:**

1. Close all applications
2. Touch the computer's screen.
3. Count to 10
4. Try to perform an edge swipe.

If it works, follow the instructions below.

**Registery Change:**

1. Open regedit.exe and navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USB`.
2. There should then be a key named `VID_04F3&amp;PID_000A` (along with some other similar-looking keys). This key represents the USB touch controller. Open it.
3. There should be one key under the previous one. On my system, then click `DeviceParameters`.
4. There should be a key named `SelectiveSuspendEnabled` whose value is `1`. Set its value to `0`.
5. Restart!
6. Follow my above instructions again to verify the problem is gone.

Let me know if this helps you! It made my Yoga about 1000x more enjoyable once I made the change.

EDIT: As /u/miguelos pointed out, making the C: drive 100GB (when I ran it right after getting the Yoga, I was left with around 75GB free after default applications and the OS).

1352600610.0,12zpoe,A look at the Zune software vs XBox music; or why XBox music blows ,Scythels,37,8,18,"This post is only concerned with the ways the two softwares allow you to interact with your music library

Let's start by taking a look at the Zune software's 'home' screen for me

[I'm greeted with a smart and effective 3-column design.](http://imgur.com/a/2tgwW#0) Some pieces of album art didn't make it over and were substituted with the cloud art (that is wrong) or received no art at all.  That's fine, really well on a desktop.  They hold a ton of information and are really space-effective.  If I start typing, it starts automatically bringing me to what I was typing for, so if I type ""Guilt"" in, I am brought to Guilt Machine automatically as I have no other music involving the word Guilt, if it finds nothing it brings me to search results.  

[Now, and generally very poor usability.  

Now, AC/DC) expecting a set of tiles with letters on them that I could tap to jump to that letter come up.  Nope, you have to scroll.  Meaning if you have a larger library, it's a bitch to navigate.  The visual cue is [there](http://imgur.com/a/2tgwW#3) just like it is on the Zune HD, but the functionality is not.  

Now

Oh yeah, this isn't an issue.  But for me, it's usage breaking.  I know what I want to listen to when I go into my player and I've formed a habit of going artist -&gt; album -&gt; play first song and the album starts playing.  On XBM I need to go albums -&gt; sort by artist and then get to [here](http://imgur.com/a/2tgwW#11) just so I can get the album I want.  It takes far longer and is much less precise.  I get that XBM is developed for touch too, but for mouse+keyboard this sucks.  But wait, it says that a bunch of those albums are ""Rock"" while the rest are metal operas.  This is peculiar, because those albums have metadata that says [they are in fact metal operas](http://imgur.com/a/2tgwW#12).  Expecting that to be a sync issue or something, I close and restart the app.  Still says rock.  So I go to edit the data because that will bother my OCD, while in the zune software it's just [right click -&gt; edit](http://imgur.com/a/2tgwW#9) which brings up a lovely little [full-featured](http://imgur.com/a/2tgwW#10) metadata editing area.  Now, you have to go through [this clusterfuck](http://imgur.com/a/2tgwW#16) which has artists on ""now playing"" that certainly are not and are not even artists I would like if you looked at my library.  Where did they come from?  


Now, getting this far was [this easy](http://imgur.com/a/2tgwW#7) in the Zune software.


Anyway, and Zune behaves similarly, but in Zune I just click a list icon and a list comes up that does not obscure the visualization, where in [XBM](http://imgur.com/a/2tgwW#15) a large, overly padded list comes up.  


Why Microsoft, a piece of shit nearly unusable thing?  Why couldn't you just tweak Zune a bit or add a switch to flip between desktop and touch UIs?  Oh well, guess no metro music application for me.

By now, user account synchronisation (which is awesome, by the way), and several performance improvement.

What about tiny

One example from me: Up to Windows 7, it went into standby mode, and continued shutting down when I woke it up again. Windows 8 seems to ignore everything once the shutdown process has started, which means that when I leave at work, I press the power button, close the laptop, and when I am done packing, and I can just grab the bag and leave

**Tons of new features!**

In this update

* **You can now view comments in Preview Mode!** The full array of commenting features (like changing sorting) are still only available on the dedicated Article Page
* **I handle more reddit.com links internally!** This means that when you click on a post in r/bestof, links in comments that point to reddit.com), but that'll be addressed later.
* **You can change the color scheme!** Don't like the various blues that I use? Change them!
* **User pages!** You can now view your own user page in the Accounts dropdown
* **Quick actions!** I've made it easier to do common actions like upvote, I'll show a couple links for those sorts of actions, making them one click away. For touch, I've added options to customize the swipe-select and double-tap behavior, so you can, for instance, make the app bar appear on left-swipe
* **The app remember links you've visited!** I'll gray out the title of stories once you've visited them. I also added an appbar command to un-visit a link if you don't want to forget to look at it later. History should roam between computers
* **Performance increases!**. The app performs a lot better on devices like the Surface.
* **Load more comments!** As you scroll
* **Fixed the blank-screen-on-launch bug!** I had a terrible bug involving the Store's ""app was installed!"" toast that would put my app in a bad state where it only showed a blank page. I finally tracked down the issue and fixed it. PM me if you're interested in the technical side =)

And this is just a partial list! The full list can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit_to_go/comments/11si5c/change_log/). 

I encourage you all to download it and try it out! Leave feedback if you want anything added/changed. A lot of stuff in this version was the direct result of feedback I've received. And go Pro! if you love the app! No, and get in while the price is its cheapest.

Just wanted to share that once again

ReddHub v 5.7 is now approved and will be live in the store soon. If you have any comments or feedback

Some new features -


**Subreddit pane UX tweaks and 'shortcuts' feature**

The subreddit pane has now been [cleaned up a bit](http://i.imgur.com/CDEz1WA.png) to support the shortcuts feature. The new shortcuts feature looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/af7OQ8j.png), such as apple and Microsoft into a 'technology' subreddit. Shortcuts will be at the top of your list.

**Instapaper support added to reduce crashing and speed up page loads

A pain point of the app has always been slow performance/crashing caused by loading webpages in the the Windows 8 webview. We cant fix the webview, which will load a trimmed down fast version of the page. This is enabled/disabled by the 'simple' checkbox at the bottom of a page. Take a look [here to see it in action](http://i.imgur.com/HNsZt5a.png)

**Messages cleanup and context**

As you may know

**Full Features List**

* added subreddit shortcuts! - You can now combine subreddits and add to your list without logging in or subscribing
* Reduced crashing - Added a 'simplified' option for loading webpages with instapaper for improved perf/readability
* Fixed context links to show where link came from
* Added caching to the comment panel incase you switch away
* Added padding to paragraphs for improved readability
* Performance improvements by upgrading various libraries
* Added comments link for share
* Added a more-&gt;close option to close an opened link

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed bug where switching between albums fast would sometimes destabilize app
* Fixed bug where progress bar would not start correctly when navigating within a page
* Fixed bug where a specific comment highlighting color was off
* Prettied up messages panel
* Lots of UI tweaks

First off, I recommend it over windows 7, but I have 3 monitors in my battlestation and the new Start Screen and Metro Apps are inherently incompatible with this setup.

1. The first issue, except that THIS INCLUDES THE START SCREEN!!!! WTF?! I like to use the Netflix metro app on my right screen while working, but whenever I press the windows button or otherwise navigate to the start screen, it must always stop my netflix app and use that screen. Is there a work around for this? As it stands, I can't even use a single metro app because it gets interrupted when accessing the start screen.

2. There doesn't seem to be a reliable way to make a single screen the one that gets used for the start screen. Why can't the start screen open on whichever monitor I currently have my mouse on? Instead, I usually have Netflix open on my right-monitor. These features clash, and I often have programs opening behind the ""start-screen"" or other metro apps. I'll try to open a pdf file from my mail app, and it opens behind the mail app and it appears to me that nothing has happened at all.

In conclusion, which makes me lose the ability to search, change settings, open new applications, etc.

1361206623.0,18raxk,"Microsoft, Windows, and the (lack of?) proper terminology.",Edg-R,27,13

I'm aware that Microsoft's lack of universal terminology as well as UIs for their own software/hardware are nothing new. One of the most apparent problems lately

Lets say person A has a Microsoft Surface RT ([Previously known as Microsoft Surface with Windows RT](http://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-changes-names-of-surface-tablets-on-website)) and is able to download apps from the Windows Store. 

Now lets say that person B has a desktop with Windows 8

I've seen quite a few people and websites using the term ""app"" interchangeably. For example

Now what exactly does that mean? *If they're Windows 8 apps

Apparently it was the latter

So my question is... Can we decide on a proper term to use? Such as:

* Application
* App

Or

* Windows application
* Windows Store app

Or 

* Desktop app
* Modern app

Now keep in mind

Would you call Microsoft Office 2013 an app? How about Adobe Creative Suite or Autodesk's AutoCAD? It seems weird called them apps doesn it? 

In my mind

Take Office OneNote for example.

* Microsoft Office OneNote 2013 would probably be seen as an application
* Microsoft OneNote MX (From the Windows Store) would probably be seen as an app

Anyways

EDIT: 

From the Oxford dictionary:

&gt;**App**
&gt;
&gt;Pronunciation: /ap/
&gt;
&gt;noun
&gt;
&gt;Computing
&gt;
&gt;a self-contained program or piece of software designed to fulfil a particular purpose; an application

I found that the best way to solve this is to do the following:

**Go to Settings (move mouse to the upper right corner) &gt; Change PC Settings &gt; User &gt; Switch to local account  
Log off and on to the local account.  
Go to the same setting and ""Switch to live account""


If you just make a new account without using the switch function you will not get your settings transferred with you.

This just came into my spam folder and I must say it's a very unique piece of junk mail.  It's not my usual junk pills or money from some rich person in Africa

*********************************
Windows 8 is a lousy Operating System. Its supposed improved performance and claims of improved battery life are exaggerrated, because they switched the interface around so that you have new computer skills to learn. It doesn't really matter whether you want to buy it anyway, because sooner or later it will probably be forced on you by hardware manufacturers.

Windows 8 is a shameless marketing ploy, because ""Christmas"" is a big lie.

Excerpts from **URL Removed for safety's sake**

""Xmas has absolutely nothing to do with God. It was originally called Yuletide, it made them lots of money.""

""SANTA CLAUS is an anagram for SATAN.""

""The fact that the three kings came to pay homage, to those who perverted the teaching, the idea to continue and even increase the sales of their merchandise (a great marketing-exercise for them). So the virgin-birth was hijacked and corrupted into a time to make lots of money, using the ultimate in ""high-pressure sales techniques"", which was to falsely use God's Son's name, in order to embarass people, who couldn't afford to buy gifts, driving them further into debt and poverty or crime

Do you want to give more of your hard-earned money to an opulent mega-corporation? Do you want to serve satan? Don't fall for the cheap con-artist tricks of the Windows peddlers.

And yes it is difficult to adjust to initially (took me 40 minutes). I have and heard nothing but alarmist warnings that it is going to ostracize their current audience and no one is going to upgrade.

The tech writers like to focus on small issues that in the greater scheme of things really aren’t a problem. No start button!! Well… not really true

Windows 7 already had touch! Yes it did

I don’t want touch! Yes. Yes you do. If you have ever used an iPad, being able to use a mice is great.

It also has Kinnect support

I think some tech writers are caught in a features game where by it's all about better hardware and marginally more functional software. Microsoft have gone back to the drawing board and thrown out the traditional rules that have us cemented in a certain way of doing things not because it is the best way but because it is the most familiar. And much like they did with the hugely under rated Windows Phone 7

It’s not good enough to keep doing things the same way because that’s the way we do it. Windows XP &amp; 7 are fantastic operating systems but it’s no longer good enough to keep churning out things that are mildly better

&gt;*Uninstalling Windows Store is not supported. However

**Method 1:**

Refer to the link and try to install the update rollup for Windows 8:
Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 update rollup: May 2013
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2836988

**Method 2:**

You may try to reset the Store cache and note down if you get any error message:

*a.     Swipe in from the right edge of the screen

(If you're using a mouse, and then click Search.)

*b.    Enter “Run” without quotes in the search box

*c.     Type “WSReset.exe” without quotes and press Enter.

*d.    Now test the issue.

**Method 3:**

I would suggest you to create a new user account and check if the issue persists.

I skipped Method 1 because I already have the update installed. I did Method 2 and I was able to Access the Store App but there's still no App shortcut to Pin to the Metro Start Menu

""We don't need full-screen apps!

I can distinctly remember people having issues with apps with a lot of ""chrome"" on them. (""Chrome, such as name bars, toolbars, etc. It does *not* refer to Google Chrome in any way; in fact, it's quite ironic that Google Chrome started the revolution in chrome-less web browsing.) Hence the movement among many web browsers to lessen the chrome and give their more screen real estate.

Then Windows 8 with its full-screen apps comes along, the same one they demanded from web browsers. What's with all the hypocrisy?

I'll tell you why Windows 8 chose to have full-screen apps: **more functionality, and forces developers to be more creative in their app design without using chrome.

1. Disable fast start-up
2. Select advanced start up under 'general settings'

I have tried both of these options and neither has helped. Disabling fast start-up seems to have made no obvious change. When using advanced start-up

I have also tried:

- CMOS Reset (i get message to press F1 then a blank screen
- Remove windows 8 Drive and Reset CMOS (I get message to press F1 then a blank screen)
- Downgrading / upgrading BIOS (no change)

So even with my OS drive unplugged im unable to:

- Boot from DVD or USB
- Access the BIOS

Microsoft support has told me

Please offer help if you can... i'm loosing my mind.

please be aware that under the advanced startup options in windows 8

System config is below:

Before I dive into all the changes and features we've added I wanted to take a second to thank all the people that left feedback and helped us to find issues with the app. You've all been super supportive and helpful

Now for the changes...

- We've added fixes for all the most common crashes that people have encountered

- We gutted and re-wrote a TON of the code that interfaces with reddit and caches that information. As a result

- A lot of people love the homescreen, but that's only on first launch and it improves the experience on every subsequent launch.

- We got a ton of feedback around selftext not displaying properly

- The app now grays out content that you've already read so that you know what's new on your feeds. Next step

- You can now sort subreddit content by new

- In the appbar we've added the ability to favorite subreddits

- We've made changes to the pinned subreddit tiles so that the names of subreddits are more legible. 

- Share content from /r/etro to other applications (the old version could only share things TO /r/etro)

- Tons of other smaller fixes. Including small UX changes that nobody should explicitly notice (unless you REALLY look) but should make the app feel better.

To those of you that have already tried /r/etro, and will come with all the big features a whole number increment warrants. Some of the basic things we're adding are stuff like user pages, messaging, search, a light theme, etc. But we're most excited about a couple super cool features we're not ready to discuss yet.

It also doesn't let you really manage your library via metadata editing or putting in your own album art.

I've been using Play to on windows8 with the standard definition mp4 files and it works flawlessly. I started looking around and never found a way to convert MKV to MP4 without it being a huge pain in the ass. MKV and MP4 use the same x264 compression so you don't need to transcode in reality so it isn't as crazy as it seems to convert without loosing quality. The audio is the thing that needs conversion (AC3 or DTS to AAC) so this is really a lot less work than every video converter makes it. I found this guys page that describes how to do it. 

http://en.dogeno.us/2010/05/batch-convert-x264-encoded-mkv-video-files-into-mp4-files-for-playing-on-ipadiphoneipod-touchpsp-etc/

The download and batch files are incomplete as far as the options for the input audio format and framerate. This seems really complicated but it isn't because I will post the batch files I updated for DTS and AC3. Just edit the batch file and paste in the following and save as a different name to keep track of which audio type. Here is the batch file for AC3 audio:


@ ECHO OFF

REM convert mkv file into mp4 (option

IF EXIST *.mkv FOR %%A IN (*.mkv) DO CALL :mkvConvert ""%%A""

:mkvConvert

mkv2mp4\mkvextract.exe tracks %* 1:output.h264 2:output.ac3 3:output.sub

mkv2mp4\ffmpeg.exe -i output.ac3 -acodec libfaac output.aac

mkv2mp4\MP4Box.exe -add output.h264:fps=23.976 -add output.aac -add output.sub -new %*.mp4

DEL output.h264

DEL output.aac

DEL output.ac3

DEL output.sub

ECHO.

GOTO :EOF


Here is the Batch file for DTS:


@ ECHO OFF

REM convert mkv file into mp4 (option

IF EXIST *.mkv FOR %%A IN (*.mkv) DO CALL :mkvConvert ""%%A""

:mkvConvert

mkv2mp4\mkvextract.exe tracks %* 1:output.h264 2:output.dts 3:output.sub

mkv2mp4\ffmpeg.exe -i output.dts -acodec libfaac output.aac

mkv2mp4\MP4Box.exe -add output.h264:fps=23.976 -add output.aac -add output.sub -new %*.mp4

DEL output.h264

DEL output.aac

DEL output.dts

DEL output.sub

ECHO.

GOTO :EOF


Now he talks about how to check the audio format on the mkv you want to convert. I recommend using mkvetractgui because it is the gui version of the tool not the command line interface and you can see all the relevant info.

I elected not to use TrueCrypt on it because the TC developers recommend you not doing so and I hear you take a pretty big performance hit and TRIM/wear leveling functionality is pretty questionable.

Windows 8 seems to have taken into account the increasing popularity of SSDs. I have a Samsung 830 and used the Magician software it comes with to optimize the drive. One of the OS optimization things it recommends is to disable defrag. When checking out my HDDs I discovered that Windows 8 doesn't defrag the SSD but will optimize it and do some kind of trim function.

Since Bitlocker is offered

So has anyone implemented bitlocker on their OS drive on an SSD and what kind of performance hits did you see. I know that sandforce controllers don't work well with encryption as they can't compress on the fly but Samsung performs at the same level regardless. 

I think that the performance hit shouldn't affect me. I am using an older Core 2 Duo laptop without hardware AES. Sony's bios lock prevents me from enabling AHCI and my computer only supports SATA1 and looking at my transfer rates

I would love to hear anyones experience with this. Encryption doesn't seem to be a high priority with most people and most of my google search results are for Windows 7 or for regular SSDs.

Before anyone recommend I just use Truecrypt

My concern is not corporate espionage or having drives full of kiddie porn because I have nothing of the sort so I don't really need a twofish-aes combo encryption with file keys. I just realize if someone where to rob my place,False,self,t5_2s692,False,,,t3_12g1zf

 *  Native ISO mounting - Finally!
 *  Excellent Multi-monitor support - multi picture backgrounds &amp; themes are very nice.
 *  Boot in 7 seconds - after bios
 *  App store - like it or not
 *  New file explorer - New ribbon interface is more efficient than old school menus.

Con

 *  Multi monitor support for Metro Apps - Metro Apps only lives on one monitor.

Ok, it is very difficult to read. Here's the workaround:


Here's how I got it to work (tested on an has worked for 3 apps so far): 


1. In your package.appmanifest, if any). 


2. Then


3. For 'publisher common name'


4. Then create an app package


5. Then
(If your are doing this for multiple apps


6. Copy the correct package name (given in the error). 


7. Go back to your package.appmanifest


8. Now that the manifest is correct, and upload that package to the store. 


9. That's it!

I haven't done anything extraordinary, it was either MacBook Pro or MacBook Air.

I chose this hardware/software solution as it suits my needs well. I wanted a computer to primarily consolidate/hold and share an iTunes library

Many of the applications I recommend below are available for OSX and Windows however I just can't live without Windows Explorer for file management. This is my first experience with Windows 8


Please comment with any further questions.



In this brief guide I will discuss the following in order:

* operating system
* hardware
* screenshots
* applications/utilities/drivers
* setting default applications in Windows 8
* The Sims 3
* desktop shortcuts
* keyboard shortcuts
* Enable show desktop



**operating system**

A retail DVD* copy of Windows 8 Pro 64-Bit described as ""WINDOWS 8 PRO ENG INTL FOR OEM SOFTWARE""
*call me useless but I used a Apple USB SuperDrive during installation rather than a USB bootable ISO - The are many guides online as to how to achieve this installation without an optical drive.

I also activated* an official free copy of Windows Media Center available here (for a limited time): http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-8/feature-packs

*note: If you have trouble activating Windows online from the Metro UI use the Activate mode from the Desktop Control Panel. There is a bug with internet connectivity if not established during the initial Windows 8 installation.

**setting default applications in Windows 8 (i.e. VLC Media Player and Chrome)**

Windows 8 trys to maintain file associations with some of it's metro apps



**--for the kids/The Sims 3 (EA Origin digital edition)**

Compatibility has been getting a bit of attention online so I'll throw it in here:
Install/Update Origin
Play



**desktop shortcuts**

I personally needed to slowly migrate myself away from the natural Start button reaction to I created a few desktop shortcuts for some common Start button requests. I placed these in the lower left corner of my desktop.

* ""Start"" desktop folder to hold application shortcuts
* Windows Explorer shortcut	target: ""C:\Windows\explorer.exe""
* Control Panel shortcut	(Drag Control folder from Windows Explorer onto the desktop to create this shortcut)
* Run shortcut	target: ""%windir%\explorer.exe shell:::{2559a1f3-21d7-11d4-bdaf-00c04f60b9f0}""
* Command Prompt shortcut	target: ""C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe""



**keyboard shortcuts**

The key to managing the Windows 8 UI and mitigating the absence of the Start button on the taskbar is keyboard shortcuts
For complete set of Windows 8 keyboard shortcuts visit: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-8/keyboard-shortcuts

**Windows logo key (or Apple command key)** 			Display or hide the Start screen
Hitting the Windows key on its own brings up the Metro desktop. However, files and settings. You can also switch to searching other Metro apps from within the interface. You can navigate the results with the arrow keys and Enter, so you don’t need to use a mouse at all.
													
**Windows logo key (or Apple command key) +C**		Open the charms
Think of charms as a kind of super-sized options setting: you can use individual charms to share with other apps, or send something to a connected device such as a printer or drive.
													
**Windows logo key (or Apple command key) +D**		Display and hide the desktop
If you’re not using Metro apps and want a more familiar Windows interface
													
**Windows logo key (or Apple command key) +R**		Open the Run dialog box
Opens Run menu where you can launch programs by typing in their executable file names.
													
**Windows logo key (or Apple command key) +F**		Open the Search charm and search for files
													
**Windows logo key (or Apple command key) +I**		Open the Settings charm
This is a speedy route to system-wide PC settings. It’s also where you’ll find the Power button if you want to shut down your machine entirely (by default
													
**Windows logo key (or Apple command key) +Tab**		Cycle through open apps (except desktop apps)



**Enable show desktop (Peek)**

Aero Peek featured is disabled by default in Windows 8. Right-click on the taskbar and then click Properties to open Taskbar Properties. Under Taskbar tab

Games affected: Fallout 3 GOTY, Battlefield 3, XCOM:EU, Diablo III, etc. (Pretty much everything)

AMD FX-4100

ASRock 970 Extreme 4 BIOS 2.20

I've tried updating my Catalyst drivers (doing a driver sweep in between each change) and that hasn't helped at all. I'd rather not reformat and reinstall 7 right now

Anyone have any similar experiences?

In my opinion

With that said, weaker and with a smaller screen than a laptop/desktop), but I feel like they're worth it if it allows me to have only one device to carry/worry about.

I'm not planning on using it for heavy gaming, etc). Spec-wise, all I need is an Ultrabook. Intel Ivy Bridge Core i5, 4GM RAM, Intel HD Graphics 4000 and 128 GB SSD. The device also needs docking options, because I will use it with 2 external displays, an external keyboard and an external mouse. However

Here is a list of some Windows 8 hybrid/convertible ""Ultrabook"" devices I found:

- [Microsoft Surface Pro](http://www.microsoft.com/Surface/en-US/surface-with-windows-8-pro/home)

However, there was the problem of integrating Xbox Music with my Zune collection.  I have used Zune for years and am a current subscriber to the Zunepass, so I have a decent collection built up.  At first, it took me a while to figure out how to get my Xbox Music to import the Zune pass songs from Zune.  Got that taken care of, then went to play some music and it gave me a DRM error message.  The thing is, it only gives me that message for some songs.  Even other songs on the same album will play.  Eventually I gave up on that and just went back to using Zune.

Then, did not ever actually download or install.  I tried to cancel the installation; the operation hung and it just sat there without changing.  I closed the store by dragging it down to the bottom of the screen, re-opened it, and it was still doing the same thing.  Eventually, about 15 minutes later, I was able to cancel the installation.  Like I said, small things distracting me from being productive.

Also, I could not figure out what it was downloading.  It just would not tell me and I couldn't find anything to manage downloads.  Is there anything like a download center to see my downloads and manage them?

I tried creating a custom resolution under the Nvidia control panel but that only made it look worse. I tried doing a system restore to the earliest possible date and still no option to select the correct resolution. I also double checked to see if the drivers were up to date on both my video card and monitor

Recently, it didn't and trying to figure out that kind of advanced issue on an operating system I barely know, was just too much for me. So last night, I re-installed Windows 8 again, this time 64-bit, since I found out my CPU on that machine, is a x64-based processor and now I'm going to try and see if I can fix this issue in Windows. It was also a clean install of Win8 since I had to reformat the hard drive due to Ubuntu formatting the HD to FAT32. I also went into the BIOS to look for any resolution related things that may have been changed and couldn't find anything

My system specs are:

Windows 8 Pro

CPU: AMD Athlon 64 Proccesor 3800+ 2.40 GHz

RAM: 3GB

Video Card: NVIDIA GeForce 9600 GT

Monitor: [Acer AL1716W](http://panam.acer.com/acerpanam/monitor/0000/Acer/AL1716/AL1716sp3.shtml)

We're doing some investigation of a Windows 8 rollout using SCCM 2012 SP1. We can do ""deep-linking"" - installing apps directly from the Windows Store - but it requires user input so it isn't really ideal.  A better alternative for us would be to deploy AppX files directly

I started noticing my fans kick up to max speed every five or so minutes when my computer was idle, every five minutes my CPU load would go from 1-2% to 80-100%, and my temperatures would shoot up, followed by an increase in fan speed. The culprit, according to the Task Manager? Windows Defender. Starting Windows Defender showed that the last Quick Scan was at the same time the load and temps shot up. I've tested it several times now, and sure enough, it happens every five minutes when my computer is idle.

I've always been a big fan of MSE, as it has effectively replaced MSE. Windows Defender, however, does not have many of the settings that MSE had, namely, the ability to schedule Quick Scans.

Honestly, as someone with control issues, it bothers me that Windows Defender feels the need to Quick Scan every five minutes. Am I the only person experiencing this? Is there any known solution?

1347049658.0,ziugq,Windows 8: My Take,jayhawk88,12,4,44,"So I finally took the plunge and installed Windows 8 on my main desktop at work. I'm not the kind of person that can install an OS on a VM and get a decent opinion just from working on that; inevitably I don't do a whole lot in the VM and mostly forget about it. I have to dive into the deep end. Now, but it's mostly a game and surfing machine

A couple of thoughts right off the top:

- If you've been playing with Win8 on a VM or single monitor system

- There doesn't seem to be near the step up from 7 to 8, to just simple ""Run the install in Win7 Compatibility Mode"" (vSphere 5 console). The only thing I had deal-stopping issues with were a couple of obscure third-party programs that I need to support for local users, which is what VM's were made for.

- Speaking of virtualization...if you're interested in Hyper-V that comes with 8, but something to be aware of before you do a fresh install, if VM's are vital to your work.

**The Good: It's the little things**

There's a lot with Win8 that I honestly do really like. The new file copy thing is maybe a bit cheesy, I really like the new Task Manager. ""Oh, hello, Music App, I see you've used 10 meg of bandwidth in the past 3 days even though I've never used you once"". The Fewer Details mode is actually nice to for just parking on your dekstop somewhere for constant quick-view of your system, if that kind of thing is your bag. 

Also...RETURN OF THE UP FOLDER ARROW IN EXPLORER! It never should have been taken away from us. The new ribbon interface with Explorer....eh

Performance wise, while this isn't a Win8 thing per se, the new Remote Desktop Connection Manager you're forced to use (since the old one went away from RSAT) is nice, though I do miss being able to see all my logged in users on all my servers at once.

I still need to get into the finer details of GP and how well it plays with Win8, my security policies are applying, my drives are mapping, etc. 

**The Bad: It's the little things**

Those silly little context pop-ups that you get on the sides and corners are annoying as hell. I know they can be turned off in settings but still, little crap like having every icon created by an install show up on your Start Menu by default, forcing you to go clean all the worthless stuff up, which itself is annoying (right, navigate down to the Unpin from Start button...can't just use the Delete key, oh no). Not being able to rename items that get plunked down on your Start Menu, at least via the Start Menu interface. Having to go find and pin icons that you probably use often, My Computer, that are buried in that ""All Apps"" option. Once you get your desktop setup the way you like

And let's be frank here: Desktop is still really important. Some things, Music, etc apps, seem to do that ""run full screen"" thing that doesn't throw you back to the Desktop, but most other apps don't, including IE weirdly enough (but Chrome does?). Office 2010 apps don't do this either. You're still going to be using the desktop a bunch, which makes the new Start Menu decision by Microsoft even more bizarre. I'd understand it if everything ran like an iOS app or something, at least on a desktop computer. 

Really, and I'm sorry, but there's just no getting around it: The new Start Menu makes your computing experience more difficult. Yes, you use it for a bit and you get used to it, but I shouldn't have to ""get used"" to fundamental things about my operating system, just because they were changed for dubious reasons. Don't try to tell me this is a fundamental shift in UI theory or it was impossible to include an old start menu for coding reasons or whatever. You can pin whatever you like to the taskbar in the Desktop, why not be able to pin the Start Menu, or defaulting back to the old way

The new Start Menu breaks my workflow; instead of just being able to click something on the screen, lest you be buried in a mountain of icons that are now significantly bigger, yet literally everything a program wants to install is just thrown on there with no attempt at organization, leaving that as a task you have to do. It's almost like there's a fight going on here between the Start Menu and the Desktop people at Microsoft. Clearly MS thinks that you shouldn't be relying on your Desktop as much, which is why it's more difficult to put program icons on it, why the new Start Menu is full screened and can run some stuff without even going to the Desktop...but only a handful of apps (including Microsoft's own) can pull off the no-desktop trick, you're going to find yourself pinning even more stuff than normal to your taskbar to have it within easy reach (encouraging desktop use; I barely use the Start Menu now).

Maybe I'm just being a curmudgeon and stubbornly holding on to ""how it used to be"", I'd basically have Win7 with a few tweaks, but perhaps that's the point. Start Menu aside, it doesn't really seem like there's a lot new here, certainly not enough to justify a new/upgrade OS purchase/install. I'm going to keep Win8 on my main for now, because it's there and I'm still checking it out, but if my hard drive melts down tomorrow and I have to reinstall again,,False,t3_ziugq

Windows 8 just like Windows 7 with some weird ""now-not-even-Metro"" thing...

But it's not! It's whole new system, and even more productive than Windows 7.
