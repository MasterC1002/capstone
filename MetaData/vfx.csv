I think an FAQ would be a great addition to this subreddit. Every so often we get people asking beginner questions.

Some questions that I think should be on the FAQ:

_______________________________________________________________________
***Which software is the best?***

There is no ""best"" software. These are tools that can only be as good as you are. Also

That said

**3D Software:**

Maya (Mostly for Film &amp; Animation. Has the steepest learning curve

3DS Max (Mostly Video Games &amp; Architecture &amp; TV.)

Cinema4D (Mostly Motion Graphics and TV)

XSI SoftImage (Mostly Film &amp; Animation. Its popularity is growing)


**FX/Simulation:**

Houdini is great for specialized effects and simulation. Chances are if you see digital fire in a film, cloth, and water simulation are also possible. If you want to further experiment with fluids/water, you can add RealFlow to Houdini, Maya and some other software.


**Sculpting/Detailing:**

Zbrush is the most widely used sculpting software. Mudbox


**Texturing/Matte painting:**

Photoshop is the most popular, try GIMP instead of Photoshop.


**Compositing:**

If you want to composite, but it's better for motion graphics.


**Tracking/Matchmoving:**

For 3D tracking and matchmoving

_______________________________________________________________________

***Where do I go to learn this stuff?*** 
Assuming you aren't taking any college classes on this or would like to learn more there are many resources for you online. [FXPHD](http://www.fxphd.com/), [Video Copilot](http://www.videocopilot.net/), [Greyscalegorilla](http://greyscalegorilla.com/blog/), [Video2Brain](http://www.video2brain.com/en/redirected.htm), [Lynda](http://www.lynda.com/, [TutsPlus](https://tutsplus.com/), [MattTrunks](http://www.mattrunks.com/en), [cgsociety/cgtalk](http://forums.cgsociety.org/)

**The most important thing to remember when looking at tutorials:**

Copying tutorials once and moving on doesn't teach you anything. Once you're done with a tutorial

_____________________________________________________________________

***What does an Effects Artist do and how do I become one?*** 
Effects artists do a lot of things really, dent things, create elements that interact with characters. We create snow, dust hits, debris, and pretty much anything that was missing during the shot that isn't a character. We are often responsible for the elements/weather as well(Oceans, clouds, lightning, or create the heads up display for a futuristic headset.

9 times out of 10

How do you become one? That is a toughie. You have to be incredibly self driven, vector math, and calculus doesn't hurt. A good helping of scripting is also incredibly useful. You need to have an eye for timing, composition, and emotion as well. Learning Houdini is a must. Even if your studio doesn't use it, many of the alternatives are procedural node based systems and Houdini is arguably the best at implementing these 3d node systems. Depending on the project and the studio, you will probably need a basic understanding of lighting because it is more than likely you will be responsible for lighting your own effects. A working knowledge of shaders is also recommended. There are a lot of premade things out there

Also

_______________________________________________________________________

***What does a Compositor do and how do I become one?*** 
A compositor's job is to make the final image look as though it were all shot at the same time, to shots with hundreds of CG creatures or buildings that all need to look like they existed in one place at one time.

A compositor mostly works in a 2D world - dealing with flat images, random CG elements from the renderer, or stills from a library. It is the digital equivalent of making a collage of cut out photographs. A compositor should understand what goes on inside a camera, as a lot of what ties a shot together are the imperfections that a lens and camera create in a shot. Things like grain, chromatic aberration and lens distortion are all imperfections that don't come with raw CG, but need to be added to ensure that the whole shot fits together. Even on a 100% fully CG shot, it will often be rendered as separate elements, and that all of these imperfections are added to stop the shot from looking out of place in context with the non-CGI shots. One should also have a very good eye for colour
These days

To become a compositor, plus [fxphd](http://www.fxphd.com) has some well-regarded Nuke training.

The career path for a compositor often starts out with rotoscoping. This is an entry-level job where the task is to generate mattes for elements that weren't shot on green (or blue) screen. Often, an aspiring compositor would then move onto what is known as ""prep"". This is usually anything that requires removing something from a shot, whether it is wires from a stunt or tracking markers that had been places for the matchmovers, it'll be the job of the Prep team to remove them and pass on the results to the compositors. After doing Roto and Prep (often part of the same department - Roto/Prep), the next stage is as a Junior Compositor. At this stage, it's purely a matter of experience and ability to progress to Compositor and then Senior Compositor. After that, one might take on more of a leadership role, Sequence Lead

As a compositor, and an understanding of photography.

***I want to build/upgrade my computer for VFX related work
If you're just starting out, then drop the money. 

This is just a basic outline on what to look for. 

*CPU (Processors)*: i7 Intel processors are currently the best bang for your buck and work the fastest with your software. If you have the budget, they do not run as fast as Intel when using most of these applications. 

*RAM*: 16 GB of RAM is recommended to start with. If you have the budget, so don't kill yourself for it). 

*GPU (Graphics Card)*: Nvidia GeForce cards anywhere from 460 to 680 will do just fine. If you have the money

*Harddrives*: It is highly recommended that you get yourself a SSD (Solid State Drive) and install your OS and software on it. Then keep your storage and projects on a separate internal or external hard drive. It is extremely recommended you have a separate external hard drive to frequently back things up. Just remember it's a computer and shit happens. Back up your shit. *Do you hear that?* **BACK UP YOUR SHIT.**

I just came out of a program that taught me Maya and After Effects. It was a general program but it gave me enough sample experience with different work that I came to learn where I like to be on a project and where I feel comfortable and capable of expanding.  
  
But I know this is a personal stance
  
So I pose the question, case studies would tie it together for you. Is it about making a wide array of flashy blockbuster effects, or making small things that can't be noticed as amiss in a scene. Is it the composition and delicate balance in creating a scene or cramming in as much eye candy as possible.  
  
Is it about the tools
  
If someone came at you and said ""Man
  
Would you encourage a Nuke/Mari/Ocula/Maya workflow or approach with After Effects
  
I'm kind of curious if we can't create a collection of materials for this craft. VFX still reads from the outside as some whimsical profession that involves sleepless weeks and a crap-ton of people and accomplishes a relatively showy amount of product in turn.  
  
I had a friend that was surprised to learn more than one company worked on vfx for films like Harry Potter or Avengers and wondered ""what vfx really does anyways""  
  
I know there's articles for the people who already understand it
  
So I guess, the ""random"" clickers of reddit, the stumbler's of the web. Can we not put something that would give to people a ""What, Why, Where, How"" of the field. A cumulative ""beginners guide"" to vfx if you would.  ",,self,,

I did lots and lots of low/no pay jobs when starting out, and succeeded quite well in gathering almost every other department to work with me: actors, musicians, writers, camera operators, editors, you name it -- we were all hungry for work and wanted to make something reel-worthy.  I never had such luck with my fellow visual effects peers.  They never seemed interested.  I eventually got the impression VFX must be so ""in demand"" that they simply didn't need to do these projects... they were somehow above it.

From what I've gathered true repeatable multi-axis moco just plain isn't a cheap thing to do and nearly impossible to DIY without some fair electrical and mechanical engineering skill

Now, and Maya on hand so I wanted those three elements to be the basis of my system. Simple googling led me to other DIY projects that utilized those elements, notably for the dolly design and Arduino/Maya interfacing, so my system is essentially a combination of the two.

**Dolly and Slider**

There are numerous motorized dollies and slider designs that people have built posted all over the web
Just replace the servo driver with an Arduino and the battery pack with a usb cable extender in the parts list.

For the slider I slapped together some window screen framing

**Arduino and Maya**

In 2009 Dan Thompson released [Servo Tools for Maya](http://danthompsonsblog.blogspot.com/search/label/Servo%20Tools%20For%20Maya) a set of Arduino, Maya, and Python can get it setup in an afternoon.

I also wrote a [python script](https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B9nXRkJ53q-hUG1ibkQ3TzNMVHM/edit) that’s designed to work with Servo Tools that adds convenient key frame flipping/mirroring for return moves and audible cueing functionality to assist in the shooting process. It’s not essential to get the system running

**Shooting**

Now since I went with a cheap continuous servo as my motor there is no positional encoding and thus a fair amount of drift and stuttering motion from internal gear slippage. This is unavoidable at this price point. There are however measures you can take to minimize drift such as easing in and out of your camera moves, and taking out as much backlash from the motor to the dolly wheel as you can. I got my drift down to +/- ¼ inch on a 34 inch move after some trial and error. Also it’s tethered so you’ll have to hold the cabling during the move to avoid drag.

**Post** 

Once you’ve shot your passes and imported the footage into a compositor use a difference blend mode to help with alignment. If you’ve got access to Furnace Core’s align node in Nuke, but that’s what you get for $150.

Ok

A little history:

I'm producing a video game based short film around a popular video game franchise. I conceptualized this back in 2004, and some of our images were even on the front page of reddit for a bit. Needless to say, because we received huge press on many of the popular gaming websites, it helped us slowly collect a group of exceptionally talented people.

So that's where we are now. So now that you know a little history, of locking down any sort of quality VFX, 3D work, or any post production that is not just basic editing work. I can't even begin to grasp what it takes to do VFX, and I know it's very tough work, but I don't understand why this specifically has been such an arduous thing to accomplish.

What we are trying to do is exceptionally ambitious, which we have) is just impossible to find, and those that we have found have always promised the world,  and then completely flaked out.

At this point, or is there something I'm doing that I'm not noticing?  We are paying, and when this is complete it will be the reel piece of a lifetime for many a geeky VFX artist.  

Thanks!

TL;DR finding good VFX and CGI artists that will not flake out after promising the world is the bane of my existence. Advice on how to overcome this is loved!

I'm currently in Toronto and looking for work as a compositor, DMM, RBD, SBD and Particles in Maya... But in no way have I found a time to get my hands on a decent camera and go shoot pieces. Or to create anything completely in CG.  
  
So this is what I'm wondering
  
I don't know what to do. I am supposed to do an internship by working at a company as an 'assistant' or something. But no one has replied and most anywhere I find in the area is calling for Nuke
  
It's likely a lot of fear and just anxiety at the idea that I'm just no good
  
I'm sorry to be asking this but just any help or projects you need help with in AE... let me know.  
  
Help me r/vfx... you're my only hope.


**edit for clarity**: I began learning after effects 6 years ago. The program I just took (postsecondary film program) has been going for 3 years and pushing after effects. Now I'm near graduation and am taking in that what I've been taught is largely irrelevant. I will be learning Nuke by the PLE and downloaded the Manual and resources also whatever Lynda.com can offer. At 36k in debt I can't afford to not use solely free resources and common sense. It's how I've learnt most things thus far, the only way to go.  
  
I do enjoy writing Python so I'll be aiming for that. My only experience with nodal anything is Houdini. I've 'played' with just about every software
  
Prior to coming here I was writing Java in a Comp Sci program and doing network IT/management... So the tech part is easy

I'm an FX student at Vanarts, reluctantly, with Houdini). The schools like to hype up the idea of getting a job directly after school, but from what I understand, for those as 'green' as I am, that's not exactly a realistic expectation. I know that the demo reel is the best focus, but I'm just curious as to opportunities within the community.

SO.

-What are the odds of finding independent work here

-What are some need-to-know dirties/positives about the local studios?

-As mentioned before, but I enjoy Maya far more. Any insight into the alleged popular migration towards Houdini?

And finally

-Are there studios that focus on this? 

-&amp;I've heard of programs/functions that allow an easier sync between the FX and music. Enlighten me!

Here are the results from my [1st attempt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/108820097/Sequence-H.264.mov). The track wasn't perfect and slipped quite a bit. This forced me to manually clean up some edges when my clean plate didn't quite line up properly. Other times I would get strange issues where the remove tool would properly replace the logo from the clean plate but the color would be way off. It appeared it was getting spill by sampling colors from foreground objects and assuming the illumination was changing drastically and trying to accommodate for it.

So

Several months later after becoming much more experienced with Mocha I tried it again. Here is my [2nd attempt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/108820097/Sequence2-H.264.mov) with a rock solid track and better roto shapes on the foreground elements which seemed to eliminate almost all of the illumination spill problems. However

So I still need to manually paint out a few frames. How can I do this so I don't get strange artifacts like in attempt 1? How did VFXs artists do this stuff in the past when we didn't have fancy remove tools liket this?

1. Do a simple 1-point track to maybe the door handle which would be applied to a solid large enough to cover up the entire car

2. Mask the general outline of the car on this solid

Just seeking out some advice on a shot my friend needs me to put in their production.

The idea is to create the rainbow effect that you acheive when you put pressure on a liquid crystal screen.  

The shot needs to be composed into a scene where the character experiences the phenomenom in reality.  So it needs to be motion tracked onto a surface with Mocha.

My idea so far is to use a colour gradient and mask it according to where the pressure appears to be applied.  I feel like the way you can manipulate the colour positions creates the effect well

I've googled around for learning materials and there are many out there. But a lot of the information is very fragmented or not available in a proper order. Since I'm new to this I don't have anyone to really guide me on where I should start or what order I should go about learning this vast topic. That is the reason why I came here for some advice. Maybe some of you will be kind enough to point me to some good learning material or advice me on topics I should be focusing on within renderman and ill try to go learn about them. I've also found there are some really good tutorials out there that are paid and right now unfortunately I do not have the resources to purchase them but in future I wish to. So for now I'll probably have to make do with the information that's freely available out there. But I just wanna make sure I make the best of it.

Just getting into VFX using an old HV20 and my smart camera and I'm noticing the problems with rolling shutter when applied to movematching. I've tried to solve the footage with After Effects 3D Camera Solver

Questions:

* Is this happening because of rolling shutter or because I'm a noob who doesn't have a clue?
* Do I need to get my hands on a 3CCD camera instead of the CMOS ones I'm using? Are they still making cheap ones?
* Should I give up on free-ish software solutions and get Syntheyes or PFMatchit or should the above software work fine if I have proper footage?

Thanks. Looking forward to some feedback.

For a long time now I've had a huge interest in the arts (drawing, music, etc.) but I have never really pursued it further than the occasional hobby (play some basic guitar, sketching during free time, etc.).  Once I graduated high school I focused on electrical engineering, which is the focus of my current employment (full time microchip designer) and school (trying to finish up my Ph.D. in the field).  

About 5/6 years ago I started learning more about VFX.  I started checking out what is actually part of the whole field.  I've learned things like rigging, but only in theory.  I've played around with some software, mainly like Adobe AE, but I am by no means anything to be considered ""viable"" for actually implementing anything that looks decent.  

My main focus now (outside of work and school) is to develop my ""soft"" skills, etc.

Anyways, I think compositing is what calls to me the most (assuming I am using the term correctly, in that this involves incorporating 2 or more shots/objects into one so they look seamless).  

Unfortunately, I keep considering just moving from this all and getting into VFX as a new career.  Just for more info, I'm 30+ and pretty much single (no major relationships that would be jeopardized by a sudden career change on my part).

PHew...that was a lot to say (and more than I've really told anyone).  My questions are really:

1)  Is there a chance for me to break into this field at all

2)  Is there some materials (mainly books) out there that are considered the ""tomes"" of the VFX world?  I'm not really looking for software specific books (I've had to learn a LOT of software in my life

3)  What fields are particularly in demand in the VFX area?

4)  What general advice, can you give?

Any advice is greatly appreciated!  Also note that I am a first time redditor,False,self,t5_2qhfw,False,,,t3_m6yxz
