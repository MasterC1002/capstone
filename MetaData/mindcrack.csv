1368910350.0,1elfjs,Why I Roleplay,generikb,2980,1113,544,"With today's recent posts about B-Team's roleplay-heavy videos, my background



disclaimer: This is about me



As a child, change sweaters and shoes...while singing ""It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood"".  He had the most calming, nicest voice imaginable.  And pretty much every episode he would talk to his friend Trolley (who was, as you can guess, a cable car trolley) who would then go through a little tunnel and into the land of Make Believe.



It was the most amazing thing ever when I was young.



My other childhood hero was/is my father.  He is a cowboy, and the greatest dad a kid could ever have.  He taught me how to be kind, loving, respectful...and gave me my sense of humor, patience, and self-worth.



I don't have kids myself.  My wife and I are 38 years old



But I like kids a lot, I knew that I wanted to be as kid friendly as possible and as entertaining to kids as possible.  



I wanted to be Mister Rogers: an inspiring, wholesome entertainer.  And I think on the whole I've stayed true to that goal.  Sure, there might be a swear word here and there during B-Team episodes...Call of Duty or Leisure Suit Larry for sure aren't meant for a 5 year old...but on the whole I'm pretty close to my goal.



Which brings us to the role playing...



Role playing isn't about being fake, dress up your character, and do practically anything you want.  And the kids *love* it, which going back to the beginning of this post is exactly my goal.



But I also recognize that I have ""adults"" who watch me as well.  You don't watch Mister Rogers

 

Some of you in the other thread were complaining that there's too many ""Wars"" going on...but if you really look at it



In Mine Wars, an automatic sissybar and charcoal maker (the last two thanks to designs from my fans).  



On FTB during Emerald Wars, and even went into detail of some lag inducing things we found that might help others with similar issues.




As a final thought



""I homeschool my kids



I am actually going to be doing something else this summer called ""On the Road with lil Genny"" - we are going on a couple long road trips and I will require him to take photos of a little stuffed GenerikB I made and create a photo journal with them



I'm a grown man



I don't do it for money



I don't do it to pander to kids (definition of pander is ""To cater to the lower tastes and desires of others or exploit their weaknesses"").  Mister Rogers didn't pander to me



And I'm not being fake or untrue to myself.  If you still think so after reading this



TL;DR - nope

I uploaded a video of a dating game called Katawa Shoujo, this is my first and only strike. Youtube work on a multiple strike system and yet after only one strike I find my entire account terminated without any chance to explain or fight it. I am distraught

Now I want to know why my accidental nudity causes the closure of my channel. While other Youtubers are free to expose nudity and much worse content without blow back. Does Youtube work on a double standard? It can choose to ignore its own guidelines so long as they are getting good money out of it. Will I receive any kind of apology from them?

Good exampe what I am talking about. In his last episode, etho is up there? And we are ""down there""? You cannot even build a derp tower anymore without somebody saying ""etho made that"". I am sick of it and it pisses me off as etho is my friend

I want to add to that. The same of course happens to me. Somebody sends me a nice design, you stole this design from doc..argh. So then, the idea behind trying to feature designs of others in the world tour makes no sense, if the people I try to feature or point out get accused of stealing. 

So many people play minecraft and only the combined brains/ideas of all these people make these crazy contraptions we love so  much in the game. One design is based on another, we are a group of friends on the server. We don't want to be pitted against eachother, or compete or battle. The youtube competition is tough, and within the group we try to stick together. 

I am in general pretty emotional and decide by my feelings. Maybe

It would be much apprecited, don't get mad as I maybe too often get, just tell them in a friendly way, that it is not important who did what first or when or how.

1367186398.0,1daobv,All You Need to Know to Get Into Mindcrack,Guardax,1137,186,200,"###Season 1
Season 1 was Guude's singleplayer world in the late Alpha stages of Minecraft. It ran from October-December 2010 and consisted of his Mindcrack 1-61. The episodes were daily and Guude never missed a day. It ended when SMP became actually survival

**Guude**

The boss. He started Mindcrack and built it up to where it is today. Yes, he knows he's near Episode 400. Has a secondary account called Easycgi that's been around since Season 1 but most prominently featured in Episode 200 and the Arena fixing. He dropped a bunch of gravel on a guy's house once and vined somebody else. Member of Nancy Drew, OOG, OOGE, and Ca$h Money. He *really* likes turtles. And his laugh is infectious.

###Season 2

This ran from Alpha 1.2.5 to Beta 1.7.3 (December 2010 to September 2011) and was the first Mindcrack season to have SMP. Original players were Guude's friends from World of Warcraft

**Thejims**

The man, but he's a good builder/technician and was the only person on the server not to make a LP until FTB started this year. He's a friend of Guude's from Warcraft and his skin is Alucard. Joined in December 2010.

**Jsano**

Joining New Year's 2011 Jsano was invited on the server because he was terrible at Minecraft. He is a firefighter and a nurse and lives in the D.C. area but is a native Michigander. He started the prank wars by hiding Guude's food

**Nebris**

Joining right after Jsano, and runs a dictator ship on FTB. North Nebris is best Nebris.

**Adlington**

He missed only one question on the first contest in a last-second submission and was added in February 2011. He was the third LPer on the server. He builds really big unfinished castles modeled after Harry Potter. Adlington has a Minion skin and used to live in the UK but has moved to Ottawa. He killed BdoubleO that one time and poured sand on his village. 

**Mhykol**

Yes we know who he is! Mhykol is a member of the server that joined in April 2011 for a one-off and joined fully in September that year. He likes building things and is a member of the Spawn. He is getting married soon. Mhykol also runs a really awesome server I play on /shameless plug. He currently has FTB server so you can expect frequent FTB videos from him.

**Vintage Beef**

First place in Contest 2 (make a video),000 this coming May. Beef is a builder and has built a mansion, a castle, and a jungle village. He has an eye for detail and getting frustrated at Villagers. His first death on Mindcrack was to fall damage hence 'done a Beef'. Now apparently he has no legs, his face got melted, and brown sheep are stalking him. Member of Nancy Drew and Team Canada. Has the definitive Prank Wars series.

**Baj**

Baj was third in Contest 2 and joined. He is known for his dry British humor and occasional swear words. Baj is another builder and spends a lot of his time building things. His content is pretty underwatched. In UHC 3 and 6 he was 'Baj Grylls'

**Shree**

The youngest member of the server coming in at 15, so stfu. Has an underwater house and does a mix of redstone and building. Currently on a hiatus from Mindcrack as he has exams.

###Season 3

The current Mindcrack season has been from September 2011 onwards to the present. Mindcrack has grown astronomically during this season

***BdoubleO***

Joined when Season 3 began after beginning the Legendary bromance with Guude in OOG. Guude's constant foil for a long time, seeing the Arena burn, and having huge 'E's placed above his build. His original still ongoing series is Building with BdoubleO where he does what he does best: build. Created the B-Team with Generik and does lots and lots of videos with him. It started as mafia hit squad against Etho culminating in the trial. And don't get me started on FTB. Bdubs is a key Mindcrack member. *Snaps fingers*.

**Pakratt**

Pakratt got second in Contest 3, as well as his epic rants. See 'Minecraft version 1.never' on his channel for more. He is currently hanging out in FTB, and started the push not to kill the Dragon there. Pakratt is a Cobblehater and a floating head.

**Arkas**

Third in contest 3

**Avidya**

Avidya was whitelisted when Season 3 began, Guude, and Vechs created Race for Wool and were part of the first RFW match. Avidya is 'the Dude', and drinks white Russians. He likes sandstone. Part of team Ca$h Money.

**Pause**

Pause is a Canadian Indian on the server. He is engaged to his girlfriend Andrea and lives in British Columbia. Pause shaved his head for Zeldathon charity. He joined in November 2011,000 subscribers. He is traditionally partnered with Beef and is part of Team Canada.

**MCGamer**

MC is the Nintendo LPer on the server. He has made *six* different LP series on the server. MC has built the Underwater Palace, a charity livestream. He is part of the Fun For Freedom community he created. Very emotional with Zelda and Mother 3. Has an unhealthy lapis addiction. Skin is Giovanni and has a podcast with other housemate Alex, the Temporary Podcast. MC is 'Matthew Cutter Game'. Cutter was a friend.

**Etho**

Etho joined with MC in December 2011 and has brought his famous dry humor and trickery to the server. Besides starting off by pranking Guude, and he's keeping it that. Great at UHC and PVP but his kryptonite has been Pause. Also has a friend named General Spaz. A member of Team Canada.

**Docm**

The German redstoner

**Kurt**

The Far Lander. Is defined by his Far Lands or Bust series far more than Mindcrack, and over $100,000 has been raised. To get this out of the way: He's never died in FLOB, he'll hit F3 at the end of a 100% charity stream, he's in 1.7.3 because the Far Lands have been removed. And the red stuff is clay. Also an avid astronomer and Team Single Malt Scotch member. Indeed.

**Zisteau**

Famous for LPs of Kaizo Caverns, Zisteau is a brilliant Mindcracker. His pranks are legendary, massive, and planned far in advance. He has a lava obsession, and a problem staying away from pranking. In addition to build a floating Lens, Zisteau has spent months building a village just to blow it up. He's that kind of guy, and very OCD too. In FTB he has a secret base hidden where nobody knows how to reach it. If you try to seek it

**Anderz**

The swearing Swedish viking. Has quite the dedicated fanbase, and puts out the most frequent FTB contest. Doing videos is just pure fun for Anderz. That and he finds gold and diamonds pretty easily to others' annoyance.

**Pyrao**

A Northern Irish university student, he had the most subs of anybody. Talks about everything from college to very in-depth existential thoughts in his video. His skin is him in a lizard suit because why not?

**Millbee**

A Welsh gamer, and gets better with drinking. Starves to death every once in a while to his annoyance.

**GenerikB**

The hermit, Emerald Wars on FTB, and was just racing to commander in BLOPS2, all with BdoubleO.

**BTC**

Joining in October 2012, and joined the army and served in Iraq. BTC is a down-to-earth guy but also quite the badass. He has his own public server and is still looking for a special someone. Not-so-secret Saturday.

**PaulSoaresJr**

A long-time big Minecraft LPer, Woman, Minecraft. The oldest server member, Paul is starting a base called Lonely Mountain. He's also sure chickens are out to get him, and likes putting his adventures on the subreddit.
 
###Retired Mindcrackers

**Madcow**: Second ever Mindcracker

**Alc**: Third Mindcracker

**Epsie23**: The other guy that 100%ed Contest 1 with Nebris. Removed due to inactivity

**Crysix**: Another of Guude's WOW friends

**Kuroro**: Kurururururu was removed due to inactivity and generally being annoying and 'improving' Guude's builds without permission. ""He was born without the ability to form ideas."" Still watches Guude and Beef to this day.

**Kennydyzak**: 1/2 of 2creditstoplay

**Stennent**: Guude's first Minecraft subscriber. Was rarely on the server

**Davmandave**: 2/2 of 2creditstoplay

**JustD3fy**: The 1st place winner of Contest 3 he was a long time follower of Vintage Beef,False,self,t5_2to85,1367201325.0,,specialmoderator,t3_1daobv

Welcome To UHC XI
======

Hello ladies and gents, and that means excitement, indecision, paranoia, and a really good time for our viewers.

A quick intro to newbies: Ultra Hardcore is a minecraft gamemode in which a number of Minecraftians are dropped into a limited size map, require gold ingots) and health potions, which now require a gold block.

First of all

Secondly, however.

Third, no nighttime. What does that mean? Very dangerous caves with increased mob numbers, and a very dangerous surface with players who aren't afraid of getting trapped outside.

And last but not least, this guy has too much on his plate for that, but we're all excited to have him with us.

As always, where I will remain until it's time to write up EPISODE 2. Let the games begin!

-Aubron

Hello and again ladies and gentlemen, and the Illustrious SethBling! This season we're looking at teams of two, in a fierce deathmatch for supremacy. Additional rules for this season include no regen potions, and only the use of natural caves (no digging for caves). So without further ado, I give you your teams!

Some of the MCFS people are very mad right now. But even though I feel pretty damn depressed (and a little drunk) I'm thankful to MindCrack for bringing us together. I'm also really sad for Danny, many of you were really supportive for many of us. I realize this will probably be voted down, but it needs to be said.
I hope each and every one of you have a fantastic day. I'm gonna drink some beer, and I do what I want.

Peace Off. We will meet again.

Hello Mindcrackers

I care for a 11 y.o. boy who’s a huge Minecraft fan.  Unfortunately, and he cannot really play the game anymore.  So now he gets his « Minecraft fix » from your videos!  ;)

I know that, it’s your job.  

But I thought you might like to know that your videos actually do make a big difference in this kid’s life.  He loves you all soooo much...  You should see how involved he gets in UHC, Kurt of course, as well as Beef, Etho and Pause.  

So to all Mindcrackers

I've been living a lie for the past two years

Two years ago, I found a wonderful voice actor who was more than willing to help out, voicing over my video with scripts that I sent him, and he is the voice of the ""Etho"" that you all know and love.

I was, and record videos under my own name, ethoslab was too big, I couldn't pull back the curtain and reveal the lie. I had to hide my identity so that people wouldn't put 2 and 2 together. That all changed today however.

Earlier today I was informed that Julian Spaz (pictured [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A8azOsgCIAAPsSz.jpg)), and all the mindcrack community. We will always remember him fondly, even if he couldn't correctly pronounce simple words like ""Lava"" or ""pollen"". Seriously, what kind of paid voice actor can't pronounce simple words? But I digress...

By necessity, you will be guaranteed to be whitelisted to Mindcrack, even if no other word in your application is spelled correctly or put together in any meaningful way.

I hope we can still be friends.

Well

I really don't understand people who claim that Etho doesn't give any content in his videos. I'm French
I mean
Etho is pedagogue
He invents so many things/logicsredstonethings/games !
The tamagotchi, hooperclockthing,... And even if he doesn't make a lot of montage, his transitions are so original and funny.
This is undeniable that he put lot of work/time/(love?) in his episodes, Etho is the BEST minecraft youtuber ever. 
Even his first alpha ""home"" he shown in his firsts videos is way better than many actual minecrafter.

So, because you are amazing, you speak really clearly so i can understand 99% of what you are saying and improve my english.
Thank you very much for all Etho

I am actually sitting here embarrassed that a lot of these people are my subscribers. They come to this video and judge these other humans like they have some kind of right.

The convention has a lot of events and it is all about having a good time. I understand that some people are not capable of just relaxing and having a good time but to come to this video and just belittle the appearance of others and act like they are above it all just makes me sick. It is times like these I really question the people I am trying to entertain and it makes me sad.

I know people are going to say don't read the comments or ignore the haters or don't feed the trolls or whatever other one liner is commonly used to brush away this kind of abuse

1376410879.0,1kaadm,Millbee: you're screwing this up,GlassHalfAwesome,787,402,481,"He made a mistake. He posted a video with uncensored nudity. It doesn't matter that it was animated nudity

Youtube did what they do and banned his account. What happens next will be very important and Millbee is already screwing it up.

He did the right thing by contacting his partners, being patient, etc. He also received offers of help from the entire Mindcrack community as well as Totalbiscuit. That's all great.

Let's look at it from a business perspective. YouTube has a partner with a growing viewer count that posts quality content reliably. That's someone you want on your team. Unfortunately

It was his first offense (according to him) and it wasn't a 20 minute long porn video. It was less than a seconds worth of accidentally uncensored nudity. This would easily be fixed by removing the offending video and unbanning the account.

That's the business smart decision to make.

Now Millbee is fucking that up.

In 1 day we went from professional Millbee to this:

* [Tells his fans to harass YouTube](http://i.imgur.com/ulZVjwK.png)

You may try to argue that this tweet isn't him trying to incite an e-riot. If you tell a group of people ""hey

* [Has it even been two days yet?](http://i.imgur.com/0hl6ef6.png) 

I just checked. It's only been 40 hours. Not even two business days. Do you not understand how big of a company Youtube is? Realistically it would take at least a couple days to get this straightened out.

* [Seriously? Trying to guilt trip YouTube?](http://i.imgur.com/XKpt8Si.png)

You need to calm down. This isn't your parents deciding whether or not you get to go to the beach with your friends. This is you speaking with a company regarding your professional partnership with them.

Anyone who looks at this situation would immediately recognize that it's a smart business decision to unban your channel. At least

* [If anybody thinks you're being childish?](http://i.imgur.com/omJywmy.png)

You are being childish. Would you act this way if you had to go sit in a boardroom with 4 YouTube employees and explain why you want the ban lifted? I would hope not

* [More of the same](http://i.imgur.com/OeC2mf7.png)

Who can you harass? Really? You have at least a dozen other YouTube partners on your side (including some pretty big ones.) Do you think any of them will be proud to have the back of someone this immature?

Last night I was 100% sure you would get your channel back. It's the smart business decision. Now you're fucking it up.

**edit:** [new tweet since I posted](http://i.imgur.com/yTlOIfy.png)

Your network hasn't even been on this for one business day. ~~Get the new channel setup and start uploading your videos. It's possible that you might not get your account back so you may as well be prepared for the worst.~~

**edit2:** apparently it's against the YouTube ToS to make a new account after you've been banned

**edit3:** I've been getting a lot of complaints about my comments regarding YouTube's removal process. I've heard countless times that every video

[This help page confirms it](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027?hl=en)

&gt; YouTube staff review flagged videos 24 hours a day

&gt; Flagged videos are not automatically taken down by the flagging system. If a video doesn't violate our guidelines

When you report a video it asks for the exact time that the violation occurred. The people who review the videos don't need to watch every second of every reported video

Millbee's video was reviewed by an employee of YouTube and it was determined to be in violation of their Terms of Service. The account was terminated because of it.

The ""three strike law"" that people keep bringing up is for copyright infringement. There's no strike system for this type of violation

[Youtube's copyright infringement guidelines (which don't apply in this case)](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2814000?hl=en)

**edit4:** I love these responses to the post:

&gt; It's not hurting him

&gt; All he's doing is raising awareness. If the mob backs off then nothing will get done.

So these immature actions aren't hurting him because YouTube is so big they'll just ignore it but at the same time he needs to resort to these actions otherwise YouTube will ignore him? Which is it

**edit5:** A new message from Millbee:

&gt; Until they admit they are wrong and reverse this great abuse of their own system

Millbee what are you doing. I couldn't cringe any harder if I tried. You're not leading an army into battle

You're acting like a child. Any business professional who reads this would not want to do business with you. Guess what

There is no injustice here.

http://www.youtube.com/t/terms

&gt; YouTube reserves the right to decide whether Content violates these Terms of Service for reasons other than copyright infringement, pornography, obscenity, or excessive length. YouTube may at any time, without prior notice and in its sole discretion, remove such Content and/or terminate a user's account for submitting such material in violation of these Terms of Service.

Work with them. Stop trying to grandstand

**edit7:** A couple of comments have brought up the 3 strike system with the Community Guidelines. 

[Link to the help page](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032?hl=en)

Remember that this incident doesn't fall under the community guidelines. Millbee stated that he received an email for his First Strike but his account was closed anyway. Regardless of the strike against him,False,self,t5_2to85,1376438458.0,,,t3_1kaadm

1368885496.0,1ekr5x,B-Team Discussion,Guardax,650,279,658,"Okay

First off

Now back to the B-Team. Recently their videos have been very competition based. To sum it up:  Race for Commander, 'B'lazing Saddles. Basically the B-Team is in an eternal competition. Emerald Wars ended and there were feelings that it might have been rigged. I'm not saying it was, but *there should have never been those feelings*. If Generik was going to kick BOO's butt in the competition, then so be it. The B-Team's answer is that they're entertainers. That's true, but I want unscripted entertainment. The B-Team hunt for Slimey Sammy video was funniest at the end. Why? Because it was unscripted and you could very much tell. If you watch the Cowboy Olympics video, the beginning was painfully scripted. But here's the thing too: I like the B-Team. Generik and BdoubleO are some of the best LPers out there. (And don't get the idea that I'm blaming Generik or anything, I'm not, I want his commentary. That's why I watch Building with BdoubleO, it'll get funnier. Like the Adlington incident. That was hilarious because BOO was genuinely freaked at Adlington coming for them. Any BOO moment in DOOKE or UHC is a quip he makes off the cuff. 'B'lazing Saddles could work if there's just a theme of the LP. Maybe for example: the sherrif wants them to go get emeralds. Okay. Don't spent 15 minutes on the set-up, Generik doing redstone. It's good stuff. Basically

**TL;DR**: I don't want characters

**EDIT**: And don't downvote people with different opinions. That's not cool

**EDIT 2**: Hey mods, *please* have a level head. This isn't a forum to insult the B-Team unconditionally, or me for that matter.  *Please, PLEASE* try and have a nice discussion.",,False,self,1368897354.0,t3_1ekr5x

Hello ladies and gentlemen.

Today I'm releasing this at our new time of 5:45

Tuesday we met our teams and lost a ton of health, and attention must, by necessity, move from survival to stage one of the challenge: Blaze Rods and ender pearls. Will we see our first death today? Will someone think to seize and fortify the portal early? Find out today on

Everyone in the Youtube comments seems to be sure that it's a spider... some are even saying it's a Brown Recluse Spider. I can safely say that whatever it is that's biting Etho is definitely NOT a Brown Recluse Spider, might lead to serious tissue damage. ([A photo of a Brown Recluse Bite. NSFW](http://imgur.com/vQhczoF.jpg)) Etho mentioned that the welts do in fact go away, ruling out this as the biter.

Another hypothesis is that it's bed bugs. This is not the case, as there are almost always more than one. 

No. I personally believe that Etho is getting bit by a [Kissing Bug.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triatominae) These insects often have their bites mistaken as spider bites

Kissing Bugs bites aren't dangerous *per se*, turning one bite every now and then to much, much more.

I definitely think Etho should keep looking around his bedroom for an insect the size of a penny or smaller (it will be visible to the naked eye and have reddish-brown wings). Continuing to change your sheets and looking under your mattress pads/bed could are both great ideas.

Source: I'm an insomniac that hates bugs and I've spent many a sleepless night looking up what bad things try to snuggle up with me

**TL;DR: Etho

**EDIT:** Changed some Brown Recluse information per /u/Sadsharks' clarification(s).

I've heard many of you mention that you guys are humbled when you hear such things, but there are more going on than you will ever know. You should feel proud IMO, what you do might seem small but it helps kids push further through their day. Thanks again for all you guys do.

1350619202.0,11qbj3,Mindcrack: 2 Year Anniversary,Guardax,349,35,112,"2 years ago today a man named Jason in South Carolina decided to upload his first Minecraft video. He called it 'Mindcrack' because it was 'so fucking addictive'. He thought it would be buried in millions of series' but would do it for fun. Jason began to began to create a loyal following of a few people

He decided to start a server with his friends: madcow, and theJims. With him and them they became the 'First Five' members. Only theJims and Jason are still around today. He added another Let's Player, Jsano because he was terrible at Minecraft. A contest was held, adding Nebris, Epsie, Adlington, and Kuroro. Stennant, was also allowed on.

In April Mhykol was invited but stayed inactive for the rest of Season 2. A second contest was held. Vintage Beef, and Shree got on the server. 1.8 dawned on the horizon and a third season was started. A final contest let Pakratt, JustD3fy, and Arkas on the server. BdoubleO is invited. Then the LPer invites began. Pause, MCGamer, Etho, Doc, Zisteau, and GenerikB are now on. Avidya returns.

However in the process, Crysix, epsie, stennant, kuroro, 2creditstoplay, and justd3fy have left.

So that was my hopefully eloquent opening. (Anyone notice Jsano and Jason are anagrams of each other? Guude and Jsano really are one person). Mindcrack at 2 Years! Who would have noticed? Well I'm glad that I did as this really is a momentous occasion to be celebrating. 

To start: let's thank Jason aka Guude. Guude has been responsible for this whole thing, and has a new baby daughter and now makes a living just off YouTube. It has changed his life, but not just his.

Everyone on the server that currently lives off Mindcrack could not have done so without Guude. To my knowledge these are: Etho, BdoubleO, MC, Doc, and Beef. There may be more. They could never have gotten their dream job if Guude didn't introduce them to this community.

However, I feel connected with the divines' and things like that. They're great people just serving us, but they're not famous. At least not yet.

Mindcrack started just as a hobby for Guude. I doubt he ever thought it would reach this level. In fact

I disagree. Take this subreddit. It has almost 11, freaking high-rolling Pause). I see daily interaction by the Mindcrackers. They're not high-rolling, they pay attention and love their fans. That's what makes this community so special and different from any other. The amount of interaction with the Mindcrack fans.

I've heard stories of videos getting people through tough times in their life. I've heard a story of a person learning English through the videos. Me

The point I'm making a bad job of getting at is this: This is a great community

And now I present the finale of my series to honor Guude and Mindcrack. You guys are awesome. This link links to a playlist of all the Countdown videos in reverse order. Watch through all of them

Here we go: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znpD6UKDi3Q&amp;list=PL-E11gMQ-0cD2H-G7h3kY6ObsW5Ovi8GG

Enjoy.

Here's to two years and three seasons

-Guardax

----
Okay here's the part where I thank everyone for their support in my Mindcrack countdown series. Here's the list of people to thank: My 471 subscribers (holy shit) for subscribing for the series (maybe LPs can't promise), Doc for liking the video I made of him, Generik for liking, commenting on and favoriting the vid I did of him, Guude for liking Pause's vid, MC for commenting on his, Millbee for liking, and favoriting his

*Phew*

So thank you guys for supporting me

Also new project start: On a publicly viewable but privately uneditable Google Doc I will be making a chart of all of Guude's Mindcrack videos 'the official Mindcrack register'. I will start this project very soon

Allons-y! (Team Kurt for life

Let me start by saying thank you to everyone. This is truly an awesome community. I got so much support and nice comments from everyone

Many of you and those on youtube expressed interest in actually making this a full movie, we need the MIndcrackers to record lines if we really want to make this happen.

I figure if the finished product goes in the [MindcrackNetwork Channel](http://www.youtube.com/mindcracknetwork) and would then make the Mindcrack server money, since the money would go to support the server they play on.

In the previous paragraph I talked about getting the community involved. I think this project would be so much more special if more of the community helped to make it! I've already have script writers on standby and other things that could be done by the community are editing the Mindcrack server map (removing weird blocks, editing existing ones etc.) If you are interested in helping build the maps for the movie, send me an email at endersoup@gmail.com, subject line ""building"" If the Mindcrack guys wish to continue with this project I'll send all of you emails with further details, I won't spam this poor subreddit with anymore of my crap :D Anyone that helps will be put in the credits.

One more question before I finish



If anyone has anymore questions you can contact me by email

endersoup@gmail.com

youtube.com/endersoup


TL:DR: Mindcrackers! Would you voice act in a Mindcrack movie? Would you do it if it went on the MindcrackNetwork Channel and supported the server? Community! Want to help? Read above for details.


**EDIT: Guys please keep the suggestions etc. for the movie in an existing thread or post one at /r/mindcrackmovie I don't want to make anyone angry

The Far Landers beat that in *less than a week*. So Kurt upped the ante to $8, and we ended Season 2 at the 292202 Monument.

Season 3 began with a $29, even reaching 240% of the goal, getting BdoubleO to Minecon Paris. And we ended the season at the 699492 Monument. 

Then Season 4 began saving Wolfie with the ambitious goal of $100

Let's go over the totals from the ChipIns on his website.

**Season 2**: $11

**Season 3**: $70

**Season 4**: $14

And then factoring in the money that Canadians 4 Kidz raised for FLOB..

**Canadians 4 Kidz**: $5

We get that Kurt has raised...

***$102

#MASSIVESOILERSAHHH


-

The first time that GenerikB is actually killed by a player is season 10, Avidya, Mhykol) had been doing pretty well. They had lost almost no health. It wasn't until AFTER GenerikB's head was in their posession that they began to take damage, and the Iron Kurtain had finally fallen to mortality. They happened to have a little bit of good luck with Nebris's team, granted, but that was only a failed attempt at murdering sobriety. The cursed head sent his former teammates (Pottymouths, Anderzel and Milbee) to avenge him by killing Sobrity. Unfortunately, and MAN was wiped out. 

But what did the cursed head do? The head has mysterious ways of getting the job done, Team GuudeBJ. From then on, Team Sobrity and Team Guude BJ would be stuck in a vortex, a time ripple, which would bond them to the same fate. They were together paralleled until death. And I can prove it.

For the sake of this analysis, it gets really eerie soon.

1. Each team is walking around the edge of the map in a circle. They are always opposite each other. They find each other's bases at the same exact time

2. Both Teams have a member fall into a pool of water

3. GuudeBJ begins taking damage in the snow biome during the night. Sobriety begins taking large amounts of damage in the caves.

4. Both teams fight and kill a member of BlameTheGenerikBeef. 

5. Both teams fight another team in a swamp. Not the same swamp. But a swamp. 

-----Now hold your breath

6. Baj is shot by Beef. Remember when I said Baj is the parallel version of Mhykol? Mhykol is caving just a few minutes later

-----As we know, most people don't realize they die in very similar ways.---------

7. Remember, Team Pimp and Team GuudeBJ have their face off. Unfortunately for Guude and Jsano, they end up trapped in a hole. 

8. Guude is very quickly brought to low health by MCGamer

9.Flash Sideways to Kurt and Avidya. Kurt is placing the head of GenerikB on a fence. But no. With a single cry of ""Doc's Here!""

10. Flash back to to fight between GuudeBJ and Pimp. Guude has died

11. Mcgamer finds Jsano. Jsano is set on fire

12. Flash forward to the fight between Avidya and Uppercats. What some people don't realize at this point, leaving only him to fight for his life. Poor guy :( . 

13. Back to the Parallel, in the heat of battle. 

14. Let us remember, is about to die, the entire forest is on fire, burning all around him? Parallel. 

15. fortunately for Avidya, but Avidya also eventually dies. The team that killed GenerikB, Sobriety, is now dead. However, The head still has unfinished business.

---------- The following might ruin the end of season 10 for you


16. During all this, is near death. He is caving for awhile, with a little luck. Finally he decides to go and end it, and fight team Uppercats at 0,0. 

17. The head wants beef, using the magic hermit powers of a disembodied head, GenerikHead plagues Uppercats with cloudy minds and mistakes. The head is trying to weaken them for beef. 

18. Beef finally gets there

19. The head now takes a slight revenge on Team Uppercats for killing the last member of BTGB. Incidentally

20. As the head had done to Avidya, the last teammate of BTGB, was also punished for his murder. BdoubleO's teammates were killed off, leaving only him to fight for himself, just as Beef and Avidya had to. The cycle has partially repeated itself. BdoubleO is sadly murdered. 

========


And that's it. Why? Do you ask? Why would the head choose GuudeBJ? My theory is because it knew that they would take damage and eventually die. 

The head lay where it had fallen off of a dead body,False,self,t5_2to85,False,,dinnerbone,t3_1gbd1c

AnderZel has been replaced by PewDiePie because people prefer PewDiePie.

The Yogscast have joined the server to bring in more viewers and 12 year olds.

To avoid confusion with seasons 1-3

The Podcast will now be hosted by Simon

The B Team have been legally seperated and replaced by the Yogscast. The common catchphrase M'Yaaah See has also been discontinued.

Etho now runs the Whitelist.

Because of the younger target audience, BTC and Shree, have been forced to change.

Pranking has been officially abolished because it is griefing.

Kurt has been replaced by Millbee in his Far Lands Or Bust series.

Feed the Beast has been changed to Tekkit.

Arkas is now forced to do daily episodes or must pay Seth and bribe Etho to keep him on the server.

Baj is now American

And finally

If you are wondering where I got these leaks from

UPDATE: Etho has now had his face surgically removed and replaced by Guy Fawkes Mask.

We maintain a top 100 in # of submissions (#81 as of this writing), and when I see us talked about in other communities, it's usually [positive comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1j0yoa/lets_discuss_lets_players/cba803h). *Usually.*

###Rule Clarifications

Today we've moved an [expanded version of our rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/wiki/rules) to the subreddit wiki system. There we hope to flesh out exactly what is and is not allowed, we will be enforcing them, strictly, across the board.

One of our biggest clarifications for this first round is the initial implementation of the content restrictions we discussed last round table. This will be done first by taking a poll of the community, and will help us to decide how to continue.

In the future, and to visit other suggestions.

Here are the potential restrictions up for potential approval during this round. This poll will run for 48 hours:

&gt;#####[Phonetic/Name/Visual Associations (Ethos water)](http://i.imgur.com/WHB4J.jpg)

&gt;#####[Posts meant only to communicate with a Mindcracker](http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1cn1ma/dear_generikb_youll_like_this/)

&gt;#####[YouTube Comment Screenshots](http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1j7r6p/doc_tells_it_like_it_is/)

&gt;#####[Memes](http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/rc6l8/bdoubleo_meme/)

&gt;#####[Circlejerk Posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1g5aza/i_propose_the_abolishment_of_the_baj_or_at_least/)

###Reporting

Reporting content is essential to the moderation process. We do not have the time to patrol every comment on the subreddit, report it. If you have the time to include a moderator message about why you reported it, that's great too, but by all means do the two clicks to report. Help keep the subreddit clean.

###Respect

Our rule to respect others has been in place since the very early days of the subreddit. And it has always been a gray area. As part of our expanded ruleset, and more specifically how they are expressed. How should we determine what to remove and what to keep when it comes to the spectrum of negative comments, ranging from polite suggestions for improvement, down to vulgar personal attacks and blatant trolling?

###Other Discussions

The round table is not limited to what we want you to talk about. We want to hear your voice on whatever issues you think are important. Also

Thanks for making us great

Aubron.

TL;DR: Rules, Report. Discuss.

At the beginning of May this year

In a week, but his sense of humor was definitely still there! One day while visiting, I was trying to covertly watch an old episode of OOG Legendary. Episode 9, the one with Guude's infamous fall of the walkway and the hilarious scream. Suddenly, from a cross the room, there was a chuckle. My uncle had laughed for the first time since he had been admitted. From then on, whenever I would visit, but the general humor of the episodes made him smile in his final days. He sadly passed away on May 14th

I'm not posting this for upvotes

I don't know why I feel this way; maybe because I had my wisdom teeth pulled and I'm just mad

Regardless

I'm seeing it on Etho's video, this person is most likely your elder by 10-20 years, already disrespectful in a sense. To call him an asshole or a cunt or a faggot (that last one grinds me) is disrespectful in a second sense.

Imagine the pressure that's on him. ~~He's playing with two of the most experienced PvPers in the history of Minecraft, think about that through Pakratt's perspective. An audience that large and that LOYAL (do not get me started on the 10 year olds, age is irrelevant in this situation) is going to tear you apart for any minor mistake that you make. He's not going to be perfect. Comments talking about how Pakratt should've saved Etho as if he's some VIP, even though Etho is more than capable of handling himself. He fought valiantly, but Pause is great too, so it was just the luck of the draw in a sense.

I'm getting off topic. Basically I'm trying to drive home that Pakratt is HUMAN, you aren't a coward or a chicken. In UHC, there are the living and the dead, and you just happened to be the living in that situation.

EDIT: Guys I didn't intended this to be a ""defend Pakratt"" post; more so I wanted to address the idea that Pak was getting insults thrown at him and I don't think it's right. He entered UHC and put out these videos for enjoyment purposes

He just hit 30% on his Child's Play charity fund raiser. Currently,688. Whether or not we can raise $2,783 before June 12th to get him to 40% or not, I think it'd be fun to try, and a nice way to wish him happy birthday without hopefully making him feel too awkward. So, go out and donate! Get your friends to donate! Get your parents to donate! Run your own little mini-charity fundraiser or livestream! 

Anyone with me?  Any suggestions on how to spread the word?  I recommend against spamming his videos

ComputerCraft peripheral developer here.

Just wanted to give you a few tips to help you on your way.

* Whenever using strings
* sleep is in seconds. sleep(1) is 1 second. You can use decimals if you want it faster - sleep(0.1)
* an easy way to quickly list all the methods is: textutils.serialize(peripheral.getMethods(""left"")). It'll dump the entire table for you as a string

Also quite an important thing to remember is that ComputerCraft itself isn't a huge mod

The more 'interactive' blocks aren't from ComputerCraft

It seems my series is the same as always. I am curious why the [sub growth](http://socialblade.com/youtube/user/AvidyaZEN) on my channel continues but the views are not matching?
 

* If **you** are not subscribed to my channel
* If you are subscribed but don't **watch**
* If you don't like **my videos** or me
* If you are subscribed and watch my videos
 
October will be 3 years doing this YouTube thing and I feel my consistency in the past has hurt my channel. I've been super consistent this year but the views are not increasing.  I continuously strive to improve my quality

Please provide honest feedback about what I am creating. If you feel what you have to say might be harsh or criticized by the reddit

**NOTE**: *I'm not asking for ideas of what I can do to get more views. I'm asking why don't you watch what I am creating.*

I anticipate this will be a big view drop for me

I will be doing a weekly series from the Mindcrack Vanilla server

I am feeling relived to finally bring an end to which has been plaguing my mind for some time now

I will be around most of the day to do a pseudo-AMA.

It seems kinda silly that the guy was flagged for spam for having a differing opinion, but I don't really have the time. I loved the first couple of seasons, but I feel that people exaggerated just how good it was to the point where it's been overdone. Although another reason I don't love the newer UHC's has been the lean towards PVP over comedy. Some set-ups, especially the singles set-up, seems to result in a lack of the witty banter that makes Mindcrack so great for me.

All that said, want. I'll still be subbed, liking, watching ads and trying to get all the Mindcrack content I can. Just giving a minority opinion :D!

Hey there!

I made a custom UHC viewer that allows YouTube InStream ads to play.  This gives the uploaders the same amount of revenue as viewing it directly on YouTube and significantly more revenue than other mashup services.

**[Edit]** Per user request, and change the quality of all videos. Enjoy!

The viewer comes with a few nifty features:

* **Synced players** – If one video freezes or lags it will resync itself to the others; pausing/muting/changing the quality/skipping ahead in one video affects all videos

* **Efficient player arrangement** – A simple algorithm determines the most efficient way to arrange and scale the players on any window dimension

* **HTML5 fullscreen** – You can put your browser into fullscreen mode with the push of a button

* **Simplified controls** – The controls are extremely minimal and fade out (like native video players) when not in use

* **Compatibility with ViewHC and SwigView** – SwigView example (""s"" for SwigView): [http://minemap.net/Mindcrack/uhc/?s=msahaAw](http://minemap.net/Mindcrack/uhc/?s=msahaAw)

I hope you like it!  As always, and criticism is appreciated.

**Creating links for this viewer**

I don't have a UI set up yet

* v = YouTube video ID (i.e. M0p1LnaY9mo)
* t = Start time (i.e. 10s)
* s = SwigView hash – **ONLY** use this parameter for SwigView compatibility

Example of a **standard** video link: http://minemap.net/Mindcrack/uhc/?v=jRcQrZ4kC80&amp;t=22s&amp;v=HSbAWWka-Xk&amp;t=38s&amp;v=W-iJUeYwFAA&amp;t=32s
