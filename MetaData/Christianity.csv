According to journalist Jose Luis Gonzalez-Balado, she treated every appointment a solemn duty.  But he remembers an exception.  When an appointment with the Nuncio took her through the poorest section of the poorest part of town, she asked her driver to stop so she could visit.  She lost track of time caring for a broken elderly man, bathing him and cleaning his home.  To the chagrin of her driver she ended up arriving quite late to her appointment, which drew her biographer to a sort of epiphany: ""For her,"" he said, ""the poor occupy the top place in the social hierarchy.""

For her.  And for you.

The fact that /r/Christianity met its goal in a day no longer surprises me

You are the body of Christ - we should *expect* the body of Christ to do amazing things!

I want to thank every one of you who donated to this cause.  We made 132% of our original goal in just over a week, with some of our larger contributions showing up late last night.  Your money will be used to serve those people who occupy the highest place in your social hierarchy.  For you, the last come first.  You have responded to Christ's command to deny yourselves - the money with which the Lord has blessed you - and dedicate it to furthering His Kingdom here on earth.  May God bless you richly for your offerings to Him.

Furthermore

I will be reverting /r/Christianity to its default settings

As we close this week of giving, their reputations, their lifestyles, their homes.  Deny all things, He said; deny yourself.  When you do, you take up His cross.  Then - only then - are you truly free to follow Him.

Jesus paid it all. So let us offer up everything that we have to follow Christ.  Lay it all down before His throne - our talents for His use, this $6,620 will be a drop in the bucket.

&gt;This is why this sub gets so much ridicule. This guy is straight up asking how to not sin from a CHRISTIAN perspective
This place is becoming straight up detrimental to Christians asking for Godly advice. I would really appreciate a Christian mod addressing this thread. This sub has basically become a place for people to deconvert Christians.
Sorry to get sidetracked OP, the best way to avoid falling into sin is to avoid whatever your first step to temptation is. Be aggressive in your prevention, and set strong boundaries for yourself. 
I would also say that homosexuality is an overblown topic, and still extremely lovable in God's sight. Be thankful that He has convicted your heart on this patticular matter, and ask for grace in overcoming it. Good luck brother! 
edit: Looks like the comment was removed and is no longer the top comment. Thanks to whoever did it

In the thread there was no small amount of fellow Christians advising the young man to continue on the path that he already felt convicted to get off of. But, I'm not addressing that. Different opinions can and do exist.

However, and trying to dissuade him from his Christianity.

Many of these posts were among the top voted comments.

I can point out rule 5 on the sidebar, what is the point of a sub like Christianity if we can't even have fellow Christians come here to ask for advice that is encouraging and end up with people trying to talk them out of their faith? Aren't there subs for atheism and religious debates already? I don't mean just this specific example, these kinds of threads happen all the time. Open practically any random thread on this sub and you'll see examples of this.

I'm not saying we should ban alternative opinions or debates or anything like that. I'm not *saying* anything

- Why aren't we enforcing rule 5? Debates and dissents aren't just had

- What is the point of this sub if not a place for Christians to come together, faithful community for each other? It's not that non-believers aren't allowed or even welcomed, but this is a place first and foremost for *Christians*. Why are some of the most passionate comments the ones trying to convert posters *away* from Christianity?

An elderly voice was on the other end, and apologized because I only recently got this phone number after switching from an Indiana to a Wisconsin phone number.  She sighed and said 'Okay, well my name is Tammy, how are you doing?""

I laughed and said I'm doing fine just winding down before bed.  She told me she's winding down as well, she told me she had had a stroke in 2010 and been confined to a wheelchair.  We talked for a bit about how she's struggling to get used to life in a wheelchair and how it doesn't seem fair God would do this to her.  Then she apologized for talking so much but she doesn't have many friends to talk to.  I told her I wasn't bothered at all, and asked her about her sister, curious as to why she didn't have her new number. 

No joke

I laughed out loud and told her that I'm white.  She seemed shocked and asked me how old I was.

""I'm 27.""  She gave a long ""Oooooh

""No no

""TWENTY SEVEN?  WITH A BEAUTIFUL BLACK VOICE LIKE THAT?""

She seemed to break the tension with this

""I've been looking for my someone.  I believe everyone has someone for them

I said

She responded, then.""

I asked her if she was religious

I asked her what church she used to go to

I promised her first thing in the morning I would call Mt. Zion for her and try to figure out a way for her to attend church again.  She seemed taken aback by this and asked me if I was being sincere.

""Completely sincere."" I promised her. ""My word is my bond.""

She thanked me profusely and I managed to get off the phone with her shortly after that.

 

This morning I called the church for her and spoke with their Transportation department.  The woman listened to my story and told me they had a small van that has wheelchair access that can pick her up

30 minutes later I received another phone call from Tammy.  When I picked it up she was crying.  The Church had called her and scheduled her for sunday morning pick-ups, and had given up.  It was too hard.  Thank you so much for helping me.""  I said absolutely, any time, and she hung up.

""Mere Christianity"" will find this passage beneficial. 
This is from the chapter

If a good God made the world why has it gone wrong? 
And for many years I simply refused to listen to the Christian 
answers to this question
you say
simpler and easier to say that the world was not made by any 
intelligent power?"" Aren't all your arguments simply a 
complicated attempt to avoid the obvious?"" But then that 
threw me back into another difficulty. 
    
My argument against God was that the universe 
seemed so cruel and unjust. But how had I got this idea
 of just and unjust? A man does not call a line crooked 
unless he has some idea of a straight line. What was I 
comparing this universe with when I called it unjust? If 
the whole show was bad and senseless from A to Z
to speak
the show
A man feels wet when he falls into water
is not a water animal: a fish would not feel wet. Of course 
I could have given up my idea of justice by saying it was 
nothing but a private idea of my own. But if I did that
then my argument against God collapsed too - for the 
argument depended on saying that the world was really 
unjust
private fancies. Thus in the very act of trying to prove 
that God did not exist  - in other words
of reality was senseless - I found I was forced to assume 
that one part of reality - namely my idea of justice - was 
full of sense. Consequently atheism turns out to be too 
simple. If the whole universe has no meaning: just as
there were no light in the universe and therefore no 
creatures with eyes

   Yesterday I went to my youngest brother's confirmation and something happened. Call it the holy spirit or whatever but when that holy water touched my forehead I just felt like I was home again. The same church I was confirmed in was calling me back. I miss the community, I’ve been thinking about God a lot these past months and I think I’m ready to let him in again. While standing at the back of the church I could feel myself trying to push god out of my mind. I like Catholicism, they accept evolution, generally accept gays(not gay btw), they allow you to reach God on your own terms. I don’t know what God is or what he wants and I think anyone who claims to, Pope included is delusional but I want to let him into my heart again. I think it was singing “One Bread, One Body” that really solidified it. “..And we, we are one body in this one world” I’ve always believed this and even as an atheist I feel we are all connected.

   I’m going to attend mass this Sunday, advice, support, I’m not sure what I’m after, I guess that’s the whole point. I’m still an atheist but I’m ready to return to the church.

As a global community, we expect a panoply of views. There is, however, one thing on which we are united, and we wish to state it as emphatically as possible.

**We categorically denounce the audacious and vitriolic responses from Christians as a result of Jessica winning her lawsuit. Those who have participated in the attempted character assassination of Jessica using social media represent the antithesis of one of the most profound teachings of Christ: ""A new commandment I give to you, if you have love for one another.""**

I’ve been in churches all my life. When I was 13, I did feel change, but after the camp, I quickly fell into my old ways, and as I grew older, I got into worse stuff, like pornography. In spite of that, and going to church was a highlight of my week. I was pretty much a Sunday and Wednesday Christian

When I got to college, God is Not Great, and The End of Faith, I became an atheist. Some of that also came from finding reddit and r/atheism, but I really don't blame them so much. Anywho, over time, as I got more and more into a/antitheism, my friendships suffered

After I got home from college with a terrible GPA, I think they suspected something like that. My dad suggested that I look into transferring into Liberty University, and I did end up transferring into there/here. 

After deciding to come to Liberty mostly for the accountability here, I've been either doing that or working on transfer stuff.

Either way, then that explains origins well enough, and Jesus answers the why of the Moral Law. Last week was also Spiritual Emphasis Week here, and the pastor preached about Who We Are in Christ, explaining a lot of other stuff as well. 

So yesterday, I decided to go on to the next assignment for that class, which was a quiz on a chapter of one of the texts for the class. Said chapter happened to be about how to get saved. After reading the chapter, I decided to give my life back to the Lord since I had jumped out of his hands years ago and been running as far away from him as I could.

 He did apologize, I spoke politely and calmly--granted I cried a bit, but I told him what he didn't want to hear. He still wanted to hold on his stupid fantasy of him being void from sin and he didn't do anything wrong.  No he didn't hit me, yes I am okay. I don't know where this is going to leave us, but he kind of did soften up at the end. I think he might have had a tear in his eye, weird.

As I wandered through, it looked like it hadn't been used in ages, and almost seemed to go nowhere.

I was walking through the path, dips, twists, turns, but eventually this seemingly endless mess opened up at the top of one of the mountains, on an awesome cliff overlooking the entire area I live in. I sat down, ate my breakfast/lunch, and watched the sun as it slowly started to encompass the whole land.

When I finally opened my bible, until I eventually stumbled upon one that stuck out all too perfectly. I don't remember the exact verse, as I was too overwhelmed by all that was going on to pay much attention, but the verse talked about how in life we go through twists and turns, we fall, we get hurt, we even lose our way, it all leads to God.

After reading that verse, I've fallen, I've struggled to get up, I've lost my way. And I now know it all leads to the beautiful picture I beheld at the top of the mountain. Overcome with emotion at that point, I teared up, bent my head, and began to pray. And for the first time I didn't pray for forgiveness, I prayed to give thanks. Because for the first time

I've been lost for so long, with God, I will rise and stand again.

Throughout most of my life church was everything. My parents used to be those super religious types you hear about so often (borderline Westboro). We literally lived at a church for awhile. Even after we moved we still pretty much lived at church. We attended some type of church gathering almost every day of the week. Basically what I am saying is church was my life.

Don't get me wrong

Eventually it became too much. I've had some experiences that I'd rather not talk about right now that destroyed my faith. Ever since I've been lost. I just don't know what to do with my life anymore. Everything seems so pointless without God but I can't go back. I've tried to force myself to believe. I've tried praying, for some answers but nothing works. I'm just so confused and empty. 

That brings us here. This is pretty much a last ditch plea for help. I need some support on this and I have nowhere else to go. All the churches near me have a strong ""no homosexuality"" stance so talking to anyone there would just be a waste of time. 

It took me way too long to write this. I broke down and burst into tears more than once. I don't know what exactly I'm looking for. Just please

**Edit:** Thanks to everyone who is reaching out to me. I'm not sure what I believe but I do know that I appreciate all the help I've been getting.

1339511198.0,uxymn,I am a Christian and a scientist. AMA.,klenow,610,133,838,"Good morning! I volunteered to do an AMA on being a Christian and a scientist. Just a bit of background first:

Christian life: I was raised as a Christian in the southern US. I currently attend a small (~80 members) fairly new (just over a year old) church in the southern United States. I have attended a variety of churches through the years, to evangelical near-megachurch (~4000 members). I even spent a few years as an agnostic/atheist. My calling in the church is to work with youth and the underprivileged, and I try to do both as best I can. 


As for my scientific work, I did an [AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceAMA/comments/i0dse/i_study_the_role_of_infection_in_chronic_lung/) on that about a year ago. Read over that to get an idea, but feel free to ask science stuff as well. Just don't get upset if I talk your ear off....


And just to cover what I am fairly certain will get asked:


1) Evolution : It happened.  We don't have all the mechanics of it worked out yet and we won't for a while still, though. It makes no predictions and cannot be tested. 


2) Faith vs Evidence - Gould's concept of ""Non-Overlapping Magisteria"" is a good starting point for my thoughts on this, evidence is what we can see or detect (and I use the word ""see"" in the loosest possible context, bordering on metaphorical). Since faith is exclusively what we cannot see and science is based exclusively on what we can see, the two cannot possibly overlap. If you have no evidence, science says nothing about it. If you have evidence, it is outside the realm of faith. Yes, Occam's Razor. I know. We are to take the simplest model to account for what we see; but I'm talking about things we don't see. This is what Ockham himself believed (remember, but since belief in God is not based on logic or proof


That's not to say those topics are off limits....that's just a starting point.


I'll be off and on all day; I planned to do this today because I have a lot of 30 minute gaps in my protocols. So I'll be around for about half an hour and then gone for an hour or so

EDIT : I hope you're all happy now. Because of your intriguing and fun to answer questions, I love it that I'm not getting the ""standard stuff"" I feared I'd get. This community does NOT disappoint! Keep it coming!

EDIT 3: WOW. Just .... wow. The less creative trolls are coming out in the night, which is bad news. I'm headed to bed now. If I ignored your post, please repost it, I know I missed a ton. I've got a few I left to look at tomorrow, I'm in no condition to give anything proper attention right now. And if you got a snarky or nonsensical replay from me in the past half hour or so, please accept my apologies. I'm tired. I'll do my best to wrap it up tomorrow though.

Case A: Homosexuality is not a sin.  If this is the case then there's really no reason to forbid state-sanctioned homosexual marriages.

Case B: Homosexuality is a sin.  This is the trickier case.  I will spend the remainder of this post assuming this is the case.  I will defend the assertion that the Biblical position is still to permit state-sanctioned homosexual marriages.

First of all note that I've consistently said state-sanctioned

[1] God the Father:

[1A] *Adam and Eve had free will*.  By ""free will"" I mean that if one knew all previous states of the universe (both physical and metaphysical) one could not predict the choice a free will would make and that all choices that can be logically formulated are available.  The first aspect - predictability - is necessary to make God not responsible for Adam and Eve's sinful actions.  Sure God knew what they were going to do

[1B] *God respected Adam and Eve's free will enough to let them choose their own deaths and the deaths of other people.*

[1C] *If we are to model our behavior after what God does, should allow people to exercise their wills, today, even if it means their own demise. (Whether or not their wills are free in the same way that Adam and Eve's were is irrelevant.)*

[2] Jesus:

[2A] *Though Jesus gave commands

[2B] *If we are to be imitators of Christ

So, thank you from an atheist, and Why do Christians x? 

What I see instead is Christians taking Christianity apart while atheists and others cheer them on.

Since I've come here

Nothing is sinful about homosexuality

Nothing is sinful if it doesn't hurt anyone

The bible is NOT inerrant

The Bible is not divinely inspired

The Bible is not relevant

Paul is wrong

Creationism is impossible

The idea that anything with God could even BE impossible

Works are required for salvation

No one is going to hell/forever

Christians shouldn't be set apart

Nothing is wrong with atheism


I could go on.  I understand that just because i individually take issue with these it doesnt make them wrong.  My point is this-I expect Christians to have a backbone.  I get that most of you are not as conservative as my background of Christians.  I understand that you are accepting

I just think maybe we lean a *little* too far in the opposite direction.  Im afraid no one is going to come to Jesus reading this sub because the way you talk makes Him sound unimportant.  Honest

There has been an uptick in users coming here to harass Christians, or who come here asking advice of other Christians. 

This has to stop.

If you want to do those things there are already plenty of subreddits in which you can do that. This one isn't here for that. It doesn't matter how you experience things in your daily life so far as your behavior here is. You aren't the only person who has bad days or feels marginalized and you do not deserve a unique right to harass and belittle others.

There is no good reason why submissions where a person is concerned about a sick relative are met by people with chips on their shoulders. There is no good reason why when people seek advice from other Christians with similar struggles they are again met by people with chips on their shoulders. If there is a submission posing a question here

Allow me to be perfectly clear:

This subreddit exists ***primarily*** for discussions about Christianity by Christians though we welcome most general conversations about Christianity by anyone.

I don't know if people thought these things were OK to do here but they are not. Subverting conversations, flaunting the community policy, kicking people while they are down, hiding behind accusations of hypocrisy as though it was a defense of your own abysmal behavior are all things which can no longer be ignored and brushed away. Moderation will increase, and has, to match these issues.

We are currently drafting a new community policy and there will be an increase in moderation. If we need more moderators we will add more moderators. What you can do to help is to use the report button

We are open to ideas and may implement some and not implement others. If there are any better ideas on how to address these issues we are all ears. However pretending these issues don't exist or ignoring them can not be one.

Examples of the sorts of posts which there can be no more tolerance or blind-eyes for will follow. Almost exclusively these are from within the past 36-48 hours and importantly this is a small portion of the sorts of posts which could have been given:

There were at least 40 men who were attending the service. I was expecting about the same amount of women. There were only two

Two women sitting in the large room watching a TV of the man speaking downstairs. 

The older woman asked me to sit right next to her and that moment I knew everything was going to be okay. She had very broken English as she was Arabic, and that she was happy that I came to the Mosque even though I am Christian. 

She continued to tell me more things about Islam and why women wore headscarves and things like that (I decided to wear a headscarf to the service because I wasn't sure if I would offend anyone by not wearing one). When it was time for me to go, and told me that she loved me like her own daughter and that she hoped to see me again someday.

That was the first time I have ever felt so loved by a complete stranger. I didn't catch her name

As a former Atheist who recently gave his life to Christ, so many Christians view themselves higher than non-believers and have no humility at all. They are saved and you are not is the sense you get from them. But in comparison, they are no better than you, and sometimes are worse than you compared to societal standards. Looking at a Christian who is no better than you, but yet has a mentality or attitude that they are completely turns people off to Christ. So I urge Christians to humble themselves, and take a serious look at Jesus and his treatment of people. He hung out with the most wicked, the people that society looked down upon. He was humble and didn't put himself above anyone. If unconditional, I'm sure I would have given my life to Jesus Christ sooner than I did.

He asked me if I ever sinned, and for some reason (which I now see is probably the product of a professional scam artist) even began to confess things to him that I had never said out loud before.  It was... so freeing to admit all of the things that I had been holding so closely to my chest, and I felt a sense of peace and relief.  I was fortunate to have met this man, even briefly.  But then he asked me to turn to Matthew 5:38-43:

*“You have heard that it was said, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also. And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well. If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.*

I read it aloud

""I would

And for the next hour, offering my cloak and coat, both?  Yes, yes, yes, I kept saying.  I worship God, not mammon.

Finally he said

Now, or how I could have been so irrational, but the only thing that I can figure now is that he, this guy pretending to be interested in salvation, had led me to the natural conclusion that I really needed to be more free with my money.

So I gave him my debit card.  I slid it across the table.  

He chuckled and slid it back to me.  ""I don't want your money

He'd ask me to do the same thing over and over, but I finally found myself withdrawing $1,600 from my account (all I have, really) and physically handing him the money.  (""I don't want your debit card, pastor, but if you really believed in all of this, you'd hand over the cold hard cash."" ).  I handed him the envelope, ""Do you trust me to borrow this for half an hour?""

And I (yes, yes I do.""

""Are you scared

""I'm trying hard not to be

""Don't worry, ""Nothing bad is going to happen to you while you're in the hand of God.""

And he left.

That was the last I saw of that money.

There isn't a lot I can do at this point.  The police are coming to collect a report, I handed him my money freely, so there really wasn't a crime committed, I suppose.

I don't honestly know how this man got me to the point that I'd hand him all I had.  I was obviously dealing with someone who knew how to manipulate people, I really thought I might be dealing with something divine -- something ordained by God to happen.

I know I was a fool, and I am sad that I was taken advantage of.

Still, in all of the conversation that we had had that afternoon, about sin and forgiveness, Christian generosity and the importance of money... I found myself with a strange sense of peace and forgiveness towards that man.  I took time to pull over and pray for him, to pray that this man somehow free himself from the greed that led him to take advantage of me.  

I went home and told my wife about what I had done.  I admitted that I had drained our bank account and given the money away.  She was understandably furious with me.  How could I do such an irresponsible, there was shame, and there were moments of honesty shared between us that we hadn't had in long time.

But,"" she quipped.), and watched television in one anothers' arms.  

More than anger, I feel pity for the man that conned me.

That man makes a part of his living by manipulating and alienating others for his own benefit.  He knowingly hurts others, life.  It's difficult to believe, but I pity him, because he is so obviously missing something from his life.  I will suffer for quite some time because of my decision, but I still have things that moth and rust can't destroy.  I have a wife that loves me in spite of the stupid things I (regularly) do, a baby on the way, a job that allows me to build people up and connect them with God, I truly believe that God caused this to happen.  Not to punish me or anything (although that might easily be the case)

""Are you happy

""I really think so

""Why?""

""I don't know, so much to love about my life, I suppose.""

He reached for the Bible I had brought for our conversation.  ""Pastor

""You can, here, take mine.  It's a slightly more understandable translation.""

He took my money away

I know that this won't be read by many (or any) in this obscure subreddit

I figured I'd share my experience.,newchristian,518,105,282,"I was raised in a non-religious household. I was never taught anything about religion except that it was something that some people were in to

In my teenage years I started to become interested in The Big Questions  (life, history, philosophy, and theology. This insatiable desire for knowledge is a habit I keep to this day.

I took first to a sort of agnosticism, I always had this tiny little inkling at the back of my skull that atheism just wasn't right. I convinced myself that this was due to cultural contamination, or fear of the unknown, or my own intellectual weakness, and I did a damn good job of mentioning it to no one for the better part of two decades.

Life went on and I continued my self directed study. As I learned more and more about more advanced topics I started to realize that the universe was not nearly as simple and straightforward as I'd supposed. 

The tipping point for me came when I realized that I had an essentially binary choice in competing explanations for the physical constants of nature: a multiverse, all contained in some unknown and itself infinite multidimensional metaverse. God seemed the more economical choice.

I'd reasoned my way to an openness to the possibility of God

With my new found openness (that a Christian may have deemed ""having an open heart"") I said to God ""I am ready to accept you, if you are there. I want to have a spiritual experience, and if you are there, and if you see fit to grant one to me, I will accept it, and you, regardless of what challenges that may bring."" I fully expected nothing to happen and to go on as a newly minted agnostic, I think

So

I was filled with feelings I cannot describe. I was aware of God, and the sky over head. I made a promise to myself, and to God, and I intended to keep it. I was now a theist.

From there on out it was a matter of momentum. I believed that now that I knew there was a God that he would nudge me in the right direction. I didn't know what direction would be

Well, history. That was a couple of weeks ago. I've since been to church for the first time (I'm not so big on the tunes, but the sermon was great) and met privately with the pastor to discuss theological issues. I've started to learn to integrate my faith into my life, but it will be a long road. My wife was initially less than pleased but she is starting to settle into it and has even offered to attend Church with me this Sunday.

So, except that it is mine and I couldn't be happier about it.

*""As it was in the days of Noah so shall it be at the coming of the Son of Man.""* OK. So then

*""Men were eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage right up until the day that Noah entered the ark.""* No scary times

*""And* **they** *knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took* **them** *all away.""* Here's where you gotta pay attention. *Who* knew nothing about what would happen? Did Noah know? Certainly; God told him; he spent time building a boat. Who knew nothing? The *wicked*. So, who was left? The righteous. Noah and his family. The bad guys were taken in judgment, the righteous remained.

*""So shall it be at the coming of the Son of Man. Two men will be in the field. One will be taken and one left. Two women will be grinding at the mill. One will be taken and one left.""* Careful now - *who* is taken? Before you say the Christian is taken ""up"" - read it again - ""As it was in the Days of Noah *so shall it* be at the coming of the Son of Man."" What's the principle? Who is taken and who is left in the Genesis story? - Jesus says, the righteous remain.

Ps. 37.8-11: 8 Refrain from anger
    Fret not yourself; it tends only to evil.
9 **For the evildoers shall be cut off
    but those who wait for the Lord shall inherit the land.**
10 **In just a little while
    though you look carefully at his place
11 **But the meek shall inherit the land**
    and delight themselves in abundant peace.

So, the homeless shelters, the food banks. And you know what? For the first time in my life, I am *excited* to give the tithe. Because I feel like it's being used for what God wants. To help the helpless, to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked. Not to buy new benches for the church that already has nice chairs, or to pay the rent of the church building that is far above what any body of believers needs.

First of all sorry for my english

I guess this started around when I was 11, I just didn't find them appealing. I didnt understand it so I thought I was weird, I tried to convince myself some guy was hot, but in reality I didnt care. Instead of finding Justin Bieber and such hot, I was more interested in Emma Watson. I grew more and more attracted to girls, I thought I was a freak and just kept it bottled up until a week ago.

I really wanted to talk to someone about it, so I went to my priest.

Im a Catholic

he's never said anything about homosexuality before, for ages, and it was awesome. He was so accepting and supportive. He kept stresssing how theres nothing wrong with me, how its perfectly natural and that God loves everybody, regardless of sexuality. The conversation made me feel a million times better, and much more comfortable about myself and less like a freak :)

But the community accepted Danny, and started to help him. They brought him into their home so he could shower and wash his clothes and they bought him adult diapers so he could stay clean and they started the long process of tracking down his family whom he had not seen in years.

And then they found his family, and he woke up on New Year's Day sleeping in a bed for the first time in months and reunited with his family for the first time in years.

Around that time I joined reddit and was initially excited by the amount of non-Christian content.


 I continued to study religion, Sam Harris and various theist apologists. Eventually I stumbled on to their debates with Rabbi David Wolpe. IMO Wolpe adequately defends the possibility of a theistic God and perfectly counters Hitchens' arguments against the morality of the Judeo-Christian tradition as expressed in history. However, Wolpe emphasizes that belief isn't about chalking up arguments, facts, and hypothesis, but rather the expression of a human soul's longing for God.


At the same time I became annoyed by what I considered the intellectual arrogance of anti-theists and militant atheists on Reddit. The difference in tone of r/atheism compared to r/Christianity, the community is not antagonistic and tries to answer questions in a constructive way. Here you find members of a huge swath of the spectrum of Christian traditions discussing ideas amicably and even praying for each other. That attitude is inspiring, and something I wish occurred more often IRL.  On the other hand R/atheism with all it's constant reiteration of Christian ""hypocrisy, ""hate,"" and the ""superior ethics and morality"" of non-believers IMO is a place often focused on building itself up by tearing down others and their beliefs.

After more reading, I decided to recommit myself to Christ at Church today. Despite the annoyance of abandoning my karma, I quit using my old account so that I wouldn't confuse anyone who might see me posting from different perspectives.

**TL;DR** Thanks

**Atheists** I'd like to head off some comments I expect I'll get. 1) Having studied the arguments for and against God, God is real, and Christianity is true. This may be a rationalization. If so, fine, it's my rationalization. I won't ask you to believe if you don't feel the same way. To quote Jeff Goldblum, ""don't knock rationalization, it's more important than sex."" Even if I knew it with certainty it was all factually untrue, e.g. Islam. 4) I understand r/atheism does not reflect all atheists. I understand why you don't believe. I appreciate your arguments and ideas for helping me better define my philosophy of life.

If anything

&gt;**Bono:** My understanding of the Scriptures has been made simple by the person of Christ. Christ teaches that God is love. What does that mean? What it means for me: a study of the life of Christ. Love here describes itself as a child born in straw poverty, I think I know what God is. God is love, and as much as I respond [sighs] in allowing myself to be transformed by that love and acting in that love, that’s my religion. Where things get complicated for me, is when I try to live this love. Now that’s not so easy.

&gt;**Assayas:** What about the God of the Old Testament? He wasn’t so “peace and love”?

&gt;**Bono:** There’s nothing hippie about my picture of Christ. The Gospels paint a picture of a very demanding, car chases, evacuations, a lot of special effects, seas dividing, mass murder, adultery. The children of God are running amok, those of us who are trying to figure out our Christian conundrum, for, on the other hand

&gt;**Assayas:** Speaking of bloody action movies

&gt;**Bono:** I know, has left the building. [laughs] A list of instructions where there was once conviction; dogma where once people just did it; a congregation led by a man where once they were led by the Holy Spirit. Discipline replacing discipleship. Why are you chuckling?

&gt;**Assayas:** I was wondering if you said all of that to the Pope the day you met him.

&gt;**Bono:** Let’s not get too hard on the Holy Roman Church here. The Church has its problems, heads bowed, murmuring prayers, stories told in stained-glass windows

&gt;**Assayas:** So you won’t be critical.

&gt;**Bono:** No, or Sister Ann doing the same in Malawi, or Father Jack Fenukan and his group Concern all over Africa, when I meet priests and nuns tending to the sick and the poor and giving up much easier lives to do so, I surrender a little easier.

&gt;**Assayas:** But you met the man himself. Was it a great experience?

&gt;**Bono:** [W]e all knew why we were there. The Pontiff was about to make an important statement about the inhumanity and injustice of poor countries spending so much of their national income paying back old loans to rich countries. Serious business. He was fighting hard against his Parkinson’s. It was clearly an act of will for him to be there. I was oddly moved by his humility, he seemed to be staring at me. I wondered. Was it the fact that I was wearing my blue fly-shades? So I took them off in case I was causing some offense. When I was introduced to him, he was still staring at them. He kept looking at them in my hand, so I offered them to him as a gift in return for the rosary he had just given me.

&gt;**Assayas:** Didn’t he put them on?

&gt;**Bono:** Not only did he put them on

&gt;**Assayas:** I don’t remember seeing that photograph anywhere

&gt;**Bono:** Nor did we. It seems his courtiers did not have the same sense of humor. Fair enough. I guess they could see the T-shirts.

&gt;***Later in the conversation:***

&gt;**Assayas:** I think I am beginning to understand religion because I have started acting and thinking like a father. What do you make of that?

&gt;**Bono:** Yes, but the thing that keeps me on my knees is the difference between Grace and Karma.

&gt;**Assayas:** I haven’t heard you talk about that.

&gt;**Bono:** I really believe we’ve moved out of the realm of Karma into one of Grace.

&gt;**Assayas:** Well

&gt;**Bono:** You see, a tooth for a tooth, or in physics; in physical laws every action is met by an equal or an opposite one. It’s clear to me that Karma is at the very heart of the universe. I’m absolutely sure of it. And yet, along comes this idea called Grace to upend all that “as you reap, so you will sow” stuff. Grace defies reason and logic. Love interrupts, if you like, the consequences of your actions, because I’ve done a lot of stupid stuff.

&gt;**Assayas:** I’d be interested to hear that.

&gt;**Bono:** That’s between me and God. But I’d be in big trouble if Karma was going to finally be my judge. I’d be in deep s—. It doesn’t excuse my mistakes, and I hope I don’t have to depend on my own religiosity.

&gt;**Assayas:** The Son of God who takes away the sins of the world. I wish I could believe in that.

&gt;**Bono:** But I love the idea of the Sacrificial Lamb. I love the idea that God says: Look, to selfishness, and there’s a mortality as part of your very sinful nature, and, let’s face it, you’re not living a very good life, are you? There are consequences to actions. The point of the death of Christ is that Christ took on the sins of the world, and that our sinful nature does not reap the obvious death. That’s the point. It should keep us humbled . It’s not our own good works that get us through the gates of heaven.

&gt;**Assayas:** That’s a great idea, in my view. Christ has his rank among the world’s great thinkers. But Son of God, isn’t that farfetched?

&gt;**Bono:** No, obviously a very interesting guy, had a lot to say along the lines of other great prophets, be they Elijah, Muhammad, Buddha, or Confucius. But actually Christ doesn’t allow you that. He doesn’t let you off that hook. Christ says: No. I’m not saying I’m a teacher, no, we can handle that. But don’t mention the “M” word! Because, and set you free from these creeps

&gt;***Bono later says it all comes down to how we regard Jesus:***

&gt;**Bono:** If only we could be a bit more like Him, or was He just a religious nut? And there it is, and that’s the question. And no one can talk you into it or out of it.

I'm not alone in this either, combined with how open-minded you all are towards us, it's just nice to see people with such different beliefs getting along so well. I feel like Reddit serves as some sort of model for the religious world to follow.

&gt;The person making the confession is not like a servant that gives account to his lord for the management which is given over to him because the lord could not manage all or be present in all places. The all-knowing One was present at each instant for which reckoning shall be made in the account. The account of what is done is not made for the lord’s sake but for the servant’s sake, do not raise the objection against the confession that there is no point in confiding to the all-knowing One that which He already knows. Reply first to the question whether it is not conferring a benefit when a man gets to know something about himself which he did not know before. A hasty explanation could assert that to pray is a useless act, because a man’s prayer does not alter the unalterable. But would this be desirable in the long run? Could not fickle man easily come to regret that he had gotten God changed? The true explanation is therefore at the same time the one most to be desired. The prayer does not change God, but it changes the one who offers it. It is the same with the substance of what is spoken.

**I've seen it stated elsewhere that /r/christianity is a mantle for politically correct Christians to display how tolerant they are.**

Ridiculous, it's getting more difficult for me not to buy into that, at least partially.

I've noticed a trend: it seems like two kinds of posts are downvoted in this subreddit, opinions, or concerns from more conservative Christians that find themselves relegated to the bilges of the thread.  And it's not because they're simply not being upvoted.  That's understandable and perfectly acceptable.  Rather, I'm referring to a propensity that this subreddit has to downvote, and thereby censor conservative viewpoints.

I also want to add that I realize that r/christianity has a diverse membership and is not as cohesive at it may seem. So I won't blame any one group of people.  But that being said

2. I was not avoiding talking to the atheists who offered advice as one person suggested.  I responded to everyone I could before signing off of reddit for the day.

If I didn't respond to you it was because of timing

3. To fill in some gaps for those wondering:

I'm 30.  I'm the family pastor but not the senior pastor.  I've been married for 6 years.  We have an elder board including the senior pastor.  We are evangelical non-denom. My assistant is a volunteer, are aware of the treatments and methods of easing or working through vaginismus.  She refuses any intimacy beyond a kiss.  Period.  This is not an excuse.  I'm just explaining some of the back story that people had related questions and comments about. I am bi-vocational so I have income outside the church.

4. I sat down with my wife first.  She says she already knew that I was emotionally cheating on her but that she had hoped it would just ""go away"".  She says she wishes I had not told her but that she understands why I have.  She cried (a lot).  I cried (a lot).  She says she doesn't want a divorce, including quite a bit of stammering and her understandably screaming.  There is more, but I'll just leave it at this for now...  She is gracious.

5. I met with a trusted elder and the senior pastor today.  We will meet tomorrow to discuss more in depth, be removed temporarily from my ministerial position.

6. I am much more conservative than Reddit's user base, and other-faith individuals here on a daily basis.  Yet I now find myself in the compassion and grace and tough love of so many people here that I usually write off.  The many, many personal messages and prayers are so incredibly appreciated too.   I have, at the very least, come to realize that I do not have a monopoly on truth or God.  I am a mess, swallowed up in my own depravity and eagerly pointing at what I consider depravity in others.  I repent.

I love my atheist brothers and sisters. I am thankful for those of you that engage our community here and discuss the challenges and questions of faith with sincerity. You absolutely are part of the reason that I love participating here.

That said, so we are equally as guilty. But while Christians need a theological correction here, I feel like you may not understand our perspective unless I elaborate a little.

When someone says, ""hey, that's awesome!"" or ""don't feel guilty, embrace who you are!"" I know that you're engaging honestly, and that you're trying to be encouraging, but you need to understand what your encouragement is saying from our perspective.

You're literally saying, to be blunt, encouraging someone to kill themselves spiritually (and sometimes physically too) when you say ""keep sinning, enjoy yourself!""

It's one thing to portray your viewpoint on the situation, or is maybe even just confused, hurt, or scared, you are, to be blunt, leading them away from Christ when you encourage them to sin more. This can happen with all kinds of sins

I don't want you to feel unwelcome. I don't want you to think you aren't allowed to share your perspective. But I would love for you to share some grace with us. We are very often lost and searching for our shepherd. When someone is suicidal, and I think you can understand why that would cause us pain to read posts by you pushing them in that direction.

No doubt this will offend some of you, not every single one that offers an atheist perspective. When you want to discuss scripture, or ask questions, or even get into some debate about interpretation, I'm always all ears. When you're telling my sister to go get laid more, you are hurting me, her

Perhaps the most painful statement a person can hear is, and shatter dreams. Often, people who have been betrayed guard themselves against future pain by deciding not to trust anyone’s love again. That settled conviction may even include the love of God.

The remarkable thing about God’s love for us is His promise that it will never end. The prophet Jeremiah experienced devastating circumstances that left him emotionally depleted (Lam. 3:13-20). His own people rejected his repeated calls to respond to God’s love and follow Him. At a low point

Yet, because His compassions fail not. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness. ‘The Lord is my portion,’ says my soul, ‘therefore I hope in Him!’” (Lam. 3:22-24). A person may vow to love us forever yet fail to keep that promise, but God’s love remains steadfast and sure. “He is the One who goes with you. He will not leave you nor forsake you” (Deut. 31:6). That’s a love we can trust.

O Love that wilt not let me go
I rest my weary soul in Thee;
I give Thee back the life I owe
That in Thine ocean depths its flow
May richer

**God’s love never fails.**

1364841926.0,1bfuc9,I never really fully understood the difference between much of Western and Eastern Christian theology until I heard this...,partofaplan2,392,96,184,"&gt; I had this brought home to me quite profoundly the second Sunday I attended an Orthodox church. My priest, he posed the question to me, “Does Father really think me so spiritually immature that I do not know what grace is?” So I responded very quickly

&gt; It was a revolutionizing moment in my Christian experience. As time passed, for instance, is not some commodity that God produces. It is not something He wraps up in a spiritual package and sends to us so that we can open it up and apply it to our lives. The same must also be said for faith, or mercy, or wisdom. None of these are things. They are activities of God within the soul of a human being. Grace is God at work transforming me. Faith is the Christ who dwells within me, reaching out to the same Christ who sits on His throne in heaven. Mercy is God expressing His goodness in and through me. Wisdom is God thinking His thoughts in me. Again, this is so crucial, for Christians and non-Christians alike

&gt; Perhaps it will become clearer as we apply all this to the question of imputed righteousness. Just as with grace, or wisdom, the Western mindset is at work here. It takes God’s activity of imputing righteousness and turns it into a thing called imputed righteousness. But just like grace, faith, mercy or wisdom, righteousness is not a thing. You cannot buy a can of it, nor is righteousness some sort of spiritual currency that God can apply to our account in heaven in order to erase the debt we owe Him for sinning against Him.

&gt; What is righteousness? It is not a thing, or use in some other way. No, righteousness is God’s perfectly humble, perfectly self-sacrificing, perfectly good, perfectly loving way of existing.

This Sunday after church I was discussing everything happening with another believer who was pro-choice

Here's the issue.  Abortion is wrong regardless of what the Church says, or marginalized, or hidden, or voiceless.  

So, popcorn style church service.  It seemed odd that that would bother me as a Christian, but it really did.  Nearly every speaker talked about God, some lead us in prayer, and the whole thing was even ended with a Baptist worship band playing while people left.  I feel like it was willingly placing us in a Church *vs.* State camp, which is a misdirection of where our argumentative strengths lie on this topic. 

I never thought I would hear myself saying something like this, and how damaging and costly it can be when we devalue human life, or see some in society as less valuable than others.  He touched on slavery, and how we used to tell ourselves that blacks weren't human as a way of justifying it.  Those were the kinds of arguments I was wanting to hear, and it took Mike Huckabee to finally start going in that direction after a couple dozen others took the stage to mostly recite platitudes about what God wants for our country, which wouldn't be convincing to anyone who was not already in our camp.

Oh, which I think can be a great reminder to us all, was an instance that happened when one of the speakers addressed the opposition.  I'll preface by explaining that since I'd shown up at the rally, there were pro-choicers yelling things, and being slightly disruptive.  Then one speaker said, ""we have something to tell all those out there in orange and red shirts"" (the colors those who are pro-choice elected to wear) and before he could say what he was going to say a voice rang out ""FASCIST!""  But then, without hesitating, ""we love you all.""  And after that I didn't hear any disruptive yelling from those in orange shirts for the rest of the rally. 

EDIT: I'm sorry if the way I opened this rant offended you.  I'm not going to change it because I don't want those in the comments to look like their complaints aren't justified.  I honestly didn't expect this post to get much attention, and I was hoping that one or two of you might share my frustration, and that we could have a cathartic moment together, but now that it's getting a fair amount of attention, I feel like I shouldn't have been flippant about the opposition.

This Sunday my church was talking about how we needed to raise money to build a cafe(sound equipment and new seating) for a church in Russia. As Christians why don't we spend less time in a building and more time out in the world helping our fellow man? 

How come in the modern church so much time and money is spent on topics/resources that don't feed the poor, how can we change that to make it a body of believers that strive to serve our brothers and sisters? Isn't that what Jesus intended when He sent out His disciples to create the Church?

Bear witness to my testimony, amen. But 2 years ago, I was not, I was polluting the temple that the lord so graciously has given me with drugs and sin. 

I was homeless

I ran away, and my will to live. To fill the emptiness inside of me I turned to drugs and began to smoke meth.

About a year and a half ago I met a young gentleman who I shall not name. He paid upfront for my time and we went to a motel. He tied me up and took a knife to me and cut me badly. He didn't say this but when I started to pray he became enraged and beat me even more saying that I was a stupid whore for believing in something that didn't exist. It was then I shut my eyes and got ready to die. 

I was lucky, left the door open, and just walked out. A maid found me and I spent nearly 2 weeks in the hospital. In the hospital the chaplain prayed with me and with his help I was connected to a small organization in Los Angeles that helped me transition from the street and my life as a prostitute to a healthy life in a real home with a real family.

Dear /r/Christianity

I am completely overwhelmed by all of the encouragement and support that you have given me. I submitted this post out of desperation on my mobile phone late last night when I felt like I was at the lowest of the low. Today I spent the whole day resting and reflecting. The comments here are nothing but a blessing to me...I have read every single one. Thank you so much

As for whether or not I'm part of a Christian community, and one of the devotion leaders of the church's youth ministry. My brothers and sisters in Christ have constantly reached out to me on a regular basis, but I would lie and deceive them to make it appear that my walk with God was going strong. I've been living a double life, going to church on Sundays and catering to church 'commitments' while living an excessively sinful life on the other side as a college student. No one in my Christian community ever knew, not even my parents.

I have no choice but to say everything as it is.
The shame I carry is immense..


But to God be the glory...I will read His Word more, because I feel that achieving this will pave the way for everything else in my life. I want my life to glorify God.

There's so much work for me to do.

'Are you ready to find Jesus?'

'Yes I am'replies the drunk, have you found Jesus?'

The drunk replies, shocked at the answer, dunks him into the water again, but for a bit longer this time. He pulls him out of the water and asks again, 'Have you found Jesus, my brother?'

The drunk again answers, but this time he holds him down for about 30 seconds.

Be the one who is genuinely kind and treats others as Christ would.  Be a living testament and maybe someday they will become interested in the New Testament.

You may be curious why I've decided to leave

1) In all of the thousands upon thousands of ancient Christian manuscripts that we have, either they have all been altered, which leaves me with a very uncomfortable feeling because then how can I trust that the entire body of Christian scripture has not also been drastically altered, or the alternative, that the name Jehovah was important for Jews, but wasn't meant to be all that important for Christians, and the name of Jesus was meant to replace it in importance. 

2) Blood, yet they were not, apparently they were excused because they were extremely tired and hungry. Given that situation, I don't see how a person could be asked not to take a blood transfusion when their life is in danger. 

3) The Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses tries to rewrite their own history on a regular basis. They regularly hold the mistakes of other religions up to the light and accuse them, they would label him an apostate and disfellowship him, even if he could do miracles, they would attribute the power to demons and not God. 

4) (bonus!) The Watchtower is basically interested in two things, their accumulated wealth is worth hundreds of millions of dollars, perhaps billions. Jesus had no place to rest his head, and said that whenever two were gathered there he would be, so no fancy meeting place was required, and he also placed a strong mandate upon his followers to care for the poor and to feed the hungry and less fortunate. 

I've moved on with my life now. I haven't been disfellowshipped

1360785269.0,18gp53,I conducted a phone interview with Fred Phelps Jr. of the Westboro Baptist Church as part of my research paper for my religion class.  Resub by Request,WaWaCrAtEs,328,49,274,"An Interview with Fred Phelps Jr. By: David Mc

David Mc: Could you tell me your full name please?

Fred Phelps Jr.: Fred Phelps Jr...which

D.M.: I'm sorry?

F.P.: You know the swimmer Michael Phelps?

D.M.: Yes

F.P.: If you Google his name

D.M.: [chuckle] Oh is that right?

F.P.: Isn't that interesting?

D.M.: [chuckle] OK

F.P.: Oh...truth.

D.M.: Proof?

F.P.: No. Truth.

D.M.: Oh

F.P.: Well, mushy, meaningless crap or all those fag parades...their definition of love is lust. Physical lust.

D.M.: Uh-huh

F.P.: The Bible's definition clearly says so is...telling your neighbor the truth. Warning them that their sin is taking them to hell. And that's proof. And that's love.

D.M.: Ok

F.P.: ...Yes

D.M.: Could you elaborate please

F.P.: Well

D.M.: --but do you believe there is a different punishment for these different levels?

F.P.: Absolutely

D.M.: Yes

F.P.: Sodom and Gomorrah was physically destroyed. If you believe what the Bible says, commanding that they have homosexual sex with the angels that were in his house and that's grievous... that’s a sin the Bible calls abomination.

D.M.: OK. If you could define salvation

F.P.: Rescuing..uh..a sinner from his eternal damnation...

D.M.: ...OK. How important was Jesus's ministry on earth in your opinion?

F.P.: Well

D.M.: Yes

F.P.: Well

D.M.: Uh-huh.

F.P.: And feed my children

D.M.: Uh-huh.

F.P.: And that's not talking about physically feeding...I mean it could include that

D.M.: OK. If..I'm not sure if you’re familiar with the verse

F.P.: Well

D.M.: OK

F.P.: But

D.M.: --Well

F.P.: --Sure.

D.M.: It is “For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.”

F.P.: ...Yeah

D.M.: Well

F.P.: OK, you're not going to be saved. I don't remember the exact lines...whoever believes on him will be saved. “The world” is used in many different ways throughout the Bible. It refers to the earthly geographical, sometimes it refers to the gentiles as opposed to the Jewish world, it..at no time does it include every single human being really...if...they included that at time in the front cause even then it didn’t include every human being. It's misused. It's clearly not every human being that...God did not come to love every human being or every human being would be in heaven. His love is impotent...his salvation is impotent if he has to rely on some week sinful humans to accept it.

D.M.: OK. Yes, I came across the Five points of Calvinism and that seems a lot like one of the five points.

F.P.: Uhh...whats one of the five points?

D.M.: Well

F.P.: --Yeah

D.M.: I'm sure he didn’t.

F.P.: Did Osama Bin Laden go to heaven?

D.M.: I'm sure he didn’t.

F.P.: Did Christ die for him? Did he send his son that Osama Bin Laden might be saved?

D.M.: I don’t know

F.P.: Did Adolph Hitler or the tyrants and murders...Stalin? We have dealt with this in great detail on our website. There is a special paper called the “John 3:16 Lie”. We’ve gone into great academic detail cause that verse is so fragrantly and sadistically misused. If the students in our colleges, they would flunk out of school so I would refer you to that paper that’s there on the website, the “John 3:16 Lie”, i think that’s what its called.

D.M.: OK. Is there any place for repentance for homosexuals?

F.P.: You know...uh...we've certainly been asked that many times over the years. there’s two passages in the bible that pretty well convince me the answer is “no”, where three different times describing homosexuals...god has given them up. You can't come to repent that so God has given you up and then the other passage would be, I believe revelations chapter 22:15, where there’s a list...5 or 6 types of humans who will never go to heaven...and the first on that list is dogs, and dogs is the Bible's metaphor for homosexuals.

D.M.: We're very close to being finished here. So this is kind of branching off of that question. Is it the church's opinion that it is entirely a choice to be homosexual? [crosstalk] Now I'm not asking about performing homosexual acts...I'm asking about

D.M.: Well, Roman Chapter 1 describes this in great detail. They rejected, refused to acknowledge him as God.

D.M.: Uh-huh.

F.P.: You know

D.M.: [chuckle] Oh

F.P.: --How old are you?

D.M.: I am 26

F.P.: Well

D.M.: I'm going to school at..uh..its a community college in New Bern

F.P.: OK

D.M.: Well, adulterers, and murderers. I'm not sure if you would interpret this as true, but could you comment on that?

F.P.: ...Whats that again? Tax cheaters?

D.M.: Well, murderers...

F.P.: ...Well, there. First thing is we do indeed preach to...uh...we have signs that say “Divorce = Adultery” and we have signs about abortion, which certainly is the main fashion of killing in this nation anymore. Tens of thousands of babies killed every year so we do indeed press those issues but that leads me to my second point I would make on this is...we don’t control the media. The media has been pushing this fag filth for several decades. They are the ones who have pushed this onto the front pages of the nation's newspapers and the lead stories on the 6 o’clock news and the national news...this homosexual relentless **** beatings that’s bound resulting in same sex marriage across the nation so that’s the part of our ministry that seems to get most of the media attention as that’s part of their agenda. So that would be my second major point.

D.M.: OK, immediate and distant...uh...children and adults alike, this is correct, right?

F.P.: Well, marriage or otherwise.

D.M.: Alright,who are under the age of 18,...essentially...came out and announced they were homosexual. What would be the church's opinion on...the decidings[sic] of the individual?

F.P.: Well

D.M.: Well, I'm trying to find--[crosstalk]

F.P.: If they were not a member

D.M.: What I'm really trying to find out with this question is...you know..obviously this child would not be able to legally leave...or become emancipated. I'm trying to find if the church would..i mean..place the child up for adoption? Or if the church would--

F.P.: --[chuckle] No

D.M.: Well, but I'm trying to find out if someone in the church wasn’t “up” with someone else in the church, in this case a child, would this child have to leave?

F.P.: No

D.M.: Well, I'd like to say if you're not too busy, if you have anything you'd like to add...I mean, the floor is entirely open to you. As I said, I will be transcribing this and I will be presenting this to the classroom so...eyes will be seeing this so if there's anything you'd like to add please feel free to say anything you like.

F.P.: Well

D.M.: Well

F.P.: Right, that’s “one-nine-five-five”, and...you know I've appreciated the opportunity to respond to your questions and I hope it helps you and anyone else who hears it

D.M.: Yes sir

F.P.: OK

D.M.: Thank you very much

F.P.: OK

D.M.: Bye.

Often times when I browse reddit, is from people who feel the need to apologize for their faith. The second is from people complaining that atheists are picking on them. Occasionally, someone will come in and attempt to save the day with a wonderful apologetic discourse.

Stop

First and foremost, and regardless of their past. When someone needs help, help them. If you see someone who is hungry, feed them. If you see someone who is hurting, hug them. Show people love with no ulterior motive other than your desire to love on them. Some of these people will ask you why. Why are you helping someone like me? When you answer that you do this because God loves me, even though I don't deserve it, they will respond in a way that lets you know their hearts are ready for the Gospel or they won't. Either way

Secondly, and people will ask you why and the response is exactly the same as above.

Winning souls is not about being knowing the Bible from beginning to end

I'm a pretty regular contributor here.  I am at a broken, advice, condemnation, something.  I can't process my thoughts right now.

My wife and I have had problems with our sex life since we were married.  She suffers from vaginismus but is too ashamed and embarrassed and scared to seek help.  She flatly refuses.  We have sex about 3 times per year.  We've somehow had 2 children within our 3 years of marriage.  I was very sexually active in my past (before my wife).  I am the only person she has had sex with

What began as simple communication about church events with my assistant (my wife's best friend) somehow turned sexual.  I cut it off a few times

I am so stupid.  I felt like I deserved it

I am so terrified of what confessing this might cause.  Of course I'm terrified of being exposed as well.  Our church and our little community would likely collapse under the weight of what I've done.  I am a fool.  I am so broken.  I want to die.

More complex answer:  When one person says that another person is advocating a wrong position about an issue

1. The other person is wrong because they have less information than the first person.  - This is the least judgemental category, because we have far more information than them.  I have never met a creationist who was able to keep up with me once I start talking about molecular biological evidences for evolution; they generally get very upset and complain about me using big words.

2. Though they have the same or more information to base their conclusion on, that logic will not produce a coherent position which fits all of the data and meshes perfectly with the work of millions of other scientists.  So that leaves us with 3.

3. The other person is lying. - Finally, since only through conspiracy could science present such a unified front.

Now

1. That would mean that everyone in a field related to the age of the earth or the history of life on it (physics, geology, and countless other areas) is all a part of this conspiracy.

2. Since many of the people involved in this conspiracy aren't doing financially that well (you make far

3. Since the creationists insist that the truth is supported by the facts, they are leading people away from True Christianity.

4. As a result


Some people may say that I am misinterpreting creationism, they are more than happy to all but say it and let everyone who listens to them draw that conclusion.

This is just their message and why I hate it so much.  I'm not even going into other things, and the numerous other ways they hurt society (that would be a very long post indeed).

**1. – Separation of Church and State keeps the government out of our churches.**

**2. – Separation of Church and State keeps our schools concentrated on the right things.**

Better yet, train them on how to be a missionary cleverly disguised as a student in public school so that they can be a part of life transformation!

 

**3. – Separation of Church and State keeps ALL religion out of schools and government.**
Remember

**4. It’s not the governments job.**
The jobs of spiritual growth and evangelism are not in the realm of the governments responsibility. Jesus never uses government to push his agenda. The Christian life is a life of personal impact, healing broken people. The church cannot use unchristian government as an excuse to not follow in the footsteps of Jesus. It is not the presidents job, or the job of congress, or any other person in political power to advance the gospel – it’s yours and it’s mine and if we fail in that and then blame it on the government, shame on us!""

During this week he suggested that we not allow such topics to pervade our subreddit and see if doing so results in a level of discussion that our community finds more satisfying.  We’ve discussed the idea and have decided that next week beginning on Monday (14 May)

We are calling this initiative **”Don’t Beat a Dead Horse – Give a Live Cow!”**

**For eight days – Monday the 14th through Monday the 21st – we will be collecting money to [donate livestock to families in impoverished nations](http://www.worldvision.org/worldvision/eappeal.nsf/egiftgc_cow?OpenForm)**.  It takes $500 to purchase a single dairy-producing cow for a family in a third-world country.  Such a gift not only affords a family the nutritional benefits of the cow’s milk; excess dairy products can also be sold for a second source of income.  Our goal here on /r/Christianity is to raise enough money to buy ten of these cows.  That means we're attempting to raise $5

- Creationism

- “Honest Questions from Atheists”

- Old Testament Laws

We will be dealing with these on a case-by-case basis: those truly soliciting Christian counsel will not be tagged as Dead Horse Topics while similar DHTs not specifically mentioned above may be.

This is an attempt to urge our community to consider the more meaningful topics than what often make the front page.  By turning our minds away from the things that divide us

1374355488.0,1iprmp,Satanist or Christian?,PetrineCross,361,99,185,"Anton LaVey, a Satanist worships themself as their own god. Satanists work magic rituals through which they attempt to gain things like wealth, it might very well be something like ""Make me rich

It occurs to me that most Christians these days, please give me the job I want, the car I want, the love life I want. Please give give give to me me me."" Or, they might pray something like this: ""God, please make this church great and successful in Jesus name. Please cause lots of people to donate and let us increase in members. Please give give give to us us us us us.""

The prayers aren't very different, Christians who pray like this would pretty much be Satanists! Even the Christian Bible seems to agree, with Jesus accusing the Pharisees of being ""white-washed tombs"" because, even though they had the appearance of being holy, they were only in it for themselves. They desired the ""high seats"" and ""being called Rabbi""; for them it was all about ""me me me"". This is very strange, considering that Christianity and Satanism should be polar opposites. Let's compare this though to some of the prayers of Jesus: we read that he prayed ""Give us the bread we need for each day, forgive us our sins as we forgive others""; it is never recorded that he particularly prayed for wealth or things of that sort, shortly before his crucifixion, but not my will

Have you spotted the vital difference between the prayers of Christ and these others I mentioned? Christ effectively said to God: if it is your will for me to suffer, it never was. It is about what YOU can do for Him.

So how do you pray? Do you pray ""Me me me me me"" like the Satanist? Do you pray ""us us us us us"" like the common church-going Christian, God, but YOU"" like Jesus did? Are you willing to say to God: ""Here is the job I want, and here is the car I want, here is the wealth, or the love life,or the success, or whatever it is that I deeply desire, like Christ being crucified, I only pray that your will be done in this world

In the Old Testament a good man utters a prayer to God, lest I steal and disgrace thy name. Only give me enough, that I may serve thee as I ought."" Like Christ, his concern is not for himself, but for God. If he thought he could best serve God poor, he would have prayed ""God, make me poor!"" I wonder how many Christians have prayed to be made poor

Christians- stop praying for yourselves only! Stop praying for the things *you* want! Stop putting priority on the job, the donations, the social life; let the world seek after these, but as Christians you are called to put God above all. If there is even one thing you are unwilling to give up for God, then that is lukewarmness. You cannot hope to enter a deeper spiritual life.

I will also warn you of this: the blood of Christ is not a free ticket out of being judged for your actions. Christ died so that we could receive forgiveness of sins when we **repent** of them, and are intent on never commiting them again. But if you want to say ""Christ already died for me"" as an excuse to live however you want, then I tell you now there is no forgiveness. None.

As Christians you are not free from judgement; on the contrary your judgement increases because you have the light: more is expected of you. ""You must be better than the Pharisees if you want to enter the kingdom of heaven"".
On God's day of judgement, and yet did nothing for my name except what would also benefit yourselves? You are worse than the sinners who never called themselves Christians to begin with.""

Is this you? Are you more concerned about your happy, but would God rather you gave those donations of 10% to a rich church or to the homeless on the street? Would God rather you sung hymns and read Bible verses and hung out with your church-friends on Sundays or that you spend private time alone with him, in solemn prayer? Have you even bothered to ask? If you haven't even bothered to ask, then have you really been living rightly up to now? Have you really been praying in a way and going about your life in a way that pleases God? It's up to you to discover the answer to these and no man can do it for you: it's up to YOU, to pray right NOW, ""God, if I have sinned

The main point I want to get across is this: ""The one who gives up his life will find true life, it is a sure sign that maybe you have placed too much value on worldly things, and too little value on God.

I am convinced that the Holy Spirit drew each and every one of us here for a reason - for some, it's just to lurk and read, or to leave a comment now and again. For others, He brought our unique gifts and our desire to serve here so that we could meet the needs of a lost world.

Let me throw out a figure.  If each of us gave fifteen cents a day to such an organization - about fifty-five bucks a year - we would raise 1.8 million dollars a year.  Now, fifty-five bucks a year won't be the threshold.  Some of us could pledge that much a month.  Heck, some of us could give five hundred bucks a month.  And those who can only offer fifteen cents - think of how God would multiply those gifts!

One small commitment.  Fifteen cents a day from each of us.  1.8 million dollars a year for the needy.

Hi guys

You see, can't keep a job, you get the general idea. Well, he came over to visit during the holidays, and he and my mother got into a massive fight. Inside my house. In front of my kids. I stepped between the two and told them both to either cut it out, or leave. My mother screamed at me for a bit about how unChristianlike I was, and then stormed out. She didn't speak to me for days, and how I wasn't ""following the Bible on respecting your parents"". I got to hear the lovely 'vulture verse' about it as well. 

Eventually, until she could be respectful towards us. 

You can imagine how that went. If not

After everyone cooled their tempers a bit...I mediated a meetup between my husband and my mother...and the talk went pretty well. My husband explained to her that we were BOTH getting quite fed up with the constant belittlement that we were all going to Hell for this

To all of our surprise, all the secular stuff"". She then accused me of ""harassing her and trying to drag her down"". Her reason behind this was a comment I'd made once that if she'd just try an MMO out with us, she'd see it wasn't 'of the devil'. Apparently that has been a major fuel source for her increasing attacks on us. 

I tried to talk to her about it

In the end, and continued to do so, that I had no compunctions about contacting her pastor, and having him talk to her. 

She's respected the rules thus far, due to her raising me to believe it was pure witchcraft and satanism. I'm serious.) However...I simply told her to drop it, and asked if she needed to 'call back at another time'. She literally stopped midword....made some vague angry noises....and then dropped it.

So....maybe there's hope. Not that she'll ever believe we aren't on a path straight to the dark side

But...thank you guys. I really appreciated all the support from my last thread, and laying some ground rules, worked. I'm going to just continue to pray for her at this point, and try to respect her boundaries...and just see what happens. =)

It’s vitally important, becoming more understood), even though we have a convicted faith in what isn’t very observable or understood.
We are understanding more and more than emotions aren’t magical. They are our experiences of physiological activity in our bodies

We are also understanding more and more the absolutely pivotal role played by the neurotransmitter “dopamine.” Dopamine stimulation is like pattern recognition nitro — it’s all about hopeful expectations and deciphering patterns in service thereof.

* [Take a look at this 3 minute clip from neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvwcyIrYAwQ)

Dopamine underpins almost everything we consider entertaining and/or psychologically addictive: rhyming, hoarding, story twists, conspiracy theories, wonder/awe, mysteries, chord progressions (I-V-vi-IV is perhaps the most resonant progression ever for Western listeners because of its cyclical and dramatic rising and falling), watching sports

When something is wrong with your dopamine transmission, restless leg syndrome, and shaking when afraid are all related to dopamine deficiency or over-stimulation.

Chronic depression is a neurotransmitter problem, serotonin) issues. When the ability to create hopeful expectations is hobbled or killed, then everything turns hopeless. Our conscious brains *respond* to this crippling problem by dwelling on the unclaimable, like the nostalgic past, and concluding nonsensical or irrational conclusions, like that a future full of potential is actually bleak.

This isn’t something that you can “think your way out of.” You can “think your way **through** and **during**, or through natural remedial brain activity (which makes depression merely temporary for some people).

Persistent depression is a *chemical issue*

* We must avoid jumping to superstitious conclusions

* We must avoid treating all brain activity as a libertarian product of conscious will

* We must avoid pretending like the brain is magical and can reason itself out of various thoughts and behaviors

I can't help but feel attracted to Christianity but I also continue to see many problems with Christianity. The thing is

Here are some examples:

* **Evolution** happens. I'm talkin' at the macro level - speciation and everything. This is a fact. Yet the Bible outlines a 6 day creation. I'm aware that there are various interpretations of Genesis that might allow for the truth of macro-evolution. Maybe you guys have some recommended sources?

* **Patriarchy** appears to be reinforced by Christian doctrine. Many will say that women are equal to men, disciple, prophet, pastor, priest, what-have-you, then I see no reason why a woman cannot. I also feel that many of our tendencies, as well as the pressure women feel to be beautiful and nurturing

* **The Bible as infallible.** The Bible was written by men and is therefore fallible. Are there any Christian traditions that admit this?

What I'm looking for are resources. I would like to find Christian traditions that may be compatible with these viewpoints of mine. My only exposure to Christianity thus far would contradict these three beliefs.

So just always like to be appreciative. 



Secondly, mostly gray haired. I sadly won’t be able to be with them long since I’m leaving to move a long way off for a job in August. I looked into my options in the place I’m moving to and the same thing: mostly stagnant churches in this denomination I’ve chosen. So why did I? Why didn’t I go back to my Catholic past or join a thriving denomination? Well the main reason is that after a lot of prayer and study I just simply love Lutheranism. The confessions and the movements within it are deeply inspiring and intellectually rich. The Book of Concord, Neo-Lutheranism, Pietism, all of it. I’m just called by it and I find myself in agreement with it. I truly do. I find that when I want to read something theological I consistently am going back to Lutheranism. Also, my love of apostolic Christian unity may be deep but my spirit is calling me elsewhere and so I give it up to God. Like Luther at Worms: “I can do no other. God help me! Amen.” Also, my parents are coming back to Church again because of my reversion to Christianity



But most of all I’m not going to let the decline of mainline Protestantism scare me into doing something I don’t feel called to do. If I truly feel this is right for me then I should engage this church and work for change. Running away from a challenge isn’t my game. So many people I talk to in mainline denoms are saddened by the decline but few are those who will do anything to save it. To love something is to fight for it. Revival can happen. I’ve seen it. I believe it. We’ve got a lot of history to learn from. We just have to draw from it. From Presbyterian seminaries with brilliant Barth scholars to rich Lutheran choir tradition to Wesleyan holiness living. These are powerful wells from which to draw a renewal. 



Yes churches will shrink and yes we may feel trapped and pushed to irrelevancy but far be it for Christians of all people to get all hopeless. I am firm in the belief that the mainline denoms will survive. Somewhere in a Lutheran mission a woman with a smile and a cross on her neck will welcome a meth addict and bring blankets for him when he shakes in the night and screams the demons out of himself



And in all of this the mainline denoms will carry on preaching Word and Sacrament. The lost will know that the cross of Christ is theirs to claim. They’ll know that Jesus can pour out grace and free them from the bondage of sin. They’ll know that the saints will judge the world and that they too can be a saint.



So consider this not only a flair change but a word to all those dismayed that their traditions

I'm writing this because a lot of churches have Superbowl parties. A lot of Churches order pizza. 

I'm going to ask you to talk about this subject with whomever's ordering today. 

Now, displaying none of the Fruits of the Spirit that we are supposed to be showing to the world.

Consider these scriptures: 

* 1 Timothy 5:18 ESV For the Scripture says, “The laborer deserves his wages.”
* Leviticus 19:13 Do not defraud or rob your neighbor. ‘Do not hold back the wages of a hired worker overnight.
* There's more

(Full Disclosure: My husband is a pizza driver, but his is the only steady job between the two of us.)

Dine-in servers typically earn between $2.15-$3.15 an hour. Delivery drivers, much less wear and tear on the car. Drivers use their own car, pay for their own gas, maintenance and car insurance. 

*Your tips make a difference.* A slim day and a good day is the difference between paying a bill this month or digging change out of the couch to give to the gas station clerk. It's the difference between a decent week of meals with fresh fruits and veggies or ramen noodles every night. It makes a difference on whether we can pay anything but the car insurance bill or not. 

The drivers at my husband's workplace have plenty of stories about how the people with the ""JESUS IS THE REASON FOR THE SEASON"" lights in the front yard during Christmas are the people who give the 67 cent tip from the $19.33 order (or ask for the change back and give *no* tip). 

He's dropped off many $90+ deliveries to churches for parties and gotten *stiffed.* No tip. A few times he made two trips for very large orders

Please talk about this situation with your pastors and fellow church members. 

Every time a person with a cross around their neck or a crucifix on the wall shuts the door

I understand that some folks don't know tip etiquette. We can fix that. [This website here, we teach.

Before my parents divorced, I opened up that Bible to a random page, and it landed on Psalms 77, which just so happened to be circled in blue ink. Knowing that this chapter had impacted my dad at one point, I read it over.

&gt; I cried out to God for help;
    I cried out to God to hear me.
 When I was in distress
    at night I stretched out untiring hands
    and I would not be comforted.
 I remembered you
    I meditated
 You kept my eyes from closing;
    I was too troubled to speak. 
 I thought about the former days
    the years of long ago;
 I remembered my songs in the night.
    My heart meditated and my spirit asked:
 “Will the Lord reject forever? 
    Will he never show his favor again?
 Has his unfailing love vanished forever?
    Has his promise failed for all time?
 Has God forgotten to be merciful? 
    Has he in anger withheld his compassion? ”
 Then I thought
    the years when the Most High stretched out his right hand. 
 I will remember the deeds of the Lord;
    yes
 I will consider all your works
    and meditate on all your mighty deeds.”
 Your ways
    What god is as great as our God? 
 You are the God who performs miracles; 
    you display your power among the peoples.
 With your mighty arm you redeemed your people
    the descendants of Jacob and Joseph.
 The waters saw you
    the waters saw you and writhed; 
    the very depths were convulsed.
 The clouds poured down water
    the heavens resounded with thunder; 
    your arrows flashed back and forth.
 Your thunder was heard in the whirlwind
    your lightning lit up the world;
    the earth trembled and quaked. 
 Your path led through the sea
    your way through the mighty waters
    though your footprints were not seen.
 You led your people like a flock 
    by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

1322757769.0,mw9q3,Moderator Message: How Much Moderation Does the Community Want?,keatsandyeats,279,72,318,"**Please upvote this so it gets read - I won't get any karma from it.**

Although it takes many forms, what level of moderation is necessary to maintain the kind of community that we want.  The discussion has ranged from [accusations that we censor and ban indiscriminately](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/fy941/an_open_letter_to_rchristianity_and_its/) to the recent post prompting this message that asked if our sub [has ""morphed into /r/DebateAChristian""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/mtfs7/well_i_guess_rchristianity_has_basically_morphed/).

A brief history on the subject is in order since Reddit's collective memory rivals Reagan's

- Two years ago smacfarl [tried to address the problem](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/90e4i/from_the_moderator_this_is_not_a_playground_for/) of this sub becoming a ""playground for atheistic evangelism.""  

- Our [Community Policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianityPolicy/comments/cixs8/community_policy_for_rchristianity/) was developed to clarify some of the behaviors that result in moderator intervention.  

- When the arguments got out of control

- We were subsequently, each when when we only attempted to follow the Community Policy.

- Last month

The long version involves headhunts, spin-off subs attempting to build atheist-free communities.  Nevertheless, we have consistently taken a middle approach to moderation: **we only step in when downvotes are not effectively regulating negative content**.  The best defense against trolls is to downvote them and ignore them while upvoting good content.  (This doesn't always work - today's popular [Darrin Rasberry post demonstrates](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/mw1lb/darrin_rasberry_former_contributor_to_debunking/) that there are plenty of lurking atheists *and* Christians who will simply downvote an opinion that opposes their own.)

So far we've found that Reddit simply lacks the structure for a rigid set of guidelines to be helpful.  For instance, so we have to deal with them on a case-by-case basis.  It's the Wild West with the exception that in the Wild West, you can put a repeat offender in jail; here, the worst you can do is ban *one account*, and there's nothing stopping an angry Redditor from making a dozen puppet accounts and continuing to troll.

Bearing all of the above in mind

**How much moderation do you really want?**

Are there behaviors that we can more effectively curb?  What role do you want us to play in regulating comments or content?  Do you have suggestions for rules that are not in place but you feel are necessary?  Please discuss below; we will read all the comments, maybe it'll come to a vote or something.  For what it's worth, this community belongs to you.  We're only your servants.  We are prepared to do whatever needs to be done for you to feel that you maintain ownership of the community.

1368454089.0,1e8t8q,Theology AMA - Calvinism,tphelan88,244,44,1381,"Good morning brothers and sisters.  Today is the Calvinism edition of the Theology AMA series!  /u/rev_run_d

Calvinism is a theology based on the teachings of John Calvin (1509-1564), and John Wycliffe, Calvin believed that the Roman Catholic Church had become corrupt and had departed from Biblical truth.  A follower of the Augustinian tradition, Calvin expounded on the topics of predestination and the absolute sovereignty of God in salvation.  Calvin’s most famous work is *Institutes of the Christian Religion*. 

In the first decade of the 1600’s a controversy arose in the Dutch Reformed Church over a theologian named Jacob Arminius who opposed many of Calvin’s doctrines.  Those who followed Arminius (known as Arminians) had produced a list of objections against the Calvinist doctrines which were called The Remonstrance of 1610.  In 1618 a council was formed in the city of Dordrecht, known as the Canons of Dort which is summarized by the Acronym TULIP, commonly known as the Five Points of Calvinism. The Five Points are as follows:  1) Total Depravity 2) Unconditional Election 3) Limited Atonement 4) Irresistible Grace 5) Perseverance of the Saints.

The so-called Five Points became the central doctrines of what we today know as Calvinism.  The Reformed Church and Presbyterians are the two major subscribers to Calvinistic theology.  Many other Baptist denominations and non-denominational churches also adopted Calvinistic theology.

The following is a brief outline of the Five Points

**Total Depravity** – or Radical Depravity, 6:6).  People by nature are not inclined to love God, but instead follow their own interests and to reject the rule of God and are by nature objects of God’s wrath (Ephesians 2:1-3).  This radical depravity affects every aspect of one’s being, making it impossible for man, in his natural faculties, choose to follow God and to redeem himself.  Our every thought, word, making even our good deeds as filthy rags before God’s holiness (Isaiah 64:6).  Any impetus to awaken a spiritually dead sinner must therefore come from God.

**Unconditional Election** – God has chosen from eternity past those whom He will bring to Himself, or faith in these people; rather, His choice is unconditionally grounded in His mercy alone (Ephesians 1:5,6).  Those not chosen receive the just wrath that is warranted for their sins.  Free will is still affirmed. There is seen to be no contradiction between free will and unconditional election. We have free wills, but we did not choose our will; it was given to us. So, while we choose whatever we wish under no intervention or compulsion outside ourselves (free will), God, has still set the end from the beginning.

**Limited Atonement** – Or “Particular Atonement/Definite Atonement” asserts that Jesus’ substitutionary atonement was definite and certain in its purpose and in what it accomplished.  Only the sins of the elect were atoned for by Jesus’ death.  This is not to say that the atonement is limited in value or power

**Irresistible Grace** – The saving grace of God is effectually applied to those whom God has determined to be saved (the elect) and overcomes their resistance to obeying the call of the gospel

**Perseverance of the Saints** – Since God is sovereign and His purposes and will cannot be overthrown or frustrated by humans or any other power (Romans 8:31-39) those who fall away from faith either never had true saving faith or will one day return of God’s flock.

**TL;DR**  We're Calvinists

A few things you should be aware of

 * [**We are a moderated community.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/XtianityPolicy/comments/nw0w4/community_policy_last_update_12032010/) As a community that represents a minority position on Reddit

 * [**We have a FAQ!**](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/christianity) A lot of questions get asked ad nauseum. While not perfect, and better prepare you for interaction with the regular users here. It's fine to ask a question addressed in the FAQ, but it's helpful if you at least check to see what's offered there first.

 * [**Please search before asking a question.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/search?q=&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance) We get questions about gay marriage, the epicurean paradox, and the Old Testament weekly. Sometimes daily. If you can find a recent discussion, it's always better to join that discussion than to start a new one.

 * [**Please use descriptive titles in your posts.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/o6c3m/an_honest_request_from_an_honest_moderator_to_all/) This just ensures that submissions are searchable. Instead of posting ""I have an honest question for the Christians here..."", ""If God doesn't desire that anyone should go to hell (2 Peter 3:9), and is all powerful, how could you believe that anyone goes to hell?"" The last option is much more searchable.

 * [**Our flair system is a little different.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/jugnq/user_flair_automation/) Follow [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/jugnq/user_flair_automation/) link if you want to set your flair. The scarlet ""A"" was chosen by atheists on /r/Christianity and is not meant to be negative commentary on the atheists in our community (once in a while we get people misunderstanding this).

Until it joins some larger way
Where many paths and errands meet.
And whither then? I cannot say”

My husband and I both went to the same Baptist private school as children. My mom is AoG and my dad is more of a Christian Universalist. I was also involved in a campus student ministry in college that really focuses on evangelizing to non-believers. Apart from going to school, we both felt like we were Christians

Well, I realize from the start how out of place I was. I was the only female in the building wearing jeans. I wasn't dressed sloppily or anything, but I was wearing pants, and that got me some glances. The speaker was a wiry, sensationalist little man. He looked maybe in his thirties but spoke like one of those old, impassioned hell-fire and brimstone types. I remember one of the things he mentioned was praying for someone who had died recently, because even though he had accepted Christ on his deathbed

After the sermon, but I just smiled and nodded because they were trying to be friendly. 

We went over to my husband's friend's house after church. There were a few other couples there apart from us and we had a decent enough time, the ultimate authority of their CoC interpretation of the Bible, etc. I really had a problem with how they believed that their interpretation was the only correct interpretation of the Bible and that all other denominations got it wrong and weren't Christians because they weren't following the Bible exactly. They also talked about how you can't question those beliefs since doing so would be to question God and therefore would make you not a Christian. I got really uncomfortable and finally all of my poking and prodding at my husband underneath the table got his attention that I wanted to go. So, we finally left. That was truly one of the most awkward moments of my life. We both felt strange afterwards and his friend kept sending him DVDs in the mail and inviting him to these gospel meetings, but we never went and we eventually lost contact.

This really made me upset about what we so often times do to non-believers (whoever they might be to us). We get to know them and befriend them in hopes of ""turning them to our side."" Or at least

Anyone else have any experiences of having someone trying to convert you that you found shocking? (I'm not talking about Mormons coming to your door. I think everyone alive has been through that. I mean something rather unexpected.)

I'm purposfully not commenting because this is a time for me in which I'm more interested in listening and hearing than repeating back the same things I'm said all my life. 

Edit 1: Update (01/04/12

I'd like to make a few clarifications and comments:

Clarifications:

(1) Some people thought this was either a troll or way to farm material for an article; it is not. I've sought this sub-Reddit's opinions from the heart.

(2) I've read every single comment in this post

(3) I've upvoted replies with thought out and good intended advice; I haven't downvoted anyone

(4) My spell-check isn't working

Comments:

(1) Thank you so much to everyone for responding to this post; I've gotten mounds of advice and reading material. It's extremely appreciated. I will definately check out the articles and books provided to me (With my main source bring the Bible).

(2) Some people are still stuck on my attraction to the same sex being a choice. That's your opinion but it's my opinion that you're wrong. If you're interested in getting to know the lgbtq crowd a bit in conversation

(3) Ex-gay therapy is just not something that I believe in, but that's my opinion. 

**Conclusion:**

**Here's what I got out of this experience. I'm a person of Christ who happens to be attracted to men. This doesn't define me as a person. Focusing on this one aspect of me and not my relationship with God

**I do not for a second believe that this one part of me is a choice, no matter what it is in the political sphere. The action of homosexuality is considered a sin within the Word, so I must refrain from it. You can't continually live a life of sins and then just think it's forgiven because you ask for it. You have to truely repent with your heart. How can you truely repent for something that you meant to do? You just can't.** 

**What I need to do now is stop thinking about personal relationships and start developing a closer relationship to the Lord and His Word. I need to listen to Him and grow as a child of Christ. The fact that I'm gay is not pertinant to my relationship with God. I need to stop saying ""I'm a gay Christian."" It would be like saying

**Celibacy seems like the only option

**I'll study the Word of the Lord, live as the Lord asks, make mistakes in the eyes of the Lord, and ask for forgiveness from the Lord, recieve forgiveness if the Lord wills it. Every other aspect of my life comes with that.**

**I'm not going to constantly focus on ""you're gay,"" I'm going to focus on creating a stronger bond with the Lord and living a life that pleases Him with Him by my side, every step of the way.**

(Throwaway)

I am a gay person

I've heard plenty of versions of how I should live: some mention celibacy

It's ultimately a deeply personal choice of what I choose

It should be mentioned that I'm looking for a Christian opinion on this as well. As a member of thus sub-Reddit on another account

Lastly, etc. I don't exclude them from anything, I don't tell them I think they're failures, and they do the same to me. I respect their right to not believe and we move on in life. They know I am a Christian and they know I'd gladly talk to them about salvation at ANY point. Don't come in here telling me about judging people and excluding people. 

Please, for sure. They can critique, deny, even debate it. That's helpful and keeps us from being close-minded.

I have been thinking a lot about this over the past few weeks

So here's the deal.  I love Reddit, and amusing content.  However, regardless of what may be true in the broader cultures we live in, practicing Christians are a minority here on Reddit.

Regardless of your belief on whether or not Christianity as a whole is valuable for society, but WAS inspired by Christ's teachings).

However

I know that many of you think that we would all be better off if we gave up Christianity altogether.  Speaking for myself

Some of you have asked us as Christians to fight the propagation of these false and harmful beliefs.  I am dedicated to doing so

We need a place where we can discuss Christian ideas and beliefs from a Christian perspective without the need to formally prove God's existence in every thread.  Arguments from an atheistic perspective will have very little effect in persuading misguided Christians to change their harmful beliefs, just like food lovers in r/food, fitness lovers in r/fitness, and weed lovers in r/trees.

And in general, and I agree, but surely you can understand if that's not what really what we want to do 24/7.  Most professional athletes, or gamers, or chess players are happy for a challenge, but sometimes they don't want a battle, they just want to eat a burger, or discuss literature in a non-contentious environment.

So, how can we do it?  If not, why not?  Thoughts?

I am falling from my faith. These are 15 of my issues I've been having. I hope you take time to read this and answer thoroughly so as to help me turn back to Jesus. I honestly do want to keep my relationship with him, don't give me an empty answer.


1. Why did God create Hell? At first, he created Satan and he even knew before he rebelled that Lucifer would.
And yet, from an eternity in Hell, the eternal torture chamber he created specifically for the purpose of torturing his own children. I have two points to make about that. First, I can think of nobody, not a single person, who has done or COULD EVER do anything to deserve an eternity in such a place, especially not if they were my children and especially not if it was forever. My second point is he created us with the tendency towards evil, I wouldn't have a kid. Especially not trillions of them.
He created us for the single purpose of worshipping him; was our devoted, to an eternity in Hell?

2. If it was always God's plan to provide Salvation through Jesus

3. What is the soul?

4. Why did God have to send Jesus? He's God. Couldn't he just forgive us? Sending his son to die seems dramatic considering he's God. He instead decided to kill his only son.

5. Why does God allow for hurt and sadness? And don't just say 'you can't know happiness without sadness

6. Why did God create evil?

7. When God wanted to destroy Sodom, but you can have my virgin daughters."" This isn't acceptable in society today, but this was the action that presented him as righteous in God's eyes. Also, back during those times you could have slaves, give daughters in trade for goats, having sex with young girls, and a lot more that isn't acceptable today. How come, morals can't change now for things like gay marriage

8. About Job, and also his wife, while causing him illness, material loss, and depression. Also: How could Satan stand in the presence of God when he is pure evil, if God couldn't even look at his own son when he had sin on him?

9. What did Jesus sacrifice? His life? No, many have suffered worse or caused worse deaths in his name. Did he not deserve it because he was sinless? That can't be it either because infants die who are sinless as well. So what did he REALLY sacrifice?

10. Is there free-will in Heaven? And if so

11. Why did all these other religions get started, healings, etc.)

12. What historical/archeological evidence is there to prove that the events in the bible happened? (Ex. The flood, etc)

13. Are we supposed to get our morals strictly from the bible without influence from the world? What about on things like Slavery? Stoning of gays? Treatment of widows? Women's rights?

14. Why did Jesus die? As in

15. Why hasn't he come yet? (Matthew 16:28, etc)


These 15 things are just some of the many reasons I am struggling with the reality of it. Honestly, I believe a God who claims to be so loving and just would take me back.

I've prayed so much.  I trust God.  I have seen so many small signs that that help is on the way.  I found out yesterday that two of my really good friends were Christian.  I did not know this and it was very comforting to know that I walked with Christian brothers.  

Despite everything though it gets closer and closer to brink of it all.  The absolute abyss of of failure and hopelessness.  I don't even feel like I'm at the ledge anymore but rather leaning over it.  

I just want God to tell me what to do.  Doubts are beginning to cloud my mind

I don't know what to do. 

I've suffered from anxiety for the past 7 weeks.  Now I honestly feel like I may be sinking into depression.  I'm losing hope.  It's hard to keep faith when you're entire family is about to broke and homeless with my father in prison.  

*Things just happened so fast.  Everything in life went wrong in a week. And it's been snowballing ever since.  I just need more strength to continue.  It's very hard to move on anymore.  I'm feeling a stronger desire everyday to sleep more.*

(I am not suicidal). 

Update: I want to thank everyone so much for their offer of assistance. But I am just a student in college. The worst that can happen to me is that I sleep on couches and that I steal food from the cafeteria. My family life back home however is the real wreck

Plus I know how much trust is so important in this world. My life was ruined because someone broke my trust in them and they took away everything from me

I have enough food to last me a week and about $200 left on my credit card which is sustaining me at the moment until my bill is due. 

I just wish there was a way that I could accept help and somehow find a way to pay you guys back. I feel like the kindness of Reddit and this community has been abused so much. I want to remove doubt from everyone's mind that I could be such an abuser. 

I'm not sure what to do. Maybe God is giving me this message and I am simply meant to pay it forward. ",,t5_2qh6c,1365550029.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1bz0v3/i_am_a_former_atheist_now_reconverted_back_to/

I used to attend Sunday school and services almost weekly with my grandparents. But for reasons that are beyond me


 Fast forward a little bit into me starting college. I have no shame admitting that I did my fair share of dangerous and stupid things that should have killed me because it is what put me here today. but because I was so naive I got pulled out of college for grades and just all around poor decisions. So I left college to return to my fathers house under his roof, and it all started to get to me and i wondered if I would ever have a happy life that could contribute something to this world. I began taking classes again at a local community college but my thinking continued to get darker and darker to the point i thought i would be doing everyone in my life a favor if i just killed myself so I wouldn't burden anyone anymore. And these past four days were very tough for me to get through.


 But last night I was looking though some old things and I came across my old bible and more specifically I came across a verse my church's pastor had highlighted for me and that verse was Matthew 6:34 ""take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."" and as soon as I read it to myself I began to cry and this feeling of hope and love rushed through my body , and smiling the most I have in years. It was truly a beautiful moment for me. I feel like a new man! I am happy with myself again! And this day I have decided to start reading the Bible again and soon start attending services.


 I apologize if my writing is off or confusing I just really had to share my story and what happened because it is the most beautiful thing that has ever happened to me.

One of the hardest sin I have overcome is fornication. I am 22 and just out of college and while I have always been a christian since I was child

It was my first extended time away from family and friends, and while I was a virgin, a hot girl and too much to drink lead me to having sex. I didn't feel guilt, or bad, but it opened the door to it happening more and more.

I prayed about it and asked God why I was having such a hard time with this sin. With thinking so little of this women that I would have sex with them without knowing the names and without ever seeing them after the next morning

The event that truly opened my eyes to this was a girl I hooked up with. To be more accurate, and after a little making out, she got up and said, ""I know you are better than this."" and left.

I chased her to the hallway and called to her

I didn't give it much thought as it was a few weeks to Christmas and break was coming up and not every situation works out. On break, let me introduce you to my roommate from out of state. The girl gets up from the seat in front of us (she was facing away from us all the time) and who do you know it is, but the girl that left.

I am floored

Three weeks later back at school I get a letter in the mail (of all things) it is from the girl and she explains that my friend knows nothing about the night at the bar and her apartment

She felt that if I was faced with my sin in the way she handled it

We never dated or anything but she is now one of my best friends. The Lord will always find a way to help lead us back to Him.

But as I grew older in High School I started to question a bit about the few things in life I couldn't answer with my usual science approach. And when I got to college my very closest friend started to show me the better parts of religion. Where it can teach us about love and accepting each other for who we are and not living a cold hateful world that I used to. Also I hit a low point during the semester and all she could tell me is how much faith she had in me that I would get better. And the idea of faith was baffling to me. It was such a strong feeling that helped me so much in my hard times. Well now I'm done with the soliloquy

The guy didn't appear homeless. If he hadn't said something, but his car had broken down. He lives in a city about an hour away and his friends all got home through various family members, but he was stuck. Among other things, he was in town to see his son who has Autism Spectrum Disorder, but was totally out of money.

Anyway, he said he couldn't believe my generosity. I told him that I was just praying to be able to do something nice for somebody. 

He then quoted Romans 8:28 to me from memory: ""And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him

I bought him a ticket on my phone for 8:30 tonight. He asked me if I would take him to get a razor so that he could get a clean shave before going to see his son. I said of course

It's amazing what God does through us and for us

EDIT: This is a true story. I am not a troll. Somebody else re-posted to r/atheism under a different name and I guess also said some terribly racist things.

I'm sorry that some of you feel like cynicism is the best response to a witness to God working in the world. Could it have been a scam? I guess so. But there's a large homeless population where I live, his son, and Autism Spectrum Disorder, the practical details of which he was very familiar (as am I somewhat).

Hebrews 6:10. God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them.

And like many other men

Honestly, I knew that not to be true. 
I knew deep down inside that the reason this whole issue had sprung up was because I was incredibly lonely. I had been used and abused by countless amounts of people after offering them my aid for so long; and after all was said and done I believed I deserved something.

That's when my sin would kick in. I would fantasize, that I was allowed to sin because I had done more than what was expected of me. 
I knew, but I couldn't, and I knew that if this issue wasn't taken care of soon it would turn into something worse than it already was.


So, when I suddenly get that urge to fulfill a sexual sin, I will look for something to do around the house. Whether it is cleaning, making my meal for work or doing laundry doesn't matter, what matters is that it occupies my mind long enough to direct the energy of that urge somewhere else.

When browsing through r/Christianity, as Christians, view the world (and back it Biblically).  Rather than being like r/atheism, and posting memes and FB posts of how ""dumb"" Christians are, we focus on building each other up. (YES, I understand r/atheism is an outlet for people to express their feelings because we live in a world were atheist is downcast and persecuted for thinking freely, and I believe a place like that is needed. My best friend is atheist and we have amazing conversations where we jar each others minds).  

Just as a whole

To me this seems to be the perfect example of how Christians should react to anyone we know involved in sin - including homosexuality.  Jesus steps in to advocate for her, he saves her, but he does say ""go and sin no more"".  

I think a lot of times the popular liberal approach of this community is to do the first parts of Jesus's reaction but leave out the end line.  Yes, and unwavering!  We are to model that.  We are to be a peculiar people (1 Peter 2:9).  We are not supposed to be like the crowd.

It became such a feat I just wanted to give up and let it be the sin that will just hold me down until the day I die... Yet the conviction never stopped so there was always a truth I knew I haven't faced yet. A truth telling me that it WAS possible. Okay so it was possible... But my viewpoint was that it was wayy too hard for ME to overcome. Maybe some men are just built with a stronger will than me because this isn't something I am capable of overcoming (I was just living in defeat constantly..)

I could go for a few days with sexual purity but I always found a way to let myself fail.... That was until I found the source of where I had it wrong. My heart. 


 ""Above all else

A pure heart will give you clean hands. So.. once I let this truth sink deep within me

""Create in me a pure heart

You need to pray for this and then believe God WILL do it. Do it now. Then continue reading...


The trick here on out is not giving yourself any opportunity to possibly fail... Don't trick yourself into going deeper down the rabbit hole once the temptation starts. I think we all know how we end up in situations where we don't want to be in... Its by little yeses. A little yes here and a little yes there will lead you in a place where you will eventually regret. Remember

Do you really want to have this sexual thought? NO. Do you really want to look at her that way? NO. Do you really want to go to that website that may or may not tempt you more? HELL NO.

""Submit yourselves, and he will **flee** from **you**."" (James 4:7)

End the battle before it even begins. I am now months into living a sexually pure life and it truly hasn't been much of a struggle at all... I am aware of guarding my heart though and making sure it is in accordance to Gods will by talking to Him and reading the Word. Its pretty easy now...

---------

Disclaimer: This is a very very long post. But it serves a purpose. If you don’t want to read it all

So I went to a non-denominational mega church for Sunday worship this morning. It was quite an experience, and perhaps should be, but I welcome any comments and defenses.

---------

We parked and walked up onto quite a scene. It was a complex of large buildings connected by an open courtyard with very broad sidewalks and very expensive landscaping. There was a food trailer (very Austin…), refreshments, and had a full service kitchen. There was a building for “Kid’s Quest”. And then of course there was the sanctuary - excuse me - ‘auditorium’. I don’t remember seeing a single cross anywhere, and I couldn’t help but be reminded of Jesus turning over the moneychangers’ tables in the Temple (Matthew 21).

We walked into the auditorium a few minutes before the service started and there was techno blasting out of the P.A., which many people were using for their drinks and snacks. After the countdown ended, the lights changed and directed our attention to the worship band who proceeded to do a very impressive 10 minute Zepplin medley… This was apparently a special treat for all the dads for Father’s Day. Don’t get me wrong. I loooove Zepplin and they played very well. I gig in a hard rock band around Austin regularly. But at church on Sunday?... It was an instrumental and the lyrics were very conveniently omitted.

The pastor came out onto the stage and there was a series of gift card giveaways to the dad that had the youngest child, the band led the congregation in 2 Christian rock songs. Which was fine. Not really my scene. But the songs were definitely God-centered, and I can appreciate that. I didn’t know the music, and even though the words were projected onto the screens, I didn’t feel called to sing. Neither did most people. We were at a concert…

After the music, the sermon loosely focused around the theme word for the week - ‘tenacity’ - which I guess is what he took from that part of the parable. They played some clips from the movie Hot Rod that showed Andy Samberg failing every jump that he makes in the movie miserably. The pastor then went on for about 40 minutes talking about himself. Taking his kids to the park, his relationship with his wife, his relationship with his dad. To my memory, he never once referred back to the scripture verse or really engaged it directly at all. He did pull up a few verses that supported various parts of his ambiguous message. Fathers don’t be too harsh on your kids (Ephesians 6:4). Husbands love your wives (Ephesians 5:2). And then during the closing song, people started leaving to beat the traffic.

I left feeling very unchallenged and fairly concerned that this is what thousands

---------

Conclusions and Concerns:

1. This is so so so far removed from what the Apostles instituted as Christian worship. Church is not supposed to be for your entertainment. It’s supposed to be for your spiritual benefit. It's supposed to be a place where you can remove yourself from the world and focus on your relationship with God directly, they have embraced the world and invited it into their midst. Led Zepplin, Andy Samberg, movie theater seats, cup holders. Give me a freaking break. **You’re not supposed to observe, you’re supposed to participate. You’re not supposed to be entertained, you’re supposed to be admonished**

2. Church is supposed to be where followers of Christ are fed with the Word of God. Not given a glimpse into the life of the pastor and expected to take some vague principle or lesson from it to apply in their own life. The Bible is full of lessons from the Old Testament, the church organized what is called a **lectionary**, which provides a way to cycle through the scriptures without skipping anything you don’t want to talk about. This was a practice inherited from Judaism. Every day, there are pre-ordered readings from the Old Testament, the Gospel, and the Epistles. They often relate to each other extremely well. These verses are all read aloud in full. The pastor/priest is provided with rich source material on which to expound. His words are supposed to clarify and directly elaborate on the lesson (in full) in the scripture. **Not the other way around. He’s not supposed to articulate some vague story and use single out-of-context verses to validate his otherwise vacuous message**.

3. **THE EUCHARIST!!!**. Eucharist (and sometimes baptisms which were also accompanied with Eucharist) were the only reason members of the early church were ever all together in one place. I’m not going to go into real presence theology. If you don’t believe that Christ meant Eucharist (and baptism!) as more than a metaphorical exercise, or you don’t do it very often. I suggest you ask your pastor why. And listen to his answer very carefully.

**TL;DR... If you’ve found Christ in a place like this, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Methodist, Baptist, even a smaller non-denom church

Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. Resist him, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast. To him be the power for ever and ever. Amen.

Finally, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things. Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me—put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.


Hebrews 12:1-2 NIV


Therefore, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.


1 Peter 4:1-3 NIV


Therefore, because whoever suffers in the body is done with sin. As a result, they do not live the rest of their earthly lives for evil human desires, but rather for the will of God. For you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to do—living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies


Philippians 4:13 NIV


I can do all this through him who gives me strength.


Romans 12:1-2 NIV


Therefore, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship. Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.


Psalm 119:11


I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you.

**People’s faith (or lack thereof) informs their political beliefs in different ways and to different degrees.  This is a very real issue within the Christian community and warrants discussion.**

So let’s have those discussions.  But let’s do so with proper decorum and kind regard for our fellow brothers and sisters.  With this in mind

1.	Whereas many people hate the idea of Republican Jesus, and no political party has died for our sins.

2.	If you want to discuss politics, polls, and statistics.  This keeps the discussion on the issues and not on which participant is the best Christian.

3. Please don't generalize folks.  It's generally counter-productive to fruitful discussion.

4. One final note:  please respect reddiquette.  I realize that everyone will have different ideas about what contributes to discussion and what doesn’t

This was slightly over two years ago. I know that I definitely now believe in a God of some sort. What would your advice be? I have tried to forget about it all but I seem not to be able to forget how I felt. I'm not sure if what I heard at church is the same God I sort of acknowledge... I have no-one to talk to about this - the Christian friend I made is now no longer a friend (long

Any advice would be appreciated as I can't shake this feeling I had and I want to know if it was God... and if He won't let me forget it because he wants me to become a Christian/explore the bible at least... It bothers me a great deal. The main reason I'm so confused is because I really didn't like what I was being told at church yet at the same time I was feeling something so strong that it unsettled me. I'm 22 now so I've been struggling with this for years.

For the first time in years, the bible, and from the suggestions of other posters.


Yesterday, and it was so coincidental that the sermon was very much relate-able to the problems we were having in our relationship. Maybe it was God's plan? It was about how relationships, marriages are a huge deal and how we need to find the right person with the right values, the same values as us. How there will always be the high of highs and the lowest of lows.


After the sermon, ""thank you for coming with me, it means a lot to me"" and I said of course, I am happy to be here. And I truly was.

1349563176.0,1128iu,Wife Cheated. Please Help,tronkoop,216,61,213,"My wife and I met two years ago and got engaged last November.  We have always had a very loving relationship but at times it felt as though we were either madly in love or arguing. Most arguments always ended in laughter and laughter has always been a big part of our relationship. She has many insecurities and co-dependency issues but I always knew we could work on them through counseling and church which we have done some of.

6 months into dating we took a break for 5 days.  During that time she slept with two men and made out with one.  The one she kissed had always had a crush on her and I was always very wary of him but she assured me it was ok.  It took her 8 months and an extremely emotional conversation after we got back together to admit that she had done this.

1 month before the wedding I had a softball tournament on a weekend.  A few days before the tournament she got a late invitation to an out of town wedding of a mere acquaintance.  She begged me to go but I told her I had made a commitment but that she should go and have fun.  She became very upset and even threatened to call off the marriage.  I believed it was just one of her fits and that weekend we went to our separate events.  After the wedding she went to her sisters and made out with a man that had also admittedly had a crush on her whom I did not trust.  She told me immediately but backed it up with the fact that she believed the wedding was off

We were married July 6th of this year and 6 weeks later I fell asleep on the couch one night before she came home from work.  I woke up at 2 A.M. to find out she left a voicemail saying she ran into an old friend in town and they were going out for drinks ( high school boyfriend).  They stumbled in at 3 A.M. and she did not even bother to come upstairs to kiss me.  I found them lying on the couch, started bawling and admitted that the day I didn't talk to her, that night she went out with some friends and slept with a friends boyfriends friend.  She was really drunk and said she stopped it but my world crashed that day.  I kept asking why why why and hung up saying I never wanted to see her again.  

I contacted her 2 days later and the following day I went back to our apartment.  We talked it over and I said we will work at it but things needed a drastic change.  While making dinner I asked if that was all that happened and again more tears and hysteria.  She said that the night I told her I never wanted to see her again, and made out with a client of hers she saw there.  I again left feeling even more broken.

For a few weeks after that I continued a pattern of going back

For the past few weeks I have been getting my side of the divorce papers signed, and just the general nonsense that goes along with this situation.  Finally after weeks of trying she agreed for a time to sign her half but wouldn't have them notarized that day because she was too busy.  The next day she called crying and told me we need to talk and that she had some things she had to tell me.  I went to our apartment and waited for her to get off work.  I went on the computer and clicked on the facebook tab.  It opened up to her page (promise I wasn't snooping, I dont even know her password).  Open on the page was a chat session with a different client of hers (7 years older, 2 kids, and currently going through his own divorce for cheating on his wife).  They had apparently been talking for the couple weeks after I left.  Discussions about how excited they were to see each other on different nights, discussing plans about a trip they are on right now, and just horrible things.  He had been sleeping in my bed, with my wife

Her parents have disowned her and have kept in contact with me making sure I am ok and explained that they always knew of her problems and that they needed to be dealt with but never thought they could manifest to this.  I have since been trying to get her to notarize her side but she keeps canceling appointments last second with the lawyers when I am sitting there (3 times, texts, phone calls, and I just cant get her to take 5 minutes to sign these documents.

I still some days love and miss her but I don't know how to ever forgive her.  Is there a reason these papers aren't signed?  Is this a sign?  I never wanted divorce and now I keep reading about how God can get me through anything, those thoughts running through my head.  All my friends and family (and her family), many of them strong Christians, have said she is sick and I need to move on.  I just am bewildered that I am still having doubts after everything she has put me through, and I think that being right with God or wondering what His plan actually is for me is the only thing making me second guess before she comes back from her trip this weekend.  I know Jesus allows for divorce in this type of scenario but I also know He still hates it no matter what.

Edit:  Well I feel rather embarrassed now after reading all the comments posted.  I am seeing a therapist and the only reason I posted this here is because people who are unemotionally attached generally are able to have the clearest point of view.  Sure there were red flags before the wedding but I also knew the person she could be.  Still stupid I know but I really do love her.  I often have 3 or 4 days in which I feel strong and excited to move on and feel its a blessing and then days like yesterday where I get depressed and I don't want to believe this is happening.  I'll move forward with the divorce and in promising to someday forgive her,False,,t5_2qh6c,1349620099.0,,,t3_1128iu

As a 15 year old non-religious young man, I just generally don't agree with the way in which they chose to argue it. 

 I would also just like to clarify that I am well educated on the reasons why I don't believe in any religion. After frequenting r/atheism

And so I decided to see what it was like on the other side; I came to r/Christianity. From all the hatred, I suppose I was expecting some sort of reciprocation. Surely r/Christianity would have a lot to say about atheist life? I was totally wrong. I was also totally blown away by the love and compassion emitting from this subreddit. I saw nothing but kind words of help, condolence and positive energy. 

I just really wanted to say (I even made a reddit account just to post this), and I believe I am a much better person for it. I know it's been said by many other non-religious people already, but I had to say it myself;this subreddit is the definition of goodness. This is from one person to anyone who cares to read. I don't see myself as religious, I don't see myself as atheist, I just see myself as a person, as I would see any of you, and I can see many of the people on this subreddit are kind

4. Domestic violence
5. And on a smaller scale: cases of bigamy and marriages of convenience to gain passports.

By contrast look at what the gay community is doing for marriage. Their enthusiasm and eagerness to have the right to marry has reminded all of us how precious marriage is and what a privilege it is to be able to marry.

Because of this campaign by gay people

Yet another reason why allowing gay people to marry seems to me to be a fundamentally good thing.

A further point is that the argument that gay marriage will undermine heterosexual marriage is just patently stupid. If a married gay couple comes to live next door to me

How would my marriage be any less strong because two married gay people are living next door? Are people suggesting that I might decide the time has come for me to jump ship and sail in the opposite direction? What possible difference can it make to me or my wife that we have a same sex married couple next door?

The more I look at the arguments presented by the anti gay marriage lobby

EDIT

I'd like to thank all those who commented no matter what they said. I'd also like to thank everyone who voted

It's impossible to reply to every single comment so I would just like to make a general response. 

It seems to me that many (though not all) of the people who are objecting to same sex marriage are failing to come up with anything of real substance in response to my post but are merely arguing about semantics. A good example of this is the highest voted post from yukerboy.

This is a classic diversionary tactic when people haven't really got much of an answer. And the reason why they don't have much of an answer is because at the heart of this whole issue is a major contradiction. Namely that we say that we as Christians are loving people and yet on this issue we have a very unloving response to gay people - i.e. we are trying our best to ensure that a much persecuted and demonized minority group stays persecuted and demonized.

In the midst of all this are some wonderfully illogical observations. For example from one person we get the suggestion that gay people should not be allowed to marry because when they are unmarried they are promiscuous and unfaithful to their partners. And from the same person comes the bizarre comparison of divorce rates between married heterosexual couples and unmarried homosexual couples. I hate to point this out but unmarried people cannot divorce.

And finally, but when St Paul, for example, tells us that women should be silent in church we kind of ignore that one, because they happen to make up 50 percent of the population.

For me as a Christian the most important Bible verses are those that come directly from Christ.

1354142144.0,13yjam,"I grew up Mormon, now an atheist, but I still like to have a workable understanding of others' religion. In the past few months, I have realized that pretty much everything I know about Christianity has been tainted by Mormonism. Could I ask for a few clarifications?",CranialEruption,43, the more I become convinced that there *are* a lot of doctrinal problems between the two

1. We'll start with the big one, and the Holy Ghost as three discrete beings, but united in one purpose. They use scriptures such as John 17:3 (Jesus praying to God and referring to the two as different beings) and  Acts 7:55-56 (Stephen sees the Son of Man [Jesus] standing on the right hand of God) to back up these claims. As I understand it, the Christian view of God is more along the lines of three different faces of the same Being. Am I thinking about that right? Where did that belief come from, and why is it such a huge point of contention between the two?

2. The other big one, right? In Mormonism, belief in Jesus is part of it, but other things are required as well. For instance, Mormonism requires the living of a good, moral life and keeping God's commandments in order to obtain salvation, but still believe they are saved by grace after all they can do. So my questions are these: a) Where does the incentive to have good actions come in for a Christian who is saved only by grace? Couldn't a person do whatever they wanted, then when dying confess a belief in Jesus and be saved? b) One of the biggest condemnations of Mormonism I've heard from Christians is that Mormonism believes in salvation through works and not through grace. I don't see why it has to be a binary one or the other thing. Don't Jesus and the Apostles emphasize the importance of good works

3. The Theodicy and the problem of evil. Mormonism deals with this by saying this life is a test, who tempts men to not follow God. [NOTE: The big problem I have with the Mormon treatment of the theodicy is, while teachers can't interfere with tests, they also don't give out 10,000 different versions of what students will be tested on, and then let some idiot screw with the people taking the test. I could go on, if necessary].

4. Mormonism holds that sometime after Jesus died, disagrees with this. Mormonism also holds that men must be given authority from God in order to act in his name, called the Priesthood. They believe the correct priesthood was restored to the prophet Joseph Smith. I know this particular doctrine can be very different from church to church, some churches believing authority comes from the scriptures, some believing it was passed down linearly from Pope to Pope, and some believing it's not needed at all. Why such the disparity, and why would God's church be so disjointed in seemingly important areas such as this if not for some sort of Great Apostasy?

That's what I can think of for now

EDIT: Thought of another one - the cross. Mormons don't use the cross in any of their worship, you'll probably get some funny looks. Mormons say they'd rather remember how Jesus lived, and not how he died. How did the cross become such a big part of Christianity? Isn't the Ichthus the oldest Christian symbol? You still see it from time to time, but not nearly as much as the cross. Do they have any meaning other than a symbol of the Christian faith? Do Christians look down on people who *don't* display the cross?",,False,,1354142635.0,t3_13yjam

However, and it's mentionings in the bible. But still, I was not 100% sure one way or another if it was forbidden.

One of the things that I *did* believe made cannabis a sin is the fact it is against the law. This took me onto thinking about one of the main drugs I used to use which is a research chemical named AM-2201. I used to smoke a hell of a lot of this stuff and it ended up giving me some quite bad lung pain, because I was clearly having some rather serious negative health issues. But even still I could not stick to this promise and I would continue to smoke through the pain. Remember this, it is important for what comes next.

This drug is legal in my country, smoking only at nights. What's so bad about it anyway? It's legal, so no sin there. It has the same effects as a God made plant. I can keep it under control. Anyway, there wouldn't be any health implications if I wasn't smoking so much, right?

These were my thoughts. But before I made the order I *had* to get an answer from my Father. I had to know for sure one way or the other. So I simply prayed for a clear cut answer

A little while later I decided to pick up my bible and read from the book of Daniel, reading Daniel chapter one and my eyes move towards one of these notes. And this is what it read:

&gt;Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the king's rich foods. Have you ever made a similar resolution to abstain from certain foods or drinks in an effort to keep your body healthy?  If so

There has been a slew of bannings. A massacre of bannings, is it Christian behavior to ban non-Christian views? People do not get banned for not being atheists or expressing differing opinions, so why does it happen here? would God honestly be pleased that instead of respecting thine enemy and forgiving every offense you instead clot your ears and yell ""blah lah lah lah lah!"" This is **NOT** Christian behavior. This is the splinter in the eye of the Christian community, intolerance. I do not mind if you claim that a supernatural, omnipotent being exists. No matter how unlikely his details either, I don't care if he has eight tongues and no mouth. However, when you treat your fellow people badly then I take offense. Does God smile upon that sort of action?

He does not! I have never heard a view of God in which his nay sayers should even be considered a bother. In fact for my 16 years of Catholicism I learned tht those who didn't believe in him should be pitied, but every effort has to be put forth to save their souls. Imagine getting to the pearly gates and being denied entrance because you could have saved that heretic from eternal damnation and chose instead to pretend his opinion didn't even exist. This sort of intolerant stake burning is why anti-theists exist. Atheists generally arrive at their stance via philosophy and their own view of the world (which i will not affirm here even if I take it as well). Anti-theists see your hypocrisy, the beam in your eye, and come to the conclusion that religion can only cause a net negative result.

&gt;Today, and only considering up to the 4th dimension.


&gt;We humans. We are in the 3rd dimension. We are 3-dimensional beings, and Z. We have the power to move though this 3rd dimension and do with any object as we please. When we speak or make a sound, all sound can be defined in the 2nd dimension as a wavelength, or X and Y. The one thing we are immediately lacking is the power of 4th-dimension modifications, which is time. We are stuck with time being an ""all powerful"" force which we cannot touch.


&gt;Now for science! Any object that has a shadow loses one dimension. Hold your hand to a lamp and look at the shadow. Every part of the shadow is perfectly flat on a surface. It can be defined as X and Y on a flat surface. All 3-dimensional objects become 2-dimensional in shadow-form. A shadow is an ""image"" or ""likeness"" of the original object. Take note of the Tesserect here. 4th dimensional objects casts 3-dimensional shadows. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract


&gt;Now for theory. God exists outside of our world. He exists outside of Time. An all-knowing existence would live at the very least in the 4th dimension. In the 4th dimension, every little thing we do loses a dimension. Our voice is a 2D wavelength. Our shadow is a 2D image. God has a +1 dimension. When God spoke the world into existence, as a 4th-dimensional being, His voice would literally be 3-dimensional objects. Speaking in 3D! In the beginning of Genesis 26 it says, ""Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness"" To be an ""image"" or ""likeness"" of God Himself would make us shadows of Him


&gt;God spoke objects, God can actually be roughly but logically defined in the 4th dimension.

1357627362.0,1666ga,I've come back to faith. Overwhelming experiences. And a big thanks to this subreddit. ,francophonic,167,30,88,"I've come back to faith in Jesus. After about four and a half years of atheism...

Just for a touch of back story: I was born to not-that-into-it Baptist parents (of an Arminian branch) and I converted to Catholicism when I was younger with quite a lot of zeal. My parents originally were against this and I was forbidden to go to a Catholic Church so I was actually baptized Methodist, new philosophies, irritating theology study that seemed like I was always butting my head against a wall...all of it meant that I became an atheist and I became one **hard**. I viewed all those years of privately studying theology and patristics and languages as years that were *stolen* from me. I was angry. 


My pent up anger at sexuality issues


I never could shake religion though. The one quote that has stuck with me consistently in my spiritual journey is that beautiful quote from *The End of the Affair*: ""I have caught belief like a disease."" I never could shut up about Jesus. I hated him (so I said) but I couldn't get enough. I drove everyone near me almost to a breaking point because all I wanted to talk about was religion. I honestly couldn't swerve the conversation to anything besides this thing I claimed was a colossal waste of time. I tried desperately to make a non-theistic religious path work for me. I flirted with Pagans with loose beliefs about pantheism and tried until I was blue in the face to make Buddhism work for me. Hell


All that time bitching and moaning about Christianity...and it was all I read. Every nonfiction book. Whether it was rereading St. Augustine's *Confessions* or Karl Barth or Chesterton or whatever; it's all I gobbled down. It's all I grabbed at. 


Finally the other night I just stopped. I just stopped everything. I fell down on my bed and just admitted that I could run and screech and yell all I wanted but I couldn't stop it...I was in love with Christianity. I was in love Jesus. I was angry at the wrong thing. So I recommitted myself to my faith. I slowly removed the atheist bumper stickers and posters from my walls. I re-shelved my Bibles, books on hermeneutics and church history (the ones I kept in the bottom drawer near my bed). And I felt this immense relief. Like my entire body just released. I felt that feeling you get when a horrid pain in your back finally lets go and you sigh in relief. Or I felt like someone who had been desperately trying to have conversations in a country where I wasn't fluent in the language and finally finding someone who spoke my own. I felt like I was coming home, to a warm home with my favorite meal already cooked and steaming.


I'm examining myself daily, and doing this right...with an adviser and constant prayer). I'm joining the Episcopal Church (with which I've had a lot of experiences) within the next couple of weeks and starting back on that old ""disease of belief.""

http://www.northmaine.org/ 

Feel free to join us Sundays if you're in the Chicagoland area!)

I feel like I need to get something off my chest.

It bothers me  that Christians continually express shock

You’ve seen it
  Doesn’t anyone believe in marriage anymore?
  I can’t get over how many people today smoke weed.
  Can you believe they just sleep in instead of coming to church?
  Did you hear they moved in together? That’s so bad!
  What’s wrong with our government? Why don’t they uphold biblical  
  values?

Whenever I hear that
 
Think it through.

Most people in the West no longer consider themselves Christian.
Or even if they use the term “Christian” to describe themselves

So why would we expect them to behave like Christians? Why would we expect people who don’t profess to be Christians to:
  Wait until marriage to have sex?
  Clean up their language?
  Be celibate when they’re attracted to people of the same sex?
  Pass laws like the entire nation was Christian?

Seriously? Why? They’re not pretending to be Christians. Why would they adopt Christian values or morals?

Please don’t get me wrong. I’m a pastor. I completely believe that the Jesus is not only the Way

When you follow biblical teachings about how to live life

I do everything I personally can to align my life with the teachings of scripture

But what’s the logic behind judging people who don’t follow Jesus for behaving like people who don’t follow Jesus?

Why would you hold the world to the same standard you hold the church?
Before you judge a non-Christian for behaving like a non-Christian

1. They act more consistently with their value system than you do. It’s difficult for a non-Christian to be a hypocrite

2. Your disapproval is destroying the relationship (if you have even have a relationship in the first place). Some of the most judgmental Christians have zero non-Christians friends. Is that a surprise,  how many people have you made time for this week that you know disapprove of who you are and the way you live? Exactly.

3. Judgment is a terrible evangelism strategy. People don’t line up to be judged. If you want to keep being ineffective at reaching unchurched people

4. Judging outsiders is unChristian. Paul told us to stop judging people outside the church. Jesus said God will judge us by the same standard with which we judge others. Paul also reminds us to drop the uppity-attitude; that none of us were saved by the good we did but by grace.

So what can you do?

1.  Stop judging non-Christians. Start loving them. Very few people have been judged into life-change. Many have been loved into it.

2.  Empathize with non-Christians. Ask yourself

3. Hang out with non-Christians. Jesus did. And caught plenty of disapproval for it. I have a friend who continually drops f-bombs in my presence. As much as it bothers me

4. Pray for unchurched people. It is impossible to remain enemies with someone you genuinely pray for daily.

5. Live out your faith authentically. Your actions carry weight. Humility is far more attractive than pride. When a non-Christian sees integrity

I just have a feeling if we in the church loved the world the way Jesus did

In the past few days I've been thanked for moderating just right

With that in mind

A major exception that I and other mods make is on prayer request threads and (often) advice threads - those where the OP is often going through a crisis of some sort, I *will* be heavy-handed in removing posts that we see as not helping (or being explicitly harmful) to the OP, or posts seeking to start debate (it's not the time or place for debate, unless started by the OP). If the OP is discussing things w/ the poster that I think is crossing the line and appears unphased, I'll probably always leave the posts in.

If you do have a post removed

Humor/videos/etc - I'd love to see more humor on the board, [Music], [Meta], [Off-topic], etcetera.  From the small sample size that has done this, it seems to help forestall the reflexive downvotes while not misleading posters.

Thank you for your understanding,,False,,t5_2qh6c,False,,True

1338561972.0,ufnvl,I hope /r/Christianity will appreciate this little story about God's Providence this past weekend...,keatsandyeats,197,69,109,"One of the things my wife really wanted in our marriage was a dog.  I steadfastly refused.  I am not a dog person, my wife took advantage of my inability to say no when someone is in need.  A family friend needed to unload one of her three-year-old pups due to a nasty divorce.  There were no other prospective takers.

Slowly I began to get used to the idea of owning a dog.  A companion.  Man's best friend.  Happy to see you the moment you walk in the door.  From our decision to keep the dog till the date it was supposed to arrive - May 26 - we had a couple of months to wait.  By mid-May

Minutes after Millie was brought to our house, I couldn't help but feel a profound sense of loss.

I collapsed on my couch that evening
