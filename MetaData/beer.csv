I figure the best way to start is to list what I've had and what I did/didn't like.

Really didn't like:

* bud (salty) and bud light (bitter

* Coors light (very very bitter)

* yuengling black and tan (heavy and bitter)

* Shock Top (pumpkin wheat? Again too bitter)

Don't care for but could drink:

* Corona (not much flavor

* Pacifico (tasted like 1/2 corona and 1/2 ocean water)

* Miller lite (the first beer I ""liked"" but I've found better)

Beers I enjoy:

* Guiness (creamy

* Sam and Sam light (no complaints

* Michelob amber bock (probably my favorite flavorful beer that isn't too filling

* Land Shark (grabbed a 6-pack on a whim for a party over the weekend and loved it. Not a ton of flavor

Well there you go, also I'm located in Augusta, GA if that helps at all. I'll be on for the next few hours and will check back often so if you need to ask more questions go for it and I'll get back to you ASAP.

A few more beers in and he tells me that when he was a driver he would go into a liquor store and if a rival distributor had taken more space than he liked he would start damaging their product and pour beer all over their cases. Also

Now he is a sales rep and told me he goes to bars and if they don't have room on their taps for one of his beers he will use money provided by the brewery to buy what's left of a keg (usually a keg provided by a micro)

I have fond memories of climbing the big tree in his front yard or looking with wonder at all the odds and ends strung across his workbench. He would always teach me about growing food and take me on tractor rides, showing me the joys of honest work and living off the land.

The reason I mention him with PBR is this; Pabst was Homer's beer. That's all he drank, no Labbatt. PBR. His long-time girlfriend even put one in his casket before he was buried.

Well today is Homer's birthday, maybe skip the Miller and toss back a PBR for my gramps too. [To Homer.](http://skateparkoftampa.com/spot/images/tpro10pbr.jpg)

EDIT: I'm goin to bed now with a few cans in me. Thanks for the warm wishes everyone. Happy birthday gramps. May your tap never run dry.",self,t5_2qhg1,1370319572.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1flzb5/thoughts_on_pbr/

I am here to answer questions about Anheuser-Busch, barley, hops, brewing science, or anything you like. My goal is to give you honest answers, correct any misinformation/misconceptions, and share opinions about both Anheuser-Busch and beer in general.

This AMA should not be considered the official word of Anheuser-Busch. It is my words and opinion only. It is not being vetted by the marketing or communications departments; instead think of this as sitting down after work and having a beer (and yes I’ll be having beer(s) as this progresses – so should you!) with a current employee who will honestly share whatever he is able to. Obviously

Also, I can’t tell you much. I’m a beer and brewing guy, not a business guy. I’ll will try and answer your questions despite that though, provided I do know the answer.

One last note before we start: this is just one guy doing this AMA. It’s not a team of AB employees (I’ve verified this with the Beerit mod Adremeaux, and I wrote myself an outline. I did this to help me answer as many questions as possible, because I hate it when I’m reading an AMA and the author only answers like 4 questions or gives 4 word answers. So if you ask a question and see a detailed answer pop up in 2 minutes and you think, “There’s no way he could have written that fast”, you’re right. I probably copy/pasted some of it from my outline of anticipated questions. You guys might surprise me and ask nothing on my outline though, so I guess we’ll see.

So

Edit: Taking a short break at 5:50 CST to pick up my wife; be back shortly!

Edit 2: Back and reading

What would they be?,sculptorbyday,355,103,1232,"I recently saw a thread here that asked what beer would we choose if we could only have one for the rest of our lives. This is a question that I have posed to my friends in the past.

When we were talking about it, if you could only drink those for the rest of your life?  It changes the dynamic of the question, I think.  

Here are mine:

1. Bell's Best Brown (sweet

2. Goose Island Bourbon County Stout (intense

3. Hop Notch IPA (need an IPA in there





*update: I'm really happy with the response to this question. Here are some interesting things I've noticed:

1. There are more American Adjunct Lagers than I'd expect.  I'm not talking about the people that only choose adjunct lagers-- that is expected

2. Some of the most common beers have been: Bell's Two Hearted, Founder's Breakfast Stout or KBS, Edmund Fitzgerald, Pliney, 60 or 90 minute IPA, Zombie Dust.  Not a definitive list.

3. Some people wonder about the rules of the question.  My assumption had been that whatever beer you choose would become readily available to you

4. Some people choose specific vintages.  Some people choose breakfast, winter, and spring beers. Others choose strong, medium and light beers. Some people choose four beers, for some reason.",,False,t5_2qhg1,True

Monday afternoon I picked up a keg of [Marshall Brewing](http://marshallbrewing.com/index.asp) - Pub Ale.  For those that don't know

I let it sit overnight to get to temp and when I went to tap it, I closed the faucet and the foam didn't remain in the line - it started to work backwards, back into the keg. After a couple minutes the line was mostly empty again. 

I started perform a very rough and crude test to find Co2 equilibrium and wasn't until I hit 20 psi that liquid started to appear in the line

Just now I took it back to the liquor store - the owner was a bit of a jerk about it, the owner of Marshall Brewing called me and informed me he was making the one hour drive from Tulsa to where I live to replace my keg. I told him it wasn't necessary, but he insisted. I drove back to the liquor store - repurchased my keg and now Eric is driving to my house to swap kegs. 

Obviously

UPDATE:

He just left my house after dropping off the keg.  He is a smaller craft brewery so he handwrites batch numbers on the cap. When he saw the keg he proclaimed it was a really old batch number - he called the brewery and had them check the date - Feb 2, but they sold me a beer they have had stocked almost a year.

AND - he gave me a bomber of El CuCuy - a black IPA.

Update #2:  For those interested in the Black IPA - 

It. was. delicious.

It's an 8.5% beer so I thought you would be able to taste the alcohol - he did an exceptional job of balancing flavors and masking the taste of the alcohol - there was a hint

The bitterness with the hops contrasted really well with the dark malt tones - it was incredibly smooth and left a good flavor on the tongue.  For those that haven't had one - it's tastes like blending a stout with an IPA - with the highlights of both.  I don't know enough about this particular beer to go much further,,False,self,t5_2qhg1,True,,True

In having done that, bringing in all walks of beer knowledge by simply supporting independent breweries while not looking down our noses about it. 

Now, and therefore really ""light"" pale ales don't count because they're not pilsner style lagers (yes, you can shake and pound your head with me). These are the beers that i've been able to stock, and to a fair number of customers i'm still not meeting expectations:

* Full Sail Sessions (EDIT: Lager)
* Oskar Blues Momma's Little Yellow Pils (lager)
* Full Sail Pale (ale)
* Rogue GYO Good Chit Pils (lager
* ~~Fat Tire~~ New Belgium Shift Pale Lager 16 oz cans

I understand that you don't know my distribution list

What American independent breweries carry lagers that you guys think are the closest to the Miller/Coors/Bud water that so many people are are accustomed to? Thanks guys and gals. 

**TL;DR** Look right above at that last sentence.

On the other hand . . .  it's a beer tour . . . it feels a little . . . funny taking our 1 year old along with us.

So what would you [beer connoisseurs] think if you saw a couple with a baby at a brewery tour?

[I know some of you without kids would prefer not to have children around at all, we'd just as soon not force the issue, either.]



UPDATE:

Okay

Some posts were ambiguous because of the way I framed the question (Basically: ""No, this is unscientific.

Interpunct suggested I run this by r/parenting to see what they think.  I don't know that I'll really care what they think (you guys are my people)

***The Breweries:***

**Alchemist Cannery** - Hit this up at 11:15am on a Friday morning.  Rationed 1 case per customer.  Cannery was sold out of Heady cans by 1pm for the weekend.  Thank goodness we decided to hit this place first.  Tastings are free

**Hill Farmstead** - You are not lost.  You DO in fact have to travel 2+ miles down dirt roads into what seems like a barren uninhabited area in order to find HF.  When you arrive, and is not cheap.  Expect anywhere from $8 to $30 a bottle depending, so BRING EXTRA MONEY.

**Switchback Brewery** - They only make two beers, hands down.  Do not miss it.  Tastings are free and they don't skimp out on how much they'll let you try.  If you want a second tasting of the porter, simply ask (if they haven't already asked you).  Also, the brewmasters themselves do the tours, so ask anything you can imagine!

**Magic Hat** - Pretty interesting place.  They've definitely embraced their image as a funky style beer company.  Their tour was a bit disappointing as they were trying to keep ""in character"", hang out at the end of the bar near the taps.  They have a wall of what's available to be tasted, but there's always something else not on the wall down at the end that may be left.  

**Rock Art** - This place was awesome.  $4 to have 4 tastes, so it was nice to taste something other than overpowering hops in a beer here.  Also, they sell their bombers for about $3.75 at the brewery.  Pretty awesome pricing!

***The Brewpubs and Taphouses:***

**Prohibition Pig (Waterbury)** - Hit them up for dinner on Friday evening.  The service was pretty bleh.  Our appetizer was delivered to the wrong table (and subsequently eaten, and our drink requests had to be confirmed on more than one occasion.  Maybe we got a bad waiter, I'm not sure, but we were observing issues at other tables around us as well.  The draft list was decent, but was very heavily towards one or two styles of beer.  Was excited to see Lawson's on draft, until I realized it was 4 different IPAs from Lawson's.  Would have preferred some variety.  The food itself was pretty tasty though.  Bottle list was impressive, but a bit on the pricey side of things.  All in all

**Farmhouse Tap and Grill (Burlington)** - Hit them up Saturday morning for an 11am brunch.  Got the eggs benedict (which were mind-blowingly delicious).  The tap list was impressive AND had a great amount of variety.  The bottle list was also very impressive and more reasonable on prices.  Service was quick and flawless.  Cannot wait to go back.  Pro tip...get there BEFORE noon.  By the time we were leaving at 12:30

**Vermont Pub and Brewery (Burlington)** - We stopped here for some drinks and snacks mid-afternoon.  They do half-glasses, they do blends of several of their things.  I did the stout/forbidden fruit blend, and it was absolutely delicious.  One of my favorites of the trip.  For food, we got a cheese plate and a bowl of chili.  Neither was anything to write home for, but we were here for the beer and were not disappointed.

**American Flatbread (Burlington)** - Got here and had to wait about 35 minutes for a table (no surprise, and the Baltic Porter), but were also disappointed at the variety (4 different IPAs and 2 other Pale Ales) and availability (3 taps and their casks were empty).  The pizza was delicious and worth the wait and was a perfect end to our Saturday.

**Three Penny Taproom (Montpelier)** - WHAT A GEM.  This place blew our minds away.  We went there for brunch on sunday.  I had the bangers and potatoes with eggs (everything was amazing) and my buddy got the blueberry pancakes (mind blowing).  We also split an order of toast (which is enough to feed a mammoth

***Bottle shops:***

**The Warren Store** - Stopped here first on Friday morning seeking Lawsons.  To our dismay, so wouldn't bother stopping to again.

**Hunger Mountain Coop**- This place had an awesome selection

**Beverage Warehouse** - This place was a gold mine.  Picked up a bunch of stuff we can't find in MA, and a vertical of 09-12 of Old Stock regular.  This is the #1 place to go for bottles.

***Summary and some TL;DRs:***

 - Alchemist
 - Hill Farmstead
 - Prohibition Pig can be skipped.  
 - Three Penny is a mandatory stop.  
 - Switchback had the best tour.
 - Vermont LOVES Pale Ales.
 - Best Food
 - Best Beer (by variety and taste)
 - Favorite Beers?  Me: The Hill Farmstead/Jackie O collaboration Saison w/ Pumpkins.  My buddy:  Lawson's Finest Maple Chocolate Stout.  Both were found only at Three Penny Taproom.",self,t5_2qhg1,False,,tulip1,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1527gy/update_took_a_small_beercation_to_vermontthought/

Oregon is fortunate to have a brewing history going back 25 years or more

TL;DR: Drink local if you want your region to keep growing!

Some of you may remember me

Apparently a few of you thought I was doing something right, to opening a custom laser etching and marking business. It's been intense, to say the least. 

Since we picked up our laser, and remains our most popular product. We can etch damn near any type of glass, from pints to snifters, pilsners to tulips, wine glasses to tumblers. To bastardize the meme - if it fits, we zaps it. We've even begun adding nucleation marks to tulips and snifters, and the effects are pretty awesome ([here's a semi-out-of-focus video of one in action on some homebrew RIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsJXJWDaJBI)).

If you've read this far, however; we are custom shop, and because custom work inherently requires communication between us and the customer, we don't utilize online checkout. All online orders are direct billed through PayPal or Google Checkout, so make sure you mention this post on /r/beer to get your discount.

Hopefully I can help bring some interesting discussion to those who are interested.

I am the former head brewer at Santa Fe Brewing Company and currently a brewer at Brewery Ommegang. I did an AMA in /r/homebrewing a few months ago that went really well, technical operations, or just delicious beer. It's noon right now so I'm going to finish my coffee then crack open a Hennepin.

Also, breathes, sleeps and sweats beer.

Let's be friends on Untappd! https://untappd.com/user/Injun

I've been getting a lot of ""How do I get into the industry"" questions here and hopefully this will help:

Have a hardcore work ethic, but don't smother them. Breweries rarely want to hire ""regulars"" or even ""avid homebrewers."" You don't need to bring your homebrew to an interview. It's a nice bonus but it won't help me make a decision to hire you. If the beer is not good then I might not even hire you whether it was a good interview or not. I guess it depends on how bad the beer is!

A good way to become memorable in a brewer's mind is to geek out with them. Ask them about the science of what's going on. And DO NOT fake it. It is very obvious when someone is just trying to look good but doesn't actually know what they're talking about. Be sure to check Pro Brewer and the Brewer's Association Forum for job postings. If the posting says ""requires experience"" and you don't have experience the resume will not be looked at. Expect to be packaging for 2 years before you move up to brewing.

Keep checking your local breweries and make friends in the industry. Good luck to you!",self,t5_2qhg1,1363984512.0,,trap2,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1aszd1/iama_pro_brewer_who_loves_beer_and_those_who/

-------------------------------------

**DENVER BREWERIES**

**[Renegade Brewing Company](http://www.yelp.com/biz/renegade-brewing-company-denver)** - My favorite local brewery

Monday: Midnight in Bruges (Belgian Black IPA)

Tuesday: Secret Agent (Alt bier)

Wednesday: Farmer's Daughter (Farmhouse Ale)

Thursday: Black Gold (Peanut Butter Cup Stout)

Friday: Apostate (Low-gravity IPA)

Saturday: Javert (brandy barrel-aged Belgian Strong Ale)


**[Wit's End Brewing Company](http://www.yelp.com/biz/wits-end-brewing-company-denver)** - IMO, in an industrial part of town, but the owner is super friendly and will take the time to shake your hand and chat for a few minutes. Again, special tappings all week long as well as extended hours.

**[River North Brewery](http://www.yelp.com/biz/river-north-brewery-denver)** - They primarily use Belgian yeasts in their brews

**[Copper Kettle Brewing Company](http://www.yelp.com/biz/copper-kettle-brewing-company-denver)** -  A little further from downtown

**[Breckenridge Brewery](http://www.yelp.com/biz/breckenridge-brewery-denver)** - One of Denver's bigger breweries, solid beers.  Check out the Agave Wheat. [Here's their line up for the week](https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/543354_10152148914170302_167146564_n.jpg)

**[Great Divide Brewing Company](http://www.yelp.com/biz/great-divide-brewing-company-denver)** - Located in the heart of LoDo just steps from the ballpark.  Their flagship brews are solid and they always have something interesting on tap since they just installed a 7 barrel pilot system.  Don't leave Denver without having some Yeti.

**[Bull &amp; Bush](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bull-and-bush-denver-3)** -  They recently took home 4 medals at the World Cup in San Diego, they pour your beer into a French press and bring you out a saucer of fresh hops, add as many hops as you like and then ""dry hop"" your beer yourself)

**[Del Norte Brewing Company](http://www.yelp.com/biz/del-norte-brewing-denver)** - Mexican style beers.  They just opened a new tap room.

**[Dry Dock Brewing](http://www.yelp.com/biz/dry-dock-brewing-aurora)** - Kinda far from downtown in Aurora

**[Vine Street Pub](http://www.yelp.com/biz/vine-street-pub-denver)** -  Sister to the Mountain Sun of Boulder, so be prepared.

**[TRVE Brewing Company](http://www.yelp.com/biz/trve-brewing-co-denver-2)** -  Brand new brewery just a hop and a skip from downtown, but you don't have to like the genre to enjoy the brews, they're not blasting heavy metal throughout the place at ear shattering levels.

**[Hogshead Brewery](http://www.yelp.com/biz/hogshead-brewery-denver)** - English style brews on tap and in casks.

**[Caution Brewing Co.](http://www.yelp.com/biz/caution-brewing-co-denver)** - You could probably hit this one on the way into the city from the airport

**[Yak and Yeti](http://www.yelp.com/biz/yak-and-yeti-arvada-2)** - This is actually a Indian/Nepalese restaurant

**[Golden City Brewery](http://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-city-brewery-golden)** - Located in Golden, CO! :D

**[Strange Brewing Company](http://www.yelp.com/biz/strange-brewing-company-denver)** - In a quirky spot under the interstate

**[Prost Brewing](http://www.yelp.com/biz/prost-brewery-denver)** - Another relatively new brewery to the Denver area, comes from Dry Dock where he was the head brewer.  Bill is very talented at his craft and is producing a lot of old world style beers.  You're not going to find a lot of quirky, experimental beers here.  What you will find are a lot of German beers that are true to their styles and executed perfectly.  Fun fact about Prost: its brewhouse is a seventy-barrel system that the owners acquired earlier this year from a brewery that was closing in the famous beer-making region of Bamberg, Germany. The gorgeous copper system was disassembled and sent by ship to the States, where it was reassembled in Denver.

**[Crooked Stave](http://www.crookedstave.com/)** - Chad Yakobson

DFH collaboration My Antonia
FiftyFifty Eclipse  
EvilTwin Ron and the Beast Ryan  
Paradox Smokehead  
De Ranke XX Bitter

Dobbel Dose (Dobbel Dram)  
Double Bastard 2010 &amp; 2011  
Three Floyd's Zombie Dust

New Glarius Wisconsin Red  
Bell's Wedding Ale  
2009 Old Stock Reserve  
Hopslam 2010 &amp; 2011  
Pliny (3 weeks from bottling)  


  

First of all

Many people online seem to prefer the 2010 Abyss over the 2009 (some of the 2009s were infected overall, preferred the 2011.

Dark Lord is super sweet compared to all the other stouts.  It's a dessert stout!

Two beers surprised everyone:  The Dissident and Old Stock Reserve.  The Dissident is such a delicious drinkable mild sour.     I have always loved Old Stock Reserve and was glad to share it with others - probably half the people in attendance said it was their favorite of the night.  I don't think it gets the credit it deserves.

Zombie Dust and My Antonia seemed to be the other favorites of the night.

As expected

1340718986.0,vmng2,American Budweiser vs. Czech Budweiser. What's the deal?,bemonk,214,52,122,"
What is the deal with American Budweiser (which I will refer to as ""Bud"" from here on out) and Czech Budweiser (which I’ll call “Czechvar” to keep the confusion to a minimum)? I’ll tell you. If for no other reason than that this way I have a place I can link to instead of having to find the details every time someone asks.

I’m an American living in the Czech Republic and get asked this quite a bit (I was a tour guide for a while). Sometimes people aren’t even aware that they are two different things; which is a shame

I’ll start with the history. Bud is from Anheuser-Busch. When Mr. Busch married Anheuser’s daughter he joined his father’s-in-law’s brewery. At the end of the 19th century Busch went off looking for ways to improve his brewing methods
Busch thought that was a good name and Bud was born. This was in 1876.

Czechvar is of course from Česky Budejovice and is still going strong today. There are actually two breweries (that I know of) that still brew beer from Česky Budejovice under the name „Budweiser“ (Budvar and Bürgerbräu). One was from the same time as Anheuser-Busch’s, I guess a left over from it’s Communist days when it was nationalized.

The legal and trademark distputes are morce complicated and not always as one sided as one might think. Bud was registered first, which keeps it going as „Budweiser“ in several countries. And Czechvar’s Budweiser logo looks an awful lot like the one Bud came up with. This didn’t matter in the Communist days, but does now. Point for Bud.

However. By EU’s standards (and mine) Bud is not Beer. It is a malt liquor. Beer does not have rice and corn as ingredients (by defenition in the EU) and Bud does (EW!!). Bud also uses gimmicks that are pretty low brow. One example: in the UK they like to see lines of bubbles in the beer (sign of quality or something) and since Bud doesn’t do that (it just kind of sits there) Anheuser-Busch sold or gave away special Bud glasses that were laser cut in the bottom of the glass so they would have those bubbles. 

Also

There’s my 2 cents folks. There’s a wiki page about this, there are dozens of them). Both breweries recently came to an agreement to sell Czechvar in the states as „Czechvar“.. so go enjoy one!

I see a ton of new breweries in the works around the NW and I'm sure it's the same in other parts of the US. 

I see a lot of home brewers going pro starting nanos and investing a lot of time and money to release a very small amount of beer to market. Other than starting to build a name to hopefully scale up production I cannot see them being a sustainable business model. 

Others have started breweries by looking around at the beer scene

This all hinges on quality to me. People have access to amazing quality craft beer these days and are becoming well educated and critical about the beer they consume

Is this reasonable or am I just a negative Nancy?

I like pretty much everything I've had from Dogfish Head but I live in Oklahoma where we cannot get any Dogfish Head products so it's only on vacations that I get too enjoy them. Also being a hop head I always get a four pack of the 90 min IPA when I can. I've been casually searching for the fabled 120 min for a year or so now

Anyway

Now I know American craft breweries have been in an IPA craze lately and some people roll their eyes at the race to create hop monsters of insanely bitter proportions. I understand that but I for one love it. I've also heard that the 120 minute is almost a novelty with its 15-20% ABV. So I really wasn't sure what to expect. 

http://imgur.com/hEPUA


**Actual Review**

The taste comes on almost sweet and then suddenly divides and separates into the deeper rich and heavy flavor you expect from an imperial IPA. The hops come in after with a bit of what almost feels carmelish to me. The big kicker for me was once you've swallowed you realize how incredibly light the body of the beer actually was. You can also feel the burn in your stomach of that high ABV like you just had a whiskey shot. 

My final conclusion is that this is a wonderful and delicious brew that any hop head should try if he/she gets the chance.

Rules of engagement:

To be more specific, you are allowed to have a lemon shandy, but no beer cocktails containing other alcoholic drinks. 

You are allowed to choose a a mixed drink, you must specify which beers are going in, and only those beers may be used and only in combination. This rule makes more sense for mixed drinks, but I pull the strings so I make the rules. An example: choosing Death's door vodka would allow for a vodka tonic, but never a vodka martini because that would include two types of alcohol. Another example, if you choose a boilermaker, you will be forever forced to have that shot with the beer. 

There are no limitations on rarity

edit: This is not an unlimited free supply

The guy from San Diego actually worked as head of social media for Lost Abbey.  Tomme, drank a ton of amazing beer, and shot the shit.  In the end, they brought:

* Yellow Bus
* Veritas 003
* Veritas 004
* Veritas 005
* Cable Car Kriek
* Isabelle Proximus
* Cuvee de Tomme 2009 (750ml)

Tomme told some great stories, we didn't get a shirt.  Yet.  They are in the mail, as they had no way of getting our t-shirt sizes without looking REAL suspicious ;-)

 My question here is: Was I wrong to allow him to try his first sip of beer at this age?

I'm fully expecting to be flamed into oblivion here but I need some other opinions and experiences from fellow parents here.

Not that it matters but the beer was Pliny the Elder. I've had a hard time finding it in my area and on that day I was lucky enough to find a couple bottles at a local market (first time I ever tried it as well)

(r/beertrade Crosspost.),kanos777,169,42,52,"A beer blogger with a decent following totally screwed me on a trade. In person I gave him a Vuja De and some fresh Pliny. His end of the trade was some founders goodies and KBS once it released 2 weeks later.

We were in periodic contact via email before and after the KBS release He claimed shipping was delayed on his end due to some extenuating circumstances which I can understand at this point

So here we are a year from the original trade and I still have no box or tracking number. I'd let it go and chalk it up to table stakes for beer trading if he wasn't so involved in his local beer culture. It's not even a big trade I feel like this person just cant be bothered to care. If the package did ship I would at least have expected a tracking number somewhere along the line but I was never given one over the course of what must have been 20+ emails. 

I know this is a boring clusterfuck of a story but your advice is appreciated. 



tl;dr: Got fucked over by fronting beer in person to a popular beer blogger. Should I give out his blog and info?

Edit: So I emailed him a recap of events as I saw them and asked him for an explanation. I told him I've given up on getting beer from him but if he convinces me this wasn't malicious I will drop it if not I will post his blog here. I don't want to ruin a reputation for what may have been a horrible chain of events. I Will follow up when I hear back. 

Edit 2: I posted a follow up thread but the short of it is he is staying anonymous and is going to make right on the trade.

1322345570.0,mq827,Best Brewery Tour Ever: Lagunitas Brewery ,,143,16,53,"Preface: I haven't done too many brewery tours. I did Stone's tour earlier this year and got to visit Green Flash on their 9th anniversary (unfortunately this meant no tours that day). I've done a few winery tours up in Napa/Sonoma as well.

This is not a tour on which you will learn the biochemistry of beer. But it is the most heartwarming

On their website, it is mentioned that the tour is at 3 pm (no reservation information, which was a little worrying).

(*Edit: After a little more research

As it was 2:25 pm when I discovered this

I recognized the somewhat small sign right away from the road and turned in. We parked and then tried to find the actual brewery. It was 2:52 pm and I was a little worried about being late and missing everything (especially considering that for Stone's tours you have to reserve 2 hours ahead of time!). A parking attendant directed us to the back right corner of the lot and told us a loud

We wandered around and considered getting some beer to start but decided to wait as the tour would start soon (and as my mom is not much of a drinker). We tried to find some sort of line or more information but to no avail. We did see quite the number of people hanging out

Eventually, us included. There must have been 40 or so of us.

Our tour guide, bearded man in his late 20s/early 30s(?) dressed in plaid. He lead us up some stairs into this room which was a cross between an old time pub one may see on tv and a heavily decorated bedroom of some teenager from the 80s'. Everything in there was amazing. There were many old comfy couches to sit on and so many pieces of art/memorabilia  on the wall to study. Gary the snail, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, a model ship, those brown burlap sacks that produce can be shipped in (claiming to be filled with 50 lbs of weed in the past), a stop sign that says WHOA, a chandelier made of tiny dolls (made me think of Sid from Toy Story)...

The first thing we did was drink! They brought out 5 beers in 4 oz(?) tasters, the Censored, the IPA, and the Doppel Weizen. They did bring them out rather quickly but there was no rush to finish them because as soon as it calmed down a little, Ryan began his 20 or so minute history of company. 

What I loved about the stories shared here were that they were just hilarious and always about Lagunitas sticking it to the man. Also

And the edible had begun to seriously kick in. I laughed knowingly at all the jokes and really began to dissect the beers we were tasting. They were hoppy and lovely. My mom

Ryan was a great storyteller and tour guide. Some of the crowd, Ryan immediately called him out. Maybe 5 minutes later, this guy began again but was once again shut down and that was the end of any trouble. Overall though, the crowd became a ton of fun as they became more tipsy.

We got to see the new brewroom they are building and it was beautiful. The walls were purple and the accents were this hotpink/red. Very different from the standard eggshell white on white.

We also got to walk very close to all of the functioning brewing equipment. Perhaps a little dangerous but really fucking cool. More information was given on the history of the company and the naming of the beers. This shit is entirely worth going to Lagunitas and getting the tour - there is just so much backstory to everything that they do

Finally, after my trip to the restroom, he had disappeared. 

I paid for the $5 sampler, the Little Sumpin Sumpin, the Lagunitas Sucks, and the Wet Dog. I had really wanted to try the Marshall Ranch but they were out - next time!

I don't know that I could pick a favorite out of these. I just remember lots of beautiful tropical smells (guava, pineapple) and gorgeous colors. Lots of amazing, fresh, green hops. Grassy, dank hops. Citrus-y, piney, resinous hops. 

Hop Stoopid used to be one of my favorite beers, I thought I had found my one true beer love. Yesterday, my love for Hop Stoopid was reawakened but I believe out of the four, I liked Wet Dog and Lagunitas Sucks the most. Maybe Wet Dog the most - it was wet hopped and delicious. 

Next time

Most proffessional/semi-pro beer snobs seem to be obsessed with extremely bitter beers. Imperial/Double IPA's (Ruination, Dead Guy Ale), Stouts (Dark Lord, Breakfast Stout). Sure, there's a ton of complex flavors. That doesn't mean they're *good* flavors. Also, Hop Stoopid tastes like frickin' grass.

I prefer the other side of the beer spectrum: Golden and delicious beers. Duppels, Single IPA's. I've been known to sneak in a Quadruppel or a Russian Imperial Stout here and there. These are flavorful, but definitely not bitter, beers. This whole ""yellow fizzy beer is bla bla bla"" and ""it's not real beer if you can see though it"" attitude is tiresome, and projets a negative image of the noble beer snob.
