That way you could show the kid that there are no monsters in the room.  

Maybe there could also be a 'monster radar' type app that scans in all directions around the phone.

Perhaps include a printable QR code that when placed on the wall with make a monster show up that you can 'zap' out of the way.

We created this app to figure it out for us. It uses your location (GPS or manually set) to find the price of stations in the area (similar to gasbuddy)

A station farther down the road might have gas for $3.50 vs the one down the corner at $3.55

We would really appreciate some support and help getting us noticed!

Edit: Thank you all for the responses and constructive criticism so far. We are listening to your suggestions and ready to work on creating features that you would like to see implemented in the future. We have a few plans **(big ideas)** that we are working on... not ready to disclose them right now for obvious reasons of getting them stolen.

Edit2: Here are descriptive app pictures explaining how the app works- as kushanj1 requested: [pic1](http://i.imgur.com/Mcv4iq6.png), [pic4] (http://i.imgur.com/XpDfBmA.jpg), [pic5] (http://i.imgur.com/p0HOtYv.jpg)

Edit3: Here is the current list of new features that have been requested so far and will be implemented in the next update. Feel free to leave a comment with anything you'd like to see.

* Inside settings page:

* Allow showing gas stations in the list even if price is N/A or last updated over a month ago. (Some people are reporting not seeing all stations in the area

* Add feature to calculate time taken to drive to/from station as a function of hourly pay/ (value of personal time per hour). (Is it *really* worth it to drive out of the way?)

Edit4: **One long week later** we have finally made an update with the features you all requested. It should be available to download within a few hours (whenever google play decides to update our page). Those of you who purchased the app: leave your feedback here and please rate the app on google play- it helps us get noticed and only takes a minute. 
We also released a *free* lite version of our app for those who just want something simple: [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appwizards.fuelwizlite)

Well basically I managed to implement something very unique in this version that will improve dramatically it's usage

Yes

We also added the onion skin feature in this version so people that like to do stop-motion can see a transparency of the last frame so they can properly prepare the next shot ...

So everything is great right? Even more because I decided to just give the app for free for the weekend in this sub-reddit :)

Only thing I ask? PLEASE, in the settings go to ""background modes"" and read the differences there and let me know what and what not work and your device model.

Also test the stop motion mode and tell me if the picture is perfectly aligned with what was being previewed ( You can change to stop motion mode in the capture screen

Round about the time Reddit was raising pitch forks against SOPA I was reading a sci-fi book (whose title and author escape me now) which had a world where all the citizens voted on laws via their implants. 

I thought it would be awesome if we had the technology to do that instead of having to rely on politicians to represent our interests. Then I realized that we did (well minus the implants of course ....). That everyone holds in their hands a device which can be used to vote on a bill before parliament.

I'm currently tracking bills before parliament for the following countries:

United States of America

United Kingdom

Canada

Australia

New Zealand

South Africa


I'll be adding State or provincial bills over the next couple months and hopefully getting down to local or municipal government by early next year.

It still very basic and a far cry from my final vision for what it will be but I'd love to get some feedback from Reddit before unleashing it on the world.

edit 1: The app is also currently only available in the above countries.

edit 2: *** This app is only compatible with phones or tablets with telephony hardware ***

edit 3: I've uploaded a new version of the app with several changes thanks to the feedback I have received so far. It can take a few hours to be available so if you want to wait for it keep an eye out for version 1.31 to show up.

I noticed recently that in poweramp

Users: how would people feel about moving menu bars to the bottom, but apple was smart in forcing their notification bar in an upward fashion. im sure this was to avoid lawsuits and i know you can change this with nova gestures, but to me this is a basic thing that should have been implemented as stock a long time ago)

Devs: How easy would it be to implement this in future updates or at least allow the option to do this? Poweramp is one of the only apps I know to allow this(i'm sure there are more I do not know about). 


Examples:

Pretty much every brower: why not put the url at the bottom so i can reach it more easily? if i wanted to sit down and search i would use a computer(extreme example but you get it

Gmail/maps: same thing, i shouldn't be doing this, but lets be real, we all do it from time to time)

Phone dialer: phone/recent/people menu is at the top

Even the reddit apps could use a redesign by placing the frontpage/menu bar at the bottom.

Here's my latest update for my notes app. I've added a lot of features the last months. This time I added search options and a feature to create a new note with the share function from other apps.

At the moment I have received request for cloud backup of notes. I Hope to add it in future updates. If you have any other suggestions for improvements please leave a message

Also--because there are more than 1000 Android devices out there--let me know if you hit any technical problems.

And... thanks guys. Ya kind of slog away at these sorts of projects then when you release them you have no idea how they're going to do or if people will find them useful.

Updated the InstaCamera app in the Market to include these features:  

* flash
* shutter volume now working properly

* changed the location for images

Swiftkey is the greatest thing ever for anyone with a touch screen. My god. This is literally fantastic. Even if you're not a swype fan
Did I mention it's $3.99 in the Play Store but FREE for the BETA  which is actually the SAME EXACT version WITH SWYPE?! 
Yeah

You'll also want to search out Quick keyboard switch app for ease of access.

* Color Note

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.socialnmobile.dictapps.notepad.color.note&amp;hl=en 

Color note is this nifty little app that allows you to make note cards
+ With SwiftKey taking notes is easy as pie. I'm texting at like some absurdly high word count right now with minimal error. Aww yee brb sunglasses. (⌐■_■) aww yeee

* Elixer 2 

https://play.google.com/store/search?q=elixer2&amp;c=apps 

Elixer 2 is actually so complicated it boggles me. I don't understand why or how this is FREE. This literally is mind blowing guys. 10/10 would download again.
I've only had a smart phone for 9 days now, wifi settings, custom settings, everything settings, super customizer on steroids on super crack! It's got so many awesome settings it'll blow your minds. It feels like I'm on a rooted device with all the options this thing gives. You can create custom icons and other such things down to a core level like battery voltage o_O. Try it. It's FREE!

A very simple and FREE GBAEmulator. It doesn't come with ROMS, no. Technology has gone too far O_O
http://i.imgur.com/n80o9.png

SkEye is this pretty awesome stargazing app. Basically, and minimalistic. I like it :)

* Skype

If you don't know exact what Skype is shame on your! SHAME! 
It's video chat / AIM / Contact Book.

* Nova Launcher 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher.prime&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS50ZXNsYWNvaWxzdy5sYXVuY2hlci5wcmltZSJd

This is basically a new desktop for lack of better explanation. It's very very very customizeable

* QuickPic

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alensw.PicFolder&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5hbGVuc3cuUGljRm9sZGVyIl0.

QuickPic replaces ""Gallary"" 
That's really all there is to it. It's awesome. Try it. It's light weight and easy to use.


* Landscape Wallpaper

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lwp.superluminar.swallpaper&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImx3cC5zdXBlcmx1bWluYXIuc3dhbGxwYXBlciJd 

LSW is basically what it sounds like. It turns your photos (ANY OF THEM!!) into a ""scrolling"" background. Go watch the video :) it's easy enough to use


* Scanner Radio

This is basically for people who want very quick icons for their settings and don't want to learn Elixer 2 (I found Elixer after I found this as I downloaded this day 1 with the phone). They work pretty well

* PolarisViewer 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.infraware.polarisviewerupdater_D2VZW&amp;hl=en

This will properly allow you to render a ton of different file types
It's amazing how well it works considering the more popular versions seem to suck balls and bombard with adverts and kill battery and not render properly. 

* Light Manager LED (for the S3 Light Flow seems to have issues on some models) or Light Flow (for everyone else?)

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koo.lightmanager&amp;hl=en

Hmm. This one baffles me. Please go watch the video, from what I've read the S3 has some issues with LED and unrooted phones (lol look at me sounding like I know what I'm talking about :3 I'm a newbie.)

* Llama (Location Profiles)

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kebab.Llama&amp;hl=en

This smart little app seems to know where you are. Based on that information it can do stuff! What type of stuff you ask? Well, the alarm clock is disabled (also when in class, although I haven't set a defined area for ""in class"" yet) encase I'm up early, and wifi is turned off. When I walk back into ""HOME"" all of that turns back on :o and Skype loads up and so does my alarm clock so I can reset it :o
It's awesome!

* The Akinator Genie (sorta not free)

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digidust.elokence.akinator.paid&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5kaWdpZHVzdC5lbG9rZW5jZS5ha2luYXRvci5wYWlkIl0.

Alright this guy is $1.99. That's too much in my opinion as it's massively entertaining for maybe 25 minutes tops. I'm cheap, so you all need to check that out. What is it you ask?
Let me just tell you up front that you wont ever feel comfortable with computers again O_O
You pick a ""character"" real or fake... and it knows. IT KNOWS O_O Don't think of it as 20 questions

* Kingsoft Office 5.3.1 (Free)

This is apparently like Power-Point, that someone like me probably end up just making art out of.

Then it asks you to buy the pay version. The Paywall is $7. I use FoxFi and it has been useful and transparent. It works without root (tho I have root). 

The update of last weekend (Sat Nov 17) changed everything.  FoxFi now disconnects every 20 minutes and offers you a chance to buy it for $7. There --it's disconnected while I was writing this--. 

It was a surprise to find it crippled into _nagware_ and within their rights but... If I buy it will they change it again? How do I know? I bought the pro version of a recording app only to find that it wouldnt work in Canada since I couldnt connect to the internet there to pass their paranoid theft check for each use. _H8._

I've been using google music on my phone since it came out

Google music still sucks at: 
 
*  metadata
*  tracking duplicates
*  ignoring local files
*  music selection
*  availability

Metadata/duplicates:  How hard is it to sync metadata between my local computer and the cloud?  If I rename the file, and then reupload it with the correct metadata.  that or, edit the metadata twice!  its silly that they cant watch for changes.  The metadata editor on the cloud is 'ok', but i still have problems with it: it fails to update files (minutes) and it fails to edit all files if you select multiple files.  I've never had a good experience adding thumbnails, I've given up on that front.  

Ignore local files - I'm fucking tired of this mess.  I have google voice, and the way they are i have to remove each individual one.  Random ringtones.  Random mp3s.  Its a fucking mess!  All I want is to tell google music where my music fucking actually is, and to ignore the rest of my phone.  Say goodbye to ever getting to use shuffle when you've got hour long lectures just waiting to be played.

Using the app is sometimes annoying.  you click something and click back, the playlist doesnt move to match the now playing song--it just fucking sits there.  if you accidentally click somewhere wrong, you've just selected a single song, instead of the album, and you've cleared your playlist.

thumbtack icon doesn't dissappear if you dont have data.  I fucking know I want to download music to my phone!!! when it has data! right now my phone doesnt have a connection

Just simple stuff other players have:  
sleep timers, 

and too many times have I tried to play a song only to be told that the song isn't available at that moment...oh well,False,self,t5_2reen,False,,,t3_1d6467

I was hoping to get some feedback about an app I've been working on that uses NFC tags to create conversations allowing people to share comments

Despite a small amount of downloads there's already a DZero tag somewhere in London to which someone posts pictures of paintings

A single topic e.g. ""Ingress players in New York"" *could* be written to hundreds of tags meaning that each tag at each portal would launch players into the same conversation or to just the one

Other ideas I anticipate people using the app for are;

* [Dead Drops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_drop) - Could be interesting?
* Tables in a bar / restaurant - leave reviews / recommendations or chat with other people in the bar anonymously 
* Indie brewers / cooks etc - Add a DZero sticker to bottles of beer / beer pumps and get feedback from people who've actually had a bottle
* As information points - Imagine if next to the price on a shelf there was a DZero NFC tag allowing you to read what other people have said about the product

Anyhow

I couldn't really find a launcher / user interface that would suit their needs specifically on a tablet

We've made the icons super big and easy to read and actually the layout changes depending on whether you hold the device in landscape or portrait mode. 

We'd actually like to develop the app a bit further

Me and my wife have been looking for a solution for this and I think I have found something that works most of the time.

I installed Scanthing from the Google Play store. This lets you use your phone's camera to scan typed text (such as a question on a quiz) and send the photo to Scanthing's servers to OCR it. Scanthing then sends this back to your phone as text. I can share this with Talk - Text To Voice.

What you need:

- [""Tasker""](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;hl=en)

- [""Wol Wake on Lan Wan""](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.benfinnigan.wol&amp;hl=en)

- [""NFC Task Launcher""](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jwsoft.nfcactionlauncher&amp;hl=en)

- Some programmable NFC tags

- The ability to have your PC 'Wake up on LAN'



The general principle here, which the computer takes as an indication to power up.

- Step 1: Turn on Wake up on LAN via the BIOS (or UEFI) on your motherboard. I'm not going to go into detail on this step


- Step 2: Find your MAC and IP address for the PC you want to start. In windows 7 this is easily done by opening the Network and Sharing center, then pick out the 'IPv4 address' and 'Physical Address'.


- Step 3: In the WoL app, then add your MAC address and IP address into the appropriate fields. For me, the port field wasn't important (I left it as 9), and I left the rest of the fields as default. Press save and go back to the main screen for the WoL app. At this point you may want to press on the event you just created to test whether the packets you're sending actually wake your PC.


- Step 4: Open tasker and go to the Tasks tab. Create a new task and name it something like 'Wake PC'. Add a new action to this task, click 'Edit' and choose the appropriate event you just created in step 3.


- Step 5: At this point, however you could easily use tasker to trigger the event using any criteria you wish! To use the NFC tags, I wrote a new tag via the NFC task launcher app. From the main page, click the + to create a new tag, then select 'New Task' from the tag type choice.

* a running one (I don't run

* Yoga ones (okay this is basically the only other one I want.); an app that goes through the steps of yoga

**Background/ Conclusion:**

I used to use Wii Fit (and EA Active) for my exercises, who kind of knows some moves, but needs help tracking routines, and learning new exercises. 

**Update on What's been tried**

* Bodbot - I like this app so far, and other more customizable sections.
* Jefit - Not a bad app, and I have not broken my comfort zone to go to a gym yet. (Maybe one of these days though)

[Weather Alerts](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.katzmatt.dashclock.weatheralerts) is a DashClock extension that displays the current National Weather Service alert status for your current (or a set) location. The extension requires Android 4.2

If you're more visual

Breadcrumbs is an app that allows you to see what's happening at all your favorite places - all in one dashboard. Instead of going to a business' Facebook page or a Twitter page or relying on your newsfeed to show you info you want to see

http://breadcrumbs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/phone-places-list.png  

What's cool is that a business doesn't have to participate in our program for us to provide useful information about them. We match Foursquare locations with social media pages (currently only support Facebook) and so Breadcrumbs works for a business whether it's located in San Francisco

The coolest part is when a business is participating in our program. If you're tracking a business and you're in the area when they've got something going on

The news aggregating apps I started using to view

**Samsung Note II**

[**Currents**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.currents&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5nb29nbGUuYW5kcm9pZC5hcHBzLmN1cnJlbnRzIl0.) Google's beautifully done app.  It contains a huge selection of news sources for a variety of categories and countries.  I find myself keeping up with Slate, Smithsonian, Forbes and many other online magazines over at Currents.

[**Flipboard**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=flipboard.app&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImZsaXBib2FyZC5hcHAiXQ..) Again a very smooth and beautiful UI that could overlap with Currents in relation to content but still has a selection of sources that Google Currents doesn't have (and vice versa).  

[**News Republic**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobilesrepublic.appy&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5tb2JpbGVzcmVwdWJsaWMuYXBweSJd) For more direct news on current affairs rather than analysis and reports

Not so much a news aggregator (although it can be used as such if you follow people's 'notebooks' on Springpad - but I choose not to use it that way) I use it to save webpages or contents that I would like to keep for future use.  So for example if I found an interesting cheesecake recipe somewhere

[**Pocket**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideashower.readitlater.pro&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5pZGVhc2hvd2VyLnJlYWRpdGxhdGVyLnBybyJd) This app (and Chrome [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pocket-formerly-read-it-l/niloccemoadcdkdjlinkgdfekeahmflj?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon) and [app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pocket/jijgclgmgjipgefcnnnibgllfonlfdap?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon) ) allows you to save articles for future offline reading.  As there is no data connection in the London Underground

[**BBC News**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bbc.mobile.news.uk&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImJiYy5tb2JpbGUubmV3cy51ayJd) I'm in the UK so for more local news I would check this app which is surprisingly really well done.

[**Economist**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.economist&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsInVrLmNvLmVjb25vbWlzdCJd) Without paid subscription you can't read everything

I'm looking for some help determining some of the custom settings that are available for various device models.

Some of the features are

 - Configurable Menus.
 - Multiple Interface Options.
 - Real time crop with secondary live preview screen.
 - Adjustable Focus and Light Metering areas.
 - Configurable Environment setting options to load multiple options at once. Change the entire interface or just change two camera parameters at once.
 - Full In App help.
 - Last but not least

This last the one is the one I'm looking for some help with. For those who want to try out the free version I'd really like to know what non standard features you found in your camera

Any problems I'd really like to know about ASAP. This is version 1.0 so there are probably going to be a few issues with some devices.

This app is for relatively later model Android 4.0 and up devices. It can be a little processor and memory hungry because of the nature of some of the options

Thanks for reading. I'll reply to any questions as soon as I can. I'm located in Aus so keep that in mind if I don't answer a question for a while.

But I really found a niche for Markers at a kids' birthday party last year. For some reason, and I treat them with the same respect I treat adults (e.g. if they talk, I listen). And of course when the smartphone comes out, they all think it's a toy and want to play a game on it. I only have boring adult puzzle games like Shortyz, so I ""made"" a game.

Here's what I do: I let the kid take a picture of something, and I let them draw whatever they want on it. I will then email the drawing to the parents. They can use it as a tablet/PC wallpaper, print it out, whatever, it's up to them. Of course they probably get a print, because I tell the kid that's one thing they can do with their drawing.

[This](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adhyet.Pipe_Down) is an app I made during the previous weekend. 

Every time an audio jack is inserted

This app has a service called Headset Monitor. This service runs in the background and ""monitors"" the headset phone jack. You have the option of setting to run this service every time the device starts.

This app comes from a personal need. I listen to music in my car by connecting the headphone output to the car audio's auxiliary input. I have to keep the media volume on the phone at a high level for the music to be audible through the car system. Later

Also if you can come up with a better name that would be great.

At the moment it does most things fairly well - but you can't create playlists and there is no enqueue function


Thanks!


Another Music Player

EDIT-

I've published the app now (free)

Keep bringing the suggestions

Disclaimer: I may not be capable of delivering the best music playing app ever. (I'm a civil engineer) 


Link updated ^^

But here's another.. 


[Play Store Link (Free)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=another.music.player)


EDIT 2 -  Maybe I'll keep the name..?

EDIT 3 - Just confirmed not working on HTC Desire HD.. I tested it on someones phone at work. I'll fix this ASAP.

EDIT 4 - So it's crashing on a certain screen size, so that updating isn't too frequent..

EDIT 5 - Fixed the crashing


By the way.. Tell your friends too!!

EDIT 6:

So I've compiled a bit of a list

To do list (in no particular order)

1. Fix album art stretched on larger screens (vertically).

2. Add enqueue feature

3. Editable/renamable/creatable playlists

4. Make google play playlists compatible

5. Fix notification controls for all versions (none in API 2.x)

6. Check out lockscreen controls and see which versions support them

7. MP3 tag editing

8. Album art downloading

9. More persistent caching for images

10. Fix the now playing/widget bitmaps from going to default whenever service is dead

11. Check gapless and ensure it's working properly

12. Fix bug where service pauses momentarily when screen is unlocked

13. Add a stop button &amp; cancel notification button where possible

14. Add landscape Mode

15. Support tablet screens

16. Add File/folder browsing

17. Put the widget text above the controls rather than below.

18. Sort out force close when scrolling in album list (occured on 2.3.7)

19. ""Genius"" type automatically generated playlists

20. Recently added list

21. Sort artists by Artist Album (or add category)

22. Add genres category

23. Check fit on Xperia mini pro &amp; simlar screen sizes (seekBar out of view)

24. Add a 4 x 2 widget &amp; include shuffle &amp; repeat

25. Notification/lockscreen controls on droid x (and similar phones/apis)

26. Change the viewpager tab strip to a ""less distracting"" colour

27. Improve the icon?

28. Media volume control throughout the app

29. Make sure lockscreen controls are removed once service is dead.

30. More!",self,t5_2reen,1352695560.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/12u6dx/i_created_a_music_player_app_another_music_player/

Background:
I'm a senior bioinformatics student who sleeps on demand.  My week consists of 20 school hours, 5 hours with my professors, and any spare time with my wife and son.

I want to sleep 12-14 hours a day.  I'm almost impossible to get up.  I started using [sleepyti.me](http://sleepyti.me) around a month ago.  It thoroughly improved my sleep habits and feeling during the day.  I wanted an Android App that set alarms based on these cycles.  I rely heavily on the ""I am going to sleep now button

I decided to create my own app

I like the Android environment.  I also think if I ever had a decent idea

My Nexus 7 was stolen in Puerto Rico. This device is WiFi only, after contacting Cerberus support, I was assured that sending the ""Start emergency mode"" command would cause emergency mode to be activated next time the device connected to the Cerberus servers. 

Fast-forward 4 months. I have my devices set to snap a photo and email me if the wrong pass code is entered twice. Out of the blue, but there was no way of knowing when the actual image was taken! It could have been taken months ago and just finally connected to WiFi and sent the image along. I immediately logged into Cerberus, but the device was no longer connected. I sent a few more ""start emergency mode"" commands just for good measure, and waited. About a day later also emailed Cerberus support. They confirmed there was no additional info to be gained, but they *were* able to tell me that the tablet had last connected to the Cerberus servers a full 18 hours or so AFTER the image was sent. And this was definitely AFTER I sent the emergency mode commands again! But I never got the emergency mode alerts that should have given me the tablet's location. I followed up with support to find out why my tablet never actually went in to emergency mode even though it clearly connected after sending these commands. But they appear to have stopped responding to me at this point. Or maybe they're still investigating. I'll update this post if I hear back.

**But the moral of the story is**: You never really know how well these applications work until it's too late. As in my case. The tablet SHOULD HAVE sent me it's location as soon as it connected to the Cerberus servers. But it didn't. Twice. And there's no explanation from the developer.

1361877801.0,1995ud,Gainos Fresh Wallpapers - Auto changing wallpapers and Daydream screensaver from the best photos on Flickr,alinium,31,11,22,"Hi guys

I'd like to introduce my app: **Gainos Fresh Wallpapers**. It auto changes your wallpaper with the best photos on Flickr at the interval you choose. It is also one of the handful of apps that comes with Daydream functionality allowing you to view a stream of Flickr's 'Explore' photos with a Ken Burns Effect.


**Features:**

* Images are selected at random from the 'Explore' stream at Flickr (http://www.flickr.com/explore/).
* Remembers last 10 wallpapers so you can go back and choose one you previously liked.
* Choose to change the wallpaper as frequently as 10 minute to as slow as once every week.
* Enable Daydream mode on JellyBean+ devices to start screensaver when device is docked.
* Share images with your social networks.
* Works well with tablets and phones. For high resolution displays a higher quality image is downloaded.
* Choose to download new wallpapers only over wifi to save cellular bandwidth.
* Minimal interface that stays out of your way. Just start the service once and forgot about the app.

We have achieved over 10k downloads in all our apps and are looking for people to test our Alpha Build of our latest creation.


This is free and you don't have to send us any money or such things like that


Please send an email to bfaulds@genbustudios.com I will send you all the necessary information to download the live wallpaper as  well as the promotional code that will be tied to that specific phone only. (Title the subject - Alpha Tester)


We have yet to have any major breakthrough apps and are hoping that we can get some feedback from the community as to what they are wanting.



*Information about the app:*

**Gallery 3D**

&gt; Live wallpaper with multiple themes

&gt; Can use your own photos as your background

&gt; Have the ability to change the settings and functionality of certain features of the app

&gt; Much



Installation notes:
Drag app onto the drive of your phone either via USB or download through the phone's web browser.
After download/getting it on the phone, if through usb, you can navigate to the file through some file explorer (Astro is a free android app that does such). Navigate to the file through your file explorer and install using Package Installer. *Note: You may need to allow installation of non-Market apps in your system settings on your phone*

Enter the promotional code provided in the email that was sent to you and you should be all good. (Setting the live wallpaper should be the same as any other, then set as Wallpaper).


Thank you Reddit and hope that everyone can enjoy our live wallpaper as much as we enjoy making them. =)

- Everything is in ""last added"" chronological order.  What the actual fuck.  It's bad enough that I have to organize everything by playlist (which I don't really use), album, title, or any other meta data.

I have to admit, so I'm hoping other people have had more thorough experiences with them and can recommend something else.

&gt;Great camera app. But, also do NOT download any of their 'apps. They are hidden on your devise. Nasty.

&gt;Read sensitive log data? Does a camera app need that?!

&gt;Look at the permissions. This app can control the phone cam and collect pic/video the can can see ANYTIME. And the sensitive log data? Means it can just collect all the passwords even credit card info that u key into ur phone. *uninstalled",self,t5_2reen,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/135qsd/whats_the_deal_with_camera360_ultimate_lots_of/
1351625084.0,12cq8v,Adblock Plus App is mentioned on the developer's website but is nowhere to be found,mukeke,24,2,6,"I have been looking for an easy solution

Apparently there exists an Android application version of Adblock Plus that can be run with or without root.

Here is the app's official homepage: http://adblockplus.org/en/android-about

Here you can see how to properly configure the application: http://adblockplus.org/en/android-config

I even found a [German news article](http://www.netzwelt.de/news/93152-app-tipp-adblock-plus-android.html) that talks about testing the application on non rooted devices.

The major problem I run into is that the actual application is nowhere to be found. The official homepage mentions that it should be in the Google Play Store. It also says that you can download the apk file from the site to install manually

I find this mildly infuriating. Have any of you guys heard of this application or know why it is nowhere to be found? Any help would be appreciated.

I'd like some feedback/testing for the new version (basically a whole new app).

It features a level-based approach to learning the notes on the treble/bass staff

What do you guys think of the user interface? Is it intuitive? Do you like the playing card approach as opposed to the 3-star system used everywhere?

Since I've only got two devices (Optimus V and Nexus 7)

Do you like the payment model where you get the core of the app for free but can pay to use specific features?

This is a fun little silly game that has you popping colorful pigs so you can harvest the sweet bacon found within!

**The Basics** 

Bouncing pigs are coming at you

Each pig adds to the Bacon Meter

If the Bacon Meter is full, you lose. 

Hit the pigs on the first try and don't let any get past to build a high combo

Don't pop the bomb pigs

___

As mentioned before, which will also have access to DLC, which will be free cosmetic changes (like hats for pigs and new backgrounds)

The app is tiny (73k) and requires no funky permissions.

Well
The reasons I am posting this are:
1)  I was excited about the app and wanted honest feedback.
2)  The science community here is great and I thought it would help people keep interest in science. (keep knowledge available!)
3)  I love this website!

It is a social locations sharing application

**Features:**

*  Users can Tag locations and leave a message
*  View Tags that were created by friends
*  View Tags for locations that are close to your current location from any user
*  Has a Locator service that when enable will allow your friends to see your current location in real-time.
*  View friends location in real-time if they have the Location service running.
*  Invite friends via SMS

**Things I plan to add:**

* Allow users to add photos/video to Tags
* Allow users to invite other users to their friends list
* Allow users to filter location list by category when creating a Tag
