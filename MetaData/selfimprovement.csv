I remember my Dad pointing to a breadcrumb on the table and saying there are millions of atoms in the smallest crumb I could see

He was always passionate about something from the way other drivers obeyed the rules of the road to perceived slights to his authority. His anger came out in everything he did. 

-He framed a closet in our first house. Something upset him and he threw a 2x4 through the newly hung sheetrock. 

-My mother upset him over something. He had her on the couch choking her until I came up and slapping him said in my best 5 year old anger to not hurt my mommy. He stormed out and drove away.
 
-From my earliest memories,. He always took turns very fast, passed people uphill on two lane roads in the dark, around corners. The road between his parents’ house and where we lived invariably went through Noel Missouri. This road was two lanes, carved into the side of very steep cliffs, always at night, always hilly, possibly 5 years old

-Responding to what he rightly perceived as me bullying my younger brother

-After telling me I couldn't string Christmas lights in the bookshelf

-My Dad said he had mentioned he wanted me to sweep the leaves off the cement back porch. I had never been tasked with this before and did not do it. At 11pm I was woken up by my Dad whipping me across my back

-He didn't want the next door construction site to use our water, this left him with an index finger with a bit of the wire sticking out the tip constantly pointing. In a bar he became upset with someone and punched them with that hand. 12 years old, Louisville.

-I was failing multiplication and had a skewed view of the importance of math at the time I was 11. My Dad whipped me

-My parents fought a lot. I was never able to discern who started or caused it. However my Dad became angry easily and often. At night I would hear them screaming at each other. It made my stomach hurt. I tried the hide under a blanket thing like I did when he drove but it didn’t help there either. 

-My mother had just made dinner and brought it to the table. Dinner was often uncomfortable when Dad was angry. Whatever it was that angered him I have forgotten. I am sure it was a disagreement with my Mom. He picked up a ceramic bowl holding the scrambled eggs Mom had made and threw it across the room at a high rate of speed. It exploded like a bomb, Lousiville. 

-He became angry at his girlfriend who he had slept with while married to my mother and his best friend’s wife and while driving punched out the windshield of the car (actually got his hand all the way through the glass)

-My next youngest brother were in a canoe side by side with my Dad and youngest brother on a small river float trip. The sun was behind my Dad

-While returning from a New Year’s eve party with his nieces, he put me in a headlock in front of everyone. No one stopped him from choking me, he eventually loosened his hold but maintained the headlock for 20 minutes or so. When I escaped crying I ran outside into the night and promptly got lost for 2 hours in the unfamiliar neighborhood. Returning I found my father asleep on his host nieces bed with his pants around his knees. He had urinated on her bed then fell asleep on the same bed.

-When driving back with my Dad from the funeral for his mother (Oklahoma to New York state), I called from a payphone, she wasn’t home. I returned to the car to say I would just continue with him back to the house. He became angry and peeled out of the gas station, shifting from 1st to 3rd before we were out of the parking lot. We had his 17 year old pregnant stepdaughter and her boyfriend in the car as well. I asked him to please let the kids out then he and I could accelerate into a bridge as far as I was concerned. Or he could stop, or he could talk about his feelings, or any fucking thing else but he was going to let the kids out right fucking now, however the fuck he chose to go about it. He did slow down. An hour later

-Getting whipped by my Dad was made up of a few steps. One I was made aware it was coming usually. Two he was very angry and scared me with the overt hostility on his face before he touched me. Three he would grab me by a wrist and pick me up in the air. Four he would unbuckle his heavy leather belt with one hand pulling it quickly through the loops. The sound is distinctive. Five he would begin striking me with the belt typically between the middle of my back and my knees. Sometime with clothes on

-Being struck by my Dad would usually include an open hand or whatever he was holding at the moment. This was usually a knee jerk reaction due to how he perceived my insult/ignorance/lack of attention. Typically would number less than 10 strikes

These are significant pieces of my past that shaped the person I am. The distance I have come from the delusion this is normal to semi lucidity is huge.  I have had to redefine myself so many times I have lost count. There are parts of my past I emulated these behaviors

I am always angry, every single day of my life. Some of it helped me when I had to work through tough times while in the military or in the war on everything my twenties and thirties became. Rage was a huge asset then. It has taken a large portion of my life. I don’t trust or respect authority. When I do react to authority, I have to fight the urge to cower to them or undiluted hostility with no grey areas. I am bad at relationships. I am hyper sexual. I am hyper aware of my surroundings, other peoples moods, unable to relax and get drunk in public or just hang out with a group without identifying the first person/threat I will mitigate if the situation merits it. 

I am angry with how he treated me and the effects it had on my life. I am angry how he hurt my brothers

This began as a list of things I remembered. I don't know what it is now. But it needed to be written down once. I have been diagnosed with PTSD. I will not be surprised if during treatment it was due to this man. 

These are things that came to mind over a day and a half between tasks at work. I am positive there were many more. I have no idea where

I am not seeking pity and have coping skills now

Thanks for reading my wall of nonsense.

1358650315.0,16wrm2,The eye opener - my story and what has been working for me. ,lexington_steel,71,11,10,"SelfImprovement, but I'm motivated now. 



I originally decided to organize the reddits I was subscribed to in order to make my life just that, politics, pics, etc) and started browsing around for things I knew I would love to see that would make me enjoy spending my time on the internet(ex: movies, TIL, Bestof, etc). 



I found something on /r/QuotesPorn that legitimately changed how I viewed life. Let me tell you something



""Someone once told me the definition of Hell: The last day you have on Earth




That quote went deep for me. It made me realize I was depressed and that I wasn't living life, but fuck, I feel so good being on my feet for five hours a day and I find myself thankful that sitting down is now the best part of the day instead of the only part of the day. I'm slowly becoming more social and I was walking home from work yesterday afternoon and I had the biggest grin on my face because I realized that I was getting better and that my life just started to click. I can honestly say that it was the best feeling I've ever had.  




Anyway, it is personal or something. 



1)Recognize all the negative impacts in your life and be thankful for them. All the asshole roommates, bosses, whatever. They've given you more character than you could ever imagine. Those fights where you really had to stick to your moral guns have given you character. They've tested your metal and you've survived. After those encounters you realize what you want in all of your relationships – personal, professional, romantic. Because you know what you want now, you can search for it and attain it. You can now confidently say what you like and you know how to defend it.



2)Be Humble. You're no better than anyone and no one is better than you. This is always true. You don't get to decide who is better or worse than you. Life treats everyone equally



3)Let the journey happen. Don't get caught up in the big picture as you'll end up painting it no matter what.  The little things are what make life worth living. The three in the morning coffee from a diner with friends. The five minute conversations on the bus, before class, are all worth it. Your scars, crooked smile, and little imperfections aren't imperfections at all, they're what make you perfect.



4)Talk to everyone. Fucking everyone. Those five minute conversations? They really are worth it. People aren't scary and not everyone is going to try to murder you for asking how their day was or for seeing if they are enjoying the weather. I think a good example of this is something that happened to me the other day. I was waiting for the bus and someone came up. I asked him “What's your major?” He says “Marketing.” and looks at me like I should ask another question. I just say “that's all I had man.” and we start laughing about the single question and then he asks me about my major and he replies to me with the same. 



5)Find what you enjoy and fucking immerse yourself into it. Hobbies are pretty killer and help keep it real. No one will have time to judge you if you're passionate about something. If you can talk about something with passion, everyone is passionate about something. That alone connects everyone.



That depression I mentioned earlier? It is still there and I'm still working on it. I hope one day it falls into just memories of things I'm thankful for



That's all I have for you. I'd like to thank one of my friends for inspiring me to write this up. Without him saying “we need more lexington_steel's in the world” I would have been an asshole and kept this wealth of information to myself.

1363331788.0,1ac7jy,My complete lack of self-control is ruining my life. How do you improve on such a fundamental flaw?,wheelslip,59,5,36,"Ever since moving back home after graduating from college (9 months ago) I've been in a terrible rut. I need to find a job, I spend most of the day on the internet doing nothing productive. I'm probably being about 5% as productive as I could be

The thing is, I'd probably tell them to take their goals more seriously, break them up into manageable chunks, record their progress, etc. I know all that. What I don't know is how to control myself in the moment and resist the temptation to just go on YouTube or Reddit instead of doing something productive. 

Let me take you through a typical day. I set my alarm for 9:00 AM, then take a shower where I vow to do some serious job-hunting, eat right, etc. It all seems so easy and attainable at this point. Then I go straight to the computer where I'll surely do something productive, but first, let's check the news, and maybe some tech sites, I know in the back of my mind that I need to be doing other things, so that I don't make my sleeping habits even worse, how the future is so uncertain

As you might have guessed, I'd like to think that I'll do some programming, apply to some jobs, stick to my diet, and do all the right things, but I know my state of mind too well to be that naive. How on earth do you solve a problem as fundamental as poor self-control? How do you break a daily cycle like this when you have the weight of a hundred failed days behind you to break your confidence in succeeding? 

tl;dr: How does one tackle the problem of poor self-control? 


EDIT: Thanks everyone for the great advice! I didn't expect so much. My friend needed me to help him with his house today (which was a great change of scenery and really lifted my spirits) but that's why I didn't get a chance to read and respond to everything. I will do that tomorrow and maybe compile a list of the main ideas brought up here


**2 months later EDIT:**

I'm not sure if anyone will come across this post anymore, and going to the gym. I've been doing this for the past month. I haven't lost any weight, but I haven't gained any either, so that's good. More importantly, running has helped even out my mood throughout the day and I just generally feel better for doing it. I also dug up an old programming project I was working on and have been working on that for a few weeks. The biggest news, however, is that exactly a year since graduating college, but it's a pretty good job with good pay

Overall, but these things are always hazy in retrospect. I did notice that starting a good habit takes alot of initial energy, but once you get going, it gets easier and easier. I also was suffering from the mentality that my real life hadn't started yet and I needed to improve myself in all these ways in order for it to begin. That's a horrible and destructive way to think, because you imagine yourself in a prison and can become consumed by helplessness and despair. Embracing the present and its flaws put me in a much healthier and more productive state of mind, where I was not too overwhelmed to make real changes.

Therefore

The next step for this to become a reality are as follows:

1.	Garner enough interest among the Reddit community to choose a name for the publication
2.	Open up submissions for self improvement topics, diet, and a variety of others
3.	Create the first issue with Reddit contributors (designers and content providers)
4.	Start a Kickstarter project to raise money for the first printing
5.	Print and promote

I grew up in a single parent home as an only child. I saw both my parents but being raised by my mom who never really dated, left me with just about nothing to imitate as far as relationships, I also had several friends with split families and some with normal marriages. 

So seeing as I've pretty much had to learn everything on my own by trial and error. This area has never been very easy for me. As a result I've developed some insecurities

So

I've always been insecure, so they wanted to move me up a grade, so I went to a second grade class and at that age even a year age difference makes everyone seem eons older. So I ended up bitching out of the class and staying in first grade. Then when I went to second grade I had the same teacher and in that class was this kid was was still there because he got held back and I guess he remembered me from I got pushed up and I guess he felt threatened by me or something. Anyways, he didn't pick on me much then but that's when stuff started. Then in 3rd grade a bunch of random kids in my class really started to lay in to me and I honestly can't remember why. But they messed with me all year and that was probably the start of much of my problems in the head. I eventually started going to see a family counselor because as nice as my mom was she didn't know how to deal with everything. I still go see him once in awhile these days and I've talked to him about my problems too. So being tormented early on caused me to just retreat and hide away and always made me shy towards people and women too. And ever since I've always had these terrible anxieties about people. Even though I stand 5'11 and 160lbs. I feel at times that people just stare at me every where I go and that everyone is judging me and looking down on me, or like everyone can see all my deep dark secrets, it's not every where but being in public can be very gut wrenching at times. Not that I'm a shut in but I worry way too much about people around me

This ties in to anxiety. I really worry way too damn much about what people think about me, my best friends, anything. Not that I do everything to impress, but lately I find I can't have fun with some of my most treasured hobbies and free time activities because for some shitty reason I worry too much about how someone might think about me doing said activity. Kind of a split mindset inside. I don't want to turn in to an asshole and just forget at all about considering others but I am definitely not considering others in a good extent. This anxiety has been so bad that it rubs off on my relationship mind sets as well, maybe I'm more shallow then I'd like to admit or maybe watching too much porn has warped my mind but there have been some instances where I have turned down women who I actually found attractive and had great personalities, the kind of girls I would easily go with and could be happy, just because I have this horrible deep fear that people will judge me because that person doesn't meet their standards of attractiveness or standards or personality and that's horrible. I shouldn't at all worry about that. In those cases, when I come out to my friends about something I think they would judge me for

The last thing is the inferiority complex. With all this avoiding stuff and thinking too much about others, i've started to view pleasing myself in anyways as bad. ie: ""oh i like this, or ive done this thing I think is good but there's probably someone out there who has a negative opinion towards what ever this thing is so I shouldn't feel happy about it""

That's stupid, we all accept each other for the way we are and that's that.

That's all I have right now but maybe others can relate. Good luck to anyone else trying to improve",self,t5_2qmbm,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/156xch/just_found_this_ive_recently_really_been_focusing/

Up until high school I would spend Sunday-Thursday studying, almost two decades of this before they began to ease up has really worn down my self esteem.

Whenever I try to do things

A few months ago, and it eventually got to the point that we completely stopped talking. Having pushed away someone who was once my best friend has made me realize that I really need to change.

It seems like this all stems from that low self-esteem. My thoughts that I am not good enough cause me to cling for validation. I get paranoid that people hate me and avoid me, I'm unable to trust my friends on these topics and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy of sorts.

I'm really not sure how to deal with this. It's not like learning a form of math or other academic subject

* Eat healthy - You are what you eat, fruit but spare the carbohydrates

* Exercise - It does not have to be a gym

* Dress well - You want to look like the person you are or want to be. Looks are

* Read - Be it a newspaper

* Sleep well - This means sleeping enough

**Intermediate**

* Meditate - By no means necessary but very good for your mind. It will literally change your brain.

* Voice training - It is much more enjoyable to listen to a nice voice, that is a matter of its own.

* Time management - Your day only has so many minutes

* Assess yourself - That means tracking how well you do, miles you run or whatever.

* Learn to cook - It may be nice to make noodles or something

1351218930.0,123qiz,I ditched some terrible people and influences and have nearly completely changed my life around. ,,20,1,10,"Hi Reddit. There is a TL;DR.

I play the guitar. Religiously - as if my life depended on it. My best friend for a decade introduced me to the instrument and it is as important to me as breathing or as smooching my girlfriend. I need to play guitar. I need to be creative. It is the most viciously passionate thing about me. 

A year ago I released an album that did as poorly as could be; but with the help of this decade long friendship. Recently, started using pot again and not just recreationally. Full blown addiction? Yeah - in the way that he is self-medicating. I tried to reach out, tried to be there for him for months at a time, and finally decided I'll jsut talk to him in six months. It turns out he was talking about me behind my back to other friends asking them if they think my dream and goal of being a famous instrumental virtuostic guitar player is unrealistic, putting seeds of doubt in them too about my career path. 

They all go to school studying things that don't make them feel anywhere NEAR as passionate as I am about the guitar; but they think they are better than me even so. 

So I decided to abandon this friend. Because really? He did the same thing to me a few years ago. Six to eight months of no contact. And this was during one of the worst times in my life. Thankfully my psychiatrist was a great one and I'll never forget how she helped me overcome my obstacles in life at the time.

Anyhow. 

So I got rid of that relationship; at least for the time being. Then out of no where another friend of mine starts speaking to me as if he is disciplining me on being 'financially stable' and having a 'backup plan' and being 'smart' about things. This is a person who goes to business school. He has been in debt for the better part of 4 years. He knows only about money it seems; as he tried guitar and ended up pawning off all his gear to buy the next big purchase. 

I realized then that the friends I had made

So I dumped his ass too. I don't hate him

At this point in my career; where I still had those two friends

THEN I SAID FUCK IT ALL. HOW DARE MY FRIENDS MAKE ME FEEL NEGATIVE ABOUT MY CAREER CHOICE.

I got viciously passionate again. I rediscovered who; and how I am. And now? I have a potential deal for my 2nd album

Victory is mine

All I had to do was change my affiliations and relationships and to focus on myself. That $13

Alt F forward.

TL;DR: I ditched some negative friends and have opened so many doors for happiness it's unbelievable. ",self,t5_2qmbm,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/123qiz/i_ditched_some_terrible_people_and_influences_and/

Some of the famous

There is a substantial body of literature and essays written in defense of idleness. Other famous authors have written about our right to be lazy and the benefits we should expect from being idle.

Examples include:

Aristole
Robert Louis Stevenson
DH Lawrence
Bertrand Russell
Arthur Conan Doyle
Soren Kierkegaard
Lord Byron
Victor Hugo
Jerome K. Jerome
Tom Petty
Dr. Samuel Johnson
Robert Burton
Henry David Thoreau
Paul Lafargue.

...and many

Our current societal construct despises idleness. I think this stem from the fact that in the global economy you must either produce or consume. If you do neither the assumption is that you must be doing something bad or wrong.

I've have been introducing increasing amounts of idle time into my week and have noticed a number of benefits.

Actually, and have been for the last two years since being diagnosed with a brain aneurysm. That event straight-up blasted every spiritual/religious pillar I had been carrying and sent me down a dark path that badly messed me up. I moved to another town, wrote off most of my friends, and spent most of the time not eating and living in depression and solitude.

Before I get into my present situation, a cheater, the opposite of the sort I'd prefer to be around. But I was just so tired of being alone that I allowed myself a lapse in judgment, if only for a few weeks. That was last year. There's been nothing else, before or since.

What I tell myself is that I have very modest standards and, paranoid, sloppy - so where do I get off thinking I'm better? I'm exceedingly-average in the looks department, I'm too thin, I'm short, I don't know how to dress nicely and I can be a social ape at times.

And now I'm getting off track, bitter, pessimistic husk of a man - and the worst part is that I truly believe these thoughts I have that it doesn't matter how happy I am, it doesn't matter if I die alone or in someone's arms, it doesn't matter if any of my dreams come true. Yes, it's that bad.

Thinking back on the whole ordeal, ""You're an idiot! You tried to go up against three frat boys in the middle of a party. You're lucky you didn't get seriously hurt."" 

I'm trying to process everything that happened, you've proved yourself superior. I'm considered a sweet personable guy, a good guy, but I'm very aware that there is this dark wolf inside me that would have torn that guys ear off. This is a terribly destructive and pernicious mentality that will one day get me in a whole lot of trouble. I guess this fight made me fully aware that that aspect of my personality, despite my best efforts, is still ever-present, and that a lot of my insecurities about feeling inferior haven't been dealt with. Have all my efforts to escape the shy skinny kid perception, been fueled by insecurity and are therefore fruitless? How can I even begin to deal with these demons?

Thanks for listening. I don't really know what I want from this or if you guys can offer me any advice

* the anticipation of social events triggers anxiety and restlessness
* and to deal with that
* I lose focus when reading
* I get overly excited on technical stuff

I wish to correct all these four issues. I'd like to know your opinion over such behavior

Here's an elaborated version. It took me five rewrites to write it coherently - thank you if you took the time to read it!

I was doing dishes this morning, swipe, wash, dry, store, repeat. I am doing dishes. Repeat. [...] I am doing dishes because I have to keep myself busy. I have to keep myself busy so I'll have a good reason to be tired. If I'm tired, I can postpone talking to A. (A is some chick I exchanged a few messages with on some dating site - I do this sort of regulary, but I was always a bit drunk and invested time into replying with something witty and smartass. Asked for IM, so that's why I've been cleaning and doing chores and watching TV.

Now, or getting restless before an event.
At this point I stopped doing housework, which - sure enough, went away, only to reveal how I escape from said anxiety - video games, watching tv, house chores, surrounding myself with work.

Reading and learning about various topics is how I always spend my free time. The thoughts progressed and it dawned to me that another escape strategy is a clicking binge on Wikipedia, finding the original reference, and repeating. It happens quite a lot during said escape pattern, and I retain close to no information from my material. And there's another pattern too - any interesting scenario will suddenly have me daydreaming into it (can you say mental masturbation?), thinking outcomes, sometimes even having imaginary dialogues out loud.

And this leads on to another form of escapism - one through work. I find something interesting, with mixed results (I have a prototype for a browser based game I made around 17, I turned a complete chess set by hand, I designed and manufactured a part of my furniture, I wrote various software for all sorts of sillinesses, which was later abandoned). I find myself much more susceptible to this sort of behavior if I'm going through sleep deprivation or lack of sleep. This looks uncomfortably close to mania.

I believe all these issues are somehow connected, and maybe even lead me to more insight.

Needless to say, yet only today I noticed them.",,False,self,t5_2qmbm,False,,

I'm having trouble with social opportunities in my daily life. I'm not a social outcast or someone who is lacking friends by any stretch. I'm just aware of a certain facet of myself
  
I'll start with the very basics. I'm a 22 year old guy who is currently enrolled in a university to the south of me. Before I locked into a university
  
I think living in the city and practising seduction has taught me a lot. Before I started learning how to efficiently convince women to go home with me(I've slowed down on that skillset now, where back in high school I spent hours in my darkened basement seated in front of a small TV with a controller in my hand. Around this time, I started shallowly pursuing psychology to explain the unfamiliar world around me. Behaviorial psychology snagged me like a branch and I continued to learn about it as I got older.  
  
After awhile, those stories are not the norm but the exception and should be heavily disregarded.   
  
This has led me to doubt a lot of role models. People like Tiger Woods, and if the right situation presents itself, people will do irrational and often destructive shit. How can you trust someone or learn from someone like Woods knowing what they did? I feel life experiences and everything we do is not a singled-out mutually-exclusive event; what we do, we apply to other parts in our life. If you want to learn golf from Woods, how can you be sure that his teachings would be trustworthy then?  
  
This perspective has also led me to focus discipline more lightly. I want to change some really exhausted habits of mine but I often roll back into them

I imagine it's because I feel more comfortable around my parents and allow myself to emote freely

Now this wouldn't be a problem if I could just contain my emotions like an adult, I swear at really inappropriate people, I start crying hysterically if things aren't going my way in the argument. I'm basically like a child throwing a tantrum.

My mom pointed out how bad it was getting a couple days ago, but having my mom actually sit me down as an adult to tell me I need to work on this was a real wake up call. I decided I was going to consciously control my temper. Today, I had to call my landlord to make sure he was sending my deposit back and he rattled off a list of (mostly bullshit) charges he was deducting from my deposit. I pretty much flipped a shit, and probably embarrassingly tried to argue with him. I barely even remember it now, and when I think about it calmly I realize there's no reason to freak out, and yet even though I was consciously trying to control myself I was unable to. The second I start getting angry it takes over my reasoning skills and I don't know what to do about it. 

I've never talked to anyone is real life about this issue except my mother who had no advice to give

TLDR: I'm usually pretty mild but when I get angry I'm like Mugatu on crack.

One day, ""What do I want for myself in this life?"", ""Where do I wish to be?"". He looked around at the farm he had known his whole life and the beautiful jade landscape unfolding around him and said to himself, ""I'll become a jade master.""

He knew there was a jade master that lived on a small precipice on the opposite side of the large hill under which he lived. He set out climbing up the hill and then down and around to front door of the jade masters home. As he knocked the door swung open and he was greeted by a small smiling man. The mans smile so radiant that no one could have challenged it

""I want to be a jade master, why else would you journey here but to learn from a master."" The farmer shuffled uncomfortably into The Jade Masters abode. A jade home for a jade master, the boy thought to himself as he looked around. The walls were painted a deap teal and all the upholstery was purely jade. As the boy walked deeper into the house the Jade Master taps him on the shoulder and hands him a peice of Jade. 

""Take this Jade, passes it to the boy and says ""Please sweep the floors."" The farmer, angered by this, says ""I came here to never sweep again. I came to learn the way of Jade and too become master."" ""Too become the master you must listen to your master."" The boy so angry with this idea of sweeping, leaves the Jade Masters home and returns to his farm. Once again though, he finds himself sweeping for his parents. Saddened by his own lack of commitment he returns to the Jade Master and becomes content with the idea of sweeping for himself.

When he returned to the Jade Master, and I will do all it takes."" The Jade Master once again handed the boy a piece of Jade and a broom and told him to sweep the floors. Dutifully, the farmer began to sweep. Each day that he returned to the Master, he would have a piece of Jade in his hand and he would sweep the floors. This continued for a few months. The farmer queried the Master often on when he would start his training with Jade and the Master would reply ""You've already begun."" 

One day the farmer entered the home and was handed his broom and the Jade put in his hand, looked at the farmer and said, ""You are correct, this is not Jade."" The Jade Master walked to the front door, opened it and started to leave. The farmer exclaimed ""Where are you going, Master? What do I do now?"" The master looks at him and says, ""You wait for the next pupil."" The farmer smiled.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1dixcs/the_jade_master/

Have you ever looked at something that you see every day and realized that you never really saw it before? I do this with people.

Today I saw people that I see all the time in a different way. I appreciated them more. I felt a level of deep respect and love for them that I could not feel just a short time ago.

**They haven’t changed. The change is in me.**

I know this is directly related to opening my heart more. It’s not easy for me to do

There are many layers to who we are and most of them are relatively false. Habits and personality are like a layer of cheap paint that hides the beauty that is inside.

I'm sitting here at work and I'm bored. I've done all of the work around here that needs doing and now I'm just waiting on customers. My job here is at a gas station, and do the paperwork to close up at night. This morning I went into my first job, which is monitoring the computer labs at school. I do that for a couple of hours, from 8am to 10am, and then head to my one class for the day until 11am. I go home and take care of my dog, read, go for a walk, finish homework

I am a busy person, I've finished reading more books than I ever have before, I've lost weight in the past couple of years, I wake up early and work late, my room is clean, I put in the extra effort to do little things to improve my life. I even have hobbies like brewing beer.

Up until a couple of years ago all I ever did was do drugs and sit around watching television so my life now is a big improvement for me. I am a very busy person but notice that I use the word 'busy.' I don't feel like I'm actually getting anything done. Sure I'm doing jobs that people will pay for someone to do and I'm doing well in school

I think I may be obsessed with winning the lottery. This all started a couple months ago when I found out my parents were getting a divorce. I thought it was no big deal at the time, and I had no real desire to, seeing as I knew the odds of winning the lottery and it seemed like a waste of money. For the last month, I’ve spent almost $20 a week on lottery tickets that all turn out to be losers. After checking the numbers online, I just rip up all my tickets and go to bed disappointed until I buy more tickets the next day and that excited “I could win” feeling returns. I’ve become so obsessed with winning that I always fantasize about what I would do with the money, how I would leave my house and not go back to my parents again until they got their divorce sorted out, and how I would just reinvent myself.

At this point

First, you'll have a better idea of what new habits to adopt. Being happy is crucial to self improvement. 

Second, however, that you don't need to live up to others' expectations. 

Third, so this is a good way to see what people enjoy being around. If you enjoy being around well-read people, then maybe reading more is a good way to improve how you feel about yourself. If manners and politeness are good qualities in others, they'll probably reflect positively on yourself too.

But I am posting what I posted in /r/selfhelp here since I did not get any responses for several days now and would like to see if I can get some response here):

In my previous posts in /r/socialanxiety and /r/socialskills

This made me think about elitism and exclusivity. I am often bothered by the fact that sometimes groups or people categorize others as ""wannabe"" whatever or ""oh,w,x,y,z and you're calling yourself X?"" (Essentially, a condescending tone which denounces others for not being a ""hardcore"" or ""pure"" (or following rigid standards of what X is). Also, some people try to one-up each other in order to ""prove"" their identity.

So often

From my impression, ""self fulfillment"". Also, I believe that in general, people have a natural tendency to think more about themselves than others.

Additionally (as a side note), when no one could give a fuck anyway.

In a way, as it is a negative trait that does not really benefit anyone in the long run.

So...

**How do you develop a sense of identity and belonging without the need for thinking you're better than someone and/or being self-centered?**

**How do you balance the idea of accepting yourself as ""you""

**I understand that by constructing a label (I am me. I like ___.), to some extent, subscribe to certain qualities. I guess a solution is to think that everyone is unique, and has their own experiences and upbringing, and therefore, no one has the right to categorize you as whatever...but I guess I am still not satisfied unless I could somehow develop a ""self-sustaining"" identity.**",,self,,

I find growing up to where I am now I've always had ideas that were ""outside the box"" and I have recently taken my old love for role playing games to DM a few games for my young kids.   This has tapped me back into my imagination and creating worlds and situations and characters.  I enjoy this greatly.

While on my last vacation I was talking to the wife how I could come up with ideas that I think could rival book and movie worlds such as harry potter and the matrix.  Putting me on the spot she challenged me to do it.   After being taken aback I stopped and shortly returned with 3 broad senarios of ""worlds"" and brief ""storylines"" without actually fleshing out major characters.  She had to concede that she had not heard of them before and they each had merrit.  (I will not type them here as I dont know what I will do with the ideas)

I have recently took over this subreddit and made changes to the overall look

The vision I have for this subreddit would be a place to share and discuss information that would improve the mindset of everyone and help people grow into becoming a person with a prosperity mindset (whether money is your purpose or not), and passionate drive in life.

Since the subreddit is still relatively small

I am currently working alone behind the scenes and I am looking for candidates to be moderators in promoting, any suggestions or feedback to help grow this subreddit is welcome.

Currently, [RELATIONSHIPS],** etc. in front of posts to help categorise posts (with self improvement being a broad subject). This is still an evolving concept and there is no obligation to do so, however, it is encouraged.

My question is half relationship

I've been dating this girl for a little over two months now (not including the time apart over this christmas break). We've known each other since freshman year and while she's got a great personality and traits I slowly found myself liking her  a lot more than she likes me. Or so I thought. The thing is it's always me asking her when she's free over the weekend or if she wants to do something ""alone together"". While we are together and  I sleep over her dorm occasionally on weekends we always hang out in a group setting. I've been feeling like I want her to want me. Now all my past relationships were in high school but whenever I've been in a relationship I've always wanted to spend time with that person whenever possible. I'd wonder what they were doing as I wrote a paper or etc. She doesn't seem to do that. And it's great because it means she's not dependent on people which leads me to my next problem. 

I feel like I may be too emotionally dependent. I'm not sure if I'm being needy because I'm unhappy being separated for so long over break and she rarely PMs or calls me. And I wouldn't be as bothered if she did this to everyone but she's been having a conversation with her ex boyfriend

When she's got sick I bought her a card and some chocolates. I just feel like she hasn't shown any commitment to this relationship and that hurts. But then again maybe I'm at fault because recently I've joined this forum and I realized I have little self worth and I read this article and figured I might be emotional dependent. http://www.innerbonding.com/show-article/2449/healing-emotional-dependency.html

Ugh

I had considered breaking up with her after talking to a buddy but I don't know if I want to do that. I also don't want to stay in a relationship though because I fear being alone. I also don't want to break up early and realize I made a mistake and I'm a goof.

Any advice would be much obliged. Thanks.

I need to learn how to make my voice sound kinder, my father is a wonderful man. I, on the other hand, feel like I'm a far cry from what I could and should be. It's holding me back in so many areas of my life and it's starting to get to a boiling point. When I think I'm speaking normally, people have told me I'm being rough, rude, abrasive or even borderline shouting. I know it's not up to me what other's think of me and after hearing so much negative feedback I realize I need to bring about some changes. 

I feel like it's not just my tone of voice

If there's someone out there who could point me in the right direction, potentially my job) and I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. I'm prepared to accept the reality that I have more serious personality flaws, too, and I want to find them and work them out. Would anyone here know if there's any specific kind of therapy that could help me? Can anyone discern anything from the way I wrote this and point me in the right direction? Is there another subreddit I should crosspost to? I'm baring it all and I'm ready to say, I need help.

And I know that this may be premature/overreaching/assuming

I just moved to Pennsylvania from Colorado last week

For me, the first thing that person is gonna notice is how I look. And in the edges of Philadelphia, where people with less-than-benign intentions aren't exactly uncommon, an overweight college student with messy hair isn't exactly going to provide the best image. Now, I like to think I'm a pretty alright person, but I'm also pretty sure my results may vary. Plus, I don't know if the kind of people I'm looking for are the kinds of people who would respond well to that. I get along better with introverted, nerds.

Now, but the only one I'm really interested in only meets during one of my classes (evening class on Wednesdays FTL), and while I signed up to attend meetings for a couple others, it's not with very high hopes.

Are You Living In The Moment?


Written by Steven Griggs | stevengriggs.com

“Do not dwell in the past

“I know that the purpose of life is to understand and be in the present moment with the people you love. It's just that simple.”                                                         Jane Seymour
 
We’ve all been advised by well meaning friends who tell us: “You must learn to be present “

This is absolutely correct and being reminded is a good thing but usually the person “advising” us

It sounds good and I’m sure they mean well but if you are telling other people what to do or how they should conduct their lives you are probably not really “living in the moment” yourself. You are coming from a place that may be a bit tinged by ego.

Living in the present is not easy

Our culture actually leads us in the opposite direction. We find ourselves either day dreaming of the future or reminiscing about the past.

When I say reminiscing I am being generous because usually when we look back it is not generally with a warm, not looking back with satisfaction and acceptance.

And daydreaming about the future is a handy way for our ego mind to assuage itself and vicariously taste the future without actually having to make the effort or take the action needed to make it happen.

Some may say they are not daydreaming or reminiscing but that is not necessarily living in the present. You may find that you are just cruising along on autopilot. Looking out at the world from the safe

Living in the present is not automatic. It takes practice.

It is the conscious, at this very moment, and keeping that feeling as long as you can.

It is paying attention.

Being here.

Right now.

It is the focused attention you put on your friend’s face as they are telling you about something that happened to them or some important issue that they are dealing with. It is listening with all your senses. It means turning your phone off and putting it away.

It means really hearing the words they are saying and diving deeper into the emotions that lie underneath the words. It is not waiting for them to stop so you can talk about yourself.

It is keeping your mind from wandering off into parallel thoughts that rise up as you listen. It is the ability to push those thoughts to the side and stay focused on your friend.

It is paying attention when you are walking down the street or hiking on a mountain path.

It is feeling the wind on your face

It is hearing the sounds of the birds in the trees or their calls in the distance.

It is feeling your heart beating

It is smelling the scents on the wind

It is all this.

It is the feeling

It is simply being aware.

However, but mostly just in social situations. Now for the extra problem. I don't even realize that I've sad anything inappropriate until someone explicitly says that it was. I have no idea what this problem is. You might say that ""Oh, just think about what you say before you say it"". It does not work. I simply can't differentiate between what's appropriate and inappropriate. You could practically tell me the most disgusting story you've ever heard over dinner, also, and it wouldn't even phase me, so it goes both ways. In fact, I'd probably laugh at it while eating a burger.

It might not help that, and I just don't like most people...

And granted, I need help on this. Staying at home on the weekends is boring. I'm wondering what advice this subreddit can give.

Alternatively: has anyone done something like this before? I've broken my days down into productive habits/unproductive habits, but it's just interesting and for my own personal knowledge), then I'll have a better idea of what makes me happy and how I'm improving myself.

I'm a computer programmer, but there is a huge gap with talking on the phone, if the phone rings sometimes I have a mini-breakdown. That's one of my targets for self improvement, I don't have money tough to call anyone, If I did I'm not sure who I'd call to practice.
I'm doing what I can from the position I'm in, I tried volunteering to make an iPhone app for the Cancer society but never heard back. Recruiters ring once in a while but I either can't answer the phone, freeze or go into an uncontrollable stutter. I'm absolutely fine in face to face interviews but you can't get those straight away now a-days.
Like I said I'm still optimistic but it's very frustrating

For example:

* I plan on fixing my sleep habits
* Scheduling exercise for first thing in the morning
* Setting up Blocks of time meant for strict
* eating better
* cleaning up my room (and maintaining it daily)
