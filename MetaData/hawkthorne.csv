- License code under MIT and assets under CC BY-NC

- Add Chang's sprite. He still isn't playable

- Add the torch

    You can't interact with them yet

- Add bottles and pots to the tavern.

    You can't smash them yet.

    Before entering a level
The overworld is still a work in progress. Sprites currenly don't walk
under trees. You also currently can't get back to the overworld.

- Add daybreak as the pause music.

    I also refactored how audio is handled. You'll notice that the main
level track will replay it's much more often now. This bug is intended
until we get each level's individual music.

- Change britta-bot post template

- Add a minimum framerate. Pause the game when not in use

    Many people complained of falling through the floor at odd times. A
minimum framerate fixes these things. However
'slow' for some users on lower-end computers. There isn't a better way
to fix this

    The game will now pause when it loses focus. No more getting attacked by
hippies when you minimize the window.

- Add consistent level music. No more fading in and out

- Add version file for release notification

- Add a bunch of costumes.

- Refactor jump code.

    You'll no longer be able to jump while in midair. If you are still
experiencing problems jumping

- Add an ending screen

    Since the game isn't finished yet
you leave town. Press space
screen

- Bump release version to v0.0.13

**Present**

The subreddit and game are stronger than ever. We have a very high online user
count for subreddit of our size.  People have been adding amazing stuff to the
game
for the last two weeks. It's a great feeling.

With all this development
adding so many features
are we going to do about it?

**Future**

My focus for the next weeks will be first on performance and then gameplay.
This means there may be some large changes coming around the corner. To make
sure we hear your feedback
will be a release every Monday
allows us to get feedback from you on a regular basis and also gives us time to
fix bugs between releases.

Now that we have such amazing levels
interesting gameplay. Some gameplay was featured on the show (boss battles
inventory
levels
story-development team to figure out how we want to game to progress after you
beat Cornelius. 

Every since I started the game
structure levels and level progression. The original game featured in DEP is a
hybrid platformer-RPG and I think we need to do more to embrace the RPG side of
the game. To fix this
is going to switch from a Mario-style overworld map to a Zelda-style persistent
world. This change allows us to have some areas that are structured differently
(such as the black caverns) along side open-world areas like the Greendale
campus. A persistent world also allows us to properly replicate the
transformation of the Town into New Abedtown.

The overworld artwork is fantastic and won't be going away. We'll be
using it as a map you can access from your inventory. While the game is
in development

That's it for now. Thanks for making this the best subreddit around.

layout
everyone involved

We also have two new costumes

We've connected more levels together and also updated the first

Enjoy!

PS: While we now have the blacksmith sounds and sprites

Many Windows users are finding they can't open the game

**FROM THE DEVS**

Happy Thanksgiving everyone! We wanted to get this release out in time for the holidays
so you enjoy some Hawkthorne with your turkey. Every once in a while
that adds a bunch of new stuff. This is one of those releases. We have a new part to the forest
a new hurt animation, weapons have finally been added. 

You can make weapons using crafting. Here are the recipes. Note
but it's what we have now.

    mace   = rock + rock
    mallet = rock + leaf
    knives = rock + stick
    torch  = lead + leaf
    swords = stick + stick

I've saved the best news for last. Many of our OS X players haven't been able to enjoy the game
for more than a few minutes. The audio would start to lag and then the game would freeze up. I'm 
excited to announce that we now have a better version of our framework

With so many changes

- Fix automation tools

    The Makefile had the wrong version for uploading new changes. The
version script can now get previous version numbers. Minor changes to
the cityscape psd.

- Fix error with automatic submission to subreddit

    I'm now using requests and my own code to interact with the Reddit API.
Much easier and less error prone.

- Recreate opening logo

- Add Jeff as a playable character

- Clean up character flashing code

    Flashing is now done using a periodic timer. This fix will prevent
characters from getting into a state where being invulnerable still
allowed them to get hit by an enemy.

- Add Troy as a character

- Add Shirley as a playable character

    Note that her jump animation is not correct. I'll need to refactor
everyone's jump animation in three states: up
have the same for all three

- Fix version script

- Bump release version to v0.0.4

It's been a while since our last release
release is packed with new features. Sadly
release. We do have one awesome addition
after character select. I hope you guys like it. 

So
now the code base is a bit of a mess
is to clean up the pain points so that we can get back on schedule. Once that
process has been finished (to an extent)
Weapons and additional levels are next on the todo list.

I know some of you would like us to go faster
Thanks for sticking with us. We develop for you
reports and feature requests coming in.

You'll also notice that there is no default layout for sprites. I did this because each character is very different.

Sadly, and shooting lighting were scratched due to time.

**Where you come in**

We have 10 animations left to finish. Let's do it. Most of these are for Pierce. [Sign up on the spreadsheet and get to work](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhXdsqGjvkjPdE1aN1lrNTU3QW5Wb3Q4NFZhUF9ZV2c#gid=6).

It's Monday
cooked up an awesome release today with some major new features.

jhoff completely rewrote how floorspaces work. Any room that is 2.5d now
supports jumping and walking **behind** objects. We've tested this thoroughly
but there still may be some bugs.

**The default controls have changed**. We know that many people aren't going to
like them. We're working on adding customization
complain about them. The new controls are:

- MOVEMENT: Arrow Keys
- JUMP: Space
- ACTION: Left shift
- INVENTORY: v
- START: Escape

Lastly

Happy Hawkthorning!

(that's more than the Dean himself) and had over 350 people help us with with

the subreddit for your continued play testing and support.

I'd like to keep this post upbeat
Hawkthorne. Our daily unique play numbers are down from a high of 1500 players
to only [60 a day](http://i.imgur.com/VdnPpTT.png). Our subreddit is drawing
less than 1000 unique visitors a day. Many features seen in the show [still
haven't made it into the game][missing]. The more traffic we get
is to attract new contributors

So

- A strict two-week release schedule. There will be a new release every second
  Monday at 9am. The features for each release will be tracked and decided on
  right after the previous release
  on.
- Focus on missing elements from the show instead of original content. This
  means that levels like Gay Island and Valley of Laziness will see fewer
  updates as we work on adding Gilbert fights
- An emphasis on testing
  breaking the existing game.
- Retooling the interface to make the game easier to navigate.

I don't mean to be all doom and gloom. We're a strong community and I have no
doubt that next year

Since we just passed 7, thought I would take the time to do a quick write up on current and future plans for the game.

First off, music, code, and testing help that everyone here has provided has made the game possible. Without you, the game wouldn't have gotten off the ground.

Let's talk about current plans. I've gotten many messages from people eager to help out

- Testing every new release and reporting bugs
- Contributing to the Story Dev WIKI
- Creating new levels and sprites for the game
- Creating Sound effects

All of these efforts are needed. We've been using a spreadsheet to organize most of this, the spreadsheets are becoming unwieldy. Therefore, I'm going to be switching over to using Github issues to track all bugs and features. This means that if you're interested in helping out, you can just go to the [issues page](https://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey/issues?labels=&amp;page=1&amp;state=open), find a bug or feature you'd like to work on, and get to work. Once you're done, just open a pull request and the code will be merged in.

If you need feedback on a costume or sprite

And now, you can just run around levels. I'm going to be working on adding enemies, NPCs, and actual gameplay. Hopfully, the game will start to feel more like an actual video. There will some follow up posts in the future about how you can help with this effort.

That's it for now. Feel free to ask any questions you have in the comments.

**EDIT**: Wanted to mention that we hang out and chat in [#hawkthonre](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=hawkthorne) on freenode. Come join us.

With this release

## Changes

- **Automated error reporting:** No more posting images of stack traces in the subreddit. The game will automatically report problems in a central place so we can fix them quickly
- **Game save management:** Select which game save you'd like to use
- **Redesign HUD**: Simpler design and larger health bar.
- **Lightning and Arrows**: You can finally shoot lightning and arrows. Check the comments for instructions on how this works.
- **A more faithful overworld**: You can only travel to areas you've seen. Green flags show up when you've completed an area.
- **Costumes:** 39 new costumes (almost all from one person) I can't even keep track.

~~Good question. We are doing this project for 2 reasons: 1st, digging, punching, kicking and sliding to everyone for consistency, so they can be used in cutscenes and regular gameplay.~~

~~/u/edisonout and several others have done an amazing job so far. So much so that the sheer volume of work they've done makes my brain hurt. They could really use an extra hand. If we just had a handful of people jump in to help get this done

If you take a look at all those GitHub issues

[Sentry](http://www.getsentry.com) is a service that ""notifies you when your users experience errors in your web and mobile apps."" Whenever Hawkthorne crashes, meaning we couldn't fix it. Armed with this new information, we can fix long standing bugs that we didn't even know about it, making Journey to the Center of Hawkthorne more stable, and more fun to play.

Huge thanks to Chris and the Sentry team for giving us an unlimited account free of charge.

character sheets look awesome
make them work in-game.

sprites

You may be wondering why some of these sprites are on the list. For example
none of the current characters have attack
me to my second point.

**Finishing the Main Characters**

Big thanks to Drook for pointing out that the majority of our character sheets
are incomplete. If I wanted to implement crouching or attacking today
couldn't. This is where you come in. I've added all the missing sprites to the
[Sprite To-Do

Right now

I'd love to here what ideas you have for other characters.

For Troy

However, you will be prompted ""would you like to fix the AC: yes/no""

If Troy selects yes, as well as Black Hitler.

If the future of the game includes items

I have no idea how complex it would be to implement these 'secret rooms' for the characters

This isn't anything to worry about. Reddit is a very fickle place
thing that was popular a week ago is forgotten the next. I'm very confident
that our numbers will start improving once we get releases back to once a week.

The developers have been running into some issues with the code base. Since we
grew so fast
with code
improving the code base so that we can add features faster. However
only a temporary focus.

Gameplay is
this game to be faithful to the episode
this to be a game you come back to day-after-day to see what's new to play.

The real work has just begun. Video games are not easy to make. They take time
and effort

1362653928.0,19u8ei,[Idea] Pillow Fort Level,prene7,63,5,16,"Hey everyone

Here are some of the ideas that have been *bounced* around:

* A separate level where you can choose which side you'd like to be on and fight against the other side.
* Build your own blanket/pillow fort.
* Enemies could be The Changlourious Basterds
* Weapons would obviously be pillows
* You pull the fire alarm and it transfers you to the pillow/blanket fort level
* Similar to the rave level
* Boss could be [Pillow Man](http://community-sitcom.wikia.com/wiki/Pillow_Man) 
* Capture the dean
* Bonus level where you can gain more hearts by going to Annie's infirmary. 

We would need to convert current Greendale tilesets to Pillowtown and Blanketsburg. Also we would possibly have to create new sprites depending on if we want the Changlourious Basterds and Pillow Man. 

There are so many possibilities. So what are your thoughts/ideas?

* [Closet level](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3234330/deans-closet_screenshot.png) - I liked the suggestion for the level to advance vertically but it was too problematic

Still to do:

* Add audio selections
* Create sprites for inner office (chairs
* Add closet level bad guys - I am still thinking about this
* Add closet level fireplace animation
* Create usable items? - the functionality hasn't been added to the game yet (picking up and using rock, I could make the sprites now for any level-related items.

Greetings Hawkthorne! Now

This will be a *very* wordy post

&amp;nbsp;

--------------------------------------------------

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;##Your Thoughts 

&amp;nbsp;

We're going to be tackling some issues today. These are things that we definitely need input from the players such as yourselves

* **Ember vs. Flame**

*[Github Issue](https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey/issues/1520)*

Currently, and flame + stick makes a torch weapon. The question is, does this similarity between the two materials cause some confusion the players? Could a player mistake ember for a flame and assume it does nothing when combined with a stick? Post your opinions below!

* **Player's health**

*[Github Issue](https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey/issues/1473)*

Right now, our levels and enemies are very subject to change, and 20HP might be way too little once we get to the harder, later levels in the future. What we should also be looking into is how we're going to support the changing of the player's max health.

We have all agreed that there will be no leveling system in Hawkthorne, if the player gains the ""Boots of Speed"" the player will be able to run at twice the normal speed. If the player gains the ""Armor of Health"", the player's max HP is increased. What I'm proposing is the use of these equipments to allow the player to customize how his abilities will be boosted, though there are other suggestions such as heart containers placed periodically throughout the game giving the player boosts in max health. Post your opinions below on how you think this should be implemented!

* **Costumes/Armor/Equipments**

*[Github Issue](https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey/issues/1516)*

Like I mentioned above

Unfortunately, and have slots that the player can put different items in to customize his skills. 

For those not familiar with League


- Equipment purchases do not have a visual element on the character, which the player can customize to put in any item/equipment they desire. 
- Costumes are purely for player enjoyment. They do not add any special advantage or disadvantage. The player can start out and play with any costume
- Some items have unique effects that do not stack
- This will leave room for endless customization, and beat the obstacles in levels easier.

Post your opinions below what you think!

* **Controller Support**

*[Github Issue](https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey/issues/1556)*

I'm just going to post the description in the issue since it is much more succinct than I could ever write:

""I think that it's time to re-evaluate the future for controller support in Hawkthorne

What I suggest is limiting the main game to 9 different keys but allowing use of the keyboard for ""extended"" play features

Post your thoughts below!


&amp;nbsp;

I wanted to ask for a little clarification about the direction the game is going in. Is this just an attempt to create a playable version of the episode or a fully functional game? Both are really cool ideas

Realistically, the map is just about complete given what was in the episode. (There's the inside of a few buildings in town, the over-world map, and hawthorne castle, but that's it for what was actually shown in the episode. Also, I'm sorry if I forgot something, but realistically

So I really want to drive at what's next. Obviously

I want to get the creators' views on where things go after version 0.1.0, to know if/what the idea is for continuing the game. When people ask what they can do to help, I think this is what they want to help with. For example, I would love to help with the story content of the ""lost levels"" (unseen in the episode.) However, I don't want things to get confusing if my ideas don't mesh with the creators.

Personally, and I definitely want to see it succeed. So, that's my idea of how I could contribute, thoughts?

--------------------------------------------------

&amp;nbsp;


I'm going to rant for a bit before I really take off here. Feel free to skip this section if you'd like. 

Everyone here, the 12,674 Community fans (as of 8:56PM PST) that are subscribed to this subreddit, have come to this place for a single purpose that is the recreation of the Digital Estate Planning episode. Every single one of us has thought to ourselves after finishing that episode, ""this needs to exist as a real game"". Every single one of us has creamed our pants when we found out that it actually indeed did exist, and every single one of us creamed the second pair of fresh pants after we bounced on the head of the first hippie in the hallway. This project is a testament to the amazing and dedicated fanbase of the show, and we'd love it to be fueled by the ideas and work of the wonderful Community fans. So without further ado, the fans. 

&amp;nbsp;


------------------------------------------

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;##Your Thoughts 

So this is how this section is going to go. We are struggling over several gameplay mechanics that we hope that /r/hawkthorne could help us out with. Simply comment on the post your opinion and we'll make sure the general consensus is implemented in the game.

&amp;nbsp;

***1. The Interact Button***

Our current game has two versions of the interact button: 'v' and 'up'. The 'v' button takes care of most things, but the 'up' button is used for other things such as picking up items or going through doors. These two buttons often confuse newcomers to the game, who often mistakenly attempt to use the 'v' button to pick up items. In this sense, the use of the 'up' button would be more convenient. On the other hand, using the 'up' button will be difficult in our 2.5D levels such as the town tavern or blacksmith, as a player might accidentally trigger events while simply trying to navigate up. 

What we need from /r/hawkthorne is what you think the interact button should be condensed into.

* Interact should be 'v'

* Interact should be 'up'

* [Why not both?](http://www.alanly.ca/memes/why-not-both.jpg)

* Or some other alternative suggestion 

Post your thoughts in the comments below!

&amp;nbsp;


***2. Winter Wonderland***

This is a bit more trivial and not as important, as in from Cornelius Hawkthorne's perspective, so any other in-show references would seem out of place in the hawkthorne side of the game. What we need are suggestions in where we can move the Winter Wonderland levels. We'd like to have the Winter levels accessible from Greendale, which if you haven't found yet, is currently hidden in one of the more obscure buildings right now. Should it be accessible from Duncan's office? Perhaps a secret entrance from Abed's dorm? Again, post your suggestions below in the comments. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;##Suggestion Box

&amp;nbsp;

Looks like I'm out of things to say, that **we will actually make sure to put in the game**. The highest upvoted or the suggestion we like the most will be chosen and will hopefully be implemented in the next release. There are two things to keep in mind here. First, keep in mind that these need to be realistic, functional things that can actually be manageable to make. That means no suggestions like ""digging please"" or ""when can I kill the blacksmith"". Second, there is no guarantee that no matter how many upvotes, the highest comment might not make it into the game as we could feel that it's not a feasible suggestion.

We're not only looking for suggestions, please feel free to *constructively* and intelligently provide any criticisms you might have with the game. 

Alright, thank you for bearing with me. Anyways, happy October 19th, and we look forward to hearing from all of you!

While the priority of many people working here is to finish the levels of Cornelius' game

So, going through the door leads not to Greendale (as it does currently) but a room with multiple doors (each representing an independent sub-game with its own storyline). One door would lead to Greendale as it does now while others would lead to each sub-game's own starting location. 


- [Here is a quick graphic illustrating the concept](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3234330/hawk.png)

So

* 1. a part of the DEP Cornelius game?  
* 2. a part of an existing sub-game (right now that is only Greendale)?
* 3. a potential new sub-game or part of a new sub-game? 

For example, with a small Neil AD&amp;D level within Greendale but also be the basis for a larger expanded version at the same time. The point of this example is to show both some of the considerations for where ideas might fit but also demonstrate that knowing where an idea might go would also help determine what details need to be worked out to bring it closer to reality.

I've been forcing my way through more multiplayer stuff even though I had intended to ease up on developing it. Some fun things I noticed during the process so far that everyone who has been listening to me on IRC would get annoyed hearing.

The Java client uses libgdx

What does this mean? We'd be available on more machines with less effort and we'd have a viable basis for going mobile. To anyone claiming Java is slow. It's not. It's technically faster than Lua even when Jit'ted

Some benefits I see already:

* easily resizable windows. Our Lua implementation is similar to a prom dress made out of carpet remnants. This is the unfortunate reality of Lua being an easy language to modify.
* easily maintainable code: any front end(Java
* refactoring isn't a nightmare: I see no universe where people appropriately name all variables and functions the first time. Changing their names shouldn't waste development time. In Lua it does.

Had some issues with merging my Lua Server to version 0.0.69. I've had to maintain separate branches that have differing functionality in the past

Firstly, and the nose is reshaped, and eyebrows are unconnected. 

And he's got no legs. (EDIT: This may change.)

**IMPORTANT POINT:** I am making the larger, and I'd encourage others to do the same. Their costumes are different and they're meant to represent the actual characters in flashback. 

Secondly

1) Walking. The puppets have no legs. I felt it best to replicate the look of the puppets and not give them feet. This will affect a lot. Since they can't walk

http://i.imgur.com/tUSjeGP.gif

This can be accomplished with the same three-frame action as regular walking. 

(EDIT: Because of early replies

2) Kicking and sliding. Same challenge. For kicking, the base will remain on the ground, with a bulge near the bottom where the imaginary puppeteer has just jutted his elbow out. 

(EDIT: If legs are added

3) Arm bars: Muppet-style puppets use little bars to move their arms. I have included them in my design. They don't hurt anything

I'm actually planning on splaying the arms a little during static sprites since it's the default for puppets. 

4) Jumping: One of my sprites shows a sliver of puppeteer arm. Ignore it. The puppet, bouncing on its base. 

(EDIT: Regardless if the puppet is legged or legless

5) Crouching: I'd like to incorporate some wrinkling/crumpling of the fabric when the characters crouch

6) Hurt: There's precious little opportunity to demonstrate the physicality of the puppet's mouths (maybe during jumps, the mouth wide open and the top half of the head bent back at a 90-degree angle. 

7) Dead: My current idea is to have a ""deflated"" puppet

That being said

**Respawning**

* I've mentioned this in another thread but I think it would be great if when you respawn

**Inventory**

* I noticed that if you have a full materials inventory and try to combine items to create a new material (i.e. rock + rock = stone) it doesn't place the new material in your inventory

* Would it be possible to remove items from your inventory without selling them? For instance

* Eliminate the item count cap in the weapons inventory - or at least alter it. It's very frustrating having to switch every 15 throwing knives (especially when facing the Boss Jive Turkey). If all your weapons could be pooled under one item slot

* Similarly, but it would be nice to have one slot with all your sticks or stones in it, instead of having multiple instances of the same material.

**Healing**

* I noticed that when I tried using the healing potion I bought from the blacksmith, but thought I would mention it. 

**Map**

* When I opened up from a saved game, and wanted to return to blacksmith in the town. However in order for me to make it to the town, I had to go back to the beginning and work my way through the forest (which isn't a huge deal, it's just a bit cumbersome).

Anyway those were just the things I noticed when playing the game the last two days. This is incredible,False,,t5_2u5zi,False,IDEA,troykickpuncher,t3_1eu68u

I tried to create something as similar as possible to the IS scenes in the show. I added some elements that could be interesing for a hostile environments, geysers, crashing meteorites. There are rock platforms, and cavities which can be put in rock surfaces to climb on. Credits for the telephone cabin and lava go to BuckyBrewer and Ohsin.

I will be including your username and I welcome sentiments and comments beyond my questions.

**1)** How did you hear about the game?
**2)** Have you been active in its creation? (coding, finding bugs, etc.)
**3)** Would you consider yourself a bigger fan since Journey to the Center of Hawkthorne's creation began? Less of a fan? About the same?

~~`JUMP` goes to a previous window in a UI~~

`JUMP` selects an option

`ATTACK` goes to a previous window in a UI

In other words

### Dialogs (and Cutscenes)
~~`ATTACK` advances a single dialog~~

`JUMP` advances a single dialog

should skipping a set of dialogs be an option? if so either `INTERACT` or double tap `JUMP` might be appropriate.

*Sidebar: @jhoff's suggestion of double tap to move down a platform has already been proven very intuitive especially in light of the most recent playthrough video.

### Doors
`UP` (or down or left or right depending on the direction of the door)
**and**
`INTERACT`

Either the directional key that corresponds to the direction of that door or `INTERACT` should be viable solutions

### Picking up materials that end up in your inventory(leaf, et al.)
`INTERACT`

### Picking up an object that can't end up in your inventory(pots baseball)
`INTERACT`
If you have a weapon equipped we can tell the user they can't interact with objects that can be picked up until the put away their weapon... or we dequip it for them (opinions?)

### Throwing an object that you're holding
`ATTACK`

### Dropping an object that you're holding
`ATTACK` + `DOWN`

### Vertically throwing an object that you're holding
`ATTACK` + `UP`

So I have in mind three Mariachi band members that would roam around at different 'zones' but when near player they would follow him playing and hitting him until player drops money.Now I don't know if being able to drop money would be a feature so this can be changed.

I would make sprites as time allows ... shouldn't be too hard.

Mariachi no.1 Guitar player : Plays and hits with guitar (like a club) alternately.

Mariachi no.2 Violin player : Plays and hits with bow.

Mariachi no.3 Trombone player : Plays and Pokes with Trombone slide.

I also think dancing skeletons from 'Day of the Dead' is a good choice.

Dean's Closet needs a boss. Who else will guard the drafts of Time Desk from being stolen? Professor Garrity? Don't make me laugh.

Some sort of giant, then jump on them before they turn around. Also, let's get some lasers in there, too.

Anywhoo, however, the Dalmationator states that it must ""Return Jeffrey to master: conscious or not!"" before it attacks. Playing as the Dean will confuse the Dalmationator, and it states that you being his master is improbable, declares that you must be the Doppledeaner, and attacks.

That aside

-Fairly certain this is something everyone is aware of, they feel a bit boring after the Sandpits. And maybe a bit more difficulty leading up to there would be good to get players ready, something roughly Cave of Frozen Memories-level.

-The writing in NPC conversation trees and answers stands out as VERY rough. Most if not all need a punch-up and copy edit. The Hilda information list should be in a consistent voice and peppered with acknowledgement of the games being referenced — maybe a spreadsheet or dedicated thread for this would be useful. 

-Some NPC conversation dialogs don't have an ""I am done with you"" option

-Selectiong *Yes* in the save game dialog produces a sound that sounds like a menu exit or cancel, along with maybe some visual acknowledgement that the game has been saved (but it shouldn't be too time-consuming). 

-On the same topic,"" maybe something unique (Zelda inspired maybe?)

-Would like to echo the call for projectiles to be grouped in larger quantities (i.e. not overflowing to a new tile if you have more than 15 throwing knives). 

-IMHO ""That's What Christmas is For"" doesn't fit the mood of the entire Cave of Frozen Memories

-I LOVE the costume unlocking idea and eagerly await its implementation.

-Would possibly like to see something rarer in the hard-to-reach chests (esp. the treetop chest) (nothing is really ""rare"" now

-I love the idea of differing item prices (bones more expensive in the first town)

-I agree with the comment that the Ember and Flame look too similar

-I kind of feel the default mapping of jump to spacebar makes for awkward finger positioning

1339614751.0,v0aa5,[UPDATE] From the Story Dev Team,NotablyConventional,31,4,12,"Hello

We've had a virtual pitchfest and we've landed on a few things we'd like to share. The very first thing we've done is lay-down our priorities based on Derferman's guidance from the [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/hawkthorne/comments/uj01a/clarification/) which started the story development wiki.

Priorities:
#1: Reinterpret the episode as seen on TV. Six playable characters (Jeff, Pierce, Shirley and Troy) going through only the levels seen on TV and communicating the story through text and cutscene as well as playable bits. This game is all on the railroad tracks. The player's not really going to have much impact on actual gameplay.

#2. Expand the game to include the levels on gay island, etc. Still very railroad tracks.

#3. Work out Abed's role as a playable character (since he stays at the village and learns the ins and outs of the game

#4. [Abed's computer](http://hawkthornestorydev.wikispaces.com/Abed%27s+Computer) and beyond. These include characters not seen in the episode and creating more Community the game than Journey to the Center of Hawkthorne.

Abed's computer is the story justification we found to recreate more of the community universe than Cornelius would have created. At the end of the episode, but on Abed's computer, but we're still looking for suggestions. (Also, this is a LONG, LONG, LONG, LONG ways away.)

(Really long, it's really far away.)

We'd also like to offer a friendly reminder that if you have ideas about how the game will communicate the story to the players

So my first idea is characters abilities, i thought it would be nice for each character to have his own little ability to start the game with and diffrinciate himself:

**Troy** - no active abilities

  

**Pierce** - have the ability to sprint(or run away - when pressing the sprint key Pierce will go to sprint mode in which he can run 3 times as  fast as he normally can, each sprint will last few seconds and have a cooldown afterwards, also you can't stop mid-sprint, so people won't use it for one second to get half the damage when hit.

**Jeff** - simply have the ability to slide

**Shirley** - can do a ground pound - when jumping she can do a ground pound that will sent her to the ground quickly

**Annie** - can do a ""using her sexuallity"" attack

**Britta** - can do ""the worst"" attack, ofcourse have a cooldown and enemies can only be hit by this once.

**Abed** - staying with the racist theme of the game
(okay, if you have good suggestions leave them in the comments).



That's it for the characters abilities
My idea is to have ""Custom tokens"" scattered around the game that will give each character an ability from a custom, etc).
This is how each character will use them:

**Abed** - will randomly get alien custom or batman custom
Alien custom - for few seconds abed wil run fast, even far ones, by leaping on them and attacking them, ends after few seconds or 2 kills.
Batman custom - can glide for a few seconds while jumping

**Pierce** - can turn into drugs

**Jeff** - can turn into ""hulk jeff"", and a lot more stronger, ends after few seconds.

**Annie** - turns into karate annie (from paragdims)

**Britta** - turns into brittasaurs, after those 3 she have to pee so she loses the custome.

**Shirley** - turns into ""Big chadder"", but extremly slow, each step she does does a ground pound to the area, lasts for few seconds.

**Troy** - turns into that robot nerd thing from the halloween episode

And that's it, but hopefully it will be implented in the end, ofcourse feel free leaving comments to help make these ideas better or just yell ""THEY SUCK YOU LOSER"".

Some of the devs have recently had a discussion on how to visually implement armor in the game

We thought we'd open it up to you guys to get your opinions on the matter. We have 6 options and they each have various upsides and downsides.

[Here is an image of the six possible options](http://i.imgur.com/INuKH3M.png) - on the left is the character without armor &amp; on the right with armor.

1. Visually
2. Costume doesn't change
3. Switch from your costume to the character's armor spritesheet - will look strange if you go from playing as Thoraxis to normal Jeff in armor. Will also need to creature spritesheets for every character other than Annie.
4. Overlay armor onto the current costume - this won't match up exactly and will look very strange on certain costumes
5. Character changes colour when they have amour - similar to how they turn red when they're attacked - this isn't how they did it in the episode
6. If you want armor

Here's [**my current non-progress**](http://i.imgur.com/hFXEq.png)

My thoughts: the first floor should be a bar filled with familiar NPCs from the town. Obviously

On the second floor should be the Casino where we have the two card games we currently have as well as additional machines that will house a variety of minigames as you unlock them during normal gameplay.

The third floor can have anything from a restaurant to a house of illrepute. It would be a nice reference to the era the game appears to be set in as well as simpsons.

On floors 4 to (n-1) will be hotel rooms(IDEA: beds can be used to replenish health at the expense of time) and the final floor will have a pool. Obviously you can't swim yet

I sincerely hope someone more competent than me can help take on this work.

1367070741.0,1d7r9s,Story Dev Discussion Thread #1,edisonout,33,10,8,"After his most recent post yesterday

**STORY DEV'S FOCUS**
------

Instead of simply pitching ideas, enemies, bosses, sub-levels, quests etc. are all thought out and all have a purpose. I'll expand on this further .

**EXAMPLE**

The town level is a perfect (yet simple) example of what we require. The main level is a simple left-to-right progression but with 4 interesting aspects which are almost essential to gameplay (although currently incomplete).

1. **Hilda** &amp; other NPC's - provide you with information (e.g. tells you where to find the white crystal) to help you complete the game
2. **Tavern** - more specifically
3. **Potions lab** - can brew potions which will give you specific abilities to use elsewhere
4. **Blacksmiths** - buy weapons so you can defeat enemies more easily.

So for each level we'll need to consider the following (this list is not exhaustive):

* What do we want from the level? Does it have sublevels? A boss? Quests?
* What's the goal? What's the story? How is this connected to the world of Hawkthorne?
* Are there materials to collect? What will these materials be used for?
* Are there areas where we need special items or powers? Will we need a potion? How will the player know they need these?
* Will we need to craft something? Will we have passed all the required materials to make this yet?
* What sort of enemies do we want? Do we want  a variety? Will they be defeated in different ways? 
* Will I be forced to use weapons to kill this enemy? Which weapon? (I'm lazy
* Is there anything new the player encounters in this level? Will they know how to approach it? (e.g. is it obvious they're supposed to climb up the vine or fetch a key from somewhere else to open the door)
* Will players have to backtrack to complete the level?
* Will certain areas be locked?
* Will certain items be available which can/must be used later on?
* Are there hidden items or areas? Are there areas which are only accessible once players have completed something elsewhere? Will player have to interact with something (like straightening the picture frame) to find the door? Will they have to dig down to it? Will doing anything in this level unlock/affect something elsewhere?
* Will players want a save point? Are they likely to have enough health at the end of the level to take on the boss?
* Do we want the music to change in certain areas? What sound effects do we need?
* What obstacles are going to be in place? Jumps? Spikes? 
* Is the difficulty going to be based on timing? Skill? Practice? Having the right materials? Large number of enemies? Powerful enemies? Big jumps? 
* What can players interact with? What's the purpose of this interaction?
* What makes this level enjoyable? Where's the fun?

Now I'm not suggesting we go into deep analysis and start contemplating every pixel or think everything must mean something or each jump serves a higher purpose but people will get frustrated if we include a watermelon they can't pick up or a door they can only open with a key they don't have or have to use a potion purely arbitrarily. 


**STORY DEV'S GOAL**
------

The story dev will act like a brainstorming group who will pitch, develop and improve ideas to flesh out levels,  with the ultimate goal of producing a road map of each level. So a document listing the features, enemies, sub-levels, items etc. we want to appear along with their purpose which we can then pass over to the level designers. 

We will begin with Valley of Laziness and Gay Island because they are the levels we saw nothing of in the episode so we have no guide to how the level should play out.

**GETTING INVOLVED &amp; COMMUNICATION**
------

Anyone who wants to can get involved can do. For starters

Depending on the number of people who get involved and their time-zones, each member could each have their own google doc with ideas, maps &amp; images which the devs can consolidate to one document or reddit post and get the rest of the community's opinions. I'm reluctant to use the storydev wiki because it's out of date, requires an additional sign up and it's very easy for good ideas to get lost. If anyone's got a better idea, please let me know. Possibly an additional subreddit?

[**Sign up here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmWu3Lwx1gaMdFRPWjdfTWhud21CVG45ejFPVG4wSFE#gid=0) - fill out the spreadsheet with your username

**FINAL WORD**
------

If you'd like to have a say in how this game is expanded

Everyone's ideas and opinions are welcome but please don't get annoyed, don't fit in with the game, are impracticable or impossible. 

Ultimately

**TL;DR** We're coming up with ideas on how to expand Valley of Laziness &amp; Gay Island - you can help out if you'd like.",,t5_2u5zi,1367073924.0,ANNOUNCEMENT,anniewerewolf,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/hawkthorne/comments/1d7r9s/story_dev_discussion_thread_1/
1365772757.0,1c7cn2,Idea for costume select screen,edisonout,26,2,10,"[Here's my suggestion for the costume selection screen](http://imgur.com/Ac9vV2r)

So here's how my idea goes: once you've selected your character on the current selection screen (&amp; maybe have separate button for can't be bother to pick costume, which resembled a yearbook/scrapbook. Tabs along the side allow you to navigate to other characters (I haven't been bothered to all put these in).

The currently selected character appears in the large square up the top

Then, we can include ""photos"" of the gang throughout the years - Halloween, astronauts, Christmas, paintball etc. which can be different shapes/sizes to fill to gap.

Other ideas for decoration (which I haven't included)

* custom backgrounds for each character (e.g. stripes
* comments/messgaes - like on the DVD cases
* doodles - flowers, devil horns, again like on the DVD cases 
* pictures from the credits e.g. Joel McHale's nose monster peeping over the edge of a photo
* Greendale butt logo

I don't think it really goes with the look of the game but I'm hoping a change of colour scheme and/or more detail &amp; tweeking can fix this. I thought we'd want more than scrolling or just having squares to select and yearbooks sort of go with the community college setting &amp; the DVD covers.

The audio in the second video is out of sync.

So... I've been moving along on 3 connected pieces of Hawkthorne software.

1) A client made in Lua  
2) A server made in Lua  
3) A server made in Java

The client and server in Lua are (for the most part) the same original hawkthorne code.

Since I really like Java I wanted to do some work on reimplementing the entire server in Java. [This video shows execution of the Java server combined with 2 lua clients](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9x63Lja1Q). Don't worry

The client still has a bunch of work that needs to be done (mainly rendering all nodes). I only implemented the rendering of items(namely the leaf) as a proof of concept.

Developers:
If you're familiar with the code

This was the main reason I wanted to rewrite code in Java. The structure of the OO makes it simpler in many ways. Don't get me started on how much easier refactoring is when you have a language that can use a reasonably good IDE.

So. this post is a request for a couple of things:

1) Any developers who would be interested in helping write code for any portion of these things.

2) Standardising all of the nodes in the Lua code... because it makes sense.


EDIT: This was implemented partially as a proof of concept. If someone wants to develop this in C++ instead I could definitely get on board with that too. Lua and C are already bedfellows anyways.

EDIT2: As an annoying quirk the Lua Server uses Love2d so it sort of unnecessarily launches a new window. The Java server is written only using libgdx for tiledmap parsing. Whoever wants to tackled it could easily do a  polygon/rectangle collision detection. Polygon/polygon might be a little extra work. A Java client(or any other client we want to build) could/should use libgdx for rendering all objects. That'd make it easily playable on droid and other devices.

EDIT3: The Java Server intentionally drops you from that random location. I did that to make sure the doors were working as intended.

**Level: Forest Labyrinth**

* comprised of three sub-levels which have doors connecting different parts of them (I kind of think of them as different layers of the overall level with doors allowing you to naviagate the layers)
* these doors allow the player to maneuver around obstacles and progress towards the true exit
* challenging platforming is present throughout
* the doors are unmarked; thus the player must take note of which parts of the level are connected
* hidden area in which I'd like to have a small stash of coins as a reward for risky exploration (I don't think this is possible at the moment

I'd be interested to hear what you think.

Oh, but I do have an outline of what I'd like to do with it.

I have a playable version including the first two layers [here](https://github.com/MesonicInterference/hawkthorne-journey/tree/forest-labyrinth), so don't be surprised when it crashes - it's unwinnable without that third level.

I will most likely not create a tileset or anything but I figured I might as well share the idea anyways.

anyways.... this is Part 2


anyways...


[You might want to open this](http://i.imgur.com/fPD1H.png) and look at it as you read along with this. When the player enters the Valley of laziness they will see this screen


**Stage 1 - 'La Siesta' Desert**
- the current level the game has now


**Stage 2 - Los Tacos Passage**
- this way to exit the Valley of Laziness, but mexican girlfriend said it may come off bad] can stomach that kinda spice. He states that the 7 true lazy men/women are in different areas waiting sleeping to be called upon. the player states they saw a sleeping man who was unwakeable in the desert. He gives you a bell (that makes a siren noise) and states that should wake them up, he tells you when you have one following you to come back here so they can start eating so it can go faster.


**Stage 1 - 'La Siesta' Desert**
- with the special bell


**Stage 2 - Los Tacos Passage**
- after bringing the man here
-Note after every area the player comes back here to drop of the pure breed


**Stage 3 - The Village of Laziness**
- this is the worst looking area in the entire game. It's completely done in black &amp; white and all the buildings are just either squares or rectangles with the name of whatever it is on top of it. boxes with the word labelled cactus are the scenery. theres an overpriced INN where a player can rest and heal, Nacho Cheese River Boat Ride (40$); Trampoline Tortilla Skies Jumps (20$) and Aztec Pyramids Tour Guides (20$) some if not all will be need to be play twice to get everything you need. but the player gets to choose the next area(s) they want.


**Stage 4 - Nacho Cheese River**
- Players go on a tortilla chip boat and must defend it from taking too much damage from banditos and enemies. At the end the player must jump off the boat onto a platform/hill above a cave which leads to a waterfall. the player will walk up a small hill and see an another tortilla chip boat with the lazy man on it


**Stage 5 - Tortilla Skies**
- After jumping on a giant trampoline the player lands on a giant flying tortilla, the player keeps moveing when a very quickly and very fast tortilla with the lazy man flies below them the player must jump timely on it before it flies away. If the player doesnt die and makes it on there the lazy man and player fly all the way back to the tacos passage. Senior Old Timer tells you once you either chosen this path or aztec pyramids that there are other areas past the tortilla skies, like the pinatas fields and past the pyrmaids lies the mountains.. he warns them theyll have to go there again to get to the other area and just keep going till you finish the area.
** - if the player already had the lazy man here


**Stage 6 - Pinatas Fields**
- player reaches this place after finishing the Tortilla Skies. A very colorfull and bright landscape as hundreds of pinatas are laying around. Things turn creepy as one pinata runs from you. another burst through and begs for you to kill them, the remaining pinatas ask for mercy, the player argues you came after them first while they were just looking for someone, they beg for mercy thinking you were from the village here to take their young, They explained the people of the village take there young and old and destroy the leaving their dead corpses and injured bodies there. These Pinatas Fields are more of a Pinatas Graveyard! After hearing there sappy story, the player sees the sleepy man in prison. The player can [threatened] say he will take that prisoner now! whether by force if need be! or the player can [trade] by asking what they would want for him. If the player threatends they will flee and the player can take the prisoner and jump into a pinata cannon that will take them to the tacos passage. If player tries to trade, they will ask for 300 gold so they can beef up their defenses here. if the player says yes to the 300$ they will happily give them the prisoner and use of the cannon


**Stage 7 - Aztec Pyramids**
- Inside the old pyramids the player must have a torch and the spirit candle in both hands to see and to keep the day of the dead spirits from killing them. The Candle can be bought in town or outside the pyramid. the pyramid seller sells it for more though. With both hands occupied the player can not attack (attacks are useless anyway against these enemies) against the ancient mosters/cat people/ghosts in here. The player must hide and dodge when enemies draw near. When the player makes it to the end theres a hidden room right near it


**Stage 8 - Sombreo Mountain**
- once outside of the pyramid, pull levers, defeat enemies to open paths for the donkey. Once on top, the player will see the sleeping man, the child runs to her parents, and donkey tries to rest. The player uses the bell to wake the man but it scares the donkey as well and he kicks you both off the mountain all the way to the tacos passage.


**Stage 2 - Los Tacos Passage**
- After bringing all 7 of the pure breeds to here

**BOSS BATTLE** - El Beany
- not sure how this battle will be yet. but at the end the 7 pure breeds will eat him
- once the battle is done you may leave


*2nd Playthrough*
-- all 2nd playthroughs are after the white crystal is freed


**Stage 2B - Los Tacos Passage**
- when you get back here


**Stage 3B - Village of Laziness**
- Once youre given the ingredient list and key to senior old timers house, a little cockroach will take the last remaining ingredient and run under a book shelf. The player will move the book shelf to discover a secret entrance to a similar potion room like in the town. The cockroach runs into a sewer hatch in the room, the player follows.

**Stage 3C - Village of Laziness - Salsa Sewers**
- the players jumps down into salsa sewers which has skeletons all over the place

**Stage 2B - Los Tacos Passage**
- once youre back old timer will take the ingredients and start chanting nonsense, you shall live again with me!!"" and jumps into the vomit pool.. a giant dripping vomit monster will rise.

**BOSS BATTLE** - El Vomito!?!
- not sure how this battle will be either since im still not sure about the bean fight yet either.. once defeated



And thats how the Valley of Laziness goes part 1 and part 2... at least in my head.. hope you like

My suggestions:  
1) something much smaller maybe the size of a leaf. Ideas?  
2) This one uses some of the Doctor Who knowledge. In Doctor Who the blue public police call box that the TARDIS manifests as is just a side effect of the TARDIS's cloaking mechanism being broken. Originally  a TARDIS could just look like whatever was appropriate for the time period it was in.

1345790400.0,yqqhy,[IDEA] Markovian scripting and response system for dialog,Rainfly_X,23,2,14,"The following is probably too ambitious

**First

These are kind of a specialty of mine, in the same sense as any game resource.

A Markov chain is a system where every given state has a set of possible ""result states"" weighted by probability. The classic example is a frog that jumps from lilypad to lilypad, like 25%. More advanced systems can take not just the current pad into account, but the _chain_ of the last _n_ pads the frog has jumped to.

**How does that apply here?**

It's a metaphor for my system, which determines the likelihood of other actions and pieces of dialogue. Some chains of behavior will be 100% likely to happen (""strongly written""), others will allow for random branches into other possibilities (""loosely written"").

**How does it work?**

Each character stores a 10-item queue. The character also has a set of preprogrammed ""responses""

    /\dPIERCE: Go suck a bag of dicks./

A response with this regex will *only* be used as a response to that Pierce line

A response content consists of the format ""NAME: Words."" It can also be used to trigger a Lua-scripted action using a forward-slash, ""at"", ""GILBERT""). For more control, you can use the double-forwardslash, in which you can use pure Lua. The same command would be ""ANNIE: //Annie.throw('sword','at','GILBERT');""

There is also a special character named ""CONTEXT"", and it may take awhile for the contexts to sync back up when they rejoin - just like in real life!

The final feature is that for search purposes

    9JEFF: We've been walking for hours.
    8CONTEXT: Jeff bitching.
    7TROY: It's a videogame. It doesn't hurt to walk.
    6JEFF: It hurts my thumbs. Is no one else feeling this?
    5PIERCE: Jeffrey
    4JEFF: Oh shut up
    3SHIRLEY: Pierce
    2JEFF: ....
    1SHIRLEY: Sorry
    0JEFF: I'm disowning you all as friends.

This means you can filter for a sequence of events very easily

     /2JEFF: ...$/
     /0JEFF: I'm disowning you all as friends.$/
     likelihood: 3
     ANNIE: Don't go

**Parallel actions**

Multiple triggers for CONTEXT can occur simultaneously. Same for actions

In fact, and weapon equips into the buffer so that all characters can respond to them.

**Limitations**

The format for dialogue writing is clunky. I think the biggest fix would be to allow a sort of shorthand for multiple lines that lead from one to the other:

     /2JEFF: ...$/
     /0JEFF: I'm disowning you all as friends.$/
     likelihood: 3
     ANNIE: Don't go
     TROY: That's right. We stick up for each other to the end.
     2&gt;TROY: /meaningful_look with ABED

Response content lines with a x&gt; are given likelihood x, so you'd override likelihood for just the first line. Each line in a group is created with a regex to match the previous line at position 0.

Another limitation is executing so many regexes so often. Compilation helps, and not terrible, though I welcome other ideas.

Finally, and I still don't know exactly how to do it.

**Implementing this**

I'll try to do it off in my own wacky branch stuff on my own time, and I don't want to hold back development on the core game in that time.

I think it's something that's fully technically possible

**EDIT FOR FEATURES**

After sleeping on it, sorted by likelihood. Then you can choose whatever you want - which also means playing as different characters will allow you to discover a lot of hidden/unlikely conversation paths. If you're a completionist, you'll love this, though the inability to play as certain game NPCs will still limit your ability to methodically analyze every possible game path.

The one problem with this is that often, do it automatically). Another is a ""meh"" button mapped to the keyboard, which lets someone else do the talking - or acting - instead. Lots of ways this could go, and I don't know which will work best without trying it out in-game.

Also, I'm introducing the following types of filter for both modules and lines.

    /matching_regex/
    !/failing_regex/
    :Lua expression

In this example, and the Lua expression evaluates to True. Filter conditions should not have side effects, which is a new concern introduced by the :expression syntax. It's also something that can't really be tested in a Heroku app. But it allows you to be conditional on literally anything in the game, including player inventories, location, costume, whether or not someone has been set on fire,,1345826580.0,t3_yqqhy

&gt;##Your Thoughts 

&amp;nbsp;

***1.  Leveling System***

Yes

*However.*

Our devs are currently divided over this issue. Many of us feel that hawkthorne is a platformer foremost and should have no leveling system

What we really need is a clear roadmap and forethought into how leveling should affect gameplay. What we are currently thinking on is that it is going to be pseudo-leveling, but will unlock more platformer-related skills, similar to the Metroid game series. 

Some of these platform skills include :

* Higher jumping
* Slide attacks
* Creating a temporary platform midair (might not happen)
* Temporary shield to negate damage

and etc.

Please post your thoughts below in the comments

(Note: Keep in mind that this might not even happen at all if most of our devs are opposed)

anyways....


I was told that the black caverns and Valley of laziness


[You might want to open this](http://i.imgur.com/yZR4m.png) and look at it and read along with this. When the player enters the Forest and click on the current ""Forest 1""  they will be taken to what youre looking at.. but more colorful. The names of the levels will probably be change due to lack of creativity for it.



**Stage 1 - The Deep Dark Forest**
- Intro level [seen in game] - players meet Cornelius &amp; Gilbert


**Stage 2 - The Deep Dark Forest Paths**
- Here we can have players fight critters and enemies. another basic level kinda like our current Forest 2, 1 of the pits will lead to a secret area and not to the players death. The secret area leads to the dark forest, but the player cannot currently enter it as there is a magically force field. This section will not be available to the White Crystal is freed from the black caverns, and Gilbert kills them and they have to restart. For now the player is suppose to go the regular path leading to The Deep Forest section.


**Stage 3 - The Deep Forest Hills**
- Players slowly but steadily climb up the hills. Similar to Contra when the players climb hills falling off the screen will lead to death


**Stage 4 - The Deep Forest Falls**
- The players are on top of the hills jumping over the waterfalls on top of rocks, branches, and enemies. once the player falls all the way to the bottom of waterfall out of sight. the player finishes the level and goes to next area.


**Stage 5 - The Deep Forest Lake**
- The player is seen unconscious on a piece of bark, and a mysterious item locked up in a cage outside the house, the players knocked on the door, but it pushes open unlocked. Inside the house players can heal/rest, stock up on items, and read interesting stuff. After rummaging through the house, you find out its Mallows house


**Stage 6 - The Deep Forest Marshes**
- Once the lake water starts turning greenish and cant go any further the players now arrive the Marshes. Players must avoid the greenish water by jumping on rocks and branches. eventually players notice Mallow on the ground, and keeps terrorizing him and his pet Beaverton. 

**BOSS BATTLE** - The Great Forest Critter -
The boss is a combination of a body of a bear, rabbit tail, bird wings, fox head, skunk colors, porcupine back, and any other forest critter. He's the one that been leading the evil creatures to attack you. The player cannot jump on him due to his horns and therefore must stock up on the silver leafs on the trees on the sides of the fighting battle area and jump over him with he charges at you or flies at you causing him to crash into the rock, Mallow gives you thanks and $100 and then calls for his helicopter which his pet Beaverton is flying


**Stage 7 - The Deep Dark Forest Passings**
- basically just a basic forest level to end the forest and transitioned to the town. some enemies, maybe also a giant fence to keep the bad creatures from entering the town.




*2ND PLAYTHROUGH*
- all 2nd playthroughs are after the white crystal is freed
ALL LEVELS FROM 1-7 have less trees or all trees are cut down. i will only put the level description again down here to talk about the differences between the first run and second run (Note Corneilus &amp; Gilbert wont be in the first level but its basically the same now as it was then besides less trees)




**Stage 2B - The Deep Dark Forest Paths**
- here it is basically the same except now the secret pathway to the dark forest is open which i will talk about later if the player chooses to go that way


**Stage 4B - The Deep Forest Falls**
- the rock where you were blind-sided and bull-dozed by the Great Forest Critter is now safe to land on without fear. but this time after you land the next time you jump will activate the rock to fall off the waterfall causing the player to dodge once again down the waterfall.


**Stage 5B - The Deep Forest Lake**
- Reaching Mallows lake house for the second time, when you agree to help. Beaverton gives you the keys to the helicopter as well as, the speed boat, jet ski, and raft. the helicopter will blow up and damage the player, speedboat has no gas, jet ski sinks as soon as started


**Stage 6B - The Deep Forest Marshes**
- player is force to make harder jumps with no branches and just tree stumps. player notices Mallow on the ground again this time unconscious. After arguing with the tribal women to leave the area and Mallow alone

**BOSS BATTLE** - Giant Mutant Lost Woman -
haven't really thought this fight out..
once you defeat her


**Stage 7B - The Deep Dark Forest Passings**
- very similar except the traps and giant wall have been upgraded made out of shiny metal.


**Stage 8 - The Dark Forests' Lost Woods**
- This is the path people can take from stage 2 if they find the secret area and the white crystal has been removed from the black caverns. Now that the cursed woods magic is weakened, twice as hard and scary, set at night... these trees have not been cut like the other areas have been


**Stage 9 - The Dark Forests Creepy Swamp**
- Similar to the first Marsh level


**Stage 10 - The Dark Forest Temple**
- upon entering the temple the player hears a voice in their head from the Great Warlock

**BOSS BATTLE** - Warcraft
Warcraft becomes on fire and shoots fireballs straight at you, its his only weak spot. as if the player tries other times they will take damage.

After you defeat him, if it hits you, you die, but if you jump it hits Monstrosa, transforming him into a Giant Scary looking Tree Monster

**BOSS BATTLE** - Monstrosa Tree
The first part of the battle is for you to reason with it as it chases you breaking through the Temple. The tree chases you through the forest, a rock wall. [now im not sure on how you defeat him, you cant burn him as you need to climb him to get out of there, maybe plucking all his leafs or something. idk] after it is defeated Monstrosa falls against the wall letting the player climb on top of him and over it. The next stage will be Stage 7B from here just the entrance maybe somewhere different idk.

Split up your character into component body parts - head, body, accents etc. and then paste them onto separate layers of your costume image.

**HOW IT WORKS** 

* [This is Pierce's base split up for example](http://i.imgur.com/WCntcLu.png)
* [Changing to  Teddy Pierce costume](http://i.imgur.com/Aji73lq.png)
* Then within five minutes of creating that

Now, head &amp; legs and then it's only a few small tweaks for the more awkward poses.

So you go from having hundreds of sprites to do

I'd like to extend a HUGE thanks to someone on the RPGmaker forums who had some tips on making curly hair on such a small sprite. They said to section it like you would if you were drawing a brain and add lots of highlights. When you zoom out to 100%

I wanted to get Shirley's hair right, I took MAJOR liberties with this one. In the episode she's just surrounded by sparkles, but my first draft made it look too much like the flaking powder I put on the monkey gassed Jeff, so I decided to give her a halo and little wings out of the light specks. Imagine how awesome it will look in Cornelius' Castle or any other lowlight situation!

Now that we are getting rewards for killing hippies, you are rewarded with a delicious 1up. A few old-school games employ this type of reward system, and I feel it will give our game an added level of 8-bit authenticity.

Perhaps this idea can be adapted to work with various weapons once they are added.

My second idea is that badguys should have the capability to respawn once the player has moved a sufficient distance away from them. This could either make farming for gold easier

1371938371.0,1gvkxi,Suggestions for level features,edisonout,19,1,11,"Here's a list of possible new features for levels. Feel free to add your own or comment on the ones already suggested. I'm willing to bet some of these can't be implemented but don't worry about feasibility for now. What would make the levels more exciting or challenging?

##SUGGESTIONS

**MOVING PLATFORMS**

* move in a cirle or a route that isn't a straight line
* disappearing platforms
* continuous loop of platforms which run in opposite direction to level direction
* droppable floors
* disappearing floors (maybe one plank at a time)
* vertical platform you have to interact with to turn it horizontal so you can jump on it


~~IMPEDENCES~~ HAZARDS

* things that explode occasionally
* things that drop from the ceiling (loose icicles)
* big blocks which come down and smash you
* things on the floor to jump over  - flames, hot pipes, spikes, steam - could pop up occasionally rather than be constant
* rolling boulders
* poisoned darts/blow holes


**ENEMIES**

* swinging enemies
* enemies which can only harm you / you can only harm them when they're in a certain state
* enemies you have to attack before you can jump on them (maybe they curl up into a ball / flip onto their back exposing a weakness? - have spikes/hors or similar to show where they're dangerous). Maybe arrows only work if the enemy is standing upright?
* enemies throwing stuff at you - grendades, others only when you're in the proximity
* enemies with a temporary force field around them / have something local stopping you attacking them from in front
* variety of methods of killing - some jump only, others combo of the above
* some only injure you if in certain states
* enemies which are particularly vunerable to certain weapons

**OTHER LEVEL FEATURES**

* dips to hide in while something dangerous flies past
* speed up down some slopes? slow down climbing slopes?
* darkness - can only see a few blocks ahead
* levers to active platforms / bouncy areas / hidden doors etc.
* boost pads
* periodically electricuted floor - something that regularly switchs between killing you and being safe
* things in foreground to partially obscure view such as fences/icicles/stalagmites
* conveyor belts
* climbable walls you can traverse sideways

**CHARACTER ACTIONS**

* pushing &amp; pulling
* crawling
* sliding

**WEAPON TYPES**

* bombs

##HAVE A GO AT MAKING LEVELS YOURSELF

You'll need to 

1. [Follow these instructions](https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey#contribute-to-the-game) on creating a copy of the game on your machine
2. Install [Love2d](https://love2d.org/) - the program that runs the game
3. Install [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) - the editor we use for creating levels
4. Check out our [level creation guide](https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey/wiki/Level-creation-guide)

We only have 1 level designer (the awesome /u/didory123 ) so we'll be thrilled to have absolutely anyone else contribute. If you have any questions

##TEST THESE IDEAS OUT

I've started creating mock-up levels featuring these ideas individually in a very hacky manner

The process of then testing out my levels is quite simple but may seem complicated at first. Trust me

* Open powershell (windows) or terminal (mac)
* One time only - add me as a remote. This just tells your compuer where my version of the game is saved.

&gt;git remote add edisonout https://github.com/edisonout/hawkthorne-journey.git

* Get my version

&gt;git fetch edisonout

* Check out my level test branch

&gt; git checkout edisonout/winterideas

* Convert the map files so love can read them - this will take several minutes the first time you do this since it will also convert the 30 odd levels we have in the game too. You only need to do this step if you edit a level (.tmx) file.

&gt;make (for mac &amp; linux users)

&gt;.\make.ps1 (for windows)

* start a level

&gt;love src -l test1

EDIT: [Guide to using new spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Byjjb3K3J96WuV4n7S0JyFQ2GAwqO9RpTQ4Wye9XJeU/edit)

**Checking the sheets** (for checkers)

I propose a new way of checking characters involving a coloring system.

* When a costume sheet is submitted

* Someone comes along and checks the costume ([See here for issues to check](http://www.reddit.com/r/hawkthorne/comments/zh3f9/wanted_costume_qa_reviewers/)). If it is ready to go in the game, change back to YELLOW to ensure no other issues have been missed.

* Costumes in the game have their row highlighted GREEN.

I also have several rows highlighted GREY - these are additional sheets for secondary characters which can't be completed until the initial character sprite sheet is complete.

If we can get a small group of people going through the spreadsheet and checking newly updated sprites (and/or fixing issues) that would be great. Then



**Updating costumes** (for everyone)

If a row isn't highlighted, please add a date when you assign yourself to a costume. Some have been sitting around uncompleted for months.

Continue adding new costume ideas as you remember them - filling in the appropriate episode slot / inserting new lines if there are multiple costumes per episode. Miscellaneous costumes which don't fit an episode (e.g. Childish Gambino) can go at the bottom of the list.



**TL:DR**

New spreadsheet - 1 tab per character. 

New colorcode: Green - in game, blue - issues, grey - waiting for character sprite sheet to be complete, white - please complete the sprite sheet

~~Please can whoever's in charge of the spreadsheets update the links/merge this spreadsheet into the current one as appropriate. Thank you.~~ New spreadsheet in use.
