Well, with three rehearsals until we open, one of my actors dropped out for questionable reasons.  By the grace of god, I was able to find someone who fit right in and is amazing. 

At the same time, but Ive never felt confident enough to be truly vulnerable.  Yes, the reason my Eeyore is so entertaining is because hes so much more than a sad donkey. But I was terrified to wear my own clothes.  With regular makeup, and get onstage and make a genuine connection with the audience and my fellow actors.  This rehearsal period has been terrible.  There were times when I was convinced I should drop out.  Times when I just knew I was letting everyone down.  But last night, at rehearsal I finally found her.  And I have never been so proud of myself.  

On Saturday, Best.  I could not be more proud of myself.  I have grown as a person.  I pushed myself right to edge and I didnt fall off, and I have proven to myself that I am capable of so much.

I'm from England and moved to NY to study in 2008.  Since leaving school this is my first big production and I wanted to share my excitement and offer this subreddit some discounts for providing me with all the news and discussion I needed on the community for so long!  I'm not a big role but it means a hell of a lot to me to be a part of it.

The code works until the end of July 8th.  Please let me know if anyone is coming!  I'd love to grab a drink after the show!  Also

	Looking around here
	Sure
	
	We've got spike tape and gaff tape a-plenty
	I've got birdies and source 4s galore
	You want scale rules? We've got twenty
	But who cares? No big deal. I want more
	
	I wanna be where the smart lights are
	I wanna see
	Movin' around on those
	Whaddya call 'em? Oh
	
	Spinnin' your wrench
	Bolts are required for tiltin'
	Lightin' along down that
	What's that word again? Stage
	
	Up where they mix
	Up where they act all day as the sun
	DMX free
	Part of that world
	
	What would I give if I could live
	Out of my budget?
	What would I pay to spend a day
	Warm in the lights?
	
	Betcha on plan they understand
	Bet they don't reprimand their workers
	Bright electricians
	Ready to stand
	
	And ready to know what designers know
	Ask 'em the questions and get some answers
	What's a gel? - and why does it
	What's the word? Burn
	
	When's it my turn?
	Wouldn't I love
	The lights up above?
	Out of the spot 
	Wish I could plot 
	Part of that world

((I actually am a lighting designer going into my senior year of undergrad. I also happen to be a gigantic Disney nerd. I got bored one day and started humming while working in the shop. When a mind gets off its leash

Perhaps divided by age? Classical and contemporary? Not sure. Comments? Suggestions? 


EDIT: GROUP SUGGESTIONS 

Well I think if we had as a subreddit it would be easier to control rather than a GoogleDocs/an FAQs. Also it means we could reach out to other theatre related subreddits because I know they receive a lot of unwanted posts of similar context. It would just make over all traffic flow.

idledebonair (one of the moderators for r/theatre) said he/she would it in the sidebar. So we would have direct traffic from r/theatre. 


What's everyone thoughts of expanding it to Duet scene

Looking through the comments it seems that every posts title should look like this: **Genre(comic/dramatic), authors name, the page number/act and scene,  a quick play synopsis and character synopsis. Thoughts?

In the theatre world everyone keeps their monologues locked away. As if it were there own intellectual property. So I love the idea of our community helping each other and expand our art. Please this is a work in process and all your help is freakin appreciated and welcomed. I want this to be a group idea. 


EDIT: 

Alright guys! I've done my best to take in everyones ideas! 
Introducing! [r/monologue](http://www.reddit.com/r/monologue)
With the help of r/TheoryOfReddit we thought it was best to go with a subreddit!

And you

While our work is hard, know that you were brave.

When that civilian dreams, they aim for security and domestication, not what they want to do. Which, in it's own way, is fine.

My area of theatre is circus/physical theatre/dance cross over's
Here is my words or wisdom for you

* **Very Important** READ THE CASTING BRIEF.  Seriously.  I am looking for skill X. Therefore I don't want people applying with skill Y, *available with no skills but willing to learn if selected* No. I'm not even going to look at your CV.  Along the same lines, don't ask questions when the answer is in the brief. I don't have time and it makes me think you're an idiot. 

* Sell yourself! I hate reading emails apologising or making excuses. You are the commodity you are trying to sell! Imagine you are selling something, this function isn't that great but I suppose it works"".  Along the same lines, don't admit it's your first time applying for something (again like I got today).  You don't need to lie, but telling me you don't know what you're doing is not a great start. 

* CV's - 2 pages MAXIMUM.  I don't bother reading past 2 pages, and it really shouldn't be at the top of your CV, I will stop reading.  (sounds' harsh but when you have 200 applicants or more, you just don't have time). 

* Show reels - please don't use a badly lit shaky poor quality hand cam footage. I stop watching.  Put some effort and if need be money into producing a nice show reel. I am more likely to be interested in good show reels than people who you can barely make out. 

* Websites.  It doesn't have to be great

I think its bullshit.

Why do people feel the need to judge me when I say I am an actor for myself? I know its importance, go into filmmaking. I do it because it makes me happy. I do it because it makes me feel. I am not good at expressing myself in real life. I don't have friends or family. I don't have strong opinions on politics or topical issues. But when I am a character, I do. When I am someone else I have a voice. 

I can finally cry for my mother when she had cancer. I can finally feel remorse for not connecting with my family. I can finally find a purpose to genuinely smile not because I am nervous or being polite. I do it because it is the only thing that makes me feel alive.

Real life is always playing the game. The stage is the only thing that is real.",self,t5_2quc9,1357878688.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Theatre/comments/16czgo/is_it_selfish_to_say_i_do_theatre_for_myself/

1338176534.0,u874s,"Regarding the Various Theatre Subreddits (""Splinter Groups"")",MacBeth_in_Yellow,16,1,12,"Greetings

You'll notice that some of them are fairly active. For example, three years as a community, and has new posts as recent as six hours ago--although it still doesn't seem to garner a great deal of commentary under each post. This subreddit--/r/theatre--is much the same way. Other subreddits have moderate participation, such as /r/techtheatre.

The subreddit that I've been moderating, maintaining participation is a challenge that we haven't found an effective solution for.

Many of the theatre subreddits are dead. Notice /r/thetechies (no posts), /r/monologue, had five posts given within the first days of its creation, and stopped completely. There is also, notably, /r/monologues (a small but subtle distinction), created seven months prior

Now, at least read the ideas and thoughts of others. But there are some problems here:

First, and significantly fewer actually participate in it. Theatre needs talent and dedication to survive. With so few in any given area out there to make it happen, deciding to saturate an area with more separate theatre groups than can be actively supported by both available talent and interested patrons, one or more of these groups are doomed to eventual failure.

Reddit is going to work the same way. It doesn't help that individual redditors are only allowed so many subscriptions on a single account. If any single redditor is to be expected to subscribe to more than a few theatre-related subreddits, trying to do something substantial with /r/playclub, but so far our success has been limited.

What this really boils down to is this: before starting a new subreddit, that there isn't already an existing subreddit with the same goal you have in mind.

Second, more active, subreddits. Maybe some of the ideas for collected monologues could, for example, be posted in /r/theatre. Perhaps someone might start a blog collecting possible monologues and post a monthly link to /r/theatre. Maybe someone might volunteer to create a FAQ containing more of the long-term useful information for one of these subreddits.

Further, take a lot of work) or looking into deleting them completely. I have no idea how to delete a subreddit (assuming it can be done at all), but some cleanup might help unify the existing redditors with a theatre interest.

Finally, we should be open to suggestion and discussion regarding this issue. But I've noticed that there is some local frustration with the monthly thread on ""hey, let's start a new theatre subreddit!"", so I know it's not just me.

2) Does the typical college education (especially undergraduate level) really provide much benefit to the young actor

3) Are NFP theatres that rely on donations to run their seasons really a good thing?  From my perspective, or whatever else, should you really be taking government money?

4) Finally, Video Games, and sports, how do you get more people to a theatre?

1329076147.0,pmd0i,Technical Internship Interview Ideas/Tips,Psyko_Koolaid,18,2,14,"I want to begin by saying that I am in no way the ultimate authority on this

First things first, and I’m not going to brutally interrogate you.  I say this because I had many interactions this weekend where people were so nervous that their hands were shaking throughout the interview. I may not exactly look soft and cuddly, but I’m also not Santa Fe Opera. (Not that they are terrifying in any way either, just using a well known name to make a point.) The worst thing that could happen to you in the next 10 minutes is that you don’t impress me. While that isn’t desirable, it’s not a reason to torture yourself.


My next bit of advice may seem obvious but be aware of the time constraints. If this is an event where interviews are tightly scheduled do your best to stick to it. Be on time, but I don’t want that to be the bulk of a first interview. Pick out a few key pages and explain the relevant parts until about 1 minute before your slot ends. I will always ask questions if I have them.


Do your research
I saw a lot of freshman and sophomore students who had a resume full of any credit they could list. I understand the necessity of doing this in your first few years. I had to do it too. Several times when I asked these students what they specialized in or what they were looking for they would answer, but I want you to have a passion for a more specific area within it. Pick an area that suits your strengths, or that you want to hone your skill in. *In my opinion* there is nothing wrong with saying something like, “I got my start as a carpenter, but I’ve developed an interest in electrics so I’ve also been taking as many electrician positions as I can in the past year.”


My last bit of advice is to be excited and engaged. I’m likely doing interviews all day. You’re likely to be doing the same thing. If you come to me with zero confidence or are so anxious that you can’t hold a conversation it doesn't give me much to go with in terms of approximating your abilities or personality. If you’re really tired, look me in the eyes and smile. If I can’t get you engaged in the interview I’m likely to lump you in with the mob of people who I know I interviewed, but can’t remember a thing about. Don’t barrage me with fake pep, but be warm and honest. If my BS meter goes off that is the first thing I’m going to remember. I like to challenge people. If I’m asking a lot of questions it’s because I’m trying to get you to break out of the standard, ‘safe’ responses. I want you to sell yourself as a whole person, not just as your resume.
Again, I feel that the some of the general ideas are useful in any interview.


**tl;dr**

* 1. Be calm. It’s an interview not an interrogation.
* 2. If you only have 10 minutes
* 3. Know who you’re talking to.
* 4. Be well rounded
* 5. Be confident and honest. I want to hire a person

I'm an undergraduate with a focus in directing with a decent amount of directing and assistant directing credits under my belt. I'll be graduating in December - this fall is my final semester of undergrad and I've been given a gallery-level production to direct which is normally reserved for MFA directors.

I love directing theatre and I know it's what I want to do for a living. However, chance, and connections. As of now, I know that unless some completely random and incredible opportunity presents itself, I'll be moving back in with the folks come December while applying to every possible theatre employment, internship, and apprenticeship opportunity available in the Chicago area in the upcoming months

Right now some of my top and most hopeful choices include an apprenticeship or internship at Steppenwolf, or Chicago Shakespeare Theatre, and trying to work with the Neo-Futurists. I know that I'll have a decently strong resume as well as letters of recommendation but in the long run that still probably won't mean much.

From all of you who have gone through the same struggle of finding work in the theatre, so even getting advice on what type of feasible theatre-related day jobs to look for to pay the bills while finding a show to be involved with at night would be helpful.

Basically, thank you!",,False,self,t5_2quc9,False,,

The concept is to condense the WHOLE theatrical experience into...you guessed it...24 hours. From the moment the actors audition to the performance the next night, direct, and put a show together.

Our process is this: There are generally 5 teams of writers and directors before the experiment takes place. The actors audition, the actors and directors go home, as the writers stay all night to write a 10-15 show. When the actors and directors come back in the morning, they are given a show they have never seen and spend the day blocking, rehearsing, and  setting up any tech for that nights performance.

I can't be the only one who thinks this is a bit excessive. He's asking us to take time off of work to rehearse, he would want this show to be the best it could possibly be, but this level of rehearsal can very quickly burn out the cast, which could in turn cause safety problems with the level of fighting in this show. And since we're not an equity company, there's no one I can go to (other than possibly the stage manager, which probably wouldn't do much in this instance) and talk about this issue. Is there something else I can do, or do I have to go straight to the source?

There are 4 stages to the overall audition process

1. General auditions where you perform 2 contrasting monologues and maybe a song (if they ask).

2. Out of the general auditions they call back anywhere from  3-15 people. But that is a bit of an estimate from talking with them. At the call back you perform in front of the teachers. You play improv games and ask you a couple questions.

3. They a few people from the callback group to stay for personal interviews. Just because you didn't get a callback doesn't mean you're no longer being considered. 

and finally. 

4. Out of all the callbacks on each audition day

Dear members and friends: today we begin the next phase of the Valley Free Radio (VFR) Theater Project. Last summer we planted the seeds of this endeavor at a fundraising meeting, we were met with hearty cheers and encouragement. We found immediate support from the local theatre group Serious Play! who in turn pitched the idea to us of a first performance of “Love, Anarchy, and Other Affairs,” by Jessica Litwak. This is a play about the life and loves of Emma Goldman, and which has been performed in New York and other locals, and the playwright and lead actress is living here in the Valley

Emma Goldman, plus an early feminist, labor activist and radical thinker in all ways. The play traces a short period in her life when she was on the run from the law, and fearing for her life. She was a Russian immigrant factory girl who became a labor activist/organizer and fiery orator on the speaker circuits in the early 1900's. She fought for free speech, women's right and free love long before those concepts were popular. We hope to bring her story to you and wider audiences through the medium of radio theater.

There are of course significant costs for making this happen, pay actors, etc. but we believe the end product will be outstanding, and will build strong support and acclaim for the station.

But this cannot all happen with the support of only a few of us. It will truly take a large majority of us shoulder to shoulder pushing forward to reach this goal. There is much you can do. First and foremost, plus further descriptions of the play, the actors, the playwright, and what we are trying to achieve.

For the past year and a half, but that urgency landed me in the ICU and with lasting health issues. Now as I'm trying to make sense of everything and get back to work, I wonder if there are better ways to make thoughtful work in Theatre. Is getting an MFA and trying for a teaching gig a safe bet, or would the debt be too risky? What about day jobs? I tend to fill my daylight hours with scenic painting or props fabrication, but the pay varies considerably and the work is not reliable. My partner does not make enough money to support us both. Currently, I have 5 projects to finish by mid-January and that is too many to have a full-time job on top of. When I got out of school, I was desperate to take all the gigs I could so I could build my portfolio and move to a bigger city but now I am seriously second-guessing myself. Ending up with an IV in my arm again and six weeks of bedrest is not an option again.

Now here's the thing: It's (late) Saturday right now. I have an audition for all three of next semester's shows on Tuesday. One of these three is a musical, just leaving it at that.) and I didn't feel like this was the time to start. (I'm defiantly looking ahead at audition material for next year's musicals though.)

So, that those of us doing the first option do 1 contemporary monologue and 1 classical. This is because of our 2 non-musicals, one is Servant of Two Masters. So that's what I did, and I have a serious monologue from And Then There Were None and a humours one from Two Gentlemen of Verona. The former I have down pat, but the latter one is really stressing me out. I'm really not the best Shakespeare person, and I feel like this monologue, despite the contemporary/classical request

So, Tuesday's almost here and I might not be 100% if I perform the classical one. What should I do? I'm sorry for any confusion or anything in this post but this is REALLY stressing me out, especially with Christmas Carol right around the corner.

1329690435.0,pwxfe,I just watched The Lady From Dubuque (Signature Theatre Company),SansPulp,8,1,2,"I don't even know what to say.

I went to the theatre on a whim. I'm studying film here in New York to round out my theatre degree I got back in Canada, I've been feeling a little useless in the Canadian theatrical scene lately. I'm in that stage of my life where I'm watching my friends get roles while I get none, and am forced to self produce and write and direct to get any kind of work and exposure to the community. And in NYC, it feels like the same thing. I'm not getting cast in these student films though I eat, sleep, and breathe this art form, while my friends go out drinking every night, never remember their lines, nor am I difficult to work with. I'm a decent looking guy, and emoting

While I've been here, but I get this sense of alienation everywhere I go. I read earlier today on Reddit that the French have this  saying about wanting to jump when you stand on a ledge. The Call of the Void. And I've been feeling that a lot lately, every time I stand on a bridge or a tall building or a subway platform. And I'm just living in my head, trying to find, I don't know, some reason? And I've been going to a lot of plays and comedy shows and movies here alone, because the friends I've made only seem to want to go to clubs, and I don't suffer a paralyzing fear of dancing, catch up on my sleep

Today I woke up feeling well rested and decided to check out a matinee of Blood Knot by Athol Fugard at the Signature Theatre Company. Putting a serious wrench in that, and now I have no credit card, so I have to show up at the theatre and hope they have tickets, or make **firstworldproblems**. Lo and behold, Blood Knot was sold out, but there were some tickets left for The Lady From Dubuque. I didn't know anything about the play, but I knew Albee was a 3 time Pulitzer winner, and I was down here anyway

I read the billboard outside the theatre and thought Albee sounded a bit pretentious, I texted a friend back home, and said that the play was witty and neat, and the direct address was alienating and challenging, and whatever else.

Then the second act came.

Whatever I say about what Mr. Albee made me feel in this second act would be reductive. The best metaphor I can make is that he put his fist inside my chest and opened up his fingers. I...I don't know, I paced around the theatre out of breath, wondering if I was going to cry or laugh or scream. I flipped through a dozen books in the bookstore, considered getting a drink, and finally walked to the bathroom. When I did, I passed one of the actresses. My face contorted into a dozen shapes, and I said ""great show"", devoid of any sound. She cocked her eyebrow at me and passed me by

After I gathered myself up in the washroom, and the actress I just passed. I lurked in the shadows, peering and glaring at him, both out of admiration and contempt, contempt that he just divided my life into the moment before I saw his show and the moment after I saw his show. I browsed his history on the display screen not 5 feet behind him, which in retrospect, is one of the weirdest things I've ever done. I then went and talked to one of the girls at the concierge desk, saying ""Is that him? Is that Edward? Is that the man who destroyed me?"", let alone the creator. But I lingered in the room long enough for me to realize what had just happened, I'm not sure what

I'm sorry for the length of this rant, but a feeling inside me compelled me to write, so I did. Has anyone else ever had this feeling after walking out of a show when they never thought they could? Tell me I'm not alone.

A little Background: Texas is a show that takes place in the Palo Duro Canyon

I have worked for Texas twice, a stagemanager, asked me to cover for one of her nights, a contract was thrown at me and they were basically like ""Welcome to the season."" They did this because they didn't hire enough people at the beginning of the season. I believe they are at least 3-4 technicians down from last year. (That already shows you how organized they are).

Usually following each show, wasting thousands of gallons of water during a drought, smart.

Before I continue, because of this he thinks he has a right to step into the show and do whatever he wants with it. Oh, and did I mention he plead guilty to endangering a child while being charged with sexually assaulting a child?

http://amarillo.com/stories/022102/new_batson.shtml

http://amarillo.com/stories/022202/new_forbatson.shtml

One of the conditions being he has no contact with anyone under the age of 17? Huh

What happened last night was the straw that broke the camel's back so to speak. Joe, fired our Technical Director, a man with SIXTEEN years of experience, fourteen in outdoor theater, six out at Lost Colony, (the most well-known and longest running out door drama in the United States) and gave his job to, you guessed it, they gave the job to someone who has NEVER worked in a theater before in his entire life.

And then they have the gall to have a “We’re all a family and have to stick together” meeting afterwards while all of us are standing there
Do not work for these people

I'm attending a state school here in the American mid-west with a fairly good reputation for it's drama program.  All throughout high school and even into college I've been a theatre rat, acting, stage managing, whatever.  I even hold down a job at a local PAC as their house stage hand and general technician.  My problem is that when I first came to college I wasn't so sure about my future so I opted for a degree oriented to the pure sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Biology) thinking such a degree would have the potential to get me a job just about anywhere.  Having tackled o-chem, lots of physics and genetics

My unique problem is that I'm already a junior and, but not any less.  So by the time I were to get out of school, I would be pushing 50k.  I desperately want to switch gears and go for what I love doing and be around theatre people the rest of my life, but I'm not sure I could make the payments on a technician's salary once I graduate.  The problem gets even worse when talking about grad school - a place I would like to attend someday as well.  So r/theatre, anyone have a similar experience they'd like to share to give me some inspiration on what to do with myself?  I'd really appreciate it :)


EDIT:
I guess I wasn't too clear before.  I currently work in a PAC when I'm not in school so I am getting that supplementary education.  However, with regard to my current major (zoology), I'm really not enjoying it that much and to be perfectly honest, I haven't really met a single person I've had a good enough connection with to really want to form any sort of friendship outside of the normal meeting in class.  All my friends are either from high school or people I've met at my job at the PAC.  I can't help but feel like I'm missing out on the whole college experience.  So, at 80 / 125 hours needed to graduate, I'm really wishing that I would've done tech to begin with.  But alas, I did not and am having some serious doubts.  I'll probably be in another 2 years at least finishing up zoo, but, damn. :P  Thanks for listening to my rants,self

I'm not as familiar with plays as I am with musicals, but I want to see what else is out there.

Thank you so much!!
