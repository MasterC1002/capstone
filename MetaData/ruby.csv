**EDIT ONE:**

Thank you all for your help!

* [Heroku](http://heroku.com) seems like a really valuable way to push your stuff live on the web without worrying about setting up complicated web servers.
* [Ruby on Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/) are pretty good too.

I'm going to set up a simple app and see if I can get it going on Heroku and I'll share it here.

Thank you all again for all your help.

**EDIT TWO:**

Most useful command so far is:
    rails destroy scaffold [scaffold-name]

**EDIT THREE:**

After hours of fighting with pushing something live I've started from scratch using http://railstutorial.org/ and so far it's the best, I'll keep you updated. I've got a way to go (setting up the environment is so far what seems to be taking the most time). I'll get there.

THANK YOU ALL AGAIN. Seriously

**EDIT FOUR:**

Before everyone attempts to attack me, where we pay for what we use?

Being a nerd, a few friends have talked to me about the idea of commercializing it. I am not against the idea, but I'd like to get a broader sense of what the Ruby community wants before I go further with it.

Currently

* Dynos do not always run. If the routing mesh detects that a site is relatively inactive
* Static content. When your application is deployed, and without the speed penalty of having thin serve it.
* Cheaper pricing. I do not want to give hard numbers, database is still up for discussion but it will be a sliding scale instead of tier based.
* PHP support! Okay, but I had to do it anyway.

I started learning Ruby a few months ago and I bought myself a Microsoft Kinect Cam as an early X-Mas gift. Of course I'm using Linux (yes your OS-X is fine too) and don't even own an X-Box 360 ... so I started the hacking.

After a short time of fiddling with C

---- [this one](http://openkinect.org/wiki/Ruby_Wrapper#Sample_Code) ----

which was empty and so I decided to **post my first code snippet there**.

Sadly nobody reacted so I have to assume that this project is dead. But what about you? *Anyone interested in bringing some of the Kinect functionality to Ruby?*


**What ~~I~~ we managed to do:**

 * Control the Kinects motor
 * Control the Kinects LED
 * Get accelerometer data

**What is missing (tried but failed):**

 * Get an image from the RGB cam
 * Get an image from the depth cam
 * ~~Get accelerometer data~~



**TL;DR:** Started to develop a pure Ruby Kinect driver. Who wants to help?

----

    colors = %w[red orange yellow]

vs

    require ""set"" 
    colors = %w[red orange yellow].to_set

----

And you get good enough mileage out of just using `Array#include?`, `Array#uniq`, etc:

    colors = %w[red orange yellow]
    colors.include?(""green"") #=&gt; false
    colors &amp; %w[red blue violet] #=&gt; [""red""] 
    %w[red orange yellow yellow].uniq #=&gt; [red orange yellow]
    

`Array.include?` is often used as a guard so that arrays have unique elements

But to compare arrays

    [1, 2, 3, 3].uniq # true
    [1, 1, 2] # false
    [1, 1, 2].sort # true
    [1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3].to_set # true

----

However

    require ""set""
    class User
      ROLES = %w[banned member moderator admin].to_set
    end

I don't have much of a background in data structures outside of what I've been exposed to while teaching myself

* Are arrays overused compared to sets?
* Is it because of the `require 'set'` and syntactic baggage of sets compared to arrays? Ruby definitely turns the usage of sets into a deliberate process.
* Would Ruby benefit from a literal set notation like `{""red""

And my primary question:

* Is it generally best to just go with what seems to be the 'convention' of arrays-for-everything? Especially in team projects where nobody uses Sets? Using Sets adds another possibility to method signatures which might just increase overhead and type annotation in team projects. Especially since Sets look like they need intermediate Arrays on construction: `Set.new [1, 2, 3].to_set`.
* Is my assessment wrong? 

One of the reasons this came up is because I was doing a lot of Array comparison for a feature. I've been learning Scala on the side which got me used to thinking about using the right data structure for a particular collection.

## Why?

I was trying to parse a 7 GB XML file with the only tool I was used to at that point: Nokogiri DOM traversal. 

...Not gonna happen. After a google search

## Task

* Parse an 80mb XML file with 2, 68 nodes per parent) .
* For each user `&lt;row&gt;`

## Results:

    Ox DOM: 6 seconds (550mb)
    Ox SAX: 6 seconds (12mb)
    Nokogiri DOM: 13 seconds (900mb)
    Nokogiri SAX: 24 seconds (11.8mb)

FWIW: My Ox SAX script parsed the original 7 GB file with 127, 49sec. I wasn't even going to try either of the DOM scripts and the Noko SAX script hangs up early on at about the 8,000,000th node despite the CPU staying at 100% until I quit. So there might be a problem with my Noko SAX script.

## Takeaways:

* Walking Ox's DOM tree is manual enough to where you might as well use its less-nebulous SAX API
* It's crazy how a 80mb XML structure bloats up to 550mb and 900mb in memory once its parsed into a bunch of Ox::Element and Nokogiri::Element objects.
* It's pretty awesome parsing unlimited XML data with nothing more than 12mb of RAM.
* Ox's SAX API is better than Nokogiri's because Ox's method for extracting the value from a node is nicer. Nokogiri just calls a `characters(string)` method on node contents and it even includes the newlines and tab characters of the XML doc which you have to strip out.
* Noko leans on libxml
* If you ever really needed to parse a massive XML file and its data could be mapped to a DB in any way

I am a 32 year old with no college education. I currently work at a dead end job in a warehouse putting away boxes and making deliveries. I have always loved computers and have been making websites for friends and family for years. I never charged

Up until a few months ago I had been a little depressed where my life had ended up. When I found Ruby I thought maybe there might be a chance turn my hobby into a career. Currently I am on my second read through of Eloquent Ruby and have done the the Ruby tutorial. I practice and study every day. I try to come up with small projects to work on to try the new concepts I learn and to heIp me retain the what I read. I have been considering signing up for one of the many Rails dev camps to help accelerate my path into the industry.

My fear is that I'll never be taken seriously when I finally apply for a job. Mainly because I have no programing experience and I don't have a CS degree.

So tell me r/ruby... can I make this a reality? 

I'm not trying to become the next Zuckerberg or create the next Instagram. I just want a career where I love what I do and I have an opportunity to make a small difference in the world.

1325626386.0,o1ksk,Please explain this to me. My brain hurts.,obviousoctopus,25,1,35,"This is the author-provided solution to one of the ruby-kickstart exercises. So

The problem description:

    # My boss wanted to be able to specify what CSS class the body of the HTML output should have
    # based on which controller method was being accessed.
    # It fell to me to provide a method, would return a String that could handle the request
    # 
    # There are a few nuances
    # The String you return must be retained during the object's entire life
    # The method must be able to be called multiple times
    # The String you return should know how to add new classes: each class is separated by a space
    # The only method you need to worry about being invoked is the &lt;&lt; method.
    #
    # EXAMPLE:
    #   controller = ApplicationController.new
    #   controller.body_class                 # =&gt; """"
    #   controller.body_class &lt;&lt; 'admin'
    #   controller.body_class                 # =&gt; ""admin""
    #   controller.body_class &lt;&lt; 'category'
    #   controller.body_class                 # =&gt; ""admin category""
    #   controller.body_class &lt;&lt; 'page' &lt;&lt; 'order'
    #   controller.body_class                 # =&gt; ""admin category page order""
    # HINT: 
    #   The concat method will do the same thing as the &lt;&lt; method

And the provided solution (note

    class ApplicationController  
      def body_class    
        unless @body_class
          @body_class = String.new
          class &lt;&lt; @body_class
            def &lt;&lt;(str)
              concat ' ' unless length.zero?
              concat str
            end
          end
        end
        @body_class
      end
    end

Can anyone explain what is going on here? What does ""class &lt;&lt; @instance_variable_name""  do? Why is this definition wrapped in a condition wrapped in a method definition?


How are these addressed by the above?
# The String you return must be retained during the object's entire life (I guess using the @body_class instance variable)
# The method must be able to be called multiple times (I guess redefining the String concat ""&lt;&lt;"" method for this instance variable only... but what exactly is happening? Is the ""&lt;&lt;"" method being attached to the defined ""body_class"" method?

There is a [sessions](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro#Using%20Sessions) feature in sinatra but I don't think this is any actual security. This is just maintaining a state. 

I don't need to maintain a state because the app is AJAX based so once a user is on a page all the rest happens in the background. The main concern is how can I securely transfer data between the client and the sinatra app without someone in the middle sniffing the data? And how can I ensure that only authorized users are able to pull data from the sinatra server?
