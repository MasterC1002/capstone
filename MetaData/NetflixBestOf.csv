1312990453.0,jenqu,Best TV Shows on Netflix,Vitalstatistix,459,62,376,"* **Arrested Development** - One of the most original comedies ever filmed.  If you haven't watched it yet

* **Doctor Who** (reboot) - When the main character can travel through time and space, and story line.  Watch it and become a Whovian like the rest of us.  (And once you're done, check out **Torchwood**, a DW spin-off, also very good)

* **Mad Men** - The ultimate retro show that follows the life of Don Draper, smokes, and beautiful people dressed to the 9s, Mad Men is a portal into a different era.

* **Luther** - John Luther is a brilliant homicide detective with more than his fair share of extra-curricular problems.  Unlike many other shows/films that fall into the cop genre, Alice Morgan (played by Ruth Wilson) is simply amazing.  One season only, however with some googling you can easily find season two around the intertubes.

* **Jekyll** - Dr. Tom Jackman lived a relatively normal life for nearly 40 years.  He gets married in his late 30s, when all of a sudden he starts blacking out for long periods of time, waking up covered in blood or with a prostitute, not knowing what happened.  ""Jekyll"" offers superb acting by James Nesbitt, and an incredibly awesome take on an old tale.  Steven Mofatt wrote it, you should watch it.  Sadly there's only one season (although technically there still could be more in the future, but I doubt it).

* **Downton Abbey** - This generation's ""Upstairs/Downstairs"", next season is out in about 4 months), it offers some very intriguing story lines and fun look at the ridiculousness of the British aristocracy (and those who served them).  

* **Sherlock** - Steven Moffat does it again (seriously, as they tear through London tracking down clever and deadly killers.  One season (3 episodes) for now, but season 2 will be coming within the next few months.

* **Firefly** - Shut up and watch it.  And then watch Serenity.  And then watch it all again.  

* **30 Rock** - Not sure that this needs any introduction.  Simply put

* **Parks &amp; Recreation** - Although Parks &amp; Rec. probably has a few less followers than 30 Rock

* **The Tudors** - A wonderful costume drama about the court of Henry VIII, foreign war, or the birth of a male heir, The Tudors is a fun and sexy look at the royal court during the Reformation.  History buffs especially--it's a blast (and fairly accurate). 


* **The League** - This show was one of the best surprises of the past year as it is LOLLLL level of funny.  It's essentially about five 35 year old friends and their fantasy football league (and other exploits).  It's simple but hilarious.  Even if you don't do fantasy sports it's hilarious

* **Spartacus Blood &amp; Sand** - This is the greatest porn with a story line you'll ever see!  But really, so season 2 was re-written late and isn't quite as good as 1, but still worth the watch.

* **Top Gear (UK)** - You don't need to be a car person to enjoy Top Gear, who are all middle-aged Brits who are very different from each other.  Almost every episode they are given some whacky challenge (like taking a car and giving it the capability to float the English Channel to France, which they do) and the banter between the three of them is great to watch.  

* **Party Down** - A hilarious gem that follows wanna-be actors in LA working as caterers trying to make ends meet.  Not quite as good as Arrested Development

* **Pushing Daisies** - It's rather difficult to describe Pushing Daisies, part detective, part...well, hell, I don't know.  But it's fun and as charming as any show on television.  

* **Dead Like Me** - George and her gang of colleagues are all dead, this makes for some completely ridiculous and morbidly awesome dark comedy.  It's tough not to fall in love with all of the characters.  Just don't watch the movie!

* **Better Off Ted** - Similar in many ways (although not quite as in-depth) to Arrested Development

* **MI-5** - As smart as they come for spy thriller shows.   I haven't seen every season

* **Any Human Heart** - It's tough to describe this short Masterpiece Classic show, the art trade and espionage, brushing shoulders along the way with a stunning assortment of iconic personalities"".  Has some flaws for sure, but it's worth the watch.

That should be enough for now then hopefully.  Please add any more suggestions in the comments!

1312925864.0,jdx3p,9 Movies New On Netflix Instant You Should Watch and Why You Should Watch Them,meschmie,232,69,75,"[Link to Original post.](http://www.20somethingawesome.com/tag/new-on-netflix/)

**Misery (1990)**

Director: Rob Reiner (This is Spinal Tap

Starring: James Caan (Elf, The Office(TV))

Genre: Thriller

Why You Should Watch It: Based off the 1987 Stephen King novel

**The Usual Suspects (1995)**

Director: Bryan Singer (X-Men

Starring: Kevin Spacey (American Beauty, In Treatment(TV)), Chazz Palminteri (Poolhall Junkies, Bullets Over Broadway), Stephen Baldwin (The Best Brother)

Genre: Crime

Why You Should Watch It: Keyser Söze. Keyser Söze. Keyser Söze. Keyser Söze.  Who the fuck is Keyser Söze? The fun isn’t in knowing, also, it’s a fucking awesome movie.

**Die Hard 2: Die Harder. (1990)**

Director: Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger

Starring: Bruce Willis (Ashton Kutcher’s ex-husband inlaw)

Genre: Action

Why You Should Watch It: Seriously, then I got nothing for you because I have never seen this movie. It is a John Mclane joint though, so terrorists get dead and America gets saved.

**Rain Man (1988)**

Director: Barry Levinson (The Natural)

Starring: Dustin Hoffman, Foreign Films)

Genre: Drama

Why You Should Watch It: Douchebag Tom Cruise. Autistic Dustin Hoffman. Four Oscars: Best Picture, Best Actor (Hoffman). I feel no need to continue.

**The Terminator (1984)**

Director: James Cameron (Blue People Pocahontas

Starring: Arnold Schwarzenegger (“Who is your daddy, Michael Biehn (Aliens, The Abyss)

Genre: Action

Why You Should Watch It: “Your clothes... give them to me

**Spaceballs (1987)**

Director: Mel Brooks (The Producers

Starring: Mel Brooks, Bill Pullman (Independence Day, Casper), Rick Moranis (Currently serving 2 years for child endangerment)

Genre: Comedy

Why You Should Watch It: Always on the list for top parody movies of all time, but it was the first Start Wars movie parody, setting up current spoofs from the likes of Robot Chicken and Family Guy. Where would Seth Green and Seth MacFarlane be today without Mel Brooks paving the way into the future of creating Star Wars material that people actually want to watch? Creating Star Trek parodies, that’s where…*shivers*

**The Dirty Dozen (1967)**

Director: Robert Aldrich (The Longest Yard)

Starring: Lee Marvin, John Cassavetes

Genre: Action

Why You Should Watch It: The Dirty Dozen follows 12 convicted felons who are summoned to serve in an experimental WW2 platoon to carry out a specific mission involving killing German generals. There is drama, shit blows up, and people get killed. You never thought you could enjoy a 1967 film so much, until you realize The Graduate and Cool Hand Luke came out the same year.

**Lethal Weapon 1 &amp; 2 (1987

Director: Richard Donner (The Omen

Starring: Mel Gibson (Homophobic, Danny Glover, Gary Busey (1), Joe Pesci (2)

Genre: Action

Why You Should Watch It: Honestly, “Shit to watch on Netflix Instant”.  If you enjoy other Inter-racial buddy cop films such as Beverly Hills Cops 1-7, these two films are right up your alley. They made a total of four of these, so they can’t be too terrible, right?

**XXX (2002)**

Director: Rob Cohen (The Fast and the Furious)

Starring: Vin Diesel

Genre: Mindless Action

Why You Should Watch It: I can’t in good conscious actually recommend this film unless you have no interest in thinking, or a good way to start the night out with a fun drinking game. How about, every time Vin Diesel says something, awesome? Get ready for fun.

**Trainspotting (1996)**

Director: Danny Boyle (28 Days Late

Starring: Ewan McGregor (Star Wars I-III, Jonny Lee Miller (Hackers), Kevin McKidd (Grey’s Anatomy)

Genre: Crime

Why You Should Watch It: Academy Award Nomination. British Academy Film Award Nominations and won Best Screenplay. Ranked 10th in the Brithish Film Institues top 100 British Films. A cult classic. Ewan McGregor. Ranked 7th best motion picture soundtrack in history by Vanity Fair. A great depiction of the depressing highs and lows of heroin addiction. The list goes on. Just watch the damn movie already.

**Bonus Television Show-**

**Mad Men (2007-Season 5 coming 2012)**

Creator: Matthew Weiner

Starring: Jon Hamm

Genre: Drama

Why You Should Watch It: This swell time piece has won thirteen Primetime Emmys, you won’t be disappointed. It has been known to cause depression in those who are not able to drink while on the job, so be careful out there folks.
