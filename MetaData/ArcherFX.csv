http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5wy7iDNcP1rwcwobo1_500.png

2) He helps EVERYONE. Including fixing Katya, Barry's ship, he puts the mind control chip in Len Drexler's head so that ISIS wouldn't be sold, the list goes on.
http://i.imgur.com/4rWnOyh.jpg

3) He is not a womanizer and is a devoted ""husband"".
http://i.imgur.com/cAlE40O.jpg

4) He even helps animals find true love!
http://i.imgur.com/0PVdWAW.jpg

5) When not helping others he spends his time focused on bettering himself. (Ex: Y-Y-ZED and scientific experiments)
http://i.imgur.com/HqnQ1Lu.jpg

6) When Archer called from Canada after he ""lost"" his passport
(Can't find a decent photo for this one... so... http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0ztgukbmz1qkthyyo1_500.png)

7) When in a relationship with Cheryl
http://i.imgur.com/Jq1m2.jpg

8) Making Archer's car in ""Drift Problem"" the ultimate spy car.
http://i.imgur.com/TOH9O.jpg

9) The only crimes he commits against ISIS are in the name of retrieving what's his and nothing more. (Ex: his 401k)
http://i.imgur.com/CGJuyff.jpg

10) He is not a ""serial"" killer.

My name is Domirillo.

It’s a pleasure to meet you.

Would you care for a drink?

Since it’s a little chilly outside

Excellent.

Let me go ahead and get the ingredients together here.

First

What? This?

It’s margarita mix.

No
Who I think maybe invented the margarita.

Fine, citric acid, sodium citrate, sodium benzoate, cellulose gum, gum acacia, polysorbate 60, glycerol ester of wood rosin

...yeah, and it says right on the bottle, “Pair the refreshing taste of Margaritaville Lime Margarita Mix with Margaritaville Tequila and get ready to enjoy a premium margarita with every spin of the blender.”

See

.

.

.

Fuck

I guess I need to take a few steps back

I’m Domirillo. I work on Archer. At one point during the making of season 2, with a bit of history of the drink, how to make it, and any other esoterica that doesn’t really have to do with the show, because nobody likes spoilers.

The idea is simple: If you were Archer, you should probably be drinking then too. I’m trying to make that easy for you. Plus, if you stop drinking for too long, the cumulative hangover might literally kill you.

OK

I talked about the [history and possible origin of the margarita](http://www.reddit.com/r/ArcherFX/comments/klmop/the_tip_s3e02_heart_of_archness_part_ii/) back in Season 3

Over at the [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/30/the-best-margarita-mixes_n_1459430.html), for a party or whatever, and thus don’t feel like squeezing limes all day like a field hand. 

While I appreciate that this scenario might happen every now and then, I guess unless you actually ARE Archer, in which case, you wouldn’t be making them anyway. You’d be having your valet make them, and he’d be squeezing every single margarita by hand from nothing but Boca Chita Key Limes.

There are only 5 things that need to be in your 

**MARGARITA**

 * 1.5 oz (45 ml) Tequila 
 * .5 oz (15 ml) Cointreau (orange liqueur) 
 * 1 oz (30 ml) Fresh squeezed lime juice
 * Large ice cubes
 * Kosher Salt for the rim of the glass

Pour some salt onto a small dish. Cut a lime in half, Cointreau, and tequila in a cocktail shaker, with ice. Shake vigorously. Pour over ice into your pre-salted glass. Garnish with a lime wedge if desired. (Hint: you desire it).

.

.

.

**ALTERNATE**: Drink Irish Cream out of the bottle. 

**FOOD SUGGESTION**: Honestly

It’s a burger.

If you want to have a little cookout
