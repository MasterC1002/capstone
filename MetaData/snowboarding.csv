That being said, and it's just getting ridiculous. When someone makes a post about a cool trick they did, or some crazy pow day they had, nobody wants to read a thread full of comments about how the person's an idiot for not wearing a helmet.

I don't think there is a single person in this subreddit who isn't aware of the safety benefits of wearing a helmet. It is, shut the hell up, please. It's not your fight, and you have no reason to think you have a say in how they live their life. It's their choice, and that's the end of it.

This is all coming from someone who wears a helmet every time he rides

I don't subscribe here but I thought you guys could help since you are fellow Snowboarders. My friend Jack was injured in a friends yard while trying to do a back flip off a Snow jump. He landed on his neck and is (temp. Hopefully) paralyzed from the chest down. His parents are trying to work with insurance to send him to Atlanta Georgia where the best rehabilitation facility in all of the US is located. His mother will move down there to be with him through his planned 6 week program. So

1333595240.0,ru2l4,7 months ago you guys convinced me to get into snowboarding. heres my story you probably dont want to read but it is here anyways,ace9213,138,18,38,"I moved to Colorado for school and you guys convinced me to get into snowboarding. A shitload of money later I had all my gear and season pass. It was a 2 our drive to the resorts but it was worth it. I went up not even knowing how to snowboard

My first run was out at A-Basin their opening week I believe. I thought they would have a green open but they didn't! I literally had snowboarded once 5 years ago and just went up the mountain and had to do a pretty steep blue. It took me forever to get down

I was pretty upset and was wondering if I blew all this money on something I will end up not enjoying. It sucked when I had a group of guys give me shit while I was falling down the mountain. They called me a gaper and I had no clue what it meant so when I got home I checked out online what it was. Not sure why they called me a gaper when I was actually trying very hard and falling down on my face every time I got up. I never stood around and pretended to be good or anything. I did have bright yellow pants so maybe thats why they called me it but whatever.

Not wanting to give up that easy I waited until breck opened up and I just practiced all day going down the bunny slope linking my turns together. At the end of the day I had figured it out and was able to stop well

My next weekend out I was feeling good and went straight up for a nice long blue run. It was tough shit and I nearly crapped my pants at how steep the slopes can actually get. I can remember getting to the top of a hill and stopping and looking down, I got up and went at it. I caught and edge and went flying down on my back and had snow pile up in the back of my pants. Okay so maybe I'm not as good as I thought! Haha

I snowboarded alone every time just enjoying the time to myself and enjoying the scenery. I'm a texas boy so mountains are totally out of my element! All the rad lingo is out of my element as well! I did have a few people ask where I was from after hearing me say y'all and stuff! I just laughed it off and said I'm bring texas to the slopes! I know

Anyways it turned into my thing I would go do alone on the weekend if I didn't have too many studies to do. I would test myself each time out and try harder and harder terrain. What was so amazing was that I could see myself getting better and it was the best feeling in the world. No one ever taught me a thing so it was a huge feeling of accomplishment.

By the end of the season I was doing very well for my standards. I could easily take down any blue and was doing some black runs. I 50-50 my first box and made it off alive. I was able to do little jumps and stomp the landing. I can remember my first time going down a run in the park. I hadn't been more terrified my whole time snowboarding. I was afraid people would make rude comments at me again but I finally just went for it. I mean that little 9 year old kid can do it right!? I lined up for the first box, and I landed it! Wow I couldn't believe it. It was one of the highest highs I have ever had. I just rode down the rest of the mountain with the biggest grin on my face since I got my Nintendo 64 for christmas as a child. 

I went back up the mountain to go do it again. This time I maybe had a little too much confidence and I fell when I jumped off the end. I got the wind kicked right out of my

So by the end of this season I have conquered a lot and have faced many challenges. Snowboarding really taught me to stick with something and work very hard and you will have a great outcome. Even when you have people harassing you don't let them get you down, or anything. It is just me and the mountains. Seeing my hard work start paying off was one of the best feelings in the entire world. I mean I literally knew nothing about snowboarding and I just threw myself into it and stuck it out and have learned a lot about snowboarding and myself too. 

So thank you to the people who answered my stupid noob questions six months ago. Without y'all helping me out I may have never discovered something so amazing.",self,t5_2qi0t,False,,default,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/snowboarding/comments/ru2l4/7_months_ago_you_guys_convinced_me_to_get_into/
