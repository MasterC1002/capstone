We stepped outside and noticed white smoke coming from the metal storm doors going into the basement.  The landlord walked by and calmly told us that he had a small fire in the basement and proceeded to walk inside. She grabbed her purse and I grabbed one of my cameras thinking we would be displaced for a couple of hours at most.

That was the last time we would ever step foot inside that aparment.  It was smokey when I ran back in to grab my camera bag and harddrive with all of my work on it.  She didn't think to get any of her stuff and we left the motorcycles parked where they were (though in hindsight we should have moved them).

Smoke started billowing through the cracks quicker and quicker and you can see in the photos that the fabric is beginning to burn and turn the smoke a yellow / orange color.  Pikachu is still waiting to be rescued at this point.

We hear breaking glass and see pikachu ripped out of the window

It is atone point that I notice the roses on the kitchen table become engulfed in flame and at that point I knew it was all over.  We watched flames start licking at the ceilings, everywhere.  We stepped away and went to New Wave and came back an hour and a half later to find that the wall had collapsed and a man had lost his life battling the fire.

My friend Kevin was shot in the neck during a robbery in Northern Liberties on November 15th. He is still in critical condition. His spine was shattered and the fear of him becoming a quadraplegic is almost certain.

If anyone has any information, right on Brown St, and left on Bodine Street. He lives on the corner of Fairmount and Bodine. If anyone along the way has cameras, please let the detectives know. Thank you.

Police Report:
Please be advised that last night, 2:46 AM, 6th District police responded to 911 calls of a person shot in the 700 block N. Bodine St. Upon arrival, police found a local resident lying on the ground outside 714 N. Bodine with a gunshot wound to the neck. Fire Medic unit #15 transported the victim to Hahnemann Hospital where he was listed in critical condition. Police were able to ascertain from the victim that he was walking home after going to a local bar to get something to eat, drink and watch the Monday Night football game. On the way home he was confronted by an armed male during an apparent hold up and was shot. The offender was described only as a short black male who fled south on Bodine St. Central Detective Division is investigating and is looking for possible video cameras in the area that may have captured the incident, victim or offender. Any information may be called into the Special Investigations Unit ,at 215-686-3047 or Central Detective Division at 215-686-3093

You:
Awesome Philadelphians who stopped to help me push my car up the hill in ninety five degree weather.

First two people stopped, and before I knew it a bunch of strangers were heaving my car up the hill and safely into a parking lot.  I've had a lot of bad luck lately and knowing that people care really helped lift my spirits.  

So thanks

The Delaware River Basin Commission is an intergovernmental body that is comprised of five voting members, Governor Corbett of Pennsylvania, Governor Markell of Delaware, and the Obama Administration represented by the Army Corps of Engineers.  For the Delaware River to be opened up to drilling, three out of the five have to vote yes on the draft regulations plan.  We need them all to reject the proposal and reject gas drilling and fracking.  

**There has never been a more urgent moment in the Northeast in the battle against fracking. ** 

Here are 4 ways that you can participate:

1) Call the the Governors from the member states and President Obama TODAY and tell them

* And the white house comment line is [202-456-1111](http://www.whitehouse.gov/contact)

2) Come to the DRBC meeting in person!

First and foremost, 50-some of you *actually have my telephone number*, and about 20 of you **know where I live**. If, for some reason, you think we’re trolling you or [secretly deleting comments to cover for racist friends](http://redd.it/k7jyr), there just *might* be another plausible explanation just around the corner. Of course, you could tell us how [you know everything about how reddit works](http://i.imgur.com/PNrTk.gif ""That picture is definitely photoshopped!"") and how we’re all racists ourselves

Also, certainly. But don’t think for one minute that you’ll be able to have a serious conversation with a troll.

Secondly, take this survey and tell us how awesome it would be to have a Jekyll &amp; Hyde meetup at the top of Liberty Two in October.~~ The idea would be that you can either come [super dressy](http://www.flickr.com/photos/64054156@N04/6091295760/) (Jekyll) or in an [awesome costume](http://www.flickr.com/photos/64054156@N04/5831266955/) (Hyde). We’d love to hear your comments, questions, and ideas, ~~so again take the survey~~ (and feel free to add comments below). Like the last Liberty Two meetup, you will need to RSVP with a name (but we’ll deal with that later).

**About the Meetup**

We'll start at **2pm** on **Saturday, so I'd like to focus on that (though, certainly, you won't be required to play anything). We will also have beer, soda, and some snacks - general mingling is certainly encouraged. This will be similar (and probably better) than [Liberty Two](http://i.imgur.com/ZACXo.jpg) (except for the view) - though with an earlier end time so people can go bar crawling if they want to.

**What you ""Need"" to Do**

""Need"" in quotes, all you *need* to do is show up. I do *humbly request*, however, that you do the following:

* **Bring $15 worth** of snacks, supplies (plates, cups, napkins, trash can liners, ice, coolers, etc.)
* **Bring a board game** / card game / playing cards / poker chips. I'd recommend against bringing a 7-hour strategy game like *Diplomacy*, *Monopoly DEAL*, and *Cards Against Humanity*, or light strategy like *Settlers of Catan* and *Ticket to Ride*.  
* ~~**Email RSVP4rPhilly** [at] hotmail.com and tell me what (if anything) you're bringing. If you want to bring something
* **RSVP** on the [redditgifts page](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/philadelphia-global/).  
* **Have FUN!**

Please feel free to post questions below. I will ask for some set up/tear down volunteers

Today Geoff and I met real angels on earth. Here is the story:


I am working with a family which needed 2 twin beds for their children. The children had no beds and were sleeping with their mom. When first I met with her all she wanted was for the kids to have their own beds

I worked to get the beds donated and got funds to pay for new mattresses and box springs. I discovered that I could get brand new beds
I contacted their customer service personnel for the South Philly store and secured directions on how to use an organization check and get the tax removed. 

Armed with all my documents and specific instructions on where to go to make the transaction
The two little ones 6 and 9 were waiting for us to bring their first beds ever at 3:30pm after school.


When we arrived

 He was talking to someone on his phone as I discussed the family situation with Geoff


What we didn't realize was a customer was listening carefully to the story and stood up

I composed myself as did Geoff and said that I would accept their kindness if the woman would give me her contact information so I could return the money via an agency check next week. She was hesitant but agreed to the arrangement. The manager also arranged a coupon that would cover the tax so the final charge would not include the tax.

I can host an event of up to 320 people with minimal costs. The location is in the Italian Market area. What I really would like to see is all of us coming together and contributing what we can to make this a fun time with more entertainment than just each other. Somebody already proposed a band to play at the party, fire, aerial gymnastics and others) who would probably be interested in participating. I am thinking of hosting the 1st meeting for this on Thursday evening around 6PM, maybe I can afford to order us some pizza. As far as the party itself - I am thinking early February. Let me know if you're interested in participating.

Update 1 - 1st meeting to plan out the basics - Thursday 1/12/12 6PM around the block of 8th Street and Christian Street - https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=br2v74smiem5enoar2lgt93sns%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/New_York - If you can come then please do. Those who confirm will receive the exact contact info.

**Update 2** - Due to unforeseen circumstances I am pushing this back until mid-March. Sometime around mid-February you should see a link for a survey about party details and that will allow me to see what days in March would work for most people. The way I see it is that there are a few advantages to this: 1) There are transitions at the place where I live and we have people moving in and out

I've been living with her because I have had no success with finding a job for the past ~2 years.  I currently work as a babysitter part-time (can even provide the family's contact information for further verification) and all of my earnings from this have gone toward my Fall tuition.  I literally have no money outside of this, but I am between degrees--my last one being in the Arts--and lack the experience that employers seek for hiring.]  My mother came to me today asking me to provide her with my tuition bill so that she can qualify for a withdrawal from her Vanguard account (she wanted the bill so that she could use it is part of her ""necessary expenses""--she is not contributing a dime to my education).  Her withdrawal is being used to pay for debts she has accumulated from a shopping addiction (I wish I were making this up.  I am pretty ashamed to even be admitting this to anyone, that this is my current situation.) I refused and was told I am no longer welcome under this roof.  I've included a screencap of a conversation with a friend over FB in which I detail the gist of the story; I'm trying to provide as much proof as I can.

I get paid from my nannying duties this week and can use the pay for an Amtrak ticket to move if necessary.

**EDIT 2:** It is 2:09AM right now, to the comments below and any that may be forthcoming, I have been replying to inquirers via PM.  I am not ignoring any response I get, just taking a personal route to my response.  
Thank you so much again.

**EDIT 3:** It is 11:23AM, and (2) I am sorry that many think this plea is way of keeping myself dependent on others.  I have to be honest in saying that I think, if you think this, you have no experience with a manipulative parent or guardian.  Giving in to my mother's request would be keeping myself dependent on a dysfunctional and destructive situation.  I wrote this post following an abrupt dismissal from my home, and I asked for a leg-up in the hope of getting away from this unhealthy situation.

Culture? Cross a truck stop with a Mountain Dew commercial and you'll have a good approximation.

Scenery? Okay, the rivers, and the historical architecture.

By the end of the day when we returned almost everything was gone from the sidewalk. I was so delighted to find that all of the associated envelopes were in the vestibule with cash in them!

So, people are good! Thanks for showing me the real, honest Philadelphia spirit!

This is Philadelpia's true shame, it's not due to corporatism neccessarily.  My whole life there has been a very visible homeless problem in Philadelphia, most that have been here will agree.

Here's where it gets worse, these people need help desperately.  The number of ""incidents"" among the very small Occupy Philly demonstartors is eyebrow raising to me.  Wether these incidents, are perpetrated by homeless Occupy Philly participants, or by local homeless unaffiliated does not matter, and really I have no idea who the guilty are.

When I visit the Occupy Philly camp

When I ask older philadelphian's why there are so many homeless in the city and why they all seems so visibly mentally ill, in 1987.

This guy came to my house

He had a written note

He tells me if the balance isn't paid they have to impound the car.  So he says he just needs $20 to pay the balance so her car doesn't get impounded

I'm close enough with my neighbor that loaning her $20 wouldn't be a problem so I figured what the hell.  We gave him the $20.

We called the phone number he left for the auto tow company (1-800-AUTO-TOW) and it rings to a tow company in Oklahoma.  The woman who answered knew exactly why we were calling

She advised we file a police report

Are you local?

Are you a Redditor? (optional)

Are you interested in meeting other friendly local ladies?


If the answer is yes to all, it's not a sexist, he-man hating club either. No I'm not trying to split the group (we love you guys!), so I'd never organize something to conflict with another meetup.


It's just a way for us to meet each other, I enjoy hanging out with the gentlemen variety, but sometimes... I just want to hang out with ladies. I've already met a few of you ladies and I think it's a shame I haven't gotten to know you better (Liz, Heather, Aleela, Beth, girl I met at the bowlup


A little about me: I've always been kind of a guys' girl (I guess because of my nerdy/geeky personality). Get along great with guys, I've matured a lot and have come to appreciate the feminine beings in my life. Currently, all my really close girlfriends either live out of state or are extremely busy with work/family, and so I just miss hanging out with the fairer sex. Plus I'm always up for meeting new cool peoples in general, and would be even better if they are women, since I don't know too many local women. And I don't mind putting myself out there, hence, awkward,  safe


So if you're a lady and you're interested in meeting more like-minded local ladies, so maybe we can organize an event around a common interest. 


Me: I'm kinda geeky (yeah we all are :D), reading. Love dancing--salsa, swing, cooking and eating, drinking.... just a few of my favorite things.


Also, would appreciate it!

**EDIT:** WOW! What an AMAZING response! I'm actually kind of overwhelmed--I honestly was expecting 10-15 interested ladies max. This is wonderful. I am keeping a spreadsheet of all the responses and as of today 9/13, lots of beers (since I saw beer mentioned numerous times), and overall good spot to chat and hang out. We can do something as early as end of September/beginning of October and probably keep this going once every 2/3 weeks or so. And if some of you hit it off, I can definitely see mini/spontaneous meetups happening more frequently--movie night, dinner night, whatever-activity night, etc. 

Ahh, or through email? Should we make a google group? Would love any ideas on how to do this most efficiently (welcoming advice from everyone, not just the ladies, hah). *ItHenceEverything* offered to help with planning since she plans a lot of meetups, I look forward to hearing from you, I'll PM you soon.",,self,,

This annoys me because they are literally stealing candy from kids. But I have no idea how to approach this. I have heard other neighborhoods have this problem as well (I live just off Baltimore ave near Cedar Park), since they live in apartments, and help back me up on my assertion that the candy is for kids.

Does anyone else have this problem and have they ever found a solution? 



**edit** after some great suggestions I have decided to hand out the bars individually, that I am low on candy and only have enough for kids who dressed in costumes, no adults. I thought of having a bowl of the candy I have left over from a party (smarties and laughy taffy), but decided against even facilitating the candy snatching behavior of adults.

1363545518.0,1ah5a5,"Text version of Mayor Nutter letter re ""Being White in Philly"" article",ohiohiohio,91,22,90,"Dear Ms. Landau:

This month Philadelphia Magazine has sunk to a new low even for a publication that has long pretended that its suburban readers were the only citizens civically engaged and socially active in the Philadelphia area. Its March cover piece, the negative stereotypes, the ignorant condemnations typically, and historically ascribed to African-American citizens into one pathetic, uninformed essay quoting Philadelphia residents, many of whose names either the author or the speakers themselves were too cowardly to provide. That the magazine thought a collection of these despicable, over-generalized, some of the residents of the nation's fifth-largest city who are quoted in the piece seem to have ignored every positive anecdote they might otherwise have shared about a positive experience with African-Americans in favor of negative stories, is lazy, compounding the sin of having allowed this article to be published in the magazine - and as a cover story

Anyone who reads a newspaper or walks through some of the city's poorer neighborhoods knows that the ""vast and seemingly permanent . . . underclass"" is not only black; the poverty rate in the City of Philadelphia is 28.4% and comprises not only African-Americans but Caucasians, the author of this essay, who notes that ""[w]hat gets examined publicly about race is generally one-dimensional, looked at almost exclusively from the perspective of people of color,"" commits the same sin in reverse, by examining race exclusively from the perspective of, apparently, first, as if merely saying that an article quoting the random thoughts of a random collection of people in selected areas of the city is worthy of publication makes it so. McGrath's second contention is that refusing to publish a piece about race would have rendered the problems of the city's ""underclass"" theirs

Indeed, 1997). However, trying to deconstruct the article's many logical fallacies not only is an exercise in futility but offers the piece unearned credibility. Obviously, unless the resident whose chair was stolen or pumpkin smashed actually witnessed these acts of vandalism being committed by an African-American person, an assumption by the victim or the author about the ethnicity of the perpetrator is patently foolish. Obviously, the many positive, crime-free experiences of the thousands of Temple University students of all ethnic groups, belie the cynical presumptions of a police officer whose job, might have used the criticism he received for calling his young male student, rather than interpreting it as evidence that ""no one at the school could do anything

Rather than raging against the abject ignorance reflected in this uninformed, uninspired, and thoroughly unimaginative lament, I believe we should take the opportunity this essay offers to conduct a more comprehensive, fact-intensive evaluation of the racial issues and attitudes that provide the prism through which not only Philadelphians, but Americans across the country, view the many challenges that confront us as a community and as a nation. I therefore request that the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations, among other duties
understanding among persons and groups of different races,"" conduct an inquiry into the state of racial issues, biases, and attitudes within and among the many communities and neighborhoods in the City of Philadelphia. Also, because the performance of its duties the Commission may cooperate with interested citizens and with public and private agencies,"" I ask that the Commission take testimony from individual citizens and from organizations including but not limited to community groups, non-profit organizations, law enforcement agencies, identifying the racial attitudes, Bob Huber are appropriate for rebuke by the Commission in light of the potentially inflammatory effect and the reckless endangerment to Philadelphia's racial relations possibly caused by the essay's unsubstantiated assertions. While I fully recognize that constitutional protections afforded the press are intended to protect the media from censorship by the government

1373170475.0,1hsbyo,NYC meets the City of Brotherly Love!,ThisisFKNBS,96,22,53,"My girlfriend and I visited Philadelphia over the Fourth of July weekend. We wanted to a little recap/review of the City of Brotherly Love!

**Food**
Sandwiches

We first went to **Tommy DiNic's** at Reading Terminal. Roast Pork with Spinach (they ran out of broccoli rabe). We were met with an insane line wrapped around the booth but luckily someone had gotten up from their seat and we were able to grab the seats. I thoroughly enjoyed it.  My girlfriend on the other hand found it to be not particularly exceptional. The roast pork was super moist and god I fell in love with the sharp provolone.

We also visited the **Amish Bakery** with all the doughnuts and wonderful looking pastries. We don't have much of a sweet tooth but the blueberry fritter caught our eye. She never had a fritter before and we both fell in love with the little glazed thing. We debated going back near the end of our trip just to get another one. On our way back we stopped by a 7-Eleven and she bought an apple fritter just to compare and.. yeah. The blueberry fritter was pretty awesome.

Continuing our journey for roast pork sandwiches

We wanted to avoid the tourist trap of cheesesteaks like Pat's and Geno's. I desperately wanted to go to John's Roast Pork but they were unfortunately on vacation which I'm not going to lie

This weekend was scorching hot and we wanted to cool down with some ice cream. We visited **Franklin Fountain**

The best dining experience was at a small quaint Italian restaurant called **L'Angolo**. The food was really good

**Activities**

We walked into **Magic Garden** which was an art gallery filled with boobs, glass, stained glass, glassware, art, pictures, and statues all meant to symbolize the artist's experiences. I wish we were able to spend more time here because it was so interesting and unique but the heat was getting to us. Would recommend!

We went to **Mutter Museum** as well. I wouldn't recommend going before lunch (which we ended up doing lol). The museum is filled with gruesome deformities and diseases of the human body. It was filled with bones, conjoined twins, crazy contraptions from medicinal history, and all sorts of oddities. It was creepy but interesting.

Our favorite part of the trip was driving to and exploring **Kelly Drive**. We passed the rows of flags of different countries and thought that was pretty cool. We got to the steps and proceeded to play Eye of the Tiger running up and claiming the steps like Rocky did. We sat around for awhile watching everyone else doing the same and enjoyed watching everyone else be silly just like us. The view of the city was captivating!

We did a little scavenger hunt by **Stray Boots**. We previously had done one in Boston and that was a lot of fun. The Philadelphia edition at Center City was a bit lackluster making us run around in circles for random things that never seemed to tie together.

A couple of notes that we really enjoyed about Philly were the random art murals all over the city which were beautiful and made the city unique.

The Love Fountain and the center with all the game pieces like dominoes

One thing I really loved about the city was how they embrace the gay community. We saw the rainbow colored street signs and found random [shirts](http://i.imgur.com/Wtwfxmj.jpg) and [signs](http://i.imgur.com/sog2AUV.jpg) supporting the gay community and thought that was great to see from a founding city of the United States.

Philly also seems to be a great biking city. I'm not sure how great SEPTA is but everything seems to be very commutable on bike and the city seems to do a great job supporting the biking community.
