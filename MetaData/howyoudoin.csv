They frequently had their differences (Phoebe not believing in evolution, just like in the theme song. Phoebe is the first one to console Ross after he finds out his wife is a lesbian. Phoebe is almost always the one pushing Ross to be with Rachel (masterminding the plan where Ross gets stood up and Rachel goes on a horrible date, convincing Ross to pursue things with Rachel in the hospital after Rachel gives birth to Emma, Phoebe drives Ross to the airport to meet Rachel etc).

1. Carol's character as a pregnant ex-wife makes her first on-screen appearance in episode 102, the topic of a same-sex couple raising a child is explicitly mentioned (during the Gellers' family dinner).  Friends was pretty pioneering.  

2. That said, the show seemed to make a big deal about Ross becoming a father.  But to be honest, it doesn't seem like he has that much responsibility... (except providing a male parent-figure, which if you think is important, actually negates a bit of the ""same-sex couples can raise children as well as straight couples"" argument.) 

3. What are the legal rights to Ben like?  First Carol, who would get him first, Ross or Susan?  In the ""Friends world,"" it would seem to be Susan, but legally, does Carol have the right to assign Susan a higher ""guardian rank"" than Ross?  It would seem that unless Carol can do something like that, legally it would go to Ross and Susan would get fucked.  

4. Do you guys think Ross pays alimony to Carol? 

5. What if Susan was a guy?  Relations between Ross and Carol would have been worse.  Do you think the Ross and Ben relationship would have been different in any way at all?

It's clear (he even says it) that he is afraid of them. And all they do is make fun of him. As a child I was really freaking scared of dogs and I'm still awared around them. So I can't understand why they don't accept it? Even hin own Wife doesn't stand by his side? Ugh..
Maybe someone has a good explaination on this one!?
