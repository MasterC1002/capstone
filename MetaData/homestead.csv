Of course our lifestyle change is incremental and I know I am preaching to the choir but tasting that icecream just put everything into perspective.

1325777454.0,o40vx,policies about sharing here on r/homestead,paulwheaton,178,28,103,"I wish to make it clear:  If you post lots of awesome homestead stuff here

I recently did a podcast with Geoff Lawton.  If Geoff Lawton cranked out two internet things a week and posted them here, and I am tickled pink that there is a way for me to learn a wee bit of it for FUCKING FREE!

The idea that Geoff Lawton should be banned from reddit because he is not posting crap from other people seems ridiculous to me.   Geoff Lawton does not have time for that.  He barely has time to put out the material he is already putting out.  Geoff is working on permaculture level 9 stuff - why should he hunt out and post stuff from permaculture level 2?  Or be forced to find some stupid picture of cats and post that?

I have to bring this up because I have now been officially banned from several subreddits for exactly this.  One mentioned that it is okay to post your own stuff provided that it is only 10% of what you post.  My stalker insists that you may never post your own stuff and follows me around downvoting and reporting all of my submissions.  And probably messaging the moderators of every subreddit I post to.

It is the right of the moderator of every subreddit to ban whoever they like - for any or no reason.  I respect that.  

I wish to make it clear that in this subreddit I will ban people for being icky, but I won't ban anybody for posting only their own stuff.  I want to see good content.  And I like the idea that the content generators are on reddit.  Perhaps a few subreddits  prefer to dissuade the content generators.

Please upvote this message so that everybody can see it.  Thanks!

Hey there good people of Reddit. This is my project

..

The Solarflower is an open source solar energy collector which tracks the sun automatically through a simple non-electrical mechanism.

It can be made almost anywhere from common recycled and salvaged materials using basic tools and skills, and can produce up to kilowatts of power per device.

Depending on available resources it should take one to three unskilled people less than a week to build

Potential examples of use could include:

~ Electrical production with simple steam turbine/piston

~ Dome oven with integrated water system for temperature regulation and hot/pasteurized water.

~ Steam distillation of water for removal of chemical

~ Medium to large scale food dehydration

~ Conversion of fibrous organic waste into charcoal for energy storage and low smoke cooking

~ And any other application utilizing heat.",self,t5_2s8lc,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/10fbm1/solarflower_an_open_source_scrap_makeable_solar/

In the northwest corner near the barn there's two pastured areas that have a gate between the two. The top left one is about 1.5 acres

The area inside the loop is a pond. Think it would be worth it to pasture that in to let livestock use that as a water source or should I just plan on a livestock waterer? I do have water spigots near the barn. 

On the topic of spigots, maybe that one would be less likely to freeze. I do have full electric out there so I could use a space heater on especially cold days. 

We thought we'd start with egg chickens and hopefully chickens for their meat at some point, etc in the freezer. 

I would also like to have a small beef herd at some point. The idea for that in my head at this point is to keep a few cows that I breed to raise the offspring for slaughter. Being that I'm looking at maybe 7 acres at the most

And of course we'll have a garden somewhere

Oh and it came with a tractor, at first I suspected the battery. It showed 12.2v while sitting but after a crank or two it drops to 6-7v. After sitting for a few minutes it shows 12.2v again. 

Once I get it running it still shows 12.2v so now I'm thinking alternator. I'm assuming a tractor alternator should run at 14 like a car? When I turned the headlights on the voltage at the battery dropped to 11.8.

In the organic nature of the thriving homestead-sustainable movement

But what about all those plastic bottles containing everything from water to detergent? It is difficult, and being realistic, there is not a viable return or recycling system. Sometimes they are safely reusable, but not so often.

That is why I began the project I describe here, we know that, which is why I began my project and why I submit it here for *informative, constructive* criticism.

THE PLASTIC FORGE

I melt plastic. The process is as simple as filling a vessel with oil (vegetable or petro)

Example: I do not have access to, and usually used as roundwood. Where I live (East Africa) we have termites. They are part of the ecology and we do not poison the numerous and extensive mounds. But living with them can be difficult and costly. When I build a permanent structure that rquires a post embedded in a foundation, I use concrete to protect the wood and for the superior long-term support. That is not practical for temporary structures; too difficult to move and reuse posts that have a huge chunk of heavy concrete on one end. So, I put plastic boots on the portion of these posts that will be in the ground; protects against termites and moisture. It is as easy as dipping the post into liquid plastic obtained by melting the above mentioned bottles, bags, packaging.

With experimentation

The process is akin to the ancient craft of blacksmithing. The forge is a cut down metal barrel with oil (recycled waste). Melting plastic floats on the hot oil and can be skimmed

Old tires can be smelted this way, but we collect scraps from locals who make their living making tire-sole sandals, which are daily wear here. Tires yield strong custom rubber. Plastic consumer containers - water, cola, shampoo, detergent bottles - melt at a lower temperature and are more pliable. (Takes a lot of them; tremendous reduction.) The ubiquitous supermarket plastic bags reduce to virtually nothing; takes hundreds to mold 1 square inch of solid plastic and are best (in my experience) tossed into the plastic bottle mix. Ditto the clear plastic ""window"" of packaging for batteries, electronics

You might imagine clouds of black

I do not propose this plasticsmithing as an answer to the waste problem created by consumer disposable plastics. It might be an option for getting viable re-use instead of dumping into the ever-growing mounds of plastic garbage. Whenever possible, several liters, and decant the contents into reused smaller, more handy bottles.

For example, we do not have municipal water and sometimes our water source is contaminated by runoff from heavy rain). I made rodent-proof, stackable kitchen canisters from these food-grade bottles. Cut the top off so that the bottom of the next bottle stacks snugly into the open bottle below it. Depth of each is determined by how far down from the bottle neck the top is removed. Last step, cut the bottom from the last bottle and snug it into the stack as a top lid.

Large water and soda bottles exposed to sunlight degrade into useless, they look like clay pots.)

Painted and filled with sand or gravel or water, and run a horizontal bar above the row. Toss the bottle string over the horizontal bar and tie it to the plant you might otherwise individually stake to keep it upright. As the plant grows, add weight to the bottle.

I am *not* advocating plastic. I am attempting to deal with them in a positive manner. I hope this helps some of you

But I *know* there are people out there who are really interested in learning about farming

Anyway, that don't understand the concepts of hard work and urgency.  And it seems that mostly girls are interested, too.  Which is fine, it's just that what my dad needs most is help with some of the grunt work that he's starting to get a little old for.  It's hard work, but it's not like it's work from the time you wake up until you go to sleep.

With the moderate isolation and all of us kids having moved out, especially if they're interested in farming.  A lot of the WWOOF farms in the US seem to be run by people that don't really know what they're doing, but my parents are very knowledgeable about most aspects of farming, at least in their climate.

Their farm is on WWOOF, and I'm not sure they'd be all that keen on having ""weirdos from reddit"" email them. (They're still a bit new to the Internet)  [Here is the link to their farm on WWOOF, for anyone that is a member and can see it.](http://wwoofusa.org/Profile?UserId=9b49e7fa-aca1-4b24-ad8f-2793bb504089)

We also already had two adult mixed breed ducks which no longer lay

We have spent the majority of this year talking to people, and figured that we had done as much prep as we possibly could, and it was time to actually do the deed.
We put the khakis we wanted to keep in an enclosure so they wouldn't see

My husband bopped the first one on the head to stun it; pupils dilated and fixed so it was stunned well

I am only little, so I am proud of myself for holding it together during this.
It was quite disconcerting seeing the neck gyrate around, and I have always strongly believed that I should be able to do this if I eat meat.

Since this bird was older, but breasted it out instead. It went well, though my husband had to pull some of the skin back as my fingers didn't have the strength to do it. I got the breast out, we cleaned up and started on the next one.

I started plucking and the world started going dark... I started to become unable to remove myself from the smell and still warm body and the knowledge that this duck was alive not 2 minutes ago. I told my husband that I was about to pass out

Unfortunately

Neither of us could do the third drake.

We spent the rest of the day feeling a bit off. The smell seemed to stay in our hands, that's where it comes from. I treated the birds well, and I believe they felt very little pain.

Is it normal to feel like this after your first slaughter? Does this mean I am incapable of doing it

How did you feel after your first slaughter?


**edit**

I just wanted to thank everyone for sharing their stories, and it was very delicious, and as fixesaxes said, it has completed the process for us and we actually feel better for it.

Having said that, but I am quite serious about my connection to things, and if I cannot be part of the whole process with a peaceful mind, I will not eat meat. I won't let someone else do what I cannot.

So thank you again for your points of view and your links and your encouragement. I really did take it all very seriously.

The women's line has lavender, lemongrass &amp; dandelion, sandalwood &amp; patchouli, rosemary mint, etc. We're working on a top secret hush-hush 3 ingredient simple soap and shampoo for people with allergies also!

Any ideas for the general name of the soap line would be greatly appreciated. ""Naughty nan's"", but you guys can do better! I've seen the memes you crazy kids have!

The main problem is that A LOT of the good names that I thought I was being so creative to think of have been taken 100's of times over.

Ideas for scents or good goat clip art (legal for profit use) would be great as well!

If someone can come up with a goat themed name that makes me smile and we go with it

Yesterday I buried six chickens in a mass grave.  They were ripped apart by a dog.  I raised them all from birth.  They all had names. 

Today

I moved away from a good job to pursue this ""sustainable"" life style.  And almost every day I am experiencing some type of kick to the face as described above. But

I read r/homestead for inspiration on days like today.  And I would love to hear your stories.  What drives you to forsake material goods
Is it because you've lost faith in consumerism/capitalism? You like being outdoors? You want to minimize your footprint? You want to be self-sufficient? You're worried about climate change/ peak oil and its effects on society?

I need some inspiration.

*EDIT 
Thank you all for the stories and support. I was in a funk when I posted and have definitely been inspired by what most of you had to say.  No homestead animals have died since writing this (though my dog did get hit by a car yesterday but he's recovering) so I think things are improving.  It took six chicken deaths (a total of 15 ducks and chickens over two weeks) for me to finally drop everything and just spend an hour in my fowl pen. It's something I need to do more often and something that is part of the essence of homesteading. Self reliance shows us the fragility of life. Which leads us to appreciate it more. Too often I get stuck lamenting a loss and not appreciating what I have.  Anyway,False,self,t5_2s8lc,1362298908.0,,,t3_19cv1y

I replied with this message to someone looking for chicken coop designs

I live in a residential neighborhood
I bought the wooden coop which has a roost and the roof flips open for easy cleaning. It also has a tray that catches their poop and slides out for cleaning. The entire front flips down into a ramp to enter and exit. The coop sits on an old wagon my kids use to play with. It makes the 4 legs of the coop sit about 2 inches off the ground. Then I built two 10 foot long PVC frames with bird netting zip tied on for their run. Since we live in a fenced backyard I've never been worried about critters attacking. Lastly I attached a 5 gallon bucket on the back of the coop as their nest box

This whole system is extremely portable, it is a 3 piece system. I do have two bungee cords attached to the first frame to the coop, but it's really not necessary, it just pulls the first frame when you move the coop, so you don't have to move 3 pieces separately.

I paid $100 for the wooden coop
Had this system for 6 months and works great! Couldn't be happier! Good luck!

As I said above, some alumi and other dissenting individuals brought the issue to VINE (veganism is the next era), an animal sanctuary. They offered to take on the oxen at no charge to the college, but we have stood by our decision to provide locally sourced, sustainably raised beef to the dining hall while at the same time avoiding using precious resources on animals that can no longer work (and one that is in incredible pain, unable to walk more than fifty feet at once).

When VINE heard that we wouldn't take up their offer, how we will never get a job with Green Mountain College on our resumes, et cetera. Professors are receiving hate mail. The students are attempting to reason with people, but they are so slanderous and disrespectful that it is difficult. People internationally and others from all over the US have been decrying our decision, the Huffington Post ran an article titled ""Green mountain College's Faux Environmentalism,"" and we really need some help on the offensive.

I've come here to hopefully get the word out to people who are interested. I want to make sure I'm not presenting myself as a person who thinks veganism is in some way wrong

Here are some additional details on the proprty if it'll help in the 'assessment"".

Although it's 7.5 acres

Of the remaining 3.3 acres, a good sized garden and greenhouse, and a few fruit trees (cherry/apple).  The rest is treed and slopes up in a northerly direction (so the entire slope face is south-facing, and would get a good amount of sunshine if cleared and if I put in a terraced garden of some sort).  The climate in the area is fairly mild, with 160 frost-free days per year, an average low for the year of 2.7 C (36.9 F) with the lowest average being -6.4 C (20.5 F) in January, and an average high for the year of 9.9 C (49.8 F) with the highest average being 21.3 C (70.3 F) in July.  Average yearly precip is 52 inches

I'm a long-time lurker on this subreddit and have always enjoyed the inspiration and information provided. I'm using a throwaway account to hide these plans from my current employers and family

My wife and I are in our early 30s and have 2 daughters younger than 4 yr old. We currently own a small home and have conventional city/tech jobs in the southwest US. For the second half of our 20s we've been striving to be 100% free from debt

For the past 5 years or so we've been growing vegetables and herbs. It started as a small garden(30s.ft) with tomatoes, kale and swiss chard, and grew into ~200s.ft of garden with variety of veg. Because of our hot and sunny climate we can basically grow year round, but it's super dry and required a ton of irrigation. For the past couple years we've had nothing but bountiful harvests and have loved the experience of growing most of our own food.

Along the way we learned the basics: composting, perserving, etc. All from our 1/5 acre backyard. It's been wonderful. But cramped. It's time to upgrade to the next level.

Since we got out of debt and have felt more freedom in general, and a cow. We're not looking to create a business of farming, instead just a lifestyle that can provide most of what we need - food, clothes, the basics. Anything we produce in surplus would be shared with those who need it. 

Here's our main dilemma

We've looked all over the country and the NE region seems to be the ideal location. Best prices, they're still way outside of our range. We'd need to save for many years before we'd even have a chance at being able to afford a small 5-10 acre plot with an old farmhouse. 

Our home in the SW won't be selling any time soon

With our current incomes we'd have a chance of qualifying for a second home loan

How do small families with modest incomes unplug from the city life? It seems like the cards are stacked against us. We can wait till our 40s and our kids are half-grown

To put it simply, that seems to be the expectation. More worryingly, to get a 'good job' the chances are I'd have to live in London, an idea that I cannot express in words how much I'd hate. I cannot stand cities, least of all London. I hate my home town which is pretty small, we live in the suburbs of it.

They can all go off and chase money among the crowds and noise and traffic

So, and you have to look hard to find bits of countryside that could be called beautiful in which you could live. The kind of places I like are colder climates with pine forests and plenty of space. I'm thinking somewhere like Canada or Scandinavia. 

This won't go down too well here, I'm not that sort of person. For the last year, I've been learning to become a blacksmith as a hobby, I'm decent enough at it now, producing some good knives and axes. My decorative stuff isn't great, but I understand the fundamentals and definitely have enough to become an apprentice with. I'm also good with electronics and electrics as well as woodwork. I tend to learn practical skills quite quickly.

I think the best way to do this is to say what I want, but perhaps you could tell me how to get there. I see myself in a reasonably sized log cabin built myself, working as a blacksmith, land bought and paid for and money enough to buy a decent bit of food. I like my luxuries, I'd want a fire, running water, power and internet which may be difficult/expensive. But I'm a bit of a PC enthusiast, so I'd like to be able to peruse that and stay in touch with the rest of the world. I'd like to have my own decent bit of woods

The problems I see are the obvious issues of logistics. A place to stay while I'm building, things like sewage and power. Obviously I'd need to do a decent amount of work which I expect, but I'm not sure if I could live with some of the things I've read on here which sounds something between a toilet and a compost heap!

I'd better stop here! I hope you don't mind pointing me in the right direction here as in a lot of ways, fishing and walking all the time, and it was virtually all I cared about. But school and work are pulling me away from this outdoor lifestyle, as well as the rapid development of my once rural area, and I'd like to claim it back! Simple life, work I love without being completely isolated technologically- that's what I'm after!

1356274586.0,15bsfc,Balancing homestead wants with typical American house design.,Amator,46,11,43,"My wife and I live in a horrible crowded subdivision where we can't have a garden without neighborhood kids pulling up the plants

My in-laws visited yesterday and told us that my wife's grandparents were giving my in-laws their inheritance now as the taxes will go up significantly after 2012. As part of this, and build. We're looking at between US$250,000 and $300,000 total. 

Here's the rub: My wife is 95% on board with living a homesteading life. She wants goats, etc. but she also wants a nice traditional house and standard contemporary luxuries such as a big energy-inefficient fridge, a house bigger than we need, etc. My in-laws are neocons who live in a McMansion and want us to do the same. If I had my way I'd build an earth-sheltered house, strawbale, cob, etc. and be completely off grid. 

I'm trying to find the right balance to approach in this matter so that we can build something resilient that will also satisfy my wife and in-laws. I'd prefer to spend a large chunk of the budget on the land and build a small house we can eventually add onto, and at least 10 acres. 

We're located in NW South Carolina USA. I'm 34

My questions:


1. Does anyone have any suggestions on places we can find good plans? I love the houses at CountryPlans.com but they're too small for the 4bedroom, etc. instead of standard plan sites that assume you have HVAC on 24/7.

2. What homesteading house features are very important to add when the house is first built and which can be added easily later? I'm sure we'll have a HVAC

3. What's the minimum amount of land I should settle for? I want enough so that we can eventually sell a few acres to my brother or another close friend so they can be neighbors and enough for a small pastured livestock operation and Permaculture garden. I'm thinking 15 acres is my minimum and while I'd love 100 acres it's out of our price range.

I have many plans for the land that include fruit trees &amp; bushes, and paddocks for chickens and ducks. My business plan involves selling my products at farmers' markets and to local food distributors. Once I have these systems in place I'd like to work the agrotourism and education angles by hosting school field trips and teaching/hosting community education on topics relating to gardening

In the meantime, but I don't feel like I have as much time as I'd like to implement them. I find myself sitting in a cubicle at work wishing I could be outside on my land. Some days it makes me pretty miserable, other days I take comfort in the stability of having a constant paycheck and aggressively paying down my mortgage. 

My question is this: at what point should I quit my job and start homesteading/market gardening full time? I wish I could do it tomorrow

On the most conservative end of the spectrum, and have a substantial amount of savings. This would allow me to be a full time homesteader in my mid 30s. 

On the more risky end of the spectrum I could save up enough money to float my mortgage for 2 years, but I'd be taking a bigger risk than I'm typically comfortable with. 

Somewhere in between these extremes would be the idea of building the food systems and a house while I'm still employed and switching over once I have adequete saving to float any remaining debt for a few years. This is the track I'm currently on

The outhouse was a staple on the homestead since man began to poop. It has only recently gone out of fashion and mostly because of government regulations. Don’t get me started on ‘regulations’ or I’ll be flinging poo for hours. There are ways around them. 

I grew up in Iowa over half a century ago and most farms back then didn't have running water to the house. A windmill pump at the livestock tank was it. Outhouses were a necessity and were everywhere. 

I currently own two homes and both are equipped with an outhouse. I don’t normally use the outhouse for poopin but it is there when needed

If you can find an outhouse that someone doesn't want

To keep the County property inspector at bay I cover the seats with a piece of plywood and use my outhouse for garden tool storage. It keeps my tools dry and my mind at ease knowing it is there if needed

If you really need modern conveniences run electric to the outhouse

Try to set your outhouse where it will have a great view but not be too far from the house. It gets cold running to the outhouse at night during a blizzard in your robe. Always set your outhouse up so the door faces away from the prevailing winter winds, so what’s the problem? 

Decorate your outhouse and make it comfortable. I put in real toilet seats for comfort (I’m old). Every year I get a new outhouse calendar and I have covered the walls with outhouse calendars from years gone past. Hang an old chalk board or new white board on the wall for outhouse graffiti (chalk will still work at -40F). Outhouse humor is the best. A nice paint job tied to a theme will really spiff it up. If you have the skills and tools

For the smell (what smell?) throw some wood ash from the stove down the hole to keep the stank down. Hang your toilet paper somewhere where the mice won't get it or they will. A urinal for the guys is a  nice addition to keep the seat clean. Hang a LARGE funnel (some guys have very bad aim) on the wall with a hose running to a hole under the seat to drain. 

Some complain that they are afraid a spider might bite them while seated on the throne. Believe me

Now it’s time to have some fun. I know a lot of you have a treasure trove of outhouse stories, the more shitty the puns the more upvotes. 

TL:DR this article contains more crap than a politician.

I'm pretty ready to stop relying on the system and start taking care of myself. I'm going to start putting money aside for my farm right away. 

My dream farm is in the Texas Hill Country. I want Dairy goats (or maybe even sheep) , and enough food in my garden to support myself and whoever else wants to come build a house on our land. My husband wants to build the house himself. There will be solar panels on the roof, a well, and a rainwater collection system.  By then I want to be able to make all of our clothes. Preferably I would have over 12 acres but 6 should do it if I'm short on funds. We would like to be close enough to a national park that we could rent out log cabins.

My wife and I offered to purchase the lots from them, agree to lease the land to us for next to nothing (enough to pay the property taxes which I believe are $200/ year total) provided we use the land to farm.  

At the moment, eventually have a chicken coop, and (if possible) plant two rows of hop rhizomes. Of course, we're also toying with a nut tree or two (black walnut? Hazelnut?). 

We already produce more food than the two of us can consume with our current set-up until we upgrade our freezer and basement storage.  Our primary motivation is to ""farm"" on a micro-scale largely just for the experience and sell the produce to our existing contacts within the slow-food/ farmers' markets around town (we've a lot of experience with markets and growers and we've already had offers to purchase some of our harvest this year).   

A few other bits: 
-We're in zone 5b
-we keep bees
- the area isn't fenced

My girl and I have been away from home for a week. While we were gone

We put on the snowshoes that I borrowed from a buddy (captain foresight beats captain hindsight any day) and broke trail the remaining 1/8 mile uphill to the house. It was 2°F

When we got to the front door

Not about to break a window

We threw down our gear. At around 11 she passed out in bed from exhaustion. I stayed awake until 12:30 ruminating the thoughts of the tasks that lay ahead of me the next morning. Fix the lock or break the door. Clear all 1/4 mile of my driveway. Somehow rescue my Jeep from 3 feet of hardpack snow.

I awoke the next morning and got down to business. I disassembled the the lock and brute forced the deadbolt open. I put it together and paused to have a cup of coffee. Next

Now for the big one. Time to rescue the Jeep. I started by snowblowing a wedge shaped area behind the Jeep that would let me ease it back on to the driveway. Almost got the tractor stuck twice doing that! I tried backing it out. A lot of rocking

I dug a 2 foot wide perimeter around the jeep. The top foot and a half of it was snow, crossed my fingers, locked the differential, and threw her in reverse.

Popped right back onto the driveway like there wasn't even any snow on the ground. (must have been because I removed it all)

I whistled ""[still alive](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RthZgszykLs#t=0m55s)"" while I threw the shovel in the back of the Jeep and drove to the house. This was a triumph. I'm making a note here

I should probably get to the point

Has everything I've done in the past 24 hours improved the taste? You bet your ass it did.

Just a little story I thought some of you would find interesting.  Hopefully you can learn from my mistakes!

TLDR: I got my Jeep stuck and we had to snowshoe up to my house last night. My girl rolled her ankle and vommed. I spent the better part of today fixing my front door

For you potential homesteaders, and when things go wrong.  Normally, my neighbor could have chained my Jeep to his truck and pulled me out no problem.  Thing is, he went rabbit hunting all weekend.  I guess what I'm saying is, if you want this kind of lifestyle, be ready to have life throw you a whole new set of curveballs.  ",,self,,

2. Is it possible for 3 goats to graze in a single acre for 90% of their diet

3. I have heard about various parasites that goats are vulnerable to

5. I have read that a special Cream Separator to make butter from goat milk. Is it even worth it? Where would one go to purchase or how would one construct one of these devices?

I'm a 21 year old college graduate who will be moving to a rural village in St. Lawrence County

I'll be working as a farmer 6 days a week

If there's anything you think I should know please let me know

Some specific questions I have are:

1. Work clothes, weeding, packing, farm repair, irrigating, and working with the tractors. I was planning on going to a goodwill/salvation army store to pick up some clothes for work that I won't have to worry about ruining. I know to get jeans and t-shirts. I was wondering if there was anything else I should buy--a field bib? work gloves? water resistant clothes? Where can I get these clothes? I saw Cabelas had some good prices on their website.

2. Food--My employer is supposed to supply a trip once a week into town to get supplies, I can't wait for smoked fish on the weekends!

3. Meeting the people of the town--I've heard that I may be seen as an outsider, it's not healthy for the mind. What would be some good ways to meet people outside of the job? I'd imagine that I could head to the bars or any festivals, but should I stand back at first and observe until people warm up to me? Could I take the initiative to meet people rather than having people come to me?

The obvious reason that alpacas are selling so high is that supply can't keep up with demand.

The advanteges to keep an alpaca over a llama are as follows; the animal doesn't spit at you and the fiber can be sold for huge amounts of money.

Well let's say over the next 10 years supply catches up to demand. We all know this will eventually happen as boer goats used to sell for over $100

If alpacas dropped to $500 each I'm asuming the fiber would end up dropping in price as this price would make a commercial fiber operation viable.

[(Original post)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/jinm3/my_new_composting_setup_includes_human_waste/)

My outdoor [toilet](http://i.imgur.com/71Ncf.jpg) consists of a hand made table fitted with a toilet seat with a 20(ish) gallon muck bucket underneath.   

Poo/kitchen scraps go into the bucket and then get covered with a handful or two of sawdust or pine shavings.   (Before you ask

Today I built a new proper compost bin out of 4 used pallets and some vinyl twine and I thought I'd share the process with you guys.

Stage 2: Prepare the initial Ingredients  
[Bucket of poo / used Mouse cage bedding](http://i.imgur.com/xFeJK.jpg)

[Couple pitch fork loads into the bin](http://i.imgur.com/FXT4i.jpg)   
[In goes the poo bucket](http://i.imgur.com/dPwKF.jpg)  
The initial ""whiff"" of air here was a bit pungent.   I looked and could not identify any actual poop.   Mostly I just see wet shavings and some paper products I tossed in there recently.      
[Spent 20 minutes weeding my garden/yard and threw that in as a cover material](http://i.imgur.com/YBswa.jpg)     

I'll be adding a couple tubs worth of mice bedding later today and probably some more weeds.  
 
This bin will be on a 3 year cycle.  3 years must pass after adding the last bucket containing human waste.  I'll continue to add yard waste until it's full and as it shrinks.   According to my book the final product will be ~20% of the original mass/volume.   Should take me about a year or two to fill it up.   That bucket contained about 2 months worth of poo and bin is only filled up about 10-15%.  (figure 2-3% once it's composted)  It looks about half full but those weeds/straw will shrink and compact very quickly.   

My timeline/recipes are based off of the [Humanure Handbook](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;cp=9&amp;gs_id=12&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=humanure+handbook&amp;qe=aHVtYW51cmUg&amp;qesig=tRyxY7xElmdFbepqAGhWJw&amp;pkc=AFgZ2tnMrSvStpPSAuOO3iTZYuKWNCRLcXP-W_7Dar0PsLTTrWspXg1Qa0uMvcLkPIrX0AsKamYYBfX6XAd8R8GK37R7BpxoTg&amp;pf=p&amp;sclient=psy&amp;safe=off&amp;site=&amp;source=hp&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=humanure+&amp;aq=0&amp;aqi=g5&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=&amp;gs_upl=&amp;bav=on.2

A little while ago I came across this website: http://www.simplesolarhomesteading.com. More specifically, pays under $200 for property taxes, and under $200 for heating each year. He built the house itself for $2000, and the solar system cost about $3000. His house runs on battery power at night, which is enough for a TV and a laptop as well as all the lights and whatever else he has.

This appeals hugely to me because I want my own place and I don't care too much about the size of it. It seems like I could live on very little money as well

I realized if I built a house like simplesolar's it would probably cost more. I would want a septic tank instead of a composting toilet, so I would probably take the time to do mine properly.

There are some problems I see, and for a lot of nerdy internet things, which leads me into my next point.

I live with a decently reliable and fast internet connection. I saw the other thread about internet in rural areas

Another potential problem with building a house similar to simplesolar's would be heating and cooling. I don't know if a window air conditioner would be too much for the electric system

Anyway, cost of living, and finding a good location? Are there any books I can pick up on this subject?

None of the shareholders (except possibly my mother) are interested in moving to the property or taking a more direct role in its management. 

I currently lack the expertise to take over farm operations. And I don't have enough capital to do much in the way of renovation or repair

My background is a combination of programming and education. In the area are several schools in need of teachers so several opportunities for employment there. Programming, though I have little experience with that and would prefer a steadier income to begin with. Ideally I'd like to be able to buy the farm from my cousins and uncle once I have enough money. At least my cousins, reduce the split to three people with one in near majority control (I'd own a 50% stake at that point). I'm uncertain of the land's value at this time, but the regional average is $1400/acre so about $112k for their stakes.

So my questions:

1) Any experience with taking over a family owned property like this that has gotten split up through the generations? Have you found people generally accomodating or ...?

2) Any opinion on the income plan? Does teaching leave a single person enough time to develop and maintain a property like this? I particularly like this idea with the summers off to spend on property improvements. Income wise

3) Build or renovate? The house is well over 100 years old at this point. It spent the 90s in a pitiable state of disrepair. To my knowledge, roof and siding in a bad way. I have not been inside recently as I'm not the property owner and there have been renters every time I've visited.

A few months ago

[Here’s the results](http://imgur.com/a/ZM4sc). It turns out I have 3/4"" PVC and it's 160 feet from the rain barrel site to the garden. After much agonizing over the best and easiest means of testing the efficiency of water columns at various heights, let’s build it and see what happens.” I had initially planned to have the barrels side by side and draining from the very bottom but their tops aren’t removable and so I had no way of getting inside to put together a flange. After some internet hunting I found a means of filling and draining that didn’t require cutting them at all. (Though I later opted to cut a fill hole in the very top. It was just simpler and more efficient) The stand is almost an exact copy of one I found [here](http://www.digthedirt.com/contributions/1961-Stacked-rain-barrels), though I did beef up the bracing and used 3/8”x4” lag screws to hold everything together. It’s a veritable brick outhouse and could easily hold a 3rd barrel if I needed it to. It’s quite a bit taller than I had anticipated, with a filled waterline a few inches over 6 feet. 

Once I had it completed, it turns out I needn’t have worried about the pressure. It’s well more than enough to give me great flow. Enough to drain one 55 gallon barrel in about 15-20 minutes. You can see from the pictures that I only have one bed set up with the PVC drip system while the rest is still the vinyl stuff. I’ll gradually replace each bed with PVC as money and time allow and those will almost certainly decrease the pressure and flow I have now but since I have more than I need, I think it will be alright. The next step will be to build a system to divert overflow as a good solid rain filled both barrels in about 10 minutes. 

For those interested

Thanks again to everyone that helped and I hope my experience may have helped or inspired someone else here. I’m open to all comments and criticisms of the rain barrel system

1353863060.0,13rj8v,Hoping for some discussion regarding our upcoming move.,pickleeater,31,3,43,"My husband and I have been living aboard boats for the past six years

We're in the process of selling the boat. We started a business five years ago, so we're trying to find some sort of middle-ground to call home.

There are a lot of things we're trying to sort out. Do we buy land and build? Is it absolutely essential that we get a well? Septic? Electric? I don't care if we have to use an outhouse for the next 20+ years

My husband is extremely handy. He's been doing boat projects non-stop for the past six years and will definitely feel the need to be working on a project at all times. How much would it cost to build a simple

We have one kid and might have one or two more in the near future

Land is fairly cheap - we can find it for about $1k/acre. How much land do we buy? We dream of gardens, but we're looking mostly at properties that back up to state land. We'll want to heat with wood, unless my sinuses *still* can't handle it (they never could while living at my parents).

We've been finding a lot of great deals on cabins. What should we really focus on if we end up buying something already built? We both know exactly what to look for in a boat

Lastly - our budget is going to be pretty tight. We have a few thousand saved up

Our current plan is to live with family while we make these decisions - at least 6 months but it could end up being longer.

Anyway, and teach my daughter about living in the woods. 

Thanks

tl;dr: my husband and I want to buy property

My questions is this: What sort of machine should I rent to free up these trees and get on top of the brush?  Should I just leave this to the professionals and contract it out? Any idea on costs?

My super-new husband and I are getting a house this spring. It's a 3 bed, but I definitely want to get the ball rolling.  We're not looking to be totally self-sufficient (yet), but we'd like to build up in that direction. 

Things I am interested in tackling: 

* chickens (egg and meat)

* goats (milk products and meat)

* bees (plant pollination and honey)

* garden (food and seeds; there are lots of gophers there and

* fruit trees (food)

* canning/preserving

* worm composting


Now

* Where do I go for design plan ideas for the property? Looking for things like pens/pastures, bee/tree/garden locations, and stuff of that ilk. 

* How do I got about building pens and pasture for the goats?

* How do I deal with the sloping land? I was thinking of planting grass there and designing two large pens

* There is a small amount of actual flat space where I was planning on putting the garden. I want raised beds to protect against the darn gophers, how can I make sure there is enough drainage? How do I find out how many beds I need? And do berries (blueberries and raspberries) do well in beds?

* Can I plant an mini-orchard on a slope? How do I protect them from deer? 

* Where/how can I find a butcher who could help me or teach me how to process the goats (and in the future, taxidermy, and organ removal, but I am at a bit of a loss on how to go about culling and preparing different cuts of meat (hopefully with as little skeletal damage as possible, because bones are cool o.O)

* We will be having children in the not-so-distant future. Is what I am planning so far a little too much work for me to do pretty much by myself while I am raising babies and husband is at work? I know woman have done this for many millennia

* Is there anything I am blatantly overlooking?",self,t5_2s8lc,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/14ot55/finally_getting_our_house_now_where_to_start/

2. How far do most consider acceptable from a smaller city or even regional airport?  Under 2hrs max for airport and 1-1.45hrs for the next major city?

I've had chickens for a little while now and two of them seem to be sick or something.  Maybe you guys have some advice for me.

Their crops are really big and don't seem to go down in the morning.  They keep doing this weird thing with their necks/heads like they are trying to hold down vomit.  A few times I've seen them have liquid coming out of their mouths.  I've done some research and I think this might be sour crop so I gave them yogurt and mixed in some olive oil with their food.  I massaged their crops every day to try to get the food moving along.  One of them seemed to be better the last few days but this morning she was doing the weird neck movements again.  Does this sound like sour crop?  What should I do?

The back of the barn leads into the one of the pastures. I was thinking of making a pen at the back of the barn to provide shelter for the sheep. Here's some pics of the back

I was thinking of running fencing board or just basic 1x6s from lowes on the outside and a [livestock gate](http://i.imgur.com/53bCG.jpg) in the middle. Here's a [non scale drawing](http://i.imgur.com/53bCG.jpg) of what I was thinking. Red = exterior walls, blue = livestock gate with arrow for turn direction. I also considered using a 2nd livestock gate so that I could turn my single pen into 2 if I wanted and have the middle open to access the pasture. 

Those measured gaps shown are from the inside edge of each post. This already presents a problem as the gates I'm seeing are 8' or 10'. It shouldn't be a problem to get the 10' to work in the 9'11"" section. Maybe for the 9'3"" attach a shorter 6x6 to each 6x6? That would leave me with a 8'3"" gap

For the fence board

Another issue is that 12' sliding door. That would be their way in/out for the moment. In the summer I could leave it open and get some nice circulation

What about cutting a square out of the siding and making a smaller hinged door? I could even reattach the siding to the outside of the door.

My husband and I are looking at a farm that is for sale through owner financing in Montana. It is a really good deal, which isn't an issue, we can do that. However, the land was originally owned by a man that abused the right of way his neighbor had given him to this landlocked farm. The owner was arrested, his house foreclosed on and since 2009 has been bounced from one company to another. We spoke to the neighbor today and he made it clear that he would not give right of way access to us if we bought the property and told us if we tried to force the issue he would fight it. 

I don't blame the neighbor, I really want this property, but as I have spent the last few hours reading, I can try to force him to allow us under Montana common law. We'd have to pay him the fair market value of that section of land but we'd get our easement. However it can go either way it seems.

The front runner for When We Win The Lottery is a papercrete dogtrot with rainwater collection, and possibly solar electric (altho The Spouse likes to wind me up by talking about living without electricity at all). 

I'm an architect and have always loved old houses. When I was a teenager my parents bought an old house and moved it to some acreage

Thanks in advance for your help and advice!",self,t5_2s8lc,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/vr6rp/moving_a_house_anybody_done_it_recently/

1337820436.0,u1y1x,My duckling is hurt! Advice?,,22,3,14,"Hello! This is my first post here
I have 6 one-month old Muscovy ducklings that kind of roam the yard freely with their mother and another duck. One of them has a huge hole in his thigh and something looks to be almost bulging out of it. I think a raven got him
Now, because he'll push against your hand. He's really alert and has an appetite. We caught him and put him in a large bin with some hay and a heat lamp and he's doing alright. 
I just don't know what to do about that leg. Any advice? Should I clean it? Wrap it? Leave it? 
Obviously I would try a veterinarian

TL;DR Muscovy duckling

Any advice would be appreciated!

One began scouring immediately and died within a few days. We treated them all with Terramyacin. The rest were doing fine, etc. The only ""symptom"" any of them are showing would be runny eyes and occasionally milky snot in nostrils. We took them off of the antibiotic two days ago. This morning
