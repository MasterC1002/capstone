I got an unpaid summer internship with a consolidated city-county planning organization in my hometown. Most of my work is mind-numbing. Take these 50 pages of this 500 page Comprehensive Plan (mind you, then double-check it again. Spreadsheets and Outlook and a fucking gray cubicle in a gray office in dead silence okay I'll stop now.

Now, and this is my first job. I do the shit that nobody else wants to do in exchange for a bullet point on the resume, course credit, and an inside look at how a planning agency functions. I get that. I understand that planning can and will get a little mundane. Mix in zoning codes, bureaucratic red tape, etc....I'm sure y'all know what I'm talking about. My supervisor takes me to meetings, for example, and so is my work at this instant. I accept these facts due to the nature of my internship and the nature of planning and am not complaining about that.

**What concerns me, but *nothing* near the truth. The smartest minds in the region, collaborating around a map and a whiteboard, brainstorming how to save Detroit. Ideas flow freely; people innovate, create, inspire. They forge something beautiful out of something mediocre. And that's all Disneyland bullshit.

What I do see is people shuffling around doing paperwork about, synthesizing, and revising whatever arbitrary documents there are, instead of.....planning. You know, the exciting stuff that keeps me awake in class. I still read up on planning, devour subject material with intensity, and vigorously debate light rail with whoever dares to try me. The passion is still there. I just enjoy spending time in the GIS room more than in my planning cubicle.

So far in the professional world

Congrats if you made it this far. Now, or deliver the plan ol' ugly truth, I would really appreciate it.

A couple of days ago, but the article did make a few valid points. Office space is prohibitively expensive in downtown Washington DC, among the highest in the country. Skyscrapers would help alleviate this by ~~lowering demand~~ increasing supply, and thusly, lowering office space prices. On the other hand, some people argue that Washington DC is one of the more evenly developed cities and that height restrictions push development out of the urban core and into the surrounding communities that may have otherwise languished without demand.

Another topic is infrastructure. Los Angeles has had height and density limits for the longest time in an effort to not overwhelm the cities infrastructure. This has

Lastly, Vancouver, and until recently, Philadelphia, have had height restrictions in place to preserve a natural beauty or important historic architecture. Is there a way to balance high-rise development without compromising historic values?

I hope you guys enjoy the conversation

It's seems to me that usually you start with a little rougher neighborhood, lower income; then it slowly transitions to a hip neighborhood, more bars and restaurants, younger demographic overall with more money than their predecessors but not a whole lot more; finally you end up with the newer development that the younger people and students can't afford.

It's a serious question and not meant to be snarky or anything--would it be fair to say that the people getting priced out of their neighborhood by the ""young urban professional"" crowd share some of the responsibility for the gentrification? I'd like to flesh out this idea a bit so please comment if you agree or disagree

**Concentrations** - Are there certain specializations that are more marketable and in-demand? Likewise

**Schools** - I've seen the list of the top 10 programs, does anyone have input about UW-Madison's program? The location is pretty appealing to me.

**Employment** - Does a willingness to relocate anywhere in the US significantly increase employment prospects

**Admissions** - Again, but I totally bombed the writing with a 3.5 score (30th%). Should I be worried?

I would especially appreciate any advice from those of you who have ever been in a position to hire a young planner.

1. The general theme I've gathered from previous threads is to get a master's degree in planning. Check. I've done that. I went to a PAB-accredited planning program and have a 3.98 GPA. I also had a planning internship and served in the Peace Corps in a planning capacity. I've even been invited by one of my professors to write a chapter in the second edition of a book she's editing. So what am I doing wrong? For those who have been in a position to hire: what are you looking for? (The HR departments of places I've applied to tell me that I am eligible for interview consideration

2. (This one is geared to American planners.) Apart from education, but I can't get certified without first getting hired. Do any of you have tips on qualifying for AICP while just shy of the experience?

3. What I've been told from others (in planning and elsewhere), requiring membership, or in come cases, conferences. Where else can I go to meet planners? With this in mind, my latest approach has been marketing. I made a resume/portfolio website and business cards, but where do I go about sharing the goods?

Thanks in advance for any advice you might be able to bestow upon me.

**TL;DR: I Can't land an interview, who do I give my networking cards to?**

**Update:** Just got a call from a potential employer who likes what I have to offer. The source of that contact was through my graduate program's alumni network.

I graduated with my Masters in City and Metropolitan Planning last year after an (unpaid) internship in planning and several other internships before that.  I was struggling to find work after I graduated for almost a year until last May.  The job I got is with a government agency in my state

I apply and apply to job after job and continue to be rejected.  So-called ""entry-level"" jobs ask for years of experience I do not have which is vexing.  I believe my internships should at least count as some experience though.  I have tried contacting my local American Planning Association chapter to try and volunteer so I could build a network.  It ended up being a bit disorganized though when I tried to help and so I am pretty sure this is a dead end too.

The state I live in is conservative with a large majority being one religious culture that I am not

Is there any advice you can provide on how to keep up my skills and possibly finally get work in the field?

Cleveland State University is currently my dream school with Rutgers University very close behind.

In no particular order


*  University at Albany
*  University at Buffalo
*  Michigan State University
*  Wayne State University
*  University of Michigan
*  University of Cincinnati
*  University of Wisconsin-Madison
*  University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee
*  University of Minnesota-Twin Cities
*  Cleveland State University
*  Rutgers University



SUNY would be the cheapest as I'm a state resident. All these schools offer various specializations that I'm interested in with CSU and Rutgers offering them all.

I want to specialize in all (yes all)


*  Community Development
*  Economic Development
*  Historical Preservation
*  Housing (mostly centered on public housing)
*  Urban regeneration
*  Transportation (mass transit/public transit)

My goal (and my thesis) is the revival of Buffalo

1285005998.0,dggmp,Just finished my Masters in Planning and am looking for my first job. Any suggestions Reddit?,ender6,16,2,11,"So I finished my Masters in Urban Planning just before the summer

I guess what I'm wondering is if anyone could suggest good resources that list jobs in urban planning or, I remain open to just about any position or role that I would find compelling, while allowing me to gain a foothold in the industry and gain that valuable 'first-job' experience that I know I need. 

I currently live in Toronto, my focus was on urban design, implementing renewable energy and using media as part of the planning process. While I would be very comfortable continuing along these lines, I am also very open to diving into other aspect of the planning field.

Any suggestions are welcome
