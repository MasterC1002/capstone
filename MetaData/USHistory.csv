As I understand, the US were build by immigrants and in the early XIX west territories were rather uninhabited. And probably people from east were going west to find a good place for living. And here are my questions:

* It's not easy to create a village. Of course you can construct your house
* The place were they founded a new town
* How did they partition land? If people joined later
* Did they pay taxes? How did the goverment know about a new city and how does it collect taxes?
* How other people from outside knew about new cities

I hope this is the right place to ask this. If it's not

I'm taking a US history course in college right now and history isn't my best subject. I'm more of a math and science person

However I've been watching a lot of Doctor Who and have been wrapping my brain around time travel and how you shouldn't change anything if you can help it, things I've thought about include: **if the South had won the civil war (or for that matter if the civil war hadn't even happened at all); if WWI didn't happen, would the Great Depression have occurred? And if it hadn't, would the US have become the world leader that it is today?** I feel like the push for trade after the Great Depression and certainly post-WWII trade helped push us into US hegemony.

&gt;“It is clear in both the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution that the founding fathers shifted away from the idea of the United States as a collective of sovereign countries to the idea of one country comprised of many individual identities. In comparing and analyzing the two documents

My first point is that under the AoC, the united States, in Congress assembled (no typo on united). This was just a body of delegates from each of the states, and was the only governing body of the newly formed ""perpetual union"".  When they rewrote the Constitution, they created the Executive branch as we know it now (a President, VP, other officials etc; Congress = senate + house). That difference is indicative that the individual state governments weren't enough to keep things okay. And hopefully I can explain that point better in the actual paper

My second point is what I wanted to ask about: I wanted to talk about the contrast in judicial systems before and after the Constitution. From what I've been able to glean from the AoC, making state court the highest court. With the Constitution came the Supreme court, making it the highest court in the land.

I was hoping I could enlist your help and we could come up with a list (complete with links) that covered the gamut of American History. 

As people add things I will post them here in chronological order. At the least

Please leave the following-


**Subject Matter- Movie Name [](link) ** Then you can talk about it or let us know if it's a documentary or otherwise. If it's not a documentary let us know how historically accurate it is. 

(*PS- Where I am I don't have access to IMDB so sorry I didn't follow my own directions. I'm coming back to add more later


**MOVIES**

**The French and Indian War- The Last of the Mohicans**[From Wikipedia]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_the_Mohicans_%281992_film%29) This is a dramatization of the story of an adopted Mohican Indian during the French and Indian War. It’s a great movie but only gives information about the war incidentally to advance the plotline.

I'm working this summer on an archaeological (more of a combination of oral history, NY. This historic Native and African American community has been struggling against discrimination since its establishment around 200 years ago and they now face an even greater threat in the gentrification that has degraded the community in recent years (They've gone from 40 local families around 50 years ago to a mere 14 today).

I've gotten to know some of the residents and they are wonderful people

The Higher Ground Inter-Cultural &amp; Heritage Association, even achieving their goal of creating the historic district (the only one in NY state designated as such for its cultural rather than architectural value). But to do much more they need funds.

So they entered and became a finalist in this National Trust competition. But they're having trouble spreading the word. So in the interest of preserving history and helping a community I'm entreating you guys to vote for us. All that's needed to vote is an email address and a zip code and it doesn't take more than a minute.

It's historical fact with fiction (supposedly) only in dialogue and thought.  For example, the only thing that is fiction is his thought process and feelings which are still as accurate as possible to what they actually were probably feeling.

It's a good read, the only thing added was dialogue and I think the author did extremely well at getting to the head of America's historic figures.

Rise to Rebellion is the prelude to the actual revolution, which is the actual revolution unfolding.  I'm definitely going to read it next.

All other aspects of the context of each strip are easily deciphered

In the former strip, college students Mike Doonesbury and Mark Slackmeyer have gone to Washington, D.C. to take part in a ""Peace March"" (likely inspired by the planned [May Day Protests] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_May_Day_Protests)), and they remain to hobnob with politicians and journalists.

The surname Alsop mentioned in the strip refers to Joe Alsop, Nixon critic, and two-time Pulitzer Prizewinner.

I've decided that the ""Bundy"" mention in this strip refers to McGeorge Bundy for two reasons: First

In the latter strip, college student B.D. is researching the origins of the Vietnam War for a Political Science paper, and calls a Bundy brother (said to have ""advised [President] Johnson"" to escalate the war) to inquire about the origins of U.S. involvement. The unspecified Bundy blames Kennedy/Johnson Defense Secretary Robert McNamara instead.

Both Bundys served as advisors to President Johnson, the Wikipedia article for William Bundy claims (without reference to a primary source) that William was considered ""dovish"" on Vietnam. For these two reasons, I've decided that this mention refers to McGeorge Bundy as well.
