Her name is Karen, and deserves so much better than the actions shown by those in this video.  Let's figure out ways to show her that there are still good people out there...

We have recently had a big surge of new subscribers to this great community

May we all share and enjoy many more great stories like these together... Now I have 2 very brief and important favors/updates to ask/share with you all. 

**IMPORTANT STORY ONE:**

/u/ehcolem has done a tremendous job recently of finding and sharing great stories for this subreddit that we all love and enjoy.  In fact

That being said, and I figured it would be much better served by opening it up to this community to do so as well.  So if you are so inclined, please click on this link and ""Like"" or ""Vote"" for the cause listed and hopefully good things will happen:  http://on.fb.me/RCJ1l7


**IMPORTANT STORY TWO:**

The second update is one many of you are familiar with, that filmmaker, /u/nirvan has been a redditor for over 2 years now, and recently dropped by our small subreddit to answer questions and help promote the next phase of this incredible story.  Please [watch this great video if you haven't before,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Ul9c-4dX4Hk) and share any feedback you think is relevant.  Also, mark your calendar for this global upcoming event on October 6th and feel free to get others involved!

Thanks again for being awesome people

Yours truly

-Did you actually click on that upward facing arrow over there so it turned orange, I just wanted you to stop for a moment and think about it.-

What began 19 days ago as a simple idea to have an escape from the depressing, 2,500 subscribers and countless other readers/lurkers.  And what a community it is!  Initially consisting mostly of people coming from /r/WTF , we have added subscribers from a variety of other subreddits, ranging from /r/aww to /r/depression .  You all have not only gotten along well with each other, but have maintained the positivity and uplifting attitudes implied by the mission statement without any rules and hardly any moderation.  Based on what I have seen in other subreddits, this is no small feat!

So the question I pose to all of you now is, change etc…?  I’m not the power-trip type and karma is only relevant to me to see what kind of stories seem to resonate with people, so feel free to voice your opinion and share your ideas here in the comments.

The one favor I ask of you is to share any stories you encounter in the future that you think might be a good fit here.  Sadly, uplifting stories is harder then one might expect.  Simply search for “good Samaritan” in Google news, and you’ll notice half of the articles will be about somebody getting mugged, taken advantage of, or even killed for their actions.  I’ve had some success searching news for certain key words such as “kindness,” “community rallied,” “heartwarming” etc… so feel free to use this tactic to source your stories.

Actually, feel free to share this sub in a similar way with others.  The more people we get here, the more exposure we’ll get to great stories we might not know about or that don’t pop up in Google searches.  

That’s about all I can think of for now.  In the future it might be fun to open up discussion for ways we all have improved our attitudes, thanks for your support, and thanks for making this a great community.

So during this Holiday Season I want to thank you for your support, and I’m looking forward to continuing this journey with all of you.  And as a small token of thanks, I will be offering some “BestOf” awards in the coming weeks once I figure out the categories and the most optimal ways to vote.

I'm still the only human moderator in here, whom I added for kicks a few months ago.  I'm pretty sure none of them are even aware of this place, but if you send us a modmail message, there is always a slim chance one of them might see it!  Otherwise they just go to me, and I usually enjoy them.

**UPLIFTING REDDIT:**

Now as a few of the older members here know,000th subscriber, I thought I'd draw attention to a developing ""uplifting news"" story.

**Darien Long** is a self-employed mall manager in a gritty area in Atlanta, 3 videos recorded in May of last year went viral, which showed the difficulties he faced dealing with these dangerous trouble makers.

I won't link these videos here because there is nothing uplifting about them, calm demeanor and slight stature really resonated with a lot of people: 

**[News Story](http://www.wsbtv.com/videos/news/residents-say-crime-is-keeping-people-from/vpWJb/)**

So today, described all of the great people on reddit that support him, and created this fundraiser to get him new gear, a vacation, a few cases of beer, or whatever he wants:

The horrific events of last week were a stark reminder that there are still people out there willing to terrorize and kill innocent civilians.  But more importantly

I'm well aware that these events brought many new folks to this little corner of the internet seeking more positive, and I really hope this trend continues.  

I've always purposely avoided posting rules and guidelines for stories and comments here because it should be fairly obvious

**CALL TO ARMS #3**

Now those that have been here a while know that every now and then we react to a story and take a bit of action as a community

**[CLICK HERE FOR PETITION LINK](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/award-carlos-arredondo-presidential-citizens-medal-exemplary-deeds-boston-marathon-april-15-2013/kcS2CGm2)**

All you need to do is click on this link to register/sign the petition, the Obama Administration will address this worthwhile effort.  More importantly, after clicking on the link, please feel free to share it with colleagues, friends and family if you are so compelled, so more people can assist in recognizing his heroic act that day.

Carlos has had an interesting, but none of this is terribly relevant to his actions that day.

At a time when nearly everybody was running away from the explosion

His quick actions and disregard for his own safety arguable saved the life of Jeff Bauman

So please consider signing the petition and sharing it with others to show your support that his actions be recognized.  As for some of the victims of the tragedy, I have summarized a list of all legitimate fundraisers that I'm aware of, and will edit in any more that are discovered later:

* [Jeff Bauman](http://www.gofundme.com/BucksforBauman)

* [Celeste and Sydney](http://www.gofundme.com/CelesteandSydney)

After reading it, but I also saw that a lot of his collection remained unsold and a thought occurred to me.

Why not start a fundraising campaign to buy as many of his comics as we could so we could give them right back to him?  I have no lofty expectations for this endeavor

So if you feel so inclined

**[HELP KARL KESEL KEEP HIS COMIC BOOK COLLECTION](https://www.crowdtilt.com/campaigns/help-karl-kesel-keep-his-comic-collection)** 

My understanding is that crowdtilt is the official group funding partner of reddit

Depending on the amount raised

There is no contribution that is too small

Let's make this happen!

EDIT:  So I just realized that the current Crowdtilt setup is $5,000, no money is raised and nobody is charged anything (but Karl gets nothing either).  No big deal, but I guess I'll have to gauge the progress and see if a smaller target amount is more attainable.  Sorry for the confusion there.  If we do ""tilt"" I'll simply create another one.

**UPDATE: 8/27**  Crowdtilt has graciously allowed me to lower the target amount to ensure funds are raised and comics are purchased for the Kesel Family.  

In addition, and is glad to hear that it moved strangers around the globe to want to help.

I have also had some great conversations with Amy of the “I Love Comics” store located in Vancouver

More importantly, or are buying random issues that have no cohesion.

So the plan now is for the fundraiser to end Friday, and for me to purchase said comics from the site and ship them back to Karl.

The story behind it isn't so feel-good (apologies). I follow the adoption blogs of people adopting special needs children from countries in which special needs orphans aren't given the care they need. As a result

My favorite is Katie.

[This](http://theblessingofverity.com/wp-content/uploads/797_25.05.2009_Veronika044-450x506.jpg) is Katie before she was adopted. She's *9-years-old* in this photograph. She has down syndrome

[This](http://theblessingofverity.com/wp-content/uploads/2012-07-17-001-2012-07-17-003-450x600.jpg) is Katie after living with her adopted family for less than a year.
