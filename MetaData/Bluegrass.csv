1343076899.0,x1ad6,Played bluegrass at a wedding - suprised at the reception,banjoman74,63,9,21,"A very nice experience I thought I would share. Forgive me for the length (and the bad pun).

We were hired to perform this past weekend in a small town called Elko BC (near Fernie). The Friday night we performed at a community hall and then Saturday we played a wedding. The father of the bride is a huge fan

So we played background music

So it was a typical wedding dance. Most of the guys were outside drinking and enjoying the beautiful evening. Most of the girls were on the dance floor dancing to 80s, Rhianna). He says the bride would really like us to play. Thinking that it was more the father wanting us to play, I asked the bride. She informed us she was hoping we would do another set, and that her friends would love to have us play, but that in no way should we feel obliged. I told her we'd do a short, quick set.

Well we get on stage to massive cheers. The groom heads outside and tells his friends that band is back on stage. We start playing ""Washington County Breakdown"" and EVERYONE is on the floor dancing. We keep kicking off tunes and everyone is dancing and drinking and cheering - pumping their arms in the air. It was very surreal. We do about an hour. Our bass player is starting to nod off a little at this point, so he picks one with two chords. I say I'll stay up with him so he's not all by himself and we'll do one more song for the bride. Halfway through our fiddle player comes back on and our guitar player picks up bass. The bride and her friend join us on stage and dance beside us. Then someone asks us to play ""Wagon Wheel."" And our encore turns into another mini-set.

I love moments like that as a musician. They're completely spontaneous

1368294902.0,1e4zrn,58957 - Tony Rice's Guitar (the story as I know it),banjoman74,20,2,4,"I know Fretboard Journal a while back did a story on Tony Rice's (or Clarence White's) guitar. I thought I would tell the story as I know it.

Roland and Clarence were in McCabe's in Los Angeles where they spotted a prewar D28 Martin guitar in the corner. It was... to say the least... in rough shape. It had no fretboard and the soundhole had been enlarged. The top had been sanded extremely thin and there was no pickguard

Clarence and Roland went home and told their dad all about the guitar. They went in together and ended up buying the guitar for $35.00 (Roland says $25). Clarence's father had McCabe put a Gretsch fretboard on the guitar. And McCabe told Clarence and Roland that they would have to use light strings on it since the top was so shaved. They brought it home and instantly put heavy strings on it

Clarence had a love-hate relationship with the guitar. It was extremely temperamental. They got so frustrated with it one time they shot it with a BB gun. For flatpicking

In 1975 Tony Rice was able to track down 58957. He bought the guitar for $550 from Joe Miller in Pasadena California. It was almost unplayable. Tony had a bunch of work done on it... and there are a lot of rumours surrounding the guitar. The main one is that he got the top completely redone with all the marks, at one time, been shaved down. Tony says the only major repairs, besides refrets and neck adjustments, were done in 1981 - a crack in the side of the guitar was repaired and the bridge was replaced (by Hideo Kamimoto in California).

That was until 1993. The guitar was involved in a flood (in fact... floating in Tony's living room). Chris Martin and Mike Longworth with Martin offered to fix the guitar, Tony was willing to play the guitar again.

I have had a chance to talk to some people who have played the guitar (I have not). They say it is a temperamental beast. But

First, have sat pretty high up with a few symphony orchestras (one of them professional), played for musicals, operas, etc. etc. But I think I'm ready to move on from that life. My real passion is being able to get ""off the page,"" if you will, and move into the world of real bluegrass fiddling. I've been listening to a ton of music that is so far outside of my comfort zone lately (Ralph Stanley, Chris Thile)

So, where do I even start with getting resources? I'm used to spending 3-5 hours in a practice room daily, so there's no hesitation on my part to put in the work, I just don't know what to work *on*. I have a book of fiddle tunes, and that's nice to play through for stylistic things, but it also feels like that's reinforcing my habit of being entirely stuck in the music, not able to really get out of it. Where do I start?

It almost feels like we should completely abandon the traditional route of bluegrass and focus more on the progressive stuff. [Here's a version of Across the Great Divide"" we recorded in our bass player's living room](https://soundcloud.com/thebixmixboys/across-the-great-divide). Additionally

I'm almost thinking even these ones are still too traditional
