If its not here then the skill works exactly as it says in the tooltip.

After many hours of testing this is what I have.

____
General combat

* Kill skills last **7 seconds**

* Melee attacks crit for **2x** damage and none of the critical hit damage bonuses change that.

* The melee damage bonus % found on weapons is multiplicative rather than additive

____
***Zero***
____


* **Deception** 

Action Skill. Press button to create a holographic decoy and vanish for a few seconds**(6 seconds)**. The longer you are invisible the more Damage your next attack deals

**A minimum of  230%** up to +650% Melee Damage

**A minimum of 40%** Up to +200% Gun Damage

~~Up to +250% Gun Critical Hit Damage~~

Lies. **Deception does not give any Critical him damage increase** at all

_____
***Bloodshed***


* **Killing blow**

When exactly is an enemy  **""low on health""** ? 

When below **30% health**.

The damage bonus from this skill is multiplicative rather than additive

* **Execute**

How much exactly is this **""massive damage""** ?

This skill changes the melee damage bonus of deception from 

A minimum of 230% up to 650% Melee damage to

**A minimum of 460% up to 1400% increased Melee damage**

* **Many must fall**

How much time does it add to the duration of Deception ?

**~2 seconds**
_____

***Cunning***

* **Counter Strike**

What activates it ? 

Bullets and melee attacks definitely do

* **Ambush**

Do I get the bonus if enemies are targeting my decoy ? 

**Yes**

* **Unforeseen**

Do the additional decoys created by **Many must fall explode** ?

**Yes.**

* **Death Mark**

The damage bonus is multiplicative or additive ?

**Multiplicative.**

* **Death Blossom**

You throw 4 daggers at a time and you can do that 5 times. They can have any of the 5 elemental types. This skill is a very reliable way of applying slag and overall it does fantastic damage on its own.

To apply **Death mark** you have to directly hit an enemy

___
***Sniping***

* **Kill Confirmed**

How long does it take to get the full bonus ?

**~ 2.7 seconds**

* **Critical Ascension**

You start losing stacks after **6 seconds.**

You lose 1 stack Per second.

Switching weapon, quest log, etc), using a vending machine, talking to a quest giver and dieing instantly removes all stacks.

You can melee

___

***Gaige***
___

* **Summon Deathtrap**

60 seconds cooldown
___
***Ordered Chaos***

* **Robot Rampage**

**Cooldown - 13 seconds.**

Misleading tooltip. It's not 7 attacks

DT spins for 2 seconds dealing 9 attacks to all enemies near him. Each of those 9 attacks does 62% of his normal melee attack damage. At the end of his spin he does an instant normal attack with no delay for full damage.


In other words

* **Discord**

Cost - **1.33 stacks per second.**

* **Death from Above**

Cooldown - 2 seconds.

Sadly this awesome skill was not implemented very well. You don't have full control over when it activates. Shooting while walking on uneven surfaces or getting hit by bullets and getting lifting inches off the ground as result can activate this skill.  As a result investing in this skill can makes managing your Anarchy stacks much harder.

* **The Nth Degree**

**Do NOT invest more than one point in this skill.**

In the best case scenario (if there are always enemies in range) you will get 11.1% damage increase from this skill. This is not a bad deal

* **With Claws**

At the cost of 1 Anarchy stack you do 2 swipes

At 1% heath this skill heals for up to ~**30%** of your heath per swipe. At 90% health it will heal for ~5% of your health.

Also important to note is that because of both swipes do full melee damage and the speed at which you can use this attack this skill effectively gives you **50%  increased melee attack speed.**

___
***Little Big Trouble***

* **The Stare**

**Cooldown - 15 seconds.**

Does high amount of burn damage to a **single target.**

Not affected by Evil Enchantress or badass rank bonuses.

* **Shock Storm**

Can activate Electrical burn even if created by Deathtrap.

* **One Two Boom**

**Cooldown - 42 seconds.**

Cannot be activated with E-tech weapons.

* **Interspersed Outburst**

First stack after **2 seconds** of not shooting.

Full stacks after **9.3 seconds** of not shooting.

**The damage is based on character level and the number of stacks only.** It will do the same damage with 1 or 5 points invested.
**The chance to slag is 2% per rank for each stack.** So with 5 stacks at rank 5 the chance to slag is 50%.

This is how it works in TVHM, but investing points in to it did.


***Make It Sparkle***

Each of his melee attacks does additional damage equal to **2x** his base melee damage.

Because it takes the base damage and not the actual damage Strength of 5 Gorillas

The elemental damage he does is also affected by the elemental damage type multipliers. So for example if Deathtrap does 1000 damage with his melee attacks and you slag him

**But there is more

This is because it does the full bonus elemental damage on each attack.

Let me toss some numbers at you.

My level 39 Deathtrap does 5500 damage with his melee attack. If I send him with no upgrades vs a Super Badass Loader he will do 11k damage in 2 seconds.

If he has Make it Sparkle and Robot Rampage and I give him corrosive attacks he will do:

36190 damage normal damage + 192500 corrosive damage.

**So from 11k to 229k damage in 2 seconds.**

And I could slag that enemy for him
___
***Best Friends Forever***

* **Buck Up**

**Cooldown - 18 seconds.**

Because of a bug Deathtrap will sometimes use this ability on your enemies.

In True Vault Hunter Mode it only restores 30% of your shields.

Because of this in TVHM this skill is a complete waste of Deathtraps time and should always be avoided.

I can't test this any more, but when I tested it in TVHM it was only restoring 30%(as the tooltip states). Going back to Normal mode after I have unlocked TVHM does not change that.

* **Explosive Clap**

**Cooldown - 25 seconds.**

Does pretty good amount of damage in a very large radius.

* **Sharing is Caring**

Deathtrap does not benefit from the special effect of Amp Shields.

Spike

Absorb shields do not give you ammo

Don't have a way of testing if Turtle shields reduce his heath or do adaptive shields boost his health and resistances.

___

***Maya***
___
* **Phaselock**

How long does it last by default ?

**5 seconds**
___
***Cataclysm***

* **Flicker**

How does it work ?

It increases the chance to apply an elemental effect that the weapon has by said %.
(example

* **Helios**

Does it apply to targets that cannot be phaselocked ?

**Yes.**

* **Ruin**

How does it work ?

It creates 3  explosions with the center being the phaselocked target. Slag

___
***Harmony***

* **Life tap**

How does it work ?

Instantly restores health equal to x% of any damage you do. Works with  guns, melee attacks, damage over time effects, any damage you do.

* **Scorn**

How does it work ? 

Sends out a slow moving orb that explodes on impact doing minor slag damage. While flying the orb also sends out slag tendrils to all enemies around it

___
***Motion***

* **Kinetic Reflection**

Can I become immune to bullets if I have 10 points in to this skill ?

**Yes.**

* **Sub-Sequence**

How does it work ?

Once the phaselocked target dies the spell starts moving the same way homing grenades do and seeks another target.

While the spell is moving to another target the duration of phaselock keeps going down. Also when its seeking another target Wreck

Every time it hits a new target Converge and Helios are reapplied.

* **Thoughtlock**

Do Converge, Chain reaction and Elated work with Thoughtlock ?

**Yes.**


___
***Salvador***
___

* **Gunzerking**

By default this skill lasts 20 seconds and provides 33.3% damage reduction.

___
***Brawn***

* **I'm the Juggernaut**

At 5 points the 20% damage reduction you are supposed to get is more like ~16.5%. It's a great skill nonetheless.

When combined with **Gunzerking** it results in 41% damage reduction.

* **Fistful of Hurt**

How much is ""massive damage"" ?

**300%** increased melee damage (multiplicative).

* **Come At Me Bro**

How much damage reduction do I get and how long does it last ?

The buff lasts **8 seconds** and it increases the damage reduction to **66.6%**. 

When combined with **I'm the Juggernaut**(5 points) it results in  ~ 71% damage reduction.

___
***Rampage***


* **Get Some**

It is important to note that this skill also works while you are **Gunzerking**


* **Keep Firing...**


How does it work ?

You just have to keep your finger on the triggers

Reloading does not seem to affect the bonus fire rate.


Not sure exactly how long it takes to get the maximum bonuses

____
***Gun Lust***

* **All I Need is One**

Best thing about this skill is that it works with rocket launchers.

* **Money Shot**

Does not work with Rocket Launchers. 

No all that great when using TORGUE weapons because of the way explosive weapon damage is calculated.

With 5 points in the skill the damage bonus for **clip size** is as follows:

1 = 0% (You sttil hear the sound

2 = 80%

3 = 120%

4 = 160%

5 = 200%

6 = 240%

7 = 280%

8 = 320%

9 = 360%

10 = 400%

**11 = 440%!**

**12+ = 480%!**

I had to farm the Warrior for white items with small clip sizes to test this

* **Keep It Piping Hot**

Because of a bug this skill does not work if you have any cooldown reduction bonuses.

* **No Kill Like Overkill**

How does it work ?

It works exactly as it says

The cap is 5x as much damage as you would do with no overkill bonus. That damage bonus is multiplicative and is applied at the end of the equation.

Whatever damage you can do without the overkill bonus you can do up to 5 times as much damage with the overkill bonus
For example if you can hit a slagged target for 100k damage with the bonus from ""All I need is one"" and ""Money Shot"" and no Overkill bonus

At least that is how I think it works

***Axton***

* **Sabre Turret**

How long does it last by default ?

23 seconds

___

***Gunpowder***

* **Steady**

This skill states that it increases grenade damage

* **Do or die**

Same thing as **Steady.**

* **Battlefront** 

Same as the two above

* **Nuke**

Is there any way to increase the damage this thing does ?

Slag the target before deploying the turret

____
***Guerrilla***

* **Scorched Earth**

Equipping your turret with rocked pods also decreases the damage the gun of the turret does by **13%**
 
* **Double Up**

This upgrade also decreases the gun damage by **13%**. This results in a **74%** increased damage  for having 2 guns rather than the 100% increase that you would expect. 
If you combine this with rocket pods then you will be only getting **54%** increased turret gun damage.

If you take Gemini without pods then you will have 100% increased turret gun damage

All of that does not mean that rocket pods are not worth it.

We've implemented a couple new features to *try* and help some of you folk from being plot-spoiled.  If you happen to bypass these things and ruin the story for yourself



1.  Starting Sept 17th


2.  We've put in place a new link flair that will completely hide title text on /r/borderlands front page.  This won't work for your general reddit front page but it'll have a spoiler tag there.  [Here](http://imgur.com/a/OYVUu) is what that looks like.


3.  Updated comment spoiler tags.  If you're going to talk about the BL2 story in the comments section

[text goes here\](/spoiler)

[text goes here](/spoiler)


[text goes here\](/spoiler ""BL2"")

[text goes here](/spoiler ""BL2"")


You can optionally replace BL2 with BL1....just whatever you want to use.  If you don't even want use those

**If we receive reports that your comment is not properly marked


----


I think that's all for the new features.  Now


**SPOILER FLAIR:**  We will be closely moderating this subreddit over the next week to try and stop spoilers from being posted.  Remember

* [Hit this button](http://i.imgur.com/vZ1EX.png).  This will take you to the flair box.

* Hit [the spoiler button and then SAVE](http://i.imgur.com/x4Wmw.png).  

**Note: If you fail to do this and we catch it



**Youtube channels/playthroughs:**  It's fine if you post these during next week.  It's fine if you want to post loot chest unboxing videos/imgur albums.  Those don't necessarily have to be marked as spoilers since we're just worried about the story of the game.  If you say **ANYTHING** about the story

*/r/borderlands will not make your youtube channel an official channel/playthrough channel or advertise your videos in any way.  Sorry.  We're not picking favorites or inadvertently generating your ad revenue.*



**EDIT**  Text posts only means no linked topic titles outside of this subreddit.  You can link to these pics/loot/youtubes inside your self post just make sure you mark your topic as spoilers.  That's what the whole spoilers feature is all about.



That's all.  Let's all have fun next week!  ...and...

1351352513.0,126c3x,A Personal thanks to GearBox for being an awesome developer,,1040,239,203,"**First and foremost

I write this

1. The time the codes go live
2. The Length the codes are active
3. The fact the codes go down 3 minutes before the actual end-time
4. The fact the keys aren't just **given** to our accounts

This here, outside of the fact they advertised the **Golden Chest** as part of the game, and even still they could give these codes out **only** in contests.

But **NO**. They choose to give these codes out **constantly and for free**

1. Twitter
2. Facebook
3. /r/Borderlands

They do not ask you to pay them for it, and that is that **YOU DO NOTHING but check their pages**.

And to top it off, so even people in other timezones have a fair chance to get them. You missed out on **two codes** because they were up at 4am EST? Well cry me a river you pompous fuck. Other people only got **4-6** because they live in an entirely different timezone. God forbid your entitled ass has to wait up to **FOUR** days to get MORE FREE KEYS.

Any other publisher or developer wouldn't be doing this. They'd be making gimmicky contests, pay or do some other jump-through-hoop bullshit at chances to open a chest that has awesome shit in it. Instead, they give you **10 KEYS TO USE WHICH HAS MULTIPLE ITEMS IN THE FUCKING CHEST ANYWAYS**.

So **thank you GearBox!**. Thank you for understanding how a developer should act. So far you have managed to do the following:

1. Create day-1 pre-order bonuses that give an advantage to people for about 25 minutes of gameplay
2. Create day-1 pre-order DLC for a character you didn't have finished
3. Stayed true to the franchise and
4. Let us see [Fyrestone again... thank you **SO** much for this..](/spoiler)
5. Took us on an emotional rollercoaster
6. Are constantly giving your community something that almost any other developer would be selling or advertising in some way to gain them and their company.

You guys have, and I look forward to supporting you guys every way I can as long as you stay on this track.",,False,self,t5_2r8cd,False,,

Hey guys! I saw there were 7 posts today asking about DLC level scaling, and that post is on the *third* page of the sub (#58 as of now), people don't SEE anything about the DLC. Add in a touch of classic ""I don't need to use the search bar"" and you get the current situation. As such, I've compiled a bit of info from helpful posts/comments to hopefully put together something worthy of the sidebar or FAQ. (I say that because there is such a ""When should I play the DLC?"" post in the BL1 section of the FAQ).

**THE SEASON PASS**

Many people have had threads downvoted to Dagon's plane for asking about this. This is kind of understandable as not many of the immediate google search results are entirely clear. Heck, enabling pearlescent weapons to drop in UVHM), all for the price of 3 individual campaign DLCs. Well worth the money. It does not include [Krieg](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Krieg) or 
[Gaige](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Gaige), it was not stated that Gaige came with the season pass. If you didn't pay for her (and didn't pirate her or something) then you preordered the game.

**I ONLY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO GET (n) DLCs

Generally it would be recommended that you wait until you can afford the season pass. It's cheaper than all the campaign DLC individually and includes the Ultimate Vault Hunter Upgrade Pack (worst named DLC ever: this is the levels 51-61 pack). Unless you are hell-bent on getting Krieg or Gaige (I certainly was for Gaige), in order of decreasing awesomeness:

* [Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Tiny_Tina%27s_Assault_on_Dragon_Keep) (Accessed at ""Unassuming Docks"" in Fast Travel)
* [Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Mr._Torgue%27s_Campaign_of_Carnage) (Accessed at ""Badass Crater of Badassitude"" in Fast Travel)
* [Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Captain_Scarlett_and_Her_Pirate's_Booty) (Accessed at ""Oasis"" in Fast Travel)
* [Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Sir_Hammerlock's_Big_Game_Hunt) (Accessed at ""Hunter's Grotto"" in Fast Travel)

However this is merely a guide

In terms of character DLC, I think you'll find DT to be a (slightly buggy) breath of fresh air. You now have a *[moving](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4wmujqL0f1qf1ln8.gif)* source of damage! Of course this is harder for me to quantify and give an objective opinion on, as not every player uses Krieg for melee or Gaige for Deathtrap, for example.

**DLC LEVEL SCALING OF QUESTS AND ENEMIES**

The levels of the enemies and missions in the DLCs are as follows: 

* Captain Scarlett and her Pirate's Booty - levels 15 to 30
* Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage - levels 15 to 30
* Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt - levels 30 to 35
* Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep - levels 30 to 35

*As /u/Danarhys pointed out

In True Vault Hunter Mode (TVHM),35,35 respectively)* until level 50.

In Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (UVHM)

Taken from /u/intergalacticninja's comment [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1h80yo/should_i_just_skip_all_of_the_dlcs_in_the_1st/carrfcb). The italics bit is mine

**WHAT ORDER SHOULD I DO THEM IN? SHOULD I DO THEM NOW OR LATER?**

The following assumes you own all 4 campaign DLCs either by purchasing the Season Pass

In normal mode you can start them as soon as you're at the lower level limit, playthrough 2. You won't get much XP for enemies and quests that are levels below you, and all gear will be capped at 30 or 35 anyway, so unless there's a particular item you want from a DLC quest, I wouldn't stress about fully completing them.

You need to be a bit careful in TVHM, to minimise your ability to level up thereafter. This is (in practise) to prevent you grinding to level 61 and entering UVHM only to fight level 63 badasses (or level [66 Dukes of Ork](/spoiler)) with you level 50 legendary weapons you've farmed. I guarantee you will be ~~touched in places by herbert~~ struggling to a Dark Souls/Demon Souls degree. The difference between a level 50 DPUH (a specific, powerful, and desirable variant of the [Unkempt Harold](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Unkempt_Harold)), which can do 15145x2 damage (item card damage, from [wiki](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Unkempt_Harold/Variant_Chart)) and a level 61 version which coud deal 58923x2 (same source as above) is incredible. Your level 50 gear is worthless at L61, with the possible exception of the Slagga, plus whatever else you feel you need or just want.

Once you get to UVHM, and you can reset the playthrough once you get to 61 if you decide you want a level 61 version and aren't up to trade/dupe for one. The DLCs all scale all the time in UVHM (as does the rest of the game) so you can do literally anything, one you don't mind resetting the PT at some stage.

**CONCLUSION**

Hopefully this puts to rest some of the confusion floating around here. I guarantee there are typos and probably broken links

Peace out!

* **TORGUE WEAPONS EXPLODE

Get the picture? TORGUE is all about turning your enemies in piles of glump while you walk about their dangling limbs. TORGUE is all about using CAPITAL LETTERS. TORGUE is all about receiving ***ridiculous*** damage increases due to game mechanics. 

[Summary: TORGUE is the most badass manufacturer to ever send guns to Pandora.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_sy4tXtjjY)

Now you may ask ""But fellow Vault Hunter

Answer: You never did the **MATH** behind TORGUE weapons. That's what this guide is for!

**TORGUE MATH TIME**

Our lovely explosive test subject for today is a finely crafted [Hand Cannon](http://i.imgur.com/kBpO2.jpg). At an impressive 7

Now

* You hit the target
* You critically hit the target (good job!)
* You miss the target
* You miss the target completely (this disappoints TORGUE)

First, badass points, or any other kind of buff active, and with our 7,645 Damage pistol:

* Splash Damage: 7
* Hit: 15
* Critical Hit: 22

So! Our little pistol has the capability to deal **22,645. 

Now

* Splash Damage: 9
* Hit: 18
* Critical Hit: 27

Looking good so far. One skill in and we've multiplied our Damage an additional **360%** versus our base 7

Next

**TORGUE weapons benefit from BOTH Gun AND Grenade damage bonuses!**

* Splash Damage: 11
* Hit: 20
* Critical Hit: 29

Here is where the calculations become tricky. Due to TORGUE weapons receiving both Gun and Grenade damage bonuses, the % Damage multipliers start to be a bit skewed.

A quick tip: TORGUE guns are considered to be **ELEMENTAL** and do **not** receive either bonus Gun Damage or Fire Rate from Axton's Duty Calls skill.

Another **10% Grenade Damage** from 5/5 Axton's Do or Die skill.

* Splash Damage: 12
* Hit: 21
* Critical Hit: 30

A quick **5% Gun Damage and 5% Critical Hit Damage** from 5/5 Axton's Ranger skill.

* Splash Damage: 12
* Hit: 22
* Critical Hit: 32

An extra **26% Explosive Damage** from an Explosive Damage Relic.

* Splash Damage: 16
* Hit: 28
* Critical Hit: 41

Grenadier Class Mod grants **31% Grenade Damage**.

* Splash Damage: 19
* Hit: 32
* Critical Hit: 45

Almost near the end here. We're already at a massive **592% damage increase!** We have one final skill to work into our TORGUE masterpiece

* Splash Damage: 29
* Hit: 44
* Critical Hit: 60

**Smokin' Jesus titty cinnamon! 793% DAMAGE INCREASE!**

Here it is fellow Vault Hunters. Our TORGUE pistol, is dealing [60,615 Damage a shot!](http://i.imgur.com/ioH17.jpg) This was also done without any skill bonuses from the class mod, a white pistol, and zero baddass-rank bonuses. These numbers easily have the potential to be even higher. Consider TORGUE shotguns for example.

For the lazy: The Dropbox link is [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8990060/The_Aspiring_Vault_Hunters_Guidebook_To_BL2.pdf)

This originally started as a UVHM FAQ, only 15 pages + a cover page, but hopefully it'll answer most of the more basic questions that many of you have. It's not intended to cover the most detailed nuances of game mechanics (save those in Numbers, because they confuse many people). This was made with the Steam Summer Sale in mind (i.e. more noobies looking for help on the basics, hence ""Aspiring"") though covers mechanics for all three platforms. 

It quickly became apparent that this was going to be too long to post directly to reddit. About 1/4 of the way in it was over the 10k character limit for a post, so I decided to scrap the reddit syntax and convert everything into a .pdf. It was at that point that I enlisted the help of the fantastic /u/ohenry78! He did pretty much everything other than write the guide, though he did make numerous small contributions (mostly things I forgot) that netted him co-author status. He did a fantastic job, and I am very happy to have had the opportunity to do this with him.

Some things to note about this guide:

* It's made so you can print it off. There is no hard-copy guide from Gearbox
* It contains no information on creatures/enemies; this will likely be included when the file gets updated when new DLC is released.
* The file is a .pdf hosted in my own dropbox account (edit: and now MEGA). As stated in the file, so shouldn't mysteriously disappear at any point.
* The entirety of the contents section is intra-linked within the document. Click on ""Character Selection"" and you'll be brought straight there! The same goes for any italicised mention of the various sections of the guide. This was entirely /u/ohenry78's doing

So, and provides more than a dozen links to different guides, infographics, and subreddits. feel free to download this and enjoy!

I'll add more to that album later. Anyway, some Hyperion soldiers for a border patrol, and regular bandits who just want to play with the giant monsters/ use them to take over the world. Just think about psychos trying to wrangle a giant skag/ thresher thing or whatever the skull in that first pic belongs to.

I only use the word ""dinosaurs"" for lack of a better term. I don't mean like Tyrannosauruses and shit. I was thinking more along the lines of ""what came before the skags"" and ""what did that bigass skull belong to"" and ""what outlived the warrior""


Also, I'll just go with my theory that Pandora is Earth and Borderlands is a sequel to Waterworld (the Kevin Costner movie from the 90's) where the water lowered.~~

http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/09/18/game-theory-borderlands-2-fails-to-generate-joy-puke/

EDIT: By request

Ask me what I think about Borderlands 2 from Gearbox Software, though, would I ever say I was ready to “joy puke” my face off, as the game box predicts players will do.

The sequel to the highly acclaimed 2009 Borderlands game goes on shelves Tuesday in Xbox 360, published by 2K Games, inevitably invites comparisons with the Halos and Calls of Duty games already out and due to come in the next few weeks and months. Borderlands 2 falls short because it’s missing several key elements you need to have in a 2012 first-person shooter game – most notably, a rich multiplayer online mode. There’s an extremely limited four-player cooperative mode, and if you have an Xbox Live Gold account, you can team up that way, but this isn’t the type of deeply engrossing FPS game the headset-wearing COD crowds gather to play months and months after release. In comparison, for a total of 18 simultaneous players

It’s apparent that Borderlands 2 is going after that testosterone-filled, gratuitous cussing in the game and prominent placement of a pre-order advertisement on the ESPN.com homepage. I played the Xbox version of Borderlands 2 for close to a week, and while the development and upgrades from the original are apparent, the quirk and novelty that made the 2009 game so endearing and popular (according to VGChartz.com), combined unit sales of the original topped 4.5 million for the PS3, Xbox 360 and PC) feel dated and tired in this game.

Borderlands 2 doesn’t just bill itself as an FPS. It’s a space Western FPS or a role-playing shooter, you’re expected to fight your way across Pandora, hoping to stop Handsome Jack from awakening “the Warrior,” an alien even more evil than he is. The events in Borderlands 2 take place several years after the original game and are a continuation of those events, albeit with four new playable characters.

I had to go back to Wikipedia descriptions of the original game to remember all the intricate twists and turns of the Borderlands backstory, hoping to find a vault filled with high-tech alien weapons after finding a similar one on a neighboring planet. Alas, Atlas didn’t realize what a hellhole Pandora was in summer, when horrifying alien monsters come out of hibernation, and abandoned the planet. Enter Dahl, which basically pillaged Pandora for the sake of mining its resources, using convict labor that it shipped in. Complicating the already complicated plot, actually did find the mysterious vault. When Atlas heard that, leaving behind the poor

In this new game, Salvador the so-called “Gunzerker,” Zero the Assassin, or Maya the Siren – each fully customizable in appearance and each displaying unique traits. The game’s opening sequence reminds you that Borderlands’ developers chose to go the animation route, and I don’t like it very much. The game isn’t manga-like enough to be super-hip, so instead, it just feels cartoonish. Menacing characters like Handsome Jack, are not at all fearsome. Your four heroes from the first game all appear as non-playable characters in this game. They are pretty cool in conception and rendering.

Also back is Claptrap, and is a fairly detestable character, who left me cold. When his camera eye got plucked out by an alien on the first mission, I didn’t care. Still, I had no choice but to go out and put my Zero character at risk to restore the loathsome droid’s sight.

Borderlands 2’s single-player campaign mode isn’t as good as what you’ll find in games like COD: Black Ops or the Medal of Honor series. There’s too much “feast-or-famine” hunting for tasks

I played with my 14-year-old son, due to the cartoonish blockiness. The game’s mapping was detailed, though, and at first, it was fun to explore a bit. It became a nuisance later. I was reminded a couple of times of the desolate feeling you have on the road while playing Skyrim and struck by how long it took to get from one action point to another. Luckily, the developers built quick-travel machines into the game, allowing you short-circuit some of that boring travel time.

Controls are very similar to COD, I really got immersed. There were, however, too many interludes between pitched battles. The artificial intelligence of the aliens and other enemies in this game is excellent, and I found it hard to outsmart and outmaneuver them. I tried to outfox stone-throwing monsters by racing from one side of a sheltering shack to another, but they blew my strategy by simply coming at me from all sides, and in numbers. The best way to fight, was to wade right in

The types of guns and sheer number of available weapons in Borderlands 2 is overwhelming. There are pistols, I was able to switch between two different weapons, and had to go into my backpack if I wanted to switch them out. Keeping an inventory of your weapons is a bit complicated as the game goes on, and I found myself holding onto too many guns that were too similar to each other to be of much use. Likewise, you can acquire or purchase better shielding for yourself.

There’s a “fight-for-your-life” mode that lets you get a “second wind” if you kill an alien before your life meter runs out. The game slows down and goes black-and-white during this mode

As a $30 impulse buy, though, I think it’s fair for players to demand the whole magilla – cutting-edge development, engrossing campaign gameplay, scads of downloadable content, a rich social media/community experience, sharing of loot and gear and online multiplayer modes that keep you and your friends coming back until the next version of the game comes out.

And Borderlands 2 misses on enough counts so that I not only didn’t joy puke, I’d at least counsel waiting to compare it to Black Ops 2, due out in mid-November, or Halo 4, which is slated for a December release.",,False,t5_2r8cd,True

1348606817.0,10gy19,Why is there no ECHO playbacks.,Grim-aces,560,90,123,"Let me first start off by saying I love Borderlands 2. But am I the only one who is upset by the removal of the Echo playbacks. I know it is not a big feature but it was one of my favorite little parts from the first one and I have been noticing much to my displeasure it is a feature that needs to be returned.

I have now on four different occasion had my echo dialogue cut out or interrupted by an event in the game. This is horrible just plain damn horrible

One of the things that makes the Borderlands series so great is its dialogue and players are missing out

Cast your minds back to the first game, or scooter's off color white trash comments. No I tell you good sir, no it wouldn't. 

 So you can see why when I miss dialogue my heart sinks because I know I have no way of hearing it again short of starting up a whole new game. It is like I have just been robbed of happiness and say it shouldn't be this way.

To any Gearbox employees reading this post I know you didn't do this on purpose but please hear my plead and try to correct this grievous error if not in 2 but please in 3. 

**Update 1**
Due to the overwhelming opinion on this subject I have fired off a contact request over to Gearbox via their website. I invited them to come over and give their 2 cents on the subject. Hopefully they can answer our question and maybe hear us out. So let's see where we can go with this and if they do show up, I am not going to stomp my feet if they say they can't or won't patch the playback into the game. **I know I am asking much here internet, but be nice.**

**Update 2**
Gearbox never got back with me.

""The drop rates suck""

""They need to fix this""

""Can we all please get Gearbox to notice this thread?""


I'm sure you've all seen these comments and posts. They outnumber the discussion posts 4:1. I'm so sick of seeing these posts constantly on the front page. Has this subreddit just turned into a complaint board? 


The drop rates: Why does everyone cry about this so much? I for one, you will be happy. Try farming Doc Mercy instead of wasting time bitching on this site. 


What good would it do to find all the legendaries? Is it fun to one-shot everything and be OP all the time? Does anyone enjoy a challenge?


The Bee nerf that everyone still wants to talk about: LET IT GO! The devs changed it, LEGENDARY. How would you feel if you spent YEARS of your life drawing a maze and someone cuts all the lines from start to finish, how would you feel? They don't want everyone to one-shot all their creations to get the rarest items in the game easily, and I don't blame them.


I hope that the incessant bitching never gets to Gearbox. If it was up to the user base


Don't like farming for hours? Don't do it then. Weapons of legend don't just fall into the lap of the lazy person. Step up to the challenge

Right

The idea behind the experiment is to serialize a book for free online (on the website) and see if I can monetize it a bit on the side by putting it up in eBook format on Amazon, but its nice to offer an option for people that want to support the idea.

In a nutshell (and hopefully spoiling little, even if they are the thirteen-year-old reincarnation of Albert Einstein. Oh, and there's an unhealthy obsession with tacos sprinkled throughout.

It's unlikely, and are included in the tables).

| Badass → Super | 10% | 20% | 30% | 40% |
| Super → Ultimate | 0% | 1% | 2% | 3% |
| Ultimate → Supreme | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |

| Evolve chance PT2.5 | 1-Player | 2-Player | 3-Player | 4-Player |
| :-- | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| Larval → Adult | 70% | 80% | 90% | 100% |
| Adult → Badass | 40% | 50% | 60% | 70% |

| Larval → Supreme | 1:2381 | 1:417 | 1:141 | 1:60 |

For the most part

As a note, one of which, if you're lucky, will evolve into an Ultimate Badass. The same size group in 4-player mode would give you, on average, 35 Super Badasses, 14 of which would evolve into the Ultimate form, on a good day!). 

**3. Why would I want to try and get him to show up

For the thrill of the hunt

Also, and the legendary Maliwan rocket launcher Norfleet. While you can get the Nasty Surprise and Legendary Class Mods from any suitable loot source, it's important to note that the Norfleet is a Unique weapon, and as such, it will *not* be found in chests, vending machines, or slot machines (though it can drop from Hyperius the Invincible). He also drops a neat head customization for each class that you can't get from any other legitimate source!

**4. Okay cool

The easiest and most popular location is the Tundra Express Farmhouse, you can enter the farmhouse, jump down into the basement, and activate the Fast Travel beacon. There is another fuse box next to the ladder to deactivate the electric barrier next time you travel there. Staying inside the farmhouse is ideal, since it provides a lot of cover from everything except the Badass Varkids, who can still spit powerful attacks through the windows and doorway.

The Caustic Caverns is the other location. It doesn't provide a convenient shelter like the farmhouse, since they can't seem to target their critical locations, and any varkid past the adult stage will easily survive the crystalisk's attacks if it's going to evolve.

There is a third area you can find him, an Ultimate Badass Varkid will enter the arena during the final wave. Farming Vermivorous here of course would mean you can't turn in the mission, so either you would have to save and quit, or deliberately die in order to try it multiple times. This method will probably be most effective for single players, since getting a varkid to the Ultimate stage can be a major upheaval in solo mode. Teams of four (or those playing in 4-player mode) would likely be better off choosing one of the two above areas, as the odds of getting multiple Ultimate Badasses in a single location are fairly good.

**5. And how do I force him to spawn?**

Here's the tricky part. You can't really ""force"" him to spawn. When a varkid first spawns

In order to evolve

* Need to be shot. Shooting them *is* a good way to keep them focused on you
* Need to have allies present. More varkids obviously means more chances to evolve, the ""family tree"" idea that having X amount of varkids at a particular evolution level will *guarantee* that at least one of them evolves is nonsense.

Varkids DO:

* Need to be combat-active. That's it. As long as you keep them distracted (i.e. they're showing up on your minimap as a red dot), given enough time. This will happen regardless of what you do, provided you (a) keep them in combat, and (b) don't kill them.

**6. How do I know if a varkid is at its evolutionary limit?**

Varkids have a reliable timer you can use before deciding whether or not to kill them. 

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| :-- | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| **Varkid level** | Larval | Adult | Badass | Super | Ultimate |
| **Time to pod (seconds)** | 10 | 20 | 30 | 60 | 120 |

Any varkid that hasn't built its pod within this time limit can be safely killed. These timers start when the varkid becomes combat-active. The timers will start over from 0 if the varkid leaves combat, it's quicker to just cut your losses, quit to the main menu, and try again.

**7. So what do I need to kill him?**

First off, but that's all). All varkids, except badasses, are vulnerable to fire damage, so a couple good fire weapons are necessary. You'll want a powerful corrosive weapon to deal with the Badasses. Moxxi's weapons are ideal due to their healing factor. An Adaptive shield will help keep you alive longer, and The Bee will help take down the more powerful forms, provided you can stay in cover. You should avoid Nova and Spike shields, you should avoid using skills that can passively harm your enemies, is useful in making sure varkids keep attacking you

If you're lucky enough to find an Infinity with a caustic element effect, and the Badasses are usually the ones closest to you when you do, so not needing to reload can quite literally be a life-saver).

**8. I'm on console and I'm playing solo / not in a party of 4. Is there any way to increase the odds of Vermivorous showing up?**

There is, without even needing to pay the Eridium toll (walk by the vendors by Hyperius's gate in Washburne Refinery; walking up against the gate in Hayter's Folly and getting the Gee's Arena text to show up will also activate 4-player mode). An easy way to tell if you've done it correctly is by mass-picking up ammo: if you're picking up ammo even if you're already full, you're in 4-player mode. Of course this trick works on PC as well, but PC players also have access to the difficulty sliders.

Let's take a look at the most recent update - we got a level cap increase to 61, more inventory space, and several significant bug fixes. The level cap increase has been something that we've been clamoring about for MONTHS. We're now allowed to go up to 61, which is an excellent number in that we can unlock two capstones. The third playthrough is already being lauded on this subreddit as challenging and fresh, especially with the buff to Slag in PT3. The new gear is crazy, and is actually easier to get (at least farming Legendary Loot Midgets is more effort than the Evil Smasher glitch).

Speaking of which, and has responded to them excellently. As if that weren't enough, we're getting *a sixth Vault Hunter* in just a few months (about the time when people have thoroughly explored all the new material) and another DLC which is promised to be the biggest yet.

I'm not suggesting that we ignore bugs, but instead that we gain some perspective. I, for one, was not expecting how much new content would actually come out, and think that we should show some appreciation to Gearbox. They've done a great job handling the hundreds of suggestions and complaints from the community, and we should keep that in mind before continuing to give feedback on the new material.

Very simply, it makes sense to allow the players to change them for a price.

Maybe they would want to avoid the changing accessories, and you shouldn't have to farm it again.

This doesn't even necessarily mean that everyone would just end up with the same gun.  I know, but I personally prefer the Close Quarters Hornet on my Zero (I also have a Twin).  It reloads faster, has better accuracy to let me use it from longer range, and the melee bonus is useful.  It fits my playstyle more.

2. The new white to purple rarirty system. Previously, rarity just determines the material, and a better material is a fixed boost to every stat. Overall, this means that a purple weapon is always better than an equivalent blue, blue is always better than green, ect. 

3. Not really a downgrade but more a shortfall of one of the upgrades. Explosive bonus damage isn't listed in the same way elemental bonus damage is.

4. Bank and backpack storage is now more limited. What am I supposed to do with my 87 bazillion guns? If the data is stored clientside

5. Again

6. UI for the inventory is worse

7. EDIT: The class mod appearances are, center side and right side parts, with thousands of combinations of appearance and textures.

It may seem like I really hate the new weapon generation system. I don't. I just feel that while they have gone 2 steps forwards

People complained that the only differences between weapons in BL1 were all very tiny, the only changes are massive fundamental differences in the weapons, but this means that the number of weapons actually possible has decreased greatly. The best system would combine the massive differences (getting shotguns you can lob like grenades and have quadruple barrels) with the subtle variations (It also has a stock that increases accuracy slightly at the cost of some damage).",,False,self,t5_2r8cd,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/113h31/while_there_have_been_many_improvements_between/

Many of the bosses in the game have completely unavoidable attacks. Terramorphous is notorious for his super stretchy tentacle smacks that either almost kill you or knock you off the edge.

The new raid bosses also have this. At least the first one does.

No matter what you do

Now you're probably thinking ""Stop moaning it's good that he's hard!""

I'm not moaning

Let's take an example from Dark Souls. Extremely hard game

The way I see it

In the example of one of the new bosses, because you still get hit either way.

You should instead take more damage the closer you are to him.

[Asha

The basis of the class is simple. It is a literal pet class. I know we technically have one already with Gaige

Each tree focuses on one aspect of the class, and the *One for All* tree gives buffs to your entire party. I tried to use all the existing in game skills of our six existing characters to balance things out, but some things may still be a little under/over powered.

I really wanted the pet to be a very heavy focus, I thought that it would make sense for small arms fire to be more prevalent than her carrying around a rocket launcher bigger than herself. 

Originally there was also an extensive back story and a set of class mods for this post as well, I can get those finished and post them up here as well.

1368640679.0,1ee990,[Updated for Krieg] How skills actually work and things not mentioned in the tooltip.,Zikel,393,57,61,"General combat

* Kill skills last **7 seconds**

* Melee attacks crit for **2x** damage and none of the critical hit damage bonuses change that.

* The melee damage bonus % found on weapons is multiplicative rather than additive.
____
***Krieg***
____

Krieg has higher default melee damage then everyone else.

**He has a X% increased melee damage** that works exactly the same way as a bayonet attachment and occupies the same slot.

That % increase scales with level.  **lvl 20: 13% | level 44: 50% | level 61: 77

**So after level 44 if you equip a weapon with a blade attachment that gives you 50% increased melee damage you would actually do LESS damage** than if you were using weapon with no blade attachment.
But if you equip the Law (100% increased melee damage) you will be doing higher melee damage.
____

* **Buzz Axe Rampage**

Base cooldown: 120 seconds. **Duration 16 seconds** 

Melee damage bonus is **multiplicative**.

The cooldown is reduced **by 1 second for every 3.5% of his BASE health lost**.

This cooldown reduction is 4 times less effective if the damage is done to his shields instead of his health.

This also works with self inflicted damage.

It is irrelevant what weapon you have in hand when you activate this skill.

_____
***Mania***

* **Pull the Pin**

This activates when you die

If you kill an enemy with it you will be notified when you respown.

Longbow grenades do not teleport

* **Salt the Wound**

You constantly lose 1 stack per second.

_____
***Hellborn***

Default self ignition duration: 5 seconds.

* **Elemental Elation**

**You can gain no more than 1 stack per second.**

You start losing stacks after 2 seconds of not doing elemental dot damage and you lose 2 stacks per second.

* **Fire Fiend**

Axes thrown in Buzz Axe Rampage are on fire and can set enemies on fire.

_____
***Bloodlust***

Elemental Status Effect Damage grants stacks of Bloodlust

By default you start losing stacks after 1 second of not dealing damage.

The rate of decay varies

It takes 46 seconds to go from 100 to 0 stacks.


* **Buzz Axe Bombardier**

Does an additional 100% of the base damage of an thrown Axe as explosive damage.

 The damage of the explosion is not affected by melee damage bonuses but it is affected by explosive damage bonuses.

The explosion can easily damage multiple enemies and it's triggered when the axe hits any surface.

____
***Zero***
____

* **Deception** 

Action Skill. Press button to create a holographic decoy and vanish for a few seconds**(6 seconds)**. 

The longer you are invisible the more Damage your next attack deals

**A minimum of  230%** up to +650% Melee Damage

**A minimum of 40%** Up to +200% Gun Damage

~~Up to +250% Gun Critical Hit Damage~~

Lies. **Deception does not give any Critical him damage increase** at all
I think this text it there to remind you that maybe you should try to land a critical hit with the deception damage bonus.

_____
***Bloodshed***

* **Killing blow**

 **""low on health""** ? - When below **30% health**.

The damage bonus from this skill is multiplicative rather than additive

* **Execute**

How much exactly is this **""massive damage""** ?

This skill changes the melee damage bonus of deception from 

A minimum of 230% up to 650% Melee damage to

**A minimum of 460% up to 1400% increased Melee damage**

* **Many must fall**

Fully refreshes Death blossom every time you succeed.

**+ 2 seconds** on the duration of deception per kill.
_____

***Cunning***

* **Counter Strike**

It is activated by any enemy attack that is not damage over time.

* **Ambush**

You get the bonus if enemies are targeting your decoy

* **Unforeseen**

Additional decoys can be created by **Many must fall explode**

* **Death Mark**

The damage bonus is **multiplicative.**

* **Death Blossom**

You throw 4 daggers at a time and you can do that 5 times. They can have any of the 5 elemental types. 

To apply **Death mark** you have to directly hit an enemy

___
***Sniping***

* **Kill Confirmed**

It takes **~ 2.7 seconds** to get the full bonus.

* **Critical Ascension**

You start losing stacks after **6 seconds.**

You lose 1 stack Per second.

Switching weapon, quest log, etc), using a vending machine, talking to a quest giver and dieing instantly removes all stacks.

___

***Gaige***
___

* **Summon Deathtrap**

60 seconds cooldown
___
***Ordered Chaos***

* **Robot Rampage**

**Cooldown - 13 seconds.**

Misleading tooltip. It's not 7 attacks

DT spins for 2 seconds dealing 9 attacks to all enemies near him. Each of those 9 attacks does 62% of his normal melee attack damage.At the end of his spin he does an instant normal attack with no delay for full damage.

In other words

* **Discord**

Cost - **1.33 stacks per second.**

* **Death from Above**

Cooldown - 2 seconds.

Shooting while walking on uneven surfaces or getting hit by bullets and getting lifting inches off the ground can result  in unwanted activaton of this skill. 

* **The Nth Degree**

**Do NOT invest more than one point in this skill.**

In the best case scenario (if there are always enemies in range) you will get 11.1% damage increase from 1 point in this skill. 
Investing 4 more skill points you will only increase that bonus to 20%. 

Because of this investing more than 1 is a waste of skill points.

* **With Claws**

At the cost of 1 Anarchy stack you do 2 swipes

At 1% heath this skill heals for up to ~**30%** of your heath per swipe. At 90% health it will heal for ~5% of your health.

Also important to note is that because of both swipes do full melee damage and the speed at which you can use this attack this skill effectively gives you **50%  increased melee attack speed.**

___
***Little Big Trouble***

* **The Stare**

**Cooldown - 15 seconds.**

Damage not affected by Evil Enchantress or badass rank bonuses.

* **Shock Storm**

Can activate Electrical burn even if created by Deathtrap.

* **One Two Boom**

**Cooldown - 42 seconds.**

* **Interspersed Outburst**

First stack after **2 seconds** of not shooting.

Full stacks after **9.3 seconds** of not shooting.

**The damage is based on character level and the number of stacks only.** It will do the same damage with 1 or 5 points invested.
**The chance to slag is 2% per rank for each stack.** So with 5 stacks at rank 5 the chance to slag is 50%.

***Make It Sparkle***

Each of his melee attacks does additional damage equal to **2x** his base melee damage.

Because it takes the base damage and not the actual damage Strength of 5 Gorillas

The elemental damage he does is also affected by the elemental damage type multipliers. So for example if Deathtrap does 1000 damage with his melee attacks and you set him on fire and send him after a fleshy target

**But there is more

This is because it does the full bonus elemental damage on each attack.

Let me toss some numbers at you.

At level 61 Deathtrap does 136k damage with his melee attack. If I send him with no upgrades vs a Super Badass Loader he will do 272k damage in 2 seconds.

If he has Make it Sparkle and Robot Rampage and I you give him corrosive attacks he will do:

895k damage normal damage + 3133k corrosive damage in 2 seconds.

**So from 272k to 4027k damage.**

And if you slag that enemy for him
___
***Best Friends Forever***

* **Buck Up**

**Cooldown - 18 seconds.**

* **Explosive Clap**

**Cooldown - 25 seconds.**

* **Sharing is Caring**

Deathtrap does not benefit from the special effect of Amp Shields.

Spike

Absorb shields do not give you ammo

Don't have a way of testing if Turtle shields reduce his heath or do adaptive shields boost his health and resistances.

___

***Maya***
___
* **Phaselock**

By default it lasts **5 seconds**
___
***Cataclysm***

* **Flicker**

It increases the chance to apply an elemental effect that the weapon has by said %.

(example

* **Helios**

It also applies on targets that cannot be Phaselocked.

* **Ruin**

It creates 3  explosions with the center being the phaselocked target. Slag

___
***Harmony***

* **Life tap**

Instantly restores health equal to x% of any damage you do. Works with  guns, melee attacks, damage over time effects, any damage you do.

* **Scorn**

Sends out a slow moving orb that explodes on impact doing minor slag damage. While flying the orb also sends out slag tendrils to all enemies around it

Very reliable  way of applying slag to multiple enemies.

___
***Motion***

* **Kinetic Reflection**

You can become immune to bullets if I have 10 points in to this skill ?

* **Sub-Sequence**

Once the phaselocked target dies the spell starts moving the same way homing grenades do and seeks another target.

While the spell is moving to another target the duration of phaselock keeps going down. Also when its seeking another target Wreck

Every time it hits a new target Converge

* **Thoughtlock**

Converge,Ruin, Chain reaction and Elated work with Thoughtlock.

___
***Salvador***
___

* **Gunzerking**

By default this skill lasts 20 seconds and provides 33.3% damage reduction.

___
***Brawn***

* **I'm the Juggernaut**

At 5 points the 20% damage reduction you are supposed to get is more like ~16.5%. It's a great skill nonetheless.

When combined with **Gunzerking** it results in 41% damage reduction.

* **Fistful of Hurt**

**300%** increased melee damage (multiplicative).

* **Come At Me Bro**

The buff lasts **8 seconds** and it increases the damage reduction to **66.6%**. 

When combined with **I'm the Juggernaut**(5 points) it results in  ~ 71% damage reduction.

___
***Rampage***


* **Get Some**

It is important to note that this skill also works while you are **Gunzerking**


* **Keep Firing...**

You just have to keep your finger on the triggers

It takes about 10 seconds to get the maximum bonuses.

____
***Gun Lust***

* **All I Need is One**

Best thing about this skill is that it works with rocket launchers.

* **Money Shot**

Does not work with Rocket Launchers. 

No all that great when using TORGUE weapons because of the way explosive weapon damage is calculated.

With 5 points in the skill the damage bonus for **clip size** is as follows:

1 = 0% (You sttil hear the sound

2 = 80%

3 = 120%

4 = 160%

5 = 200%

6 = 240%

7 = 280%

8 = 320%

9 = 360%

10 = 400%

**11 = 440%!**

**12+ = 480%!**

Yes


* **No Kill Like Overkill**

How does it work ?

It works exactly as it says

The cap is 5x as much damage as you would do with no overkill bonus. That damage bonus is multiplicative and is applied at the end of the equation.

Whatever damage you can do without the overkill bonus you can do up to 5 times as much damage with the overkill bonus

For example if you can hit a slagged target for 100k damage with the bonus from ""All I need is one"" and ""Money Shot"" and no Overkill bonus

___
***Axton***
___

* **Sabre Turret**

How long does it last by default ?

23 seconds

___

***Gunpowder***

* **Steady**

This skill states that it increases grenade damage

* **Do or die**

Same thing as **Steady.**

* **Battlefront** 

Same as the two above

* **Nuke**

Not affected by any damage bonuses other then the slag and Death Mark damage multipliers.

____
***Guerrilla***

* **Scorched Earth**

Equipping your turret with rocked pods also decreases the damage the gun of the turret does by **13%**
 
* **Double Up**

This upgrade also decreases the turret gun damage by **13%**. This results in a **74%** increased damage  for having 2 guns rather than the 100% increase that you would expect. 

If you combine this with rocket pods then you will be only getting **54%** increased turret gun damage.

All of that does not mean that rocket pods are not worth it.

 **HEY! MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!**



Spoilers starting here! 
Don't read! Seriously! Spoilers coming up!


**SNAPE KILLS DUMBLEDORE**

So I'd just like to start some discussion about the various lore questions that are left with us after completing Borderlands 2

**Why doesn't Jack stop you from respawning?**

There are many reasons for this. The first is obviously that he needs you to reach sanctuary
Secondly

""I hope this didn't hurt too much. Think of me like a safety net. I took the liberty to uploading your DNA to a new-u station here on Pandora. Not everyone on the planet can afford this luxury

This means she can control the new-u station (like she can control most systems on Pandora)

Finally

So that accounts for why you still respawn. At first, and finally, Jack who wants to kill you himself.

Diving into the unused audio some more also reveals some funny lines

""This is hillarious! I own the machine that just respawned you, or is that one of those thing you think is ironic but actually isn't? Like a cripple doing standup? I don't know.""

""OH MY GAHD! HAhaaha! There goes again

""I'm considering going 'Ka-ching' right now but that would be really immature, I could cure universal hunger. But no, that money was better spent reviving you.""

""KA-CHING! Crap

""All this dying you're doing

He has a few more lines about how hilarious it is that you are dying. He also eat pretzels.
So going from this, check.

This also takes out the mystery of why Roland actually dies. Angel probably protected them (perhaps)


**Why are everyone so afraid of Wilhelm

I haven't heard this in-game

""Shame that Wilhelm had to let you kill him. Heck of a soldier -- not many people would volunteer to die

""So, that's cause I poisoned him before you guys fought. Worth it, though, to make you think I didn't want you to have that power core. But -- psst -- spoilers: I did.""

So yeah


**Is Captain Flynt related to Baron Flynt?**

In an (unused?) audio

""I'm still offering a reward for whoever brings me the head of the man or woman who murdered my brother


**Why does not Jack Respawn after you killing him?**

I have no idea. Anyone?

If anyone has some lore they have stumbled over,False,self,t5_2r8cd,1350227568.0,,maya,t3_11dxbt
1362388039.0,19mp2z,I don't want to fight one corporation in BL3. I want to fight all of them! (and other thoughts),Imploder,395,70,104,"I've had all sorts of ideas about BL3. And I've shared a few of them in some comment threads. This is a wishful fan theory of mine

The main thing I would like to see introduced into BL3 is choice. While BL is a fairly open world, he travels to The Friendship Gulag and you have to save him there instead of at the Ramparts. Otherwise, its a pretty straight forward experience. 

So lets talk for a second about where we're at after the end of BL2. 

**MAJOR SPOILER ALERT**

Its discovered that there are lots of other Vaults in the universe. Roland

So here we go: Jack is dead, the other Corporations take notice. 

Now we know that there can only be six Sirens in the universe at a time. We know of four of the six (Lillith, and two unaccounted for. 

An arms race has begun. All of the corporations want their own Siren. And with two young ones out their in the universe, the thought of another corporation gaining the kind of power Hyperion was able to achieve doesn't sit well with them. Lillith and Maya set out to find these young girls before the other corporations can. Fighting them all along the way. In various environments and locals (different planets... SPACE!). That takes the fight off Pandora and makes the BL universe an even bigger place. Each corporation has its own champion that will eventually be a boss. You could have a lot of fun with this. The Jacobs boss could be a grizzled gun slinger. Vladoff could have a massive Russian brawler covered in gatling guns. Tedior could have a fast moving teleporting ninja. Maliwan could have one of the two Sirens yet unaccounted for with crazy elemental powers. Dahl could have a... well screw Dahl... Nobody likes Dahl. Someone else can come up with that one.

Meanwhile... Two kindred spirits have found each other. Sal and Brick have struck up quite the friendship. They're best buds and heterosexual life partners. And having a similar mindset, they aren't exactly considerate. They arrive on Vault planets like a swarm of locusts. With reckless abandon, they consume the resources of nearby settlements, and though they discourage their Slabs from harming the locals, Sal and Brick aren't the best at policing them. If they see a slab acting out of line in front of them, they have no reservations in killing him right there on the spot and apologizing to the victim. But the Slabs wise up and just do their bad stuff when Sal and Brick aren't around. 

Now we're at Axton, but untimely they need this to stop. This can't go on. Its out of control and innocents are dying. They are stuck in a difficult position. These are their friends, but that bond is slowly wearing thin and will soon dissolve. They are forced to make a hard choice. They need to end this in whatever way they can. They have to stop the Slabs, the Sirens, the Corporations. Their task is overwhelming. Resources are extremely limited. And their opponents are vast in number and power. The scariest of which is becoming the Sirens. They seem to be losing touch with reality. Their search for these missing Sirens is driving them into a focused frenzy and they seem to be losing their regard for human life. Placing the lives of a couple of Sirens before those of the rest of humanity. And their powers seem to have increased exponentially as the Slabs open more and more Vaults. 

Now... there is one wild card here. Zer0. He has no more interest in Vault Hunting. Been there

Here's where the player comes in. You choose. You pick your side. And your path will cross with all the other opposing factions. There is a certain moral grey area in each group. And its all self perpetuating. While the Slabs seem like they are only doing bad, they are preventing another company from becoming the next Hyperion. And while Axton, Gaige and Mord seem to be doing the most good, they are actually assisting the corporations (the old enemy of my enemy idiom). You could even go so far as to say the only one with any real solution to end all of this pain, suffering and war is Zer0. 

Who's team are you on? 

I haven't put much thought to the best way the player should be injected into all of this. A new set of Vault Hunters? Can you even call them Vault Hunters anymore? Or do you get to play all of the old characters, updated and upgraded new abilities. 

Which ever side you end up on, different endings. And a butt load of replayability. And more than anything else, it will up the ante. Which seems to be the name of the game when it comes to BL. 

ANNNNNNNDDDD... I'm spent. Thanks for reading! Feels good to finally get that out. 

Edit: Wow. Holy crap. Posted this right before bed. Just woke up. Reading through everyone's comments. And you guys have made your case

1350250663.0,11h8u0,An idea I had for Eridium...,Snuffz,410,87,95,"So everyone wants another use for Eridium...

And everyone hates how hard it is to spawn Vermivorous... (Completely luck based and the drops suck

So...

Sir Hammerlock contacts you with a breakthrough. He says he needs to you come to him with X amount of Eridium (Lets say... 70 to make it hard to obtain).

When you get there he explains how he's been researching the data from the Mutated Varkid side-quest you do ~20

Of course he wants you to kill it

Inject it into a pod and the pod will grow bigger and bigger until Vermi spawns. After the quest he offers to make you more for the same cost.

Quest could be called something like:

**You. Will. Die. (No

And will only be able to be obtained after killing Terramorphous.

This keeps it in line with the other boss quests like Tannis giving you the Terra quest

Thoughts?

Let me first say that the red text description on [this](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Special_Weapon_Effects_Bordelands_2#Combat_Rifles) page is very inaccurate. This gun's effect is very unique: on reload

First off, I'm going to provide you with the magazine size and damage increases. I'm going to use my current Evil Smasher to give you some stats:

My (level 25) Evil Smasher's mag size is 8 and its damage is 238. Remember

Using Marcus' firing range dummy

The lowest my magazine can be after triggering this effect is 31. Now, accuracy recovery, fire rate, and recoil reduction in incredible amounts.

The next mag size is 54. A shot to the body deals **10553** and a critical hit deals **14319**. At this point the crosshairs recover from firing almost instantly.

Next we have a 77 bullet magazine. A body shot deals **15419** and a critical hit deals **20921**. 

Next is a 100 bullet magazine (this isn't even the highest!). A body shot now deals **20286** and a critical deals **27523**. Crosshairs are almost touching and fire rate is impeccable. Step aside Bee. 

Now we are greeted with a 123 bullet mag. A body shot now deals **25152** damage and a critical hit deals **34126**. This is with a gun with 238 base damage!

Finally, but here are the numbers. A body shot deals **30018** and a critical hit deals **40728**. **Smokin' Jesus titty cinnamon.**

You must be thinking ""where has this gun been all my life"". Well, swapping back to the Evil Smasher will drop you down a tier of stat increases). You can be getting even greater numbers than this **at level 25** **with all of your guns**. In fact, after you use the effect once, you don't even need the Evil Smasher equipped to use this effect. GG Evil Smasher. This effect can have so many applications, whether it be combined with The Bee for massive damage or increasing your Baby Maker's magazine size to 100+.

1374547027.0,1iuwuv,New character idea: PAL-D1N prototype defensive robot.,willyolio,386,82,78,"Backstory: A prototype robot created by the Anshin corporation.  Anshin realized that defensive equipment are not as lucrative as offensive equipment; however

Basic role: I've found that there are no characters that truly have any shield specialties.  Sure, Zer0 = melee/sniping/stealth, krieg = melee/explosives/grenades, Maya = elemental/disabling/healing, Gaige = wildcard/pure damage.  That's a pretty wide variety there, but nothing that really involves shields... so here's PAL-D1N.

Full name: Prototype Anshin Learning bot - Defensive/mk. 1/Revision N
- 

Other characteristics:

- Slightly taller than Salvador
- ""heavy"" (i.e. high inertia like Krieg)
- YELLOW health bar (armoured).  Still affected normally by healing skills and such.  Less health than average.

Action Skill: Overshield
-
- works like the ION Loader's shield: when deployed, your equipped shield will recharge to 100%.

Skill tree 1 focuses on boosting the Overshield's capabilities.  Sample skills:

- Increase the Overshield's regeneration rate but decreases capacity (e.g. 10%/-2% per level)
- increase the Overshield's radius (20% per level)
- Deploying the overshield now knocks back and stuns enemies (1 point)
- Adds continuous electric and fire damage inside the shield (rank 1-5)
- PAL-D1N now continuously ejects explosive/corrosive balls that bounce around inside the overshield while it's active (rank 1-5)
- enemy projectiles hitting the shield (from inside or outside) are redirected towards enemies.  (+20% chance/+60% damage per level)
- Friendly projectiles passing through the shield gain slag damage
- damaging enemies with shields recharges the overshield even faster
- Allies inside the overshield get (+20%/level) of the overshield's recharge rate
- kills made inside the overshield extend overshield's duration
- **capstone skill**: +200% recharge rate.  No maximum capacity (skills/mods/relics that affect capacity only determine capacity at activation).  All of the overshield's offensive capabilities have their damage boosted equal to the overshield's current capacity (e.g. 140% capacity = +140% damage)

Skill Tree 2 focuses on boosting your equipped shield's capabilities + Capacitor stacking.

- **Capacitor Stacking**: when your shield reaches maximum capacity, max stacks +10/level.  Each stack boosts damage resistance by 1% and health regeneration by 0.1%.  You lose stacks if your shield has **not** been at maximum capacity for several seconds.  The Overshield gains benefits from cap stacks.  The action skill will very easily boost you up a few dozen stacks, by the way.

- increase special effect damage (nova, and amp shields, +1%/level/cap stack)
- shield steal- damaging enemies recharges your shields as a % of damage dealt.  Will add to capacitor stacking if you're already at full shields.  Dealing damage to enemy shields doubles the bonus.
- increase special effect percentages (adaptive, +2%/level/cap stack.  note: this multiplies, not adds.  Absorb shields over 100% may give you multiple bullets)
- Allows shields to **overcharge** by +5%/level
- Allows Absorb/Adaptive/Spike/Booster shields to continue operating when depleted
- Increase delay before cap stacks disappear
- Allies inside the overshield gain Cap Stack bonuses
- Cap stacks add to cooldown recharge speed (+0.2%/level/stack)
- cap stacks increase the Overshield's recharge rate (+1%/level/stack)
- **Capstone skill**: allows you to take up one weapon slot and equip a second shield.  Capacity and recharge rates are added.  Special effects operate independently (e.g. 2 spike shields will both produce their own spike damages).  Recharge delay is averaged.

Skill tree 3 is more directly offensive capabilities.  Probably something with a robot theme.  I haven't really thought about it much yet.  One idea is that it's a ""learning"" robot- Anshin intended for it to go out, it could have a ""learning stack"" mechanism that increases stacks as long as you keep using the same manufacturer weapons and improve performance that way.  Unfortunately, it's still a prototype/incomplete, so it keeps losing all previous data when you switch weapons =P

You guys have given me one of the best thrill rides I've had in a game, even in life in general. So you guys should know how much you mean to me and all of the fine gamers on this subreddit and across the world. I say this because, in all of the controversy with the level cap and second season that's arriving with your announcement, I wanted to send a message from the most valuable people you know: your community. I know you may never see this. This could get downvoted to shit. But i don't care. Because the community i see on this subreddit are dedicated to making a masterpiece of gaming art even greater. I've spent 300 some hours on just borderlands 2 alone. I have the ultimate loot chest and the limited edition guide. i have posters and artwork all over the place. And it's all because you guys had an idea. An idea of a planet filled with Bandits and mystery and loot. So i can honestly say with confidence that i am now and forever a vault hunter. I can't thank you enough for enticing and exciting me like you have these past years, and i ask, if you even see this, that you keep your heads up. look on to the future of pandora. Your community will support you no matter what you do. Because it's not just about the loot or the prizes anymore. It's about the experience. You guys are damn good at what you do. keep it up.

Among the level cap increase and various other changes coming to Borderlands 2 on April 2

Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode differs quite a bit from Normal Mode and True Vault Hunter Mode -- here's a quick rundown of the major changes:

Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode Details

Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode is unlocked for a character once they have completed the main story missions in True Vault Hunter Mode and reached level 50.

Unlike other playthroughs

No more tutorial missions -- characters in Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode begin in Southern Shelf with the ""Cleaning Up the Berg"" mission.

While playing in Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode, the highest-level player in that party.

Gameplay changes in UVHM:
Enemy health generally increased 4x.
Enemies now have a moderate amount of health regeneration.
Increased duration of slag damage multiplier effect.
Upped the damage that slagged enemies take from 2x to 3x.
Weapon swap speed increased to better facilitate slag use.
Enemies now more likely to drop ammo.
Loot Midgets are now ""Legendary Loot Midgets"" that can drop Legendary and other top-tier gear.

Check back Monday for details on the various bug fixes in Tuesday's update, arrives in May with the fourth campaign add-on (included in the Season Pass) hitting by the end of June!

I'd call it Fallen Angels. 

Upon the death of Roland and returning to Sanctuary there would be an additional ECHO recorder and a quest from Brick/Mordecai.  The ECHO would be left from Angel and say something along the lines of ""if you are hearing this then it means I am free..."" it goes on to outline how Jack's Moonbase's main uplink from Pandora is the converted old Crimson Fastness, etc)

You get there, you are scrambled and lost, you come to in a black room with almost no lights and a single button.

You push it, specifically on the Moonbase in an observation room overlooking Pandora.  You get to see Pandora for about 15 seconds as the blast doors slowly open.  THEN THEY SLAM SHUT AGAIN.

A wicked AI voice

You get out and continue to explore the moonbase.

You learn through voice over that Dark Angle is an AI

The moonbase is designed opposite of Pandora.  No trash.  Everything is sleek and clean.  Lots of plastic and glass.  No curved angles

All the Loaders are there.  Also there is a biological race of somewhat amorphous beings.  They are self powering and can meld with mechenery.  So if you disable or destroy a loader, and then use it to kick your ass, with the abilities of the loader, they can do this multiple times.  Think how the Goliaths power up, only gaining the traits of the Loaders they kill.

One of the zones is a shrine

One of the amorphous creatures (call them ""Noans"" from ""Noare"") is friendly

You return it to the Noan and with his help you resurrect Angel as a Cyborg.  At this point you have unlocked Angel as a new Playable Character for the game.  ""Fallen Angel"".  Her body is half cybernetic, depending on space) and rail plasma on the field.  Some upgrades include the ability to take on abilities from defeated Loaders (similar to the Noans), chain the plasma so that when it hits an enemy it jumps from one to the next doing damage, and electrical elemental damage with perks such as ""stun"" which cause electrocuted enemies to be shocked and not able to move or attack while under the effect.

This pissed Dark Angel off to the extreme and she goes on full assault.  You are forced to retreat back into the moonbase and areas you passed through originally are now active, it is a ship, a battleship, and you are inside it.  With Angel's help you fight your way to the reactor core of the moonbase, and in the climax of the DLC you Fight off an enhanced Dark Angel while the other Angel ""plugs in"" to the core to overload it with her own power.  

The place explodes with everyone on it and starts crashing down.  You get a short playable sequence where you have to run and jump from debris to debris as it is in the air falling to the ground.  You have to get to Angel and reach her before impact.  At which point Angel creates a stasis field that saves you two (and the Noan) from death.

That is the end of the DLC, and Fallen Angel is a playable character.


Also you could let the Noan mod your weapons for you

Obviously I haven't thought it all the way out

With Rubi, badass ranks, and any other multiplier. So if you see a 160K after a shot, you get 20,160 health regenerated. 

But here's the best part. This includes the elemental damage

The best combination, sense it technically counts as elemental damage. So if i'm dual wielding a rubi and unkempt harold, i can do some serious damage and get some serious health regeneration.

Nope = http://www.bl2wiki.com/Class_mods. He clearly has ""Succinct Professional Title (what I use) which gives reload/shield capacity +3 listed skills. His spec? http://www.bl2db.com/skill-trees#zzVVoV0VVVb0xVM. Yea buddy. Your spec tree ""was a complete mess."" Yea.... messed with mods.

Second: Wat? He has all the tier buffs? Wait! Don't you need at least 1 point to activate the bonuses from items? C0unter-strike = 0 points/ Unf0rseen = 0 points/Like the Wind - 0 points/ Be like Water = 0 points. He must be Paragon level 100!

Third: Run Like Water buff... This requires 26 (TWENTY-SIX) talent points to get by ITSELF. Yea. Let that sink in

Fourth: He has Tw0-Fang (See: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPIhZQPQUec&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=244s). Which again... takes 26 (TWENTY-SIX) talent points by itself to get. 

Fifth: He has all 3 (THREE) kill skills active WHILE getting almost top tier talents. Requires about 94 talent points. Damn those Paragon levels!

Sixth: Lots of modders out there trying to make a name for themself.  ",self,t5_2r8cd,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/10cypo/how_to_spot_a_cheaters_terramorphous_zer0_solo/

One could just chalk it up to the 'dumb muscle' archetype, that's probably what the developers were going for with Sledge. However, they have set up (at least, from what I am reading in the wiki) that after 'something' was found at the headstone mine, people were starting to become heavily mutated. Which, makes sense: the whole point of the Headstone mine was to dig out, hopefully, and people started to mutate

Then, which is described as a 'precious alien element' started popping up in every which place all over Pandora.

I was torn between two class types; an android/robot like character, but hoping that one day I could submit it to Gearbox and, even if it didn't become an actual character, could use it to prove that I could be a credit to their team. 

When the Borderlands team announced a month or so ago that they were going to announce a new character, and all of my work will be for nothing."" He told me I should finish it quickly and post it online before the new character was announced, just in case it WAS a psycho, and then I wouldn't be accused of just stealing their character idea and lacking creativity. 

I stalled

I know that if I'd finished my character before the announcement it wouldn't have changed anything; they've probably been working on this character since the game came out. But still, but because of my inexperience I didn't get that chance. 

The character has been common knowledge for a few days(?) now, I stalled getting my ideas on paper, and most of them were lost in the chaos I call my brain), and is VERY different from Krieg, but hopefully you all will still like it all the same.

UVHM is dull. Gameplay-wise, that's not something new. However, in BL2, the difficulty jump is so extensive that you're basically shoehorned into using slag. This is clunky, inconvenient, and restricts your weapon choice and playstyle so much. In a game which uses randomly generated loot like Borderlands, you shouldn't be struggling to take enemies down with max level gear. However
  
Before you get out your torches and pitchforks in protest, and rewarded those who did. In UVHM, it works in reverse: players who try different playstyles suffer more, and those who don't use slag are punished. The weakest enemies survive a Norfleet shot to the face. There's a challenge, and then there's this, which feels like much more artificial difficulty.  
  
It feels like Gearbox is trying to push players to online multiplayer, slag dependence). Personally, I don't play online, but that's not what this thread is about. I'm more concerned about what cumbersome gameplay mechanics will be thrown at us next under the guise of difficulty.

One complaint that I've heard a lot on here is that the DLCs feel like they're too short

I think content-wise

Back in Dr. Ned and Knoxx's Armory (only 2 I played), you had to spend a pretty good amount of time to get there. If you were headed out to Lockdown Palace you:

Spawned in T-Bone Junction.

Got in a car.

Traveled to the Map exit

Drove down the Crimson Tollway

Stopped at a blocked area

Came back up to the top of the highway

Fought through a tough Mech in the tunnel

Got back in a car

Drove to the map exit

...The list goes on. It used to take me a good 20 minutes of fighting and travelling for me to get from T-Bone Junction to Lockdown Palace.

But now each area in the DLC has its own fast travel station, and you had to run/boat/fight all the way to claptrap, *every time?* Hell, I get bored when I spawn at the Oasis FT machine and have to run to the Treasure room. When you start Torgue, its about 5 Minutes of walk/drive/fight until you get to the dome.

I think if the use of FT stations was the same in each game,False,self,t5_2r8cd,False,,zero,t3_178ai3

1352151250.0,12otpw,Why gun exploration was so much more fun in BL1 than BL2,Auto-Brad,371,139,168,"Lets preface by saying

First of all

Second off

In BL1 everyone had their favorite type(s) of weapon (pistol, the game even assisted at this by having a lot of weapon specific skills (which is a discussion for another day). In my experience people liked 2 or 3 different types of weapons and always gravitated toward those. So... this means that every time a chest was opened (which was a lot more in BL1) there was a 2/7 or 3/7 chance that it was going to be a gun worth looking at and comparing. In my opinon that was one of the most rewarding things, finding a new gun to replace your old one, and trying it out. Now you are probably asking ""what has changed??""

Weapon manufacturers my friends. Just like I mentioned before, torgue ARs). So basically there is now a 2/7 or 3/7 chance that the chest you open in BL2 will have the gun type you want and then another 1/3 or 1/4 chance that it will be in the manufacturer that you want. And if its not... you don't even bother looking at its stats. 

This is a huge flaw because i found that as I leveled up my characters in BL2 it was rare to find minute stat increases for my favorite guns instead I would be using the same level 19 gun until level 23 when I happened to find another one similar to replace it. This also meant that it would be more and more difficult killing enemies until you found the level 23 gun. 

I really wanted to enjoy BL2 more than BL1 and every time I play BL2 I keep telling myself,,False,self,t5_2r8cd,False,,True

**Unforgiven:**

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=136292953

Pistol

Jakobs

76988 Damage

98.6 Accuracy

2.4 Fire Rate

2.1 Reload Speed

8 Round Clip

""It's a helluva thing...""

It seems to not stop at walls, it does a HUGE amount of damage, even compared to other level 61 Pearl weapons. **EDIT:**  a nice man just told me that the Trick Shot prefix is what is causing the bouncing bullets. I wasn't aware and I apologize for my error.  I will say that this thing does more per shot than most snipers, so it is still devastating. **EDIT 2:** I did not realize it, but this thing does insane crit damage. I found another one that is not a Trick Shot, and it has a 89K base damage. it does 600K critical hit damage, so I am guessing around 500% crit damage is another stat for this gun.

**Storm:**

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=136292879

Sniper Rifle (Only a level 60, presumably, much higher)

Maliwan

64293 Damage

96.8 Accuracy

1.1 Fire Rate

4.0 Reload Speed

6 Round Clip

12240.6 Electric Damage

56.3% Chance to Shock

""Tut

When the shot hits something, like the Flakker. Judging by the name, I am guessing it only comes in shock (and since the other legendary Maliwan sniper is only fire).

**Avenger:**

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=136292936

SMG

Tediore

20322 Damage

93.3 Accuracy

9.3 Fire Rate

1.5 Reload Speed

49 Round Clip

15% Chance to Slag

""Counterbution revengence. The reckoning""

When thrown (reloaded) it bounces around on the ground, it explodes like normal.  absolutely devastating with slag in a crowd. just throw one in, and then bask in that sweet, sweet x3 damage. **EDIT:** apparently, according to some on the gearbox forums, this gun regenerates ammo. I don't know what that means or if it is true, but that's what they're saying

**Butcher:**

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=136292903

Shotgun (this is the first one I found

Hyperion

5837x3 Damage

77.1 Accuracy

7.0 Fire Rate

2.9 Reload Speed

12 Round Clip

4604.4 Corrosive Damage

8% Chance to Corrode

""Fresh Meat!""

This is the best shotgun in the game. the fire rate is insane for a shotgun. the accuracy gets high a lot faster than the hearbreaker or CC

Regarding where these dropped, I can guess that these guns have the lowest drop rate imaginable.  I saw probably 30 legendaries at least between each pearl. If you are gonna farm these (I have no idea who or what is most likely to drop them), be prepared to get frustrated.

a few notes about UVHM: you current legendaries are going to go out of style fast. this is hard city, the chests will still be leveled to the one you were at when you entered the area.  This is exactly the kind of content that I think a lot of people stuck at End Game were looking for.

If any of you guys find any other ones

**AUTHOR'S NOTE** for anyone who hates modding the game, and he never will be unless I am playing with friends. I have a legit character that I will be playing UVHM with, so don't bitch about the fact that I am cheating.

1352177177.0,12po4w,A new Class idea- Dex: The Nano Engineer,Fearless_Idiot,329,105,77,"I was wondering what the next class might be

Axton the fighter, Zero the rogue and Gaige the necromancer. 

So I figured

Now

Action skill- Nano Burst

Dex fires a cloud of nano bots in front of him in a wide area

Each of the three trees has several skills that effect how Nano-burst works

Skill tree- ""Look Left and Cough""-
This is the Enemy debuff tree

- Adds corrosive damage to Nano-Burst
- The Nano bots will jam enemy guns occastionally if they are effected.
- Enemies who come into close proximity to an enemy effected by nano burst has a chance to have the swarm spread to him
- Each enemy killed will increase the size and the duration of the Nano swarm up to a size cap
- The Nano bot clouds explodes once it begins to dissipate. the bigger the cloud
- Nano bots take control over enemies they kill turning them into temporary allies and even more entertaining

The Nano bot cloud also can be useful for you directly

**EDIT**

Skill Tree- ""Just a Little Prick"": This is the more defense buff oriented tree. here there are skills for health

- Increased health regen while nano burst is on cooldown
- Deals spike damage to melee enemies 
- The cloud will increase the amount of time you or an ally can be in FFYL
- Heal allies who walk through the nano bot cloud
- If Nanoburst in ready and you enter FFYL the nano bots create a cloud shaped like yourself and allow you to continue fighting like normal. if you get a kill you get up just like before

Now the best part about these nano bots is that they can work together to accomplish impressive things

Skill tree ""Non-Biological Warfare"": now this one is for the gun runners out there. this is all about offense

- The Nano Burst swarm will slag enemies
- The Nano Burst will regen ammo while they are not on cool down
- The Nano bots will coat your bullets in themselves turning them into explosive rounds 
- If you walk through the nano cloud you gain increased accuracy and recoil reduction 
- Activating nano burst a second time while active will cause the swarm to attach to your weapon drastically improving it's stats and giving an enemy you kill with it to have a chance to drop a mirv grenade

So there you have it

Let me know what you guys think

So since as long as Zer0's skill trees have been known, is the higher you level, the greater the difference between a standard hit and a critical hit becomes. So at level 10 when you body shot an enemy with a sniper, it almost kills them as fast as a headshot would. By the time you reach level 20, it takes three body shots to equal the insta-gib damage of a critical hit. I understand there is intended to be a fair amount of skill involved in making any sniper spec effective in pretty well any FPS game. However, when you're dealing with a vast range of enemies, some who will take really heavy damage and march slowly towards you, and everything in between, sniper class mods are a total crap-chute because you either sacrifice survivability for damage output

So at level 20, which made the game overall less ridiculously stressful. However as mob health pools grew exponentially faster than my melee damage, and enemies got more and more badass, it stopped feeling useful by about level 28. Once again, I've tried the spec again at 50, with a few different melee weapon/shield combinations, and I still couldn't put enough damage to make that final skill in the tree useful

Finally I decided to switch to Cunning, mixed with good gun damage, which made Eridium Blight onwards a total breeze. I decided to wait until 40 to step into TVHM, and I'm glad I did. I don't know how it would have worked out at 36 when I finished PT1, because even at 40, I got torn apart. I experience death after death, no matter how much I geared up, painfully

Playing with friends, but even then, Cunning just outshines both Sniping and Bloodshed. I know this isn't some PvP MMO that needs to be super balanced or anything, but I feel ripped off that a class made strictly for damage output, has equal (or less) potential damage output than other classes who have a much more dynamic set of skill trees that are based on more than just short, medium and long range fighting styles, especially when he has absolutely no crowd control abilities.

I'm not demanding a fix, but I'm just really disappointed over a character I was looking forward to play for a long while and thought I'd share my sadness in this fact.

I've seen countless threads in which people seeking help with playing Zer0 are constantly being told to go Cunning spec

TL;DR: Zer0 has disappointed me in his lack of damage output for a strictly damage oriented class.

EDIT: Really appreciate the discussion. Obviously there are people on a varying spectrum of feelings about Zer0 as a character. I just wanted to say

EDIT 2: Something I meant to mention in my original post was that I love Zer0 on boss encounters. With his ridiculous reload speed and quick elemental damage application

-----------------------

Ok, at level 6 starting in Sanctuary.  I was shooting for a Level 5 character, but it turns out that's actually impossible.  There's more details in the enclosed readme.txt, but these were all made by playing them through to that point in-game, doing only the story missions required to get into sanctuary, only killing what needs to be killed to move the story along to there, and still leaving everything else in the game for the player to do.

*: The only thing I did was use Cheat Engine to lock my shields and HP at max for effective God Mode.  This didn't affect stats or leveling in any way, though.  Using that it took me 45 minutes to an hour for each run, and a lot of that was standing around getting shot.  Without godmode running, it would have simply been impossible to get to Sanctuary with no sidequests even acknowledged and at such a low level.  Other than that though, the saves are completely natural.  There was no hex editing involved, and they're all just like they would be if you started a character up yourself and managed to luck yourself to Sanctuary at level 6.

Hopefully someone will get some use out of these.  I haven't seen a starter pack or anything posted here before.  I know after starting brand new five times in a row I sure as Hell never want to be forced through the intro again

Also, let me know and I'll see what I can do.

**Unique Quest Pistols**

***Dahl Dahlminator***

    Quest: The Lost Treasure (Sawtooth Cauldron/ Caustic Caverns)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: High
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Low

*I feel that the Dahlminator is quite worth using, and usually has good other stats. It's great for second winds in hyperion areas since you barely have to aim, and also good for taking out troublesome constructors and SB Loaders since you can still hit by firing it around cover and letting it home in. I guess it depends on playstyle and such but I for one love the thing.*

***Hyperion Fibber***

    Quest: A Real Boy: Human (Eridium Blight)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Low
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Medium/High

*It's entirely worth waiting til' 2.5 to farm this gun, but since you're already in the eridium blight, endgame scaling is right around the corner.*

***Hyperion Lady Fist***

    Quest: Uncle Teddy (Arid Nexus - Badlands) (Turn in the mission to Una Baha)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Low/Medium
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Medium/High

*Decent Hyperion pistol, It doesn't shine very well at the point you get it in the game (loaders are odd..) And i haven't seen it ever have an element. But a Redundant prefix (Double fire) can make this gun sing, when it connects with a sweet spot, that is. However, it's still not worth farming unless you have endgame crits in mind.*

***Jakobs Law***

    Quest: Won't Get Fooled Again (Sanctuary)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: High
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefullness: High/Ultra-High

*When Paired with the Order Shield, but for that endgame smack n' heal, you're going to want to hold off til jack is good and dead.*

***Moxxi's Rubi (Maliwan)***

    Quest: Rakkaholics Anonymous (Sanctuary/ The Dust) (Turn in to moxxi)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Medium
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: High

*There are threads in both Gaige and Zero forums that suggest high to perhaps very high value for both the Rubi pistol and Hail assault rifle. A Rubi, you've got a cross between the Law + Order builds and Slag Rapier + Love Thumper builds.*

***Dahl Teapot***

    Quest: You Are Cordially Invited: Tea Party (Tundra Express)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Medium
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Medium

*A gun i've never really payed attention to, and can really put the hurt on those loaders later on in the story.*

***Vladof Veritas***

    Quest: Clan War: Wakey Wakey (The Highlands) (One of 2 possible Unique Rewards)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Low
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Low

*A gimmicky gun. To be used with friends all running gimmicky equipment just to have gimmicky stats that can't amount to much when the gun lacks any real punching power (no more than any other vladof machine pistol). Not worth keeping unless you have some sort of gimmicky boss run planned (true friends required)*

**Unique Quest Shotguns**

***Moxxi's Heart Breaker (Hyperion)***

    Quest: Safe And Sound (Sanctuary/ Caustic Caverns) (Turn in to Moxxi)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: High
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: High

*Openly admitting i'm in love with this gun. Fixed fire pattern that's easy to aim, and it's a hyperion, so added accuracy while you're holding the trigger down. It turns fleshy enemies into goo as long as it's not madly outleveled (scaling is a bitch). Endgame, it's arguably one of the best single-shell shotguns in the game (only other one that comes to mind is the CC, and that's a Hyperion too). Worth grabbing during the story for it's sheer usefulness, and worth farming if you are planning to build around it.*

***Torgue Landscaper***

    Quest: Clan War: Hodunks vs. Zafords (The Dust) (If you side with the Hodunks)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Low
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Low

*It... just doesn't fire enough projectiles to be of any use.. Not to mention the odd firing angle, but siding with the hodunks gives you the ability to farm the Zafords for a Jakobs Maggie. You can only win for losing, i guess.*

***Tediore Octo***

    Quest: Slap Happy (Sanctuary/ The Highlands - Outwash)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Low/Medium
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Low

*Slow-firing projectiles that are easy to aim but hard to hit with. Poor endgame damage with no significant bonuses. A decent shotgun during the storyline only if it does more damage than your current.*

***Bandit RokSalt***

    Quest: Splinter Group (Sanctuary/ Bloodshot Stronghold)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Medium
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Low

*Your average bandit shotgun, accuracy, or general boost). Endgame... it's just another bandit shotgun. Worth doing this quest as it comes up, don't bother saving it for later.*

***Hyperion Shotgun 1340***

    Quest: Out Of Body Experience (Bloodshot Stronghold/ Sanctuary) (Turn in to Marcus)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Medium/High
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Low

*The ""Bro-gun"" as i like to call it. Solid shotgun all around

    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Low
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Low

*I don't have much to say about this gun. Mediocre damage

    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Ultra-Low* (*See: Ultra-High)
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Ultra-Low* (*See: Ultra-High)

*If you don't know why this gun is of ultra-high usefulness.. I won't be the one to tell you.. To the rest of you who keep an Evil Smasher in your 4th slot.. Walk softly and smash strongly. I simply advise that no one ever toss this gun. Ever.*

***Vladof Hail***

    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Low
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Medium/High

*I don't want to misspeak but from what I understand, and Close Enough and you've got chaos if you're able to aim correctly (learning curve.)*

***Dahl Scorpio***

    Quest: Bearer of Bad News (Sanctuary)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: High
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Medium

*Amidst all the bad news, if it exists). Great gun to get you through the last bit of the game. Also worth saving til endgame to acquire.*

    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Medium
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Medium?

*Along with openly admitting i love the Heart Breaker, and with a massive bonus to critical, i'd assume it's actually decent. Probably wouldn't hurt to pick this up endgame.*

I've thought about this

New-U is sold as a written contract, from a business perspective, it wouldn't make sense: nobody would risk their life signing a contract with them knowing that it could be revoked. In fact, it could be that some component of digistruct technology actually makes revocation impossible during the contract period.

The Borderlands universe was once a place where New-U was dirt cheap, followed shortly by gun technology, and the arms race to 87 bazillion was on.

Hyperion provides a free contract to vault hunters as compensation for their services. This is why vault hunters are the world's heroes: no one else on Pandora can afford a contract. Other people don't go out in the dangerous world

So, Jack's death is the result of leveraging ALL of his digistruct data at once -- multiple body doubles -- in his mad lust for power. It's possible that Angel has a backup somewhere and is laying low. I still don't trust her.](http://www.reddit.com/spoiler)

Does anyone else have a theory as to what might explain the ""died in a cutscene"" phenomenon?

*edit:* A few people are talking about some of Burch's comments that sound like he regrets adding a voice to the New-U. The quote is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13gsxi/iama_mister_torgue_and_will_answer/c73w94h). My take on this comment is that he **agrees** that it's a story problem (albeit a minor one) now that it's been written in.

For a guide on how to spawn Terramorphous at a higher level

---
TERRAMORPHOUS' VARIOUS ATTACKS:
---
---
**1. Terramorphous' Iconic ""HULK SMASH"":** Terra gets mad and smashes the floor in front of him with his two front tentacles dealing a large area of affect to anyone caught in the attack's sphere of influence. It's important to note that this attack is designed to only bring you down to near death (regardless of level). Though rarely

**2. Terramorphous' detested ""BITCH SLAP/S"":** Probably the most infuriating thing Terramorphous can do to any player is slap them out of the ring. In his most infuriating iteration of his slap attack, also has a very narrow area of effect. His other slap attacks are not quite as note worthy, but consist of an upper-cut like slap which seems to only have a localized area of effect, and single tentacle slaps which for the most part only induce panic but are easily avoidable.

**3. Terramorphous' Spike Tentacle:** (see below under ""TENTACLES AND THEIR VARIOUS ATTACKS"" For more information on the mechanics of this attack.) This is the same attack that his stand-alone Spike Tentacles will dish out except Terramorphous himself will shoot off several spikes in your direction.

---
TERRAMORPHOUS' TENTACLES AND THEIR VARIOUS ATTACKS:
---
---
Along with Hulk Smashing and Bitch Slapping any unprepared Vault Hunters who wander into his lair and blow on his bone horn

**1. Terramorphous' Spike Tentacle:** One of the first tentacles you are most likely to come in contact with

**2. Terramorphous' Rock Tentacle:** More often than not, except the projectile thrown in this case is a large boulder that has a small area of affect upon impact. These boulders move quite slowly and are easily avoided as long as you are aware of your surroundings and do not corner yourself against any walls.

**3. Terramorphous' Beam Tentacle:** Most likely the third tentacle you will encounter, you may want to avoid shooting and just focus on sprinting perpendicular to the beam's trajectory (once the beam tentacles have locked on to you and fired, they are slow to move and can be avoided in this fashion).

**4. Terramorphous' Masher Tentacle:** One of the last tentacles to spawn, sprinting out of their circle of influence, or strafing around each smash are your best chances at overcoming this tentacle. 

**5. Terramorphous' Fire Tentacle:** These are the last tentacles that you will see when fighting Terramorphous. More often than not they will spawn in conjunction with Terramorphous when he uses his special ability to become a Fyre Thresher (see ""BEAST MODE""). These particular tentacles have the same firing mechanics as the Spike Tentacles but instead of firing a physical spike projectile

---
TERRAMORPHOUS' UNIQUE ABILITY AND ATTACK:
---
---
**1. BEAST MODE (Fire Thresher):** Terramorphous will eventually activate his unique ability by lighting himself on fire. While on fire his durability against any attacks goes up and he becomes fire resistent/immune (depending on your level differences). While in Beast Mode

**2. BLACK HOLE OF (NEAR) GUARANTEED DEATH:** Terramorphous will at times randomly generate a black hole which will suck every player in the ring towards the center

---
VARIOUS STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS!!:
---
---
I find that the best defense is the best offense when fighting Terramorphous. And though that may be the case

Here are some basic tips on guaranteeing your prolonged survival against Terramorphous. 

**1. Never stay in once place too long

**Why is this the case?**
Terramorphous will pop his head out of the ground and single out one player to either smash or slap. If you happen to be hiding behind one of the two rocks, you will go FLYING off the edge of the map. This is even worse if you try to ""jump"" to evade his attacks (you won't evade them). Being in the air while hit by Terramorphous' slap will nearly guarantee your death by flying out of the ring. Resist the urge to jump. 

For those that prefer to hug the back wall closely

**What should i do then?** Your goal should be to persuade Terramorphous to pop out from the very center of the ring as often as possible. When popping out from the center

You can use certain Terramorphous mechanics to your advantage. Instead of hugging walls and hiding behind rocks like a little bitch, he will fling you up vertically into the air (but you will not take any damage from this, which is great for those with Bee Shields). Take this opportunity to lay down some fire on Terra and try to reposition your descent BEHIND where Terramorphous is currently facing. More often than not, Terramorphous will have already done his smash attack/slap while you are in the air (which you will have handily avoided). But if not, when you land, Terra might decide to do a 180 degree turn and smash/slap you. Just take the damage. The smash will not kill you in one hit, and the slap will not fling you off the edge. Go collect some health from his tentacles or bathe in some transfusion grenade plus signs. 

In regards to the two rocks near the center of the ring. Their utility as cover should only apply to beams and projectiles being launched at your player. In terms of using them as protection against Terramorphous' smashes and slaps

**2. Always go for his tentacles first!:** More often than not, ammo, and grenades. These are all things that are necessary to keep the fight going. Also, these drops are another incentive for you to NOT camp, as you will be unable to pick up these goodies unless you move around the map. More grenades means more transfusions giving you health at a given time. More hypo's on the ground means that your chances of counteracting Terramorphous' Fire Nova DoT are increased as you can run over the hypo's to stay above zero health. Ammo is important, how else are you going to keep that amped Conference Call of yours loaded throughout the match? (joke). Also, aim for the tentacles' critical point (the yellow/orange eye in the center of the tentacle).

**3. Use Fire Elemental Weapons Where Applicable!:**Terramorphous is a ""flesh"" based enemy as designated by his red health bar. This means that on True Vault Hunter Mode, and receive the multiplier bonus. When he does become a fire thresher, it's best to swap out your fire weapon for something non elemental, or shock based (as shock does not have any weaknesses) when attacking his main shaft.

**4. Save Yourself:** Know how you can be a hero? Not by saving your friend's ass and possibly getting killed in the process. It's by staying alive. When in doubt

---
HOW TO BE A TEAM PLAYER:
---
---
**1. Follow all the rules listed above in the section labeled as ""Various Strategies for Success"".**

**2. Play your character.** As in

**Gunzerkers (Salvador) [Gunzerking]** should focus on what they do best

**Assassins (Zer0) [Deception]** Should death mark as often as possible. All assassins in a team based setting should invest in the Cunning tree to be able to deathmark at range. (and to also inflict status effects on lvl 52 Terramorphous).

**Sirens (Maya) [Phaselock]** You are the healers of the party. Your job is to res someone when they are down. Most Sirens may also be the team's ""designated slagger

**Commandos (Axton) [Sabre Turret(Girlfriend)]** ~~are sadly not as useful against Terramorphous as other classes may be (Just my observation).~~ As a soldier

**Mechromancers (Gaige) [Death Trap]** Mechromancers do not have the same utility as other characters in team based play. Deathtrap is readily killed by higher level Terramorphii and can only contribute to the team by replenishing shields (Buck Up skill) (which can be handy when Bee shield's need topping off).

THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN FIGHTING A HIGHER LEVEL TERRAMORPHOUS (Level 65+)
---
---

Assuming you are at the current level cap (50), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/12zo6t/how_to_make_your_game_more_challenging_andor/), for information on how to alter the level that Terramorphous spawns at. 

1. He cannot take on any status effects. That means, shocked, or slagged. His level is just far too high relative to yours.

2. Unless you have a very cohesive team that follows all the rules i outlined above

3. DPS is King and will improve your survival rate. A bee shield is necessary at this level. A bee shield with tediore shield parts (you can use a save editor to check what parts your bee shield has) will enable you to have a base recharge time of 3.13 seconds. Faster recharge trumps higher amp damage as you will be amped far more often (no point in having high amp damage if you can't use it). Conference calls are the weapon of choice when fighting a large boss such as Terramorphous. The gun's unique ability to spawn perpendicular bullets along the original blast's trajectory will do massive (lol not really) damage against Terramorphous. Norfleets (or any other high base damage weapon) may get you a kill revive in fight for your life.

4. Gunzerker should be the host whenever possible. Gunzerker's can dual wield two weapons (most likely conference calls) at a time. When not hosting,,False,self,t5_2r8cd,1352668524.0,,True

1374644231.0,1ixtmz,Ninj-Academy: A Guide to Melee Zer0,Blockorz,212,29,57,"**Introduction**

Greetings, leave it in the comments!

*Melee Formula: How Melee Damage is calculated
*Equipment: The Ninja's Arsenal
*Skill Tree  Setups: How to make the most of your character
*Techniques: Things to use to increase your efficiency in combat
*Useful Links and other Stuff

**Melee Formula: How Melee Damage is calculated**
The general formula for melee on Zer0 looks like this: (Base+Roid) x Ambush x Backstab x Execute x Killing Blow x [Weapon Bonus x (%Deception + %Iron Hand + %Counter Strike + %Rising Shot + %Be Like Water + %Followtrough + %Like The Wind + %Class Mod + %BadAssRank) + 0. Relic Percentage] x Slag x Crit x Death Mark

A Level 61 characters Base Melee Damage is equal to 34580. Roid damage is the bonus damage added from your Roid Shield

Weapon Bonus is for Bayonet Accesories. 200% on the Rapier

Critical Hits double your Damage, use Deception to get behind the enemy and hit them in their Critical Spot(s).

A 'perfect' set up can get you a 60.48 Multiplier on your Melee Damage (this includes Counter Strike proccing and Killing Blow activating). The highest Multiplier possible is 155.52

**Equipment: The Ninja's Arsenal**

Weapons:

*Rapier: Unique Quest Reward obtained from 'Message in a Bottle' quest, Low chance to apple DoTs (8%), User takes increased Melee Damage while weapon is in their hands,

*Law: Unique Quest Reward obtained from 'Won't Get Fooled Again' quest or as a rare drop from the Sheriff of Lynchwood. The Quest can be done after completing 'Wildlife Preservation'. Always spawns with a Blade accessory

*Slag Evisceration Rubi: Unique Quest Reward obtained from 'Rakkaholics Anonymous' quest, one Melee Strike can fully heal the Player!

*Evisceration Little Evie: Unique Drop obtained from Mr. Bubbles in Magnys Lighthouse. You will not gain the reward if you hurt Lil' Sis during the fight, but I enjoy using it for fast cooldowns.

Shields:

*Love Thumper: Unique Quest Reward obtained from 'Best Mother's Day Ever' quest located in The Highlands. This quest randomly drops from Stalkers after completing 'Stalker of Stalkers'. This shield always spawns witha huge Recharge Delay and causes an explosive Nova every time a melee strike hits an enemy. It also hurts teammates

*Hide of Terramorphuos: Legendary Drop obtained from Terramorpheus the Invincible. The Maximum Roid damage for this shield hits at 211625, since it has the highest damage output.

*Order: Unique Quest Reward obtained from the mission 'BFFs' located in Sanctuary. This quest will show up after 'Won't get fooled again' and 'Where Angels Fear To Thread' are completed. When used together with the earlier mentioned Law Revolver, since you can get more damage done with a Hide or a Love Thumper.

*Pun-Chee: Unique Seraph item obtained from trading with the Seraph Vendor in the Badass Crater of Badassitude. With the best parts

Grenades:

*Stormfront: Legendary Grenade Mod dropped from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Rats located in Bloodshot Stronghold. Always Shock Element

*Chain Lightning/Lightning Bolt: Legendary/Unique Grenade Mod dropped from Sorcerers in the 4th DLC. Always Shock Element. Great alternative to the STormfront

**Skill Tree  Setups: How to make the most of your character**

Generally

At Level 50

You may switch up skill points as you see fit, as it comes down to user preference. 

Some Notes about certain Skills:

Ambush is active while in deception. Therefore

Grim is no good when using a Roid Shield. If you get one kill, it is useful for gun-based Zer0 builds.

Unforeseen works with every Decoy you put out

Rising Shot works with Melee attacks. Spam your Melee Button at an enemy and you'll be at 5 stacks quite quickly. Plus

Two Fang is a good skill

**Techniques: Things to use to increase your efficiency in combat**

*Stripping your shield: This is useful when playing with (for example) a Hide of Terramorphus. This shield doesn't stay down for ages like the Love Thumper does

1369699967.0,1f6281,Let's talk Threequels,Draithian,204,44,233,"I'm actually interested to know the general consensus in the community, in their comments


My general opinion is yes; there could be a Borderlands 3 that is a fun, let alone exceed it:

* Anthony Burch
* Unique dialogue sequences for each of the vault hunters
* Better accommodations for those who enjoy hoarding and collecting weapons
* A small overhaul of the gun generation system


Anthony Burch is an amazing writer


A unscratchable itch for lots of people is the indifference of the NPCs concerning who you play as. I was hoping Lilith would freak out when she saw another siren, who to the casual observer is just as deranged and psychotic as all of the other psychos. This could have been a good way to make other character playthroughs even more game changing and refreshing and I think Gearbox missed out.


33 inventory spaces is clearly not enough space to hold a bazillion guns, the Gearbox wanted to improve the UI from the previous game, as well as stress the ""constant"" progression of loot and of finding better things. Once guns stop becoming obsolete as the player gains levels however, these design decisions become impediments to late game enjoyment. Obviously there is no simple solution to this, but perhaps a secondary bank such as a library that would look more like the inventory of the first game, which a player could pay a fee to store and withdraw guns from.


Finally, and guns became a little monotonous. For example, every SMG felt the same as all the others from that manufacturer, and I ended up with only 5 SMGs to choose from.

These are the things that were just not at all good for me:

* Bandit pistols, Shotguns.
* Hyperion sniper rifles
* Dahl sniper rifles.
* Tediore shotguns.
* Maliwan pistols.
* Any AR with a Torgue barrel.
* ARs in general

5 of 7 manufacturers had at least one weapon type that did not work (with the exception of some uniques) with their brand characteristics. I think there are a few ways of improving the gun diversity. For starters, and please for the love of god Gearbox, let every manufacturer produce every weapon type! Even if you do get some that just don't work, or don't make sense, that adds to the diverse feel of the game! A Dahl shotgun for example, or a Torgue sniper rifle, offer fresh combinations of weapon and characteristics. There may be more duds


**TL;DR:** We need good writing, and MOAR guns for there to be a good BL3.


**EDIT:** There are a few ideas brought up that I missed entirely or did not include


* Reactive dialogue
* Fully fleshed out vehicle options/customization.
* More RPG elements
* An even larger more intensive overhaul of the gun system.",self,t5_2r8cd,1369767281.0,,krieg2,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1f6281/lets_talk_threequels/

1369578487.0,1f2ye0,A thought I had the other day...,LeJoker,192,35,43,"I own BL2 on both 360 and PC

I'd say the vast majority of 360 players I encounter don't use voice chat (not sure if PS3 players are any different) and it gets quite difficult to coordinate with other players when the only form of contact you can make with them is trying to interpret their pattern of jumping into actually saying something intelligible. 

My suggestion would be a sort of radial voice chat menu such as that used in games like Left 4 Dead 1/2 or Battlefield 2 (in subsequent Battlefield games

Stuff that should be included in the menu:

 * Look at this gun! (Or a ""look"" that uses context of what you're aiming at like L4D)
 * Help me!
 * Use your ability!
 * Look out
 * Follow me.
 * You take point.
 * Wait a moment.
 * Hurry up!
 * Yes/No

This menu would also be a good opportunity to hear the Vault Hunters talk a little bit more in the awesome dialogue writing that we've all come to expect from Gearbox.

How best to get the attention of vault hunters everywhere? First

So several hours before the level cap release

Don't analyze that last sentence too much. 

And don't announce the glitch publicly. If the loot is seen as a gift, the news will be a word-of-mouth wildfire, gamers rushing to capitalize on the gushing geysers of gunny goodness.

Then, eager to try out their new weapons, as the level increases silently drag the new guns down into level 50 irrelevance.

What happens is the game will freeze often after an auto save, or ejecting the disc, its a hard freeze that looks like it might be damaging to the system itself.  The glitch happens if you are online, offline, playing on another xbox with a recovered account.  There was a flash drive work around for this problem, that worked for some but seems to not work anymore due to recent patches.  Gearbox has been pretty quiet on this subject, and when enough of a fuss was made on their forums they released a patch.  

Now this patch they released has made the freezing more constant and worse.  Players like myself can no longer get past the 2k screen when the game is loading.  Where this post comes in is; what can we the people affected by this glitch do?  Asking Gearbox about it has brought back nothing but silence

----

The one I found

**Rock Golem** (60) --&gt; remove Core

**Unbound Golem** (61) --&gt; it gets 1 kill

**Reckless Golem** (62-63) --&gt; it gets 2 kills

**Nasty Golem** (64-67) --&gt; it gets 4 kills

**Imposing Rock Golem** (68-71) --&gt; it gets 4 kills

**Rock GOD** (72)

----

It's just like the Goliaths in that it just takes kills to get it to the final form. Unlike the Goliaths though, bunch of eridium, a green, and a purple). 

They are quite difficult to take down as the Rock GOD. I dropped my dual nuke turrets 3 times and nearly put 1000 rounds of my Slagga with a bee shield (with nearly all rounds getting the bonus damage) into him before he went down. They are non-slag-able though.

I checked around and found that this information wasn't really anywhere yet. Orcz.com only has up to Reckless and doesn't say anything about how to evolve them. So I hope this is useful for people.

----

EDIT: Couple things I thought of to also add. 

**[1]** Once they are at Rock GOD

**[2]** ~~I don't know what happens if you allow a plain Rock Golem to kill an enemy. This wouldn't take much work to find out and I'll edit when I get around to finding out.~~ If a Rock Golem kills an enemy

**[3]** I would be willing to bet that if there were a minimum of 4 other enemies attacking it

**[4]** I don't know anything about the experience gained from killing any of the levels (considering I'm level 61). If I had to guess

----

EDIT 2:

**[1]** I did some testing on the Rock Golem near the entrance to Flame Rock (in Unassuming Docks) to figure out this 72/73 thing. When I got all the information above, I **did NOT** say that higher levels weren't possible. I just said once it reaches Rock God, it doesn't level anymore. 

Now, it did become a Unbound Rock Golem but it did not level up. For the second try I also got him the Rock GOD at level 71 (there was one time he killed two enemies at once so that might have had something to do with it.) But he killed me before I could try and get him to kill some more and when i revived he was cone but was replaced by a new 61 Rock Golem. Upon core destruction on this one, he did not level up.

**[2]** Just got that last Golem to Rock God at level 71. I then let it kill 4 more enemies and it **DID NOT LEVEL AGAIN**.

----

EDIT 3:

**[1]** It would appear that the core destruction doesn't level up the Golem if he is already at 61. Also

**[2]** It's too bad that in Masterkizz's video we didn't see any of the lead up to Iron GOD. For starters, location-wise, so a higher level enemy would make sense. ",,False,self,t5_2r8cd,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1hba5y/xpost_rborderlands2_for_those_interested_in_the/

1352327827.0,12tn5b,garofalo's Awesome Guide to Extracting Audio from Borderlands 2 (plus some goodies),garofalo,185,30,27,"**PART UN**

The Borderlands 2 files are located (if you bought it on Steam) in

    steam\steamapps\common\Borderlands 2\WillowGame\CookedPCConsole

If you didn't buy it on steam

The files you're looking for are:

    Audio_Streaming.pck
    Audio_Banks.pck
    English(US)\Audio_Streaming.pck
    English(US)\Audio_Banks.pck

Everything I pull comes out of English Audio Streaming

**Download the [extractor](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6241970/extractor.zip)

Create a folder somewhere called BL2Audio. Copy the .zip files and the .pck files listed above to it and extract the .zips (they'll create folders). Rename the two English(US) .pck files to ""English_Audio_Streaming"" and ""English_Audio_Banks"", so it's a good one to test on) to scan and select *BL2Audio\English_Audio_Banks* as your extraction location. Click Start.

The extractor will scan and show you a window with a bunch of files. Click the small + at the bottom left and click Ok when the mask dialog comes up with *.* as the default. That should select all the files the extractor found. Click Ok again and click Extract. Verify your output folder and click Ok. That should extract all the .wav files to the specified folder. However

**EDIT: semi_modular_mind [found an easier way to do this next part](http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/12tn5b/garofalos_awesome_guide_to_extracting_audio_from/c6ybw3s). After the extraction, and rename the files. I'm testing it now, and will update when I find out whether this works excellently or just well.**

**EDIT 2: Well, and kudos to semi_modular_mind for finding this.**

Now here's the annoying part. Because of how the files are connected

Now that you have one folder of .txt files and one of .wav, and revorb.exe into *English_Audio_Streaming* (the one with the .wav files). Open Command Prompt, navigate to the folder, and run the following command (copy it, right click in Command Prompt, and select Paste):

    FOR /F ""tokens=*"" %G IN ('DIR /B *.wav') DO ww2ogg.exe ""%G"" --pcb packed_codebooks_aoTuV_603.bin

That will give you .ogg files for every .wav file. Don't worry about the truncation error. Still won't be able to play the files

    for /r %f in (*.ogg) do @revorb ""%f""

Now you should have a folder full of .ogg files that you can play with VLC or WinAmp or whatever player you use. You can enter ""wav"" into the search box and delete all the .wav files now.

Repeat this with all the .pck files you want to extract from. I recommend prefixing the extracted files (ReNamer can do this too) with the .pck name (e.g. ""English_Audio_Streaming"" or ""Audio_Banks"") and placing all the .txt files into the same folder - I call mine ""All TXT Files"" (brilliant convention, named after the .pck file they came from.

**PART DEUX**

If you navigate to *Borderlands 2\WillowGame\Localization\INT* you'll find a bunch of .int files. (There are other localization folders for other languages, is the subtitles for all of Chapter 1. Marcus's intro line, ""So, you want to hear another story, eh? One where the very fate of Pandora hangs in the balance? If not, too bad -- I'm telling you anyway."", is the first subtitle of the chapter.

The bracketed name, surprise - also encoded into the wav file of Marcus's voice. That way the subtitles can display at the same time as the file is playing out of the compressed .pck file. Copy the name, with or without the brackets, and use Windows search in the folder of .txt files you created earlier.

The VO Episode assets are all (for me) in *English_Audio_Streaming*. Of course, with 18,568 files after extraction.)

Anyway, open it in your favorite media player, and voila. You hear Marcus's husky baritone introducing the new and ""improved"" Pandora.

**PART TROIS**

I don't know how to locate specific music or sound effect assets. Which sucks, the non-subtitled rantings of the Pinocchio Loader. If anybody else comes up with a way, I'd love to hear it.

**EDIT 3: Found the Pinocchio Loader lines. They were subtitled. They start with ""vosq_boy"". Sweet.**

**PART QUATRE**

You've all been waiting for this. Here's my list of requested voiceover files (in a comment because of text post character limits). Links lead to my public Dropbox folder. Randy Pitchford (Gearbox President) hasn't replied to my tweet asking if this was okay, only thirty or so (I think that's a reasonable interpretation of ""few"" given that the number of subtitled sound assets is nearly 7,000) of the files in the comment below are active links.

Every game has a replay value; some have higher values than others. But in the end, as I mentioned at the start, well of course you're going to get bored. It's alright; there is no crime. Sure, future DLC will come and add to the replay value but you can only kill the same raid bosses for so long before it feels like a chore.

I know all this talk about crafting is probably never going to make it into the game

Also I think crafting totally takes the spirit out of the randomly generated loot system that keeps you going back and farming that same boss for that perfect drop.  It'd really kill replayability as you could easily whip together the uber-gun you wanted and then basically have nothing left to strive for.

 In the first game the cap wasn't raised until the third DLC. From memory that was about 2 years after release. This is one month after release. There are a large number of people who either havent finished the game yet

Secondly

Next DLC is intended to add content

And probably my favorite thing is that having less skill points make you use them wisely! Getting enough skill points now so you can get that second game changer just seems kind of over the top and would take away some of the diversity of the play styles. Yes it's probably going to happen in the future

Yeah. Four double slots

This is incredibly easily accomplished

Also

Edit: since I keep getting PMs about how it works


The bl2 slot machines use a random number generator that makes a variable between 1 and somereallybignumber. It then compares that to a table of ranges
All this is doing is making the random generator only output a certain value.
Full table here: 

0 - 6711 = White Weapon X-X-Head

6712 - 11745 = Green Weapon 3 x Cherries

11746 - 12249 = Blue Weapon 3 x Legs

12250 - 12299 = Purple/Pink Weapon 3 x Marcus

12300 - 12305 = Orange Weapon 3 x Vault (Jackpot)

12306 - 13143 = 3 x Eridium

13144 - 13395 = 3 x Double Eridium

13396 - 13470 = 3 x Triple Eridium (Jackpot)

13471 - 21860 = Money (Random amount)

21861 - 24377 = Boom 3 x Head

26056 - 32767 = Nothing

32768 - XXXXX = Break (Reload area to fix)

You use this by downloading cheat engine (cheatengine.org)(yes

Then, rename it ""borderlands2.ct"" (no quotes) Save it to my documents/my cheat tables

Then, click the glowy process button, select borderlands.

If done correctly
If not

Then

And finally


Anyway


Edit2: TIL everyone is really interested in getting this script. Getting a pm every other minute. So

I've compiled a short list of current issues that I have with Eridium
    
**User Interface:**

* As you've probably noticed
 * An easy solution from a development viewpoint would be to simply **change Eridium to a slighly different shade of purple**. It would not require any changes to the actual item models
* **Eridium is a currency, and there are no negative implications  to it that I can think of.
* **A player can only hold a maximum of 99 Eridium at a time.** This one may not be as important at the moment

**Gameplay:**

* As of now, but the cost is a mere 4 pieces. Other than that, everyone is just sitting around with 99 Eridium in their inventory with no actual purpose.
 * I'm a bit hesitant about solutions to this one, while isn't bad, might be less attractive to the developers. That being said, here are some of them:
     * **Raise the value of Eridium** by either making everything more expensive
     * **Invent new uses for Eridium**. This one was covered quite a bit by the folks over here in previous Eridium-related discussions, Eridium-based vending machines, more content that requires Eridium to access... This list goes on and on, and has some suggestions that I personally really like.

I'd like to thank you if you stuck with me thus far

1371749680.0,1gqmaq,Splinter Group side mission puzzle solved!,agroom,174,36,48,"It always annoyed me when summoning Flinter how this puzzle actually works (i.e. how the activation of each device effected the light outputs), but so far I have not found anything like this.  

**NOTE:** This DOES NOT reveal the sequence needed to summon Flinter

There's a lot of information here
*****
##Intro
*****
The puzzle is based on the use of binary bit-masking using the XOR gate. If you're not familiar with bit-masking or bitwise operations, we need think of the light as binary numbers instead of colors where:

* Red = 0 
* Green = 1

So when you first enter the room and all 5 lights are red

*****
##Devices &amp; Masks
*****

The room contains 4 devices: Valve, it alternates applying the two masks to the current state of the lights. 

Before going any further

Device|Position|Mask  
:---|:--:|:---
Valve|1|11000
 |2|10101
T.V.|1|10110
 |2|10000
Switch|1|01101
 |2|00001
Lever|1|10100
 |2|00011

Initially, would apply the mask '11000' and put the valve in position 2. Activating the Valve a second time would apply the mask '10101' and put the valve back in position 1. This rule applies even if other devices are activated in between. So if you activate the valve, switch and then the valve again, the valve will be back in position 1 and the switch in position 2.

**Note:** I read online that an activation sequence that works for one person may not work for another. This could mean that initial position might be random for each person. I've only been able to test this on my account

*****
##Bit Masking using the XOR gate (skip if you already know how)
*****
So what does this all mean? If you don't know how to do bit masking, if you XOR a 0 &amp; 0 or 1 &amp; 1 the result is a 0, and if you XOR a 1 &amp; 0 or 0 &amp; 1, the result is a 1. 

A|B|X| |A|B|X
-|-|-|-|-|-|-
0|0|**0**| |R|R|**R**
0|1|**1**| |R|G|**G**
1|0|**1**| |G|R|**G**
1|1|**0**| |G|G|**R**

This is called a truth table, just write it out like you would a 5 digit math problem:

     Initial State: 11000  GGRRR
              Mask: 10101  GRGRG
                    -----  -----
            Result: 01101  RGGRG

I represented this as both binary and R/G. You can start with any column and simply apply the rule from top to bottom for that column. So to solve this

1. 1 ⊕ 1 = 0 | G ⊕ G = R 
2. 1 ⊕ 0 = 1 | G ⊕ R = G 
3. 0 ⊕ 1 = 1 | R ⊕ G = G 
4. 0 ⊕ 0 = 0 | R ⊕ R = R 
5. 0 ⊕ 1 = 1 | R ⊕ G = G

Since we went from left to right

*****
##Summoning Flinter
*****

As I said, you then apply the mask, associated to its position, to the current state of the lights. Let's use the valve again an example. 

Device|Position|Current State|Mask|Resulting State
:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
Valve|1|00000|11000|11000

Activating the valve again would then result in:

Device|Position|Current State|Mask|Resulting State
:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
Valve|1|00000|11000|11000
Valve|2|11000|10101|01101

Cycling through a single device 4 times will return it to the state in which you started from. 

Device|Position|Current State|Mask|Resulting State
:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
Valve|1|00000|11000|11000
Valve|2|11000|10101|01101
Valve|1|01101|11000|10101
Valve|2|10101|10101|00000

The same process can be applied to any of the devices then until you get a result of 11111 or GGGGG.

*****
##Conclusion
*****

I'm sure you're thinking by now, because it's there! Though I personally think this was a lot of fun and very much enjoyed tackling this problem.

For anyone that's interested

**[EDIT 1]** FYI - To use the simulator, just delete the value in the device column. I only added coding for a limited number of attempts, so if you can't solve it by the end...well, start over :) It doesn't take that many steps to solve.

**[EDIT 2]** First I just thought I'd clarify since it seems I'm getting a lot of responses about it, although it started because I didn't know a set sequence before figuring this out, it really had nothing to do with wanting to get one. I just love to see puzzles like this and figure them out. Sure I could have looked it up, yes it would have been easier, but why? Where's the fun in that! :) I realize not everyone has that compulsion, but I guess I'm one of the few that does.  It's all about the trip, not the destination!

**[EDIT 3]** I think I understand the confusion. What I meant by ""solved the puzzle"" was that I solved how the puzzle works,False,self,t5_2r8cd,1371882314.0,,,t3_1gqmaq

I'm hoping that I'll be able to update this around ~twice a month (placing the second update I've done around the beginning of March)

**Introduction**:

Hey fellow vault hunters! It's been a while since we've seen an update to the Crowd Sourcing Project, 2013**. Some of the 18th's data may be included, as I had to reorganize the sheets for VHR/without VHR into something easier for me to work with. I'm also looking into making an automated system that we can use to constantly have up-to-date drop rates without any additional effort, so that will be CSP V4 most likely. So, if you're a web developer with some experience with databased, feel free to message me if you'd like to help.

You may notice that formatting may be a little different

submissions we have. Hopefully

runs.

Some notes:

* Don't submit your first (quest) kill for the Warrior. The odds of a Legendary drop are much

* For Terramorphous

* If a boss drops multiple Legendaries

* You may include Seraph items in your runs if they were dropped by a Seraph Guardian.

* Did you know? Bone Head 2.0 *doesn't* drop a legendary item. However

* According to one sly fellow

* The Borderlands wiki lists Doc Mercy's [drop rate](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Doc_Mercy) for the Infinity being at 0.07%. However

2. A penchant to want to shoot things.  No other NPC (except the original four Vault Hunters) is actually much of a combatant. Tina blows stuff up, because he is an NPC and that's how the game works)

3. His mechanical arm and leg could easily have translated into an action skill of sorts (though Gaige's didn't

**Artemis** as the Courier

Action Skill: **Fleetfoot**:  Grants a 100% movement speed boost and a 50% chance to dodge bullets for 30 seconds.
____
The Courier's shtick is his speed.  His abilities grant him speed bonuses to just about everything he does, to reviving his fellow Vault Hunters.  Depending on the tree you run down--that's a pun, you see--you can increase his survivability or decrease the amount of time it takes to kill somebody.

I've only got one tree so far

**Tree one: Run 'n Gun**

Swift Hands:  Increases reload speed (5 levels

Steady As She Goes:  Increases movement speed while aiming (5 levels

Swiftness: *Kill Skill.* Killing an enemy grants a bonus to movement speed and fire rate for a few seconds (5 levels

Moving On:  Increases weapon swap speed while moving (5 levels

Hard and Fast:  Increases melee damage (5 levels

Never Slow Me Down:  Minor Gamechanger.  Firing a weapon and using melee attacks no longer interrupt your sprint.

From the Hip:  Increases hip fire accuracy (5 levels

Ratatat-Tat:  Increases the fire rate of all automatic weapons while moving (5 levels

Catch a Bullet:  While sprinting

Running Throw:  Sprinting increases the distance you can lob grenades (5 levels

Defensive Line:  Major gamechanger.  *Melee Override.*  While Fleetfoot is active, it costs 5% of your current health, but the damage is increased even further.

----
So that's Artemis so far.  I know a few of the skills on the other trees, and another will cut the time it takes to revive a fallen ally in half.

So what do you guys think so far?  Too strong?  Need more info?  Complete crap?  Feedback is much appreciated,False,self,t5_2r8cd,False,,gaige,t3_1j76aj

1362604948.0,19ssub,A User-Friendliness Audit of Borderlands 2 (X-post from r/Borderlands2),arsefacey,153,20,54,"**TL;DR: I'm a web UX strategist and I've got some ideas to address user-friendliness problems in this game

For starters: I love BL1 and 2. LOOOOVE them.  But there are aspects of the interface that are clunky, and a lot of them create very harsh or ""unforgiving"" feel to what's otherwise a light, fun game.  Many are easily fixed.  For example (using 360 controls for reference):


###Sorting/Dropping Hotkey

A big rule of any interface is to *not* change the purpose of a key between similar interfaces.  Some screens (Quest log) use Y; others (Inventory) use LT/RT.  From one screen to the next

Using the triggers to scroll left/right through sorting mechanisms is a luxury not a need, dropping an item SHOULD use a non-standard, non-face button — I should need to think for a millisecond.


###Skill Tree

Let me add/remove points with A and B until I like what I've got (just like the calcs on the Borderlands site)


###Inventory Scrolling

Don't auto-scroll the inventory list when I'm selling/transferring items. It's disorienting to see the selection jump down to the bottom


###Using the Stash/Safe

The slots mean nothing and they have no inherent order, or I click to send away.  I can keep clicking things to send them over until the receiving container is full, at which point, I see the usual ~~full~~ cursor.  


###SHIFT Codes

All on-screen console keyboards suck. Not your fault, auto-enter hyphens every 5 digits to break the number up for easier reading/verification).


*The following two items are less about the interface and more about gameplay mechanics that I feel break from the ""kill stuff


###Lootsplosions (you kill a boss and loot explodes everywhere

These are too random and uncontrolled.  I understand the visceral/entertainment value of a flying pile of loot, I'm made to feel like killing the boss was a waste.  Whenever possible, use the chest/container/loot room approach for large scale looting (for regular mobs, dropping where they die is fine - part of the strategy is to *not* kill a dude on a roof if you want his drops).

If lootsplosions are considered too integral to the ""Borderlands Style, I can ""attract' that purple down off the giant pillar, and actually use or sell it.  And speaking of which...


###My pockets are full...(The Jackenstein Conundrum)

My theory is this: I killed a boss, and you've given me a room with 50 items in it. Jerk.  


Easy fix? Put a vending machine in loot rooms


Lore-friendly fix that still takes thought/strategy? I propose ECHO-Scan:


* I can scan any item in my inventory


* Next time I'm at a vending machine


In this scenario, and I still need to pick and choose what's permanently ""destroyed"" via scanning, and what's kept as a physical, usable item.  Maybe I can pay Eridium or something to ""un-scan"" an item? Mehh... nice-to-have, not necessary.

UVHM forces you to be conservative with your skill points

With 56 skill points you can capstone two skills. So long as you ignore the third tree and don't mind putting points into a couple skills you don't use. In actual gameplay, thoughtlock is kinda useless. Why bother speccing into that tree when you could build up maya's middle tree for scorn and snag the health regen skills on the way? Why spec out for a slag turret when you could go for an explosives axton and all you really need are the rockets? Bottom line, if you aren't using a skill put the points elsewhere. 

If you are like me, grenades, and relics. That's really all you should have in the bank, plus 2-3 of each in your backpack. Switching class mods or relics can be the difference between FFYL and winning, especially if you re-spec. Have a health relic on hand for when you gotta tank, and have a damage or allegiance relic on hand for when you gotta do damage. Have a couple shields on hand and switch out depending on the situation. Sham, neogenator, especially transfusion or leech grenades can be key. 

As for weapons, as well as some purples. 

You will need to use slag, corrosive, and shock weapon on hand. Yes, every character has a way to slag using skill points, but using a slag weapon is faster, does more damage, and doesn't have a cooldown.

UVHM forces you to optimize your character

tl;dr I like UVHM because it makes you think about how you play the game. ",self,t5_2r8cd,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1dwtd2/i_love_uvhm_heres_why/

Controls should be consistent between gameplay and menus:

- A menu button should ALWAYS toggle that menu
- Drop should always drop
- Use should compare in menu
- Reload should inspect in menu
- Movement keys should  select menu
- Right click should cancel a multi-step interaction (maybe)

- Text elements and pop-ups in cutscene videos appear off-screen
- Menu for Network Options and other submenus appear too large and run off-screen
- Popups for network status and friends joining/leaving appear too large and run off-screen
- Subtitles run by full screen width and span screen bezels; for readability
- Mouse cursor should default to center of the screen when opening the menu

**UI Activity**

- Challenge completions should list what has been completed as per challenge progress updates (e.g. ""Completed Challenge X part 1 *&lt;marquee effect&gt;* Killed 10 Skags by looking at them sternly""

- Challenge completion notifications should persist on-screen for about 50% longer than before

- Badass Rank updates should also indicate when a Badass Token has been awarded

- Ammo reserves for each ammo type should temporarily appear on-screen when ammo is looted or otherwise gained (e.g. through shield absorption)

- Minimap should be toggle-able and should have an option to scale independently of other UI/HUD elements

- Subtitles should appear in a sentence-by-sentence manner

- Story voiceovers and subtitles should have priority over all others

**Menus**

- Catch-A-Ride should save your previously used paint job for each vehicle across game sessions

- New-U Station should let you mark skins and heads as favourites

- Starred inventory items should not be able to be sold until the star is removed

- Ammo Dump should have a button to ""buy all"" and fill your ammo reserves (rockets excluded)

- Shops for unique-slot items (e.g. grenades and shields) should always show the item card for the item of that type which you have equipped

- ""Inspect"" screens should have an option to also list various DMG/DPS statistics (e.g. DMG*ROF

- Story and mission voice logs should be re-listen-able

**Item Cards**

- Item cards for equipped items should ALWAYS show the text/effect frame

- Manufacturer effects should be listed as a bullet point beside the logo (or underneath the manufacturer and weapon-class icons)

- Torgue effect should read ""Fires gyrojets instead of bullets""

- Elemental effects for grenade mods should be listed in the upper stats frame of the item card

- Zoom level should be communicated in the stats frame

**Gameplay**

- When joining a game session

- Ammo and money should be auto-looted regardless if they are in the world or in an opened container

- Auto-loot radius should be increased slightly to reach items that have fallen into objects or terrain

- Reviving should be triggerable through an additional command

- Badass Tokens should probably be able to be re-spec'd (personal opinion shared with a few other people)

- There should be a game option to toggle between ""weaponised"" and standard melee attacks when using weapons with bonus melee animations and damage

- Zer0's Decepti0n should highlight enemy crit locations with a red texture rather than a superimposed hexagon

**Splitscreen**

- (PS3/360) Menu/inventory screens cause noticeable slowdown

- (PS3/360) Splitscreen play should allow the second player to use their own PSN/XBL/local profile

-----

**BUGS**

- **Showstopping bug**: Players can be locked out of Tannis' intro scene and mission branch through some conjuction with Zed's mission ""Do No Harm""

- **Showstopping bug**: Some AMD processors present significant technical hurdles to getting the game to launch

- Some weapons that fire multiple bullets per shot also consume multiple bullets per shot without listing that effect in the item card's text frame

- Leaving iron sights while firing a Dahl burstfire stops the burstfire early

- Trade screens allow negative amounts of money to be traded

- Enemies can sometimes move

- Axton's second Gemini turret doesn't deploy if you try to deploy it too quickly after his first turret

- Maya's Acid Cloud prevents critical hits from registering critical damage

- Moxxi sometimes does not successfully award items for the tipping challenge

- Panting during sprinting does not halt or disappear if a menu is entered while sprinting

- Inventory sometimes re-orders itself when items are sold

- Salvador sometimes does not automatically reload empty weapons while Gunzerking

- Item cards of in-world items do not consistently align themselves to be on-screen

- Enemies sometimes get ""stuck"" and will not move or react to enemies

- Various objects in the world have oversized

- Loot Goliaths will sometimes cause players to be stuck in terrain or objects if the player is underneath the Goliath when it dies

- Exiting a flipped vehicle will sometimes cause players to unrecoverably fall through terrain

- (PC) Menus sometimes do not ""complete"" actions such as equipping a new weapon from your backpack or switching from one skill tree to another (even using the on-screen arrows)

- Kill skill icons sometimes do not appear along the XP bar

- (PS3/360) Sniper rifle impact points sometimes do not line up correctly with their crosshair aim points

- (PC) LAN games drop when Steam drops its connection to the Community

- (PC) General intermittent problems with multiplayer connectivity and match session persistence

We all know that with Tediore weapons, each round does 1,000 damage on said target... 50,000 weapon throw.. or whatever)  This can make equal some amazing damage if used properly...

Here's the interesting part.. if you equip an amp shield, and a Tediore weapon with a clipsize of 50 remaining... and each round does 1,000.. instead of a 50,000 weapon throw, it will be 550,000 damage.

2. A side effect of touching that door is you are now set to ""4 player"" mode

3. Head to [Tundra Express](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Tundra_Express) and find ""Old Man Johnson's Farm"". Inside his barn is a switch which disables the electricity to the nearby eaten house. Disable that electricity!

4. Head on down into that house to find a great save point.

Now we need some damage. The only REAL requirement is an [Evil Smasher](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Evil_Smasher) + a good weapon

1. Fire one shot, after which all other guns will ALSO have the black cloud special ability (Reloading will occasionally drastically raise all stats of the gun, the more capacity the stronger the gun). 

2. Repeat step 1 quickly

3. Stop mashing the reload buttons and swapping the gun. Go slower

I managed to get my infinity to 239 bullets after 10 - 20 minutes

FINALLY

1. Get into the loft of ""[Old Man Johnson's Farm](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Tundra_Express)"" and shoot towards the bugs. Sometimes I run jumping through them (I have a 72k turtle shield) just to get them riled up

2. Keep the bugs interested. You don't have to hit them

3. There is no required number of bugs needed, so WOO! Better odds. 

4. If he shows up, then RUN back to base (Shooting around them if they lose interest).

1372256568.0,1h3xhc,[SPOILERS] New boss strategies,bigbossodin,162,32,79,"###EDIT: Edited some of the skills of said bosses based off of feedback and more slaying.

So

Allow me to offer some insight.

Before we get started, etc.  This is merely for how to *kill* the damn things.

Let's begin;

****

###Who are they?

****

First off, but they each have a specific bonus that compliments the other Dragons.

You'll have to forgive me

**SLAG**:  This guy has the slag element, and Slag beams, akin to The Warrior.

**SHOCK**: This is your next target.  His name is Healthiamamallamadingdong.  Basically, but he will make your fight with the other Dragons easier, provided you can take him down.  His attacks range from bites, to shock waves, and shock balls.  This guy also heals his friends when he lands.  If he does a shock aura, but doesn't actually do damage to you, he's healing.

**CORROSIVE**: His name is Brood-something-or-other.  This guy spawns little dragons (handy for second winds), sometimes green weapons).

**FIRE**: This guy is a sumabitch.  I can't/haven't been able to tell *what* he offers to the rest of the Dragons, in a circular pattern, coming up through the floor.  Breathes fire ***A LOT***, and will also put his wings in front of himself. When he folds his wings up like that, and listen/read closely...

###STOP. SHOOTING. ANYTHING.

Those wings now *reflect* damage back to you.  Any damage. Bullets, Turrets.  Just stop.

EDIT: I used a Shock-O-Negative on this asshole last night

Now that we have the baddies listed

****

###The Gear

****

So the first thing you wanna do, Sirens).  My group of four decided after the 20th try, ""Hey... Let's try the *Hoplite*.""

Worked like a charm.  All four of us rarely went down

The Hoplite drops from Pyro Pete (the Invincible) from the Campaign of Carnage DLC

The next thing we did, but there's no noticeable 'slag' marking.  We had Turrets that were slagging for us, so... I dunno. 

Now

****

###HERE

****

First thing that happens after starting the fight, whatever one you shoot at/hit first, will be the one who *lands*.  So ***DON'T*** drop any robots/turrets at the start of this fight.

First one up that you wanna bring down is Shock.  He heals his buddies

Next one after this should be Fire.  He does the most damage to you

After that, he'll already be a 67/68, so it'll take some time.  But he'll spawn little dragons, allowing you to get some kill skills to help take this guy down.

Finally, and you should be fine.

****

### Conclusion

****

Is this the best set of strategy/info for this? No

Your reward for killing this Monstrosities is a fuck-ton of D20 chests

Have fun!

Is your game getting stale because your character is at max level with a lot of great loot? Do enemies seem to just die at your feet from a few shots from your amped conference call? 

If any of those rhetorical questions applied to you

THINGS YOU WILL NEED:
---

1. [Gibbed's Borderlands 2 Save Editor](http://www.se7ensins.com/forums/threads/borderlands-2-save-editor-revision-125.798767/)

2. Borderlands 2 Save File

HOW TO MAKE THE GAME HARDER:
---
[1. Extract and Open Gibbed's Borderlands 2 Save Editor]

[2. Open the borderlands save (.sav) file you wish to edit]

[3. Head on over to the ""raw"" tab in the save editor]

[4. Scroll Down the page until you reach the value listed as ""RegionGameStages"" and click on ""(collections)"" to its right.]

[5. Once clicked

[6. Take notice of the left pane

[7. Click on a RegionGameStageData entry and alter its ""GameStage"" value to something greater than 50. The enemies in that region will then spawn at the listed level. (Missions for that region will also scale accordingly)]

EXAMPLES OF FUN STAGES TO EDIT:
---
""GD_GameStages.Zone3.ThresherRaid""

This region controls what level Terramorphous the Invincible spawns at. When setting his level remember that the game will automatically spawn him 2 levels higher than the region stage (setting him to 50 will have him spawn at 52 etc). Try setting this to 65 (This is the highest i've tried

""GD_GameStages.Zone3.FinalBoss""

This region controls what level The Warrior spawns at. 

HOW TO RE-ACCEPT PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED MISSIONS:
---
[1. Extract and Open Gibbed's Borderlands 2 Save Editor]

[2. Open the borderlands save (.sav) file you wish to edit]

[3. Head on over to the ""raw"" tab in the save editor]

[4. Scroll Down the page until you reach the value listed as ""MissionPlaythroughs"" and click on ""(collections)"" to its right.]

[5. Once clicked

[6. Take notice of the left pane

[7. Click on the middle MissionPLaythroughData entry (it should be listed with a PlayThroughNumber value of ""1"" (tvhm playthrough)]

[8. Once the appropriate MissionPlaythroughData is selected

[9. Another Collection Editor Window will open up listing on the left pane all the Missions you have completed. Simply click on the ""MissionData"" entry you want to replay and delete the entry from the list using the red "" X "" button/icon in the collection editor.]

[10. Mission titles are listed in the ""MissionData"" entries as ""Mission"" followed by the appropriate string (example: GD_Z3_RobotSlaughter.M_RobotSlaughter_1) ]

Your bro want to play skyrim while you borderlands it up? No problem! Girlfriend want to play portal while you play TF2? No worries!

I got it working last night using Sandboxie and IndieVolume.   
 


Startup one version of borderlands using a shortcut, Y position, and the controller offset (a.k.a. use player 1 controller or player 2 controller {referring to Xbox controllers}). 


What I use for Player 1 (-AlwaysFocus -ControllerOffset=1)

What I use for Player 2 (-AlwaysFocus -SaveDataId=2 -WindowPosX=0 -WindowPosY=0)

Then start another version of borderlands outside of sandboxie. You can also add the -AlwaysFocus, I didn't actually need these on this version. I also settled on one person gets the controller, the other uses mouse and keyboard.  

 One of your steam sessions will go into offline mode. This is ok. You will be playing LAN anyway. 

Also, the other gets the speakers, but I finished this at midnight last night.

**-- .NET Fix --**

When you first start Borderlands 2 through Steam you will have a .NET repairer or installer. When it is finished it will say you need to restart your computer. Just click ""RESTART LATER"" and the BL2 splash screen will come up.

To prevent it from doing this on every start up through Steam you will want to go to your Steam Library, Select Verify Integrity of Game Cache... It should find 1 file missing and fix that file...

You will not need to restart your computer through this entire process.... Hopefully this will stay near the top or get stickied for the wave of people having issues as they get home from work/school later today...


**-- Alternative .NET Fix --**

u/epsiblivion has posted a folder permissions issue that may very well help everyone... 

&gt;I HAVE FOUND A FASTER WAY TO FIX THE .NET PROBLEM

&gt;on gearbox forum the guy says to go the your install folder and make it not read-only. do this by

&gt; - going to C:\program files\steam\steamapps\common and right click on borderlands 2.
&gt; - click on properties
&gt; - uncheck read-only under attributes
&gt; - click ok
&gt; - now relaunch the game
&gt; - .net should update one more time
&gt; - game launches after without asking for restart.
&gt; - quit game. relaunch. no .net update.
&gt; - play BL2

I was thinking that Zer0 must be one of the Erirdians since he is skinny and has 4 fingers but the reason he has (looks like he has) 4 fingers is because he is wearing sniper glove.

Contest:
Basically make me happy, draw something, show me your (man)boobs, I don't care.  If it makes me laugh or inspires me or what have you, if I like it, I'll give you the copy.  The only thing I ask is please leave this for people who are not fortunate enough to buy the game on their own.  I don't want to give this copy away because someone wanted to save 50$, I want to give someone this copy because I want to help someone who's YEARNING for this game but can't play and is in agony waiting.  That's who I want to help.

I'm just wanting to do a fun thing

Edit:  Hey guys, isn't just to feel good, it's three-fold.

I'm doing this because of Karma, it feels good to give.  Lastly, and the main reason why I'm doing this, is because of *Randy Fuckin Pitchford.*  He is a glorious human being, he's doing everything right.  Gearbox is making this generation's Diablo 2.  Not to mention just the Borderlands series, but they are making a CANONICAL SEQUEL to Aliens!!  Plus with the eulogy and the wedding announcement, Gearbox *really* cares about the community.  I can see that, you can see they are genuine.  I feel safe that ACM is going to be an absolute blockbuster of a game

**Destroy tough enemies**, bosses, and anything with a pulse very quickly. Groups are a touch harder to deal with but unloading 2 guns into an enemy's face will take them down very very fast. I never worried about bosses, not a one even gave me a challenge with the gunzerker. 

**Combos!** Using a slag SMG &amp; Corrosive shotgun was one of my most devastating combos

**Shield, and this is super handy when running low on ammo. Just duck behind some cover while gunzerking and come back out ready to fight. This is also a good trick if you need to pick a teammate up who is surrounded by enemies. 

**Never think about ammo**, thus a 2 round shotgun could dish out 3, 4, even as high as 10 rapid fire shots before i actually had to reload.

 We came here to study the Flora and Fauna of this frighteningly diverse world

The average psycho is imbued with an above average metabolism, I began to form a hypothesis on the origins of their psychosis. My idea is that a combination of their singular diet and the New-U system has caused a modified version of Kuru to evolve on this planet, specifically within the brain of the psycho. As we all know Kuru is a prion based condition, a form of Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, similar to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). All variations of these types of conditions cause massive neurological and psychological changes to occur within the patient (Kuru being anecdotally referred to as the laughing sickness). 

All forms of Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, who consumed human brain tissue. Upon contracting Kuru they expired, and were brought back using New- U technology, allowing variations of the prions to incubate within a host for unprecedented amounts of time. Essentially, the prions were regenerated, along with the individual, eventually allowing the prions to mutate into a “Human-stable” form. At this point, an unfortunately familiar site to any who have been here before.

1375633971.0,1jop4i,So just how hard will enemies be at level 72? Bahroo explains.,NOTHESPIKEYAVENGER,138,25,149,"I was going through the gearbox forums

He has found out

Later experimentation showed that the blue line for player health in the cool but scary graph heycarnut made was based on an inaccurate constant from the wiki. Based on the scaling values of 1.13/1.141 which appear to be empirically correct based on testing by Bahroo

1.13^(72-61) = 3.84
1.141^(72-61) = 4.27

So, damage and HP values at L72, multiply the L61 values by the following constants:

Things related to player damage or health: 3.84
Things related to enemy damage or health: 4.27

Normalizing the mob power increase to player power increase tells us how much ""harder"" it should be

tl;dr
it will seem about 12% more difficult to kill a given enemy than at L61.
you will be hit about 12% harder than you were at 61.

This is all assuming everything stays like it is now for scaling

To see the graphs they talk about, and your health and shields barely scale at all. Terra will have 11 BILLION HEALTH.  Master Gee will have 40 BILLION HEALTH.  This is getting pretty ludicrous, huh?  

In my opinion

So If UVHM was hard for you

Tl;Dr  Prepare for some tough enemies at 72.

1350921291.0,11weob,Challenge: Is Jack right?,Digiko,166,52,140,"It occurred to me that Jack genuinely believes he's the good guy because we're all bad guys.  People joke when in the Zelda games, he's a criminal.  We're no better.  Someone spent the time and effort to lug a giant chest with guns and relics onto the top of a building's roof or into a locked jail cell

So the challenge is this: do not open any chests or boxes (that's stealing) and do not kill anyone unless they aggro you first (IE self defense).  You can take items given to you (like quest rewards or Claptrap's first gun) and you can buy stuff from vending machines with earned money.  I'm a little unsure on collecting stuff off dead bodies if you had to kill them in self defense... would that be looting?  You can't help picking up ammo and cash since that's automatic.

I was just wondering if it would be possible,False,self,t5_2r8cd,False,,,t3_11weob

In the bit where you get into place to glitch into the wall (immediately before he goes up) you only have to push forward and jump.

It takes a little practice to get the hang of but once you master it you can get to 14 or so chests in 5 minutes. Feel free to ask any questions if you're having trouble.
