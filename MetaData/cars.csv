By Rex8499

Summary: In an effort to explain how torque and horsepower in cars are related, I’ve written this in hopes that semi-intelligent people might be able to get at least a rudimentary grasp of the concepts at play. If you aren’t already familiar with how an engine works, you’ll need to start there before trying to read this. Engines are very complicated, and these explanations are simplified, but accurate. There are many other factors at play that I will not delve into here today. Be patient while reading through all of this. You need to understand the basics before getting to the good stuff.

**Torque:** 

At it's most basic level
Torque = (force applied perpendicular) x (length of the arm the force is being applied on.)  

See Picture:  [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/lsbr7) 

Hand A is pulling with a force of 20 lbs downward

Torque A = (20 lbs) x (1ft) = 20ft-lbs
Hand B is twice as far out

Torque B = (10 lbs) x (2ft) = 20ft-lbs.

You'll need to keep this in mind when working on a car.  Often a bolt will be too tight, or put a piece of pipe over the handle to make a longer handle, you can exert more torque on the bolt without working so hard.  Or in that case, work as hard as you did the first time, but exert a lot more torque, and hopefully enough to loosen the bolt.  One of the tools I carry in my toolbox is a piece of pipe for just this purpose.
Let's look inside an engine for a second. When the combustion happens inside, which pushes down on the offset of the crankshaft. If you can imagine the center of the crankshaft like the bolt, and the offset arm of the crankshaft as the wrench, and the piston and connecting rod as your arm trying to push down. You're applying a twisting force (a torque) to the axis of the crankshaft. 

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/qrUOU) 

In that photo
Depending on how big the cylinder is, and ultimately the crankshaft arm, varies. Engines burning more gas can push down harder and create higher torque. Multiply this torque by the number of cylinders, giving even more torque overall for a big V8 engine vs just 4 cylinders.

**Horsepower:** 

A unit of measurement for work. Back in the day

 [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/51NXg) 

If you have a 2000 lb Ferrari, the Ferrari will get there faster (aka, shorter time), it has more power. Power =  (work/time). But you will have done the same amount of work with each car. You’d burn the same amount of gas with each car (here in the ivory halls of acadamia, we’re assuming equal efficiencies as well). The Ferrari can do more work in a shorter time, but it cannot do more work in a set distance.

Horsepower is just a unit of measurement to compare how much work that engine can do over time. How many times per second an engine makes that torque determines horsepower. An engine that wasn't spinning could still be making torque without making any power at all. Just like you can apply torque to a rusted bolt, you're making some power.

When looking at a dyno graph, and requires torque in ft-lbs and RPM listed as ""X000.""

Horsepower = (Torque x RPM) / 5252 

As such, the Horsepower will be low.

Or, you could still have a large horsepower number.

If you’ve got the big V8 engine, so the horsepower number in the higher RPMs is limited compared to a motor that could maintain a good torque curve to 10k RPM.

With the small 4-cylinder engine, so the horsepower could still be as high as the big V8 with more torque. If you look at some of the formula one race cars, they often have very small engines that don’t have a huge amount of torque, but they rev to 18k RPM, so their horsepower is crazy high.

So

At lower speeds, so the horsepower is low because less overall work is being done. As the engine RPM's increases past its most efficient point and peak in the torque curve, the torque decreases for each revolution (I’ll explain why later on). However, it's making that torque more times per minute, so the horsepower starts to increase. Even though it's making less force per revolution, it's revolving (and firing) more times per minute, so the overall work being done is greater
Continued in comments...

Edit 1: clarifying when torque decreases.

Edit 2: clarifying that engines do make power.

Edit 3: Wording

Edit 4: Based on all of the great feedback, so don't be looking for it for at least a few months. I'll post a link and on here once I'm done. But this time it won't be out of the goodness of my own heart. You'll have to pay a small fee for this one. I'll set it up as an electronic book through amazon or something.

I recently had to sell my Wrangler as it was totally impractical with kids so we needed something beefy that would tow the boat and safely transport my boys. She's had her heart set on a BMW X5 for years now and with our $13000 in cash I figured we could get a great used one with a decent engine and tow package.

After looking for a few weeks, old lady driven, immaculate shape, 4.4l V8. Did I mention it was $4500 below KBB?

Of course

Previously

* The first mechanic couldn't figure it out. They replaced the spark plugs

* The second dealership she took it to was convinced it was a head gasket issue and said she'd be better off replacing the engine with BMW.

* The BMW dealership said the head gasket was fine

Before making the 5 hour trek, there was no valve tick/detonation I could hear. She checked her coolant and oil and both were clear. She just had an oil change done and there was no milky residue anywhere.

This was odd to me so I went off to research the issue on the various BMW forums. I found a few posts made from people over the years that said if they only drive it short distances

I called the lady back  and I asked her HOW the miles were put on. She said she frequently drove it a mile or two to work and rarely used it on the highway (explaining the low miles).

Bingo.  I told her that I may know the solution. She honestly didn't believe me that it was a cheap fix. She didn't want to hear it. She was sick of it and it needed to go. Great - I'll drive over the next day.

I knew it was going to be a gamble

Sure enough

That was 1 month and 2, but [here's a quick shot of my gamble that paid off.](http://i.imgur.com/Ay2sp3C.png)

1365546540.0,1c0rzo,The story of how I had my dream car ...and lost it a week later. (Honda S2000) (Pics),cscolley,1122,282,812,"I've wanted a Honda S2000 for years. I've owned an Acura RSX since 2008, bills

A few times a week, noticing that as the miles went up and the cars got older, the value didn't drop much. Yep, these things really hold their value, which was bad for me.

Until a few weeks ago, with perfect interior/exterior, good top, new tires, upgraded Honda alarm system, and perfect running engine; for $11,000. I thought to myself: Could this be it? This might actually be obtainable. Sure


After the lengthy process of switching banks, making my down payment using the money from my ""S2000 Fund"", and making the 6 hour drive again to pick the car up, I finally had her. She was all mine!

Here's a shot of us getting gas just outside of Birmingham
http://i.imgur.com/LVXROWH.jpg

 Because I had managed to save up for a decent down payment, I told my girlfriend she could sell her time bomb Pontiac Grand Am and drive my RSX. She was ecstatic. She always loved my car, and now it was hers. For that first week she ""felt like a boss"" driving it to work.

Two days later
http://i.imgur.com/otqWqNv.jpg

Then

I had taken my girlfriend to the doctor's that morning, I fed the car some gas, and that's when it happened...

I had failed to notice a build-up of loose dirt/gravel on the edge of the road. When I tried to accelerate out of the turn, pointing the tires in the direction I wanted to go. (This is where my ignorance to real wheel drive came into play.) Had I feathered the gas and kept the wheel pointed, I may have been able to save it. I may have run off the road, or even spun out, but that's it. I let off the gas, and as soon as I did, the rear end swung around

We slammed head-first into a '98 Toyota 4Runner. Everyone always says ""It happened so fast"" and it's true. One second my tires are screeching, followed by smoke and the sound of two car horns blaring. I asked my girlfriend if she was alright, and all she said was ""Your car."" I repeated: ""ARE YOU OKAY?"" and she shook her head yes.

Not sure whether the smoke was from the airbags or the engine, the realization of what had happened hit me. The driver of the 4Runner stepped out. I asked if he was OK, and gave me no answer but a dirty look; a look I knowingly deserved.

First view upon stepping out:
http://i.imgur.com/6pzPmBM.jpg

We stood there in the road while the police did their job, shock and disbelief.

Here's the ""money-shot"" of the damage:
http://i.imgur.com/E2irORM.jpg

I took this picture right as we left the scene:
http://i.imgur.com/ljIUB3t.jpg

The truth is... insurance will probably cover what I owed on the loan and if I'm lucky I'll break even. But of course my insurance premiums will skyrocket. I had to ""take back"" my old RSX from my girlfriend

If you take anything from this story, no matter how nice of a day it may be, and know the limits of your car, no matter how good a driver you think you are.

What I listed as a Ferrari 360 is actually a 430.  We're still not sure what the old grey one is...either the incredibly rare 500 Superfast

The Sting Ray is a '66

The red F100 is a 1957-1960.

In 2011 I got a call from a guy building a classic rendition of the modern Corvette ZR1. Not only did they shoehorn the LS9 engine and six-speed transmission into a '63 split window Corvette, and chassis bits as well.

But what really makes this car over-the-top for me is the interior. Corvettes have never had great interiors, the best-looking car I've done a photo shoot of.

Kinda just threw this album together, but constructive criticism is still always welcomed.

Since I'm really into photography of course I brought my camera and a couple lenses with. Before the meeting we could just walk around the dealer and look at whatever. After the meeting me and a couple buddies asked some guys who worked there if we could go inside the service bay to look around

Now

Inside the main showroom were four different seats, wheels, and steering wheels on display.

All I learned in my Driver's Ed class (also in a public, and push the little skinny pedal on the right.""

Some background for Americans: The LJ Torana is a small aussie-built sedan packing a straight 6. It's famous for being driven by Peter Brock (our most famous driver) and winning Bathurst (our most famous race) against the V8s.

I bought this car for $1000 when I was 15 years old with the plan of restoring it with my dad and using it as my first car. I had no experience with cars, stripping a car is MUCH easier than putting it back together!

So after 10 years (mostly sitting dormant in the shed)

I thought /r/cars might enjoy a bit of Australian inspiration!

I plan to begin a series of posts covering all topics related to driving and cars. I hope to not only bring some knowledge to new car enthusiasts

**WHAT IS A POWERSLIDE?**

[Gif 1](http://24.media.tumblr.com/3ead1cf7ba92fbcc70f3bbdfb718a1c4/tumblr_ml22j9tCsn1rpdptuo1_500.gif)

[Gif 3](http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18gk8ltqx2ah3gif/k-bigpic.gif)

Powersliding is a technique used to maneuver around corners while still maintaining forward momentum. The technique involves going through the first half of the turn normally

Note: This is a general description of powersliding. Some cars do not need the wheel to be cut 180 degrees. Much of powersliding depends on the car, and the weather conditions.

**HOW DO I POWERSLIDE?**

*I must first take a moment to say that if you do attempt to powerslide

1. Enter a turn as normal. Make sure to follow the best line around the turn

2. As you pass through the apex, you can dip the clutch just a bit. 

3. The key to properly executing the turn is to recognize when to let go of the gas. **Once the nose of the car completes the turn and points in the direction you want to go

4. Once traction is regained

[Quick video tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=GDbY6XsMGug#t=63s) (not 100% accurate but close enough)

**WHERE CAN I PRACTICE POWERSLIDING?**

Parking lots are usually the place people go, and desolate roads are great too. 

**DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POWERSLIDING AND DRIFTING**

This is the debatable topic. Avid drifters will tell you that there is a HUGE difference between drifting and powersliding. Others will say that powersliding is a type of drifting. Mainly, many drift enthusiasts are kind of snobby against powersteering. They see it as whimpy/amateurish 

**FACTORS THAT WILL AFFECT YOUR POWERSLIDE**

These characteristics are favorable in powersliding:

- More HP. The more

- Limited Slip Differential

**ARE THERE ANY ADVANTAGES TO POWERSLIDING?**

Not really. They are mostly for show/fun. There are much more effective ways to handle turns in a race. 

____

Welp, and input. My next post will either be about rotary engines or the aforementioned Limited Slip Differential.",,False,,t5_2qhl2,False,,

Growing up, Manitoba, Canada. Originally, there was just a log house, then two barns, then a potato barn, two guest houses, numerous cars came and went, an LTD

Over time, the two guest houses are also collapsing, and my grandmother built a new house. But the building that remained was the garage.

I always knew SOMETHING was in that garage, get in through the door, or properly understand the significance of discovering an old car. Last year (May 2012 specifically) my best friend's dad finally finished his 1965 Corvair Corsa. Red. Gorgeous. *Convertible*. One day they swung by my house and I got a ride. I instantly fell in love with the sound of the engine, the wind in your hair (I had some magnificent blond locks then, still do) and looking up at a canopy of trees shadowing my home street. I decided I had to know what was in that garage.

Come June 2012. I broke open the door of the garage. Forced the car door open and let the light in. What the light struck was a 1969 Pontiac Firebird 350 Convertible in Sunburst Red. Now

Anyways, they all lived in there at one point) colony, and that the exhaust system was *literally* a neat pile of rust sitting on the floor of his shop (but since he deals with 20 year old YJs, TJs, and the like, I thought he'd be used to that).

Fast forward a year of work for him (mostly) and another dreary year of EvDs at the UofM for me, new MSD distributor and ignition, Edelbrock intake, and QFT 4 barrel 650 carb. Paired with a shiny new pair of stainless steel magnaflow tips, mufflers, etc. Long story short, is the thing now pumps out close enough to 400 horsepower *ON THE ORIGINAL RADIALS* (which miraculously still hold air and have plenty of tread) and sucks gas like nothing else I've ever experienced.

Took my grandmother for a ride in it, it's got showmanship. I'll fix that sometime.

TL;DR. Screw you

**note** I bet some are assuming that ""I'm the stereotypical rich kid acting like he knows about cars"". Half right. I'm NOT rich in anyway. I spent every summer since I was 14 saving money from various jobs I did to use for the right moment. I know a BIT about cars, or because of my personal lack of knowledge (because I want it to be done RIGHT, but learn along the way)

Here's my story.",klinquist,488,126,http://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1a9pfp/psh_you_went_to_the_nürburgring_my_rental_car_was/, Denmark on a business trip and had a free weekend.  Figuring that I would never again get the opportunity to be so close, and drove the world-famous Nordschliefe.    I had literally done my first track day (at Thunderhill Raceway in Northern California) two weeks prior to that first visit.  I met up with an individual on the ""ringers"" mailing list (based in the UK) who took me for a very exciting lap in his wife's Renault Clio 172 before I jumped in my rental BMW 320dT/6MT  (that's a 2.0L Diesel wagon with a 6 speed manual gearbox for those that don't speak bimmerease) and did three laps.   I gave the remaining two laps on my 5 lap ticket to an American soldier I saw in a yellow Cavalier entering the track.  I had the flu during that week and just couldn't do another lap.
 

Back to the instant message - my friend was asking me about the 'ring because he found that Continental was offering $99 each way from Newark, I browsed to continental.com and booked myself on the same flights.  I then called a friend of mine that lives locally and he did the same.    I can pay for my own way to Newark - a $276 round trip (incl. taxes) to the 'ring can not and will not be passed up.
 


My wife (now ex-wife) was not pleased that I had not called her prior to purchasing this ticket. 



April rolled around and I boarded my redeye flight from San Jose to Newark where I had a 12 hour layover.   Took the PATH train into Manhattan and met up with the 3 others from NYC for lunch then eventually headed back to the airport.
 
Another red-eye flight and we land in Köln.   We had two rental cars beween the 5 of us - my buddy and I reserved a ""BMW 3-series or equivalent"" and ended up with an Audi A6 Avant 2.7 Auto (big diesel wagon with an an automatic) and the 3 guys from NYC that reserved a ""BMW 1-series or equivalent"" ended up with an Audi A3 1.9 6MT (small diesel hatchback with a 6 speed manual).   It was Easter weekend and apparently all they had for us were these Audis (and no manuals in my class- lame!).   I opted in to the cheapest insurance option

 
We booked the first two nights at a hotel in Amsterdam
 


Some more background - I had been subscribed to the ""ringers"" mailing list and read Ben Lovejoy's web site many times (http://www.nurburgring.org.uk/).    I knew that rental car companies typically did not allow you on the 'ring.   I also knew that in Germany, you were typically charged for repair/replacement, no matter how minor.    I had been on the track before in a rental, I had decided to do it again (""rent a racer"" rentals do exist, but they cost 2-3x more than airport rentals, for obvious reasons).
 


On the second day, so I jump in the back seat.   ""K"" was driving ... he came around a corner a little too hot and slid off the track.  The entire right side of the car hit the armco, slamming my head against the side glass in the process.     I did what any responsible person would have done:  yelled ""GO!!!!!!!""
 


""K"" did just that, I was watching people's heads - seeing if anyone would be looking at the side of our car.  After all, I had not yet seen the damage, and the car was still driving OK...
 


When we parked I noticed there were many small dents just in front of and behind the wheels.  There was a single long shallow dent all along the side of the car.  Paint was scraped off of the wheels.
 
For the most part
 


The nervousness built as we entered the airport for our flight home.   When we checked the rental car back in
 


A few weeks later, of course, had a spot for a police report #.   I stated that I had hit a pole in a parking garage in Amsterdam... an accident which was witnessed by the parking garage owner, who waved us on by.     Sounded like a good story to me, and it explains why we didn't have a police report.  I returned the form via fax.
 


Another few weeks go by and I received a large envelope from the rental car agency.  It stated that since we did not make a police report, I'd be on the hook.


 
Before we went down that route
 


Nearly six weeks go by and I finally receive another letter from the rental agency.   They concluded that I was correct and that I only owed 950 Euro (pretty shitty business practice trying to intimidate the uninformed).   ""K"" sent me a check for the full amount ($1350US) and I forwarded it off to the rental agency.       
 


Lots of lessons learned.... and thank you for being a stand-up guy

2004 Honda S2000 with a few personal extras and some tweaks here and there.


STORY: I bought this car during the winter break of my Senior Year in High school. Was working part-time during the year and full-time during the summers at DQ. I also tutored part-time as well as worked in a local mechanic shop until I finally saved enough to buy her. YES, sweat, and tear. Didn't get a single penny from my parents, in fact, they didn't know that I had all this money saved up. I bought the car without telling them from a private owner and kinda just showed up with it at home that night. They were furious and extremely confused at first, until I gave each of them a ride haha.

Czech web site says 1190kg (2624lb) - not bad.

Edit: 

&gt; boasts a wheelbase that's a full 2.4 inches longer than the outgoing model
 
&gt; under the hood

&gt; features a chassis that's a full 30-percent stiffer than the 2013 model thanks in part to extensive use of high-strength steel.

&gt; the material also let **Mazda cut around 200 pounds from the vehicle**

**EDIT 2 WITH SOME PURCHASING INFO** So I got a hold of my dad, he told me that if you send him a message on his ebay store with my username, he can get you some kind of discount. His ebay store is NOT up yet, he said it should be up by the end of the week. I'll post a link here or in a new thread regarding the store link. Thanks for your support everyone, maybe this will net me a new toolbox from him for Christmas. Any further questions, either ask here or PM me. 

**EDIT 3 PLEASE READ ME IF YOU ARE IGNORING EVERYTHING ELSE PLEASE**: To help out making things easier, there will be a new thread posted as soon as my dad's ebay store goes online. For those of you still expressing legal concerns, my dad's store itself does NOT sell any automotive related signs. You will have to get in contact with him to work out the details, but please have a logo set up for him. He's the only one making these signs.

*Edit* 
added a Dyno Chart. The dashed line is the power at the wheels. The solid line is the power made without boost modulation. The EGR circuit is not on P28 ECU's

It took 2 years and uncountable hours

I started with a 1991 Civic SI that was totaled, I surprise people on the road often. 

*Edit*
I forgot to mention the remote start. I made a cell phone activated remote start that starts the car by calling the phone IED style. There is a picture of it up there now. One of my friends put the number for the phone in a craigslist ad as a practical joke on me. the car was starting constantly. I have taken measures to prevent this now by block all phone numbers but mine.
