1359240530.0,17c6jx,How-To Practice; a Guide,ghoti023,145,7,19,"Practice is one of the most important parts of becoming a good singer. Singing well requires developing muscle memory so that you can focus more on performing and less on the technical aspects to make your performances stronger.

For those new-ish to singing

For starters, for most kinds of singing, an hour a day is more than enough. If you're singing something a little bit more challenging, it's possible that more practice will be required a day. Even then, one should not practice for more than three hours a day. The vocal folds need rest, and singing is less about how long you sing, and more about how frequent you sing. Practicing twice a day for 15-30 minutes will do you better than singing an equal amount of time in one sitting. It's all about muscle memory.

And now- what to practice and how.

**BREATHING**
There are lots of good breathing exercises out there (if you have a chance

**WARM UP**
Everyone has their favorite warm-ups. If you're new

* Lip trills on a scale (that motor-boating sound you can make with your lips)
* Onsets. Take a single note. Sing one vowel. take a breath. Sing another vowel on the same note, aaahh, oh, oooo). The object of this is to be able to sing each vowel cleanly, with no scooping or hard [glottals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edxwQK1zBxw&amp;t=1m30s), and in tune.
* Scales or other melodic exercises (do, do, or other similar things) on vowels or voiced consonants (like v, z, m, n etc...)
* Sing intervals/scales to simply practice intonation.
* [Here's a list of some other good stuff.](http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/singing-exercises-for-dummies-cheat-sheet.html)

**WORK ON THE SONG/S**
Start with a run-through of each song you're working on. Use this run-through to identify parts that you aren't so happy with that you can pick apart. Do you have trouble reaching the end of a phrase? Are there some notes you have trouble hitting or getting in tune? Is there a place where you'd wish you'd have had some better dynamic contrast? Was there a spot where your tone wasn't consistent with what you wanted?  Be really really picky. Mindlessly singing through songs will not get you very far if you don't think about how you want to make them better.

Now take all of those things that you want to do better, or google, or this subreddit, or a friend, and ask. Don't just let it go. If you don't know the answer, find it. 

After you work on the individual aspects

90% of being a good singer is having critical thinking skills and being able to take apart your own performance and know exactly what you want to fix. If you don't know what to fix (or how) because you're clueless as to where to start

I have been pretty active in this subreddit for about 8 (? possibly more) months now. Around here you tend to see a lot of the same threads show up every couple weeks or so, they tend to be this kind of thing:

- How can I scream/hard rock sing?
- Lost my voice
- What songs should I use for an audition?
- Can't afford voice lessons
- Just started singing

Now, /u/afrael , /u/taylorishere , etc. (I know I missed a *lot* of people, sorry) but the last question in particular has always bugged me. For one, the question of ""range"" is very complicated and is actually - as I see it - several other questions in disguise. My attempts to think of this left me with the following questions/problems:

- ""How can I expand my range?""
- ""Why can't I sing to *x* note?""
- ""Will I ever be able to sing to *x* note?""
- ""I want to be like/literally embody *x* singer
- ""I used to be able to hit *x* note

...and lastly the occasional (rare around here

- I have an *x* octave range

The problem that I have with range is that I find most newcomers put *way* too much emphasis on increasing their range

------------------

The art of singing is fundamentally broken up into two categories: *technique* and *musicianship*. These can mean very different things for very different styles of music but the most crossover between all styles lies in technique. Technique contains things like:

- breathing and support
- phonation
- resonance
- ridding the body of muscular stress (Alexander Technique

*(as you may have guessed

Whereas musicianship contains things like:

- Diction
- Phrasing
- Ornamentation
- Improvisation
- Singing-Acting (generally described to me as *intention*
- Characterization (more common in certain styles than others)

*N.B. The line between technique and musicianship is not truly so cut and dry and the more training you do the more you see them blend together.*

You may have already experienced this phenomenon in your lessons with your teacher. Typically

-------------------------

***""Range"" as an example of ego-boosting***

When it comes to a singers range, just as a large penis by no means equals competent lover, large range by no means equals great singer.

Most of the repertoire is not written for people with huge ranges in mind and even if you are someone who has a smaller-than average range, having great sense of rhythm, articulation, enmeshment, improvisation, and selling what they were singing? ""But CrAzY_MoFo_13,"" you might say, doesn't that prove that bigger range = better artist?"" The problem with using this argument is that we only know of the singers that have large ranges and are *also* competent musicians, look at the giant body of repertoire written to be performed by the amateur singer;* these songs almost never require a total range of more than an octave and a fifth

**This practice was fairly common until the mid-twentieth century where amateur singing fell out of fashion

The next issue I see with people's ranges is the tendency for people to ""round up"" as it were with their extreme ranges. By ""round up"", but the main problems I find are universal are the following:

- Notes forced out in these extreme ranges are generally only made because of extreme stress on the vocal cords and are therefore **dangerous and damaging**
- If you sing in a style where you don't use amplification these notes can almost never project properly
- These notes are often there some days/time of the day
- These notes are almost never useable in actual music

To expand on that last point. High and low notes have a tendency - even when done with good technique behind them - to be more easily produced on certain vowels than others, the more extreme this becomes until you can only phonate that note on a certain vowel, or often just a squeak or growl that doesn't sound like *any* vowel at all.

** *This practice is equivalent to* coloratura *in* bel canto *style or melismas in pop style*

Regardless of a style

---------------------------------

***New singers and their range***

When it comes to new singers and their range, etc. This is not uncommon, but it is something that we all have to work through; just because you can't sing it *now* doesn't necessarily mean it's not there. The voice is a set of muscles and just as you can't walk into a gym on day 1 and bench 300 lbs, you won't be able to utilize your body's full potential without a lot of training and practice. For many people the vast majority of their time vocalizing is done through speech, and depending on the culture, this often means the voice is using a very small tonal range in its daily use. Singing will therefore feel foreign to the muscles of the voice when you first start out, they will be unresponsive in certain ways and will tire easily in others. Just remember to keep at it *safely* and *properly* and eventually you will be able to utilize the full potential of your voice (this will most likely take years

Since the good majority of our subreddit seems to be young people (including myself), that's because voices keep maturing long after the peak of most of the rest of the body, men will not become mature in voice until at least 30 years old! Beyond that, if you're under the age of 18 your voice is most likely currently going through the huge changes of puberty or has *just* completed them so you can't expect your voice to be anywhere near what your mature voice will be. However, it is always good to keep training and singing, just know that you're not superhuman.

------------------------

***Conclusion / TL;DR***

So, and focus on increasing your range often causes musicianship (which is much more important IMO) to fall by the wayside. In addition, young people still have growing voices that will be growing well into their adult lives and teenagers are just babies in the voice and should not be concerned with range.

Because singing is such an illogical art in many ways (thinking of surprise will unconsciously raise up my soft palate, pure vowels, etc.) great singers are often painted in this mystical light as freaks of nature. Well, it is true that some people are just born with amazing biology and will be in the top 0.001% of singers, but guess what **if music relied on those freaks of nature, we would not have music as we have it today.** Even opera, that art form that always seems from afar as a special ""club"" for the vocal elite has roles written for amateur singers.

But how does this relate to you, think about it this way, the voice is a series of muscles, and muscles need to be exercised. But singing softly along to your favourite song on the radio is not exercise in the same way that bench-pressing 15 pounds is not exercise. When the muscles in your chest are pushed and challenged they will get tired, but the muscle will build itself back stronger to meet this new demand; too much push and the muscle can be seriously harmed, maybe even permanently. This is a lot less of metaphor to the voice than you think: the larynx will respond to new demands being put on it (in the right way, read on) and come back stronger and more ready, intercostals, or do *too much* and you can develop problems with the muscles inside.

Many people try to sing with no training, can't sustain a note, etc. and become immediately let down by the ""fact"" that they ""can't sing"". **This is bullshit**, you wouldn't feel bad that you can't pull a bus with your bare hands because some strongman who has been training 30+ years to do so can. I think part of this problem is a visual thing that, because we can't necessarily see what makes a great singer with our eyes, we just assume ""they're born with it"". **Nope**. Mariah Carey wasn't born with the ability to sing in that whistle register, Jussi Björling wasn't born with the ability to do what he did - they trained, with a ***teacher***. 

Finding a trained, many voice teachers who, frankly, don't know what the fuck they're talking about and will charge exorbitant amounts of money to tell you how great you whilst not doing anything productive. How can you tell? Well, for one, ask about and research the teacher's other students (particularly ones that have been there for a while), if they have many students who are/have gone on to be professional singers know for their great voices the teacher is probably doing something right, maybe the teacher is not so good. On a side note, mezzo, if they destroyed their own voice through mismanagement

So in conclusion, should I give up?"" My question is always the same: **Fuck No**. I apologize if profanity offends you but this is a situation where niceties aren't going to get us anywhere. The fact of the matter is, **your voice may not sound that great now, but that *does not mean you have nowhere to go*; every singer needs to train and you haven't even begun.** My advice, find a good voice teacher and stick with it, because the most important thing that a singer needs to be great is not a freakishly-great set of lungs or any of that stuff but **tenacity** and the ambition to become something better.

The first time you learn about diaphragmatic breathing usually involves people telling you to, the first thing that I've done once I saw ""breathe from your belly"" was trying to do it, don't! you should never force your breathing to be diaphragmatic, that is not how it works! You allow it to be! How, you may ask?

The first and easiest way is to lay down, now put your hand on your belly, you should see and feel it expand, if you don't, your forcing it or you're not relax (or you're not human), now that you know how it feels stand up or sit, it really doesn't matter, don't lean forward or slouch, just straight, breathe from your mouth

**Establishing a Correct Basic Technique for Singing**

**By Hermanus Baer**

Artistic

I believe the first step toward this ideal goal is to clarify cause and effect. Too often voice students and teachers deal entirely with the effect. The teacher observes that the student's jaw appears to be stiff. Now, I believe other vocal faults usually have an underlying cause. The real problem is not where it appears to be. To call the students attention to his stiff jaw is dealing with the effect and will probably make matters worse.

There are numerous examples of this faulty approach in teaching singing. One of the most prevalent is the incessant concentration on tone. I am convinced this works at cross purposes to good interpretation. In our speaking voices we express various emotions, pity, anger, etc., without thinking about tone. Instead, we think of the idea we wish to express. This idea colors our voices automatically and motivates the appropriate tone. The best tone is produced when we are not thinking about it. Naturally, this automatic response is able to succeed only to the degree that our technique will allow.

I believe learning to sing has much in common with the technique of learning to play golf, how to follow through with his body, proper stance, etc. At first he doesn't even use a ball. The golfer who is not willing to spend time on basic body mechanics is not likely to succeed. If he thinks instead only of where he wants the ball to go and assumes that eventually he will develop good control without any consideration for a basic technique, he is following the same course many voice students are following. The voice student who is completely absorbed in making ""tones"" is dealing with the effect. He may succeed in improving the tone somewhat, but he will probably produce this less offensive tone by inhibiting the tone. The attempt to ""color"" the tone artificially by manipulating the jaw, lips, etc.

When we sing a completely untrained, but a very thin, unmusical sound. Under these conditions, the main fault will surely be a closed throat. This thin tone can easily and readily be changed into a full, rich tone simply by changing the basic body so as to encourage an open throat.

I believe the automatically opened throat is one of the most important conditions for any singer, he states that practically all faults are a result of a closed throat - closed in one way or another- and the remedy for all is an open throat. He further states that every voice teacher should be judged primarily by his ability to induce a completely expanded throat for his students. All reputable vocal scientists seem to agree that the major resonator in the human voice is the pharynx, or throat cavity. If this be true, it behooves the voice teacher to find devices for encouraging the greatest possible expansion.

There are three factors that have a bearing on creating greater space in the throat: a raised soft palate; a forward position of the tongue, but will concentrate on purity of vowel. Under these conditions there should be no reason for the tongue to pull back into the throat. The raised soft palate may be encouraged by the thought of making an exclamation of surprise, or by the attitude of astonishment [Richard Miller’s “mild amusement”]. However, I find more and more that as the larynx is encouraged to drop lower in the throat through correct posture and correct breathing, the soft palate automatically moves upward. The larynx and soft palate always tend to move in opposite direction. Since this relationship exists, it is obvious that the low larynx is of basic importance. Dr. Wilhelm Ruth, a Berlin research scientist, moving upward or downward as the singers sang in all parts of their ranges. He used untrained singers, the larynx moved upward with each ascending note

I believe most voice teachers who are opposed to a low larynx object to it because they know only of the consciously lowered or depressed larynx. I don't know of anything more harmful than a consciously lowered larynx, in reality, they are closing the part of the throat of greatest importance to the singer. The greatest possible freedom of the throat is experienced by the singer who sings with an automatically lowered larynx, whereas considerable tension in the throat is invariably the result of a high larynx.

After placing so much stress on the automatically lowered larynx

I'm currently enrolled in a vocal performance program for opera. I don't have a degree in vocal pedagogy and I'm not a replacement for a voice teacher

The most common issue is breath support. I know this is mentioned in the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/singing) (as are a few other things I'm going to talk about) but I'd like to expand on what's already posted.

Your breath is the most important thing to your singing. Being connected to your breath is even more vital. Sit on the edge of a chair with your elbows on your knees. Take in a deep breath. Feel the expansion in your lower back? (Didn't know that was something you had to use did ya?) Now exhale with KEEPING the expansion. That's a little more work than most people are used to, but I'll get to that in a minute. Now take in a few deep breaths and exhale with the expansion but engage your lower abdominals. This should feel like you're doing an eternal crunch, and should have more pressure on it the less air you have in your lungs. WHOO! That's a workout. You can also get this effect by doing [short bursts of lip trills](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIqkfbEBEh0) feeling the energy come from your lower abs. Whenever anyone tells you to ""sing from your diaphragm,"" but you have no idea what that means- that's okay. Your diaphragm is actually an involuntary muscle, that simply separates your lungs from your intestines. you can pull down on it to allow more expansion and air into your lungs using your intercostal muscles (muscles that expand/contract the space between your ribs), your lower back muscles and your abdominals. This confused me for a long time, because instead of focusing on control from my abs, in which case all of my effort was lying too high up in the body. Your lower abs actually do most of the work. Your chest and shoulders should never move because you took a breath. All of the expansion in your lungs should feel as low as possible.

POSTURE! The only difference between sitting posture and standing posture is the use of your legs. If you're standing, your core is the most important part. ""Sitting/standing Tall"" is how most voice teachers go about explaining this, but here's the nitty gritty details. Your lower ribcage should feel expanded, your shoulders back. You should feel like at any given moment you'll be asked to chest bump a football player- that's how expanded your chest should be. Not tense! just expanded. Don't over extend your shoulders back either- that can be tricky too. Your neck should remain loose, but as though you were a marionette, and someone was pulling an invisible string towards the ceiling (essentially making your chin parallel to the ground). I cannot stress enough that this should all be relatively relaxed- just controlled. Tension is never a good thing.

Vocal freedom is *vital* to a singer. If your voice hurts after a song or two, not by trying to manipulate your voice box. If you try to sing from your throat rather than from your gut, you're risking giving yourself vocal nodes (calluses on  your chords. You never sound the same again, even if you get them removed), or you can actually paralyze a chord (this JUST happened to a colleague of mine) which takes an immense amount of therapy to fix. The voice is like a pretty sounding whoopee cushion. All of the work comes from the exhalation of air- and the vocal chords just do what the air tells them to do. A whoopee cushion doesn't make sound because you manually slap the flaps together, it makes a sound because there's a stream of air. Your voice is similar. Large culprits of ""singing from your throat"" tend to be musical theatre people who do a lot of belting. There's nothing wrong with belting, I do it on occasion myself- but you have GOT to use the right technique. Know why Idina Menzel had to take a long break? Too much improper belting in Wicked. You can seriously hurt yourself if you sing from the throat guys- I can't stress it enough. Of course, but so long as you have proper technique you'll be fine so long as you take a few hours to break. Plenty of professionals get vocal fatigue

Common with musical theatre and pop/rock singing is nasality. You don't want this. It's not going to hurt you like singing from your throat, keep pinching your nose while you sing to help yourself find a placement that is more desirable. 

RESONANCE! Resonance, is tricky and it doesn't work the same for everyone. Some people need more mouth resonance, others more mask, and others more chest. Mouth resonance is what projects your sound and makes it easy to hear. You DON'T have to sing at your loudest at all times, just use mouth resonance. It's easier on your chords and the audience will be able to hear you better than if you were shout-singing. Mask resonance is placed in the mask of the face (around where your sinus cavities are. Don't confuse this with singing through your nose though. They are two different things). Mask resonance will bring warmth to your voice. Many people try to accomplish warmth by swallowing their sound and keeping it in the back of their throat. This will only sound good to you- and be barely audible from an audience. Bring your sound forward and use mask resonance to warm your tone. Chest resonance makes your low notes audible. I'm sure most of you have felt chest resonance before, as it's the easiest one to obtain. As you're in your lower register, feel the vibrations coming out of your sternum. TADA! CHEST RESONANCE. The trick is that you can never JUST use chest resonance. There must always be a mix of all three resonances. Where you are in your vocal range determines what mixture you should use. The higher you get, the more chest. Mouth resonance should ALWAYS be a thing

Many singers have intonation or rhythm issues. For rhythm- practice with a metronome. You can find online metronomes with an easy google search. For intonation issues you need to determine whether or not you're hearing the right pitch or if there's a flaw in your technique. Many singers HEAR the right pitch in their head but the wrong one comes out because their technique needs work. Most of the time it's breath support or placement issues. Record and listen to yourself and be honest with yourself. Did you hit that right? Practice intonation by singing chromatic scales and intervals. There are plenty of online resources that can teach you how to do that as well.

Don't EVER try to sound older than you are or try to manipulate your sound so you can sound like someone else (at least, but do it YOUR way, not his way. There will be songs you can't do, or at least can't do as well as you'd like.

1363642618.0,1ajt7a,Recording FAQ,maestro2005,45,6,3,"In the past month or so, with a few asides for more general practices.

**The signal path**

To get from physical sound to an audio file on your computer

1) A microphone -- Converts the physical sound wave into an analog electrical signal.  This signal is incredibly weak
2) A preamplifier (a.k.a. preamp) -- Amplifies the mic level signal to *line level*
3) An audio interface -- Converts the analog line level signal to a digital signal

Fortunately, but aren't expandable if you want to use multiple mics--you can't plug two USB mics into two USB ports and use both of them at the same time.

**Recording software**

Audacity is free and perfectly fine for basic recording and editing.  If all you want to do is record something, it will be fine.  If you need too much more than that though, I would recommend Reaper instead.

Pro Tools is the industry standard.  If you're thinking about going into music production professionally, it's just a matter of ease of use.  There's some elitism out there regarding DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations), don't let anyone convince you that your recordings are inferior just because you used Audacity instead of Pro Tools.

**Choosing a microphone**

The two most common types of microphones are *dynamic* and *condenser* microphones.  I won't get into the technical details, and are preferred for good quality recordings.  That's not to say that all condensers are better than all dynamics--a high-quality dynamic will be better than a cheapo condenser--but all else being equal, the condenser is going to provide better audio quality.

So why do dynamic mics exist?  Well, brass instruments, and screaming vocals with less tweaking needed, and they don't feed back as easily.  They're also much sturdier and don't require power (see the last paragraph of this section).  For these reasons, they're commonly used for live audio reinforcement, but these factors aren't benefits when recording.

There's also the question of diaphragm size: large diaphragm or small diaphragm.  Each has applications that they are more or less suited for

So, and it even comes with some handy accessories.

There's one last thing to know about condensers: they require power.  Some mics can take a battery (and USB mics are usually powered via USB), you need to make sure that your interface can supply phantom power.  Almost all can, just make sure to check.  If you're using any other kind of microphone, turn it off.  Dynamics shouldn't be hurt by it, but other kinds of mics could be.  Also, plug the microphone in before turning on phantom power, and turn off phantom power (and give it a few seconds to discharge) before unplugging the mic.

**Quick tips for getting quality recordings**

First of all, as long as rerecording is an option.

Second of all, then record yourself clapping and look at the waveform--if there's a tail, that's reverb.  Things to avoid are hard surfaces, parallel walls, and square rooms.  Your kitchen and bathroom are the worst possible places (not that you would record there, just as an example).  A carpeted, non-square bedroom without large patches of bare wall will probably be fine.  A walk-in closet with lots of hanging clothes and almost no visible walls will probably be great--lots of hobbyists record in their closets.  Also, but watch out for background noise

Proper mic technique is also critical.  You need to stay in the same spot the whole time.  Moving around will cause the relative volume to change

When listening to a recording, not the ear buds that came with your iPod) are probably okay.  In the pro realm you don't want to monitor using headphones, but it will be okay for casual use.

1361065679.0,18o3hy,"Please, please, PLEASE find a good teacher!!!",Krisington22,43,11, however

But listen up

Find a good voice teacher and do good work with them. Nothing *anyone* says on this thread, or anywhere, no matter how qualified they are, can replace the technique that a well qualified and trained teacher can give you. They hear you, see you, and work with you on a regular basis. They know your likes and dislikes, your goals and aspirations. *Nothing* can replace that. 

I know voice lessons can be expensive and time consuming, if you have any questions or concerns, or if you want help as to where to find a good teacher in your area, I am happy to help. 

Now

* For people who live in very small or rural communities, and they should be well-equipped enough to teach the foundations of singing (posture, breathing, etc). Second, I would find the most populous area near you and search for teachers with my suggestions in the FAQ, and then also search if any of the teachers you find do house visits. Many teachers will teach in the students' home instead of their own studio. The downside with this is that it may cost a bit more.

* Cost is probably the main concern of every singer, however, are very understanding of this and will work with you on this. Some teachers will offer discounts to students for referring a friend. Others may recommend spacing out your lessons every two weeks instead of every week and perhaps invite you to sit in on other (willing) student's lessons to supplement your study of technique. I have even heard of teachers who will accept payment in other forms, such as helping them with chores or babysitting their kids, or something of the like. The key is to be open and honest about your financial concerns and to be flexible yet fair to yourself and the teacher.

I know this has been stated numerous times in various threads

Edit: The concern of how to find a teacher in remote areas has been addressed, think this subreddit is unhelpful. I just think that it should be used as a supplement to a music education rather than the main source, much in the same way that vitamins should be taken in supplement to a balanced diet.

What you want to stay far away from is using your SPEAKING VOICE to SCREAM. Screaming for performance is NOTHING like screaming when you're pissed off. It's a completely different spot in your throat producing the ""crackle"" if you're doing it right. I see a lot of people don't do their research and just yell as loud as they can to scream and produce ""crackle"". This is NOT what professionals or anyone who wants to be able to tour for more than 3 nights a month do. Guitars use distortion, drummers use triggers, and bassists use fuzz. You should too. In a live setting, you should put some light gain on your voice to make it smoother. If you're in a studio setting they will force you to, because it's as rudimentary for sounding good as compression on drums and so on. Look up ""fry screaming"" or ""The zen of screaming"" on youtube. Fry screaming is like learning to crawl before you can walk, but eventually you want to work up to what a lot of people have called a ""power fry"". It's basically putting a light monotone yell WITH VERY LITTLE PRESSURE ON YOUR YELL behind the noise or ""crackle"" of fry screaming to give the effect that you're actually screaming loud. The one thing you're going to have deal with is that it will not be loud at first, it is WORTH THE CHANGE! I have a hundred times more air

It's been said a million and a half times on this forum that your voice will change and not fully settle until your mid to late 20s (if you're a light voiced girl

That's when you can expect your voice type (alto, tenor, baritone, bass) to settle. That's not necessarily when you're at full vocal maturity. Your voice is still super fragile until your 30s. Be conscious of what you're singing and if it's good for you. Just because it doesn't hurt doesn't mean you're not doing a lot of wear and tear that you might not bounce back from. 

At the bottom of the article, but when it's young it's very tiny and very tight and sproingy. Now, take that rubber band and stretch it and mold it until it can do something it shouldn't be able to do for another 10+ years. As that rubber band grows, it will have lost all of its taught and be *too* big and *too* loose to do anything worthwhile. It's basically a piece of string. It's lost all elasticity because it was worn out when it was small.

I hope that makes sense to someone other than me - but that's basically it. If you're too young you'll stretch yourself too far too soon.

1357317757.0,15yg91,A Bit About Vocal Health and Voice Disorders,Krisington22,33,2,21,"Vocal health and voice disorders are a wide fear amongst singers of all types and levels, speech pathologist

First vocal health.

Some of this may seem very basic

1. Water, the average male should take in 3 liters (13 cups) a day and the average woman should have 2.2 (9 cups) a day. This of course varies according to the amount of physical activity you do, but as singers the average is a must. You should know though that it takes 24 hours for the water you take in to hydrate the vocal folds, so if you have a big concert tomorrow, be sure to hydrate today. Drinking water while practicing helps keep your mouth from becoming too dry, but does little to affect the vocal folds in the moment.

2. Sleep. I know this one is hard to do with busy schedules and lives

3. Use a healthy speaking voice. So many singers are taught great technique when it comes to singing, including singers, use their speaking voice much more than their singing voice. Be sure to not shout or scream and to use good breath support for your speaking voice like you would for your singing voice. 

4. Maintain a balanced diet. Not only is this important for your overall physical health but many singers suffer from acid reflux which can greatly affect the vocal folds (more on this in the disorders section).

5. Don't smoke! This is a must. Smoking can cause both lung and laryngeal cancer as well as increase the risk of any of the below disorders. Also drink alcohol and coffee minimally

6. Exercise. Singing can require just as much stamina as any sport

7. And of course


Voice disorders.

There are more voice disorders than those listed here

These first three pathologies all are very similar and can be diagnosed by an ENT

1. Nodules: This is probably the most common disorder amongst singers yet the one that causes the most concern. It should first be known that nodules are *not* mainly caused by poor technique (though this can be a factor) but instead by overuse, usually in the center of the folds. They can cause raspiness and / or ariness in both the singing and speaking voice and generally are not felt. Treatment involves vocal therapy administered by a speech pathologist and ideally a singing voice specialist as well. Complete vocal rest is not required or even recommended.  Know though that nodules are really only a problem when they are symptomatic. Many singers may have nodules without knowing it and as long as it does not inhibit their singing, they really are not a problem.

2. Polyps: Polyps are like vocal blisters and are caused by some sort of phonotrauma. Generally a polyp will occur on only one vocal fold and look like a mass in the middle of the fold. Again, but therapy is necessary during the recovery period to prevent a reoccurrence. 

3. Cysts: Cysts are fluid-filled sacs that appear on the vocal fold for unknown reasons. They generally appear in the middle of the fold, though depending on its placement and your symptoms, surgery may not be necessary.

4. Hemorrhage: Generally caused by phonotrauma, but know that the immediate fix is complete vocal rest. Depending on how frequently it occurs or what caused it, voice therapy may be required.

5. Laryngitis: It is widely, it is actually defined as the inflammation of the vocal folds for any reason, though it is generally a virus. It is sort of a nonspecific term but is usually treated like other viruses. Voice rest is recommended along with plenty of fluids. If the hoarseness continues for more than 2-3 weeks, this is the time to seek out a medical professional.

6. Acid Reflux: This is not a voice disorder so much as a condition that can affect the vocal folds greatly. It also is relatively common in singers due to our greater diaphragmatic use and how that tends to push more stomach acids through our trachea. More often than not reflux is silent, or difficulty using their voice effectively in the morning. There is no cure for reflux but it can be managed through a less acidic diet, especially in the evening and not eating or drinking at least 3 hours before you go to bed. You can also lift the head of your bed (your whole bed, not just your pillows) to keep acid from rising. 

7. Vocal Cord Dysfunction: A condition that exhibits similar symptoms as asthma, reflux, and virus. Most often though treatment involves voice therapy. 

8. Vocal Fold Paralysis: This is where one (or both) of the vocal folds become immobile due to damage in its main nerve. Paralysis is twice as likely in the left fold than in the right, breathiness, difficultly breathing, and feeling the need to swallow. Occasionally voice paralysis will resolve on its own, but most often treatment involves therapy to learn how to utilize your voice to the best of its ability. 

This should cover the basics of what you would want or need to know. If you have any more questions or concerns or addendums, or about voice therapy. If you have concerns about your own vocal health, research your local ENTs and make an appointment. Even if you feel fine and can afford it, a visit to the doctor can be good to establish a relationship and to have a baseline for what your vocal folds should look like and act. Stay healthy Singit!

1375687068.0,1jq7m1,Why a teacher is a good idea.,ghoti023,30,5,48,"Last night I answered a REALLY good question as to why teachers are so important. There have been a lot of good answers to that question on this sub for a while now

So

There are a few reasons as to why having a good voice teacher is important

* You can't properly hear yourself. Really! You can't! What you hear and what the audience hears are two different things. Ever listen to a recording of yourself and go ""Hey! That's not what I sound like at all!""? That's exactly what I'm talking about. Your ears are placed right above your vocal folds (if you're standing right) so you hear your sound before it's even made it out of your mouth. The audience hears everything that comes out of the megaphone that is your mouth. They are two different sounds, *and* have multiple ways to fix any problems (if they're a good teacher, they can always come up with at least three different ways to solve a problem. At least.)

* While the basic mechanics of singing is the same for everyone, is that just because the body is doing the same thing doesn't mean you feel the same sensations as someone else, or are even a similar learner. It's like drugs. Sure, penicillin will work for someone, but for other people it causes mad crazy reactions - but the penicillin will still work just fine. *Because every persons body is different, everyone has a different way they must attack technique.* It's not like a violin, or a guitar, there are lower and higher grades of all of those things, focus on resonating through my hard palate (which works for some people), others their lower abs

* Because you can't see or hear yourself, because there aren't as many nerve endings in there. **Because of this, it is easy to cause damage to yourself.** What you may consider just being vocally tired *could actually result in nodes.* Everyone's body is different, so is everyone's pain tolerance. Hell, there are singers that have never felt any pain or discomfort in their voice, just a mild sense of pressure, and they wind up with vocal health problems because they never thought it was a big deal. The depth of knowledge teachers have will help you avoid this by leaps and bounds. They can sense vocal damage a mile away (if they're good. Remember, and there are bad ones. There's an article in the FAQ about how to find a good teacher

* Since singing is such an inexact science, so you won't have to wade through all of the information yourself. It's WONDERFUL to have that kind of a guide.

* Having a teacher to teach you technique will probably want you to start classically. **DON'T LET THIS TURN YOU OFF FROM SINGING.** The reason why classical tone has been around so long is because it's what the voice naturally sounds like free of tension and with proper breath support. It is important for you to have a teacher that will relate all of this to the style of singing you want to do, and from here you can learn to sing any style healthily with minor tweaks to your technique (usually with resonance and vibrato). *You just have to know what tweaks are healthy to make and which ones aren't, and it's very hard for you to do that by yourself because singing is so inexact.* So definitely find a teacher that will meet you with your goals and will always relate everything back to what you want to do. Just don't be surprised if they throw in an art song or two to help you out. Learning technique adds more tools to your voice. The more you understand technique the more you can do. It's like taking a predominantly acrylics painter and then teaching them how to use watercolors, charcoal, pencil etc... You as the artist will still choose what tools you do and don't use, but your knowledge of the tools will make your base passion stronger. I promise.

This isn't to say that self-teach videos and books are worthless. I encourage singers to be a sponge, remember, you probably can't be a perfect judge of), take it with a grain of salt. All of it. Singing is an inexact science, where weightlifting is a lot more straightforward. Singing has a lot of trial and error, where a lot of weightlifting is just knowing your boundaries, and knowing how to properly lift each different kind of weight. In singing, just *be careful.* It comes with risks, but I've also had plenty of crap teachers. I've been down the road to vocal damage (luckily, and I'm never going back. There really is just no replacement for a good teacher(s).

**TL;DR** The reason it's not like weightlifting is because in weightlifting all the weights are the same, some people didn't have elbows, some had 10 fingers, others had less or more, some had fingers on the tops or in the palms of their hands. All of a sudden, when everyones arms are different, accomplishing the same task of lifting a weight becomes very different for everyone and no one blanket instructional video will be able to cover all the differences. That's what you're looking at - only all of your differences are internal so you can't even see them to group them into different vids.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/1jq7m1/why_a_teacher_is_a_good_idea/

1337660331.0,tyqyp,Musical theater audition guide,maestro2005,23,3,10,"Hello everyone

I've done a bunch of student and community musical theater around the Boston area as a music director and audition accompanist, I felt like collecting my thoughts on auditioning--who knows, maybe someone who auditions for me will read this and be a little more confident!  But seriously, I really just want everyone to do well.

**Note:** Not every audition process is the same, and of course throw it out the window if it doesn't seem applicable for your audition.


**What should I sing for my audition?**

Most auditions at the student/amateur level will accept pretty much any audition song.  Either they will want just one excerpt, so avoid anything too fast like an Arthur Sullivan patter song or a quick Sondheim tongue-twister.  Don't shy away from a slower ballad if it works well for you.  If they ask for two, that actually makes things easier.  Sure, it's a little more prep work, but it actually gives you a lot more leeway with the directors.  As a music director, I typically only ask for one, but the few times that the stage director has asked me to request two, so when someone actually gives me two decent performances it makes them really stand out to me.  If that sounds like a laughable

As for what to pick?  That depends hugely on your voice quality, and even your appearance, so it's impossible to give a good answer in a general guide like this.  Avoid anything with nauseating subject matter, with excessive spoken lines in the middle, or which relies on specific tricks to pull off (e.g., *Confrontation* from *Jekyll &amp; Hyde*).  Something that allows you to show off characterization is good, but something that requires you to be a certain character is bad.  For the student and amateur community levels, unless it's your standard audition song and you can really nail it, then you look absolutely terrible for that part.

Just pick a nice, mellow, or powerful you can be down low.  If you have a higher voice, try to show the extent of your range.  Don't be afraid that your piece seems too easy--it's much better to sing an easier song really well than to struggle a bit with a harder song.  I never think less of an auditioner for using an easy song.  And it will help your confidence.

Avoid the most popular songs from the most popular recent shows

One last thing to consider--if the group is volunteer, don't pick a song that's difficult to sight-read, or you may find yourself having to sing on top of a lot of wrong notes.  If you don't play piano, run it past someone who does.  If a competent pianist struggles to play it, strongly consider picking something else.  Simple keys are great.  Sondheim is generally to be avoided, although there are some easy Sondheim songs out there.


**What should I do if I mess up?**

Just keep going.  I know, because every good auditionee is another good person in our show.  We know that audition songs are usually woefully underrehearsed, so we won't think you're a terrible singer for making a mistake.  We don't care if you have to use the sheet music--in fact, we would rather you use it than try to sing it from memory and get flustered.  If there's a really bad mistake that throws you off, feel free to quickly acknowledge the mistake and take a second to get back on track.  Just don't be annoyingly apologetic, and we'll generally be sympathetic to anything going wrong.

The directors will also understand that you're probably nervous.  It takes a lot of guts to go in front of a group of people who are judging you


**What should I audition for?  Should I audition for a specific role

Be honest.  If you really want a particular part, so there's definitely room to explain your feelings fully.  If it's not on the form, they will probably ask in person, or just assume that you'd consider other parts.  Short of the professional level, nobody is going to assume that you're only interested in one role and that you'd reject anything else.

Don't necessarily get your heart set on the biggest role.  The best part to play is not the biggest one

If you're auditioning with a certain group for the first time, no matter how good they are.  Most student groups will favor students, so if you're not a student at that school, you're at a distinct disadvantage.  These rules can be extremely strict (""no non-student can be cast when there is a student available, regardless of skill"") or more lax, and you can usually ask what the policy is.  In community groups, they may favor existing members, the directors will always be more comfortable casting someone they know and trust as opposed to an outsider.  Because of this


**What else will there be in the audition?**

The group should describe everything in the audition notice, some kind of reading from the show, and a short dance segment for applicable shows.  If you're unsure of anything, don't hesitate to contact the directors and ask--we would be happy to answer your questions and certainly don't want anybody to be confused.  Again, we want you to do well.

For the reading, than get the lines perfect but be stiff as a board.  Most importantly, make an acting choice and stick with it.  That's really what we're looking for--your ability to perform in general, not any specific choice that you make.  If the stage director gives you direction and asks you to read it again, then the director is looking for your ability to take direction, so really exaggerate whatever you're told (don't be ridiculous, but show that you understood it and are willing to give the director what he wants).

If there's a dance portion, even if you're auditioning for a part with no dance requirement.  Either they're obligated to audition everyone identically (common in student groups), or they just want to see what you can do in case they can't offer you that non-dancing part that you want.

That's all I can think of for right now.  If you have any questions

###Pitch

* Is the OP on pitch? Does he/she improvise in tune with the music?

* If the OP is off pitch


###Rhythm

* Is the OP following the rhythm of the music? If not

* If not pronounced very exact

* Does the OP finish his words or swallow them?

* Do the vowels sound like they're supposed to sound

###Placement

* Does the OP have nasality issues? If yes

* Does the OP sing from his/her throat? 

###Bad Habits

Does the OP have any bad habits? For instance:

* seeking for the correct notes or sliding off notes

* fake vibrato

* shouting to get volume instead of using breath support and correct placement


###Dynamics/phrasing

* Does the singing sound like every word/note is pronounced separately?

* Does the OP lose focus between sentences/verses or during an instrumental bridge?

&gt;* Who is good at ""singing"" despite being poorly built for it? Who's good at this who shouldn't be?

I'd say people like Tom Waits, Susan Boyle, etc. They succeed because they're distinct, not because they're the same as others.

&gt;* Who are the most impressive lesser-known teachers?

I will always turn to my personal teacher, but aren't as well known as the Seth Riggs, etc of the world.


&gt;* What makes you different? Who influenced you?

I take pride in trying to model my voice to the wailers of the 80's rock scene

&gt;* Have you trained others to do this? Have they replicated your results?

I teach here and there in NYC

&gt;* What are the biggest mistakes and myths you see singing? What are the biggest wastes of time?

Only opera singers are good singers and teachers. Only people who play piano are good singing teachers. That a long warmup = better voice (when in fact better warmups = better voice). There is a magic lozenge or syrup or pill you can take to make your voice better. That only one type of voice or training is ""correct"". Dairy is terrible for you. All myths.

&gt;* What are your favorite instructional books or resources on the subject? If people had to teach themselves

Try and emulate your favorite songs

&gt;* If you were to train me for four weeks for a [fill in the blank] competition and had a million dollars on the line

I'd focus on creating a ""dumb/cry"" sound to get your soft palate raised and your larynx stable. I'd teach proper breathing technique by descending the diaphragm

&gt;* What are the biggest mistakes novices make when singing or practicing singing?

Yelling/being loud does not equal being better. The better you are at controlling a soft sound is harder than being loud. Drink more water. Practice is good

&gt;* Even at the pro level

Pushing when you don't need to

I'd like to expand on that point

Your diaphragm is actually an involuntary muscle that *you have no direct control over.* It separates your lungs from your intestines and other lower organs

* Spine
* Sternum
* Two lowest ribs

You can control your diaphragm with your intercostal

At rest, the diaphragm flattens as much as it can to pull air into the lungs.

To make sure a singer is making the most of this automatic response (breathing isn't exactly something you think about a lot), without letting my chest collapse. To get the feeling in the lower ribcage, sit in a chair with your elbows on your knees and take a deep breath. Your lower back should expand. When you exhale, keep the lower ribcage expansion. Remember how that feels and keep that while standing or sitting in a normal position. This will pretty much make you sit/stand up straight as well. :) Keeping your ribcage expanded will let as much air into your lungs as physically possible. If you're new to these sensations in expanded ribcages, you can expect to be a little achey after some proper practice. Singing isn't nearly as easy as it looks.

Now, see above) to work for you, you need to contract your abdominals at an appropriate rate to the flow of air you need for your voice. The lower abs do most of this work, so you should feel pressure on the muscles covering your pelvic area and just above your pelvis, like you're engaging in a reaaaaaaallly long crunch.

1357747235.0,1694ma,Registers and How to Blend Them,Krisington22,22,3,25,"Pedagogues today have widely accepted Manuel Garcia’s definition of registers

This chart [here](http://i.imgur.com/QE33V.png) gives a rough approximation of where the vocal registers and breaks lie. 

There are a *lot* of terms out there for the different registers

- Men have chest voice, with chest being their primary register.
- Women have chest voice, with a mix of middle voice and head voice being their primary register.

There are a lot of questions circulating about falsetto, Miller found that many trained singers do not use falsetto as a means to train the head voice. He found that many trained singers don't use falsetto at all. I find this surprising as it seems that men really enjoy exploring their falsetto and have a lot of questions about it, but yet again I am not a male singer. Ultimately I think it depends on the singer and what their teacher feels is best for their development.

So what is physically happening for these register shifts? To know this, as well as falsetto. 

In the first register shift (from chest to mixed or head), is not so much a muscular shift since you already switched to your CT muscles, but instead a shift in resonance, or how sound travels through your vocal tract. It was asked what this will feel like, so know that really it won't feel like much of anything. I mention this here for your information into what's actually happening, but thinking of these muscles is really not a means to working on registration.

As for our vocal folds, the lower notes make the folds look shorter and thicker. Inversely, the higher notes make the folds look more stretched out and thinner. Generally speaking, the folds vibrate together in their entirety with the center being the main point of vibration and not just in particular areas (with voice disorders being the main exception).  


**Up until this point


So how can you blend registers better? What needs to be adjusted? The two factors that need to be adjusted to blend registers are breath pressures and vowels.

As you transition through both registers, vowels need to be modified for clarity of sound. For men, this means that your vowels need to be more rounded. Think somewhere between an “oh” and an “oo” sound. For women, as you go higher, your vowels should open more. Eventually though in head voice, everything begins to sound like “ah”. Know that there is no “ideal” vowel for both men and women, but instead it will be on an individual basis.

As always, or discuss! It is difficult to express such a complex idea through a short article, but I also wanted to make it as conscience and straightforward as possible. I hope this gives you a good foundation to start with though. Best of luck to you all!

1356798290.0,15mmgl,How to Find a Good Voice Teacher,Krisington22,21,1,1,"It seems that everyone in this subreddit agrees that the best way to improve your singing is to find a good teacher, so I’ll make this as conscience as possible.

How to find a teacher

1. Look to your local college/university. Besides being a wealth of teachers, many times their students do. Many schools have bulletin boards within their music departments that either have ads for teachers or you can place ads looking for one.

2. Local music stores may have teachers, but many times they do not. 

3. Organizations like NATS and Classical Singer often have teacher listings according to area. 

4. Craigslist isn’t terrible. I have gotten a fair amount of students myself from Craigslist

5. Do not underestimate the power of word of mouth! If someone you know takes lessons, then they may have other recommendations.

6. Know that there is a difference between a voice teacher and a voice coach. A coach works with you almost exclusively on diction, however, will work primarily on technique but cover all of these things as well.

What to look for in a teacher

1. Be clear about what you want to learn. Many people will tell you that classical training can teach you to sing any kind of style. This is both true and false. Classical training will give you the basics of good singing (e.g. good posture, even though it is much higher in demand. Know though that a good teacher will create a balance of finding music you want to learn and what is appropriate for your development.  

2. Their credentials. Remember though

3. What do their students sound like? What are their students doing now? Try to hear some of their students if you can. Do they all sound the same? This can be an indication that a teacher is a one-trick pony and perhaps not the best. Do you like how their students sound? This might be the teacher for you.

4. How much do they cost? This will vary according to your location and to the length of your lesson (which are usually either ½ hour or an hour)

5. Do they offer sample lessons? Many teachers will offer a lesson for free as a means to make sure that it is a good fit for both of you. Personality matters with a teacher! This is also the time to ask a teacher all of these questions and whatever others you may have. If a teacher does not offer a sample lesson

6. Male vs. Female? Honestly, this is a matter of preference. Singing is a highly personal study since it involves our bodies, so some prefer someone of the same gender for this reason. I prefer to study with other women simply because I feel they understand my vocal issues better. What it comes down to is, a good teacher is a good teacher, and it’s just a question of what you prefer.

If you have any more questions about finding a teacher, please feel free to say so. I hope you have found this helpful, and best of luck to all of you on your search!

My experience so far has been ridiculously positive, at least to me, the more it seems like I'm learning about my voice and how to make it sound good in general, it makes it easier to sing softly or harshly because I'm mostly listening to a consistent audio level regardless (some times one has to get closer to the mic), so despite my positive experience I know I have a tendency to overlook things, and that is why I'm asking for opinions from people who do it professionally, and do it constantly!

I really want a nice, and I know proper breath support and resonance among other things are key to achieving my desired voice, but nobody's ever told me how to attain proper technique. I haven't scoured all depths of the internet, and I haven't even read through a majority of the help posts here, but I wanted to create place where aspiring singers can go to get a majority of the information they're looking for about HOW to become a better singer. 

My main questions (as you can tell) are about resonance and breath support/proper breathing. So I'll get this started with a few questions that I hope someone can answer. 

* How can I achieve and maintain good mask resonance while avoiding nasality? 

* I've heard that proper breathing is through the belly

* I've seen a lot of comments and questions about larynx position

I may be seem vaguely aggressive in this post, I'd be overjoyed! If anyone would like to ask some of their burning questions, I'd be happy to compile them in a comment or an edit in the near future.

1349370820.0,10y0qo,Discouraging thoughts that I've overcome,,14,0,4,"I've been singing with the serious intent of becoming a competent singer for 3 years. I'm currently 18 and self-taught.

I remember early on one of the biggest sources or discouragement from singing was my introverted nature as a person. Just the idea of me wanting to be a *singer* who *performs* in front of people felt totally backward. I was at times convinced that I just wasn't cut out for it. Singing and performing was reserved for the outgoing musical theater kids

Yet I wanted to be a powerful performer so badly (and still do, with many, many highs and lows of my confidence levels, but in recent months I can *finally* say I look and feel comfortable in my own skin while singing. I have a long way to go still, but considering how I have improved over the last 3 years, I must say I am proud of myself. I've never overcome anything so difficult in my life. While it may seem small, I feel as though this has been a true test of my character, dedication and passion for music. And now I am finally comfortable enough as a singer that I can sing in front of friends and I have even played in front of one small crowd so far. I can only imagine how good I will become as I improve into adulthood

I am now starting to write my first songs (I've played the guitar for 6 years and have studied music theory for 3) and I'm realizing that becoming a good songwriter is now a *whole new* journey to undergo. I'm not too great at it now

This whole experience for me has been very peculiar. I've always been a very lazy person without much motivation for anything. I've never been a good student because of a poor work ethic, and not because I feel I ""have to"" to reach my goal, but because I genuinely want to. I aspire to one day move people with powerful performances, and I especially hope to inspire other musicians the way my favorite singers and artists have inspired me, because without their influence I simply wouldn't be where I am now. I feel lucky that I've found my passion and I hope I can one day follow it into a successful, effective career.

I just found this subreddit today and, by any means, but I have done karaoke for years and sing any chance I get.

It is SO easy to get wrapped up in thinking about technique when working on a piece so that all acting goes out the window. That’s okay! It happens! But we can’t let it be our final performance

So what are some ways we can work to liven up even the simplest of pieces?

- Know what the piece is about!! I know this seems obvious

- Decide how you and / or the character *feels* about what is happening. It would be obvious to say that in a love song the narrator feels in love. It would be much more interesting, or the immense joy of love, and so on. Decide what attitude you have about the piece, how you feel about the piece, how the piece makes *you* feel, and then figure out how to feel that in such a way that your audience feels it too.

- Don’t be afraid to move a bit. Some young classical singers will stand in the crook of the piano and not move an inch, hands, head, and body.

- With that said, sway awkwardly, and so on. If you move, make sure that each movement has an intention.

- Use your face. We don't want to create unnecessary tension while singing

- Use a mirror or a video recording device. Oftentimes we think we’re emoting something as much as we can

- When you’re in the practice room, “I really need to work on that run in this piece”, so make that session about that. The next day, perhaps you think, “I really want to show how in love this narrator is”, so that day focus on that. 

- Watch some of your favorite singers. Our favorite singers are favorites for a reason. We like what they do, and then explore how you can do the same with your own.

Male

Today I decided to try out really doing some vocal exercises. My singing teacher has given me a few, I was singing along to 'Dancing through life' from wicked (i'm a musical theatre person) and usually i pretty much falsetto all the chorus, but i noticed i could do a lot more of it 'properly'. I started having a good go at it, and it didn't sound pleasant but i was somewhat hitting the notes without flipping to falsetto or feeling strained. I whipped my keyboard out and found that i was still wobbly on the F, but I could hit it. I tried going to the G.. something usually impossible, and i hit it without straining too much at all. Again, not the prettiest note i've ever hit but usually i simply cannot make a sound like that without screaming/falsetto. I got as high as B when my voice cracked again. Holy crap - I think I just discovered my head voice. I've only ever hit an F properly once before - with the guidance of my singing teacher, but today i did and found out that i can (kind of) hit an A! 

So - with practise I'm hoping these notes will start sounding prettier and fuller. It's a long long journey a head to actually be able to sing tenor songs but I've gotten a step further today.

As you might expect, and in theory shouldn't have a problem with power in his voice.

There's no vibrato and it can feel dead even if tonally it is right on the note.

So, and he knows exactly how to use it. Compare [his version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ymPaEDDP9I) of the well-known ""Una furtiva lacrima"" to some of the bigger voices like [Jussi Björling](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cExgrwG0fhc&amp;feature=related) (who, by the way, wasn't a huge voice himself) or [Jonas Kaufmann](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOVjWb8xcYc). 

Alva's knowledge of his *own* voice brings me to my next point, he never left the purely lyric repertoire (specializing in Mozart, Rossini, et al) save some [*comprimario*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprimario) roles in other Italian operas. There are so many other great singers who did/do perform in roles their voice never should have done and end up with vocal problems later on (e.g. Franco Corelli, Giuseppe Di Stefano). Most of the time this is by lighter voices trying roles that are too heavy for them, or too heavy for them at that period in their lives. Alva never did this, and I am glad he was so smart about his instrument or we may have lost a great voice (he retired in the early 80's but is still alive and *supposedly* teaching at the school at La Scala).

But finally, diction, and especially breath support is amazing. Just look at this video of him as Don Ottavio (for which I believe he was the best ever, btw) [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUnDXmJaiko). Any tenor familiar with the role will tell you that the figurated line on ""nar"" around 1:59 is pretty tough as is, most take a breath halfway through the phrase. As you might notice, Alva does *the entire thing in one breath*, and even then he doesn't seem the least bit phased. That, is what perfect breath control looks like.

I'm CrAzY MoFo 13

So first off, I highly doubt that was the *worst ever*). Essentially the voice crack is the bane of all teenage boys and of younger singers, especially tenors like myself. A voice crack can occur during speaking too and if you've ever sung/spoke all day and gone out to a bar afterwards where you were almost shouting you may notice your voice crack all over the place.

Because of the embarrassing nature of voice cracks, that they're pushing themselves too far up their range where they should not go! Actually, that's not necessarily true; yes, if you force your voice too high up you will often have a voice crack but the key word in that sentence is not ""too high"", but rather, **""force""**. Why? well it's time for me to explain what a voice crack *actually* is. Simply put, when there is some kind excess being put upon the [vocal folds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_folds) an unconscious signal is sent to the brain. The brain then assesses the situation (in some way, *whatever happens in the voice *after* the vocal crack is *always* better than what occurred before it*. So if your voice cracks

In the end, there are less obvious culprits to the crime including *incorrect jaw, tongue, larynx, or rib-cage position; singing on a bad vowel (Franco Corelli noted that when tenors sing up high an ""awe"" in the low voice becomes more ""ooo"" in the high voice); singing with poor placement (i.e. not ""in the mask""); or improper space in the back of the head (i.e. the soft palate)* as well as others I have probably forgot to mention.

So with that in mind

This is the first of three articles designed to show you how to get into classical music and gain a deeper appreciation for it. There are six different periods of classical music, Classical, and Romantic eras. In today’s blog

**Baroque Era**

Derived from the Portuguese word, texturized, and intense music of the period, which lasted from 1600 to 1750. Counterpoint, multiple independent melodic lines or voices, and rich expression through contrast in volume, texture and pace characterized much of the music during this time.

**Johann Sebastian Bach**

One of the pillars of Baroque music, brilliance, and innovation helped define the musical era. Even today, musicians are still amazed at Bach’s immensely complex composition style, heavily reliant on counterpoint, which seem to fit together into a complex system of special codes.

“It’s easy to play any musical instrument: all you have to do is touch the right key at the right time and the instrument will play itself” – *Johann Sebastian Bach*

[Prelude and Fugue in C Sharp](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw-0PRovMU8)

Many of Bach’s pieces at the time were written with a “prelude” designed to introduce the “fugue”, how does it make you feel?

[Fugue in G minor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO8i5D2uz84)

 “Little Fugue” is one of Bach’s most well known fugues. The Fugue in G minor starts out deceivingly simple with one melodic line, adding to the intricacy of the piece. This is a very good example of polyphonic voicing or counterpoint.

Quick note:  I know that several of my friends have figured out my Reddit ID, I just want to see everyone audition to the best of their ability.

**Edit:** This is geared towards students and young amateurs.  I'm assuming that anyone who's auditioning for a professional show isn't looking for tips on Reddit.

**Song Selection**

DO:

* Pick something that fits your range.  Seems obvious
* Pick something that you actually own (or have guaranteed access to) the accompaniment to.  Several people for this round of auditions wanted to sing a particular song, see below).

DO NOT:

* Worry excessively over the appropriateness of your song choice.  Go ahead and sing a modern song for a Gilbert and Sullivan audition if it's what you're most comfortable with.
* Sing anything from the show.  I talked about why this is a bad idea in the original article.  Seriously
* Sing anything from *Rent* (or really any musical that has a famous movie adaptation
* Sing unaccompanied, and avoiding this forces us to assume the worst.  Everybody who's done at least 3 shows has had an experience where an actor just could not follow the orchestra, making all of his songs sound awful, and wants desperately to avoid this in the future.

**Sheet Music**

DO:

* Photocopy your music onto single-sided paper
* Find something simple to follow.  If your excerpt requires more than 4 or 5 pages, and cuts.  Do NOT make the accompanist flip pages or jump all around something with a crazy road map.

DO NOT:

* Use a piano/conductor score.  These range from difficult to impossible to sight-read.  Copy something out of a published ""Vocal Selections"" book.  Ideally
* Use something with minimalist (or nonexistent) accompaniment.  There's a whole series of voice books that have really boring

**Performing the Song**

DO:

* Make a decision about interpretation.  Doesn't have to be major
* Try to keep going.  If there's a train wreck that's so bad you have to stop

DO NOT:

* Talk about how nervous you are or how badly you think you did.
* Apologize for mistakes.",,t5_2rlcx,1355497572.0,,star,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/14tcfl/musical_theater_audition_guide_part_2/
1354047792.0,13w35y,Stylistic Choices v. Vocal Health Necessities (a guideline for following critiques),ghoti023,10,2,13,"Since this subreddit is critique heavy

**Things that *need* to be heeded when mentioned in a comment.**

* *BREATH SUPPORT.* There's lots of articles floating around here about what is and isn't proper breath support. The short version is that you should be breathing into your lower abdominals- the ones on top of your pelvis (if you're thinking the diaphragm, with the slow contraction of those abs. Along with breath support, there will be comments about your *POSTURE.* Having good posture is necessary to having good breath support, so make sure you pay attention to comments about posture too.
* *TENSION/RELAXING.* Tension will almost always make you sound worse. Being relaxed and letting your body feel free and natural will always make you sound better. It's important to still feel a firm core to your body so you're not wobbly
* *INTONATION.* Being ""in-tune"" is critical. We've all heard singers that sound a bit ""off"" with their intonation (going flat or sharp, the voice can produce pitches in-between the whole-step/half-steps of western music. (There are cultures that use quarter tones, and 20th century shenanigans that use weird tunings.) So being able to correctly tune yourself is essential. This means ear training and working on muscle memory to get the folds to exercise intonation. It is possible to be singing the correct pitch but for it to come out of your mouth incorrectly due to incorrect technique. A lot happens between your neck and when you release the sound out your mouth, so be careful to pay attention to these critiques.
* *VOCAL FREEDOM.* Letting your vocal folds vibrate freely without tension is the most important thing you can do. Any strain or pain felt in the vocal cords will not only sound strained and uninviting to the audience, the better 4/5 times. (This excludes some genres of rock/metal etc...)

It's a pretty short list, it's best to seriously evaluate the situation.

**Things that are stylistic choices/tools that get mentioned frequently; Up to the performer as to whether or not a change needs to be made.**

There are infinite ways to sing/speak/scream/yell/yodel etc... and each of them have their own style, make sure you're doing it on purpose. You'll never please everyone, but being lazy about stylistic choices is *not* the way.

* *DICTION (pronunciation of words).* Vowel/consonant choices do effect how you sound, vowel modification in different registers of the voice, or even how long you stay on a ""soft"" consonant (r and s most frequently). It is recommended that you give these things a whirl, as something someone suggested may change your sound completely for the better. Worse comes to worse, you don't like it and you keep doing it the way you have, but you won't lose anything by trying. I personally suggest that if you get a comment from someone saying that they can't understand your words that you work on making your words more understandable, but this too is a personal choice.

* *PLACEMENT*. Critiques on darkening/brightening a tone happen as well. Darkening a tone adds drama, but if done incorrectly can make you sound like a nasal mouse. A balance of both is preferable to most people, but you may be told to try it more in one way or another, especially depending on the song. Again, give it a whirl. You never know what will happen. Be careful to follow the top four rules of healthy singing so that (in particular when darkening) you don't end up depressing your larynx so far that it's uncomfortable or hurts.

* *NASALITY.* Again, which is generally what most people want to listen to (in western music). However- nasality has been sneaking in through pop/rock/musical theatre over the last century or so, making it a stylistic choice. Nasality can cause issues with intonation, as it by nature depresses the soft palate, which depresses the sound, which can cause the singer to flat. It IS possible to sing with nasality in tune, it's just a precaution to take if choosing to use it. Nasality also has the tendency to not let you project your sound as far

* *VIBRATO.* Knowing *how* to use vibrato is rather important

* *TONE.* Having a ""rock"" tone or a ""metal"" tone or a ""pop"" tone or a ""classical"" tone are all up to you. Go with what you feel. Give new things a try when suggested

Sometimes removing vibrato or other parts of your singing temporarily will help you improve your song as you focus on other specifics

There are general guidelines to each genre of music that define what that genre is. So getting comments such as ""since this is a classical piece, we're also musicians. Making musical decisions like what styles you want to meld is half of the fun. If you listen to the radio today, you'll find a good chunk of pop songs are actually a mixture of pop, techno, and dubstep- and that's only one example. Genres like pop-punk, jazz musicals (such as Chicago), and the like all happened because someone took two things and put them together. No reason you can't either if you like it.

I'm not saying this to tell you to dismiss suggestions given to you on critiques you post. There's actually a lot of good advice posted on this forum. Just use your thinking cap and actively choose, and don't be afraid of trying out new ideas.

1347367497.0,zpeup,[Advice] Has anyone got experience of getting over major stage fright?  I'm getting really down at not being able to show people what I can do.,flollop,10,1,31,"If it makes any difference - I'm a 19 year old girl

Basically I cannot for the life of me sing in front of anybody bar my teacher.  The more people you add to the room the more my ability just declines.  The amount of nerves I get cause my vocal chords to tense up completely to the point where I can't physically use a large part of my range which creates in itself a vicious circle (I'm nervous - my voice will be bad - I'm even more nervous etc etc).

I would really really love to audition for my university choirs and maybe even the musical theatre society but I have no idea how I would ever get out there and do it.  I actually turned up to try last year but I had completely lost my speaking voice up until only a couple days before and had no opportunity to practice/warm up - when I tried to explain this I got told I had to do it anyway to 'prove my commitment' and show that I'm reliable and I could barely squeak a note out.  Ended up crying in front of the conductor which wasn't exactly an affirming experience!

I made some progress back at school

Has anybody got advice about overcoming it when it's this bad?  It's not even like I can use the nerves or like it's good anyway when I actually get up there and do it because it just isn't.  In the past I have had panic attacks and spent days crying in advance of having to perform even in ensembles.

**First Question**: [Can you talk about some common misconceptions in singing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/pmc35/vocal_coach_question_request_thread_feb_12_2012/c3qlnvj)

*My Answer:* You know, a nice, clear tone. But I think one of the biggest misconceptions is that your vocal coach is right all the time, and that you *must adhere to the religion that is your vocal coach.* I've had 3 vocal coaches in my life, and I gained and learned something from each one. Each approach was different, and a lot of teachers will say ""my way is the correct way"", but the only ""correct"" way is the way that gets you to feel successful with your voice. There will be overlapping themes in most teachers approaches, you can get the most out of it.

I think the other thought I have is that some people think choir singing is solo singing or mix singing. Choir singing is a very specific type, but can add unnecessary tension to the throat and the mouth. Do it for your choir leader when they ask for it, but for solo singing, focus on relaxation.

The last thing, and only should be used when needed. But to approach the entire voice with the tension ""attack"" is the wrong way to go about it. Don't use your nitro immediately, just use it when you're running out of gas.

**Second Question**: [What would you say to help such an absolute beginner get started?](http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/pmc35/vocal_coach_question_request_thread_feb_12_2012/c3qhxfc)

*My Answer:* Sing sing sing. Just keep singing. Sing as much as you can. Sing in front of people. Sing alone. Sing in the shower. Sing to the radio and to music you have playing. The more you play with your voice

And in terms of singing in front of people: don't think about talent. Think about having fun. The more fun you have, it's going to come through your voice. Singing is fun, and you should use it to have fun.

Hope that all helps guys. I'll start a new question thread at the end of the week!

ANYWAY. That's what prompted this post.

She discussed getting over stage fright

There is nothing to be afraid of on the stage. The worst thing that will happen is that you'll have a bad performance. The more you worry about it

Of course

* **BEFORE YOU EVEN WALK ON THE STAGE, AND SIDEWAYS.** Think about it - all of your favorite actors have all of their lines (and their partners) memorized, your favorite teachers know exactly what they're going to teach that day, chefs make sure they have all of the ingredients and recipes they'll need. No one that was ever good at something half-assed the prep work. Know your words, know your music, *know what message and emotion you're trying to inflict upon the audience.* If you're singing something in a different language, you best have your translations SOLID (word for word, not the three words before it in the poetic translations). This will not only make you feel more comfortable because you know you know your shit

* Before walking on stage, do so. I personally find the former more helpful, but different strokes for different folks. I've seen the latter work for others. Just know what you're doing.

* **[POWER POSE!](http://www.businessinsider.com/power-pose-2013-5?op=1)** Sure it looks silly to do, I've tried it myself. I can't say that it's wrong. Plus, you get the added bonus of the next point.
* Be able to make fun of yourself. The reason you're so afraid is because you take yourself too seriously. You have to be able to look at yourself in the mirror and laugh. I once was so nervous to get a 3 page aria right, now that's known as ""Vissi D'arte, the abridged version by Ghoti023."" There's a girl from my school who last summer was doing a summer program in a germanic country - and she was singing with the orchestra. She forgot ALL of the words, and she had to make up 4 minutes of German... to an all German audience. WHOOPS. We're both still performing (she just got back from a jazz tour that went to France and some shenanigans), neither of our reputations are permanently damaged, any one that we could have been singing for that would have given us a job wrote it off that we were young (younger than 22). You gotta love yourself, you gotta love what you do
* **HAVE FUN!!!!** If you're not having fun, it's awkward for all parties. The Audience is generally rather forgiving (why do you think they're in the audience, and not on stage themselves? Shit's hard yo) so relax. You're doing what you love, and even if you goof, there are still very few people who can say that they do what they love, even as a hobby. Lots of people struggle to find something they love to do for their life. Enjoy what you do. 
* As pointed out by /u/zerocoke below, the more relaxed about it you'll be. It's hard to put your nose to the grind and face your fears like that, but ""practice makes perfect"" is a saying for a reason. The more you do it, the better you'll get at it.

We've all heard the ""your body is your instrument"" speech. (Or if you haven't let me know and I'll fill you in).

As pressures rise for singers attempting to go into the professional field to be Hollywood-hot, for your voice to not eat or eat in an incredibly unhealthy fashion. What's good for your body is what's good for your voice.

Singing is becoming a more televised event, I'd look akin to [this](http://theviewspaper.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/Skeleton-Woman.jpg).

This isn't to say that thin singers are bad singers either. EVERYONES BODY IS DIFFERENT. Some people are made to be small and thin

I just want to take this time to remind everyone to just be healthy. Exercise, and your voice will thank you for it. Your breath connection will be better, you'll have more energy for a performance, and you'll feel better about yourself. I promise you'll notice a difference in your singing for the better. You only get one voice, and one body. Whether you like it or not, your voice is integrated with the rest of your body, so take care of the whole package.

&gt;On the south side of the town on the wrong side of the tracks.

&gt;Sometimes on the way into town we'd say

&gt;Sometimes we did but her hands flew from her side.

&gt;Wild eyed crazy Mary.


&gt;Down a long dirt road past the Parson's place.

&gt;That old blue car we used to race.

&gt;Little country store with a sign tacked to the side.

&gt;Said 'NO L-O-I-T-E-R-I-N-G ALLOWED.'

&gt;Underneath that sign always congregated quite a crowd.


&gt;Take a bottle drink it down. Pass it around.

&gt;Take a bottle drink it down. Drink it... Pass it around. Pass it a...
A-take a bottle drink it down. Pass it... Pass it a... Pass it around.

&gt;One night thunder cracked. Mercy backed outside her windowsill.

&gt;Dreamed I was flying high above the trees over the hills.

&gt;Looked down into the house of Mary.

&gt;Bare bulb on Newspaper covered walls. And Mary rising up above it all.

1364399749.0,1b466y,What's the most effective way to give constructive criticism to other musicians/singers without hurting anyone's feelings?,accidentaldouche,10,0,34,"I naturally have a thick skin, however, it was a weird juxtaposition and definitely had a negative effect on the playing/ made me and presumably other people in the ensemble feel awkward)

I would like to be able to give valid criticism without coming off as harsh, I'm not sure how to do that.  She didn't really have many positive things beyond the basics going on, and I think reaching too far to use the sandwich method by giving a compliment like ""your 3/4 pattern was in time"" is just as bad as saying ""nothing you did was good."" I mean, every performer knows what you really mean when you say ""well, you look lovely tonight, but..."".


So here's the question.  In situations like this, or do you just jump straight into suggesting a solution without letting them know specifically what the problem was?  Do you handle constructive criticism differently in one-on-one versus in a group?  Is it significantly different case-by-case?  Also, any tips from those of you who give constructive criticism to musicians successfully and often would be appreciated!

I'm really struggling to figure out how to make a song ""my own"". An audition coming up in June requires me to do so. I would really like to sing the song ""The Ghost of You""

I have been trying to draw inspiration from other covers that I think really show a new side to songs. These are the things I've picked up on so far:

[Kanye West - Gold Digger ft. Jamie Foxx](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vwNcNOTVzY)

[Lucy Spraggan - Gold Digger](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enG44JMUUZY)

- Speed up the tempo (not sure if appropriate for a sad song)
- Use different instruments (the audition is acapella)

[The Postal Service - Such Great Heights](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wrsZog8qXg)

[Iron and Wine - Such Great Heights](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKGHkBComjM)

- Slow down the tempo (possible as long as it doesn't make the song boring)
- Sing in head voice as opposed to chest voice (definite no

[Yeah Yeah Yeahs - Maps](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIIxlgcuQRU)

[The Fray - Maps](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwtuJdh6McA)

- Change the key/notes (that would be great
- Have a super distinctive voice (that would also be great but I unfortunately don't have one)

I figured out that, I'm screwing up. You aren't actually on your note with the recording until you hear your voice ""disappear"". It's counterintuitive, because you'll be trying to hear yourself, and probably be singing about a half step out of tune. When you sing the precise same note as the recorded singer, your voice will blend with theirs, exactly as if you were doubling vocals in the studio. So you won't hear yourself, even though you actually are hearing yourself, NOW baby

Once I figured that out

Anyway

If I sing or raise my voice at all, but the strength is just not there. It sounds really weak, I can't get into mix, I don't think I have ever even sang in my chest voice... It's not that it's ""breathy"", or ""pitchy"", it's just really weak.

So how would I fix that problem? How would I give my voice strength? I'm not going to try and be some kind of opera singer

I know people will say to find a teacher. But I need to strengthen my voice a little before I can find a teacher because I have no confidence or self-esteem to sing to one without having at least SOMETHING to show them. Also I'm barely scraping by and have no money and I absolutely can't risk getting a terrible coach that will harm me in the long run (and not just financially).

There have been a few articles written about [range](http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/13kj4i/your_singing_and_your_range_a_letter_of_my/)

So dudes- What you need to know, and your voice has a lot more it has to do in order to mature from its boy-sopranohood of your youth. For this reason, I strongly encourage not being too terribly tied to any voice-type assignment. (Ladies, your voices don't settle till at least your early 20s, many of you later, but a good chunk of the time the ""settling"" your voice does doesn't really change you between an alto and a soprano at least as drastically. In short, it's different.)

So

1) **Be honest to yourself about where it's comfortable to sing.** For starters, but in order to find music that's good for you to sing (not just classical stuff) you need to know where you sing the easiest, and what parts of your voice are actually usable on a performance basis, and what needs to be worked on.

2) **Know your range.** As I said above, that'll help you.

3) **What is the spot in your range that is easiest to sing?** This is what classical folks call the tessitura. It's where your voice sits the best. This isn't just where it's the easiest to sing, probably wouldn't do well on a song that sits on an E (above middle C) for a really long time. Sure, they've got the note, but it's probably a little more comfortable for them to sing forever on a lower pitch.

4) **Where does your voice feel like it needs to switch from chest voice to headvoice?** We've all felt it, wretched, piece of crap, spot. Well, if it sits rather high for you, you're probably a higher voice. If it sits pretty low, you're probably a lower voice. This is what is called the passaggio.

5) **What tone does your voice have?** If your tone is lighter, you're *more likely* to be a lower baritone/bass. This isn't always the case. There are plenty of meaty sopranos/tenors, and lighter baritones/altos. (Light basses are really odd, but they do happen. Sometimes). This is why you gotta know your range and tessitura.

These things put together will help you get a general idea of what your voice type may be. Keep in mind that it's always subject to change. Women of this subreddit: everything I just said is pretty much applicable to you as well

There are a bunch of places online to find references for all of these things. [This](http://www.library.yale.edu/cataloging/music/vocalrg.htm) is a pretty okay one to work off of for a reference. Just you know

Your questions:

[Rahl001:](http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/qhf1y/vocal_coach_question_request_thread_mar_4_2012/c3xr81s)
&gt;I am curious to how I can relieve all the tension in my throat. I've had a few voice lessons in the past and I've figured out that's my primary problem when trying to sing high notes... however I can't seem to figure out how to use the breathing exercises that I've found online to help me relax. A simple and CLEAR (long-term?) guide on what to do to relieve my tension would be invaluable to me
&gt;

**My answer:**  A lot of what you're experiencing may also include tongue

But if you want a great metaphor: if you can think about going up the register not like stairs, in that you're keeping your larynx stable and low, and your head relaxed. The more you keep the sound ""on the ground"" and not ""in the treetops"", you can release some of that tension. I think as you go up the scale, you're probably hiking up your larynx, which is going to create throat tension.

The other thought would be this: have you had a massage lately? Sometimes a massage can help clear up excess tension you've been having. Also
](http://amzn.com/B000PRMCJU) are good tools to quickly relieve tension

[oh_fuck:](http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/qhf1y/vocal_coach_question_request_thread_mar_4_2012/c3xoqha)
&gt;My friend and I argue about this all the time. He has a beautiful voice

**My answer:**  You can't just the natural timbre of your voice? Did you accidentally the whole thing? I try to just the natural timbre all the time.

Just kidding.

Anyone can learn to sing. It's a matter of biological coordination and calibrating your hearing.

The biggest stumbling block that a lot of people have is ""I don't sound good"". Bullshit. You're hearing your voice though muscle and bone and brain. You can't hear yourself the way other people here you.

And the other side is that ""the tone isn't good"". There are plenty of successful musicians who have a strange or different tone. There are markets for everyone.

But my final answer: anyone can learn to sing. It's just a matter of practice.

[dukedog:](http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/qhf1y/vocal_coach_question_request_thread_mar_4_2012/c3xp88j)
&gt;What are some different techniques for improving resonance in the mask and improving tone in general?

**My answer:** This is a quick one - keep having a round tone by keeping the soft palatte relaxed and up, on lines when you have a lot of different vowels, try to make the vowels sound similar. Kind of like with an Irish accent on the vowels. This keeps them narrow, and more resonant.

I've read morons who try to tell students to physically sing the pulsation instead of letting it happen naturally. If this is your view


I've read from people who say it's a simple variation in pitch produced by the free oscillation of the vocal folds. Well


The way I have always understood vibrato is as a muscular process. To quote John Large:


&gt;The vibrato is a modulation of frequency and amplitude resulting from the pendulum-like movements of the intrinsic laryngeal musculature. These movements are said to prevent fatigue at the laryngeal level; in other words the musculature is alternately working and resting in vibrato. In the production of straight tone the musculature is constantly working. - NATS Bulletin 1976.


This makes sense to me because the younger you are, as the muscles get to a level of maturity where the healthiest way for them to do their job is to constantly release then engage. It also explains why vibrato gets larger as you get older since your folds need longer to rest.


I'm curious to hear other understandings as well.",,t5_2rlcx,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/jw5yb/fellow_pedagogs_and_pros_what_is_your/

Well, projection, pitch, wimpy tone, etc etc. The last year or so I have been putting quite a bit of time into singing/while playing guitar. I have been playing guitar for several years, and I am actually a pretty decent guitar player, but I have noticed that my singing and playing both go to hell when I am doing them together.

I can hear I am off key quite badly in some parts, I would like to reduce that, and I have to a degree. But I do not want to lose the rasp entirely either. 

I am interested in classical singing/training as far as it helping me in my preferred style of music (I would say folk/rock/pop like Mumford and Sons, and I think my rasp/yell thing is a bit too harsh for that music (not to mention loud as crap, which might not be a terrible thing, I don't know). Like on some of the notes in Mumford where he gets pretty raspy, but I have to get even more so to grab those notes with my chest voice. One thing I know I want is a bit softer high range, and a harsher or stronger low end if that makes sense. 

I do focus on using my diaphragm to breath, single take on my laptop (sorry for the super bad quality), and I really sucked it up in parts. But I figured I might as well just post it up and see what you guys can tell me. 

I see some posts here about people asking for feedback and then not really responding. I will appreciate and respond to all feedback. I have severe performance anxiety (just singing)

I have always thought I had a terrible voice. Now I am seeing a little light at the end of the tunnel...but it still sounds really bad, I am very serious about becoming a good singer. Music is the only thing I really like to do, and I have been really letting myself backslide these last years in practice and therefore talent, but the singing has reinvigorated me, and given me passion for something I had lost passion for. 

As a sidenote, Chris Cornell, and lately I have really been enjoying the singer of Mumford and Sons, I think he has a really good voice. 

Anyway

P.S. If you made it through all that

I've just recently started singing. I sing punk rock, Flogging Molly, etc.  I feel like since I've started that I've managed to condition my voice to a sound that reflects the above.

Since I've been on here

I can't say I've noticed any negative effects of what I would consider ""getting my voice in shape"", I have a set of songs in the vocal style I'm aiming at that I make a point of singing along to in the car on the way home from work. So, for a good half hour of solid, aggressive singing, I can say I don't notice any fatigue.

So the question I have is

I took a few lessons from Ben Alfree (the dude that posts about free lessons over Skype) but my schedule has been nuts lately

I was wondering if there is a way to reach falsetto on command, but at other times, a stream of air simply blows or slightly whistles out. For example, this morning I could sing the chorus of ""Thinkin Bout You"" by Frank Ocean, but when I attempted to again later on, I found that my ablility to sing in falsetto had disappeared. I honestly would love to develop and explore my falsetto more; it's rare that I get to do so, and often times the same stream of air just flows out of my throat.

I've been debating posting here for awhile.  Tonight I decided that was silly because you all seem very nice and I'd like to get better if possible. 

Here's the story in a nutshell: years ago I had a couple people tell me never to sing again, he's not much of a teacher.  He thinks there's something wrong with my intonation, and I'm inclined to agree-when I sing, it feels more or less natural, but when I listen later I think I sound pinched off.  It's hard for me to tell since it's my own voice.  He's given me plenty of generic advice-""sing from your diaphragm"" and ""relax when you sing,"" but none of it seems to work well.  The best success I had was when he told me to sing like I was speaking the words on pitch, but I can't seem to recreate that.

Obviously I need to work on pitch and tempo as well

I got a lot of comments. A lot just telling me how cool this was and a lot addressing some concerns over the poll. I'm going to go through some of the comments here.

&gt;Minimize the last question to just specific genres

This makes sense to me. Perhaps I should have done this question where the only choices were the main reddits in each genre just because it would have been a huge issue to do every music reddit
&gt;Add keyboards as an instrument

I got a couple of comments like this. It makes sense in practice
&gt;Make globally specific. Need to add ABRSM as well as K-12

Good point. Will do.
&gt;Add private schools to the education section. I went to post secondary for audio engineering

Is this something like a trade school idea? Was not aware of this choice.

&gt;It might be interesting to add some questions about those controversial topics; ""tube amps or solid state?"" etc, of course.

I would like to add this question. Perhaps people could start making a few questions they would like answered?
&gt;The ensembles playing in section doesn't seem to relate to anyone playing in pop, or country bands.  It looks just like school stuff.

This was probably the aspect most commented on. I didn't want this to be interpreted this way. I have always used ""ensembles"" as a general descriptor for musical groups. Please know that the word ensemble doesn't have a higher meaning that only college chamber ensembles can use. I meant for that answer to also relate to garage bands and such. The reason I used the word ensemble is because it tends to have a broader meaning then just band. However

If you have a dying question you need answered bring it up here.

So onto the results that were interesting;

1. 65% of everyone who answered plays guitar in some fashion. That's pretty remarkable to me
2. A lot of you guys are band leaders. What happened to the socially awkward penguin persona everyone in Reddit is suppose to have?
3. The most popular genre subreddit is jazz? What in the world? I truly did not expect this at all. The second most subscribed was classic rock which seems much more in line with what I think as most musician's viewpoints.

When my voice feels free, it's quite loud and low; a low E sounds good if I'm relaxed (on vacation for example, away from computers. A few weeks ago I was away with a big group of people and more than one person told me I have a really low voice), which is often

My voice is pretty easily affected by everything really, you name it. I recognize it and try to consciously relax when it happens but I want this problem completely gone..

**My questions is:** Would it be stupid of me to upload a video via camera of my singing to get critiqued? (I'm too shy right now to actually be on video, it's weird. )

I'm very shy about singing, and a friend of mine (as well as maybe..2-3 others) who was on American Idol (and made it to Hollywood!, but didn't get any further, lol) told me I sounded beautiful, so it boosted my confidence to a whole new level.

1366408166.0,1cpaq6,"On Pushing, air pressure, and inside vs. outside voices",keakealani,10,6

&gt; April 20

&gt; One consistent issue that many teachers confront is that of pushing. But what does pushing mean? Pushing, imbalance in registration, loss of high range, and general body tension. Even though a singer’s sound may be big in a smaller room, it rarely carries in the theater or opera house because the tone has an element of ‘shrill’ as opposed to ‘resonant’.

&gt; I tell my students that before I knew much about singing, the singer is then faced with the challenge of forcing air pressure as a desperate attempt to increase volume. When too much air pressure is used, the laryngeal position is usually too high.

&gt; But WHY do we push? Is there a concrete reason? The first thing that comes to my mind is that we are listening too much to our own sound. Good singing can feel quite internal. When the sound is correctly produced inside the pharynx and inside the head

&gt; One BIG red light in a voice lesson is when a singer begins a sentence with ‘it sounds like’. I always stop the singer and reiterate the need to feel instead of listen. I learned from Allan Lindquest to 'feel instead of listen'. He probably said that about 50 to 100 times per lesson. I am still convincing myself to do the same thing today and I constantly speak about this to my students. Listening to inside tone as a guide is useless and actually takes a singer backwards in their process

&gt; I consistently refer to a master class I presented in London several years ago. I was working on a lot of frontal vibration with the open throat and the forward arched tongue position as in the NG. Up close the sounds I made were not beautiful, reflected a warm, dark and ringing baritone sound. This was such a great lesson in vocal acoustics and how the law of acoustics works in the theater. It was a real view of learning that what is beautiful in the theater is often NOT beautiful inside the singer’s head or even up close. This is why as teachers we must train our ear so that we guide our singers toward the theater sound, NOT the sound in a small room.

&gt; Several years ago I had a student who sang with a world famous baritone at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York. The question put to me was, “He sounded terrific in the theater!” So many singers who sing on ring are considered to have a harsh tone up close, yet in the theater the voice warms and develops a fantastic color. 

&gt; Some singers push air pressure when they get in a dry or dead room or theater. There is one theater in New York that is notorious for the lack of feedback. The statement so many singers say to me is “I always push in that theater!” When we refrain from pushing for more sound

&gt; Some young singers make the mistake of listening to recordings of dramatic singers and then imitate what they think the singer is doing to produce the sound. A true dramatic voice does not have to push to make dramatically exciting sound. But if young singers start to imitate the dramatic sound and he/she happens not to be a dramatic voice type

&gt; Personality and Pushing: Another factor in the push reflex is the personality. If we have an aggressive personality

&gt; Learning to teach or sing for the theater instead of for the studio is a critically important part of vocal training. Congratulations to those who study this aspect of singing training and work to understand it more and more. It takes courage to understand that we do not have to make a huge sound for it to carry.

I suppose you need background? How I did this damage in the first place? Well, really fast. The alto part in choir was too high for me, but, not wanting to cause trouble (because I was too proud, in other words, to admit that I was incapable of singing any female part) I said nothing. Ow. (Ow!) And, on top of that

 When school drew to a close last June I finally went to our choir/band teacher and told him that there was no way I could do any of these things anymore becuase I had, but it still does when I talk for longer than usual. I can now play the oboe for a grand whopping seven minutes, the bassoon less. A specialist recommended seeing a speech therapist, but... we can't really afford that. Even a little bit of advice (besides the oh-so-general 'rest and be careful') would thrill me right now. I cannot describe to you how much this scares me. This will go away, won't it?

Really, would you all be able to help me out/answer some questions?



1: I always hear people saying this style of singing damages your voice



2: How would I go about finding an instructor for this style of music/rock music? I live in the middle of nowhere ( upstate New York ) and have no idea where to begin looking


3: I'm willing to put as much time and effort into this as possible, of course. ) I have an afters school job; 1 3/4 hours a day, $8 an hour, 4 days a week, so I do have some of my own money to use for lessons. 


4: My other main goal other than developing this singing style is to learn to play guitar and sing at the same time; I'm guessing that's just a pure ""practice makes perfect"" thing?
