**TLDR** We are protons and neutrons

**The Extended Rant**

The Higgs mechanism isn't what gives *us* mass.

No

Not just us.  Also our dogs and houses and laptops and such.  

We can use the Higgs mechanism to give mass to fundamental particles:  Quarks and electrons and W's and Z's.  We are, largely, up composite particles: protons and neutrons.

A brief aside before I dive into this.  We're going to be living in Einstein-land for a second.  By this I mean that we are going to start using 'Mass' and 'Energy' interchangeably, or rather 'the energy that is intrinsic to the particle itself, independent of what it's doing'.

So, and the Higgs boson gives mass to quarks, done and done, right?

Go look up the masses and compositions.  Wikipedia will do.:

A proton is made up of two up quarks and one down quark.  It has a mass of 1 GeV.
An up quark has a mass of .002 GeV
A down quark has a mass of .005 GeV.

Now

Wait

multiply by two.... line up the decimal.... huh.

That doesn't seem right.

The proton seems to have a bunch of mass

See, or electro-magentism.  It sends out a pull to the rest of the universe that gets weaker and weaker as things get further away.  I can count up the total pull it can exert and, because it gets weaker as things get further away, I come to a finite answer.  This is how much 'energy' my ball of gravity-exerting-thing or ball of electricity-exerting-thing has.  If I do the same thing with the strong nuclear force, I find that the pull doesn't get weaker as I go far away, it gets *stronger*.  Now, there's a lot of space that's really far away that my strong force is pulling at harder and harder.  If I try to add all of those up

Clearly, it's sitting inside of some collection of particles where, over a long distance, their strong nuclear force cancels out.  If I had a pair of particle have a strong nuclear charge, and I start pulling them apart, they would pull harder and harder and harder against me, until that pull takes so much energy

Okay, those quarks inside the proton have a strong nuclear charge .  They have an electric charge too.  If I'm looking closely enough to actually see these individual strong nuclear charges, then I can see the huge pulls that they're exerting on everything around them.  (These pulls have so much energy that the are being converted constantly into particles and anti-particles for very brief periods of time).  These huge pulls have a lot of energy associated with them, and this means that if I need to make a proton, I have to provide enough energy for these huge pulls.  This extra energy isn't just some small correction, it's actually 99% of the energy of a proton.  Even moreso, I don't need a Higgs mechanism to generate this 99% of the proton mass.  It comes from the amazing behavior of the strong nuclear force.  Even if my quarks had zero mass in themselves, and literally is the proton mass.

So, compared to the proton mass of 1GeV.  (The electron does get all of its mass from the Higgs mechanism, it's just not very much).

In closing:  Please stop saying that the Higgs boson gives mass to everything we know.  The truth is *so* much cooler.",,t5_2qhi6,1342153551.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/wgqki/lets_get_this_right_the_higgs_boson_does_not_give/

1366093888.0,1cg48r,Dimensional analysis to estimate blast yield of today's explosion in Boston,PenisBall,478,111,122,"**Purpose:**  It's possible to estimate the blast yield of the explosive device used in today's Boston explosion.  The blast yield can then be used to help investigators determine what type of device exploded.  Authorities probably have a method to determine what the device is but maybe we can help.  


**Method:**  Some time ago I remember using dimensional analysis to calculate the blast yield of a nuclear explosion.  ~~I wish I could remember the name of the physicist that invented this process so I could give him/her credit but sadly I can't remember.~~  The name of the physicist that used this technique is [Geoffrey Taylor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._I._Taylor).  This is a back of the envelope calculation based on what I can remember so I need the help of r/physics to peer review my math and make sure I didn't forget a variable or make a mistake.  Although this was used to calculate the blast yield of a nuke

Units:

radius r = L

air density  ρ = M/(L ^ 3)

energy e = M(L/T) ^ 2

time t = T


we can write r as a function of the other three variables as:

r = f(ρ

(1) : r = A[ρ ^ x][e ^ y][t ^ z] where A is a constant

Substituting units yields:

L = A[[ML ^ -3] ^ x][[M(L/T) ^ 2] ^ y][T] ^ z
 
Expanding and solving exponents:

L = (M ^ x)(L ^ -3x)(M ^ y)(L ^ 2y)(T ^ -2y)(T ^ z)

0 = x + y

1 = -3x + 2y

0 = -2y + z


x = -1/5

y = 1/5

z = 2/5

Substituting back into (1):

 r = A[ρ ^ (-1/5)][e ^ (1/5)][t ^ (2/5)]

Solve for e:

e = A'(r ^ 5)ρ(t ^ -2)

Values for A', and t:

A was experimentally determined to be 1 (If I remember correctly


r is difficult to determine but I gave it my best shot as I will articulate below.  If you can extrapolate a better estimate for r then please feel free to chime in and make it more accurate.  Some of the following pictures will be **SERIOUSLY NSFL** but I needed to view them to find the radius of the blast at a given time t.  This analysis is for the first explosion located [here](http://i.imgur.com/tHbnNq8.jpg).  [Here](http://imgur.com/V3dd0gF) is an overhead view of the location that had the bomb.  The area in red is where I reasonably determined the blast should have taken place based on the best images I could find.  If you notice [here](http://imgur.com/scis9EV) it appears the the restaurant railing was impacted by a shock wave.  If the blast was directly in front of the rail then the interference pattern should look like [this](http://imgur.com/HgWxAIv).  This seemed plausible but not precise; also

If 1800m/s is correct then:

r = 3m

t = .00167s

If 3000m/s is correct then

r = 3m

t = .001s


Finding ρ:

It was about 15 degrees C when the blast occurred today so [ρ = 1.2250](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_of_air).  There was also significant humidity that I didn't yet factor into ρ (mostly because it's getting late and I'm tired) that will reduce the density of air so I will leave it to the good people of r/physics to pick up my slack here.


Solving: If 1800m/s


e = A'*(r ^ 5)ρ(t ^ -2)

e = (1)(3 ^ 5)(1.2250)(.00167 ^ -2)

e = 1x10 ^ 8 Joules


If 3000m/s is correct:

e = A'(r ^ 5)ρ(t ^ -2)

e = (1)(3 ^ 5)(1.2250)(.001 ^ -2) = 3x10 ^ 8 Joules


I'm too tired to figure out which types of explosive devices produce energy that fit in that range so I'll leave it for you to help me with.  Please correct me on any errors and hopefully we can help the NYPD bring these criminals to justice.

I am a graduate student in her lab and what I read in the comments was a little painful. I'm not at all bothered by those that claim no knowledge of physics and make very amusing comments about light sabers and Bose-Einstein Condensates being the power source for Bose Speakers (that was actually pretty funny). But I was shocked at how many semi-educated people made the claim that:

**when light enters matter

This is wrong. Very wrong.

Classically it would somehow say that Maxwell's equations require absorption/emission and atomic structure in some way. They do not. A free electron gas still has an index of refraction (so do plasmas and other non atomic systems). **Scattering destroys the coherency of light**. 

Quantum mechanically
This is a huge misconception and I hope we can

This post had noting to do with EIT and or slow light. But I feel like I should also mention that slow light is not ""just shining a laser into a dense Bose-Einstein Condensate"" as some claimed. BEC's have densities MUCH lower than most solids and the index of refraction inside one is so close to 1 as to make no difference. 
I can do an /r/physics ama with some other members of the lab if you guys actually want to know more about slow light and EIT.

**edit**: Thank you all for your responses. I wrote this as a small rant on the misconception and didn't indent to make any claims as the true nature of the light matter interaction (a subject in which I feel comfortable enough to discuss but not comfortable enough to make any sure claims). I am extremely please with the responses and have actually learn quite a bit from them (particularly from seasidesarawack

D’Arline

I adore you

I know how much you like to hear that — but I don't only write it because you like it — I write it because it makes me warm all over inside to write it to you. 

It is such a terribly long time since I last wrote to you — almost two years but I know you'll excuse me because you understand how I am

But now I know my darling wife that it is right to do what I have delayed in doing

I find it hard to understand in my mind what it means to love you after you are dead — but I still want to comfort and take care of you — and I want you to love me and care for me. I want to have problems to discuss with you — I want to do little projects with you. I never thought until just now that we can do that. What should we do. We started to learn to make clothes together — or learn Chinese — or getting a movie projector. Can't I do something now? No. I am alone without you and you were the ""idea-woman"" and general instigator of all our wild adventures.

When you were sick you worried because you could not give me something that you wanted to and thought I needed. You needn’t have worried. Just as I told you then there was no real need because I loved you in so many ways so much. And now it is clearly even more true — you can give me nothing now yet I love you so that you stand in my way of loving anyone else — but I want you to stand there. You

I know you will assure me that I am foolish and that you want me to have full happiness and don't want to be in my way. I'll bet you are surprised that I don't even have a girlfriend (except you, nor can I — I don't understand it, for I have met many girls and very nice ones and I don't want to remain alone — but in two or three meetings they all seem ashes. You only are left to me. You are real.

My darling wife

I love my wife. My wife is dead.

Rich.

PS Please excuse my not mailing this — but I don't know your new address.""

1313419811.0,jje4t,About Braunstein's paper on gravity being an emergent property.,jmct,330,50,40,"So there have been a few links about the paper published last week in the Physical Review Letters. I've seen the following

[http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jj801/gravity_may_be_an_emergent_property_not_a/](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jj801/gravity_may_be_an_emergent_property_not_a/)

[http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jg10j/gravity_itself_may_be_emergent_properties_within/](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jg10j/gravity_itself_may_be_emergent_properties_within/)

[http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jhpvv/new_study_by_scientists_at_the_university_of_york/](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jhpvv/new_study_by_scientists_at_the_university_of_york/) 


So notice all of these are in /r/science but none actually point to the paper. Luckily for us the Physical Review Letters allows for the author to host a copy on their personal website to be legally downloaded and read by anyone (not all journals allow this). 

Here is his personal website with a link to the paper:

[Prof. Braunstein's publications](http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~schmuel/cv.html)

The relevant paper is publication #117 (the top one at the time of writing this).

Now, it is crucial that you read the supplementary materials that is also linked on his page. He said equation #3 and its rationale are a crucial part of the result. 

So I made this post because I didn't think that /r/science linking to places like Huffington Post and judging the work based on an article written by a journalist that probably only read the abstract was the best way to have a well-reasoned discussion about the paper. 

I may be able to pass on questions to Prof. Braunstein but I can't promise I'll be able to in a timely matter as he may not be in very much this week.

My gut feeling was 'not quite,  which turns out to be non-trivial. I needed Mathematica to do the job for me. For those interested, read  on! It's a fun derivation and I thought I would share it with you guys. Maybe it will inspire some other related questions or discussion. I wonder if gym equipment engineers optimise the equipment mathematically or by 'build and test'?

I set the problem up like so,y)* fixed:

[Figure 1](http://i.imgur.com/iiHdc.png).

I am interested in the locus that the red cross traces as the angle theta ranges from 0 to 2Pi.

In my notation

    (d Cos[t] + r (p - d Cos[t])

The coordinates *(p, d Sin[t])* of radius *l*; the second centred at *(x,y)* of radius *a*. There will be two intersection points, only one of which refers to the *(p,q)* we are interested in (the lower one). Thus, *p* and *q* satisfy the equations:

    (p - d Cos[t])^2 + (q - d Sin[t])^2 = l^2; 
    (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = a^2

We can solve simultaneously to find *(p,a,d,r,x,y,theta)*. Then we can parametrically plot for *theta=[0
*l=1.5, r=0.5, x=1.5, y=0.5*.

The Mathematica output looks like this:

[Figure 2](http://i.imgur.com/RQk5D.png)

There are the two solutions I was talking about. You're doing it wrong if your elliptical trainer traces out the upper solution! The physical solution is the blue one which is almost elliptical but not quite.

So there you have it: the answer in fact is 'not quite

[Figure 3](http://i.imgur.com/Cn7ro.png)

Any other neat geometrical problems you guys can think of

**TL;DR:** [Not quite](http://i.imgur.com/RQk5D.png) (blue locus).

1362959580.0,1a1tki,Decided to end with my Masters. Here's Why.,Luminescence9,295,75,102,"Preface: There has been a lot of talk on this subreddit about careers, schools

I came to the realization that my life has largely been without adventure. I've never left the states, no wife, no children and as soon as I get my masters, no more grad school. If I were to stay in grad school til I get my PhD., I'd be nearly 30 before I had my degree and chances are I'd have a wife, possible child, and a job lined up. Responsibility. 

As I see it

My current plan is to spend a month driving down to South America. Spend the following 6 months teaching in one of the 13 countries on the continent. I originally thought about going to Venezuela due to it being relatively close to the string of islands just North of the shore. But with the recent death of Hugo Chavez

This is an experience I view as being more valuable than a PhD. (since I'm hoping for a career outside of academia). Not only will I learn Spanish, teach a new subject (likely English) and submerge myself in a new culture (employers love multilingual cultured folk).

On top of this, tests, papers, campus, passionless students, uncaring professors, etc... Every day I'm sitting at my desk, grading or working on homework, driving my motorcycle up and down the coast

I've worked hard to be where I am. But where I've ended up I'm not happy. I love the physics but I hate the stress. I'm ready to be done. I'm ready to see the world and grow as a person.

Does anyone else feel the same? Done what I've talked about? Suggestions from those who have?

Edit: On a positive note, the peace of mind in knowing that I'll have a pretty awesome degree to fall back on if anything goes awry is awesome. And after this journey is over I'm extremely confident I will find an excellent job with little effort. In the end I hope to find work in the alternative energy market. Not sure what I'll do just yet, but I'm pretty sure it'll be awesome. Maybe setting up wind turbines in developing countries. That would be neat.

Those of you who are college students in the US and members of SPS

In an effort to help spread the word about recent physics and to help the community of physics students, we've decided to try to reach out to various online communities. We're already on Facebook and now we're turning to Reddit. We aren't trying to get subscriptions, we just want to share some of our content that we think would be interesting and helpful to the members of the /r/physics sub. Our online content ranges from brief discussions of new articles, to providing information about career and education path options, to highlighting government policies around the world that affect physicists. And we also publish online versions of the print magazine, but some of that content is paywalled (though there are occasional periods where we make all our content free), so I'm generally going to avoid posting the stuff the non-subscribers won't be able to access.

We don't plan on spamming the sub with content, maybe not happily because we do so want to be loved) go away.

Furthermore, how the Higgs boson's mass doesn't blow up from quadratic loop corrections.  And probably a lot more I don't remember.  The Standard Model works brilliantly and explains a lot... but for many decades, perhaps even from its first concept, people have known that there is more unknown physics lying at higher energies.

I can't remember his name but I think he was head of the accelerator group at CERN. Anthony was his first name I think...

First off he said (without actually saying it) that they are close to detecting the Higgs Boson. They had a shut down scheduled for 2012 (for Armageddon I think) and  are considering postponing it because the people at ATLAS and CMS think that they will have enough data to confidently say they have detected it. He mentioned they are waiting for 3.5 sigma confidence before announcing  so I thought that implied that they already had *some* candidate detections. So don't expect an announcement this month

He mentioned a few times how well the machine is running. Over the past 2 years they have ramped up the beam current (number of particles) and energy extremely fast (faster then planned). They have achieved a luminosity twice that which was predicted (ie the particle bunches have been squeezed smaller than they thought possible.

One cool fact he pulled up is that when they dump the beam they release 4 tetrawatts of power

As you may have heard, not to mention, was accredited to anonymous sources.

For something like this, it is always a good idea to wait for news from the source. OPERA has released a statement which is included in [THIS](http://io9.com/5887601/cern-and-opera-address-loose-cables-effect-on-faster+than+light-neutrino-readings/) article which basically says that, yes there may be a cable situation, but there may also be another error that will affect the result in the opposite direction [making the neutrino velocity even faster than before]. These errors could cancel or could move the result in either direction.

These types of experiments [extremely high precision measurements] and will require several months to sort out the issues. Why? Because they want to be sure. They want to avoid silly news cycles based on speculation based on rumors. Unfortunately

Even in the event that this result is nullified either at OPERA or Fermilab or Super-K or elsewhere, etc. These aren't due to incorrect laws of physics, but incorrect measurements. Correctly done science, however, checks every component, looks for every possible source of error to explain the difficult result, and admits when they're wrong.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/q2oh4/as_people_on_reddit_are_racing_to_take_bake_their/

The class is introductory. It covers trig, work/energy/power, simple harmonic motion, a bit of electricity, and the last unit is a **very** brief intro to special relativity. 

The material is covered in a fairly novel way

I'm very excited about the class! It was a lot of fun to teach

But they aren't physicists! I would really love to have some feedback on the course

* Are the motivating questions for each unit effective?
* Is the density of content appropriate?
* What about the density of quizzes? I'm worried they may be too frequent.

I know this is a lot to ask

Thanks in advance for any suggestions/feedback! Feel free to ask me any questions about Udacity and online education in general.

[Molecular vibration-sensing component in Drosophila melanogaster olfaction](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/02/08/1012293108.abstract)

&gt; A common explanation of molecular recognition by the olfactory system posits that receptors recognize the structure or shape of the odorant molecule. We performed a rigorous test of shape recognition by replacing hydrogen with deuterium in odorants and asking whether Drosophila melanogaster can distinguish these identically shaped isotopes. We report that flies not only differentiate between isotopic odorants, selectively avoid the corresponding isotope of a different odorant. Finally, flies trained to avoid a deuterated compound exhibit selective aversion to an unrelated molecule with a vibrational mode in the energy range of the carbon–deuterium stretch. These findings are inconsistent with a shape-only model for smell, and instead **support the existence of a molecular vibration-sensing component to olfactory reception**.",,False,,True,t3_pp07c

Basically

This paper takes the opposite approach by accepting the geometric basis of unrestricted general relativity without caveats. Thus, but a hitting a pool ball where an arbitrary number of wormholes are interspersed across the table can introduce a near infinite number of possible trajectories.

A more layman's introduction is linked to from the above paper:

http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9609021

Compelling predictions of this theory:

 * There is no quantum theory of gravity.
 * Classical objects are possible. The peculiar 4-geon structures give rise to quantum effects; if these are absent then classical deterministic evolution would occur.
 * There is no graviton. This follows from either of the statements above. Gravitational waves are topologically simple solutions of Einstein’s equations without CTCs. Therefore they cannot exhibit quantum phenomena such as wave particle duality. Gravitational waves are not quantised.

Aside from the fact that our department is graduating twelve or thirteen students this May, **and** we bring in lots of money in grants, we are **still** likely to be cut if we do not quickly change members of the administration and state government's minds.

Understanding and being able to derive equations from more fundamental principles is of course foremost in learning physics but you should memorize things too. After all, if you commit a formula to memory, then you can look at it and think about it whenever you want, instead of just when you have your textbook open. It seems to be common knowledge on Reddit that great epiphanies happen in the most unexpected circumstances, like in the shower, or standing at the bus stop, or right before falling asleep. Therefore, you can ruminate on it at a lot more short frequent intervals (rather than in one long boring study session)

The second big reason for memorizing formulas is that when you have an equation immediately accessible to you, or having forgotten about the 3D continuity equation you learned in EM when you see a new high dimensional phase-space continuity equation appear in statistical mechanics, will severely limit your understanding and your ability to see the more fundamental unities between physical laws, and your appreciation of how beautiful physics really is will not mature nearly as quickly as it otherwise could.

Okay, as long as it's in addition, instead of in place of, your understanding, memorization will seriously help you out. It may seem a little daunting at first, but trust me, you will get better at memorizing as time goes on. In fact, if nothing else,False,

When i was hit my legs hit the front of the car which tossed my head and arm into the windshield. I landed back on my feet and collapsed to the ground and did not roll.

The speed limit on the road was 35mph(15.65 m/s) if he was driving at normal speed. The car stopped 200ft after hitting me. 

 I do not know exactly how high i was hit into the air yet still trying to confirm that with people who saw this happen. I was hit 10ft into the air doing somersaults in the air

The car in question is 57"" tall and weights 3224 lbs(1462.4 kg)

1304188098.0,h0xud,Dark Matter vs. Dark Energy or why the current nomenclature is terrible,spartanKid,143,17,91,"Dark Matter and Dark Energy seem to get lumped together a lot as placeholders for stuff we just don't know anything about. Yet

We see evidence for Dark Matter in all different scales of the Universe from all different epochs. The Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), but not electromagnetically interacting particle fluid in the early primordial plasma. The Cosmic Microwave Background power spectrum also hints at the existence of significantly more non-baryonic matter in the Universe. Having a flat Universe entirely made up of Baryons does not fit the power spectrum measured by COBE or WMAP. Using Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, which relies on very well understood nuclear and atomic physics, predicts certain ratios and abundances of H, He and Li in the Universe, the concentrations of which would be distorted by the presence of extra baryonic matter. Strong Gravitational Lensing requires the existence of much more matter than we can measure using luminosity and other measurements. Lastly, the most commonly cited reason is that measured galaxy rotation speeds do not match those predicted by GR and Newtonian physics.

Fitting and reproducing galaxy rotation curves is where MOND or Modified Newtonian Dynamics, Grav Lensing, BBN, and rotation curve measurements. Basically if you want your MOND theory to work at a certain level, you have to introduce 4 other modifications to physical theory for everything to work out. Allowing for the existence of a dark matter particle is the simplest and most reductionist view of ""dark matter problem"".

There have been many candidates for the particle dark matter. A very early candidate were MACHOs, normal baryonic matter, but didn't absorb or emit light. Even when accounting for black holes and other MACHOs, they don't make up enough energy-mass density to fix the dark matter problem. 

WIMPs, then they have some low but non-zero coupling constant with the nuclei of atoms, meaning they can collide and scatter. This is the basic premise of experiments like CDMS (II), XENON100, and DAMA/LiBRA, etc. 

Other dark matter candidates, etc. are not pursued as heavily or as publicized because it's really much more difficult to detect them, directly or indirectly. 

If the dark matter candidate only interacts gravitationally

Right now is an exciting time because of the coming of age of the LHC, or lightest stable supersymmetric partner, in many SUSY models is an excellent dark matter candidate. The energies of the LHC are just now reaching the point where they're parameter space overlaps with upcoming direct detection dark matter experiments.

So, know an awful lot about the properties of dark matter and have finitely many models and theories waiting to be confirmed or disproven from the LHC and DM direct detection experiments. 

**EDIT**: Dark Energy is what we believe to be the other ~74% of the Universe, during radiation domination, we could expect to see the Universe expanding outward due to the immense radiation pressure and heat. Common intuition would lead one to believe the expansion of the Universe would slow down once we reach the matter dominated regime, and the gravity starts to pull everything back together. However this does not appear to be the case, and objects that are further away are receding faster and faster as a function of redshift. We name this mysterious driving force and the other 74% of the energy-mass density to be ""Dark Energy""

Dark energy is much more of a mystery than dark matter

So please, and that our confidence in the existence of dark matter is much higher than our confidence level in any statement we can make about dark energy, except for that something out there exists that maintains constant energy density, even under expansion of the Universe. 


**DOUBLE EDIT:** I certainly hope that when we find out more about DM and DE, axions, sterile neutrinos, quintessence, vacuum energy, etc.

This is not true, and usually difficult to understand for individuals that do not already understand entanglement.

To make this as simple as possible, with a spin of zero. The particle decays into two other particles, each in a superposition of spin=1 and spin=-1. These particles are entangled. When you measure the spin of one particle, it's wavefunction collapses to the observed state. Let's say we find that it's spin is 1. The moment we observe this, the other particle's wavefunction collapses as well, and as soon as its spin is observed, we, know that it will be -1. The collapse of the wavefunction happens instantaneously

Here is the thing. I observe the first particle, particle B, even light-years away, has spin -1. However, as far as anyone that can observe particle B knows, I haven't yet observed particle A. They observe particle B, and they see the spin is -1. They have no idea if I have observed particle A yet. If you think that we could make it so that particle B is in an apparatus that would register when the wave-function is collapsed, because in order to monitor changes in B

It is also important to note, measure something else about A, and then find A has a spin of -1, B still has a spin of -1, unless something has independently acted on B to change it.

I saw a couple of days ago the exciment behind the publication of the Higgs search papers from ATLAS and CMS and I wanted to make a few comments. Let me know what you think.

My main point is: nowadays in high-energy physics

Although I'm not a member of ATLAS or CMS I can tell you how the reviewing process usually works inside a big collaboration: First, this is a small set of people that have worked on something similar to what you're doing. For example, you may be looking for a Higgs to 2 photons, so there may be a ""diphoton working group"" that deals with all these analyses. If you have something very important, like a five sigma (very statistically significant) discovery, they will be shooting questions from every angle (was your simulation right? have you made sure that your cuts are not biasing your result? etc etc). The questions from this group are usually the best, since they know what you're dealing with AND they know the detector too. Here you already have a ""peer-review"" process even before publication.

Then, your colleagues at your institution that know about your work) because if you have a juicy result somebody may want to attack it for political reasons (this happens in science as in any other place, gasp!). If your results are good and you've done your homework you won't have major problems passing this step.

Now you write the paper, questions. There's a lot of peer-reviewing in this phase too.

OK, a lot) about the subject at hand. How many reviewers does a usual paper get? 2, or 3. I don't know if this is true in the case of the Higgs papers but that's it!

At the same time, and theorists will try to come up with explanations as to why what you're seeing is what they've been predicting all along (and sometimes they're right! double-gasp!). Also, some experimentalists may try to argue that you did something wrong. Maybe not. For the Higgs, this step happened on July 31st. 

From July 31st until a few days ago the paper underwent the journal review. More comments were submitted and some were incorporated with some clarifications in the text of the paper. Now comes the publication and the realease of the journal version of the paper. Usually people will update the arxiv with the latest version of the paper.

Here's then my point: Since the birth of the very first draft of the paper, many tens of people that know exactly what you're talking about, and know exactly what your detector can and can not do. Then it goes to thousands of people (like for the LHC experiments) where it is reviewed again, also by people who can very easily detect problems in your analysis because they work with the same data, on the same experiments, and you meet them regularly maybe twice a year in a big meeting and also have phone conferences with them. You'll be under attack for a while there.

Then you move to a journal and 2 (two) people who don't know all the details of your data or your detector argue with you until you get some references in, or want to see a different plot.

Guess where the ""actual science"" happened?

I'm not downplaying the importance of the reviewing process, the reviewing started a long time ago, and I'm almost certain not much changed between the arxiv submission and the journal publication. 
For somebody in physics who's not in the LHC

Sorry for the long rant

TL;DR: Passing peer-reviewing for the ATLAS and CMS results is a non-event in terms of what it means for everybody else in physics.

Dear ________
 
I invite you to take 5 minutes of your time and visit my website. I was recommended to contact you by your co-worker, and other very important universal formulas. I have sent my formulas to NASA also and am waiting for a response. I am hoping that you take interest in my formulas and let the public know about this new information. Please click on the website highlighted below and then click on introduction/all to see all my formulas.

 
You will realize the importance of my formulas and recognize how the country and NASA could benefit by a better, universities, scientific institutes and NASA programs.
 
On my website
First:    The new speed of light formula for the first time in Science history.
 
              V2=R” x g x V/ 3600     V= 189
 
Second: three new gravity formulas based on the planet radius
rotational speed

     a- Gravity=2(Planet Density x Planet Radius) / (Planet Speed x Air Radius)=2 (D x R) / (Vs x R’) = 9.7979

     b- Gravity= 4 (p x RVc / R’Vs) = 9.7979

     c- Gravity = 2 (R’ / Vs) = 9.797

My result of my formulas show that the gravity for;
             Earth =9.7979

Third: The Sun has no effect or gravity attraction to a planet because
the sun’s gravity radius is 577
run with 576 ml/h towards the sun, radius or
gravity. My formula proves how many miles each planet will get closer to the
sun. For example the earth will get closer 2
I am proud
I am proud to inform you that after 400 years of when Newton’s formula was
first made
gravitational constant. And I explained why all (9) planets get close to the sun.
This email has been sent to your co-workers and other channel _ reporters.
Please let me know if you would like to schedule an interview.
I look forward to your response.
Thank you

Problem is I only got null results and I got my qualifications all from the same no-name university. No results = no papers. 

There seem to be several jobs which I appear to be suited to, Europe and Australia. I started applying for jobs in companies rather than universities/research institutes but, just like during my thesis experiments, I have yielded null results. I can’t program so I can’t go into finance. 

So I have to wonder what I can do now? I am having a hard time figuring out what I can do with my physics qualifications. If I can’t do research then I can’t think of anything I can do except for minimum wage unskilled work (which I am currently employed doing).

I suppose what gets me down is that I’ve work hard all through high school and university so that I wouldn’t have to earn minimum wage and therefore not have to struggle from paycheque to paycheque. I will keep on trying but if you guys have any ideas for what a PhD in physics can do that’s not research/lab work let me know. Thanks for your advice.

**TL:DR** No papers from PhD = minimum wage job. What else can I do?

[Here is part 1 of the video

Let's just say part 2 is better.  I capture the complete ""flight"" of the bullet under water... all the way till it stops.  So here's my question.  The bullet creates a trail behind it that is pretty amazing. [Check out the 4th row of pictures on this website by Dr. Andrew Davidhazy to visualize what I'm talking about](http://people.rit.edu/andpph/exhibit-3.html).  Obviously there's a low pressure zone behind the bullet, that then collapses.  Originally I thought the gasses from the bullet casing would project out into the bullet's flight trail, but it's really looking like the entire wake area collapses after a few hundred milliseconds, leading me to believe the entire void is cavitation.  **After it collapses, it slams in to nothing, then it re-expands.  This re-expansion is what has me confused.**  I'm thinking it's an interaction of the collapsing pressures in a fluid momentum like fashion, similar to how a collapsing magnetic field will create it's own current if near a conductor.  Either way, but I really want to explain the science correctly.  My intent is to pull up a [phase diagram for water](http://serc.carleton.edu/images/research_education/equilibria/h2o_phase_diagram_-_color.v2.jpg) and explain why it turns to vapor

I'm a physics PhD student at UC Berkeley who is also a teacher and leader for the [Compass Project](http://www.berkeleycompassproject.org/), and better education in physics. It was started in 2006 by a few grad students who ran a summer program in 2007 for about 10 incoming freshmen, and now the program serves over 100 graduate and undergraduate students every year. We have a summer program, semester-long courses, a mentoring program, etc., all run by and for students.

If you're a student in a department with a generally negative culture (e.g., or education) then you should [contact](http://www.berkeleycompassproject.org/contact/) people in Compass to get an idea for how you can effect change even if you're not faculty or staff. We've got over 6 years of experience growing a program and supporting it through tough financial times, and we'd love to share our story with you!

We're already partnering with a university in Florida, who just submitted a grant proposal for a summer program. Some of us will be moving to Phoenix in 2013 to adapt our program for pre-college students (i.e., K-12).

There are several metrics which suggest that we're successful: we won the [APS Physics award](http://www.aps.org/programs/education/undergrad/faculty/awardees.cfm) for Improving Undergraduate Physics Education; we did a [qualitative study](http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.6848) to show that our students feel like they're part of a strong community that supports them holistically as learners and people; we're really [diverse](http://www.berkeleycompassproject.org/about/by-the-numbers/), and 19% first-generation college students; and we have an awesome STEM degree completion rate of 84%, which is more than twice the national average of [40%](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-engage-to-excel-final_feb.pdf).

&gt;**The Rayleigh–Taylor Instability**

&gt;When you turn a bottle of mineral water upside down

&gt;If the bottom surface of the water remained perfectly flat, there is slightly less water pressing on the top of the ripple than elsewhere, and the balance between the weight of the water above the ripple and the atmospheric pressure is upset. The larger the ripple grows, the greater is the unbalance, and the ripple grows faster. 

&gt;Eventually, the water does not fall out because surface tension
prevents the interface from deforming like that.
