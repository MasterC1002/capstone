I know this is a lot of text, so I won't get butthurt if you disagree.











As I promised

In this document I will try and cover different levels of clothing companies and also try to give you guys projected costs for starting a brand

A little intro

Levels of clothing companies
These are only things as seen through my eyes. Feel free to disagree.
(I will provide some links to the supplies that I am talking about at the end of the post).  

Remember this, and the cost of producing clothing. You could be at any one of these levels with other amounts of money that funds your company. You could be at an intermediate level with $300 in your pocket. It all depends on how committed you are and how you use your money. Try and use it wisely!

Beginner: ($200 or lower)
	What I interpret this level as, inks, and everything else you need to print shirts. Spreading your brand to others outside of your circle isn’t priority number one. 

Novice: ($200-400)
	You have some cool designs that you want to put on shirts. You have friends that would buy and support your company, shirts and hoodies can be printed. Everything is done by you, but in small batches because you don’t have a lot of money to create a collection from the start. Products are released whenever they can be, and there’s nothing wrong with that as a starting clothing line that’s all created by you. Don’t feel pressured to start with 5+ pieces if money is a concern. Just release high quality and genuine pieces as you can and focus on that later. 

Intermediate: ($400-1
	This level is not as much of a side job, but with a higher budget you can focus on designing and advertising as others produce clothing for you. This level is where there will be more variety in items as you have more money to put into the company. Maybe caps, beanies, hoodies, and shirts are made to kick off your clothing company. You could outsource work for caps and accessories to China if that’s what you want to do, and keep printing local. You have a lot more flexibility with a higher budget. 

Advanced: ($1
	This is going to be your job. You are more than determined to create a clothing brand and spread it into shops and hopefully open a physical storefront when you can afford it. There is a lot more clothing that is produced. Custom labels, and a LOT more variety in clothing. Seasonal collections that include more than a handful of items. All of your time is spent on your clothing company. At this point your eat, sleep, and breath your brand. I have not gotten close to being at this point, so anyone who has, please comment and we can edit this document with advice. 


Equipment and resources!

Here you will find equipment that is common in creating clothing and some links to places that will gladly produce clothing for you!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some items on this list is me assuming you want to do as much of if yourself. It’s all personal preference. I like to do as much myself as possible. I do the minor sewing
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Manual silkscreen press.
-Squeegee for spreading ink across the screen.
-Spatula for the ink.
-Ink
-Heat gun to cure ink (only if you want to speed up the process).
-Silkscreens.
-Light box
	-This is a lot more complicated if you are just working out of your house. I would recommend that you ask a local print shop if they would be willing to burn your design onto a screen of your choice for you instead. Saves time and it will be done right. Anthem screen-printing in San Francisco offers this service. 
-A basic sewing machine to sew on custom tags and such if that  is what you are planning. If you are putting tags onto cotton shirts, you won’t need anything expensive. 

For leather: I do all of my leatherwork myself. I make every leather logo that goes on my items so here is a list of what I use if this is something you want to do. There are other places to get these supplies

-Sharp x acto knife for cutting.
Just search for a high quality one. 

-Overstitch roller.
http://www.tandyleatherfactory.com/en-usd/home/department/tools/8091-00.aspx

-Stitching awl for making holes for the thread.
http://www.tandyleatherfactory.com/en-usd/home/department/tools/31218-01.aspx

-Leather stamp with your logo on it.

1375729144.0,1jr9yd,Weekly Brand Discussion: Been Trill,BenPup,48,11,74,"Been Trill. Been Trill is a fairly new brand that has been getting its name out there in a loud way. They have done several collaborations with multiple companies ranging from Stussy to Hood By Air to Diamond Supply Co. 

Who is Been Trill? Been Trill is a collective of artists featuring Matthew Williams, Justin Saunders, and YWP. They are artists, art directors, visual curators and designers first and DJs second.

 Their products consist mainly of hats and graphic tees

 The two most notable products of theirs have been the series of Hood By Air collaboration tees ( http://imgur.com/a/kMxuc ) and the 40oz NYC snapback which came in multiple colors (  http://imgur.com/a/lsgDz ). 


For more ideas of what their designs are check out their website ( beentrillbeentrill.com ), Been Trill announced that they would have exclusive tees at PacSun. The whole community exploded when this was announced. Most hated it. Others laughed. It went from spending $100 on a graphic tee printed on Gildan to $30 for a screenprinted tee made in America. It was a bold move on Been Trills part, and some of their fans took it as a slap in the face. Then to make things more dramatic, they announced a collaboration with Diamond Supply Co., which again would be PacSun exclusive. 


So what do you think of the brand? Good? Bad? Lame? Did they sell out? Do you like their designs or collabs? What do you think the future has for Been Trill?

I thought I would give you guys a look into my own clothing brand that I am relaunching called [Features Clothing Co](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Features-Clothing-Co/447154825349481?fref=ts)

It has been in the works for a while now after I changed my company name and I am proud to say I will be ready for release in the coming month if there are no more delays. A lot of work has gone into this upcoming release of my company so hopefully you guys appreciate it :)

Since I have posted about how to start up a brand I thought I would show the process here. 

Here are my fabrics: I have chosen to go with a spring critters theme for my first drop paired with a woodsy colored woven cloth. I hand sourced the printed fabric from a fabric retailer here in LA and as for the woven fabric
http://imgur.com/gJ4goHE

Here is a close-up of the woven cloth:
http://imgur.com/tzTzyqL

Just picking a fabric isn't easy at all. I know I talked about stock fabrics in an earlier post, and that's not even half of what I have here....
http://imgur.com/bqa1ARf

After finally determining your fabrics, but due to complications I won't be using them for the first couple drops due to the leather. Here are pictures of the stamp I had created and what the finished product looked like:

The stamp:
http://imgur.com/JMfRY9s


The finished product:
http://imgur.com/3pJFwPF

These will be used in a future release with a thinner leather, and hats. 


Here is a picture of the sample label (the finals ones have less space between the image and edges).
http://imgur.com/znwWqhc



So these are the pieces that make up the hat

Here are the pics:
http://imgur.com/kPOkaq2
http://imgur.com/bnpGt93

You can notice the second hat has more of a shape to it. I fused the fabric so it would retain its shape. 

Of course there are some others things to consider when you are trying to start your own line. If you decide to go through a factory you can have them use their fabric or you just send yours and then you have a produced hat. There is nothing wrong with that but I chose a different approach.


The reasons I chose to get as involved in my hats as possible and have them made-to-order is simple. I want my company to release high quality clothing. Yes, I want to be as involved in the process of creation as I can :)

I will post some more updates as things get closer to release. I just wanted to show you guys what I have been doing.  Like everything



Cheers

Straight from the website:
Diamond Supply Co. was founded in 1998 when Nicholas Tershay (aka Nick Diamond) created a skateboarding hardware line from his humble one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco. In 2000, bearings, t-shirts, fleece, accessories and more. Having a strong design aesthetic, and a commitment for creating high quality goods, Diamond Supply Co. was quickly embraced by skate and street fashion communities alike.

In 2005, and hailed as one of the greatest Nike SB’s of all-time by esteemed publications and collectors alike.

In 2013

Diamond Supply Co. has an elite team roster of more than 100 of the best skateboarders in the World, Stevie Williams, Torey Pudwill, Nyjah Huston, and more.

**What did you wear today?**

Thanks those of you that participated in yesterdays WDYWT! I think I'll make this a daily thing now. Please upvote for visibility as I don't get karma and everyone looking on the frontpage can see it and provide to the thread!

Please list what you're wearing from top to bottom and link to a picture of preferably you wearing the clothing. If you don't want to be in a picture then lay the clothing out on a table or the floor instead of like a bed or couch.

The best layout would be something like: Supreme / Levi / Nike, and some nikes.

Once again please provide feedback on peoples fits and if someone really likes what you're wearing and wants a link please provide one or at least the name of the piece.

Have fun and I hope everyone has a good Sunday.

I noticed there are quite a few people on this subreddit that have created their own clothing lines which is awesome! 

For people who have created clothing, that is if you want to produce items such as hats and some embroidered goods. Or you can go the DIY way and print your own shirts, which takes practice. 

Whatever method people use to create their own clothes, equipment, or anything that is used to produce clothing.

For me it was frustrating trying to contact people asking for help with manufacturers and getting cussed out for trying to learn their manufacturing ""secrets"". I think hiding this information is bullshit as we should all have a chance to do what we love

First of all

In order to make any sales at all

I wasn't a good drawer, I always got A's on my projects in school, so I thought this should be easy!

Wrong.

First of all

Designing a logo, etc. was easy.

What wasn't easy is investing your own money into this. A big mistake that many small companies make is that they buy lots of inventory (let's say, and have all those t-shirts laying around.

You just lost money.

I wasn't sure if I wanted to risk that, my strategy was that once a person makes the order of a product from my website, I'll make the order from VistaPrint and have them ship the item directly to my customer. It was effective, but I didn't make much profit from it since my designs were **full print** and it was an order of only 1 t-shirt, rather if I would have ordered 5 or more, the price of per t-shirt would drop.

So I had a design of a t-shirt on my website, so if it costed $23 to make the t-shirt and ship it to the customer, I should be making $7 profit, right?

Nope, meaning I got $28.34 or something like that rather than a full $30.

Now

A full print is when the design concludes of multiple colors

When a one color print t-shirt design costs $4 per t-shirt

I was bad at drawing in general, and problems were arising of how I was going to advertise my company, and it was just really stressful when you don't know what you're doing.

It's complex and hard

I wouldn't this was a waste of time

Today I was almost mugged and shortly after had a gun pointed at my face. I'm safe with all of my possessions now. 

My life literally flashed before my eyes. 

Just be thankful for what you have and know it could all end in a second. Always do your best and when you look at your past you should be happy about every single thing that you've accomplished and have no regrets.  

Always put more then 100% into whatever you do. Fuck it. Put more than 200% into it. I feel like I have more motivation to do my absolute best now with my company and everything I do. 

Things like this make you thankful for what you have.

As I'm sure is the case with all of you, I realised something is missing: a comprehensive guide to the locations of these stores. Me and my girlfriend used unlike city guides and Hypebeast's store guides to find stores but found stores weren't open any more and those that were still open, were almost impossible to find. All too often the store locations are just too hard to find even if you have the address. As such, I want your help. This week I will be starting an exhaustive guide to the locations of streetwear stores in central London and compiling it into a custom map on Google Maps. I urge everyone who has good knowledge of streetwear stores in their city to do the same and between us we can help others getting lost so much in our cities.

The guidelines I will be using when creating my guide are as follows:

    Include photos of store front

    Include photos of the side view of the store

    Mark location on custom Google Maps

    Include directions from the nearest subway/train station

    Mark landmarks on Google Maps so you know you're on track

    Make instructions descriptive. For example, now turn left..."" Think more like a video game tutorial than a guidebook

    Include brief descriptions of which brands etc. are stocked but remember this guide is primarily concerned with explaining locations of the stores.

    Date stamp whenever possible to keep the guide current. If a store closes down

Any suggestions on what can be added or changed to these guidelines to improve the quality of such a guide is welcomed",,t5_2sgoq,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/streetwear/comments/1ccmh6/a_comprehensive_guide_to_street_wear_store/

The caps arrived within the following 2 weeks and I am very content with the outcome.

The first hat I ordered was the ""Whistler"" (already sold out). The cap has an [extremly dope print](http://i.imgur.com/iBiNTOZ.jpg) and came out [very well](http://i.imgur.com/kVXfy7g.jpg). Sadly it is a bit hard to pull off but it works with white or navy blue clothes.

The second hat I ordered (and got for free) is just called ""11"". 
I like it even more than the ""Whistler"" one because it's so simple but so tight. The Cap is plain black and got a [violet patterned brim](http://i.imgur.com/ZNDMu7G.jpg) &lt;-- sorry for the small pic you can see it [better on their website](http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91990982/max_h-1000+max_w-1000/4.1.JPG).

All in all the caps are awesome

A friend of mine who ordered [another cap](http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/91990346/max_h-1000+max_w-1000/3.1.JPG) from brightlights had the problem that the cap started to [wrinkle in the rain](http://i.imgur.com/5bEMwz5.jpg). The problem was solved as he dry aired the cap

I'm bored as fuck in my lecture hall and am tired of listening to my teacher. 

So I feel like posting something I find mildly interesting.


What do you guys think about companies that use stock fabrics? Especially in the 5 panel game.

As I scour the internet every night for fabrics while slowly decaying in my chair dressed in a dirty wife beater and boxers

This is mainly predominant in companies that manufacture 5 panel/camp hats (whatever you prefer). I can even say I am guilty of using such easily accessible fabrics. I won't deny it. As a small company that is solely funded by myself, how much work or thought can you really say went into the development of a hat? We all know that in reality we look around, buy fabric, send it to a manufacturer, and hazah! You have a hat. I know this is a VERY broad generalization, but think about it. I have respect for a lot of companies out there, but recently The Quiet Life released their Au Natural pack. If you know fabric and designers you could immediately tell that is a standard Alexander Henry fabric that you can buy for under $10 a yard. I found a link to buy it within a minute. 

http://www.modes4u.com/en/kawaii/p10304_Pin-up-women-in-nature-fabric-by-Alexander-Henry.html

I am in no way trying to bash companies, how involved are we really as designers of these caps?

Maybe it's my lack of sleep over the last week that caused me to rant

My lecture is about to end so I will talk to you guys later.

Cheers


Spencer

We offer discounts and etc, you better do the same with every other brand/site that does it also.  This isn't about profits to me, this is a side job.  This is about bringing REAL streetwear to people.  Independent, real shit to people, without charging high prices.  When we first came here the sub loved it!  We came out the gate throwing discounts, but hey it's all good.  I want to thank everyone on this sub and the mods!  I really think this sub is to mainstream (at times).  We are done here.

I managed to check the store out today and was extremely excited when I was finally able to see brands like 10 Deep and HUF (both of which brands I really love the style of) right in front of my eyes :D

Thought I should spoil myself a little bit

* Fitted Fridays.  Simple right?  Snap a picture of the gear you're rocking on Friday.  If it expresses your lifestyle drop a line and let us know!  

* It would be dope if everyone would interact.  Great way for everyone to share ideas.

I would ideally place the order for all of the caps by myself and just release them to the public

Due to this I won't be able to fund the production of my hats that I've spent so much time working on. I've thought of things such as kick starter but as a full time student who also has a job I am worried I won't be able to fulfill the gifts for donators in a timely fashion. I want to be able to guarantee a product in a timely fashion. 

I plan on retailing these hats for ~$46usd. The only thing is that I would need a certain amount of pre-orders to order the run of caps since there is a minimum.

What I've been working on is setting up a way to allow people to create custom caps (I know it's something that isn't too hard to find online). These caps would be competitively priced and there would be options for five panels, fitteds, and more in the future. It would start out with fabric that you can send in or pay a little extra to have a fabric designed just for you. 

My goal isn't to make a lot of money off of this

The main reason I want to do this is because I've had a lot of disappointing experiences with custom cap companies and also had POOR customer service when it came to communication. I don't want others to experience that. 

I am also thinking of offering a service that will allow small clothing companies to manufacture caps through me with no MOQ (minimum order quantity for people who don't know). Of course the pricing would go down when more hats are ordered. This would just be an alternative to buying 50 caps of one design at a time. 

Let me know what you guys think. I am working on getting just blank caps made of each model that I would offer and I am working on a site as well.
