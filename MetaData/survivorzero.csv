SURVIVOR ZERO FAQ

-Engine-

Unity
	
Engines such as UDK or Source aren’t optimized for large worlds. It lacks proper content streaming, in a separate thread, so they'll load just out of your view as you get closer to them.


-Support-

Windows/OSX
	Unity allows for a lot of support on a variety of devices, and mobile devices. The Unity team is working to add in Linux support, so that is a possibility in the future as well.

-Coding-

We are currently coding Survivor0 in C#

-Why won’t we take your money right now? Are we selling it?- 

We currently do not have a business model for the release of this game. 
We’d like to wait until we have something releasable before we decide that and/or to take donations; if the team fails to make the game in a reasonable timeframe

-Whats the character viewpoint?-

We are making this game in First Person View

-Setting-

the game setting is not taking place in any real world location. It is going to be procedurally generated: terrain/items/zombies/roads buildings

-What is the game type?-

We’re making a game about freedom, and zombies! As the name might hint at, it is a game that focuses on survival. Rather than be a combat-oriented run and gun game, we are designing it so attacking zombies head on will likely have consequences. Guns will be hard to find and ammo will be scarce. We also want to incorporate different game modes later on, post production to cater to different players tastes and let them truly customize their experience.

-Will there be multiplayer?-

We are aiming to have a server based co-op mode. We don’t know how many players right now

-How customizable will the game be?-

We are aiming to make an extensive options menu so you can play a game to your liking. 

-is there item crafting?-

Yes. Expect details in the future!

-How far are you in to development?-

Two months

-How can I help you?-

I don't want to cover everything in this first post

Pros:

** The game world is big

I'm suspecting a lot of the budget went into making the world the way it is.  There is lots of detail, perhaps 

** Zombies show damage well*

Flesh burns away

**Cons:**

** Combat is very “gamey.”*

Lots of button mashing, etc.

There is little more depth in the combat system than the original Zelda games.  There are perhaps a few reasons for this.  First is that players are much more mobile than zombies.  You can dart around their blows extremely easily.  In Zombie canon this may be true in reference to foot speed, where being bitten can be cured by chugging an energy drink.  A single zombie bite spells death, and combat needs to be about avoiding them, not tanking through them.

You can also kill zombies by hitting them anywhere, but you won't lower that by swinging a paddle at the zombie's torso like Dead Island does.  You shouldn't have to have the cursor over the head to do a headshot though (at least not in melee).  Give the player some leeway, there are some allowances that have to be made for the imprecise nature of monitor resolution and mouse accuracy.  Perhaps as your character gets more experience they're better able land head blows.

Supernatural rage abilities turn me off too.

** Its buggy as hell.*

I don't think I need to explain this one much.  Quests that don't work properly

** Weapon construction/repair/uprage system lacks realism

Taking a baseball bat, but I really hope Survivor Zero avoids this type of crap.  Duct taping a flashlight to a gun=cool, re-gripping an axe so you hold onto it better=cool, using a whetstone to sharpen a blade=cool, taping a battery to a machete so it stuns zombies=lame.

Now

First of all

&gt; Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect

I guarantee it'll take you longer than you think

However, and gradually increase the scope of the project as you gain more success. Make prototypes. Evolve them until you know the concepts work. Don't spend too much time focused in on one area. It was mentioned in the original /r/gaming post that someone has already gone out to record sound effects at a gun range. The enthusiasm is great, but let me tell you: you're wasting your time. Sound effects are the last thing you need to be worrying about right now. In fact, you can buy huge sound effect libraries on CD (or probably digitally nowadays) that have professionally recorded sounds done for you. I got one years ago from the library, called Sound Effects 6000 or something, it actually had quite a few well recorded gunshots, both indoors and out. Get major features and functionality done before worrying about stuff like that.

That brings me to another point: *don't make what's already available for free or cheap.* As you may know, but it also costs people's time to make them. If you can pool some money, use it to buy assets. Because trust me, finding good artwork is VERY difficult. Even if you do get good artists, there's no guarantee they'll stick around.

Get a good project management tool. I highly recommend Redmine. It's the most feature complete and flexible free tool I've used

BUY UNITY PRO. For the love of god, the asset library will not sync properly and it will BREAK. The larger your project gets the more of a nightmare it will become. You don't need to pay for the Asset Server (though it might be nice), Subversion is fine. And yeah, it's expensive, but trust me, there's no alternative. You could go use another engine, but none of them are as good. You could write it in XNA, raise money on Kickstarter or something (probably a good idea anyway). I assume, certainly not reliably.

Have a design document. You don't need a massive, and that's fine. Capturing this on a wiki is excellent. If you use a tool like Redmine, you can capture individual features and tasks in the tracker and assign them to people (and link them to the wiki and other cool stuff, Redmine rocks).

Have a unified artistic vision and style, mostly because of existing free and commercial assets that you can leverage. Contrast to say, some cell shaded style where you'd have to do it all from scratch.

That's about all I can think of. I'm not really sure why I felt so motivated to write this up... maybe your project sort of reminds me of my own failed projects

1310693737.0,iq07l,What can you tell us as of now?,lulzwut,56,5,81,"1. Are you aiming for small scale co-op(2-4 players) or larger scale multiplayer?
2. Will the game consist of one large map in which players must explore for resources to survive
3. What exactly will be the point of the game besides surviving
4. What features can you confidently say will be in the game? Will players need to find food and water for instance?

Few suggestions. No particular order and not organized.

1. Players should be able to explore inside of nearly every building/structure
2. Players should be required to find food and water to stay alive.
3. Player inventories should be realistic
4. Cosmetics could be something fun to play with
5. Hunting what little animals are left for food could be another feature.
6. Generators could be another neat feature. Once you build a safe house
7. Vehicle transportation would be cool
8. Players should be able to design all sorts of things using junk they find all over the game world. They could build weapons, and a number of other type of useful items.
9. Weapons(namely melee) should have durability. This way players can't just simply find a weapon such as a baseball bat and use it forever without the need to repair or find a new one.
10. Skills and stats that increase when performing a related action and decrease over time(GAME time) when the player does not practice. An example of this would be by using a melee weapon a lot your strength increases. Start using a gun more often instead and over time your strength will decrease but your ability to use guns will increase. Sprinting often can increase your stamina
11. Players should be able to free-run and learn new techniques to climb and maneuver their way around the map. Some of these abilities should require certain skill levels such as stamina
12. A lot of talk about a ""goal"" has been going on. I think rather than some scripted end game goal
13. Players would need some sort of way to build and/or customize structures like houses. I think something like minecraft would be far too extensive and exploitable though. Perhaps you would be required to start small and build small scale houses
14. Achievement system. Definitely a plus and a nice way to make challenges that players will want to work towards completing.
15. More on inventory. It should not ONLY be about ""slots"", if you go over your weight limit you won't be able to fill up the other slots. How much weight you can carry will be directly in relation to your strength.
16. I was also thinking of rather than having a direct hierarchy of zombies in which one zombie is better all around than another, sprinters are fast, some of them could have been very intelligent before they became zombies and thus retained some of their intelligence when they became zombies, etc. One zombie isn't ""better"" than another; just different. Why make zombies the most simple feature of a game focused on zombies?
17. A little on zombies running. While I don't think they should run, drag or otherwise move faster for short bursts in an attempt to snag the player. This speed shouldn't be as fast as a players default speed however. This would be enough to make being stuck in a small area a little bit more challenging.
18. Death penalty. When you die, which then becomes AI controlled; and you return to the character creation screen to create a new character. When creating a new character, you can choose one of your dead characters and your new character will inherit his/her skills, but NOT inventory. To get your lost inventory, you need to visit the area that your character died, and your inventory will remain there. You do not regain inventory by killing your old character's zombie due to the fact that he may be killed by other players first.
19. While it is said that this will not be an MMO and support a massive amount of players, and letting this be an option that the server creator/host can toggle.
20. Also about hud. I think it should be a very basic minimal hud, but in-game this is impossible and thus would require some other form of knowing your limits. This could be accomplished without a life gauge with the use of in-game effects such as vision blur, loss of balance, etc.

1325285754.0,nwsz1,Project Update: Designing the Apocalypse,s0urc3,55,10,11,"Hey survivors!

Since in our last update I mentioned we were adopting a new sort of development transparency when it comes to how things work around here, I've put together a couple thoughts and decided to throw 'em into an update for you guys to see how we do what we do!

First, and no matter how many assets we provide, there are no and never will be any guarantees that anything in the world of game development is certain. We work day to day, however, and each day we log in, there's always more of something to be done and more to keep in mind, and so far, but we do have a concept of the distance of scope that we're trying to reach and the reality is that it's well within our abilities. The way we've been organizing and tracking our project has worked well for us

To design Survivor Zero, because as we work, we stay logged into our IRC channel and are able to receive pretty much immediate feedback on anything we're working on. Because of this, not only are we able to get more perspective on something that others may not have professional experience in but still have a fresh eye for, but we are also able to avoid the pitfalls of developing something only for it to turn into a complete waste when someone else on the team has a problem with a detail. It's a combination of both agile and classic design standpoints that lends a great flexibility to the development of the project.

We are a group of people with families, but that doesn't stop us from doing what we can to keep this project alive. We've offered the community a chance to weigh in on our crafting processes, thought long and hard about what's fun vs what's simple vs what's possible, and are putting forth a lot of effort into creating a compelling and realistic tension in our gameworld. But we don't want to feel that we're leaving our own lives behind to do so, so do keep in mind the volunteer nature of this project when you consider how long it's taking us. We know you're all excited to play it, and I know I speak for the whole team when I say there is no way in this world that you could possibly as excited as we are to get a chance to see what our work has wrought, so just know we're pressured internally just as much as we are by our fans!

We'd like to thank you all for your support and consideration when it comes to our project, but a perma-link to the individual post will be provided later. Discussion and questions are welcome below, regardless!

You've got the additional NPC firepower standing next to you, who will certainly help try to repel any attack... *but* if that NPC is overcome and infected you've got a real problem. He will go down briefly as he starts to die from the transition, but at some point soon he's going to come up moving fast as the instinctual body panics at what's happening. It would be weak, it would be as likely to attack the other zombies as your own character, but it would introduce even more chaos to the situation for a minute, flailing about

So, I felt two things. First and foremost, a deep-rooted longing for this game to be everything that it could be. Second, that there could perhaps be no better home for the idea of randomly (within sensible constraints) sized, shaped and, as this is zombies we're talking about, disfigured ""creatures"".

Let me make it clear that I'm not a 3D modeller and I'm not a games programmer. I'm an avid games player and have been since the ZX Spectrum ""glory days"" where a small handful of pixels and a healthy imagination could convey almost anything.

I wonder now, high realism graphics, whether this idea is more complex to realise than it may have been a few years ago? Take a simple example: height. Surely not every fireball throwing Doom Imp was a strapping six-footer? Would a bit of sprite-scaling have helped to make things feel more ""real"" (give or take the Martian location, etc.) as we were mobbed by a gang of green-haired ex-marines? Now, the polygon-count is way up and so, perhaps, would be the complexity of scaling the size of my enemies

With Survivor Zero, we'll need large variety to avoid the ""reality""-breaking sense of deja-vu of being overrun by 15 identical, drooling and limping ex-Supermarket employees.

So what parameters might be played with to create such variety?

* Clothing - A change of shirt, trouser or skirt colour/pattern would help to break up the masses.
* Height - As a populace we vary in height enormously and while there may be some pretty solid averages
* Weight - Zombies all move at a pretty glacial pace
* Age - I'm sure I'm not along in thinking it would be fun to put an axe between the eyes of a zombie Granny and what about that difficult moment of having to pull the trigger and scatter the rotting brains of a ten-year-old girl?
* Race - Unless we're in a very sheltered back-water
* Disfigurement - This was the thing that jumped out at me like a lurking zombie from behind a shower-curtain. Randomly missing arms, jaws and bowels are what really separate the living from the (un)dead and just think of the variety options just those few parameters could provide.

I'm sure there are many more

Most weapons (in real life as well as games) have a default attack that people will naturally do when picking one up.  With a kitchen knife, you can hold it by the haft and block/push with it.  With the crowbar you can hook a zombie and pull it to the ground (where it is more easily dispatched).  The kitchen knife is interesting, because unless you're getting lucky and jabbing into the eye, its unlikely you'll be destroying the brain with ""standard"" attacks.  To reliably kill a zombie, you'd want to grab the zombie with an off hand and stab up through the chin or through the eye socket.

What I'm arguing for here is an alternate melee attack in addition to standard swings.  Each weapon would have different alternates.  Some might be push backs or pull downs (such as the crowbar)

An extra suggestion to tack on: Perhaps ""charging up"" an alternate attack could be an interesting mechanic.  Press the alt attack for a blocking weapon, shoving any zombie back.  Hold the alt attack button for a power attack item like a sledge hammer, and you swing it back a bit, then bring it down in a crushing blow.  If you don't hold long enough, you don't get it over your head.

Anyways

* **Click-&gt;block, baseball bat, spear, shovel
* **Click-&gt;block, pick
* **Hold-&gt;power smash**: Sledgehammer
* **Hold-&gt;power decapitate**: two handed swords
* **Click-&gt;grab
* **Hold-&gt;power on**: Chainsaw

As you gain levels/distribute skillpoints/etc your ""wind ups"" take less time, use less stamina, whatever.  Can be as complex or as simple as needed.

Here's an easy way to do this. 

You have an inventory system. Use one item on another

Examples: 

1&gt; Use pile of pistol ammo on (partially) empty pistol magazine

---- Reduce rounds in pile by (pistol_magazine_capacity - pistol_magazine_ammo_count)

---- Set pistol_magazine_ammo_count == pistol_magazine_capacity

2&gt; Use hand* on partially empty pistol magazine  

---- Increase rounds in pile by pistol_magazine_ammo_count

---- Set pistol_magazine_ammo_count == 0 

* I got this idea from the now mostly-defunct mmo [RPWGO](http://www.rpgwo.com/). It had a ""use hand"" command that acted as sort of a ""use in inventory"" button. It was used to activate/deactivate items in your inventory

3&gt; Use scrap cloth on bottle of booze

---- Remove booze

---- Give molotov. 

4&gt; Use toolbox on (broken item)

----Repair item (increase durability)

----Reduce toolbox durability

5&gt; Use hand on medkit/first aid box/pile of bandages/etc. 

---- Heal player

6&gt; Use hammer &amp; nails on wooden bat

---- [Nailbat](http://www.google.com/search?q=nailbat)

7&gt; Use FAK on FAK

---- Combine first aid kits

---- If FAK_durability &gt; 100%

--See: Jagged Alliance 2's system for merging items

8&gt; Use sewing kit on [cloth item]

---- Repair item

9&gt; Use lighter/box of matches/flint block on tinder/fire pit/fire place/BBQ grill

----Light fire. 

This system streamlines crafting and item use

------

When the last news station went off the air two weeks ago a sense of finality settled over him. Just months prior his life had been *normal*, *boring*. Like everyone else he looked towards his future with a longing expectation, hoping something life-changing would happen to him. He didn't necessarily know what that something was, but he expected it to come eventually.

The almost imperceptible static from his radio added a white noise to the dimly lit cellar. He found it the only way he could bring himself to sleep anymore. During his lonely days he would have spent the whole night searching for a signal. Now he felt content to listen to the static and use it to drown out the occasional scream in the distance.

Across the dirt floor he organized the remains of his food stores: a couple cans of green beans, and a chocolate bar he lovingly nibbled on when things were at their worst. Somewhere above him he heard footsteps stumble across the wooden floorboards. He leaned over and twisted the nobs on his radio and light, surrounding himself in a cool darkness. The footsteps were awkward and forced, like the person lacked the coordination to control their own legs. His keen ears told him it was one of them. He waited patiently in the dark.

The footsteps continued for what felt like a solid hour before they moved on. He carefully brought light and sound back into his world and gazed across the remainder of his belongings. He figured the food and water he'd be able to stretch for a week or maybe five days

# (Edit: update 1)


He awoke from his nap and slowly drew back into his daily routine. The hand-crank radio, made it nigh impossible to accurately judge the hour. But hours to him were boiled down to  primal notions. The light, where he could briefly expose himself to the outside world with a low risk of contact, and *feeding time*, where whether it be a stormy sky, or night, *they* were everywhere. He notioned that the coolness had something to do with their increase in activity. He liked to surmise and postulate different theories as to why *they* were here and why world plunged into the dark-ages again, to keep planning. After-all

He turned the crank dial on his light over a few times and gave thanks to the glorious find. Plucked from the hands of a dead girl on Route 32 he didn't give a moments thought to adding it to his supplies. The radio he brought with him all the way from his house appeared in the periphery of his vision. It initially saved him when he heard the tail end of a report that they were spotted in the town next to his. He grabbed a backpack and some food, hunched over the remains of his dog, pulling the sinewy flesh into his mouth by great handfuls. He sprinted until his legs burned and his lungs failed, but he made it.

In his new home, but instead turned out to be a work of fiction written to poke fun at the media personalities dominating the television. How trivial all of those things seemed today. After a little reading, he double checked all of his supplies and categorically placed them into his backpack - all a part of his routine.

The *routine* is what he truly owed his salvation. When all of those around him were losing their heads (quite literally) he'd taken stock in his ability to prepare. Bouncing from town to town he selected the bare essentials from each stop. He listened, a figure which, even when the last human on Earth fell, when the last person was gone, would still remain, because *he* didn't exist. He was nothing. He was zero impact.

With his backpack slung over him, and when his head peered over the edge of his hole, he let his nostrils fill with the familiar smell of blood, new, but not *fresh*. He crawled from the dark and shielded his eyes from the sun. *Today will be a good day*, he thought and strolled out into the field.

(Edit 2)

Crispy August grass crunched under the soles of his running shoes. In the distance

He kept his eyes on the tree-line as he chewed on a long piece of grass. He knew it only took being spotted by one of *them* to bring hundreds more and that could spell disaster if he weren't prepared. The walking did offer a therapeutic release from the claustrophobic existence he now lived. It also heightened his greatest asset – his legs. Oh sure, bat-shit insane adult and get away without a scratch. It's like jumping into a river and not getting wet. So when it comes down to brass tacks, you'd better get your butt in gear and haul ass.

The sun beat down on him and a few wispy clouds reached across the sky. He took a swig from his water jug and hitched it back to his belt. No sooner had he swallowed when he saw a man burst through the tree line. The man kept looking behind him and moments later a group of undead chased out into the field. The man tripped and fell

*Stupid shit, having safely retreated to the trees.

A ways later he crossed over a road. Keeping to the side, so he stashed his pack amongst the trees and carefully crept toward it. His footfalls against the blacktop left a weary feeling in his gut. *You're not supposed to take chances.* But the payoff might be worth the risk.

At the rear of the cop car he found a man propped against the door. The man's face was blistered from extended exposure to the sun. In his lap the man held a black-gripped pistol. 

If the man were still alive

The man's head swung back as Zero steadied the pistol.

“Shoot me...” the man said in a voice just above a whisper.

*Bullets are rare.*

“Please... do it.”

*I might need the shot later on.*

“I'm begging you.”

Zero returned to the woods and retrieved his pack

This is the first time I’ve ever done game networking work

* Non-coders can hopefully understand what’s going on

* There are much more qualified people to write tech documents on networking than I

My cleanup has revolved around our Player object, stats, and other things of that nature.  The real issue was that many early parts of the code were written ‘assuming’ that there would only be one player in any given game.  This was done mostly to get proof of concept code roughed out before polishing and improving on it.

The fix was to remove all of the areas where the player was strictly defined and change it so anything could be assigned to different player objects.  Essentially this came down to assigning an owner to things that needed accessed by a player.  This essentially came down to changing…

    Magazines = GetMagazines(TheWorld.GameState.ThePlayer.PlayerInv);

to

    Magazines = GetMagazines(owner.PlayerInv);

(taken from one of our weapons classes)

After changing issues similar to this

Networking!  While the networking portion specifically is currently not ready for prime time, the server executes those inputs, and finally sends the results to all of the other clients.  Using this method (as opposed to letting the players tell the server what should be happening) helps ensure that a bugged/rogue client can’t send wrong data to all of the other players.

Unity has made networking way easier than it should be.  Their API lets developers spend more time on game code

Client side prediction is giving some trust back to the player who is pressing inputs.  How it should end up working is that when the client does something (say, the server adjusts the player until the needed correction is accounted for.

And this is where our developer’s IRC turned into a discussion about lag compensation for firing shots.  Some concepts were the Source Engine method, and lag/trusting the clients to correctly state whether or not they hit something/implementing all of these and having each method adjustable.

For reference, and jump down a bit if you want to save yourself some reading.

*My big problem with Fallout, you see blown up buildings, burnt out cars strewn across highways. Piles of debris everywhere you go and general disorder.*

*Now obviously you're not going to pick up a hammer yourself and set to work fixing every problem you see. In a game like Fallout, is to craft the game as you see fit, normally through influence and moral based gaming. In Fallout, you can chose to save dozens of individuals, towns, cities and organisations from whatever calamity that is befalling them, through the quest system. At the end of this, give you some money, or flail around on the ground with disease.*

*I say

____________
From this point on

Backstory aside, any location at all. But certain areas of the map are known to be safe, this can be discoverable through conversation with NPC's, writings on walls, following candy on the ground etc. In safe zones (zones can be camps, towns, cities, drilling platforms etc.) you are basically safe from contact with zombies

Through quests, hiring, whatever, you should be able to form yourself from an individual, into a collective/entity/business/organisation/party etc. What you wish to do with your muscle is completely up to you. Wanna purge the town you're currently in and loot what remains, DO IT. Some rival faction over the river giving you strife? It's WARRRR. After you kill their camp, move in and take over. Either rule the new camp, so rather than take over existing buildings and towns and camps

Now, things you think could make this manageable. For instance, you might ask, how the hell would you build an entire town from scratch in a world where you don't even know where your next drink of water is coming from? What I'd LOVE to see, is an economics system similar to that employed in the game Mount and Blade. Rather than you grinding resources yourself, towns/cities/camps etc. trade independently. You may indirectly influence what is traded with whom, but prices, and actual items are simply determined moved around in trading caravans which operate on their own. If you have influence with an existing city, aluminium sheeting etc. gets shipped out to the area. Your workers than fabricate whatever it is you want. The degree of influence you have with cities determines just how much resource they're willing to send out. Small influence = small amount of resources = long construction times = zombies will slowly kill your people are they build shit.

I can keep going on and on and on about how I'd like to see this game

In a nutshell
[img]http://upit.cc/images/1dccf8a2.png[/img]
This is a global map. Dark green = very safe areas. Light green = pretty safe areas. Yellow = Unsafe zombie land. Dark red = motherfucking zombie death traps. White zones are unscouted or just unknown areas.

Taking slow breath in and letting slow breath out, letting the man's last moments replay in his mind. It had been a necessary death. His last exhale finalizing the thought, he stood to examine the woman. He turned her over, her face locked in a grimace of pain and confusion, and closed her eyes. There was no sign of anything but burglary and murder. Hers had been an unnecessary death. Moving her arms to her side, he looked toward the man. Entirely opposite from the woman, yet eerily similar in expression, that Rev was only the implement of destruction. It was a place in the world Rev regretted

Taking a towel from the oven handle

Mac glanced up at the sun, about 1:00. The late summer day had been quite cool, but his head ran warm with anxiety from staring at the bright pink house across the street. The fires at the end of the road had begun to run out of fuel and a few dead had come back his way. Being out of their sight and keeping low, however, he knew Rev still had a little while before they needed to make plans for the night, but it would have to be soon. He tried to will his eyes to see through the thick flower print curtains that draped behind the porch windows, but he knew he would just have to wait.
*****

Dropping one last can of food into his bag, and preserves, they'd appreciate the nutrition later.  He removed a small, ringed, metal cord and a plastic grocery bag and stuffed them into his pants pocket, then cinched the bag tight. Moving back into the room, he solemnly approached the woman's body and knelt. Placing his hands under her knees and back, but among them lay dozens of empty photo frames. Her bed, he saw the people that meant the most and could see that under the frazzled hair, present in nearly all of them. Through varying technologies and resolutions

Allowing the peace to settle for a moment, nodded, and walked back through the room to a small, packed hutch of envelopes and Christmas cards. Kneeling to filter through the scrap-filled trash can, he found several bills unpaid -- simply thrown away -- and encountered more than one ""Final Notice"" creditor envelope before coming upon a recent postmark from upstate on a bright purple ""Happy Birthday!"" envelope - the addressor: ""Troy O'Neill"". He folded the envelope and zipped it away into his bag before walking back to the body of the man to begin his work.
*****

It was a relief to see Rev's face in the window. Rev always told him to practice patience when he could, but when it did, Rev stepped out, carrying a man's body by its wrist and the only foot it had. Its head was crumpled onto its chest and left a trail of blood over the concrete steps. Mac leaned up to see more clearly and could only tell that it had been a while since the man's last shower and that Rev's white shirt clearly showed small flecks of blood while the man was positively covered in it. Looking up to the porch, Rev nodded again, and subtly lifted a hand into the air, quickly rotating it in a ""turn around"" motion. Mac felt his heart rise into his throat and started to turn, steadying himself as Rev nodded, it was then that Mac saw the man's head flop backwards slightly, knowing it was better he learn. Once Rev had made the major cuts

Mac was pale, he felt the sting of regret that he had something to look forward to.",,False,self,t5_2sn4h,1353016549.0,sound,

It was time to go home. Alex had been hanging around downtown Savannah all afternoon, but that was three hours ago. He hadn't responded to any of Alex's phone calls, and now his phone was practically dead. He sat down on a bench and wondered if the sickness scared him from coming.

Alex himself was a wary man. He had a sizable amount of canned goods, and the like at his house for hurricanes or other disasters. When he had heard of the virulent disease blowing through the country he had expected a lot of people to be riled up. As such he had debated whether even coming into Savannah today or not. But it had been so long since he had seen Darren, not since college, and Alex ultimately decided to go. He was coming to regret that.

The streets were a veritable ocean of worried people, it was pretty obvious that it was disease-related. Despite his hatred of the concept of martial law, he ceded that the worries were pretty founded. Media outlets gave startling numbers of deaths, so many that the CDC had blocked coverage of the disease and ordered a blackout on all statistics concerning it, freedom of the press be damned.

The last thing Alex needed was to be stuck in a city under siege by the National Guard from Fort Stewart. He had been here long enough anyway...Darren wasn't coming. Alex put on a dust mask and started making his way through the city blocks. Downtown Savannah, where he could have a straight walk down to the other end of the historic district to where his car was in the parking garage.

The closer he got to the river, no more than three. Alex smiled at the kid before his mother picked him back up and glared at Alex. He heard her tell her child, ""Stay with mommy, we'll be on the boat in just a little while, okay?"" Alex was bewildered. A boat? There were river boats that gave tours, but that didn't attract this many people at this time of day. What did they expect, that they could just get a ride out of the city on some guy's boat docked on River Street?

If that's what this was all about

""The Guard says that they have reports coming in giving an indication that the disease has broken their quarantine. They want to lock down the whole district."" The man slowed

A sense of dread filled him. He was not going to be trapped and put in some FEMA camp with the others. He didn't *need* to go to River Street to make it to the parking garage...the parking garage. That place was going to be congested as hell in just a few minutes. He needed to get there quickly. Taking a right when he reached the next block, he had a decent chance to get out of the city. But his heart quickly sank when he saw what was ahead.

Two humvees blocked the street ahead, and that was if the people at River Street had so thoroughly crowded it that it would be impossible for troops to cut it off. Alex turned back around and made his way to the nearest set of steps that would take him down there. As he neared one, he heard shouts and screams coming from the top of the stairs, and a mob of people pushing all about it. He wondered what was going on. Normally he wouldn't care, but this wasn't a normal day.

As he pushed his way to view the scene, and two crumpled bodies were at the base of the steps. He could see farther down the tide of bodies crammed all the way to the river, glittering in the late afternoon sun. The scene of surprising violence must have been off-putting to many of those people, but Alex's intent to get the hell out of a city that would be on fire by sundown was greater than theirs. Watching his step (not only from the blood-- the two men had broken the old railing on their way down), he kept close to the rough-hewn stone on the right side of the stairs and made his way down to the old brick street. 

Whenever he came down here, slaves, and British sailors. This time was no different. His mind came to the epidemic of Spanish influenza that had plagued the state nearly 100 years ago, and all of the infected that had walked this street. He wondered about all of the infected that would be walking it tonight. Alex adjusted his dust mask and made his way farther on, taking a right, back on his path. Even up here, away from where the boats were docked, and not a boat in sight. ""Good luck with that

But to his dismay, trying to break up the throng of people. Good luck with that. Civilians outnumbered them to a laughable degree here. If Alex kept low, he could just slip by, with hardly anything more than a touch on the shoulder from these troops. He, however, was one of the lucky few that found himself face to mask with one of the growing number of Guard forces.

""Don't go any farther!"" the man said through the mask.

""I haven't heard any news about Savannah being declared in a state of emergency, arguing, and babies crying.

The man's response was grabbing Alex when he tried to shove past. His hands went down to Alex's belt and found the .40 Springfield that Alex kept as a concealed weapon. The soldier hefted his rifle but didn't point it at Alex. ""Hand over the weapon slowly

""You don't have that authority, there would be no way to get to the parking garage. He reached his hand under his jacket, to where the holster was fitted on the inside of his pants.

""Slowly

""Now hand it over and put your hands on your head. The district is under quarantine and we need to get things organized

Then he shoved it under the soldier's chin and pulled the trigger.

The poor guy didn't even have the chance to see it coming. His body immediately dropped to the ground like a ton of bricks. It took a second for the crowd to react to the sound, and the soldiers to Alex's right, where there was now a sizable poised to block off the rest of River Street, were running forward guns readied. They were met by a wall of people whose hysteria must have been broken by the show of resistance and now they were openly combating with their captors. Others, however, moved to grab Alex and bring him to justice.

This entire time he had been staring down at the body. The man he had killed. The one who had just been doing his job. Well, shoving past man and woman alike, barreling over some in the process. He had to leave the scene as quickly as possible. Hopefully in this mess of a situation, they wouldn't recognize who he was. Behind him, he began to hear more gunshots. Then automatic gunfire.

Just a few more strides, in a less crowded part of the city. But that was wishful thinking. People were coming his direction, and not necessarily to get him. There were droves of terrified people trying to get away from the violence that was breaking out all around him. In under an hour, the entire city would be given to roaming militias, and no germ or virus was as scary to Alex as a desperate human being.

He had no idea what this disease did to those it infected. Nobody did, closer to the projects, hungry moans could be heard above the sounds of gunfire and screams.

1351799822.0,12h3al,Stories of Survival: Week 8 - Plateau,Cpt_Steam,23,10,1,"&gt;This is the third installment of Robert's story. Here is Part 1 and Part 2. You can also read this episode on the website [here](http://s-ze.ro/SzPIDn).

Robert came to and solemnly realized that he was not dead.

He pushed himself up off the bedroom floor and licked his dry lips. The sun was already high enough to stop throwing shadows across the room and a staleness hung throughout the house. He drank an entire glass of water from the kitchen before going to the breezeway and locking the front door. He slid the bolt into the frame as noiselessly as he could manage, so he plugged the drain and left while the tub slowly filled up.

He opened the bedroom closet but did not see any of his clothes. Evelyn must've tossed them out or donated them a long time since. There was just an abundance of dresses and shoes; unfamiliar items sprawled across a familiar space. He spent a long time rifling through the closet. What he was looking for had not yet reached the forefront of his mind, it wasn't in the closet, so he returned to the bathroom.

Placing his dirty clothes on the counter, icy waterfall pounded down on him, straight from melted snow. When the tub was full Robert turned off the water, took a deep breath and closed his eyes. He remained still, listening to the sound of the water lapping against the porcelain tub.

He was beside a lake on a quiet summer morning. Low level fog hung inches above the glassy surface, and his mind was wrapped thick in philosophy.

The misty plane that stretched out before him was his future, car payments, and a million other objects of dread. But there was also the lady of the lake, some unknown woman lying in wait, ready to rise out and meet him. He watched as his peers jumped into boats around him and paddled quickly into the future. Robert remained still, watching the way they disrupted the quiet; disrupted the present.

The water in the tub felt warm to him now, Robert felt removed from the world. He was in a place with no ex wife, no dead daughters, no ungodly shamblers.

He was entirely alone.

A startling thought came over Robert, and he would have no way of knowing. He sat up quickly and slammed his forehead against the faucet. Blood seeped down into the bathwater. Stepping out of the bath he grabbed a towel and pushed it against his head. He pulled it back a moment later to examine it and found it drenched with blood. He looked at himself in the mirror; a deep gash ran just above his left eyebrow. He dried off and got dressed, still pressing the towel to the wound.

Back in the bedroom Robert sat on the edge of the bed, their dark wood moulding with a lighter one. Everything around him was as different as it was the same, like looking at the face of a friend after years apart. His eyes came to rest on the laptop left open on the desk. That great unknown he was looking for resurfaced its shapeless head.

Robert plugged the charger into the laptop and let it resume. The laptop had been left on and had powered off automatically. When it was up Robert dragged his finger across the trackpad, sitting in the outbox, waiting for an internet connection, he found it.

**Rob

**I’m not sure if this will send. I’ve tried calling you but the cell towers are overloaded. Everything is going bad. It was on the news for a bit but then that went out also. Ambulances keep going by and people are packing up their cars. I’m going to my mother’s. Not sure it’ll be any better there

**- Evelyn**

The flow of blood had lessened, it would probably get infected. He placed a washcloth against the cut and tied it in place with a teal scarf from the closet. He looked amusingly at his reflection. Dirty clothes, bleary eyes, a bearded face, a feminine scarf.

“Who did you use to be?” Robert asked of his reflection.

His reflection smiled back.

Robert decided he would stay one more night in the house. He’d make sure Evelyn’s laptop was charged

He would keep going until he was dead.

My thinking is thus: if the world is procedurally generated, etc that fit onto standard plots of land.  What is actually in those buildings/etc. also will have to be randomly generated from a library of possible items.  Additionally, you can expect to find different types of zombies in different locations.  Doctor and patient zombies in hospitals, construction worker zombies near construction projects, swat team zombies at police stations, etc.

So with all that in mind, lets do more in the comments.

**Farm Field**

*Items:* Dead crops/edible produce/unripe produce

*Zombies:* Relatively few.  Farmer zombies?

**Police Station**

*Items:* Police radios, guns and ammunition, riot shields/armor

*Zombies:* swat team zombies (in armor)

 It seems to me that the key goal of this game is realism

 **Health** can be conveyed through shaders, and by looking down at your body to survey/fix the damage.

**Exhaustion** can be conveyed through puffing/wheezing/slowing

**Ammo** can be seen by looking at your gun and pulling out the magazine. 

**Compass**/map can be shown by looking at your hands or holding them up next to your gun. 


 I do not see why a game based on realism needs to have any form of HUD whatsoever, looks like shit and you can't walk on it. You don't know that your ""exhaustion meter"" is running low, you just know that you're wincing when you breathe, you're slowing down and you're panting like a bitch. 

 Even **inventory** and **crafting** can be handled in game, you can give it see-through sides to simulate being able to ""feel around"" in it. You can toggle semitransparent cube grid lines to convey an idea of space constraints.  To craft, you hold one item in your left hand, another item in your right, and you use one on the other, no need for any clunky UI pulling you out of the game world. 

 To **exit the game**, if your stronghold is breeched while you're asleep, you die. Perhaps it would be possible to set up an early warning system attached to an rss feed or txt message service in the real world, so you stand a chance of waking up and fending them off. 

For **global chat** we can have voice chat over radios


The way I see it this leaves us with system settings, so that the ease of use is relative to your in game lighting situation.

 Now, many of your actions will need to be mapped to keys, there will need to be hovering text overlays on some things. But all of these can be subtly done. The biggest thing is, with no UI, there will need to be a training level.  

Just think about it for a moment, no retreating to the safety of the inventory screen. Its all you, in the world, all the time. Any thoughts?

Gunpowder can be made with sulfur

Sulfur in the game would be found in chem labs along with other useful items.

Charcoal could be found in small quantities in art stores and in large quantities in ""Costco"" esc. places.  If necessary it could be made from scratch.

Saltpeter can be made from guano in caves or manure from cow farms

A few hours after the sun had risen, almost jogging toward the construction site that sprawled out into the dirt field.

Brooke pushed open the chain link gate at the perimeter of the site, locked the door behind her, and, after quickly wiping the seat, dropped her pants and sat down. She had still not quite gotten used to this whole “apocalypse” thing.

Danny had been awake for a few hours now

“Hi baby!” She exclaimed as she held her son, so Danny would be filling the diaper any minute now. “That’s okay my little man, you take your time.” Danny began to quietly babble, slipping in a toothless grin here and there as he conversed with his mother.

“Yeah, did we Dan?” Brooke wiped and stood up, remembering the last time she’d been in a port-a-potty. “He just blocked the door, like we wouldn’t know it was him.” She paused for a second, smiling, thinking of Anthony leaning against the thin plastic door. Finally turning to leave, Brooke tried to push the door as it resisted. She pushed harder, switching the sign to “occupied” once again.

“Well that’s just fucking great, kicking herself for not following procedure. As the man battered the door and howled in the deserted construction site, Brooke sized up her sarcophagus for an exit strategy. Having been in a similar situation once before, she knew there was no way out. Her only hope was through that monster at the door.

“Alright Danny, wrapping up his arms in her jacket. “I’ll be back in just a second.” As soon as she turned towards the door, the wail started up from behind her as Danny screamed for his mother’s arms. The man at the door grew more forceful and another pair of hands smacked against the side, silhouetted against the wall. She knew it would be a close call, but she had to try. As she unlatched the door, another pair of hands pawed at the walls. Then another. And another.

Her stomach dropped as she locked the door again and slumped against it, head in her hands, trying to think of a way out. The monsters outside grew more and more restless with each passing second as Danny’s shriek grew more intense. “Just shut the fuck up!” She stood up and scooped her son out of the sink, wrapping him tightly in her arms as she dropped back to the floor. She rose her voice as a melody escaped her lips. “Hush little baby, don’t you cry, or mommy’s gonna toss you out to die. And if you make her do that, well

Buckshot ripped through the plastic siding of the port-a-potty, silencing him. She listened as the varied gunshots sporadically echoed through the construction site. As the last shot rang out, the deafening silence filled her ears. Brooke arched her back and looked at Danny, his eyes red and shaking with fright as she grabbed him and sat up. A moment later, a light rapping on the door made her jump.

“Anybody in there?” Brooke remained silent

A mousy voice commented

After a deep sigh, Jesus Christ!” Brooke watched helplessly as a metal bar slid into the structure between the frame and the door, snapping it open as the bright light rushed inside. She covered her eyes and pulled Danny close as a hand reached out to her. “It’s okay,” the man reassured her. “You’re safe now.”",,False,self,1352523111.0,t3_12x1ov

The most serious threat is the other living humans.

Characters often must cooperate with others to survive

Then there are the straight up villains - racist cops going on a shooting spree, corrupt wannabe tyrants, and so on. There could be slave traders, terrorists using the chaos as a chance to set off a nuke, and so on. (Speaking of which - what about nuclear power plant meltdowns... how long would it take after abandonment before they all start going Fukushima/Chernobyl, but without *any* mitigation?)

And of course most of the dramatic tension in many of these stories comes from the effort to protect dependents - Ben trying to help the catatonic Barbra in the original *Night of the Living Dead, falling in love, and so on. You could start out with one or more dependents, or pick them up along the way. You could recruit followers, who you would then also need to protect but might be a bit less helpless and more useful than dependents.

It might facilitate gameplay to have occasional wandering traders (as in *Fallout 3)* or trading posts. These could be simple and straightforward

There could be factions that you could join, rob, temporarily ally with, and so on, similar to the groups in *The Walking Dead:* The Governor's town, the prisoners, the families in the camp outside Atlanta, and so on.

With sufficient complexity, and so on. You could take leadership roles within groups, betray them, and so on. That level of politics, especially involving game AI, may be more ambitious than your plan, but it would be awesome.

Physical activities like running and swimming should increase the player's stamina over time, which uses stamina, this could be a hidden attribute. Imagine jumping from roof top to roof top in a city, some jumps are easier to make, while others are harder. 

Calorie intakes should also have temperately and long term affect on your base physical attributes, stamina at 10-20%, has a chance to blackout, etc. And the person should also lose weight. On the flip side a player can gain weight, fat in this case, if a player has a calorie surplus and not getting enough physical activities. Gaining muscle is also possible with the combination of right calorie intake and physical activities. 

I think this could be implemented easily if the team taken action early in the development stage. Every food item has a defined amount of calories. If not enough maintenance calories (varies with player's weight) are consumed then their will be an effect on the player. I can provide you with a formula of calories macro if interested.

Sorry if you guys have made this clear already, just loners like you who you can encounter and interact with occasionally. Even Terraria has a few NPC's.

Also your FAQ suggests that you can build things in the game, I'd assume that if you're in a city infested with zombies, you wouldn't try to build sandcastles, especially if you're by yourself. IRL, your only goals would be to survive (eating, drinking, defense against zombies) and finding other survivors. And just trying to survive can get a little tedious after a while if the player doesn't have a clear direction. Realistically

Your realistic approach obviously wouldn't favor a guns blazing style of play. The game sounds like it will be like I Am Legend, the game will lose its charm after a while, when you learn how to survive easily, and you customize your character more and more.

Also, furniture stores, supermarkets, hardware stores, pharmacies (and water fountains, residential apartments/houses with limited supplies). Integrating them into the experience will make the game even more fun than it sounds, and it would provide a very realistic way to give the player the resources they need instead of dropping them on the sidewalk.

All items have two parameters: weight and bulk.

You have equipment slots (weapon, shoes, backpack, belt, etc). 

Double-clicking a container opens it. The standardized Windows interface gives every container box its own close button.

Containers (belts, chests) have two capacities: weight and bulk. As per basic logic, items can be placed into containers until their weight and/or bulk capacity would be over-filled. 

""It's too heavy for your small pack."" 
""It's too bulky for your large bag."" 

For equipment slots, a bashing/cutting item for your weapon slot*, you get the idea. 

*thought this could be two or three slots, and a longarm. An alternate would be a large weapon/item and a small weapon/item, such as a claw hammer and a rifle, or a pistol and a sword/fire axe.

1310972016.0,ism9h,Applying for the UI/HUD Designer position,jimmysaint13,8,6,7,"Hello! I'm going to be applying for the UI/HUD designer spot and I'd just like to show you guys some things that I'm working on/ideas that I'm pitching.

**Character Status**
First off, Thirst, and Fatigue. A minimal HUD will have none of these things, while you'll have the option for a full HUD which includes indicators for all four things. If you choose to have no HUD, you will have to rely on audio/visual cues.

For low health

For hunger, you've just starved to death.

Severe fatigue will result in your character moving slowly, you will pass out on the spot for several (to be decided how many) hours. When you wake, you will still be severely fatigued, so it would be a VERY good idea to get somewhere safe and get some sleep!

For thirst... I've really tried to think of something for this. What kind of audio cue would you have for this? Seriously

**Inventory Management**
This idea I'm really excited about. The idea is to have a Resident Evil or Diablo-style 'square slot' system. Different items take up different numbers of boxes in different configurations depending on their size. For example, a chainsaw taking up a 2x4 box section and so on. Now for the part I'm excited about: 3 distinct 'bag types'. The types I've come up with are [Messenger Bag,](http://i.imgur.com/XtUhq.png) [Backpack,](http://i.imgur.com/Bq2f4.png) and [Mil-Spec Duffle.](http://i.imgur.com/ixekq.png) The Messenger Bag holds the least, but also hinders your movement the least. The Duffle will hold lots, but can easily get cumbersome. The Backpack is equivalent to a medium-sized school backpack and is a compromise between the two.

**Ammo Management**
Another idea that I'm proud of is the idea of using an [Ammo Pouch](http://i.imgur.com/ya1Rg.png). Long story short, but it will take longer to reload.

**Cell Phone UI**
I wanted to design an interface that minimized immersion breaking. The idea came to me about using a Cell phone during a conversation with a friend that cell phone usage has become so widespread, I figured a Cell Phone UI would be the best choice for realism and immersion. A more detailed explanation is available in [this image](http://i.imgur.com/ZjHlc.png) with more refined ""Home Screen"" images [here](http://i.imgur.com/FK261.png), [here](http://i.imgur.com/6510H.png), and [here](http://i.imgur.com/osT6w.png).

**Minimal HUD**
Now, and Full HUD. I don't have an image for a Full HUD made up yet, but here is my idea for a [Minimal HUD](http://i.imgur.com/xQmtL.jpg). Basically all you have there are small icon reminders of what to press to bring up other things. Not shown is weapon info, which is only the name of the weapon you will use. This will only show up when switching to that new weapon and will disappear after a few seconds.

I am currently working on a mockup for a Full HUD

Duration of the game: 
What happens if you kill them all
What if whenever you died there would be a ai zombie version of you walking around?


Weapons:
as I said in another post weapons could be improvised, bat, etc.
Obviously having hardware and gun stores would be available.
NO DEAD RISING COMBO WEAPONS. If anything make them plausible. 

Zombies:
What caused the outbreak? Virus zombies? already dead
Something got into the water therefor infecting the soil?
Their health could be gaged by what kind they are

Animals:
Are they immune?

Multiplayer:
I do like the idea of classes, etc.
Would have to have a limit of them as their can be so many

Health:
realistically it would be almost impossible to heal unless you had some sort of antidote. Unless we vote to make it so legit you get bit and you will die/turn. In that case when bit or scratched or whatever will affect how your health degenerates

Death:
Respawn? In a sandbox game that would be best.

Plot/Missions:
Sandbox games can be boring if there are no side missions. Easy

Setting:
City? city with suburbs? Or a mix. 
I would like to see some kind of fortress customization.
example: As you walk around you see a building/house

One thing I find lacking in many zombie games is the ""Dead people becoming zombies"" factor.  As in

While the L4D type of ""start the game with a million zombies"" is fun

As in, the infection spreads exponentially.  THAT's what I want to see in a zombie game.  I want to see the infection happening.


But how can you have so many players

Easy!  Make them NPC's!  Start in an suburban environment (say

Then you see a sick person (obviously a zombie) ambling along

And you (and whoever you're playing with) are the only ones armed with a gun, and there will be no more source of zombies (they're all dead), so you WIN!  However, this will almost never happen, as the infection always spreads very quickly (exponentially, of course).

So not only are you playing to save yourself

Please tell me this makes sense.


EDIT:

Oh my god I just had the BEST idea!


Ok


Buuuut let's say you can't FIND the zombie!  Say the map is enormous (borderline open-world, but not open world).  You need to search while you can for the initial zombies!  Say it takes 1 minute for a killed person to become a zombie.  And it takes time for the slow, dumb zombie to actually kill someone.  And now let's say the zombie spawns randomly.  Could spawn at your feet in the beginning of the game.  Or it could spawn on the other side of the map.  There's no way of knowing.


What you DO know is the amount of current zombies.  At the top right of the screen, and maybe you don't see signs of a zombie apocalypse immediately...maybe it's happening too far away...but you know you're running out of time and you have to find the outbreak and isolate it FAST....or there'll be no way of winning...

Oh my god I'm getting such nerd chills right now

EDIT 2: I can't stop here

So the game starts and you know one thing: there's a zombie somewhere out there threatening this world, I guess!) go their own ways and get in THEIR own cars (or walk; maybe one section of the map is offroad or bad for driving) and hunt down the initial infection zone so you can find it and stop it before it spreads too much to stop.  You take the main street of the town (old school 60's downtown area).  A friend checks the housing roads.  Another friend takes a grocery store area.  You're all searching.  The number of infected at the top of your screen just rose to 3, but none of you see anything yet.


Suddenly, drive like a lunatic and run them all down! anyway, as I was saying, you drive down the block) and see two zombies slowly ambling after an old lady.  You call out to your teammates your location.  It pings on their maps, and they come as quickly as possible.  You take out the two zombies...but that still leaves one more.  The infected-counter pings up to 2 again, then 4, and suddenly you're in more trouble.  You isolated some of the incident, and is spreading the infection once again.  You were so close!  This time you don't find the outbreak until there are 30 zombies, to the grocery store

OH MY GOD

There could be a small-town USA map (like I was describing above), oh man....I don't know if I'm the only one who loves this idea.  Not sure if others will care for it like I do, but THIS is what I want in a zombie game.

Let's hypothetically say, lay down the law. 

From this day forward I would institute a a full disclosure policy. We would maintain an actual, consistent manner. This person would also be the one to reach out to game journalism sites and help spread a positive view of the company. 

We would do away with inconsistent statements. Percentages that simply couldn't exist and promises unless absolutely sure we could keep them.

I would immediately hire professional moderators. They would maintain consistent quality control over the forums. I would do away with volunteer moderators as in my experience

I would not be so heavy handed with the rules governing community discussions. Even negative criticism has it's place. The only aspects we would act upon would be discussions and comments of an OFFENSIVE nature.

I would schedule a meeting with all staff members

I would look for an outside anti-hacker program. Bring in professional's who have experience with anti-hacker programs and abandon the in house program so the existing programmers can focus on optimizing the game. 

Speaking of the game. 

I would strive in the early days to BALANCE the game. I would test number of players VS number of Zombies for both difficulty

GC would be for COSMETIC changes only

I would stop adding weapons, items, anything to do with GC until the core PROMISED inclusions were complete.

I suggest looking at windfarms as being a place where people would go at least to hook up for power. I think a solar grid could work but in all likelihood zombies are going to smash solar power grids for fun.

Fuel operated generators are going to be pretty bad since they put off such a large amount of noise pollution. Basically I would cause them to increase aggro radius of any camp by a couple miles unless they were deep underground or in a noiseproof room.

Players are going to need to nest in to survive for one night. In any zombie movie I've seen the only players able to survive were able to nest effectively by either being high up off the ground or inside impenetrable fortresses.

Typically anything public access today like shopping malls or whatnot are not going to be suitable since they are constructed with poor material.

Military bases would work but I'm not sure what condition you would make them in or if they would be crawling or not.

I think players should be able to change the physical aspects of rooms they want to use for shelters by reinforcing the rooms.

I recommend putting up a menu UI for this so that each room prefab you make will have multiple levels of security based on the skill of the player.

Some options would be for noiseproofing

___________________________________________________________________    
    
Let's look at this comment posted by **mriodine**:

&gt; personally, and any actions should be up to the players--you should be able to shoot whoever the F**k you want, adn the only effect of identifying with a faction is that you'd be identified with them properly, so that they would actually let you into their fort.
  
  
I really like the idea of this. Having a whole shit-ton of zombies to worry about as well as human interaction adds realism as well as massivemassivemassive playability to the game. Being able to make friends and enemies and having to watch your back for zombies at the same time kind of reminds me of a Fallout: New Vegas type experience only with real players instead of AI.

               ____________________________________________
    
    
Of course

&gt; I agree, and any small groups would just be pushed into the corner and be pocked at with a stick. Also with huge factions, it will become more of a player vs player game and the zombie are just some minor enemies. I think the factions is a good idea so long as its controlled
___________________________________________________________________    
    
    
This is an extremely crucial thought to this type of playing experience. As with most games that encourage free-world multiplayer interaction, faction - will be a huge problem for any other player who decides they don't want to group with this faction. Here's a small list of possible problems with this idea:

* Head faction(s) will take ultimate control

* Too many factions will take away from zombie aspects

* New players might be drawn away from game due to head faction(s)

* Smaller factions will be kept down

* It will become more of a ""survive against humans"" than ""survive against zombies"" game
    
    
It's true. There's always the threat of early players starting factions that just grow and grow causing people who join later in the game to be turned off or making their experience less exciting by just jumping into a faction with immediate protection or having to watch out for other human players killing them immediately with no repercussions. The game might also turn into being about surviving against these larger factions and zombies being a smaller issue.

    
    
I've thought of some ways to possibly combat some of these issues.

* A possible way to combat the issue is just having different regions players can join. The regions would be like different cities and each city would only allow a certain amount of playable characters to join. I'm thinking kind of like how Runescape (lame

* Limit how many people can be in a faction. This way more factions might be created but it might turn into more of a worldly order kind of like the United Nations with all the different factions acting like countries in today's world. Of course
    
    
I honestly have no idea if this post is going to be a useful contribution or if any of these ideas are even possible but I'd still love to see some discussion on this. I think the idea of having human players pose as a threat as well as zombies really adds to the realism of the game and would more than likely have me hooked on the game.

1311828672.0,j1vs2,a possible game mechanic.,daoudalqasir,2,2,5," i would really like this game to have a minecrafty element with possibility to build amazing structures out of resources you find in the game, and all that piping you were going to irrigate with maybe it would be better used to build a rocket launcher our maybe the barrel of a home made sniper rifle or cut in half an you have enough for the barrels for two pistols. the possibilities are endless!

so i started rambling a bit there but what do you guys think of that idea also i love the idea of being able to build an empire or corporation and expand your territory of control.

edit: ok i just cant stop throwing out ideas here: also digging buy/build a shovel now you can dig out the space to build you self a bunker, you'll have to find away to fuse it into more use full shapes. and a saw can be used to cut the environment in to the exact shape you want all though more time consuming than just smashing a hole in the wall, will be key to extracting the resources in the way you want or for creating elaborate traps for zombies, also necessary for building homemade weapons cut that piping to the exact length you want to adjust the accuracy and range of the gun your building, and the barrel is just one part of it. each aspect and feature can be sculpted to make an entirely unique weapon both stat wise and visual wise. ok next item electrical wiring (i get it redstone, i know this is starting to sound more and more like minecraft, just bear with me a bit) once you build you bunker how are you gonna get the lights on down there your gonna have to connect itn to some sort of power source using that wiring maybe you can connect to a still functioning part of the grid (but its been years since that things been kept up half of its broken its leaking power all over place it will only provide you with a limited amount of power) or maybe you found and old power plant you can connect to near your base or maybe it was a bit farther away

then theres also a welding torch for connecting to bits of metal and nails for wood. glue too but that wears down easily.

reserves of gasoline or bateries can be found or bought through out the wastes to power the different devices you build

vehicles such as cars

so heres the breakdown. the world is entire destructible based on a certain amount of damage some thing takes. every time you touch something it does a little bit of damage (zombies do a whole lot more) this amount of damage on most objects is so miniscule that it would take hundreds maybe thousands of touches to break it. devices such as hammers will do exponentially more damage than you will with your hands also the damage you do will be localized to a certain point in a wall if you use a hammer than according to the amount of damage it does that exceeds the walls limit the physics engine will judge how large an area of the wall was destroyed (i.e if you decide to spend an hour tapping at a wall until you reach exactly its damage limit then you will only end up punching a small hole in it

saws will be for much more detailed jobs

digging will work like a mix of the two both the material (type of dirt) and damage value will dictate how deep and wide you dig. though dirt will over time even out so the walls of you hole/ tunnel must be quickly reinforced with another material so it doesn't collapse.

every different component of an item will break down independently

alright last point. NO MATERIAL IS INDESTRUCTIBLE! this keeps the game a zombie survival game at its heart rather than just a creative sandbox thing. remember i mentioned that zombies do a lot more touch damage to objects than you do

ok i know it sounds allot like minecraft so let me try to point out how it could be different and how it won't just end up as a creative game.

1. zombies! the whole game is based around zombies

2. chances are you wont be able to make a pretty base

3. building your own weapons. building you own 100% unique guns and melee weapons with almost infinite possibility is way cooler than building a house and your going to want to use those weapons.

4. you not breaking a cube and getting a cube

5. this is just one aspect of the game

so i'm sure this is an incredible unrealistic idea but still how amazing would this be? i'm just wondering you guys thoughts are?

sorry for the wall of text and bad grammar i apologize.

1313537822.0,jl09m,Few idea's for the game ~,Daleee,2,3,2,"Hey

Randomly chosen weather like rain

I was thinking for when it rains, also when its raining you shouldnt be able to run as fast, as the floor becomes slippery, so if you sprint or whatever you either have a chance to fall over, or you just have a speed reduction during rain.

As for fog, but as its fog running speed isnt impaired.

Also i was thiking if during rain

Also another idea i had, and you reload without the clip being empty then you lose the ammo in the clip but your weight decreases as you drop the clip (if a weight system is added) Or your could choose a setting where no clips are dropped and they are just added to the backpack weather theyre empty or not. Also no idication of the ammount of ammo left would be a good idea, forcing people to stop in a safe place and manually count their ammo? (Possilby by unloading the bullets from each clip and counting manually requiring a minute or so of being stood still while an animation plays as you look at your weapon unload ect)

There would be legal problems with actually playing real music, we could have redditors compose music for the game.

Other things: The DJs would roleplay. This makes sense because we want the game to be immersive. There's a problem with this, we could just record each hour and, should a radio spot be vacant, we could just use recordings that occur each day. (Example, 7-9 PM EST happens to be empty and we can't get a filler, we could use the recordings from 1-3 PM of the same day)

Will zombies be able to use weapons?

Were you thinking of having animals too? (might be cool to see zombie elephants coming out of a zoo! haha)

Were you planning on having the player spawn with a weapon and armor or will this be like an ""average Joe"" who grabs his trusty 
baseball bat?

Were you going to add human npc's or are you the only survivor?

Will there be weapon condition?
If there will be weapon condition

Will weapons have add-on's / upgrades / different ammo types?

If you die

Will weapons respawn at their original spots

Will you have a limited inventory

If yes, pouches, fitness levels?

Is there going to be a leveling system? 

Is there going to be a skill system? like in the original deus ex for example?

If the answer to either of these questions is yes

Are you going for a comedic game or a more intense

It would be really cool to have a system by which zombies ""breed"" and new variations of zombies come about automatically. If a zombie with a higher than average movement speed bred with another zombie that is capable of opening doors, such as climbing over various obstacles, you'd have an even more deadly and fearsome zombie.

This would allow for the universe to grow with the player. All the zombies could start out as very basic zombies with very small variations in their capabilities. As you fight the zombies, creating more and more variations. Some far more deadly, some far LESS deadly (mmm cannon fodder). So now, as the player becomes more capable of survival, amasses more weapons and learns his surroundings better, the game continually presents new challenges as the zombies are getting ""better"" also.

Perhaps, the zombie version of that human player would inherit some portion of the traits that were present prior to turning. Perhaps he was exceptionally strong, or fast.
