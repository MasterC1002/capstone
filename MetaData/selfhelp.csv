A time comes in your life when you finally, like a child quieting down after a tantrum, you blink back your tears and begin to look at the world through new eyes.

This is your awakening.

You realize it’s time to stop hoping and waiting for something to change
You realize that in the real world there aren’t always fairy tale endings
You awaken to the fact that you are not perfect and that not everyone will always love
You learn the importance of loving and championing yourself…and in the process a sense of new found confidence is born of self-approval.
Your stop complaining and blaming other people for the things they did to you – or didn’t do for you – and you learn that the only thing you can really count on is the unexpected.
You learn that people don’t always say what they mean or mean what they say and that not everyone will always be there for you and everything isn’t always about you.
So
You stop judging and pointing fingers and you begin to accept people as they are and to overlook their shortcomings and human frailties…and in the process a sense of peace and contentment is born of forgiveness.
You learn to open up to new worlds and different points of view. You begin reassessing and redefining who you are and what you really stand for.
You learn the difference between wanting and needing and you begin to discard the doctrines and values you’ve outgrown
You learn that there is power and glory in creating and contributing and you stop maneuvering through life merely as a “consumer” looking for you next fix.
You learn that principles such as honesty and integrity are not the outdated ideals of a bygone era
You learn that you don’t know everything
Then you learn about love. You learn to look at relationships as they really are and not as you would have them be. You learn that alone does not mean lonely.
You stop trying to control people
You also stop working so hard at putting your feelings aside
You learn that your body really is your temple. You begin to care for it and treat it with respect. You begin to eat a balanced diet
You learn that being tired fuels doubt, just food fuels the body, laughter fuels our soul. So you take more time to laugh and to play.
You learn that, and that much of life truly is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
You learn that anything worth achieving is worth working for and that wishing for something to happen is different than working toward making it happen.
More importantly, and that it’s OK to risk asking for help.
You learn the only thing you must truly fear is fear itself. You learn to step right into and through your fears because you know that whatever happens you can handle it and to give in to fear is to give away the right to live life on your own terms.
You learn to fight for your life and not to squander it living under a cloud of impending doom.
You learn that life isn’t always fair
You learn that nobody’s punishing you and everything isn’t always somebody’s fault. It’s just life happening. You learn to admit when you are wrong and to build bridges instead of walls.
You lean that negative feelings such as anger
You learn to be thankful and to take comfort in many of the simple things we take for granted, a soft warm bed, a long hot shower.
Then
You make it a point to keep smiling
You hang a wind chime outside your window so you can listen to the wind.
Finally, you take a deep breath, and you begin to design the life you want to live as best as you can.

You don’t need to even like or love the task or what you are doing.
Emotions comes &amp; go isn’t a steady state &amp; if we all depend in our emotion &amp; passionate state to work well the world would be doomed long time age.
All comes to the rational mind; you need to use the rational mind to control your emotion
* First: don’t let the task define your worth or happiness &amp; don’t try to be perfect Make a guarantee to yourself: ""Whatever happens, the anxiety that leads to procrastination will also go away.
* Second: Don’t make yourself a victim &amp; feel you are forced &amp; have to do the task 
* You are in control “Choose” to do the task that will give you sense that you are in control 
* You don't have to _want_ to do things
* And when you find yourself losing motivation
* Third: Break the Project Down &amp; don’t compare performance to the final outcome 
* Fourth: THE SECERT OF MOTIVATION 
Distant and indefinite rewards do not produce much motivation -- rewards must be more immediate and definite. ""In other words

This where all Guru Fail at They all want you to focus in the final outcome While actually psychologist say we must focus on the process because normally people will compare where they are with the final outcome which seem distant &amp; hard to get and to make it worse they make you visualize (Gurus) about the things that you will have if you achieve the outcome &amp; when you fail to follow through the process you will feel worse

He is always in a good mood and always has something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, I would be twins!"" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant.

The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day

Seeing this style really made me curious, ""Each morning I wake up and say to myself, Jerry, you have two choices today. You can choose to be in a good mood or you can choose to be in a bad mood.

I choose to be in a good mood. Each time something bad happens

""Yeah,"" I protested. ""Yes, it is,"" Jerry said. ""Life is all about choices. When you cut away all the junk, every situation is a choice. You choose how you react to situations. You choose how people will affect your mood. You choose to be in a good mood or bad mood. The bottom line: It's your choice how you live life.""

I reflected on what Jerry said. Soon thereafter

Several years later, shaking from nervousness, slipped off the combination. The robbers panicked and shot him. Luckily, Jerry was found relatively quickly and rushed to the local trauma center. After 18 hours of surgery and weeks of intensive care, Jerry was released from the hospital with fragments of the bullets still in his body.

I saw Jerry about six months after the accident. When I asked him how he was, I'd be twins. Wanna see my scars?"" I declined to see his wounds, but did ask him what had gone through his mind as the robbery took place. “The first thing that went through my mind was that I should have locked the back door,"" Jerry replied. ""Then, as I lay on the floor, I remembered that I had two choices: I could choose to live or I could choose to die. I chose to live.""
""Weren't you scared? Did you lose consciousness?"" I asked. Jerry continued, I read ""he's a dead man.""

I knew I needed to take action."" "" What did you do?"" I asked. ""Well,' I replied. The doctors and nurses stopped working as they waited for my reply. I took a deep breath and yelled, 'Bullets!' Over their laughter, I told them, 'I am choosing to live. Operate on me as if I am alive, not dead.'""

Jerry lived thanks to the skill of his doctors, is everything.

So
A little bit of background info: I am a  15 year old female

When I was 13 (I think), and couldn't think straight for the next week. We had a very healthy relationship, our family is very close-knit and happy. My brother and I were also very close and it absolutely disgusted and horrified me that he could maintain that facade in front of me and do such unspeakable things behind my back. 
I became aware that he regularly tried to look through my bathroom window. Of course after I found out, etc.
Around the same time, and heavy breathing. His hand was on the small of my back, barely touching, but still there. I instantly moved, made it seem like I moved in my sleep. He backed off for a while, and when he again started to move towards me, I pretended to wake up and go outside. I never slept in his bed after that. 
The shower watching thing went on for a year and a half. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't tell my parents
My mind knew I had to do something
He did

Fast forward to a month back. I thought it was over
We were at my grandma's place, what else do I see but the top of my brother's trying to peek into the stall. I went into the other room as fast as I could, and I'm pretty sure he didn't see anything. 
But it caused all the insecurities, to well up in me again. 
Now, and I love him a lot too. It's not the hormonal teenage love either. I had thought about sharing this with him, but I could never bring myself to it. He was sexually assaulted as a child, and he has shared it with me, and I'm helping him work through his problems. But I still cannot tell him. 
Anyway, to recover some lost photographs, my brother is running a photo recovery software on my computer. He has to look through 80000 pictures. He will see those pictures of me, and they will be near the top. That scares the fuck out of me. I can't imagine him looking at them, and possibly, fapping (cringe) to them. I don't know what to do. I can't let this continue. 
I have done nothing but be kind to people my entire life. My existence is based purely on making others happy. What have I done to deserve a fucking pedophilic incestuous son of a bitch for a brother? 
I hate him. But inspite of all this, I do love him. He's my brother.

It's extremely simple and we sometimes use it without realizing it.

Quote:
**“Within every problem you can't solve

Find a problem, you can begin to work your way up to a solution.

Example Problem: I can't afford my current living situation.

Why?

1. New problem: My bills are too damn high!

	A. Breakdown: My rent is too high.

		Can you move to a smaller place?

		Can you rent out a room?

		Get more income (Go to #2)


	B. Breakdown: My utilities are too high.

		Can you cut back on usage? (Electric, etc...)

		Can you cut back/reduce any bills? (eg. Netflix, Cell Phone)

		Get more income (Go to #2)

	C. Breakdown: My dept bills are too high (see #3)



2. New problem: I feel that I am underpaid.

	A. Breakdown: My job pays too little.

		Are you due for a raise?

		Are you underpaid for your industry?

		Can you find a better position or improve your skills?

	B. Breakdown: I need a second job or more hours.

		Can you find another part time job?

		Can you start a side business to earn some extra money?

		Are you already overworked? Find a different job.
	


3. New problem: I have too much dept.

	A. My dept bills are too high.

		Have you considered consolidation services?

		Have you tried to get a loan in order to self-consolidate?

		Have you considered bankruptcy?

	B. My student loans are too high!

		Have you thought about forbearance or deferment options?

		Can you go back to school part time in order to defer payment?

		Have you looked in to loan forgiveness plans?

	C. I can't afford my dept payments.

		You may be underpaid or need to cut other costs. See #1 or #2




This is a brief example, we will have to find one that we actually have control over. 


Example: 

I can't afford my current living situation...

→ Because my job pays too little

→ → Because I am underpaid for my industry

→ → → Solution: So I will brush up on my skills and apply at another company.


My car is broken...

→ Because it wont start

→ → Because I turn the key and nothing happens.

→ → → According to research

→ → → → Jump start didn't work. Battery may not be holding a charge.

→ → → → → So I tried a different battery and now it starts. Solution: Needed a new battery.",,t5_2qho7,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1hvo06/a_problem_solving_strategy_that_has_helped_me_for/

1362587467.0,19s5u2,I'm on the verge of insanity so I wrote a little bit to clear my thoughts. ,s1wg4u,27,2,7,"I’ve never been good with words. Not when it comes to speaking them at least. I’ve spent my entire life keeping everyone at an arm’s length. Not because I don’t want to know people

It all goes back to my youth. 

What they don’t teach you in elementary school is the important things. They don't teach you how to communicate, video games, books, movies, God… the list goes on and on.

I wish I could count the hours I’ve wasted away doing absolutely nothing of substance. But I would argue it’s not entirely my fault.

I’m fundamentally broken because the system is fundamentally broken.
Why is it that in this day and age we don’t teach children what’s actually important in life? As school children, or science. But why is that more important than being taught how to love, how to live, how to communicate, or how to mourn?

Doctors and Scientists spend their entire careers wondering why so many people take their own life. They chalk it up to ‘abnormal brain chemistry’ or ‘genetics.’ But I know that’s not the truth.

The truth is our wasted youth.

You see, we go to school, we learn algebra or biology or some other useless bullshit, we get taught what to think, we get taught who to be, and then we go home.

We’re never taught how to be ourselves. We aren't taught how to think for ourselves. And we’re certainly never taught essential life skills like communicating, coping mechanisms, or happiness.

And I ask

How is algebra more important than LEARNING how to live? How is learning the layout of a simple cell MORE IMPORTANT than learning how to be emotionally happy and fulfilled?

Some might say

And I would say in response

Seriously

Do you know how many people I’ve ever seen actually live life like that and be happy?  One. And I can easily imagine it's the same for most people.

Can you honestly say that you’re happy? No

I know I can’t
There’s nothing fulfilling about slaving your life away in some meaningless job doing something you don’t love. But yet… that’s what we’re taught to do. That’s how we’re told it’s supposed to be.

But that’s not how it’s supposed to be
Our cold war era education system is outdated. If it was a guitar

Don’t get me wrong… math, laugh, and love. 

I would even argue that it’s more important to teach kids how to do those things… how can basic science or math be more important than learning basic principles to live by?
How can a geometrical shape be more important than knowing how to live? Why aren’t we taught the skills necessary to be happy? Why aren’t we taught how to harness life to its full potential?  

And I mean truly harness it and live it for what it’s worth. Not just be ‘content.’

The fact is

They should encourage you and plant seeds that help you find who you really are.

They should teach kids lifelong habits, coping mechanisms, how to live, laugh, love,  and more.

It shouldn’t just be about the numbers and facts.

It should be about living life itself.

Do you want to know why so many people want to kill themselves?

I would imagine it's because they don’t know how to live.

And it’s not their fault. We’re just a factor of the society that created us. Sure

But for the majority

So why do so many of us ‘off’ ourselves?

Because we don’t know how to live.

We don’t know how to enjoy. And we’re not okay with all of this other crap that's just 'in the way.'

We get thrust into the real world and suddenly our little fairy tale of everything being perfect and everyone giving a shit is broken.

Life isn’t pretty. It’s ugly

My point is… why aren’t we taught how to have a purpose?

Every single day of our lives as a school child we live under this false reality that life is meaningful

But there’s not a plan. Everyone is faking it. Things don’t work out and NOTHING is guaranteed.

The tricky thing about life is things only work out when you make them work out and that’s the problem.

We are never taught how to work things out on our own. We aren’t taught how to problem solve or emotionally take care of ourselves. We aren’t taught the basic fundamental needs that life requires.

So why

Because they can’t handle this. They can't handle life.

They can't handle the reckless thoughts and emotions that eventually cloud their minds when their carefully crafted framework is broken.

They can't handle the fact that every time they look outside

Sure

But for those of us that can’t… we’re left with the gigantic task of actually figuring out how to live and be happy.

The problem is though

So we get stuck… man

And we can’t quite figure out why we feel what we feel and we have no fucking clue what to do about it.

And we look around and we see so many fucking people seemingly living happy

But the truth is… they aren’t happy. At least not the ‘real’ happy. They’re just wasting their days away until one day they’re going to wake up and ask

So maybe these feelings that I’m having now are a blessing in disguise.

Maybe my mental confusion will somehow bring me out ahead in this conundrum.

Maybe… just maybe my realization that everything is bullshit will enable me to see life for what it really is and enjoy it for what it really is. Maybe this will allow me to saddle up and ride it for what its worth.

But I do know this:  So many people before me that have felt the same way and have tried to overcome these feelings have failed. Each year the suicide rate rises.

Do I want to become another statistic? God

But these feelings aren’t easy to deal with

Like I said… how can we 'live' if we don't know how? 

But each passing day I can see why they choose that way out.

It’s not our fault that we’re brought into a world and taught a certain framework of living that just doesn’t hold up under a microscope.

It’s not our fault that no one showed us the way.

So to those of you out there like me who feel lost… empty… bored… and hopeless…

Here’s to you.

Here’s to hoping that somehow we can logically think our ways through this tangled framework of lies called life.

Here’s to hoping we can be happy again... like we used to be when everything was meaningful and nothing hurt.",,t5_2qho7,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/19s5u2/im_on_the_verge_of_insanity_so_i_wrote_a_little/

Back in 2008 I was making 40k a year and living the dream. I was cocky and didn't understand how lucky I was to have a well paying job with benefits. Needless to say I left the company due to me thinking I could get better pay somewhere else. I cant say that I had worst timing, I took on a job waiting tables to make ends meat. It was funny because even when I was working at the bottom I still had a pep in my step. An aura that I knew I didn't belong there and lived and expected better things to come. 

I was able to get another desk job later that same year but at the start of 2009 the company had massive lay-offs and I was out a job this time out of no fault of my own. Again I was back to square one. Believe it or not I spent 9 months on unemployment living off $1600 a month. My monthly bills were $2500

I took my job as a server back where I was the year before. It was nostalgic in a way and also humiliating. I knew I was destined for greater things and the staff at this resturant took pleasure in seeing me come back. Not that they want me to fail but because that validates their own stagnate lifestyle. Many of these people are career waiters and in my opinion it is pathetic because some of these people are brilliant but lack the ambition to take chances. I worked as a server for 6 months before finding a new job.

I found a job with a shady Door to Door sales dept. I sold *** Services door to door! This was nuts the lifestyle was wild but the pay was good. I did so good at the job that my boss asked me to go with him to out of town to open a new office. Fresh leads and better pay was the promise.  I had nothing to lose so I left. 

The summer of 2010 I spent 1400 mi away from home. Talk about stressfull. I had a mortgage and a car to pay back home but work up north. Needless to say this place was a hell hole. We got leads in the ghetto of town. I got robbed on the street, no food, miles away from family, no way to make it home what so ever. I thought I was done! I remember buying an bag of potatos because we could eat that for weeks and they would not go bad. Also I lived out of my car for awhile too. It was rough. I was poor, homeless, and the only friends I had with me, I just met that year.  I had to come back. Luckly my boss was fed up with the city too and decided to come back to my hometown. I convinced him to take me with him. 

Once I was back I home I made a promise to myself to not let things get out of hand again. I was very tired of the Door to Door scene as well. Although I was making good money the job was horrible and hours long. A person who I was trying to sell stuff to worked for a good company and recommened me for the job. I was interviewed along with 300 people and I was 1 of 5 people to get the job. Just like that I went from having nothing to a 100k a year job. I am sitting a work with a smile on my face and feeling like I won the lottery everday at work.

Yes

The thing is I was prepared at any point to lose it all but knowing that I would work to get it all back if that happend. I came close to losing everything many times. But every time I hit rock bottom. I found a way to pull myself back up. I am not out of the woods yet. I have massive debt

When I was 17 years old (I’m now 20) I decided I wanted to take a risk and pursue a pro hockey career instead of going to college. Shortly after I graduated I signed my first pro contract and began my career. By October of my rookie season I had earned the starting spot (I’m a goalie) and I was on top of the world




The entire summer I was in the gym 4-5 hours a day and putting my absolute 100% into making my dream come true. I went back into training camp in August 2011 with more passion and determination than I can describe. That’s when disaster struck. Both my hips blew out to the point that I could barely walk. At the time I assumed it was simply a strain or bad pull. The team then sent me home to see a doctor and get the problem taken care of.




I got home and the doctor initially thought it was a torn groin, and CT scans done on both hips/groins. When I went to meet with the surgeon to see the results nothing could have prepared me for what he was about to say. He walked in with 2 other doctors and said “Son. What kind of education do you have and what are your plans after hockey?”. I instantly knew this bad news. The ball in both my hip joints was not round and as a result it ground away the cartilage in both hip. On top of that I had torn muscles in both hips and a torn groin on the left side. I was then told they were going to try to fix me but I would probably never play hockey again. For a 19 year old to hear they can no longer do what they’ve their entire life its devastating. Especially when I came as close to achieving my dream as I did. I broke down crying right there in the doctors office and could barely get the words out of my mouth when talking to my dad on the phone on the drive home.




I got the surgery done and my first words after coming out of anesthesia were “Can I play hockey again?”. The surgeon said “I don’t know” which is as good as a no. After 8 weeks on crutches and 8 weeks of rehab I got surgery on my other hip and it went better. I was determined I was going to play hockey again no matter how much pain I had to go through, I had persevered through the biggest challenge of my life. Then a week before I was getting ready to go to training camp both hips blew out again in August. I was in surgery the next.




Fast forward to right now. I had my fourth surgery 3 weeks ago (2 on each hip) and I’m not doing well physically or mentally. The damage was so severe in my hips that a lot of it is permanent and I’m in constant pain but the mental pain is even worse. I feel like I’ve lost my identity. I put so much work and heart into hockey that I don’t know who I am without it. Its all I’ve ever done. I sit at home and watch my friends sign NHL contracts while I can’t even walk without crutches. I always thought as long as I worked as hard as I possibly could that good things would happen, twice.  Sometimes I’ll be laying in bed and it just hits me and I cant help but cry. It such a bad feeling to be 20 years old and already feel washed up. I’ve lost the one thing that I identified myself as and it feels like there a big hole in my gut, like a huge part of me is gone. 




How do I pick up the pieces and move on? I hope within a year or so I’ll be physically well enough to function but mentally I’ve been having such a hard time for the last year. I need any kind of advice you guys have. I don’t care if it’s a story of a similar experience or just philosophy




Thank you so much for the help.

I've written a suicide letter

Why am I so depressed? I really don't know. I can't say my life is hell but it is pretty sad. I'm going in my 3rd year of University, thinking i am akward, weird, emotional and soft. I try to stay quiet and not be singled out but the second i open my mouth people automatically see the weirdo in me. I have friends yes but it feels like I cannot make meeningfull connections with anyone around me. It's like i'm that guy who's name and face you always forget but is always around with the group of friends and if you do remember me it's nothing good.

Out of frustration, the air around me and when i do speak I simple don't talk like a normal person, like i'm empty.

I believe it. Why? I have almost no interests in any aspects of life

I know some of you are probably rolling your eyes and going first world problems and you're probably right, i'm wondering if anyone else feel the same; like an empty shell that just pretends to keep a smile on but is completly broken inside.

I've gone to therapy, stood infront of the mirror every morning for months and say i'm happy and positve; and was on anti depressants for almost 2 years. Yet it keeps getting worse.

About a month ago I met up with a friend whom i had not seen in 6 months and within five minutes of being with her she told me my depression had gotten much worse. She cuddled me and almost cried for me telling me she is very worried about my mental health and wishes it could all go away. Another example would be one of my sisters. She came over to drop off something for my mother and in the 15 mins she saw me

When people ask me what is wrong with me, girls find me very good looking, have a good roof over my head, i'm very healthy (physically), and have good food on the table everyday. Yet it feels like i'm going nowhere in my life. I feel hopeless, meeningless and that I have no emotions except all the bad ones. I know people with less than half than what I have yet they are twice as happy in their lives. 

I've learned that depression is all in your head it's just an idea a thought. Yet that thought won't go away and DOMINATES my psyche. I mumble to myself throughout the day about killing myself and how much I hate life. I'll have random moments where I just stop everything I do and just shut down, I just have random outbursts of screaming and crying and yelling out loud that I want to die.....and those kind of outbursts are starting to happen in public.

Why have i not killed myself yet? i'm too scared of death and dying a painfull death.

I never really have had any luck with these things. Part of my problem is even typing these words out. I'll be lucky to even type a paragraph before I decide it all sounds ridiculous and erase it completely, electricity, or telephones. My parents both come from ""well to do"", middle-class families and in their primes both achieved college level education, but man did they suck at managing their expenses. On the other end of the spectrum, however, I have experienced luxuries some people only dream of. 

When I was 8 my parents split up, I was scared I was going to lose the only person that took care of me. She ended up meeting my step dad through the internet ,a few months prior to when she was diagnosed (The AOL 4.0 Days). As a result he asked her to come to California , where he proposed to her and thanks to this she was able to have her cancer treated under his health insurance. After I was 12 years old I had a great childhood, we had moved to California and my quality of life had never been better. My step-dad really helped me integrate into the whole California lifestyle, got me into music heavily, and as if it was almost a California decree I started to play guitar, I shot up cocaine for my last 2 years of high school after I realized it was *the way* to get the drug into my system; I was even loaded on my graduation day. A few months after graduation when I was looking for places with my mom, whom she thought were the source of influence, told me she couldn't afford me living there anymore and told me to come back home. At this point I realized the pain and torture I had subjected my mother to and honestly started to cool down on my life style. When I moved back to my home town I enrolled in the local community college and had a pretty good semester there

It was St. Patricks day, this in turned led them to call for some ""backup"", which led to me getting a bottle upside my head that also managed to slit my throat clean open. I lost 2 Liters of my blood struggling to keep myself alive. My best friends staring at me in complete fucking terror. The only thing I could think about is how my mom will wake up in the morning to hear the news that her son is dead. I felt so fucking guilty, so fucking unfulfilled and I was so angry. I had been unjustly picked out and targeted, for some stupid fucking kids idea of proving a point. I was so disappointed with my life and this point and wanted nothing more than another chance, my life had been cut short!  But low and behold, I am alive, but he only ended up getting 2 years. 

Since then I have moved on with my life and have moved far far away from California, bought myself a brand new car, and have a wonderful and loving girlfriend who loves me more than I can even understand. 

But day to day I find myself getting more and more depressed and am at a loss in trying to understand why, mainly because I had intented to come here, study, and then go back to california with my degree, but my girlfriend has sort of ridden me of any of those plans since she is still studying and has a very strong family value in her household, everyone seems to stick around. Within the last few months my dog in California passed away, and I feel as if I have been Robbed of my best friend, and honestly it weighs heavily on my heart, and I am typically the one that supports her the most. With the lost of our dog

Now I am sitting here, she doesn't seem to be partial to the fact that I honestly want to go back home. This is due to underlying trust issues which would take an entire post to explain why they even exist. My life is honestly a fucking mess I don't know how to deal with. My ability to make friends has since disappeared, I have no true friends here where I live and honestly feel so alone sometimes. My girlfriend has been sort of smothering me lately, and it's getting to the point where I can't deal with it anymore. But then I think about how alone I am, and I become grateful that she is constantly willing to be with me and drive to wherever I am working just to eat lunch with me... It makes me appreciate her... but I feel like it's something I am letting spiral out of control... I honestly am feeling hopeless... my thoughts and ideas of suicide are not solely because it's what comes to my mind as a dramatic end-all, but more so because honestly I feel like it is the most comforting and secure solution. 

I don't know what to do reddit...I dont know what to do world...I dont know if the drugs have affected my rational way of thinking, but do talk within eachother... I am not a recluse asshole, I do still have some of the outgoing qualities I had before all the crazy shit in my life happened... but I feel like I get shot down way too easily, and even though I consciously recognize this... I can't for the life of me change it! I feel like my attitude about everything has gone down hill... I just dont know what to do anymore...I also have had a history with self-inflicted wounds and honestly it has started to affect me more now than it did before when I was just a kid ""cutting"" myself. I see the scars all over my arms and legs and I just feel like such a fucked up individual...  now I dont use a knife , I simply punch walls and a few days ago I fractured my knuckle punching my wall after a small argument with my girlfriend... Ughh I am getting tired of talking about myself..

I'm a 20 year old male who enjoys guns/beer/man stuff etc. as well as the notebook and being open with people such and such. This is not be asking to be less girly but to be able to control my emotions when I need to. 

My problem is when I need to confront someone about how I feel about them or if they treated me with a bit of disrespect I begin to tear up and end up becoming a blubbering mess towards that end. 

For example, chucked the plate on the floor shattering the plate, and walked away. He startled me with his rage and I began to just cry. He scared me, my co-worker asked what was going on. I was about to explain but the thought of talking about it brought on the water works. This happened about a year ago. 

A little more background. After a while I moved from being a cashier to becoming an floor associate in the paint department. Also for that last 6 months I was only working three days a week

This next event happened today maybe about an hour ago. Our store is restoring some wooden signs for city hall. We stripped it, it doesn't change. Same thing every day."" But in a really demeaning put-down sort of way. I wanted to tell her that I appreciate you reminding me but didn't you need to make it sound like I was wasting time and goofing off. That this was the first Monday in 4-5 months that I had worked. It just slipped my mind. But just the thought of talking to her brought tears to my eyes and I had to walk away from her out of embarrassments. 

What I guess I'm asking is how do I control my emotions/not cry when I want to confront someone about how I feel or about what just occurred. Also is this a normal thing? Or am I just being a big baby about what's going on and just need to ""toughen up""?

Happiness just seems so far away to me right now.  It seems like everyone around me is getting married, and generally doing the things I thought I would be doing at this age (29/m).  All of my close friends are married or in long term relationships, so I don't have a close group of friends to confide in like I used to.  When I do go out, it's usually with acquaintances I know from work or old college buddies but I feel like I'm an outsider who is just hanging with their group.

A lot of the advice I'm probably going to receive is going to be something along the lines of how I need to learn to be comfortable with myself,  I have hobbies, interests and aspirations.  I go to the gym 5 times a week and get out of the house as much as I can but nothing seems to fill the void.  I think what I really want is to be a part of something and/or be accepted, which goes against the advice of most people on here and other self help forums.  I know that you shouldn't need to seek the approval of others but I feel like that's exactly what would make me happy.  How can I learn to be happy being alone when I feel like being alone is what is making me unhappy?

I'm really good at pretending I'm happy.  If you and I were to hang out this weekend

I get really frustrated with myself because I know there are people who are much worse off than I am and it almost makes me feel like I'm being pathetic.  I almost feel guilty because I have everything I could possibly need and there are people who would kill to have what I have

I am a 23 year old college student in my fifth and final year.  I am a philosophy major which I now regret but I want to finish it so that I can at least have a bachelors degree.  I do not know what I want to do with my life as far as career is concerned.  I have been in a relationship with a girl for 5 years and i was weeks away from proposing to her when she broke up with me about 3 weeks ago.  We lived together and had a cat together and this has been extremely hard on me.  I was forced to move out of my apartment and I moved in with a friend recently.

The point of this post however is my lack of motivation.  Even long before the break up I had become so bad about procrastination on my school work that I almost always turn things in late if at all.  If I have a large assignment or paper hanging over my head I will avoid going out with my friends and doing fun things because I ""Have to do homework"" and then I will spend the entire night online just procrastinating and dicking around on the internet.  Every half hour I will tell myself ""in just one more half an hour I have to start my homework or I am FUCKED"" and this continues often until I have to go to school.  I get hardly anything done and I don't get hardly any sleep.   My homework just piles up as I keep putting it off.

This being my final semester

I thought that the change of pace of moving out of my apartment and in with my friend might give me a chance to really buckle down and do my homework

* Maintaining a full

* Alcohol is going to be very tricky, it's the loss of my relationship that I feel most acutely.

Going through these observations, probably piece by piece, but it's something.  I know I have some obstacles to making positive changes - among them, resistance to the very notion of making conscious changes to myself, and some skepticism about the possibility of doing so.  I do hope I can make incremental changes, though, see some benefit

Thanks again for your insights.

At the young age when she was learning to read and write, she was also trying to figure out something dark and scary that was happening to her at night. She would wake up naked. Many questions like, “Did I undress myself while I was sleeping?” and “how did I get to this part of the house?” would cross her mind. She was confused for years and thought that there was something wrong with her at the time. Until one night, she was awoken in her sleep and found her step grandfather on top of her. Scared, confused and barely awake she quickly closed her eyes and told herself that it was a bad nightmare. Like most kids, they close their eyes when they want something to disappear. She woke up later to find what she thought was vomit, at the time

She grew up in a sexually, over is head, while she took cover on her bed and begged for her life. “Daddy please don’t hurt me”, she cried over and over. Like a mad man he stabbed the knife into her bed mattress over and over and over again. She went into shock when she saw how close she came to being killed. Her father was puncturing the bed just a few inches away from her body. “Did he miss intentionally?”, she wondered. She survived yet another life threatening situation. When she was about 14, her dad lost it again. This time he took a loaded gun and pointed it directly at her head, while her mother frozenly watched. Tired of the constant beating, “go ahead

At this point

That little girl was ME. After many unsuccessful attempts to kill myself, to GROW and to LOVE. So I decided to fight for the life that I wanted.  I was so imprisoned by my past and I realize that the only way to free myself from that bondage was to forgive and free my heart of any hate or resentments. I eventually forgave my parents.  Since then, I’ve observed how the power of forgiveness transformed our lives. The thing is, I always loved them and I never stopped. All I wanted was for them to Love me too. So I had to be the bigger person. I realize that every good person has a breaking point and is capable of something bad and vise versa. 

I am now in my 30’s. I’ve grown physically, I traveled all over the world and I loved with all my heart. I am living the life I want and I will continue to fight for the happiness that we all deserve. I am sharing my story, hoping that it would inspire you to never give up and continue fighting for the life you want. I especially want to reach out to all the teens contemplating suicide. Trust me, it gets better. Stay strong and don’t let life get the best of you. Give life your best and live to watch it transform into something beautiful.

For the past 10 years I've essentially been doing the same thing.  Going to work and spending my free time playing games

I haven't even finished high school, yet I can't get the motivation to do it.  I've been lurking the various motivational subreddits for months, but it hasn't helped.

I've barely achieved much of anything in my life.  I was always a poor student (C average), I don't have a link to the study).  Despite this I've always had motivational problems even in the few things I'm actually interested in.  I have many things left unfinished and I just can't get around to doing them.

I've never actually talked to anyone about this (Fear is the main reason, and it feels like I'm going to run out of time soon.  If I lose my job I don't really know how I'll get another one as my current work is due to connections my parents had.

The other issue I deal with a lot is depression and wanting to just kill my self.  I've had suicidal thoughts since I was 11 and I have attempted hanging my self a few years ago.  The only thing that stopped me was that it would make my family sad and I don't want to put them through that.  Otherwise I'd just like to disappear.  

I really don't know what to do anymore and feel like I'm nearing the edge of a cliff.  I've tried going back to school a few times but I end up feeling ashamed.  Even if I did finish my adult grad, a good job, and a loving wife and having kids.  Yet, it seems like I don't even want those things either.  I could buy a car, rent out an apartment or something, I can afford those things.  If I were to go to university or college, I don't even know what for.  I've been thinking about a future career since I was 13 and still haven't figured it out.  

Relationships are something I completely missed out on since I left high school when I was 13 since I just didn't fit in.  I ended up doing at home correspondence school

I think overall I hate my self for not being like other people.  I look at my brother and sister, living on their own, working towards whatever dream or goals they have, and most are in some kind of relationship.  I on the other hand have barely moved forward.

I've been having this issue since I was a toddler of crying for the most minor thing ever, my cheeks start to turn pink/red and hot and my eyes start watering. It's very embarrassing, and at the same time, I really want to fix this. I want to avoid getting yelled at, so I try not to make any mistakes... and the second I do, the tears come back.


[I have this teacher who pulled me out of class one day to talk to me about my behavior. I do agree that I was being disrespectful for not responding to him

Is it because I feel like I receive a lot of attention (from the class) (I don't like attention like this)? Is it because my teacher reminds me a lot about my father (who I dislike)? Is it because crying became an involuntary reaction? Is it because I wanted him to understand that I wasn't having a great day or that I wasn't a morning person


I also start tearing up from being told that my answer is wrong in front of a class. (Background info: when I was in elementary school, but sometimes I'd answer a question wrong here and there; happens to everybody. When I answered a question wrong, I'd start tearing up because I can hear people say ""Oh my god [mikunegi] made a mistake~"" ""Wow THAT [mikunegi] made a mistake?!"" ""Woahh no way she answered that wrong, even I knew the right answer."")

First

Secondly, dysfunctional home. My parents are extremely negative people who raised me to believe I'm nothing but an unkind, horrible person who deserves equally horrible treatment from others and an awful life. 

I'm not close with my family at all; they haven't expressed affection or have told me they love me since I was a really young child. Their attitudes towards me were further reinforced in my first few relationships with men; my first ""serious"" boyfriend emotionally abused and manipulated me for roughly a year and a half before I broke up with him. My next two boyfriends were not class acts either. I've been cheated on multiple times. I'm currently in my first healthy

For the record

**What I'm currently struggling with:**

* I feel like I've hit an emotional slump for the past month. I can't seem to get back on my feet. I've been more paranoid and emotional than usual. On days that I don't work

* My confidence has ebbed and flowed this past semester. I was on a good confidence streak for quite some time, I'll question if he really meant it or not, said it just to satisfy me, etc.); I can't snap out of this mindset. For instance, I'm ""convinced"" that my friends and boyfriend think I'm a bad person, and are ashamed of me and the fact that I have anxiety/depression. I don't entirely understand how I can be fair, assertive, and yet be so cynical and irrational outside of those contexts. I'll try my best to employ techniques that I've been taught in therapy

* I'm scared that the good things in my life (friends, my boyfriend is currently working on getting his motorcycle license. Ever since he started the process to getting it, I constantly worry that ""the end is near"" and that he'll either be killed or seriously injured out on the road unless I'm a ""perfect"" girlfriend. He isn't a reckless person, but I'm scared of other drivers hurting him. When hanging out, I have these scary thoughts of ""...you better enjoy these last few months with him..."" and so forth. I equally worry that I ""deserve"" that level of trauma in my life. As much as others tell me I'm a sweet and caring person, I'm absolutely terrified that I'm an inherently evil, terrible person.

* I've become increasingly ""clingy"" in my interpersonal relationships. I've been feeling lonely lately despite the fact that I've gone out quite a bit since graduation and see my friends/boyfriend on a regular basis. If someone can't meet up on a particular day, I beat myself up for being too ""clingy"" and ""needy."" What is going on here? Again, I was doing just fine not too long ago; I was balanced and rational. I feel like I've lost that mindset.

* Regarding my relationship and sex life, I've noticed that it has become part of how I view myself and my own femininity. I haven't been able to reach orgasm via penetration for the past month and it's wearing me down. I feel like less of a woman. I don't feel beautiful, graceful, or romantic when I either can't achieve orgasm period or when I have to use another method to get there. While my boyfriend assures me it's fine and that it happens every now and then, I worry that he'll get frustrated and either 1) leave me, or 2) cheat on me. The latter situation is incredibly out of character for him (he's the kind of guy who wouldn't hurt a flea), but I'll still get thoughts/worries of it happening. Obviously, it's going to deter me from reaching orgasm. I always think ""it will happen next time"" when it doesn't happen

**[End NSFW part]**

Again, how can I tell them how to react and approach my current stress?

I would be extremely grateful for any encouragement or general advice.

**TL;DR: Fell into an anxiety/paranoia slump and don't know how to relax and get back up again. Convinced my [otherwise extremely kind] friends and boyfriend hate me.

However I had a very good network of friends back home that I had built up over a long time and now that is all gone so the problem is much more apparent.

Apparently I ""don't know when to stop talking""

To me silence feels unnerving in any situation where other people are in the room (to the point it is absolutely unbearable and I will say just about anything I can think of just to fill the void). Background music or being really tends to fix this but not always. 

People say that I explain things past where I need too and that it comes off as forceful. This ends up in many conversations where other people get defensive and begin to argue with me then consider me to have been looking for an argument or to have started it when I had absolutely not intention of arguing (and sometimes didn't even realize it was an argument). Also I find it hard to tell if people are interested in what I am talking about.

I feel that this is a slightly different problem but when I get really excited about pretty much anything my volume goes way up and I don’t realize it one bit (probably because I’m too caught up being exited with what I’m excited about).

In an odd way I notice that many of my friends admit that they didn't like me when they first met me but then learned to get by/ignore my quirks

As an aside

tl;dr
I naturally talk to the point or in a way that other people find me very annoying and I find it very uncomfortable/difficult when I try and fix this. Looking for other people who have gone through the same thing or just some genuine advice.

I'm 16. Still living at home obviously with my mom and stepdad and siblings. But last week is when I knew I had to draw the line. It started with my mom wanting me to drive her to the minimart to get some groceries. Now my mom has a breathilizer in her car and she claims she couldn't do it herself because she was taking cough medicine. I didn't believe her but I needed some stuff also
So I'm doing my shopping and she tells me to pull around the car. This sounds pretty suspicious, the last time my mom was drinking he swore that he would leave if he caught her again (this is a example of how my family enables her, no doubt) He asks her about it, she denies, he drops it completely. So here I am, angry, upset, so I leave to my friends house.
 I stay at her house a couple days and on the second day my mom sends me a text saying ""I don't know what you saw but I'm innocent! I love you."" Now, doesn't answer. Sinking to her level I send her a text saying, ""Do you swear on my life that you did not buy vodka?"" she says yes. Now I know with my heart and soul that she bought it and hid it. I mean I saw it. Anyways I grit my teeth and soon have to go home. I'm brief with my mom and try to show her I'm still mad and not letting her get away with what she's done like everyone else. I've been spending the last days over at my grandmas, who lives 30 minutes away. I talked to her about it and she thinks I should stand my ground to show her that she can't get away with that. Therein lies the fucking tragedy. I want my mom to see that she has hurt me many times and hopefully to convince her that enough is enough. But I don't want to spend two years not speaking to my mom. On average when she's not drinking, we have a semi-good relationship. We watch shows together, talk, ect. But she has fucked it up once again.

My beautiful girlfriend of 6 months and I have been happily dating with few complications to this day. However

In fact, to present an opportunity to get back with him (since he was the one that severed ties in the first place) when I was already in the picture. I was there when she was faced with this decision, and she was there to witness the pain I felt the following days until she ultimately decided to stick with me because a) This guy life was headed down the wrong path after their breakup, and b) I ultimately was the better man with my life more-or-less figured out.

From then until now, very compatible. I never was actually able to let go of the fact that she nearly ended our relationship that fateful night revolving the Ex-Bf, and as I had mentioned before, it always unsettled me to see her maintain a healthy contact with him. Time and time again though, she would assert that she would never go back to him and was certain she made the right choice in choosing me.  

Warp ahead to this past weekend after we had spent the entire time together, she would only respond with one word answers and nothing more. On Tuesday, it was more or less the same treatment, none of her usual cute messages were sent to me, and she made no attempt to see me which I found quite odd. When it came to today, I texted her what she had been up to lately because she seemed distant. I get a response almost 4 hours later that she was busy with school and that 'she'd like to talk to me.' I see this as a huge indication that she's going to break up with me tomorrow when I meet up with her after her class at 11:30.

So to sum up this huge backstory

What scares me the most is that I'm not sure how much of an impact the destruction of a 3 year relationship had on my overall passion for life.

I know it hurts him that I don't trust him and I don't want to live with the constant fear that comes with paranoia.

I've allowed depression and sickness to take over my life. I wake up in the morning knowing I have to go to school and just not feeling like I can. I feel anxious and terrified, I'm not good enough for the classes. and honestly, at this point I feel as though I should just kill myself and save everyone the trouble. I don't have any friends at school, it's predominately black, Asian and middle-eastern students that like to be with each other, making it almost impossible for me to make new friends. I'm in grade 11 with only 12 out of the 24 credits that I should have.

I don't know how to pick myself up and feel okay about going to school again, but I don't think they'll take me with my attendance and credit problem. and I'm not sure how to even switch.

Let me explain: We've been married a little over a year. During the time we dated we definitely got drunk together like any mid twenties couple might, I'd feel embarrassed but chalk it up to his anxiety around people that were my friends or family. 



The first time I realized this might be more was a little after we were engaged. We went to a family birthday dinner but were late in arriving because he had to work. It was about an hour away. When we got there, but not before he downed a last drink. We checked into a hotel and I tried to sleep while he tried to ""seduce me"". 



Cut to about a year later, I started noticing how he was when he came home and started getting angry and worried about his behavior. 



If you've ever seen the show Breaking Bad (and this is reddit, getting mad at you because you woke up from a restless sleep when you heard the eye of the stove being turned on and angrily turned it off again because he had four eyes on and nothing cooking. (yup. I can actually hear this because I know what to listen for when he is like this, and can wake up from whatever sleep I'm getting) Then imagine that same restless sleep being waken by another all too familiar sound: urination that isn't making that particular tinkling in the bowl it should be making. I think I've caught him peeing somewhere he shouldn't be about three times in the past year. Once he was aiming but missing the toilet. Once he was peeing in the recycling bin. Once, I just discovered a wet floor when I woke up in the morning. Fun! And then I get preemptively mad when I see him come home like this because I know I'm in for a night of frustrating ""babysitting"".



It's getting embarrassing to be around his friends because even though they're drinking, said he was putting the stuff in the car before saying his goodbyes. Then we can't find the things and it takes him a week to locate them. He had put them into another guest's car that looks nothing like ours. I had to drag him away from the party before this, and then wander around hoping to find where he'd stashed his expensive toys. Friends stopped to help and though they were gracious, it was humiliating.


Tonight he said he was going to just pop into a party for a co-worker who lives within walking distance. Even though it was 9pm on a Friday I was tired and wanted to stay in, the birthday girl is a lesbian in a relationship and two, I've never known him to look seriously at another girl at a party ever.)


I've talked to him about this before, though he sometime drinks at home when I've gone to bed.


Sorry for this long rant. Here's what I really want your advice on:
How can I talk to my husband in a way that will help him see I really just want him to take care of himself and be safe and responsible? What should I say? What should I not do? And does anyone have experience with this that has become positive? I've done research and therapy might help him get this under control and allow him to even drink socially but not binging

**Time Management** In terms of time management, aren't your job to do etc. We must only do that which really matters and let the small things truly slide. 

Then after that it's how can you do this thing in the most efficient way possible? This is the realm of time management. Paretos rule states that 80% of desired output comes from 20% of input across a wide variety of areas so we must let go of the inefficient 20% and either save 80% of our time or we can do the job of 5 men by being more efficient. 

Another great too is Parkinsons Law. This is the law which states that a task swells to fill the time allotted for it. We all have assignments that we do at the last minute. If you set a specific self created deadline for something it will get done in that amount of time

**Boredom** - We all experience boredom in our lives and I've had long periods of meditation (upto 4 hours/day for 1 month once) and one way around it is to be completely aware of whatever you're doing. When you become totally visually aware of what's around you or simply hearing the raindrops falling on the window so crisply you can never be bored. Simply being present with a cup of water is a beautiful experience. Giving it your fullest attention. Life is joyous. Complete concentration is achievable through practice. See Eckhart Tolles ""The Power of Now"" for other tips. 

**Emotional Upheaval** - We also all have negative and conflicting emotions (one conscious and the other subconscious) and a great method of releasing these emotions so we can see more clearly can be found in a book by Hale Dwoskin called ""The Sedona Method"". IT teaches you to recognise an emotion and through a simply series of questions release it with the final root emotion being that of fear of death. 

**Creating Habits** - Habits are what make us. We are all creatures of habit and as the proverb goes

30 days is long enough for you to know that at the end of it you can simply switch back to whatever your older routine was but it's just as easy to keep at it. Success is put on autopilot this way as we just set habits that make us what we want to be and allow time to bring us success.

 If you are unconfident with setting habits then start small and work your way up. You can just say ""For the next 30 days

**Socializing** - We also all need to socialize and communicate with other humans much to our chagrin. I deep down believe that each human is alive on Earth to help each other grow. We come up against our ego again and again when we meet other people and it gives us an excellent opportunity to let it go and have an increased sense of peace. The greatest book I've read in this area is Dale Carnegies ""How to win friends and influence people"". It's really cheap to buy on Amazon and a condensed page of notes can be found [here](http://www.westegg.com/unmaintained/carnegie/win-friends.html).

This is my life lessons and things I have learned over the years. Its how I live my life and wanted to share it with others to see what they thought of it.
(btw this is on a paper I wrote to myself and I have edited it over the years. It is written directed to myself and myself as the audience. I have no idea if that makes any sense lol)


Confidence is a state someone refers themselves because they tend to stay in a confident state more often than any other state. (oppose to a shy state) When someone tries to become ""confident"" there is usually a big misconception. There is a high possibility of acting arrogant or awkward when they fake confidence.

If someone says they want to become more confident I believe they should be saying they want to be truly happy with them self. I believe if you want to achieve genuine confidence then you need to be happy with your life and live by your core values. On a scale 1 to 10 of how happy are you

If you are faking in being confident then you are faking that you are genuinely happy with being yourself. There is nothing confident in pretending to be confident. You are not living with your emotions, and not hiding them away from others. If you become completely honest with yourself you become more self accepting.

When you were younger people would always tell you that to become more confident you should stop caring what people think of you. They probably could have said this A LOT better. If you have strong values then you don't need to seek validation because you are already happy and the only thing you should be doing is giving to others. This means you aren't accepting anything in return because don't need anything from them. You become self-reliant.
Becoming truly happy is very simple. The problem with simplicity is that it is hard to interpret it because you need to be willing to do something different from what other people do. It has been hard to share your philosophy with your closest friends and you shouldn't try to change people who do not want to change. You may not even be changing them for the better.  Not many people can hold the quality of becoming genuinely happy with themselves until an old age. Even then it seems very rare. 
From observing people from all ages it seems these are three things that stick out that hold them back into becoming happy.


1) Appreciation. A problem I'm sure you remember when you started weight lifting was you compared yourself to others. (Remember how it only took you a day to overcome this? LOL I'm happy for who gave me this life lesson on a forum) If you compare yourself to other people it's a sure way to become a miserable person. You need to become aware of what you have in life. People go through life not aware of what they really have. The worst is how people my age are so caught up on their own life problems and how they are growing older. They get so caught up on this that they forget to realize that their parents aren't getting any younger. I feel they won't appreciate their parents as much as they should until they're gone. That is a problem I feel most people have experienced (with family that passed away) or will experience in their life.
How often do you beat yourself down and compare it to how often you appreciate yourself and what's cool about yourself. This is realizing self appreciation. 
The more appreciation you show towards people the more they feel connected to you. You slowly become this charismatic being that people sense. Become more expressive 
with the world. 


2) Intentions. Another problem I feel people have is they lose track of their true intentions. What I mean by this is that people always make intentions for things they want to do
You can say ""I'm going to go to school today"" or ""I'm going to the gym/run some errands""
If you wake up and have the intention of feeling such as


3) Accountability.  In my opinion this is the hardest to recognize. Everything else may be simple but I feel some people cannot let go of their pride for there life to become accountable.
Why do I say this? It's because ACCOUNTABLE PEOPLE NEVER BLAME OTHER PEOPLE.
People who are accountable are in an attitude to learn from an event while people who are blaming others are stuck because they believe they're ""perfect""(they did nothing wrong or do not want to admit it) from what has happened. The example I always see is from playing team video games. The guy who blames their team is the one who isn't looking to improve because they believe they did nothing wrong. The reality is you could always improve. 
Why can you always improve? You become a leader in this world. Leaders are accountable and people who are accountable take initiative. In team games I have to act as the leader of a team of 5 random people or else everyone is going to blame each other if we lose at the end of the game. They could at least blame me for not leading them to victory.
People do not want to take the blame so they do not want to be held accountable but it makes you stronger. You become a powerful leader. Leadership isn't ""I am good at telling people what to do"" It's about becoming accountable.",,t5_2qho7,1340144746.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/v9aeq/what_it_means_to_be_confident_how_i_see/

1288357526.0,dy802,My revelation on helping to fix my endless cycle of procrastination...,proverbialwhatever,15,2,12,"Hi /selfhelp, but most life problems are usually nothing if not deep...

I've always been a terrible procrastinator. I fit the stereotypical traits: always leaving things to the last minute; wasting time on things that I don't even really enjoy; getting anxious as time goes on because I always have something to worry about - yet I have no desire to attend to it (which leads to a perpetuating cycle of self loathing); and so forth. This has generally related to my study habits, the task became incomparably easier, and having been blessed with a relatively decent intellectual brain, I was generally able to submit something (usually a day or two late at the most), and still get a half-decent mark, even after the penalties were applied.

Two psychological breakdowns and the realisation that I was an undiagnosed schizophrenic AND major depressive for over a decade later, I am much more relaxed, and I became for the first time that I could recall in a long time, happy and at peace within myself. It's great. This was all around 2 years ago now, and I'm still going strong.

But there is still a nagging behavioural trend that I have had exceptional trouble in shaking, but it just began with me not being able to get started - ""that's normal, no need to worry yet..."" - to simply not being able to relate to any sense of benefit that submitting the work will provide for me. I failed two of my subjects last year because I simply could *not* for the life of me bring myself to do the work. It led to another stumble into an anxious state of depression: feeling bad about myself because I was failing as a student (not to mention the fact that I was doing a disservice to myself), feeling that I was ruining my future, etc. This vicious circular thinking only led me to feel worse about myself, and the symptoms grew proportionately deeper. I took the coward's way out - in the end I didn't do the work required, and I subsequently failed. Things got better after gaining support from doctors and university officials, mainly because I wasn't beleaguered by the anxiety that the assessments led me towards.

Anyway. After 6 months off during which I attempted to stabilise, but getting started has proved pretty much beyond me.

Until last night. I had a conversation with a dear friend, but ""for some reason"", it was much more difficult to charge up the motivation to do things that would benefit ourselves, at least in our cases. This conclusion lasted until last night, during which we were discussing it again whilst I was venting over my concerns with procrastination. She brought up our conversations from last year, and I had a brainwave. I realised the connections between a few blindingly obvious things:

1. As sentient human beings, but as with all things, doing something to excess usually leads to things getting out of control. i.e. My procrastination from doing my assessments getting to the point of personal and professional disaster.

2. One of the reasons as to why we are willing to extend ourselves to other people in need is because there is a *tangible reward* to be found as a result of doing so. We feel happy that they have been helped by us, etc. We can also be happy because they are happy. I suppose it can be a mixture of selfish (yet not necessarily bad) and selfless reasons, whatever your motive is.

3. We also do things for ourselves that offer the prospect of **tangible, we eat a certain food because it is pleasing to us, and we feel the pleasurable effects immediately upon ingestion.

4. **The Problem**: Doing things for ourselves that involve rewards that are NOT immediately experienced - such as studying, which provides a return that is not immediate and may take some weeks to become realised - can take a back seat in priority against things that are more immediately rewarding, such as watching television, playing videogames, spending too much time on facebook and reddit, for example (things that I do, anyway). In my case, and as such I prioritised with doing more egoic

That was my problem. My sense of priority was not with the long-term goals. When I realised this last night, the confusion, the confliction, everything made sense, and was finally organised in my mind as a belief. I realised that I am a human being that has *wants and desires*. This is not a bad thing in itself, but the way in which I was choosing to express these facets of behaviour was not conducive to a healthy state of wellbeing for myself. So I was lead to make further conclusions:

1. I am a person that has wants and desires. So far my focus has been on obtaining immediate rewards as opposed to those found in the future
2. I decided that **I was worth the effort of going the hard yards and delaying gratification**. This was the idea that I could finally relate to personally. I could see myself now

If I had asked myself if I was worth the effort before my enlightening periods of personal breakdown, and will be working on another over the weekend.

I hope that I have explained myself effectively. I would assume that my experience will be relevant only to certain people and their procrastination, I'm much happier, I feel whole again, and I feel in touch with a sense of future that involves effort and putting in hard work, something formerly outside my dreaded comfort zone. To all my fellow downward-spiral slackers, I wish you wellness, happiness and luck!

TL;DR:
- We are creatures that possess innate sense of want and desire. These are not inherently bad things.
- Procrastination is, at least in my situation.
- I overcame my crippling and destructive procrastination by admitting my inherent weakness as a creature of desire
- The way I justified this was asking myself if I was worth the effort.
-Profit.

I hope this makes sense to y'all. Godspeed!",,t5_2qho7,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/dy802/my_revelation_on_helping_to_fix_my_endless_cycle/

I am a very attentive, and understanding person. These ""qualities"" have brought me happiness through making others happy, but they have also brought me sadness. 

At the end of the day, OCD... am I the way I am because of her? The last thing I want is to turn out like her, caged in by an uncontrollable fear that everything is going to go wrong or that everyone is annoyed by me at all times. 

As much as my big heart has set me apart in good ways, but these qualities open your heart up to the smallest problems and magnify them - sometimes you realize they aren't even problems at all and you've invented them in your head. For example, when you think someone might be upset with you, and then you realize that the issue hasn't even phased them. This happens to me every day. Every damn day. It's stressful! And can easily get me down...

I've met many people in my life... all kinds of them. The people I love the most are the people who are loud, the people who just don't give a fuck. I'm not talking about the quiet people who actually have a million insecurities underneath their layer of avoidance. I'm talking about the calm, confident, strong people that don't worry about anything (unless they really really have to). I know that every personality comes with its downsides, but I believe that a combination of the way I've been so far with being more ""chill"" can help me with a lot of my problems and insecurities. When I'm around ""chill"" people, I feel... weightless, happy, and they just laugh. Because nothing really mattered to them. I always hear the phrase

I feel like if I want to make it in life, it's too out of control and it's really setting me back. 

**TLDR; I am an outgoing, and compassionate person that values these qualities but struggles with their drawbacks - some anxiety and I worry too much. I've always been curious as to how people can be ""chill"" and just not give a shit. How can I be more like them? I believe this will make me stronger and happier.**",,False,,t5_2qho7,1365521844.0,,

Hi, but I've had a hard past. Thus, I am immature in some areas, though mature in others. It's embarrassing and causes issues. Today I'd like some input on one area.

To put it straight, and genuinely care about people and their interests and trails, and I'm proud of myself for that. This can set me up for pain though, because I'm not very forward, and kind of ""hide"" myself. I now leave people that are jerks or super self-centered, but I don't stand up for myself much or set clear boundaries (nothing sexual, only social) and I don't make my needs known (I have ideas that it's ""wrong"" or ""needy""). I had an it's-complicated crash and burn and looking back there were some small issues and big red flags I saw but rationalized. I believe much can be worked out and endured with love as the fuel. But I let my feels rationalize my brain when I *knew* there were problems

I think I have a very low standard for what I expect from people, I admire in myself and others like). I've even thought ""if I had an SO in the future cheat on me I probably wouldn't leave them"". At best I should say ""I will consider it then"", not already decide I'll stay. How messed is that?

The past 30 days have been some of the most tumultuous of my entire life. I graduated college a little over a month ago with a degree in Business Administration specializing in Marketing. I had no job but a “promising” internship that I had hoped would lead to a full time offer. I had a girlfriend of almost a year


After graduation I went on vacation with my family to North Carolina for a week, telling me the typical cliché “it’s not you, it’s me” and “I don’t feel the same way anymore.” At the time I was devastated, we had spoken about “us” long term and marriage 48 hours prior to her breaking up with me. We had known each other since freshman year and had a myriad of mutual friends. Coincidentally, I learned at my “promising” internship that same week that there would not be a job offer for me at the end of the summer.


At this point, I had applied to more than 50 jobs by the first week of July (I have the spreadsheet to prove it) with all them saying “I wasn’t who they were looking for.” I also was lucky enough to see my ex-girlfriend make out with some guy less than a week after we broke up. I was angry, depressed, sad, hurt, basically every sad adjective in the book. Thankfully, through a strong support system from my family and friends


I was more motivated than ever to prove myself right and put the past behind me. I applied to every job under the sun. I networked whenever and wherever. I accepted every cup of coffee and went to every happy hour. I told myself its not “if I get a job


Through patience and perseverance


The reason I wrote this was to remind myself to never give up hope. Life will knock you down, but through patience and determination you will achieve your goals.

* not thinking in terms of a unified image of myself and simply focusing on particular things without much perspective vs. thinking in terms of a unified image of myself

   I am 20 years old, also I have a history of alcohol dependence. I'm married to a marine who is about my age. She and I have been together for 2 years, and are about 3 months married. The problem here is that she has been sort of distant lately, not texting me much and not making time to call me. She is in her school before she gets her job, so she works a near normal work day. (Basically she has the evenings and weekends off for the most part.) I've been putting in a lot of extra effort to talk to her, but I feel like it isn't doing much. This is not the norm.

She is flying down in 2 days and we have christmas together, etc. 

Well the problem here is that I have been seriously depressed for the time that she has been acting like this. I have reoccurring dreams where I can't find her, and I've become dependent on her emotionally.

""An old Cherokee is teaching his grandson about life. ""A fight is going on inside me

""It is a terrible fight and it is between two wolves. One is evil - he is anger, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, lies, ""The other is good - he is joy, serenity

The grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather

The old Cherokee simply replied

It really made me stop in my tracks. Every feeling that the 'Evil' wolf represented was a feeling that I could clearly recall. UK btw.

Anger: A general feeling that overarches and is the product of the remaining feelings. It's a background noise that never surfaces.
Envy: I envy the offspring of richer families, but that does not negate the feeling of Envy. I envy those who with cash who are given it on a plate.
Sorrow: This feeling comes from a lack of hope. I don't have a plan for the future and I can't see further than one week ahead, because I love them, though I'd leave home if there was any point. Feels like I'm just waiting for the months to tick away and watch my savings slowly grow without anything to actually do with them. A helpless feeling.
Regret: I'm 23 and never had a proper girlfriend, and mutually so, but I didn't. I never act, and so regret is right up there.
Greed: I obsess over money and constantly thinking ways to really strike it big. Peculiarly, but at the end of the day I think far too much about how to make money and not enough time just enjoying life.
Arrogance, like a cheap little potshot 'told you so'. I hate this, and I wrestle my personality not to get carried away.
Self-pity: Well, but my Gremlin is here to stay until I make something dramatic happen to get free of it. Self-pity feeds straight into doubt, and I have so much doubt and tentativity about my convictions that I think way too much. I'm a good guy with good ideas but I rarely make them happen.
Resentment: If there's anyone I resent
Inferiority: I feel this one, that person. I know I can do great things without a degree - anyone can - but any high-potential person who is about to make an assault on the next project will surely understand that a label can be so powerful to your confidence.

My Evil wolf wants to make me think that everyone else has a plan but me, but I know that in actual fact I've acheived great things so far and that I'm simply punishing myself to ridiculous standards and not focusing on living.

The Good wolf. He's had a poor couple of years.

Joy: Not a lot to be joyous about in particular. Sometimes a bubble rises to the surface when I remind myself that I've got a low-stress job with a great boss and a real sense of contribution, work, sleep, work, sleep, work, sleep and the occasional gathering with friends, for us all the fight the boredom
Peace and Love: Peace must mean contentment. Not much of that, and lives at home with us. It's awkward not feeling like you can have a conversation with a full-grown man without fearing a snidey rebuttal or pseudo-tantrum. He's the very definition of a teenager in a man's body. Not much love there, either, then. As for love-love, I haven't been very successful there but I know that it's not because of who I am, it's because of dumb luck, or lack of it. It takes a collection of things to slot together for love to strike, though I don't seem to learn from them. My head knows that I've nothing to worry about
Humility and Generosity: Two things that I, I feel at my best. I love to give my time to my friends, but is that simply to remind them why I'm good to have around?

She was on a medication for her 'episodes' that left her severely depressed and she ended up a few years ago discussing with me the plans of her suicide.

I forgive myself that I have accepted and allowed myself to believe that I will be able to walk this process without establishing a point of self-stability and self-trust which can only be accumulated and developed through consistently applying and living my self-forgiveness and self-corrective application to one point at a time release the systems and limitations that I have allowed myself to become throughout the years of my life.

I forgive myself that I have accepted and allowed myself to not see or realize that the process that I am walking is specific to my own life and my own points of accumulation as separation and backchat and thus I am in a specific time-line and allocation within this reality – meaning I am only able to walk my own specific process because the points that I have allowed myself to be controlled by are specific to my particular placement within this world and are influenced by the extent to which certain systems have manifested within me – thus it is impossible to compare my process to the process that is walked by another even if it appears to me that another being is doing 'better' or 'ahead' of me or somehow just 'better than me' because I perceive them to have transcended points that I struggle with or perceive them as easily being able to handle, which blinds me from seeing the other being for who and what they are unconditionally but rather as a symbol and 'guidepost' which I judge myself by and react to based on whether or not I believe the other being is 'better than me' due to perceiving them to have walked through or are 'easily directing' points that I experience difficulty with and have not fully integrated yet.

I forgive myself that I have accepted and allowed myself to compare myself to others and to believe that I am doing it all wrong, and within this to not see the point that it is ultimately irrelevant whether the points that I face are easy for other beings or whether other beings have already made progress in transcending what I am still walking and facing because the relevant point is that I walk my process no matter what, because I am the only being able to walk my process - thus I do not allow myself to use the process of others as comparisons.

I forgive myself that I have accepted and allowed myself to allow backchat and spitefulness and jealousy toward other beings whom I have believed and perceived to 'have it all going right' and appear to me within my perception to have 'better lives' and 'better relationships' when I am actually projecting onto the other beings what I see in my life would be better if I were to transcend and remove the points of limitation that I see within myself and to become angry at myself for having accepted these limitations in the first place, or have already transcended what I experience difficulty with in terms of my own process.

I forgive myself that I have accepted and allowed myself to believe that because the tools and practical steps of process are the same for everyone, then it means that they somehow 'got through it' and are 'better' than me because I apparently haven't been able to 'get through' that specific point, again not realizing here the specificity of our process in terms of the individual time-lines, relationships, and accumulations that each must walk which are multi-dimensional in nature and cannot be compared within a point-to-point basis according to my own definitions within my own mind, based on my own points of self-reference.

I forgive myself that I have accepted and allowed myself to diminish myself and trap myself within comparing myself to others and becoming frustrated when I perceive and believe that another being has transcended a certain point or have developed a certain skill or ability, to develop and express as me, that which I allowed myself to separate myself from in the first place.

New to this subreddit and find it encouraging!  

I'm hoping that if I describe my feelings others might be able to help me to correctly process my emotions.  
As a teenager
Now I finally myself out of college, losing weight (20+ pounds in recent months!).  I definitely look better and feel better, but emotionally something's just 'not right'.   

I'm bitter over my lost faith and my sexual inexperience.  I feel anger and sadness when I see others in relationships, kissing, loving, etc.  It's like there's a giant ""be loved by someone"" ship that left without me on it, and I'm desperately treading water to catch up - ""Wait For Me!"" (Or - somebody please Notice Me!)  
 
Has anyone felt this way and now has a happy story to tell?  And any tips on how I should process these negative emotions? ",,t5_2qho7,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/l5rjr/24_m_need_help_processing_feelings_of_rejection/

Editor’s Note: This is a contribution by An Bourmanne

***“And in the end


I used to think that I would motivate myself to really live up to my full potential by reminding myself how much I wasn’t.

Well

Not that I didn’t get any results from chanting “You are so not living up to your full potential!” while getting out of bed, and combing my hair. Any time was a great time to remind myself. So I didn’t waste a second doing just that.

And I got results. Only not the ones I expected.

I became an expert on mindlessly browsing the web. I became an expert on constantly comparing myself to other people. I became an expert on feeling stuck. I became an expert on driving myself crazy with my non-stop “you are so stuck” chatter in my mind.

I felt drained

So it shouldn’t be any wonder I grew less and less fond of my so-called motivational mantra that was doing anything but

I’ve realized that living up to our full potential starts with eliminating three big lies:


**Lie # 1.** It’s productive to beat ourselves up about not living up to our full potential.

When we spend all our energy telling ourselves we’re not doing good enough

Don’t get me wrong

I was very busy searching for my full potential. I read tons of books. I completed lots of quizzes to find my true talents and the right job for me. I browsed the job section of newspapers. I looked at what other people were doing.

In short

I wasn’t paying attention to what gave me energy. I wasn’t paying attention to what fascinated me.  Instead I was writing the pros and cons for potential jobs

I’ve come to believe that we already know what it means to us to lead a rich

And listening to ourselves.

And taking action and checking in with ourselves to discover what feels good, what drains us, and what fascinates us.

It’s a matter of allowing ourselves to explore and experiment, brilliant life that inspires us.


**Lie #2:**  Living up to our full potential means living a life free of fear

I convinced myself that living to my full potential meant living happily ever after

I’ve come to believe that this is a myth.

Living up to our full potential means feeling the fear and doing it anyway. It means realizing we are living up to our full potential because of and thanks to the mistakes we make and what we learn from them.

Living up to our full potential means seeing things as they are

It means allowing ourselves to feel the way we do

It means diving in and exploring why we are feeling the way we do.

And that’s when we find our answers. That’s when we reconnect with our full potential. That’s when we start tapping into our brilliance.


**Lie #3:** We’re not good enough.

When we tell ourselves “You are so not living up to your full potential!” we’re basically telling ourselves “You are not good enough the way you are right now.”

And that is such a disempowering lie.

I’ve learned that it is my choice whether or not to believe that lie. It is my job to let go of that lie and choose an empowering perspective instead.

I’ve learned that I can make that choice every minute of every single day.

So that’s what I did. I made that choice.  And that’s what I do

I’m being the best me I can be

I’ll be thriving tomorrow thanks to the mistakes I am willing to make today.

Living up to our full potential is not trying to avoid making mistakes. It’s giving it our all

I am now reconnecting with my full potential through everything I do.

I choose to explore. I choose to explore me. I choose me.

Living up to my full potential is doing my thing, in my own fabulous, imperfect way.

Some will like it

I’m done living someone else’s life. Living up to my full potential is giving myself permission to be who I am

I feel empowered, playful and inspired; these are just a few of my new daily companions on this long, fascinating, winding road that is living up to my full potential.

And they didn’t come into my life by accident. I choose to invite them in. One empowering thought at a time.

And so can you.

My mother was my main abuser; let's do a quick rundown of her first; (she turned 45 last month)
-7 siblings; six brothers; second youngest
-abandoned by her mom
-was in poverty and whole family lived in an old two-room schoolhouse; was raped at 13
-bipolar and alcoholic
-was sexually promiscuous for most of my life



Let's do a quick rundown on me;
I have two brothers; my full-blood brother is extremely antisocial and does whatever he can to recieve attention
 My parents divorced at 13; they tried when I was 10 but never went through with it. my father is emotionally distant, my mother actively kept me from making friends, stating that she was all I needed. She told me and my brother that she hated us because we were half of our dad and she hates our dad, and if she got worked up enough (which happened whenever she was drunk which was often), she would kick down our doors after we would lock ourselves in our room and drag us out by whatever part she could grab first. She would pin us, punch, kick, my parents would regularly get into fist fights. My mom would injure herself and even did it on front of my brother once, given my past, though) and attempted suicide. I have stopped this. I didn't start dating and lost my virginity to someone I hated at 18; i wanted men to approve of me so I would force men I didn't even like into relationships. In 3 years



so here's what I ask you

1) what do you tell yourself every day

2) Relationship advice. I went through a bit of therapy in the end of last year and I'm doing better, not mentally ill, and better than I am. I want to make us work because he's the first man i've wanted to date but I'm afraid that I'll destroy it. When I'm doing okay, our relationship is fantastic.

Some Background: 

 The marriage ended as a result of the revelation of several lies he told me. This pattern of lies began when we were dating and continued when we were married. I never suspected anything was amiss until one day when I found a secret bank statement. That opened the flood gates. Pretty much everything he had told me about several subjects was untrue. 

There was no infidelity that I am sure of

 I sometimes miss having a partner to do things with but as I failed so miserably to find the right guy, ok to be by myself. When awake, if I happen to think about my ex it is with disdain and I generally send him a silent ""fuck you"". 

The Dreams:

Two nights in a row

Waking Up:

When I wake up, but I can not imagine why that would cause me to dream we were in love after all of this time.

Granted we still spend time together, it made little sense to maintain any contact.

I should also mention that I've never really had a large group of people I spend time with, I notice the feeling of loneliness is only getting worse. Many times have I thought that I should get out more, go on dates, meet people and stop feeling sorry for myself. However, I then remember why I'm so afraid; I hardly have any relationship experience and I'm a virgin. But it's not that simple - my personal regions are quite bent - in fact so bent that when I met my first girlfriend (I was 18) we could not have sex. I even went to a doctor whom recommended surgery (which I had) to correct this, but as the healing progressed my personal area returned to it's previous shape. I had, for other reasons

Then, but once I go to the bathroom, well, it's like a tap that wont quite shut for another hour or so. I'm sure you again can see where this is going. With these issues and an already incredibly shitty self esteem I became even more hesitant to talk to women other than professionally or platonic. Finally, a few years after this happened I got diagnosed with irritable colon. Long story short, constant uneasy/painful feeling in the stomach, always gassy and generally very uncomfortable. Again

In the midst of this I did meet (somehow) another girl which I did get into a form of relationship with, eventually we get into bed together and once again I'm unable to perform. Not because I'm nervous (well okay I was) but because well, bent + slightly slack = not very easy. Soon thereafter she moved back to her home-country which ended the relationship. I did all I could to hide my bodily issues from her and due to her job and the fact that we hadn't been seeing each other for long, I managed quite well (although I think she suspected). Since then I've basically not even tried meeting anyone else. I haven't told anyone about all these problems and I'm not sure what I should do. I don't dare go out dating/whatnot because this will probably come up before there's real trust. Not that I think I'd be laughed at, but honestly, who'd really want to date a guy with that much baggage and no experience?

Finally always being alone and not having any friends whom I trusted for the first ~19 years has led me to consciously avoid any dependence on others. Likewise

I don't know what to do. I thought about things like taking dance classes or similar, I do, it's just that I do it on my own so as to not embarrass myself and pester others. I always tried to tell myself that alone I am strong, and that there's more to the world that relationships, but I don't think it's working anymore. Right now what makes me hang on is that I really don't want to disappoint my parents. Professionally and academically I'm quite successful and I do my best to maintain a facade of mental well being around them (and my friends when I do meet them) but I'm not sure it will work for much longer. I've never told anyone this (my parents know of my physical issues, but they think I'm coping) and I never felt like I've had someone I could have told. I'm not really sure what this will accomplish, but I at least I did write it down. Granted if you have any tips on how you managed to get out of a similar situation I'd love to hear. Again, but I simply don't have the confidence to break out of the spiral myself.

1320430996.0,m0k4d,"Advice needed: How to overcome troll brain and get out of a ""forever alone"" phase.",nullachtfunfzeh,9,0,8,"So here are the facts: 

**I’m 22. 
Not terribly handsome
I dress pretty well and I’m relatively fit. 
I receive good grades and study at a fairly well renowned university.** 

**I wish I was like “Mensa-clever”
I think I have great taste in film
I am quite neutral when it comes to politics and religion

**I am not very good at making people laugh
All in all I would say I am quite balanced.**

Like most men in my situation my main problem is probably lack of self-confidence, like travel alone, going out more and meeting strangers. How much this is related to the anti-depressants I don’t know, but like the name indicates, the main effect has only been to ease my depression. I mostly behave just like I used to. 

Eight months have passed since I broke up with my high school sweetheart. I can’t say I have ever been close to finding a new girl since then. We were together for four years. In total I have been in two relationships. Both the girls I’ve been with took heavy initiative at the beginning

I have however gotten confirmation that I can be “that person” that people seem to categorically appreciate. Even hot girls. When I drink I usually become a bit depressed. But once in a while I experience a boost of self-confidence and sociability. I haven’t really used this surge of social awesomeness to directly hit on a girl, but it’s the same procedure as every year. She seems to need just a few seconds to realize that I am not really “that person” she met at the party. And I can in fact see how that genuine smile in her face quickly fades, to be substituted with a very false one. When I see her today she barely says hello. It’s not a huge loss, as despite of her hotness, she is not really the kind of person I would like to be with, but I think it greatly illustrates my problem with girls. 

Or take this. When I fall in love I am usually so shy and awkward about just speaking to that person that I may end up appearing mildly retarded when I finally do. It’s like my brain keeps saying: “oh my god, but it’s usually not a huge problem to just relax and be oneself among them. Thus, most of the girls I have absolutely no romantic feelings for seem to think I am a great guy. And not all of them are ugly :)

It feels like I am a pioneer in trying to cope with this particular set of problems

Besides I am not really in to ploughing through hot girls in a club until I find someone who is hot and willing. How a girl looks like is important, and I can’t see how that’s going to change in the foreseeable future.  

TLDR: Too shy to talk with girls I am in to. Have tried to do it anyway

This is going to be a bit long

First my story/example.

I was at an Applebees with my mum and little brother, and all around bad about it all. Back to the Applebees tho. They had this jukebox to pay and play your song over the restaurant speakers. I had just put on Radiohead and was looking up something to play next. While leaning up against the machine this cute short redhead girl, she was a waitress there, comes up and asked if I was the one who played Radiohead(because she liked them). I said yeah and suddenly got nervous. I knew I was going to fuck up, I was thinking of what to say and knew no matter what, it was going to be wrong. So put her on the spot instead. I asked if she would like to select the next one, my dime. She said no and sorta just looked at me. 
THIS IS BAD. I just say alright and bail
Sitting there and thinking, could have gotten off your lazy ass... Shut up brain, stop being a dick, I want to meet someone and your not helping!* I hop up, stroll over to Her and lay it on the line. ""Hey I just moved here, I don't know anyone, my name is Lewis btw. Lacy, so you like Radiohead, I would really like to know someone here in town."" Success. 

My point in all this is, you have to say, I want this because I know deep down inside I want it, and there is nothing that is going to stop me from getting it. 

With the whole girl thing/boy thing, hair, bands, anything really. People like to be nice(unless they are dicks) so use it, make it seem like they can help you somehow. Make eye contact, smile, even if you hate it

I don't understand why Im motivated yet I don't do anything about it. I always tell myself Im going to do it but I don't. That leads me to look back at my failure and keep it on my mind and probably being the reason why I don't want to focus on my goals. I can't get over the past 

Not sure if this is important but I also have a ""i don't care"" attitude all the time. For example: I don't care what I wear or how I go to school. Im honest to people regardless if it hurts their feelings

What's wrong with me? What do I do? I don't know .

1372679621.0,1hf6ae,My Story - A brother with paranoid schizophrenia. Help and advice wanted.,Aionarap,9,3,7,"Hi Reddit

My name is Joshua.

I am looking for advice or useful coping mechanisms for myself and my family where my older brother

The story.....

James is 32 and has suffered from the illness since the age of about 18. The catalyst for his downwards spiral was marijuana and possibly other drugs he was exposed to (in the later years of school) and unfortunately had a pre disposition to. My parents had James taken to hospital against his will after a series of progressively worse episodes which endangered himself, however he soon healed with the help of medication and psychiatric sessions - Though the resentment to Dad for the forced admission to hospital is something he has held on to for the last 14 years - 

He continued to take the medication

Throughout the medicated years, he purchased his own house, and built up an inventory of belongings. All while on medication.

During Jame's 'good' years, the three younger kids always got along better and had more in common with each other than we did with Jame's, and because of that, he felt like an outcast in the family and has always maintain the distance and maturity of the 'older sibling' that should set good examples. My immediate family has always looked after each other, and put each other first, before friends, work and travel, we're closer to each other than to anyone else

One morning, even though he felt he was capable of it. 

So he stopped taking the medication...

This was the beginning of a 5 year decline in Jame's thinking and rationality, family. 

When James decided to stop taking his medication, and his friends and family all conspiring against him to his detriment. Because of his increasing paranoia and strange behaviour, he became the target of bullying at work, which escalated to his being asked to resign. This was closely followed by a decision to sell his house, with enormous and unnecessary financial loss. This lead to multiple rental places in which James always found various irrational reasons to move away from, and although he had been intermittently coming back to the family home and staying just long enough to ""hate all the noise and commotion"" (of two 60 year old parents), he  finally settled in to the granny flat on the family property

Since James has had his own space in the granny flat, and keeps the building locked up and curtains shut at all time. He has grown unhealthy and increasingly strange. All attempts at a conversation with him are now lost, for myself, my siblings (who all moved away from home due to his eery and frighting presence) and my parents. He speaks to him self, argues and yells, breaks a lot of things around home, and commits other strange acts like damaging other peoples belongings around the house

The family has made multiple attempts at individual (low pressure) talks as well as full family intervention talks. James has agreed at times that he is in a bit of a 'bad spot' but won't come close to admitting he has any sort of illness and always relates it back to 'tough times in the economy and hard to find work' etc.

We have tried to approach him about study options, but without admitting he has an illness he is not moving forward  at all. We have had visits from psychiatrists and social workers who have stated that without Jame's willingness, there is no way we can force him in to 'protective help' again as he is now an adult and has full human rights as stated by the law here in Australia.

We have been told that until we can prove in a court of law that he has hurt himself or another person, a head psychiatrist has advised us that 'if James was to commit a crime in his current state, he would not be charged, on account of his illness...? I don't understand how these two scenarios can coexist....

Unfortunately in my eyes, versus the health of my parents and my family, that are being torn apart more and more each passing day at a seemingly impossible situation. My parents have been married for over 40 years, and I have seen them fight twice, ever. Both in the last two years, both about James. Mum is the 'in denial overly protective mother who just wants to see James safe and at least she can ensure that in her own home' type of person, while dad is the 'we won't be around much longer and don't have the energy to keep fighting an impossible cause and have to get James help and independence' type of person. Mum, rather than the denial she showed in earlier years.

At age 62 and 64, while Dad tries to teach english, law and order to refugees that have floated to our country on rafts. They work so hard to make ends meet looking after them selves, their son and their future and yet little happiness or comfort.

For each month that passes, wasting out their days on a useless cause that will haunt them, and eventually move on to haunt us kids once they are no longer around. I know this is a huge fear of theirs. I live my life each day, waiting for a phone call from my parents or a sibling telling me that something horrible has happened, something that I know I will believe was avoidable if action could have been taken sooner.

I am 23, while my other brother, Sam sits in a respected position at a large ISP. All three of us have moved away from home to gain distance from the issue and begin to live our own lives. However it's not possible for us to live happily knowing what our parents come home to every night.

First off, and that my friend, is amazing. 
Now to maintain these healthy habits, your motivation to accomplish your goals and your ability to grow. So next time you’re not feeling “natural” or “present”, follow these steps. First of all, breathe, try to relax and get a grasp on reality. When you do this you realize that you’re not in your natural calm state and you need to take action. Secondly, you need something to get your mind off of what you’re feeling for an extended period of time so the bad emotion can fade away. I call these distractions, and they can be anything that will divert you from your negative mental state so a new, can take its place. You could exercise, read a book, think positively throughout the whole process. Your thoughts are the main source of your emotional state and are responsible for maintaining healthy moods.

I lost contact with my friends from university. Most of them got girlfriends and since I didn't have a  girlfriend I was pretty much left out of their circle of friends. And usually I was always influenced by them. I don't know if I really had these kind of problems but I started hearing all sorts of things from them like I was too quiet or I wasn't wild enough. 

This points out to another problem. I haven't been able to find a girl friend. I find I t harder and harder to get attached to someone. I have a pretty unusual job, but to me having a job and doing something social is a tiring effort. Maybe I am not used to this, I am still pretty new to my job.

In the end it points out to a core problem: getting emotionally connected to people. When I was younger I could easily talk with people and understand how they feel or in what situation they are in so I could easily respond to that. Now for some reason everything moves to fast that I can't understand anything. This is just one of the reasons. I am harder to impress

A lot of my friends go out in clubs but I can't really take any fun in that. Or maybe I go out with the wrong type of people? Or I should do other things.

Heck I hardly remember how this time passed by and all the memories that I have made. I mean I did a lot of things but somehow I always got the impression that I was forced to do them and I never really enjoyed them.

This doesn't affect my relationships with girls but with other people. How  can I get my life back? I am 23 years old and I feel like 40 or 50 inside. I still want to keep my job. Maybe I was having just a hard time getting used to my job.

Let me start off by saying that I am 18. I just got out of high school

Anyway

About five years ago, shy, and a general peach to be around. I had a big crush on her, and I called her all the time just to talk to her. We were pretty good friends...well, I thought so, anyway. (In truth, I bugged her a lot.)

Ninth grade rolls along. She gets with this other guy. We are still friends, she and I just...drift apart; she goes her way, to her friends and to her life, and I go my way, to wherever the hell the winds take me. 

By the time tenth grade was over

At that point, why was there no closure? Where was the movie-esque letter in the mail that describes her feelings? But I had to settle with a bad taste in my mouth and regret in my heart...

...until a chance situation required me to be in a car with her.

She was driving me home. I couldn't drive yet - I was still taking classes for driving. She stared forward

So I broke the ice with a story. 

I don't remember what I told her. I was so nervous from trying not to say the wrong thing that I had to force myself to think of nothing but the story. But the basis of it was the fact that I knew I fucked up. I had expected too much from her

I kept going on and on until I couldn't go anymore. Then I asked her to park in a parking lot. When she did

The next two hours boil down to her basically saying that she used me as an emotional punching bag at the last week of our friendship. She knew I could take it. At the time, we had a time.

Fast forward to summer - two weeks ago, like usual, she is snarky and rude to me. But something is different. She is really laying it on thick. Probably due to the fact that I was being my old dumb self, and was depressed from a previous encounter with another girl.

""Why do you even text me if you know I will react like this?""

At that point

No matter how much I tried, the girl shunned me. This was going nowhere, and the only thing I would get out of trying to be her friend again would be a broken heart and a hatred of women.

I really like that it's a part-time job (so that I can have a life) and that I'm almost completely free to determine my schedule. I can come and go as I please but I have to do X hours a week. And I can't do it.

Every time I aim for X hours, or wake up late (dear god waking up...) or any other unrelated shit. I myself am tired of it and I can see management is none too happy about repeating the same reminders almost weekly. I guess the only reason I haven't lost my job yet is because I'm an okay salesman.

I’m not sure where else to post this but if there is a more appropriate sub-reddit please direct me to it.

I have recently been wondering if I may have some sort of mental problem

 What has led me to this idea:

 I am an extreme perfectionist, Harpist.)  
During the summer (during the school year I only practice 3 hours a day)

 I’ve had this image in my head of what the perfect young woman is to look and act like
It has always been: Slender with long fair hair, Demure, and a very good classical singer (I added this around the age of  10 years old because I saw the Broadway show “Phantom of The Opera” And got very into actual Opera. )
I worked at it for years and years and now I seem to have obtained these things, but it has made me incredibly vain and doesn’t seem very normal, Is it? And I wonder if I am not truly being who I am but I am also not sure who else I could be. 

I do not like the company of other people, the only reason I obtain friends is so that my parents do not worry about me. However, I often lose them after a time because I only speak and talk to them when I feel it is necessary but the only reason I even go out with friends at all is to reassure my parents that I do have them and also to be able to wear my nice clothing (I come from a semi- wealthy family and collect vintage and vintage replica clothing) in public. This seems very selfish and kind of narcissistic doesn’t it? I do not think this is how most people act but I’m still not sure. 

 I am very concerned with my appearance, until recently(Fall of 2011)  I would very often cut myself  very deeply in my legs and I have huge scars now as evidence of this behavior, on occasion I would burn myself as well.  

Some of my history that might have led to mental problems: 
I lost my virginity at age 12 and continued to behave wantonly and have sex with both genders until I turned 14 ½ (I am 17 now and have been celibate for 2 ½ years.)  

At 11 years old I began drinking and then at the end of my 13th year I started smoking marijuana and taking drugs such as Acid and Psilocybin mushrooms but I stopped all this at 15 and now I will not so much as drink alcohol and I am vehemently opposed to drugs for myself (I don’t much care what others do.) 

From the age of eight until about eleven years old I was bullied very harshly by my next-door neighboor (Also a girl surprisingly) who forced me to do some disgusting things but only on occassion. 

When I was very young (only about 9 or 10) I would get on the internet and watch shock films

Because of my past experiences and strange personality

Basically

I used to not really care much for anything that didn't have to do with my own life (Geography, Literature, etc.) and as a result wasn't very absorbent throughout my high school career. But since maturing into the person I am now, I have taken a much greater interest in just about everything. I've been consistently reading more, taking interest and actually receiving what's being taught in school, wondering about the outside world, looking into current affairs, don't get me wrong

My dilemma comes into place as I address my current level of general education. It is very limited. Because of my ignorance in the past, and actually acquiring this past knowledge? I'm talking about staple historic events, geographical locations, etc, etc. Are there general knowledge websites/books/games/etc I should be investing my time in? Are there courses I can take? List of readings? As it stands, if I hear about something I am unfamiliar with, I educate myself on it. And this is great for me. But what I really need is a way to familiarize myself with the key things someone of my education level should know.

Now I am in university reading a subject I originally loved. The course is 4 years long. I passed 1st year by a hair's breadth (I forgot to mention I am somewhat intelligent so this was a surprise, repeated and passed. I failed 3rd year, repeated and passed [**expensive**]. Both of these failures caused significant hardship to my parents perhaps because I am the eldest and they may be afraid I am setting a poor example but after all the fighting and rage they always say that they love me no matter what and they'll do anything for me and I promise to try harder and that I love them too.

Now I am in my final year and, in which I failed by procrastinating my work to the point of oblivion, here I sit with just over a month to deadline with zero work done on my final year project. 

I said that I originally loved my subject but from the failures

Now I don't expect reddit to wave a magic wand and save me from whatever fate awaits me (probably an eternity of fire and brimstone - which incidentally I couldn't fault as a just punishment if this was someone else I was talking about).

I know that this is harmful to me (as is our friendship at times), but I can't help it - he still has a big place in my heart and I want him in my life, even just on a friendship level.

I moved home &amp; am no longer in therapy (hoping to find someone new soon) and I feel, or know, that I have fallen off the wagon big time.  I have been having a lot of fun (more drinking, which I know I need to be mindful of), but I feel like I was on a very positive path, and I am now really disappointed in myself and don't know how to move forward.

I met a guy who I knew to be in a relationship.  I was interested in him, especially since I had just learned of my ex's new relationship).  We were drinking one night and we slept together.  I also really opened up to him about my life.  We have been together several more times over the last month, and after I always feel terrible, but in the moment it makes sense to me.  I know that what I am doing is wrong and that his girlfriend deserves so much better than this.  I am going to put an end to it with him, tell him that it's getting too intense and that I feel it is wrong to continue.

AT ALL.

On top of that

I'm just really struggling because I know that actions speak so much louder than intentions or the narratives we tell about ourselves.  I know that I am not this person.  I don't think I am a good person, any guy - my ex included, to validate me or to show me my worth.  I just miss him a lot.  And I am so disappointed in dragging someone else into my shit by being with this other guy.  And I am so afraid that if I do what I did earlier this year to ""be okay"", that I will lose the friends I have started to make and be alone and depressed again.

I don't really even understand what's going on with me. I have ADHD (I was diagnosed as an adult

All I've been doing lately is playing WoW, I haven't screwed that up yet. I'm currently looking for a another job as well, but not really. I have trouble even motivating myself to take a shower everyday. The laundry is piled up, my apartment is a disaster. I just don't care. Well, that's not true, I do care. 

I feel like I'm wrapped up in a straight-jacket of apathy. But, I'm screaming to get out. I have to actively argue with myself sometimes, when my mind starts to despair. I have to tell myself that 'I can do it', etc. I'm just stuck.

I feel isolated as well. I don't have any best friends. I'm not even sure how that happened. I have a dozen or so friends that I hang out with every week or two, be it a SO or a best friend or whatever. I don't have that. I feel like no one really relates to me. My friends all seem to love having me around, I'm very funny, and I know I'm entertaining to them, and I do think that on some level they genuinely care, but I just feel like an alien to them some times. 

I am fairly certain that my situation has everything to do with my ADHD. I'm on medication

My life is plagued by inconsistency, lack of purpose, and the fog of an unclear and frustrated mind. The only time I feel normal is when I'm drunk, or immersed in WoW, anything to distract me from all of the goals that I have failed to reach.

Celexa was an excellent part of my recovery that helped fix the pattern of up/down, workaholics, sex addicts, etc .)

Well, what was missing and what was needed to thrive.

Now 8 years later I have come so far I can't even believe it sometimes.  I often get mired in day to day drama and forget how much progress I've made in my personality, my dread, my life, my confidence and especially my relationship to my inner child.

And all of that possible with the help from a tiny little pill that held my serotonin in when I just wanted to dump it out all at once.  

Withdrawal is hard, neck/back pain, dizziness, vertigo and many others but also a profound reawakening of my sadness and my relationship to my emotions.  I had forgotten how lovely poetry can be and how much I could feel and express but also what it feels like to do  a lot of crying and some downright sobbing.

But my work over the last 8 years is holding and while extremely sad right now I am compensating with my newfound areas of recovery (exercise, meditation, sleep and fun) and making sure I keep things in proper perspective.  I know that I will be fine.  My little guy inside knows I will be fine and together we are coping and actually enjoying this emotional reawakening.

So…I j ust want to say thank you to my little buddy:  I took you for granted and never understood so fully what you were shielding me from.  Now that you're gone I promise I will keep working hard to fill myself in the right way so that all your good work will not be for naught.

The realization came to me when I was thinking back on how I talked about one girl in a completely despicable manner. About this girl, I've really began to dislike and become mentally critical of her for her ignorance of the real world including my feelings for her. And to top off these mean and hypocritical thoughts, I come back to the event which gave me my realization. I described things I'd do to her during sex, more like as an object than a person. At the time, I was excited and with friends, talking about girls we thought were attractive and whatnot. But when I got home, she chatted me, I thought back to what I had said about her and experienced some of the worst feelings of guilt I've ever had. I couldn't believe I had subjected her to such thoughts, I was a bad person. 

The realization got much worse when I started thinking about all the other people I've been a total ass to. In summary, or subjected to bad thoughts. But this wasn't what was important, what became immediate to me was that I have to change. I don't want to be this kind of person to others. I want people around me to be happy and have complete trust in my thoughts and feelings towards them as I can never seem to have towards others in fear of what they might think about me. I just don't want to be as much of a shithead in my adult years as I am now. 

I'm not really sure what to ask. But I would really like some advice on how to make myself better about respecting others. I don't want to become angry at others, lifestyles, and preferences that I should respect, and even appreciate. I can't believe it took me this long to realize how important other people are, as opposed to how important my own feelings are. So how can I help myself reach this goal of empathy and respect? I know simply becoming more respectful towards other people is the simple answer, but there must be more to becoming a better person. I'm almost tempted to contact the people I've wronged in the past, and tell them I'm sorry, and don't even know if it's such a good idea...

The pain and suffering we all inevitably experience in our internal worlds comes almost solely from how we define ourselves in answering the question ""what is my identity"".  In a grossly materialistic position, which society largely looks down upon this form of identifying, correctly labeling it materialistic. But in less overt ways we also identify with relationships and roles of behavior, and in very subtle ways we identify with feelings, emotions and neurosis. Often throwing in ""Oh that's just me"" in response to our inability to shake them.  But we are none of those things, they are all simply *things*. They are a part of our experience and occupy our attention but in actual fact we are the *attention* not the experience, we are the *witness* to the experience of these things. The experience is simply so overwhelming that without paying careful attention *to our attention* we get caught up and entangled in the experience

Once we start to pay attention to the subtle things in life which are holding us back, in true western warlike fashion. ""This is wrong, lets correct it and it will be right."" 

The biggest lesson I've learned is that these parts of our experience that get highlighted by introspection are not blocks but in fact the doorways to our healing. Ironically, creating space for these experiences to exist as they are and sit with them, learning to become comfortable with the uncertainty they bring, they can become powerful tools for us to discover who we are. Due to our identification with them, they become are our 'edges', the fuzzy ground where we're not comfortable or confident, because where we would like to see solid wall defining the boundary of our being, scary

This act of 'sitting with' things is actually a kind of meditation, label, remove, etc. After enough time, we realise that we are not these things that bother us, they are simply an experience that we are going through, who we are is actually in the position of the witness of these things, there is an internal transition that slowly occurs, begins to land: *If i can observe this thing

So there is no escaping to the hills on offer here by withdrawing our attachment to things

So you've got problems, things you want to deal with. Well the absolute first step is to create internal space. A distinction between the world we exist in, and our internal position as the experiencer of the world we exist in.  This is challenging because so much of our worldly experience *feels* internal, but is actually not. When I say internal I am referring to the deep internal witness, *no thing*.. there is no way for language to put a finger on what I'm referring to here. It is in our nature to want to be able to point definitively to things, but in this realm it cannot happen, we can only hint at it. This is why the practice of meditation is so necessary

As the shift of identity occurs, is that it is our resistance to things which give them their form, once we remove our resistance they cease to have any power over us, so they can simply be.

1348797903.0,10lj73,I'm 28. Girl. And I need help.,nakedcrumb,9,3,7,"Hello

I just turned 28 a few weeks ago and I feel like my life is falling apart. Almost everyday

I have sought help for depression and anxiety and everything else in the world. I have all the tools but I am not using them. I am hitting rock bottom. 

I have a job, I don't know how to get it. 

To be specific, paxil etc.) After finding out that my moods are triggered by a hormone inbalance, I sought help for that. I have food plans and supplements. I have 8 or so years of tireless fighting under my belt to curtail personallity swings, a poor childhood and a real, chemical issue. 

Instead of grabbing the day by the balls

I need to break up with my boyfriend and it is causing me more anxiety than I can handle. I have shut down for weeks now. I don't want to hurt him, the worse I feel because he's not doing a good job. He didn't celebrate my birthday, and has gotten anti-social and weird every time we go out and try to do something. Then that same evening he'll tell me oh man I acted stupid - let me make it it up to you.

I am so smart and could be so pretty if I lost some weight

I am running from everything all of my problems. Im am choking up just writing this because no one knows how I feel. I don't want to burden friends and family with this because I'll just let them down when two weeks from now

My hormones are so wild that I never know how I'll feel when I wake up the next day. I was on birth= control to try and regulate them

I am so stuck. I want to give up. Is there any one that can relate? What did you do?

I have no degree

What I want out of life - Vivaciousness, tour. I want love that bring me up because that is the kind of love I give. I am funny and I want laughter. But I am clinging on to what I have just so it isn't all gone, so I am not all alone and so I don't feel like no one cares.

Is there anything? What can I do? What will change this? Anything will help. Thanks

After a treacherous 4 yrs of being with someone who made me feel like a worthless human being
I didn't realize it in the beginning
Around the end of January
Around that same time I decided to up the game by joining the gym. I felt like I was on top of the world. I was on the right path to becoming the healthiest I've ever been in my entire life and spending time with someone who made me feel worthy.
After seeing that I could reach 200, I started to count my calories. I put myself on a 1200 calorie diet and when that seemed like ""too much"" 1000 sounded even better. I was going to the gym for up to 3 hours a day. I wasn't sleeping very well, very constipated (for up to a week) and having horrible nightmares. I started to feel on edge and as others would say ""moody"". I would hear friends/coworkers joking that I eat like ""a bird"" and it would set me off. I hated being watched. I felt like I was bettering my health. It got to the point where I knew I had to see a doctor because I was having horrible stomach pains. What I thought would be a quick urgent care trip ended me up in the hospital. My HR was dangerously low (39BPM). After my 24 hr stay (I was 170 around then) in the hospital they came to the conclusion that since I was a very active person I had a form of Bradycardia.
After that stay in the hospital I was afraid of damaging my heart by overly exercising so I decided to kick back on my gym sessions. 
I started to feel ""fat"" and felt disgusted with myself and that I was gaining weight if I skipped out on a workout session. Because of fear of getting back to the way I was before
I ended up becoming friends with someone who struggles with bulimia as well and I think the trigger that made me want to care about myself more was a conversation we had one night. After I had said ""I do want to get better. My biggest fear is being found over a toilet of vomit because my heart couldn't take it anymore"" and her response was ""Not me. I don't care. If that's the way I die, I felt if I told them my secret I wouldn't be tempted to do it because I felt embarassed or that they would know that I had purged my food. 
There was a while where I hadn't done it for up to a month or so (and that was really good for me). I decided to get back into my gym routine because not only did it make me healthier it was also my destressing activity. 
My boyfriend is on a ketogen diet. He's been very successful and has lost 31 lbs in about a month in a half. I'm happy for him for the most part, disgusting, slob...""how could she have an eating disorder?""

This has hampered relationships with family

After having surgeries to fix my facial deformity I developed a drug problems that I still havent been able to shake. NA just doesnt work for me. I am not a fan of group therapy nor god things.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**So I was really busy last week

Last week, even though I couldn't really relate with his problems. I felt like I knew how he felt. I guess, just the way he wrote was so real, and truthful. Maybe it's because I felt that there is no way someone NOT in a deep emotional state could write like that. It just really hit me. Anyways, sometime last week, I had an unrecorded Real Talk with Moneypower. Unrecorded because, even though I knew I kind of wanted to talk to him about my introspection; I wasn't sure if the conversation would lead there. Not to mention

I had joined him on Skype to talk about some girls in my life. I did, there was a still a piece of me that wasn't. Even now, I can't thank him enough, but he finally unlocked that for me. It was honestly, the most emotional thing I had felt in a long fucking time.

That night I wrote this after the RT:

***I feel so clear headed right now. Like a huge burden has been lifted off me. As usual on /r/pickup, almost every day since I've found and joined the subreddit. I was always very introverted, and never said much. Tonight I realized that I speak a million miles per hour, and say everything that comes to mind, not letting other people speak until my thoughts are done. Which to many, may seem overwhelming, and may be why not everyone I interact with in the field likes me. That is too much for some people, and let me pour my heart out; letting me speak nonstop. He knew I just needed to let it out. After this

***Just looked in the mirror, the same, but in a different way. Like, the child me, but in the adult form. As I wrote that last sentence, I felt so much emotion rush over me, and almost burst into tears. My eyes are watery. As if that is what I've been trying to bring out for the longest. Child me, not held back my societies pressures, but KNOW I feel comfortable. Now my watery eyes let out a tear. This continues to build, next time I go out

I love how far I've come since I've found /r/pickup, I just want to say thanks Money, for helping me unlock a part of myself that I had lost for so long.

My problem is that I view my self-worth as a comparison of everyone else around me. Basically, and experience.

My major is comp sci and I'm struggling to get by. I study really really hard and do understand the material, I compare my bad grades with their As and just fall into a pit of depression and my thought process ultimately leads to ""Why are you so useless?"" ""You should just end it now?"" I work as hard as I can for this class, but I just can't do tests and they decide my grade.

Another thing that I do is compare my experiences to other people. Oh you're an intern at so-and-so? Oh, don't I? I am constantly measuring where I am in life by comparing myself to other people, which leads to my fear of being left behind. I also get depressed because of this. I want to do so many things like clubs and a job, but realistically, I can't. I even compare myself to my younger sibling who is a freshman in my school. She's meeting so many more people, being more active, and is more responsible and put together than I am. My parents constantly ask me why I'm not as involved as her, but they still think I need to be more active

As a reality check, it is becoming nauseating.

I am also aware that whenever someone questions my ability or nature I am no longer phased like before

I suspect I may still have lingering doubts with my own ability but it was not always like this. There is an event I can strongly recall at the moment that happened fairly recently, and it happened that I was confronted by my peers in a very direct manner on one of my nuances. ie. Why I never let friends over to my place.

Now I realize this sounds like a simple question but I was torn apart during that conversation. It went from I was hiding something to not trusting them as 'friends' to pointing out flaws in my personality. One of the participants went to the extent of citing I was a narcicist and a victim of the Dunning-Kruger effect. The last bit impacted me most because prior to seeing the article

Hence the nature of this post. I'm wondering if my irritation is towards insecure people are normal or could it actually be coming from some deep seated issues (such as what i listed) that needs to be resolved. Any ideas how I can deal with this?

TLDR; Is it normal for someone who is sure of himself to be irritated whenever others behave insecurely?

Update and Edit:

Hi guys, I don't observe it in their normal behavior, or even when I do, it doesn't bother me. The times these behaviors bother me is when they are directed at me in one way or another. 

Examples are such as when a colleague comes and passive aggressively tells me about a story draft I'd written that it's not up to the standards of some famous film, this got me worked up and my line of questioning became more aggressive in nature.

Another example is an ex-classmate who developed a habit of calling me degrading names which I felt was somewhat out of place given there was some distance in our relationship with one another. This only happened whenever she was in the presence of a particular friend. In her actions, I let these comments slide, but deep down they do trouble me as I do not know where exactly this passive aggressive behavior is extending from.

Again I need to emphasize that most times,False,,t5_2qho7,True,,,t3_joqmx

Furthermore, despite how naive it might seem, is actually a reflection of my poor awareness of how it works.

Recently, I am ""probably"" part of a group. I say this with hesitance,  My friends like having me around and do call me to a good share of the times we hang out. However, I know that the inter-communication that happens between them is far greater than me with them.

Some of my reasons why this bothers me is:

* I feel I'm treated as a sort of general lurker who they like being with

* I never get to hear the very personal stories

* I rarely sms them

* Least to say

* I'm also extremely uncomfortable with women and have never been in a relationship and don't have very close girl friends who I communicate often with.

So the help I'm looking for is some sort of template to figure out how to be part of a group , what do they sms about,  how often should you hang out with these friends in a day, and if you're sincerely busy, do you still msg or something .. I hope someone has a clue what I'm trying to get at..

my question is hard to convey in a diplomatic way

I feel that a large cause of my lack of motivation/discipline is caused by the fact that I am ""good enough"" or maybe ""too good"".  A part of me wants to be better

To understand this issue

At school I noticed that I can do homework in one subject while (if!) my teacher checks for done homework at every single desk (due to the desk layout). In other subjects I exploited the fact that very good grades in previous years made it way too easy to convince the teacher that I should continue to get good grades without actually participating that much. In general I noticed that some students really work hard to get the best grade

At university I had to learn for exams, I just worked hard on the parts that were fun and pushed myself to somehow do the remaining work.

In my work life I also never really failed at something

Right now I am looking for another job (as the first job is designed to be only part of my career and my employer also knows that). I already have my first job offer

My story (prepare for a short novel): 

I grew up poor, but usually knew more than what the curriculum thought I should. I spent most of my time at the library or seeking new things to learn, finding new ways to interact with the world and understand it. As time went on, I dropped out of school in 8th grade and decided I'd be better off learning on my own. At age 16 I earned my High School Diploma through a state other than my home, but couldn't go on to college just yet because I was still financially hurting. At age 18, 2009, I was fortunate to meet a nice family who helped me find a way to get to college at no cost to myself. I was ecstatic, the second, lost both jobs I was working (each because of the other), even though I KNEW if I didn't I'd be dropped from financial aid and probably lose any chance of getting back into school from there. 

Between 2010 to just about 4 or 5 months ago, I was homeless. Even still, I was able to find stability for a couple months here or there, and currently am living with my significant other and their family. Even with this (albeit temporary) stability, I find myself always tired, easily drained, in many forms of pain

Some detail should be given about my passion and current 'tasks at hand' as it were. When I was younger, then work out how to put them back together. In my preadolescence, I developed a keener interest in electronics and mechanics, as well as language and many other topics. It was then that I decided I will always aspire to be a true renaissance man. In 2008 my interest in computers and electronics had sparked larger than ever and I started on my way to becoming a technical guru as well as continued my pursuit of becoming a renaissance man.  Now, here in 2013, I have a reasonable level of experience, enough to land any IT or System Administrator job, is myself. As I said prior, I need to clean and organize

I don't know exactly how I got here

**TL;DR: Always been a self driven person: self educated, lately I have lost this about me and am having trouble getting back. Constantly tired/drained/sore/sluggish, even my thoughts have been slowed. I wish to get my deep motivation back.**

1369627331.0,1f4avt,I hate spending my money.,nenuz,8,3,19,"I'm posting this in hopes of getting some advice about my relationship with money.  

I save approximately 75%-80% of my income.  The main things I spend my money on are necessities, and medicine.  I more or less see this as an annoyance, but I know that if I don't spend this money I'll be worse off.  The reason is simple, it cuts into my potential to save more money.

When it comes to personal entertainment or something

The largest purchases I've ever made are my computers (Most of my free time is spent on my PC) and my tools for work (Necessity).  These purchases are often years apart so it's not that bad.  In general

The main issue comes with big purchases I know I will need to make in the future.  A car is a great example.  I know I could buy a brand new car

I **always** want the perfect thing even though I know that's impossible.  If a car could last forever and cost $500, it's a waste.  I've managed to negotiate a few decent deals on cars and other things, but I never go for it because of this feeling.

In a way, food, internet, and other things really bothers me.  All because it cuts into my potential savings.

In the end

Basically, I'm saving for nothing.",,False,,t5_2qho7,False,,

1369331746.0,1ex014,I [18M] am trying to work on some self-image improvements before college starts.,RichardJW,8,2,3,"I've already posted this on /r/relationships


I'm a 18y.o. M who hasn't had the best high school experience. I sort of roamed friend groups throughout my 4 years


This roaming friend-groups thing wasn't all that bad in my mind -- I got to know more people, if that I never really got close with one smaller circle of friends.


I've always been ""that guy who will listen to your problems"", and think a lot when I'm not doing anything.


I've never been in a relationship, I would straight up tell the girl. 


I’ve always been big on being open and honest, but it doesn't really get me down that often. I mean, it’s mostly infatuation, so it wasn't that ""deep"" of a relationship.


The reason I’m posting this is because I’m starting to think that the reason I haven’t been in a relationship yet is because of one of three factors:


1) It’s the people at my high school; it isn’t me


2) It’s me; the way that I treat myself (ie self-deprecating humor, but I don’t really mention it unless they note it.)


3) It’s the way that I act around others, I feel like I’ve already dug myself in that hole.


A part of is deciding against writing this entire thing. I probably sound like the average angst-y teenager. A part of me also wants to try and understand the way that I act


I want to possibly work on some self-improvement things that could help me become a “more than friends” option to people. I’m going to be going to college in a few months

It involves a sort of tension centred in my chest and present throughout my upper body. It can be associated with concerns that the work involved and/or the eventual result would suck

Changes in mood or setting change how often these feelings come up. For some activities

Sometimes, that's very draining and I cannot sustain a lot of that. More importantly, sometimes it seems like the feeling sends an important intuitive message telling me that what I'm doing really isn't a good idea, and I should try something different. The feeling isn't very useful for that though, because it involves a tight focus on what I shouldn't do, instead of creativity about what I should do instead.

Formerly depressed person here with a few tips on getting over life problems.  This mainly applies to people with situations they can get themselves out of.


1. Accept the immoral sides of life.  Not everything you should do is something you should be proud of.  Cutting off friends

2.  Just do it.  Reading about stuff and doing stuff are two totally different activities.  When you hit a lifestyle problem

And let's be honest, meditate, be kind, volunteer, balance a budget, focus on the present, etc. etc.  Whether you consult religion or self-help forums, just constantly make headway every day and you'll do fine.  Reading about making headway and having the 20th guru's blog tell you the same five things that will make your life better is not gonna help.

3.  Stay away from self-help forums.  Okay, these places are pretty depressing.  They can quickly turn into whinefests, where you feel like you need to outdo fellow posters with talking about how sad your life is.  Either that, or you just stand in awe as someone describes a truly horrible life that you could never imagine living in.

When I was a kid, or how to tune into other people.

Another problem was that I was beat up a lot both physically and mentally whenever I cried

That created it's own problems...  I was then faulted for being ""too energetic"" so I grew up hating-hating-hating my own high level of energy.  

In the long run

Being raised in an abusive family means that I had no clue what empathy was. Since no fellow humans ever tuned into me, be my joking, energetic self - and then get inwardly very terrified afterwards that maybe I did something stupid to get rejected and didn't know it.  I've been though the pain of realizing I was the loud bulldozer AGAIN, that I was the subject of talking behind my back for being too outrageous and then hated-hated-hated myself for it.

Also my normal speaking voice is LOUD. Like hurting-others-eardrums loud.   Combine that with the fact that I can't hear my own default voice level

I remember how painful it was to watch polite people who seemed to move with a quiet grace I never had. People who spoke correctly and with the right amount of gentle energy

Only recently has it dawned on me that people who have that quiet grace may have been raised in that strange concept known as a ""loving family."" So being able to have the right energy level and constant sense of personal grace might not be because I am personally defective.  I still feel like a walking cringe

Once in awhile I find people reacting to my impulsive energy as if I was some kind of charismatic, not wanting to ruin it by risking a possibly more depressing interaction with them afterwards.

Inside, VERY sad person.  I have already been through too many incidents where I thought I made a new friend and as soon as I was honest about what I am really about, I never hear from them again.  So I am pretty much alone.

For many years

In the last year or so, I can't afford the good therapist anymore, and she was the best one I've ever had.)

Little did I know then that the more I hated my own energy level

Considering that I have severe PTSD due to the abuse issues, so I am mostly staying by myself now.  

I REALLY wish I could somehow connect my shy/introspective true self with others and have my real inside self be able to have friends.  I don't know... if I open my mouth, I'm alone.  Dammit, I'm alone either way.

I wish I could detect when I am being too loud

I really want to be the quiet

show that life experiences in the domains of love and work are associated with personality trait change.” (p. 7)

""The crux of the process of personality development, expressed in the form of role expectations for appropriate behavior (Sarbin, 1967), set forth by the self and the collective other.... Such role expectations can effect change through either punishing inappropriate behavior or rewarding appropriate behavior.

""The implication of the social investment principle is that investments in conventional social institutions should be related to elevated scores on measures of social dominance, and emotional stability and to increases in these dimensions over time. An important distinction is whether investment is captured in* acquiring the role* or in the psychological qualities of *investing in the role*. It is the latter psychological investments that are more critical, as people can occupy social roles, such as a job or a marriage, yet not be invested in these roles. So, rather than examining whether people are working, what is critical is *how* they are working and the expectations they have for themselves and the expectations that others have for them in these roles."" (p. 9)

(quoted from [this paper](http://internal.psychology.illinois.edu/~broberts/Roberts,%202005.pdf))

**TLDR:** So my takeaway from this is that it backs up some common self-help advice:

Anyway

&gt;As to the top of your post where you talk (a la The Donald) about doing what you love
&gt;1. What they love to do has inherent economic value.
&gt;2. What they love to do could have economic value if someone else who understands the value in what they do continually assigns them tasks with value.
&gt;3. What they love to do has no useful economic value.
&gt;
&gt;People in the first group have a clear path. They are not guaranteed success but they can pursue it independently.

&gt;People in the second group depend on effective managers to be successful. They could become millionaires or go from low paying job to low paying job
&gt;
&gt;People in the third group will either do something they don't love or live off the productive output of others.

&gt;Often people in the first group have ""advice"" for people in the other groups. They should STFU.

I think I have major trust issues, or all of the above. I can't help but feel angry or suspicious when my current girlfriend talks to other guys if I'm not there. It sounds so silly writing it down here, but it's definitely a problem. It isn't as bad as it used to be, and I think it's getting better, and I know my current girlfriend wouldn't cheat on me or anything, but my brain seems to always want to think something bad will/is happen(ing) and I feel suspicious for no good reason.  
  
For example, but it makes me so mad and I can't help but think of all the ""what ifs'."" What if they exchange numbers, would she tell me if she hung out with him? Is he trying to pick her up? Etc etc.. I've even jokingly made comments about it, and she understands, sort of. She knows about my ex, and knows that I am in this way (to an extent... I try not to make a fuss about things, but if I don't mention it I will dwell on it forever), she loves me
  
What can I do to get over this shit? I feel like it's a major problem and can eventually lead to something unhealthy. I feel like this was caused, but I feel like I've been making a lot of steps toward getting over her, especially recently.  
  
I write this now because I kind of had an issue today
  
I want this to stop. I do feel like I trust my girlfriend, and she does so much for me.

Today I had a wonderful day doing lots of fun stuff with friends and colleagues of mine. But when I got back home I just couldn't sleep. I had realised that what my friend thought of me wasn't real because of all the lies she beleived.

I think that deep down i've always known that i've got some sort of a problem but recent events in my life have convinced me that I need to confront this. A while ago I noticed that no matter what kind of questions people asked me I kept inventing lies on-the-spot for no reason instead of just answering the truth. I also noticed that I kept inveting false explanations when the real reason would have been enough. My life is what it is right now because of those lies. I have lied to my parents

So

I have to admit that what scares me right now is that sooner or later i'm going to have to confront the ppl that I lied to and when it's gonna be my friends it won't be pretty. Some might never forgive me.

Any thoughts reddit ?

Title says it all.  Felt...less than loved

Bounced though a few private schools + home school + lived in a neighborhood with few kids = few friends throughout life

*Examples of neglect :* 

Got use to being let down by dad when I was a kid.  Not sure why/how totally.  Remember he was going to build me a club house and only put the four post in the ground.  I remember looking at the post thinking ""wow this will be cool"".  Then nothing.  Remember being surprised when we *actually* went to a roller coaster park when I was a kid.

Dad was the coach of my baseball team

Dad talked about kicking me out of the house when I was like

When I was teenage ish and the pc was in my room I'd sometimes wake up to dad smoking a cig with his feet on my bed (pc @ the head of the bed...).

Dad forgot to call me for my 30th birthday.

Grandpa (dads side

Grandma (dads side) was kind but not super loving

Try doing family stuff with dad (including his bday) and he's sometimes too distracted with his friends to pay attention to his kids.

Mom was better but not affectionate / caring enough.  She worked nights a lot so dad was the main one on the scene during ""after school hours"". 

Even when I was like, or that i didnt eat certain common foods *at all*. 

**More boring stuff here**

Thinking back dad was actually kinda mean / grumpy / etc.  Though ""I can't blame him"" or some shit.  Hard job, etc.  I don't really remember a lot of growing up, snap shots - I've always had a fairly bad memory for the day to day stuff.

Don't get me wrong

I remember feeling a deep loneliness / sadness / rejection after my first brother was born.  He had asthma and required a lot of special attention.  I was only like 5 so of course I did not understand this.

Grew up with very few friends, when its hard to get out its hard to meet people, when its hard to meet people its hard to go out.

I was a bad kid for attention but it wasn't crazy stuff like burning down houses or killing cats.  I got in trouble a lot pretty much my whole life.  Not so much with the law, and on purpose.  But small stuff like expired registration.  

Been smoking weed nearly every day since I was 18 / 19 ish.

I'm actually pretty attractive / smart / funny but for a long time there i was fucking chicks not as attractive (on my scale).

Use to be jealous / curious / etc about people who had a really set sense of self.

Since I didn't have a lot of friends I didn't see how a lot of other parents interacted with their kids.  But in one case I remember being like ""wow this is like a for real family"".

So I'm all growed up now but I still feel kinda like a kid in some ways.  Fucked up sense of self / self esteem.  Crave attention, and I didn't get as much attention.  So I'm like, super sensitive to neglect now.  For srs.

I can relate a lot to [borderline personality disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder#Signs_and_symptoms).  I don't ""connect"" well with others.

It's usually pretty easy for me to talk about my emotions / history and stuff because I don't feel connected to it.

I know I don't get upset from a lack of things. I'm a senior in high school and I'm on the right track to graduating.

The only little problem that I can even think of is that I'm afraid people don't respect me for who I am or what I'm capable of. I've never hurt anyone or even thought about it but the fact that people were scared of me was comforting. But now people feel the need to almost bully me and verbally assault me. I can't do anything about it because I'm 18 and the people doing it are younger. If I would act out and kick someone's ass I would lose everything I've worked so hard to accomplish and I don't want to resort to that anyways.

Because of all that, though I've worked on it quite a bit and it's not nearly as bad as it used to be.

So here is the thing. I am a software developer. I am good at what I do. I don't have any confidence issues there. I really honestly believe that I am a decent developer. But do I know how to sell that skill? Hell no.

In my interactions with coworkers, but it is [most obvious there](http://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/19jpec/need_advice_on_handling_an_egotripping_coworker/), because I'm starting to feel bad about not standing up for myself and my views, allowing people to bully me and trample over me, and ultimately - not showing my knowledge and my true self.

What actually happens underneath is that I panic. Any kind of confrontation (and sometimes even just a regular conversation) makes my adrenaline spike and my mind shits itself. Especially if the other person is loud and/or aggressive

I'm normally very analytical and can present my case in an email with almost perfect clarity

So my question is...is there anything I can do to remain calm during social interactions? How on earth do I stop panicking? Is there any way I can become more assertive? I know people will probably post /r/howtonotgiveafuck but if only it were that simple... :(",,t5_2qho7,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/19kvn6/i_tend_to_panic_during_social_interactions/

About a year and a half ago I was on a jury in a murder trial. It was a brutal murder of a young woman by another young woman. It was extremely senseless and the Jury was never presented with a motive. Needless to say over 8 days we were presented with 100's of pictures of blood and the victims mutilated body. Ever since this I can't watch murder mysteries or horror flicks.

 I often get scared in my house at night that someone is going to come murder me. I cannot control these emotions and usually they pass quickly but sometimes they send me running through my house to get to locked room. Over time it has gotten much better but every time I hear the news of the recent tragedy in Connecticut my mind gets flooded with horrific images which bring tears to my eyes. 

Last Friday I was walking to a store which was right next to the store where Jenna was murdered and tears just started coming down my face. I think I should talk about this but at the same time I don't want to move past it because these children and other people who have been senselessly murdered like this deserve for us to know the truth about their end no matter how horrifying it is for us

I just wanted to share because the last few days have been very tough. I just wish we didn't have to live with these images in our minds and I wish more people didn't have to meet their end like this.

I also feel very thankful that there are so many people that are willing to spend their entire lives discovering the truth about these crimes. Dealing with the gruesome crime scenes and reviewing the evidence. I used to think of prosecutors as just people that put drug dealers in jail and harassed marijuana smokers but I realize now there is a very dark disturbing side to their jobs. I greatly appreciate that they have taken upon their souls the job of seeking justice for the victims day in and day out. I can't imagine how disturbed their souls must be. I wish I could give them comfort. Anyway,,False,,t5_2qho7,1355803117.0,,True

I feel Lost (But it may be loneliness), I was able to scrape by to graduation and get into a photography school right out of high school. Things were looking up. I got a amazing camera, discovered how artistic and creative I was and was having a great time. However, I always knew that there wasnt that much suppourt (or would it even be company, friends? Just anyone to back me up) throughout my daily life, Family is helpful but I came from a family of engineers, nurses and sailors. so not much in the lines of creativity and photograhpic suppourt. I wasnt able to make that many friends (i assume it was because of my reclusive attitude i built back in school) in the photography school. however I had made a promise to myself that my grades wouldnt drop as hard as I'd done back in highshool, but It never felt like there was suppourt backing me

Fast forward to the end of photo-school (2010), magazines, companys, etc and hear a little word back and start working my way as a professional photographer. but all this time, I know im making contacts, short-term friends, and meeting new people

Skipping ahead some more, reaccuring feelings of lonliness and fear of not being sceen.

Come October 2012, so i start looking to new areas of where i can work, construction, nautical, engineering, welding (pretty much most trades)
luckily i get on the wait list for Welding at my local college (stars january 2013) and a spark of optimisim pops up again.


Next comes late october, sounds, and memories. breaks. the shutter is no longer working and I start freaking out, what happens next, is this the end of my photography career? do i just stop what im doing and go into a completley diffferent direction? all sorts of questions begin racing through my head and i lose it. I begin going on long road trips, out to the wilderness, discovering new places, sounds. but even now i can barely remember what i have seen. the all-too-familar *click* of my shutter still rings in my mind

Its December now. I've been applying to all sorts of jobs (warehouse, dishwasher, carwasher, etc) and to no success of accquireing work. I've been living off my last few dollars, my daily tools: phone, watch, clothes, attitude


This was a quick story of my life up to this point, anywhere that I think I could fit in. One day i could be hard-set on being a carpenter, the next i could be determined to work as a deckhand on a small sailing vessel. 

I feel lost. Lost in the world and with little sense of purpose.
