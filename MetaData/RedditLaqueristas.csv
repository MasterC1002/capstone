I am married to an Indian man, divorced, widowed, or who have run away from home a means to make money and support themselves and any children they have. Many families in the village also send their daughters to the school to learn painting or drawing, and their tuition helps to subsidize the school. 


I have been a very long time lurker on Reddit and have never had an interest in nail art until I found this sub with all of you incredibly talented people on it. I took all of my tools and several polishes to India with me


Well, gradients, and even some basic mixing to create colors she didn't have. She was absolutely enthralled by all the techniques, she never even knew some of them were possible, and she took a lot of notes and saved a lot of links to tutorials (many of which I got from this sub).


My Masi decided to take what she had learned from me (and you guys!) and create a course in nail art at her vocational school. I send her weekly tutorials and pictures, and their work is already being regarded as the most desired and sought-after work in the village. Girls young and old are flocking to the salons and spas where they are working for manicures and nail art, and the salons are already demanding more nail artists from her vocational school.


You guys are making a tangible difference in the world with your art

EDIT: Thank you all for your kind words. There have been a few requests for pictures. I will try to get some pictures of the nail art these students have created, and I don't want to take a chance of having a photograph of them where someone could find it. That being said, I will try to get some nail art photos. Thank you guys again! If any of you have any tutorials or personal nail art that are your favorites, post them here and I will compile an email to my Masi. Think luxurious Indian wedding! Lots of red and gold!",,False,self,1366389499.0,t3_1cnem6

Hey everyone

I saw this sale on Good Morning America this morning and I remember the posts I saw on here about butter (probably because I couldn't figure out why people were putting butter on their nails).

Anyhow

I apologize in advance if this violates any subreddit bylaws or policies.
