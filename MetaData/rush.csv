[And now this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/rush/comments/z6y15/this_subreddit_is_now_text_posts_only/)  Excuse me?  Why is this subreddit becoming a weird dictatorship?  How exactly does Antidote define ""karma whoring""?  And why has he/she seen fit to label our image posts as ""pointless"", or am I merely trying to horde imaginary internet points?  *Only Antidote has the answer!*

Here's my guess: Antidote is kind of a dick.  I run four subreddits,000.  That doesn't make me an expert, but it does give me insight into what it takes to manage active subreddits; which is, not fucking much.  You check the spam filter, help out other redditors from time to time, maybe offer guidance on the direction of the subreddit, from design to content.  But you don't simply hand down a list of don'ts from on high and expect everyone to go merrily along.

Hey Antidote, or the driver of the red barchetta, and less like the Watchmaker, or Apollo, or the cops in their alloy air cars?  If we want to post fucking pictures, it doesn't mean we're trying to horde pretend computer points (and even if we were, so fucking what?).  Stop making arbitrary rules.  Stop telling us what we *can't* do.  Stop being a dick.  Yes, however.  It just makes you responsible.  Responsible to the nearly 3, what are the arrows for if not to let redditors judge their own content?

Let people do what they want, or image links, they'll ignore them (or downvote them).  Let us decide for ourselves what we want.  

Are you the Solar Federation?

Or are you the Starman?

**Edit:**  After some careful thought, and I genuinely feel bad about it.  I'm leaving my post as is, as something of a self reminder what not to do in the future.  Antidote, I'm sorry for being rude.

I went to the Anaheim show over the weekend, Clockwork Angels blew my mind. The album is great, and I've been enjoying it since it came out, but hearing it live? This is music that was written to be played live. The album does it very little justice. Rush is an acquired musical taste, and this album is the most acquired taste within their catalog. You can't enjoy this music fully the first few times you hear it. I cried when they played their show. I was mesmerized, amazed, and just really really happy. I stood around outside the hotel ALL night long singing Rush with some awesome people. This show just tops anything anyone has done musically
This music was not meant to be stuck on your speakers

It's heaven. I have no words to describe it. 

I almost cried when listening to The Garden. And the riff in Seven Cities is so good

This was my first live Rush concert

On the musical side of things, as Neil began the famous intro to YYZ), I ended up really enjoying the extra color the strings added to the song. They were not intrusive, but additive. Kudos to whoever did the arranging on that one.

Lyrics attributed to Neil:

&gt;This is all we care to see /
Madness in the streets /
Talk about a sorry state /
Talk about the heat /
If caught take it easy /
While many take it hard /

&gt;It seems we always play the dealer /
Who holds the winning card /
Someone rise in anger /
Someone raise a voice /
Someone ask a question /
Someone make a choice /
There’s no time to surrender /
No time to rejoice /
We’ve been a long

&gt;Watchful and cool /
We can ride out the hurricane /
Restless and wet /
Pretend to fight again and again /
Steady and strong /
We can learn to clean the earth and sky /
We can learn to laugh and cry /
It’s a long

&gt;Watchful and cool in the heat of a dangerous summer /
It’s been a long
Restless and wet /
With the storm and the sweat of the struggle /
It’s been a long
Steady and strong like the struggle of a long-distance swimmer /
Spirits may sag

&gt;It’s been a long
It’s been a long,,False,,t5_2r4wq,1359680136.0,,True

This was my post for November 29

Nov 29 – I am thankful for my favorite band, the classics, everything you would want from a great band with a long career. However, they deserve a spot in this list not for one show but for a lifetime of great memories.

I discovered them around 1981 when a friend introduced me to their music. They were the first band I really got into because they were the first band whose lyrics really spoke to me in a very personal way, Neil Peart, once said, “Our music is the soundtrack of their &lt;the fan’s&gt; lives…” and he was absolutely correct. My life’s soundtrack is dominated by their music and the bands they influenced. They were my first introduction to progressive rock/metal, of which I have become an ardent fan, especially later in life. In times of sorrow, their music is what saved me. I could put on my headphones, close my eyes and become lost in the images. It was an escape no drug could ever match.

Geddy, thank you for a lifetime of joyful memories. Your music has made me smile when nothing else would. Neil, your book “Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road” was a life changer for me, and it may have even saved it. May you continue to make such wonderful music, and give us such wonderful memories, for so long as you desire.",,,flybynight,

Here's the translation:

Well here we are.

It's been a long road

They've got a nice green room back there.

Thank goodness, flying, whatever.

So here's how it happened:

Tom Sawyer, and Geddy's voice. 

It was a hit!  There was sudden increased fame and attention from the music industry.

After that

We saw our name in lights!

That's me!  That's us!  We'll be in the Hall of Fame!

No you won't!

Why not?

1, 4, 5, 6, 789 gold records?!

That's not good enough!

What

Why?

You're nerds!

Fine.  Fuck it.

Then.  Time passed.  We toured.  We flew

Then one day

Hello?

Hi.

Really?!

Are you kidding?

Thank-you

WE WERE IN!

It was the Hall of Fame

So I got all gussied up

I have a list of people to thank:

All of you

And of course

Ah fuck it

All I'd really like to say to you, Geddy:

It's YOU

Frankly as a guitarist, and I love Lifeson's mid 80s work.  I see him exploring different approaches to guitar, since geddy's keys take a rhythm guitar part that sometimes switches to lead on some tracks, It's cool to me as a guitarist to see how Lifeson handles this.  On tracks Like ""Grand Design"" off Power windows, he manages to work with the huge synth guitar stuff to create a musical aurora of sweet perfection, which somehow, his guitar comes alive through the mix.  I love it.  

I love the 80's rock reggae style on some songs, the keys, everything.  

Don't get me wrong,"" ""The Trees,""  I love the early mid and late rush, I still regard my favorite rush song as ""La Villa Strangiato"" but I don't think the 80's keyboard driven rush era gets the credit it desserves, even by the band.

On ""Beyond the lighted stage"" when they interview Alex he states some stuff about 80s where he had a hard time fitting in and finding his role

I think Peart's lyrical content was at its height during this era as well.  

I guess what I'm trying to get to

I would also say that once the band comes to grips with this era of their library and finally embrases it as good work

Step 2:
Convert the number of the ""humanoid escapee

Step 3:
Now convert this number from decimal into ASCII code. ASCII is a coding scheme based on the alphabet: we're converting numbers into letters

The ""celebrities"" at the event are a hilarious leftover of C-list 90s TV hacks and local news anchors (including the outrageously named weathermen Dallas Raines and Johnny Mountain).  Alan Thicke is there (kind of a dick).  I don't recall another single person

Stand in line at a signing booth before the matches begin, STRUMMING HAND, FUCKING GET HIS MOTHERFUCKING SIGNATURE, mumble something unintelligble, shuffle off with the rest of the nerds, gobsmacked, speechless and probably pissing a little.

Then they start playing tennis.  The ""celebrities"" break up into different teams (sorry, they enter the court, an announcer relieves us all of having to guess who the fuck these huge Hollywood stars are, then introduces the main guest of the event, one Aleksandar Živojinović.  I scream like a girl and embarrass everyone around me.  Others do the same, and fellow Rush addicts nod at each other knowingly from across the stands.  *And then my moment in the sun...*

The opposing team/group/couple serve first.  Alex and his partner crouch as tennis players do, but I do know that's a bad thing.  Before the server could have a second go, in a moment of uncharacteristic genius, and never to be replicated again, I jump up from my bench and yell, ""GOOD JOB, ALEX!! WOOO!!"", brain damaged Rush fan can.

The crowd goes nuts, I tell you.  In his mind, it's a funny thing that's no doubt instantly forgotten.  In my mind, it is the sudden culmination of every dream of being cool at the right time I'd ever had.  Raddest fucking experience ever.

Naturally, still reveling in recent glory, tells the budding adult to shut the fuck up.  Yeah.  It doesn't go so well the second time around, and I think Alex is a bit embarrassed that some jackass kid in the bleachers is hollering at him.  From hero to zero in five minutes flat.  Good job, dipshit.

Anyway, and it felt great.

I took some pics of the show. When I got the email saying that I couldn't take a camera I didn't think about what it meant.

   Great

2. Xanadu
     
   One of the more epic

3. Fly by Night
      
   Roots rock with a bit of proggy goodness thrown in. Very melodic and one of my favorites on bass.

4. Subdivisions
      
   Very revealing song showing our human tendencies. Great guitar here.

5. Cygnus X-1: Books I&amp;II
     
   This would be my favorite if Rush didn't have so many good dang songs. Long story song full of musical texture and emotion. The battle of Heart and Mind!

While these have Rush related themes to them they are not about Rush and prompt no discussion about Rush and as such I am considering removing new submissions that are just an image of a barely Rush related thing.

Feel free to comment on this and lets see if we can't come up with a well defined solution (for example what exactly is a barely Rush related thing.)

Thank you

Edit:

Currently I'm thinking of not changing the submission policy very much but I will of course be monitoring the state of submissions.  If subreddit traffic increases to the point that we're overwhelmed with barely relevant images then I'll consider stricter rules.

As for now the only change I'm going to make is that an image has something related to Rush in it.  So a picture of room number 2112 is acceptable but a picture of your cat that you happened to name 'Cygnus' or 'By-Tor' or whatever is not.

Moving Pictures: was originally a blank wall, who was almost really burned during the photo shoot for the witch picture. Hugh told me that they had to get her very drunk before she agreed to let them throw gas soaked rags by her feet and light them on fire.

Permanent Waves: was done using a photo enlarger, the newspaper's headline was ""Dewey defeats Truman"", but they had to change it and eventually remove it due to some legal bullshit.

and finally, built as a set inside the studio for the photo shoot.

For me, but I don't think it's their best, as it's generally listed. At the very least, Permanent Waves and 2112 are better.

The most underrated, the songs are quite heavy (especially the guitar; Alex is really the star of this album), and Neil's lyrics are, in my opinion, some of his best. I also love Vapor Trails.

Forever dwells in that moment

Hope is what remains to be seen""
