**Things I liked**

- The framerate. Very smooth and something that I can definitely appreciate in games today.

- The soundtrack, but MP really resonates with me. The music was really original and definitely relfects the nature of the Metroid series, especially with the intensity of the music in the final stages of the game. 

- The weapons. Each weapon is unique and very fun to use. I really like the fact that in Metroid games

- The use of visors. This was a huge one-up for the game because there were many situations where using a different visor to defeat and enemy or know the territory was very cleverly done in this game. Also

- The grappling beam. Nothing compares to the fun you can have swinging on this thing haha

- All of the lore. Especially the stuff involving how the Pirates were experimenting on Metroids and Phazon. Made the enemies of the game have a purpose. 

- The Aesthetics. Samus' suit looks awesome all throughout the game

**Things I didn't Like**

- Traveling from place to place. There would be times where it took me a good 15-20 minutes just to figure out how I wanted to get where I wanted. There were some elevators that led to different parts of areas and it confused me half the time.

- The metroids that split into two near the end of the game. I found them to be more of a nuisance than a challenge, only to be interrupted by another one coming from the side and forcing me to get it off by power-ball bombing it. It wasn't until the final boss out of desperation that I discovered that smart bombs can easily kill them in one hit. 

- The phantom chozo in random rooms. I didn't really get why that was and I found it annoying to enter a room and hear the shrieks of them every time. 

It's still an all around great game and I'll definitely be holding on to the game as well as picking up the sequel.  ",self,t5_2rrd6,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Metroid/comments/1d0t7p/so_i_just_finished_metroid_prime/

1355951946.0,154nyz,So I had an idea for the next game's story,MinusTheFire,80,16,30,"I’ve had this idea for a while now

Samus and her ship are captured by the Galactic Federation

While in custody, now they want to reverse engineer a new vaccine which will allow them to readily absorb the X-parasites in the same way that Samus does now.  During the experiment, Samus has flashes of waking memory in which she discovers what the GF’s plan is, and she eventually wakes up in the middle of everything and attempts to fight free of her restraints and make an escape.  This is where the gameplay starts.

You wake up, and fight your way out of the lab to try and find your ship.  You don’t make it very far before a voice comes over your communicator telling you that the Federation has deemed you “too dangerous to be kept alive”, just before you find out that all of your weapons and gadgets have been tampered with and are now under GF remote control (since the weapons were provided by the GF anyways, for the most part).  The idea was to wipe Samus’s memory of everything in her past, except Metroids, as the GF has now realized that the combination of X/Metroid DNA in her system has made her the perfect candidate for the new Mother Brain.  The Federation had planned to turn Samus into a fully-controllable, living drone.

You woke up before they could complete the process, and a countdown begins warning you of the impending destruction of the lab.  Since you have no control over your suit anymore, you begin to uninstall and remove everything that’s under Federation control, all while you’re frantically trying to find a way out of the lab.

After you escape, and slowly discovering that the GF had already embedded you with the ability to control certain types of Metroids.  The central plot would involve an attempt to uncover the Galactic Federation’s plan to some sort of higher authority, would take place on multiple planets and/or space stations, so on and so forth.

I’m sure I’ve hit a few continuity snags here and there, please share them!

The Prime series, but it didn't technically move the story along. Chronologically, Fusion is still the most recent game, and it left the series pretty open-ended for sequels. 

Another (much more important) thing to consider is how the series should evolve from a gameplay standpoint. FPS Metroid has been rolled over

In my opinion, but that ship has sailed. What's next? A Super Metroid reskin a la Donkey Kong Country Returns? Prime 4? Something completely different? We can't dismiss the possibility that Nintendo will simply run with the Other M take on the franchise, completely dripping with PMS.

",9,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Metroid/comments/16qzue/instead_of_beginning_the_game_with_no_power/,"This would need some ace design, but we are talking about Metroid here. Some points:

Bosses: It's typical game convention for bosses to evolve a stronger form and become harder to hurt throughout a game, that would make things more challenging. (Also, Other M did a lot wrong, but the concept of a boss which grows older throughout the game was great, and is one of the few times where that 'stronger form' trope made sense.)

New Areas: This would be the hardest part to work, was guide the player without the player knowing it. As a VERY simple example, you get stuck in a room with only one door and it locks. You KNOW there must be another way out, so you look for it. What if the game quickly established that you would never be locked out of anywhere you had previously been, but you might have to find a NEW way of getting there? Secret walls that even your X-ray visor doesn't see are a common thing in Metroid games. You might only find them if you have to. And this doesn't take into consideration new game mechanics which I haven't thought of, regarding transport.

(Edit: At the beginning you might have a basic 'blueprint' that shows you various connections

The order of downgrade: In Metroid games there's often room to move in regards to which order major upgrades are obtained. What if, or a creature or something. This would keep replayability interesting. On a second play through you could use an alternate method to get somewhere and be able to fight the enemies therein with weapons you didn't have last time.

You could even finally get everything back right at the very end, and you sure as hell would have been made to miss them when they were gone. In fact, the final boss sequence could return all your powerups to you somehow and then need to be good at using them if you wanted to escape the planet before it blows up. Because if there's one thing I know about Metroid, it's that the planet should always blow up.",,False,self,False,t3_16qzue

1342116786.0,wgcg9,Why I liked Prime 2: Echoes better than Prime 3: Corruption (warning: wall of text),MelancholySpork12,48,10,53,"After picking up the Metroid Prime Trilogy

On a whim, since a lot of the changes made from Prime 1 to Prime 2 were dropped in Prime 3, and a lot of logical improvements along with them. As a result, it almost felt like Prime 2 actually came after Prime 3!

One of the most tangible improvements exclusive to Prime 2 is scanning. In Prime 2, and items don't count as logbook entries. This makes sense to me since most people wouldn't think to scan those anyway. Echoes is also the only game that lets zoom in and rotate the the 3D model of everything you scan. I think this feature is beyond cool, especially since, Echoes has a lot of very unique enemy designs. Why was this dropped from Corruption? 

Corruption feels like a step backwards in a lot of ways. One of the biggest disappointments in Corruption, and the boss music is unfailingly bland. I can't even remember what it sounded like, and I beat it four days ago. Echoes, on the other hand, had a lot of stand-out tracks and a MUCH better presence. Even the less interesting, ""ambient"" tracks do a great job of setting the atmosphere, whereas Corruption's music suffers from a terrible case of ""blah""-ness. 

Another huge problem I had with Prime 3 is the abundantly obvious change in art style. I think Retro Studios wanted to move as far away from Prime 2 as possible, and the boss fights are massive in scale. It's just awesome. The exception, I will admit, are the dark worlds. They start out bland and never get better - and this is probably the biggest criticism of Prime 2, and I won't lie, it's a valid one.

Also I (at the same time) beat Metroid 1 in its entirety for the first time (I got stuck last time many years ago)


1. Zero mission is about 10 times better than Fusion, the entire thing is about as linear as you can get, they removed chain wall jumping, they removed bomb jumping. And the entire game is narrated to you from a dumb computer. For example in Zero mission I chain bomb jump/walljumped my way to the varia suit before I had high jump or ice beam, and it was not easy. You could never do things like that in fusion. 

2. Zero mission truly is a remake of Metroid 1

3. Zero mission's final boss on hard with 100% difficulty is the hardest boss fight in GBA history. No really
And even if you kill him you still have to escape which is no easy task when you can only take 6 shots from anything before you die.

4. Some of those 100% missile tank challenges are hard as balls

First, so you can still wear a headset for audio. Only get the Sony if you absolutely do not want to wait for the Rift.

Then get yourself the Razer Hydra. I would suggest getting a wiimote and a bluetooth adapter but I've tried it and the bluetooth just does not work well off-console. The hydra works as a wiimote and has much higher accuracy with even less latency. It's more expensive but it's better all around (double nun-chuck!) 

Get yourself the Dolphin Emulator and pop your Prime 3 disc into the drive.

What you get: Your vision is completely filled by the game screen, no outside visual distractions, just the visor and what's before it. You move your hydra controller and the target reticle moves across the inside of Samus' ship, turning your vision. You are Samus.

Controls the same as the wii, health, etc. The headphones putting the sound right to your ears and blocking outside noises. Protip: If you turn off music and leave in sound effects it will be *perfect* immersion

I've tried out a mock-up of this using the Sony HMZ and a Wii mote, and the wii mote latency is just too high with a bluetooth adapter on your computer.

I haven't been able to get my hands on a Rift

If you don't know what I mean

I had just escaped the Pirate frigate and watched as a newly revived Ridley escaped. Samus jumped in her ship and the chase began. I watched as the ship descended slowly to the planet's surface as the familiar music began slowly, and that glorious fanfare played. I assumed control of her and realized it was raining. At the time, effects like that were rare in games, so I looked up. The rain was hitting my visor. That moment right there forever solidified me as a fan. Even more than first stepping on Zebes to save the Baby way back in 2000 when I first played Super Metroid. I've never found a game that had quite the same feeling of discovery as Metroid.

Prime 1 felt like the 3D Metroid game I had longed for since childhood. I've been playing the series since the original but I didn't get my hands on it until a couple of years after it was released. I bought Metroid 2 and Super Metroid as soon as they came out and only played Fusion and Zero Mission on emulators because I honestly don't have the money to buy the console and then the games.

There are certain aspects about Prime 3 (weapon/suit upgrades for example) that I liked only slightly more. However, game play, etc. were top notch. It was the best game of the entire series since Super Metroid.

I know there's a lot of people that prefer Prime 2 in the series. Don't get me wrong

Maybe I'll change my mind once I finish the game but as of this point

- Reaching the Sanctuary Fortress from Metroid Prime 2. If only the whole game was as cool as that place...

- Fighting Thardus from Metroid Prime. One my favorite fights in the series.

- Getting to Green Brinstar in Super Metroid. It feels like the game is truly starting.

- Dodging the SA-X in Fusion. Most tense I've ever felt in a GBA title.

- Opening moments from Metroid Prime 3: Corruption. I love to dick around with all the gimmicks in Samus's ship.

8.) Metroid Prime 3
9.) Metroid: Zero Mission

Then after the events of Zero Mission, and the Primes (Despite what Sakamoto said &lt;/offtopic&gt;). The GFed decided to remove all Metroids from Existence, and send Samus to SR388. (Metroid 2)

Further on, spawn Metroids like she could in Metroid Prime 1?


Honestly, the other games can't compare to. They have really focused in the whole ""Metroid"" being the real monsters here, which I felt was lacking in the other games, despite them being called ""Metroid"". I mean sure, there are metroids in the games, but they are mostly just creeps hanging in around in the atmosphere, one of the more difficult creeps

However in the Prime games, is in fact a Metroid in Samus Phazon suit. 

And remember the fight in Metroid Prime 1? That really left an impact on you


And sure, primitive animals that are simply defending their territory which they have infested. Here they appear to be self-aware, as if they have a predatory goal. They are hungry for preys, and despite them being parasites, they are intelligent enough to adapt after their predators. This gives a really eerie and scary effect considering that a parasite is usually just a primitive creature inside your body, following its instincts. Here it seems as if this parasitical creature is in fact conscious and self-aware. 

The whole thing makes me wonderfully uncomfortable.

**Gorea:** According to Alimbic lore Gorea is a shape-shifter and smashed into Alinos (I think it was Alinos

Gorea demolished nearly the entire Alimbic race

After collecting the eight Octoliths Samus makes it to the Oubliette, Spire, Trace, Noxus, Sylux, and Weavel. Gorea is accidentally freed and he drains the six bounty hunters of their weapons and abilities (similar to how Metroid Prime did to the Space Pirates.).

During the fight with Gorea he can switch between the six hunters' weapons and suck Samus' energy via an orange tentacle. Samus shoots six triangular structures on the wall in a certain order whilst defeating Gorea's first form resulting in a battle with Gorea's more powerful, and found by Samus. Gorea is defeated, and explodes along with the Oubliette, while Samus Aran and the other six bounty hunters escape.

**The Omega Cannon:** This weapon is highly radioactive (just like Phazon) and is extremely powerful. It is the only thing that can defeat Gorea's final form. Strangely

**The ""Ultimate Power"":** Gorea was very intelligent

So if this ""Ultimate Power"" really exists it is probably Phazon

**The Verdict:** We know that Phazon has a far more powerful form: Red Phazon

We know that Phazon-corrupted creatures can barely be harmed by conventional weapons

Gorea's final form can only be killed by the Omega Cannon which suggests that it is indeed a concentrated Phazon weapon used to overload Gorea.

Gorea shows the ability to suck life-energy

Almibic lore also says Gorea is cancerous

Redesign is a rom hack, and sometimes finding your way forward can be tricky, but it makes it that much more rewarding.  I have to admit, I abused save states quite a bit myself, and even had to use a video guide at one or two points to figure out where to go next.  My first play through was a total of 16 hours with around 75% item collection.  In time I may return for a 100% run.  Some things to note about Redesign are the increased gravity, heavy use of wall jumping, occasional use of double bomb jumping, infinite bomb jumping and other advanced techniques.

After my time with Redesign

This rom hack takes the tileset from the GBA Metroid Zero Mission and overlays it onto the SNES Metroid to great effect.  It feels like a worth sequel to SM, alterations to the firing speed of all the weapons, increased door scrolling speed, changes to the map interface (Mmm QoL changes) and a few new enemies.

Anyone who considers their self to be a Metroid fan should experience these two titles.

A third title I look forward to is [Super Metroid Eris](http://m2k2.taigaforum.com/post/sm_super_metroid_eris.html).  Note it is already completed, and from what I've read the quality of the hack easily compares to Redesign and Super Zero Mission.

To install these hacks

You will also need the version of the rom titled Super Metroid (JU) (!)

Eventually, so yeah. But ever since the Zero Suit was introduced, and Metroid Other M, I've felt some part of me slowly rot. It never died, no. It rotted. And it feels as if it is still rotting. Every time I see the Zero Suit, or the Metroid Other M game, I get a huge anxiety. It could depress me for a whole day, wasn't portraited like this. 

The Zero Suit.. The Metroid Other M game.. It feels as if the Samus that Nintendo once created didn't excist anymore. She just died. The person I played along with on the Gamecube games. The person who loved doing all these interesting scans on creatures because she was interested, all of these creature entries, and all the lore. Once, I would even imagine myself being behind the visor, being on adventures. (I really felt like this during the game)

She felt mature. A grown woman who was interested in science (Well

But then, nor did she have any brawn. She looked like a typical, weak, accessorie woman from any game with a man as the main character. She wasn't all that intrigued in the beautiful stuff she saw. She was more concerned over this one person, who did nothing more but manipulate her. 

This all has mentally fucked me up. It sometimes has lead to me not being able to sleep well, I even devoted my life to make a project that honors the concept of females being portrayed neutrally in gaming. It was literally a great game. Oh, and it was also the main source of me loving science fiction.


Please reddit.. What should I do for this pain to stop? Am I the only one experiencing this kind of anxiety?

Anyway, and I've been working on a 50-track album that follows the plot of Metroid Prime, called The Hunter. I won't be finished for a few weeks (May 8th!), but I thought I'd start sharing a pre-release on a few mediums to promote it.

-------------------------------------------------------------
My experience
-Personally, elysia or tallon IV and read about it's tragic histories managed to get me really fascinated. Seeing how they started, how they prospered, what made their downfall, how they worked against it and how their civilisation ended. I whould pass half an hour and more only to read them and imagine the whole thing in my head. Even more when I got in the valhalla. I remember imaginating dark samus enter the ship and getting away with the aurora with all the evidences and hints the lore/place game me and recreated it like a crime scene.

-I think it's the importance gauge that I think they should have left off the games. It takes you by the hands/obligated you to scan something just for the % at endgame and told you what was needed to scan/not needed and kinda ruined the fun of scanning just for immertion when I feel it.

1356234692.0,15b7us,Whilst we're on the topic of Metroid V story ideas...,Mr_Pennybags,25,8,12,"There's been a few story ideas on r/Metroid recently

Similar to *MinusTheFire's* opening, and they succeed in removing the majority of it's functions, but the X's integration into both the suit and her own body makes it impossible to completely dispose of, it has become an extension of her that she can summon and control at her will. Samus is imprisoned for her crimes for several months, but after Overhearing that the jettisoned *Secret Lab* has been almost tracked down to a tiny blip of a homing signal, Samus activates the living suit and fights her way out of the Galactic Federation's prison and to her ship so that she can track down and destroy anything that may have survived, or anything that the Federation can use to rebuild their secret projects.

Using the digitalised Adam to help her track the signal, smouldering remains of the lab at it's heart. Samus touches down and investigates on foot. On board, Samus finds the remains of the Metroid's evolutionary stages, killed in the crash, but no sign of the living Metroids or the SA-X she trapped inside. A wall has been torn apart by the crash and reveals another few rooms of the lab she did not see before, as she had hastily began it's jettison before she had a chance to properly explore, in the room she found a computer terminal, but with enough power for her to extract a series of corrupt files, Samus' ability to absorb X parasites harmlessly makes re-integrating the discarded suit into her fusion suit simple

With her old, now Samus can fully explore the planet and dispose of anything she needs to stop the Galactic Federations sick plans...but after only a few steps, she collapses. living inside the discarded suit were Metroid's infected and bred with X-parasites, something deemed impossible by the Galactic Federation, Samus, and her Chozo ancestors, they phaze out of Samus, Samus is once again at low ability and strength

&gt;I know that this already sounds like some X-TROID ALL POWERFUL SAMUS CAN'T WIN fan-fic level writing

Adam tells Samus that he has managed to decipher one of the files, the voice is female, but with a kind of gruffness to it, as if she is dying. The voice gives no introduction, but mentions her attempts to create a blend of mortal enemies, something that should not exist, and something that can be used for more than just weaponry. She seems to be talking about the X-Metroid's that we met earlier, how could she have been experimenting with them?

&gt;The story behind the audio files is that the SA-X, one who can think and feel, it has Samus' strong mind and determination, and begins to use parts of itself and different combinations of Metroid cells and larvae to create something that at it's core shouldn't exist, so that the SA-X may absorb them and become something new entirely, part Metroid, art X-Parasite, where it goes wrong

Samus must navigate the planet finding her old abilities

comment's and suggestions welcome!

EDIT: Here are little mock ups for the X-Metroid and the new SA-X that I designed about a year ago.
The colours for the SA-X were based on the hornoad, fueled by X-troids. Samus doesn't realise this until she delivers the final blow, cracking the shell and revealing a dying, animalistic Samus clone inside who dies in her arms.

The story follows the events of Corruption. Samus is asked for assistance in a conflict that involves the GF and Space Pirates, who have joined the conflict for various reasons. Anyway, at some point Samus learns that the rebels were victims of some kind of mind-altering disease. Towards the end of the beginning, Samus gets infected by the virus that spreads the disease, but instead of crazy, she enters a coma. When she wakes up, she finds out the inert phazon in her body prevented the infection from taking full effect. Because of this, the disease has already spread to several other systems and Samus is asked to help deliver the cure to important parts of the those systems and bring an end to it, Ridley will be infected

As far as gameplay goes, such as Marines and Pirates. Also, there will be flashback episodes that show when Samus first met each BH. There will also be side missions where you get to play as each BH. This will get players used to each BH's gameplay style, which is good because there has to be some killer multiplayer. We'll bring Kraid back. Finally, Samus gets a melee weapon, as do all the other BHs.

I'd never thought too much of Theron as an actress, she's a strong woman who has a knack for getting herself into (and out of) tough situations. She's seen, experienced, and survived situations where any normal person would have broken under the strain, and so should be quiet, dignified, and have a serious presence to her. Samus isn't the joking or quipping type, somber

If you haven't seen Prometheus yet, and that's the most important thing to her. She's tough and demanding, but isn't cruel or callous. There's a great scene where Theron makes an unpopular decision in order to protect the crew, where you really get a sense that she understands the idea of ""the greater good"", and doesn't hesitate in protecting those under her care. 

It was a really surprising performance

My first conundrum is Other M. From a purely gameplay perspective, blah blah, you have heard this all before, but what should be done to fix it? Should Nintendo scratch it out as if it never existed? Should there be a short cut scene in the next metroid game explaining that during the events of Other M Samus had an intense case of cramps and period related problems. How can they ever redeem this? Will they just declare that it is not cannon? That would be difficult since they so obviously tried to link it to Super Metroid. 

The second issue is gameplay. Other M brought some interesting ideas to the table with gameplay mechanics

I feel like retro has run the first person perspective through its paces already. I love the prime games. I could rave about them all night

I personally want a new direction. I don't want a step backward like an exclusively sidescrolling Metroid or an exclusively first person Metroid. I want another leap in a direction that forces us to experience the metroid universe in a way we haven't before. I want a change that was as shocking as going from super metroid to prime was.

So anyway

The reason the chozo created the metroid is specifically for the x parasite. They did not take in to the fact that the metroids would starve after the x was eradicated because the foremost goal was to eradicate the x, and infect robots.) They could also become sentient or semi-sentient when they infected certain things (think SAX). 

I know a lot of you don't like Halo

The point I thought of while reading the last chozo thread is that if the chozo had the blueprint for the metroid for a long time (it seemed like a recent creation in the manga), they could have created metroids to use as a weapon or experiment on the new planet. When the chozo finally found Phaaze, something went horribly wrong, such as the metroids or the radiation killing the chozo, and the metroids made it on to Phaaze. 1000 years of being left alone and under incredible evolutionary pressure from the phazon, the metroids evolved in to a similar but more advanced species: the metroid prime.

Ok, I thought Super Metroid was almost perfectly executed, all things considered, and it felt to me like Other M was almost an attempt at a 3d re-make of the classic 2d games yet at the same time, add all the complexity of a modern game. This lead the game to fall flat in a 3 major areas. These would be, in no particular order, controls/gameplay, and extremely poor use of cutscenes. 

The controls sucked, I must say they did remarkably well with the controls considering the limitations of just the wii remote, but there was absolutely no point in the game where I said ""Ya, these controls are really beginning to make sense."" Ultimately it felt like controls were tacked on as an afterthought to what was intended to ultimately be a cinematic experience. 

If there's anything that really kills a game for me, boring. I'd be willing to bet even some of the hardcore Half Life fans will admit it's dialog heavy at times. Now multiply this by  twenty-eight thousand nine hundred sixty-four and you get Other M. This is covered in depth in the EC video above, so I'll just say long monologues get boring even in written form. And if you have to introduce monologue, do it in a more creative manner. This will also allow us to view other people's perspectives. Remember scanning all the pirate data and chozo lore in MP1 and the other texts found in the prime games? None of this was spoon fed or shoved down our throats, but left for us to enjoy as we wished, and gave the gamer an ultimately better, if not more mysterious, just running from objective to objective, most of the longer speeches could have been condensed into something 25% as long and still be more engaging/believable if done right. 

And last... HOLY CUTSCENES, from a technical standpoint, I will admit that some of those cut-scenes looked damn good! However, they way they portrayed Samus was a little obnoxious, and in my opinion, borderline offensive. They sure LOVED showing the skin-tight zero-suit as much as they could, complete with the camera doing full body pans (Though, after all). As a guy who takes some pride in saying I enjoy games where the female protagonist is non-sexualized, the amount of dialog might have necessitated such long scenes

I really wanted to like the game. i really did. i watched all the videos before release with my mouth hanging open, I simply couldn't get into it. Now, nearly a year and a half later, I forced myself through it and came out feeling like the game never really did anything for me. Super Metroid did so much more with so much less. I'm looking forward to Fusion and Zero mission, two games I have high hopes for. I'm sure I won't be disappointed.

Its a blatant rip-off of the Metroid formula: side-scroller where you explore a massive underground maze, but give it a try and you'll know what I mean within 5 minutes of playing it.
 
Anyways, but the graphics are 3D, and enemies can be found anywhere in the 3D background - meaning you are able to shoot out of plane.  

Anyways, the powerups, a simple mission of containing some catastrophe, and the fear of a powerful entity (dark Samus, Samus-X) . But I'd like to see all of this brought to life in a beautiful, side-scrolling, 3D world!

Have huge chunks of the world and minibosses that can be skipped entirely (at the cost of some nifty new upgrades)! I want that feeling of isolation in a hostile world again.

Randomly Generated Adventure mode - If this game is 2D tile based, or missile doors before you get missiles, etc).

Something of a story - the Metroid games have contained a huge amount of BACK lore, I can describe almost all of the Metroid games in single sentences. Metroid Prime managed to display Samus' emotion and reactions without a single word or facial expression, and Metroid Prime II tried to have a greater narrative. But, fuck extensive cutscenes. If you have them, keep them short. I certainly like Fusion, though.

Either put Metroid's in or drop the name - In Hunters and Fusion, they're weird-ass mutations and certainly not proper Metroids (neither game even has an ice beam)!

He had sent it over to Florida with my Nintendo Wii and I decided to give it a chance, it got me hooked.

The level design, the enemies, the bosses, the sheer attention to detail and all of it on a console I barely played! I haven't felt this much satisfied beating a game in a LONG time, especially since the last game I beat was Mass Effect 3.

After beating Corruption (82% item collection), most stores here don't sell Gamecube or GBA games, so I'll have to buy them online but it'll be incredibly worth it.

I was in the mood for going through the Prime trilogy again, I hope I can at least spark some discussion.

The scans and logs all indicate that Aether is experiencing vast instability in the form of storms, which get worse as its planetary energy is drained away. Ignoring the sci-fi-esque nature of the Metroid universe, how does this make any sense?

Let's simplify things and assume that planetary energy refers to the amount of geothermal energy (the scans say it also includes solar and ""bio"" energy, volcanic eruptions, and the like are basically the release of all that thermal energy. It's basically the planet's core cooling down. Earth is a geologically dynamic place because its tectonic plates are in constant upheaval and motion, which is fueled by all of the pent-up heat inside the core and mantle. It is also responsible for producing our planet's magnetic field. Contrast this with Mars, whose core has long since cooled, has no magentic field and, as far as we can tell

All of that in mind

Bonus questions: Aether and Dark Aether are actually the same planet, but surely Dark Aether's corrosive atmosphere would linger for a while. Also, this would double Aether's atmosphere, and consequently the atmospheric pressure, near instantly.

-After playing the Gameboy titles so much

-I love the depth of gameplay! In my playthrough I mastered the wall-jump, and mid-air morph ball SNES style. I really felt like I was becoming more formidable while slowly learning and becoming adept at these ""secret"" moves along-side Samus herself becoming more powerful with upgrades.

-Being able to disable upgrades is AWESOME

-Hearing the themes from Torvus Bog and Magmoor Caverns in 16-bit was worth the 50 bucks for the controller alone.

-I personally think the x-ray scope is awesome! Why all the hate?

-Getting Super Missiles and Power Bombs early on was different

-I almost became stuck right after getting the Wave Beam but with a quick little bit of research I was able to try a Crystal Flash with exactly 11 power bombs left! Awesome feeling to be so trapped but for there to still be an obscure escape!

-2D Grapple Beam FTW

-I got stuck on ""noob bridge"" :( but after figuring out there was a sprint button I used it and loved sprinting the whole game!

-2D Charge Beam combos! Very cool!

1369738169.0,1f6xvu,So after a couple of years of putting it off I finally bought it... [Trilogy],OrsenPike,1,1,3,"So I have owned a Wii for many years and a GC before that which is where I first played the first Prime game and was blown away by it. It was without doubt the best FPS I had played in years. CoD

Anyway fast forward almost 10 years and I still have my Wii but due to a pretty crazy life the past few years I never got the chance to play the second and third Prime games on the GC and Wii. 

Which leads up to last week and me getting a new job which will mean I have much more time for myself and my family as well as a little bit more cash to buy some things for myself :) So what did I buy first? Well Metroid Prime Trilogy of course! I was going to pick up a second hand copy from eBay but decided to treat myself to a lovely new copy. Cost me £40 so a little expensive for such an old game but as it isn't easy to get hold of and the fact it is actually 3 full games I don't mind. 

Anyway it arrived this morning and it is glorious. My Zelda games have always been my pride and joy to own but I seriously think the Trilogy might now be my favourite. Everything about these games is just perfection. I am so happy I finally got around to buying the Trilogy.

So yeah that is my Tuesday morning Metroid post. Sorry if this is boring to others and I know it is a sort of repost as many
