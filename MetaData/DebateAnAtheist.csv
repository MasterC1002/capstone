I'll admit that I don't think that there is a god anymore. Is it possible to prove? Absolutely then prove it. But the God that is talked about by humans? More specifically Abrahams God? No.

Abrahamic(? word idk) believers firmly say that God is Benevolent

A good point towards debating your religion is probably not a question. ""If God doesn't exist

Another reason that particular example was bad is that you don't need an answer for everything. ""I don't know"" is a valid option.

Atheists don't hate God. They're not rebelling against him. Lacking appreciation for God's actions isn't really applicable. They don't worship Satan. They don't believe they're going to hell

How good something is doesn't matter when it comes to truthfulness.

Data can point in all different directions. Be very careful

If you have to somehow change or ignore large amounts of facts, or evidence in order to prove that your book or part of your book is merely POSSIBLE, you may want to reassess your beliefs.

Evidence isn't always good evidence.

1372575743.0,1hcs14,I Have Questions about Atheism.,oasker,92,14,140,"Hello reddit

I'm a Christian and I was hoping people here could help me better understand some aspects of atheism. I've watched countless debates with great atheist minds like Richard Dawkins, Lawrence Krauss, Peter Atkins...etc but I feel as though Im missing something. I've done my best to study all facets of both sides of the argument regarding the existence of God, but of course I can only see things through my own bias. I just want to make sure I dont have a case of ""confirmation bias"" syndrome, and if I do I'd like to be cured! 

Questions: 

1.) What scientific evidence does atheism present in the argument against God?

*I know to some this question will seem ridiculous, syllogisms may help clear things up.


2.) What is the strongest philosophical argument against God's existence?


3.) What reason does an atheist have to behave morally?

*Note I am not saying an atheist CANNOT behave morally. I understand evolution is the origin for many atheists. I am more curious as to why an atheist who believed that would continue to act morally when at times it comes at the expense of their pleasure. I hope this does not sound too crude, I do not mean to draw straw men of atheist, please rebut me if my understanding is wrong.) 


4.) How would an evolutionary process lead to humans general goodwill toward one another and the species as a whole?

*The survival of the fittest mentality does not seem to fit here. Wouldn't the earliest species with this trait would not survive very long in a world that does not feel quite so compassionate?
 

5.) I've heard it said that religion is a product of evolution

6.) Do you consider atheism a religion? Why or why not? 

*Dictionary.com defines 'religion' as such: 'a set of beliefs concerning the cause, especially when considered as the creation of a superhuman agency or agencies, usually involving devotional and ritual observances, and often containing a moral code governing the conduct of human affairs.'

*Note that the aspect of superhuman agencies are not required to qualify an ideological framework as a religion.

1.  Your argument on the impossibility of God from omniscience doesn't follow because your argument is a straw man.  Premises 1 &amp; 2 of your argument are false as it pertains to the Christian God, (3) can't be tempted with evil, (4) can't cease to exist, etc.  Thus, omnipotence must be defined in accord with historic, Christian orthodoxy, otherwise you're just setting up a straw man.     

2.  Eutyphro's Dilemma has been answered for thousands of years by Christians, Graham Oppy, etc.) don't use these types of arguments because they've been refuted for centuries.

3.  ""Direct evil: such as God killing children throughout the bible."" - God doesn't ""kill children throughout the Bible"".  There are three places in Scripture where God commands the complete annihilation of a people group such that it would have included children:  Humanity (Gen. 6-9); the Canaanites (Deut. 20) and Amalekites (1 Sam. 15).  All of these texts are judgment texts wherein God brings judgment because the culture was so debauched that it was irreparable and it failed to heed God's call to repent.  See here for discussion

4.  ""Evil by design: such as designing a planet which would produce natural disasters.""  - The world is the way that it is because our first parents told God to shove off; and He obliged.  This not only affected us morally

5.  ""Second hand evil: A God who designs free-will has designed a potential and perhaps even a proclivity for his creation towards evil acts."" - First off

Question:  If there's no God

6.  ""Also

7.  ""What was God doing in the billions of years before humanity?"" - Existing.  Psalm. 90:2 

8.  ""Why is there so much extra space?"" - Not sure how this is relevant to the existence/non-existence of God

9.  ""What was there before god?"" - This question begs the question by assuming God had a beginning because He's contingent upon something outside of Him for His own existence.  But God is a se.  Dawkin's arguments notwithstanding

10.  ""What created god?"" - See above.

11.  ""If the Bible/Koran/insert-holy-text-here is not the literal word of god then all of it has to be discarded as a complete work of fiction."" - This is just a bare-naked assertion without any argument or question.  What do you mean ""the literal word of god""?  Do you think Christians read their Bibles in a wooden, genre, date of composition, etc.  The same principles used to interpret any ancient document should be used to interpret the Bible.  The fact that some believers don't interpret it this way doesn't mitigate against its truthfulness, it mitigates against the erroneous method the uninformed believer uses to read the ancient text.  

12.  ""Without the Bible there is no reason to believe that a god exists."" - Actually

13.  ""All of the theories we have work fine without invoking this unnecessary factor."" - This begs the question by assuming that God is unnecessary.  But that's the very question that remains to be answered.  Occam's razor only applies if we multiply entities unnecessarily.  What remains is for you to show that God is unnecessary instead of merely asserting it.

14.  ""The way I see it, rigor, and intelligence.  Ancient peoples didn't have modern conceptions of science, but they weren't ""less intelligent"".  Far from it.  

The existence of the divine has been held by all ancient and modern cultures simply because within our species

I'd be glad to get lunch with you sometime and chew the fat so that we can discuss these things at a greater level.

1339328505.0,uuhgn,Had my first debate with a fundamentalist on the street yesterday,DirtySketel,83,12,65,"Hope you don't mind me venting how utterly frustrating it was (but also slightly hilarious the things he came out with).

He gave me a piece of anti-gay literature while I was walking through Birmingham, and the first thing I pointed out was the first bullet point had a wholly ridiculous assertion: Couples in ‘real marriages’ are less likely to have abortions than sam-sex couples. I told him how ridiculous this assertion was. The second point was that gay people could never raise a child well, and I asked why. I was very nervous.

His response was ‘common sense

And that's when the debate went into a wholly frustrating direction. He said that God made one man and one woman in the Garden of Eden. I said that Eden isn't a real place. He said to prove it


He asserted there was not a shred of evidence for evolution. I said that the fields of genetics, palaeontology and general comparative anatomy all provide overwhelming evidence for evolution. He gave me some macro/micro evolution crap, and I explained that those weren't scientific terms, and that macro-evolution is just evolution across 4 billion years. Then he asked for a single example of macro-evolution happening. I told him about how we understand on a molecular level the exact places at which mutations occurred that separated us from the other great apes. He said that all was doing was pointing out similarities between creatures genes. He said ‘I have atoms and so do stars. Does that mean I am evolved from stars?’ .... ‘Yes!’. Then he said ‘All of Shakespeare's works contain full-stops. Does that mean they evolved from one another?’ I said no, because they don't reproduce.

He replied that this was just an analogy. I told him it was a terrible analogy.

Then he repeated this argument but with cars and bikes both having wheels, and it's actually probably more like 60% of our DNA is shared with the fruit fly. He said that scientists had never been able to grow bacteria that was a new species because being a new species means to be unable to reproduce with one's own siblings. I told him that scientists had found gradual variation in bacteria lots of times, and that bacteria don't mate anyway.

So I mentioned palaeontology and how he could head down to the Natural History Museum and see lots of fossil evidence. He said there were no transitional fossils. I explained that all fossils are transitional

He said that this was just evidence for the great flood, not being a geologist. He then brought up the Cambrian Explosion, and I didn't have enough knowledge of this topic to comment either, rather just had to sit there and let him spew that this was ‘proof’ of creation, because it was at this point that there were ‘actual species’. I explained that throughout all of evolution, every organism was an ‘actual species’.

Then, including simple deduction ‘All humans have parents. You are a human. You have parents. Your parents were human, they have parents. Parents parents are called grandparents, therefore you have a grandfather.’ and by suggesting looking at family history etc. Every time he just said ‘that's not proof, that's not proof’. I asked what the point was. He said if I couldn't even prove that he had a grandfather, how could I possibly have evidence that he was descended from simpler organisms? He said it was impossible for science to have evidence for anything. How he manages to function without accepting evidence for things like ‘stepping into traffic is dangerous’, I don't know.

Then he gave a crappy argument from irreducible complexity, as for light sensitive cells to evolve, the organism would already need to have vision (????).

Another little gem was that since Darwin was unaware of Mendel's work on genetics when he wrote *On The Original Of Species*, doesn't make Darwin wrong. He even said Darwin himself didn't believe in his own theory...

I occasionally tried to bring the discussion back to the homosexual rights thing

He brought out the Kalam Cosmological Argument. I responded that cause and effect happen only as a consequence of time, and that just because we don't know how the universe began, there's no reason to conclude ‘Wizard did it’. He said ‘how do you know time is a property of the universe?’ I explained that well supported theories based on real experimental and natural data like General and Special relativity show that time is affected by movement through space, gravity etc. He said ‘Argument from authority! You're just quoting Albert Einstein!!’ I explained it would only be an appeal to authority if I'd said that was true *because* Einstein said it. Rather, I was saying it was the best explanation because empirical evidence supports it.

Then he said ‘cause and effect does not need time’. I said ‘Yes it does.’ He said ‘NO! 4th Law Of Logic: Cause and effect!’ I said how can cause and effect possibly occur without time? He said ‘Easy. 1+1=2. That was cause and effect’. I said no it wasn't

At which point

He shook my hand and said god bless.

I'm sorry

Just as a note: I don't adhere to Fundamentalism of any sort. Attempting to interpret or fit my words into a limited Fundmentalist context will lead us to a different place. If you don't think Religious texts can be interpreted any way but literally

 There is a type of Atheist that will say ""Prove the existence of God."" My response to this is ""Prove the existence of Love."" I have recieved four rebuttles

 1) This is just word play. 

 This is the one I understand the least. Someone has experienced something that doesn't fit into their previous experiences, they feel confident resting on the concept that is called ""God."" Other cultures have created different words for this concept, of course, but it makes sense that someone raised in a Western Culture would use Western words to describe their experiences. 

 This statement seems to be a deliberate misunderstanding of the term ""God""

 2) Love's just a concept or idea

 I think this is an incredibly limited way of looking at our existence. Everything that has become physically manifest began as an idea. Even something as biologically basic as a baby begins as an idea first. Ideas and concepts shape us and guide us

 3) We can observe the effects of Love

 This is an outright duplication of an arguement for the existence of God that has been in use for several thousand years. Observing the effects of God has been in the theories of almost all Theologians throughout the entire existence of the concept of God. If we accept this arguement for Love

 4) Love is a chemical reaction that we can observe
 
 This is the most common rebuttle, that love is created through a chemical reaction. 

 Now, and no one has been kind enough to link them to me. This forces me to speak from a place of admitted ignorance about these tests, so I can only percieve what might have occurred. 

 I imagine that they connect someone to a series of brain imaging equipment and take note when that person claims to experience the sensation of Love. I'll give this test the benefit of the doubt and assume that what the subject claimed to be Love is actually Love.

------

&gt;**I understand that people make a choice**

Is that choice free? Why do you do the things you do? Do you recognize that you have been influenced and changed by every experience you have had during your life? Do you recognize that every experience you have had was causally dependent on the circumstances that you were born into? If you were born at a different time and a different place and to different parents you would have had an entirely different set of experiences and they would have influenced you completely differently and due to this you would be a completely different person. In fact

We don't have the type of free will that you think we do

&gt;**When Adam was created there was no sin.**

By this surely all you mean is that no one had sinned yet... big deal. No one had flown in an airplane yet either.

&gt;**Adam was incapable of sin because there was no way to do it besides the one commandment that God had for him

So... he was capable of sin then...

&gt;**Now we will be made totally clean when we enter heaven because of Jesus and there will be no tree to eat from so we will be incapable of sinning.**

Why was the tree there to begin with? Didn't God create the garden? Didn't God put the tree there? Then didn't God actually temp Eve, a scapegoat, a fall guy? Wasn't it actually God that tempted Eve to sin, after telling her not to. Wasn't it God that did not create Eve with the knowledge of good and evil, knowledge that is necessary to know that it was wrong to eat the apple, that it was wrong to disobey God? How could Eve know it was wrong to disobey God if she did not possess the knowledge to determine right from wrong, which was imparted to her only after eating from the tree?

&gt;**so we will be incapable of sinning.**

So we won't sin only because we won't have the opportunity to? Is that really meaningful? God gave us the opportunity to sin on Earth by placing the tree (and the snake) in Garden

&gt;**God punishes people because they're guilty.**

God created us, he didn't have to put the tree in the garden but he did on purpose, and so He caused Eve to sin on purpose, and so he caused the ""fall of man"" on purpose, and so He caused all sin on purpose, and so he purposely made people to be guilty, and so he purposely made people so that he could punish them.

&gt;**It's totally fair.**

It's not at all fair if you consider the story you're telling me in the context of the attributes that you apply to God and if you think about it for more than a minute.

&gt;**The difference is that we as Christians are spared not only because we follow him but because the law is that because of sin you must die.**

He made the law, but he made us to sin, and he made us to be punished. He could save all of us if He wanted to, but He will only save those that bow to Him.

The way you present God makes him sound like a sadistic asshole to anyone who spends any time thinking about the story as a whole

I am a Christian, but I also do not believe in a literal interpretation of Genesis, because it is a children's story. Christians that take these things literally embarrass the rest of us and make our beliefs seem ridiculous.

1356790334.0,15mhob,UPDATE: Debate challenge postmortem.,SeaBrass,64,16,80,"This thread is a follow-up to the original post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/134l0y/my_super_religious_father_believes_he_knows_more/) in which a young atheist asked for volunteers to debate his overbearing Christian father.  I agreed to do so

As often happens in these situations I never received a reply from the father to my introductory remarks.  A few weeks later

Here are my introductory remarks:

------------------------------------

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. While I am an atheist I do believe that the question of the existence of god is one of the most important questions that we can ask

One of the biggest problems in religious debates is the tendency for each side to tell the other what they believe. I will make every effort not to do this. For example, or that evolution is false. In return I ask for the same courtesy. Do not assume that being an atheist means that I have no morals, that I believe in nothing, or that I worship Satan. None of these statements accurately describes my beliefs.

I was a Christian for fourteen years before becoming an atheist (not counting the years when I was a child and the years before I made a conscious decision to become a Christian). I had a “born again” experience and spoke in tongues. I preached the gospel to friends, including on overseas missions trips. I faithfully attended church and was deeply involved in church leadership including teaching Sunday School and leading Bible studies. I fully understood the distinction between having a relationship with Jesus and following rules legalistically. I studied apologetics intensively and debated with non-Christians on a regular basis. And it is because I value truth that when I could no longer accept that Christianity was true I left the faith.

I consider myself to be a gnostic atheist. That is, including the god of the Bible and the Christian god more generally. It is incorrect to assert that I must know with certainty that no gods exist in order to say that no gods exist. If absolute certainty and knowing all facts in the universe is the standard of proof then we are all agnostics.

I believe that claims should be subject to the outsider test. This test provides objective criteria to determine which, is true. Without a standard for determining which religion is true we cannot know if any of them are true. The outsider test is based on a few principles. First, we tend to believe what we wish to be true. Second, we are subject to confirmation bias, which causes us both to seek out evidence which confirms our prior beliefs while ignoring counter evidence and also causes us to look upon evidence that we accept more favorably while being more skeptical of opposing views. Third, neurological studies have shown that how certain we feel about a belief is unrelated to whether or not that belief is true. And fourth, the most accurate predictors of a person’s religious beliefs have consistently been shown to be their place of birth and what religion their parents practice. Religions tend to be clustered around certain parts of the world, the outsider test requires that we should treat our own beliefs with the same level of skepticism that we apply to the beliefs of others. For example

What the Christian needs to show, as arguments like the Cosmological Argument seek to do. The Christian must show that Christianity passes the outsider test. If Christianity fails when met with the same objections that you use to reject other faiths, then it is irrational to accept Christianity as true. The Christian must also use religiously salient arguments that lead to the conclusion that their specific god exists, and not just that an impersonal first cause, a most perfect being, or some kind of “higher power” might exist.

To conclude my introductory remarks I want to say a few words about speaking with your son. It is not possible to force someone to believe something. If you are overbearing and arrogant in preaching your beliefs, then you need to tolerate the fact that he may not believe the same way as you do. Maybe you are concerned about doing your duty in trying to lead your son to Christ because you feel that it would reflect badly on you or cause you to receive a lesser reward in heaven if you do not try to convert your son, based on passages like Ezekiel 33. If this is the case, then I think that you can rest easy in knowing that your job is done. You gave it your best effort, and now you can wash your hands of the matter. But I hope that you are not so callous and self-serving as to think that way. I am sure that you are an honest man who prays for his son to be saved, therefore, if the Christian god exists and Christianity is true then you do not need to fear the consequences if your son examines the facts for himself. If the evidence leads any reasonable person to believe that Christianity is true then the facts should bear this out.

Thank you again for your time. I look forward to speaking with you further.

All that said, as well as give solace in times of heartache.  That said, I believe the structure of most organized religions indoctrinate fear, subserviance, and ignorance on a mass scale. In some respect, I think of religion like a pure form of any political system - In small groups, they tend to work perfectly. On a massive scale

Personally, then have the hivemind dissect my worldview piece by piece.

Most of my beliefs come from the writings of Neale Donald Walsch, along with my own personal little take on them.

Some basic tenents of my beliefs - ""God"" is synonymous with Love, and Consciousness. I believe there are levels of consciousness, therefore, levels of ""godhood."" Absolute Consciousness (what we are before birth and after death) really doesn't ""exist"" in the universe - it IS the universe, completely conscious of itself, being everything, yet ""doing"" nothing.

Ergo, the more conscious you are of what that entails, the more likely you are to get it with ease.

From a philosophical standpoint, and that the material world is all that REALLY exists, I (along with others) choose to explore the opposite possibility - that everything we've ever known, or ever will know, about this universe is nothing but Consciousness - as beings grow in consciousness, their ability to manipulate the material world around them increases. 

Finally

So, I'm completely willing to discard any belief I have if a newer one comes along that makes **more** sense. While materialism, in my mind, makes *just as much* sense, I prefer idealism - it just rings truer to me as far as the nature of consciousness no longer being dismissed as ""iunno it just happens, but it doesn't really exist.""

Ninja edit: **TL:DR** God (read: consciousness) doesn't exist? Fuck that

Edit 2 - wow, from now on I'm going to refer to ""consciousness"" as ""god."" Please bare in mind this is not the traditional bearded judging sky god that most religions espouse.

Edit 3 - Okay y'all, I don't have the time, focus, or patience to answer all the great questions left. I highly recommend ""Conversations with God"" for those of you still curious about my definitions of God, consciousness, etc.  As someone put, it's a great story, in some way, and encouraging people to love one another through a ""god"" parable since a lot of people can't understand the concept without it.

There is a huge confirmation bias

1) Obviously Harun Yahya isn't my only source- denying evolution and the holocaust is clearly stupid so I questioned him and looked at many more books and sources. Both sides- I've read stuff like The God Delusion- I wanted to come to an honest decision. My entire journey was just too boring for internet so decided to just go with the first stepping stone.

So-

2) What I've mostly managed to conclude is that these debates never have a winner. There's a reason I haven't become an atheist and my friends haven't become Muslim. We always reach the same impasse where facts and what we think we know can be manipulated to support the conclusions we already have. I know scientific knowledge is never proved, smart, good parents who taught me what my religion teaches and nothing they've ever taught me seemed bad to me (the cretins who misinterpret and use their religion as an excuse to be a disgusting excuse for a human or who judge others because of religion anger me more than almost anything else) so I accepted it. 

When I questioned it, I teach children in poverty and raise money for local people in third world countries- I don't think I'd have the right to say anything if I didn't practice what I preached), and (biggesttheistcopoutevercomingup) hope that they'll get justice in an afterlife. 

I don't think religion and science have to be at loggerheads (moronic idiots who use religion as a shield for their stupidity, I'll interpret things differently. 

There is always going to be an element of blind faith to religion and as irrational as it will probably seem, but just as unshakeable conclusions- but I hope this goes at least a small way to dealing with this sort of war atheists and theists have going and that some time, everyone will just gtf over it and just accept that some people believe and some people don't and it really doesn't matter as long as they don't use either as an excuse to be a twat. 

But I love the deep and indepth comments and discussions you see when you start talking about religion so I'm going to go ahead and leave this open. I just don't really think it's something you can debate successfully over the internet.


ORIGINAL POST----

I've grown up in a pretty scientific family- standard Asian with everybody being either a Doctor, tend to be pretty sceptical about God). My point is-

I would never believe in the existence of God just because somebody told me it was so. When I was about 14

He told me that it was good I was questioning things because our religion wants us to think and come to our own conclusion that we believe it. Despite what the majority of the world seems to think

So basically

I know that to atheists this may sound stupid, and so I was willing to accept it came from someone with knowledge beyond ours. Hilariously, a friend of mine suggested aliens (if you don't believe aliens exist, you're a moron)... But for now, I'm going to go with God.

1334652482.0,sdy9x,i need articulate thoughts on this letter that my extremely intelligent christian friend sent me,dvdsxr,50,5,117,"edit: thanks for all the replies guys... i'm slowly going through them. i appreciate the input and will respond as necessary

i am not trying to have a response written for me. i'd like to see what other like minded people would say if sent something of similar intellectual caliber. i am not going to sum this up with a tl;dr... if you want to take the time to read it, i have no where else to turn to get insight.

this first letter is a my response to a few initial emails







&gt; you should know

&gt; i would also like to point out that, and i have a decent understanding of ""christian thinking"". i have not always been atheist. i believed in god for most of my life, or at least thought i did. i often feel that i always questioned it, but there were times that i knew, without a doubt, that god existed and cared for me

&gt;i don't often say a whole lot to you about how i feel on the subject. for the most part, sent me lengthy messages that are... weighty... with your highly intelligent and well thought out words. i haven't, for the most part, really tried to discuss them with you. at least i don't feel that i have

&gt; if you want to discuss the idea of god, but i think that you might use the bible as proof of that. i do not know that god does not exist, but i also do not know that he DOES exist. i will not discuss it under the assumption that either is true. but which is more likely? i think that for a god to create something as complex as the universe, he would have to be complex enough himself to question where he came from. so who created the creator? which is more likely... humans evolved from the machinery of the universe, or humans were designed by a god that knows what will happen? and if a god knows what will happen, what is the point of sending them to live a life that he knows they will live, only to punish them for rejecting him? 

&gt; these are not questions that i need answered. they are questions that i only ask in question of the ridiculous ideas themselves. these questions only exist because humans have invented the ideas of gods. i feel that there is a perfectly acceptable replacement: life itself. i exist as a product of 13.7 billion years of evolution. whether that is from a complex creator, to be the sole purpose of such a creator. i find that idea to be arrogant and a direct insult to rational thought

&gt; what i want is to talk about these kinds of things in person. i feel that we can have good

&gt; while i feel that my intellectual capacity is less than that of yours

&gt; logic built from the ground up seems to be a dangerous thing to me. it tells me that evidence means next to nil if it presented. that your ideas, will hold in the face of said investigation. that if 2+2=5 was proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, to actually be false, that your logic would tell you to ignore the evidence and maintain that 5 is sound

&gt; i am glad we are friends. but these are some of the reasons i have a difficult time discussing religion or god or christianity with anyone that believes

&gt; and so i end up sharing demeaning links in a facebook status

&gt; but this is the extent that i am willing to discuss it online. we need to see one another

&gt; with or without the beers. guess it doesn't matter 

&gt; i hope that i haven't said anything offensive. i have no intentions of insulting your intelligence. i hold you in very high regard

&gt; i'll be in salt lake this saturday. i doubt i will have time for any serious discussion

&gt; -david




this is his reply:




&gt; David

&gt; Thank you so much for your fascinating letter.  I've been thinking a lot about it.  We didn't get to hang out on this visit, and will be able to go into great length about the topic du jour-- religion and spirituality-- but I want to bring up some preliminaries which are absolutely essential to a clear discussion.  

&gt; One thing I like about these talks is that they invariably involve the fields of science, logic, argumentation, and philosophy-- fields I'm sure we both hold very dear.  

&gt; Knowledge 
When you speak to me, and reason is indeed more sophisticated than yours, it is only because I have spent the time studying these disciplines in a rigorous academic environment.  This hasn't come easily, but has been the result of work.  

&gt; I am currently in a fascinating physics class-- a class that has challenged some of the ways I think about science.  I find myself often musing that “David should be here.”  I think you really ought to consider studying the sciences at a university at some point

&gt; A couple of your remarks require examination.  Most curious is your remark about logic built from the ground up being a dangerous thing.  I think your idea stems from when I told you Lewis builds his argument from the ground up

&gt; Logic itself is not mine or yours.  I may use the process of logic on a different set of assumptions, you cannot disagree with the logic: your disagreement stems from the assumptions.

&gt; The remarkable thing is that logic itself is so robust in its ability to show the conditional truth or falsehood of a claim, you start with a concept that is already defined and proven, and you make baby steps toward the theorem in question.  Each step must be logically equivalent to the last.  Propositional logic is, without question, the foundation of mathematics.  If I tried to prove 2+2=5, it is logic that would forbid me.

&gt; You seem concerned that a person clinging to logic would refute empirical evidence.  This is silly, which is in turn based in logic.  (I have a number of scientific papers and articles to share with you from my classes.  On this issue, see these two papers by R.W. Hamming, and E. Wigner: http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/Hamming.unreasonable.html 
http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences”)

&gt; Previously

&gt; In fact

&gt; We notice something about our world.  We form a null hypothesis-- how we previously thought the world works-- and an alternative hypothesis-- what we now think is going on.  We take data by some experiment, and type II error being the failure to reject a false null hypothesis.  Minimizing type I error usually increases the probability of type II error.  We settle upon an acceptable probability of type I error, say 10% or 5% or 1%, and based on that, we run our statistical test and either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.

&gt; How Do We Do Science?
We never, we get strong statistical evidence in favor of one interpretation of the data over another.  And that is really all we need in order for science to function as a model of our physical world.  Science is not about proof, and it doesn't have to be in order to be extraordinarily useful.  Don't misunderstand me (and do read Oreskes' paper)!  I am not, for instance, making the common misguided statement about certain scientific disciplines that “Well, it's only a theory.”  I know science a lot better than that.  But neither should you make the statement, “It is fact.”  It is a really awesome model of our physical world with great explanatory and predictive power

&gt; In their landmark paper on Punctuated Equilibrium (http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/eldredge.pdf)  , “is colored by theory and expectation.”  He later notes, “Almost all of us adhere, consciously or unconsciously, to the inductivist methodology.  We do not recognize that all our perceptions and descriptions are made in light of theory.”  They go on, and develop their ideas, which you as an evolutionist should read if you haven't already.  Their remarks echo some of the ideas of the philosopher Thomas Kuhn and his concepts of “paradigm shifts.”

&gt; Dark Matter
One important question I have for you is this: Are you only willing to accept as true that which you can measure through subjection to observation and statistical inference?  If so, Zach was telling me about how scientists have recently discovered dark matter as a web that holds everything in the universe together.  He claimed that they had measured it.  I had to stop him there.

&gt; As you may know, measure, or otherwise detect it.  So what is it?  It is a mathematical construct that accounts for the way the universe behaves, under the assumption that gravity is exactly what we think it is.  It is an object that makes the math work out right.  Something with mathematical properties similar to what we call “dark matter” could exist, explaining what we see, or gravity could be fundamentally different than Einstein believed it to be.  

&gt; Zach replied that since he had seen a graphical representation of dark matter on Discovery channel, but right now holds more or less great explanatory power.

&gt; I encourage you to think about how you know the things you know.  Because mathematics and physics are such intellectually inaccessible subjects

&gt; Your Assumptions and Mine
If we are to discuss God, but assume I mean the Christian definition of God-- I'm not interested in proving the existence of the Hindu pantheon or the distant, unrelational god Allah.)  If God is by Christian definition a being uncontained by the universe-- if the universe is his idea, then a system (science) that observes the physical universe and infers things about it simply does not have the necessary machinery to say anything about this God, positive or negative.  It is impossible, because of what science is!  

&gt; This is why I am so adamant that you learn better what science is!  I think you'll acquiesce-- you “fucking love science!”  

&gt; Rather, and I will do the same with mine.  You ask me one question, and I will ask you one question, back and forth.  If your system of thought or mine contradicts or fails to explain some aspect of the world in which we live, it will be duly noted.

&gt; A Remark about Christianity
Before we meet, but the existence of a particular being with certain features.  We have to be talking about the same thing if our discussion is to have any significance.  There are many faiths professing to be “Christian” by virtue of their holding certain beliefs about the person Jesus Christ.  Christianity is well-defined on its own, through the Bible alone.  

&gt; My father, Scientist, also known as the Christian Science Church.  I don't know if you are familiar with their religion, but it is based partly on the Bible, and heavily on Mary Baker Edy's “Science and Health with a Key To the Scriptures.”  My grandmother remains a member of this church: a church with such outrageous ideas it deserves neither the title Christian nor Science.  Do we call them Christians because it is in their name, or because they believe Christ existed?  Do we call them scientists?  

&gt; My uncle, and they too have extra-Biblical documents which they count as scripture, and which truly define their religion.  Was my uncle a Christian?  As he has now come to know the truth of the gospel, he would tell you no, he was not.  

&gt; My grandfather was a Mormon.  As you are a former Mormon,” which actually means “as far as it agrees with current LDS doctrine.”  Forget for a moment that the Bible is a spiritual treatise-- as far as humanity's study of ancient documents goes, the examination of the original Hebrew and Greek (and a little Aramaic) in which the Bible was written, as well as a textual and historical criticism will show that the ancient writers of the Bible do not say the things these three faiths claim that the Bible says.

&gt; I do not doubt you had sincere faith in the LDS worldview as a child.  Now that you have left that church, only superficially the same, while fundamentally different.  I can go into this more, but rather than make this letter too long (which it looks like it will be), I'll refer you to a very good exposition of the subject by Pastor Mark Driscoll: 
http://pastormark.tv/2011/10/18/is-mormonism-a-cult 
He does a fantastic job of explaining this issue.

&gt; My point is that your foundations in the LDS church do not give you an accurate view of what the Bible says

&gt; If you hear only one thing, or Christian Science are religions.  These groups require membership in an organization, and adherence to certain rules to be a “good Mormon” for instance.  Christianity is not about being a “good Christian”.  It is not a man-made religion operating under a mere man's authority; it is a system of belief where the believer affirms the Bible, and all it says, and is part of the Church that operates under Christ's authority alone.  The Christian Church is not an organization like the LDS Church: rather, it is the group of people who have surrendered  their lives to Christ because apart from him we can do nothing.  We no longer need a fallen human intermediary between us and God, for our intermediary is Christ!  We need no additional scriptures or doctrines.  It is all contained in the Bible, given any challenge).  

&gt; Final Words
I look forward to meeting with you.  We have a lot to discuss.  Hopefully this letter  makes you think.  I did not go into Christian arguments

&gt; I look forward to a conversation with you at a higher standard of thought and rationality-- I expect nothing less from you.  

&gt; Yours Truly

Let me start by saying that this is probably a bit of a read


For context, i dont know exactly what the subject is called, but i know he teaches greek, and specializes in the bible. He has been in school for quite a few years now.


He beleives in an old earth


Anyways, or not being applied properly, however, by myself I am not informed enough on the subjects to articulate the exact reasons or correct him without doing a whole lot of extra reading.


I'm hoping that you fine folks who might have a better knowledge and more readily available references might be able to help me address his main points.


I'm going to put down the question I asked him (or sum it up anyways) and then his answers


**My question:**


*Who decides which parts of the bible are taken literally and which parts are no longer relevant? Who decides that one book is just a myth or metaphor while others are accurate historical recordings? Why do we not still follow the rules books that were clearly meant to be laws (like leviticus and deuteronomy) but other things still relevant


**his reply**


 *This is a good question about who decides how to read literature in what way. The bible is a library, which parts are not, etc. and how to thus read them is based on both internal and external evidence - which is true of any literature. It would be altogether surprising if that many authors writing that much all wrote the same types of works all meant to be read the same way.
As far as internal evidence


*For the more ""controversial"" portions


*As far as Genesis goes - it is labeled as primeval or primordial history/saga/myth. There are other creation epics like this in ancient literature. These creation stories explained the origins of the universe for the people who read it. There is little doubt that those who read it believed that is how it happened - they had no reason not to think so. And they were also aware that other cultures around them had different creation stories, etc.*


*As far as Leviticus and Deuteronomy - this is a slightly different question, death, and resurrection of Jesus are central. The New Testament teaches that Christ is the end of the law. That his sacrifice on the cross was the last sacrifice that needed to be made. This means that much of the Old Testament laws in those law books no longer apply. That doesn't mean ALL are thrown out - much of the moral law still stands because they are upheld in the New Testament.*


**my question**


*since you acknowledge science and the facts of evolution and an old earth, was it the first homo sapien? Humans didnt just pop up overnight, so when was sin introduced?*


*Or was the story just meant to illustrate the first 2 humans that sinned? in that case, did god just pick a spot along the line and declare that we are now all sinners?*


**his answer**


*As to the Adam and Eve story — I'm undecided on this one in some senses. First,000 years ago whom we are all related to. Last I read, geneticists seem also to agree that modern humans all came from the area of the Mediterranean. So, scientifically speaking there is an Eve at least - and although we don't have the proof, someone had to have impregnated her :-)*


*I think, you can't deny that we as human beings often make choices that are detrimental to us - it is human nature. Once you have your own child, you'll see that you don't need to teach them how to do bad things and disobey - they just do them, often to be outright defiant :-). *


**my question**


*talking about how I dont understand how someone can claim to have a strong interest in science and at the same time beleive in a divine creator who controls everything*


**his reply**


* From my journeys through this whole science and God discussion I have run across very few scientists who say they are incompatible - that type of rhetoric is primarily confined to the new atheism (i.e. dawkins, and all their disciples).*


*I must say, science has revealed, amazingly, how delicate this whole universe is and how it just so happens to have all the exactly correct properties so that it could not only expand but support carbon-based life forms. This is called the ""fine tuning"" argument (of which the anthropic principle is a part), and it is what caused Antony Flew (THE atheist of our grandparents generation) to become a theist later in life.*


*Finally, given enough time the impossible (life and the universe springing into being randomly) can become possible. But we can't push back any further than the big bang. So now the faith of the atheist sits upon the multiverse theory (i.e. there are an infinite number of other universes) to give us even more chance for the impossible to be possible. But even if the multiverse is true, they still argue it began at the big bang. And it still doesn't solve the issue of how something (this time millions and millions of somethings) came from nothing. So frankly, I'm just as mystified at an atheistic worldview !*


*I thought you might find this interesting - I met a trained biologist (who is a Christian) who only holds loosely to evolution. He isn't that impressed with the number of transitional forms in the fossil record. He said speciation and adaptation are very well attested


That last reply of his is the one I would most like help tackling.

Specifically


I honestly dont mind people having religious beleifs


I'm interested in any comments anyone can make on his points

However, and the position is largely accepted among epistemologists.

by TIMOTHY KELLER

[Introduction](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/xn11k/would_rdebateanatheist_be_up_for_a_book_review/)

[Chapter 1: *There Can't Be Just One True Religion*](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/xsm46/book_review_the_reason_for_god_belief_in_an_age/)

[Chapter 2: *How Could a Good God Allow Suffering?*](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/zizxu/book_review_the_reason_for_god_belief_in_an_age/)

**Chapter 3 - Christianity is a Straitjacket**

&gt;The Christians I know don't seem to have the freedom to think for themselves. I believe each individual must determine truth for him- or herself.

Like chapters before this one I started out hopeful.  I thought this chapter might resonate with me

Rather than truth being something we need to investigate on our own and not take on authority

&gt;In this view, and that is limiting.  

His representations of atheism remind of the serpent in genesis.  He mixes truth and lies

&gt;If you say all truth-claims are power plays...

I don't.  If you want to read his rebuttals to the strawman (which I didn't even find that impressive) feel free but the first half of this chapter was not written to me or any skeptic I know.  

He shifts gears and starts playing his favorite card.  'I know you are but what am I'.  Basically the wrong he has been accused of he claims is done by everyone.  *Community Can't Be Completely Inclusive* is the heading for the next section and his example is priceless.  

He compares an anti-gay organization to a pro-gay organization.  

&gt;Consider an illustration.  Imagine that one of the board members of the local Gay, ""I've had a religious experience and now believe homosexuality is a sin.""

Eventually this board member is kicked out of the club.  He then tries to argue that this exclusion is the same as the anti-gay club kicking out the pro-gay board member.    Intollerance towards intollerance =/= intollerance.  I am so frustrated with this rhetoric and it blows my mind that Keller used this line of reasoning.  It isn't the first time I have heard it

The chapter finally gets interesting when he starts trying to make his own case.  Not because his arguments are well thought out but because it gave me something to address.

&gt;... confinement and constraint is actually a means to liberation.  If you have musical aptitude, practice the piano for years.  This is a restriction, a limit on your freedom.

Say what?  Half way through the chapter I was willing to grant Keller that Christianity is not a straitjacket.  Not because he had addressed any arguments I might have on the subject but because I honestly don't find that topic all that compelling.  I am more interested in its truth value.  However once Keller started giving his viewpoint and stopped attacking a strawman I started to agree that Christianity is a straitjacket.  His defense of the topic was more damming then the strawman's attack on the topic.  He makes the most oximoronic/paradoxical statements (""liberating restrictions"") throughout and then concludes with the worst possible metaphor.

But before we get to the metaphor I loved this strawman he created.

&gt;The popular concept--that we should each determine our own morality--is based on the belief that the spiritual realm is nothing at all like the rest of the world. Does anyone really believe that?

LOL

&gt;One of the most frequent statements I heard was that ""Every person has to define right and wrong for him- or herself.""  I always responded to the speakers by asking, of course.""  Then I would ask, ""Doesn't that mean that you *do* believe there is some kind of moral reality that is 'there' that is not defined by us, that must be abided by regardless of what a person feels or thinkins?""

**NO!!!!!!**  (I screamed at the pages

&gt; Almost always

PWNED!! Keller just pwned the idiot strawman

Anyway lets get onto his awesome metaphor so Keller can help us visualize how free Christianity is.

&gt;One of the principles of love-- either love for a friend or romantic love-- is that you have to lose independence to attain greater intimacy.  

&gt;You cannot enter a deep relationship and still make unilateral decisions or allow your friend or lover no say in hou you live your life.  To experience the joy and freedom of love

&gt;healthy love realtionships involve a mutual loss of independence

So according to Keller

&gt;For a love realationship to be healthy there must be a mutual loss of independence. 

however

&gt;If only one party does all the sacrificing... the relationship will be exploitative and opress[ive]

&gt;At first sight

(the first relationship he described was dehumanizing enough

&gt;While this may be be true in other religions... it is not true in Christianity.

how so?

&gt;God has said to us

And you just opened up a can of worms that you will not address.  Keep digging. 

&gt;St. Paul writes

but its not constricting...

Keller makes the best case that 'Christinaity Is a Straitjacket.'  He is obviously writing to Christians however I would find even many Christians disagree with Keller's viewpoints on this topic.  Thats a might deep hole you got there Keller.  So to summarize Christianity *is* a straitjacket or a shitty exploitative realtionship.

Anyway



Despite your puerile and somewhat aggressive messages

You wanted evidence. I will supply it. And I will expect proper refutation of each and every part of the evidence with counter-evidence that is equally as compelling

There are many routes to take, cosmological and moral arguments through to the Resurrection, historicity of the scriptural (and non-scriptural) accounts and so on. But it will be enough for this stage to look solely at the teleological argument as a start. But remember, unless you refute this with actual evidence that is equally (if not more so) compelling and counters these arguments totally, you have failed at the first hurdle without even managing to look at the rest of the evidence.

So:

Part 1: Evidence for Design and therefore a designer God.

First, both in research as well as education, but mostly in teaching at high level - chemistry, astronomy and cosmology. I hold two science degrees. I took early retirement and am now a priest in the Anglican Church having also a diploma in Christian Studies and a degree in theology. So I am not an armchair critic like so many here on Youtube, who, having read a Dan Brown novel or two, feel they are experts on the Christian Church. Nor am I a card-carrying Creationist who, have done more harm to the cause of Christianity than any atheist has ever even attempted to do. I am now a priest with a scientific background as opposed to my previous career as a scientist who was also a Christian.

So, together with evidence from the universe (and hence God's creation) itself. But first a few misconceptions must be ironed out...

1. Science and 'proof' or more correctly

Regarding the validity of God and an assumption that science can 'prove' things, science can 'prove' nothing. That is not scientific method. Instead, science makes a hypothesis based on an idea, then obtains evidence to support it (or not), and then makes a conclusion based on that evidence. If the evidence and logical (logical, mind you) corollaries to that evidence are overwhelming then it becomes an accepted scientific 'fact' - until it is refined by something better later. As an example, Newton's laws of motion became known as 'fact' (hence the word 'law' as opposed to 'theory') until refined for high velocities by Einstein centuries later in his Special and General Theories of Relativity. They are still not (and never will be) 'proven' but the evidence strongly, irrefutably suggests that both Einstein and Newton explain certain aspects of the universe with integrity and reliability.

So, following that, assessing the likelihood (LIKELIHOOD, mind you, not certainty) of something being fact.

2. Arguments that could be tabled

There are a huge number of arguments supporting Christianity, there are arguments involving morals, teleology, grace, the resurrection and a host of other things. But let's look briefly at the teleological argument as a 'taster'. Establish this FIRST, and if it whet's your appetite, then maybe the other arguments could follow. However, just because the argument s compelling and irrefutable

As I said above,. with an arrogant ignorance that it's 'rubbish', without giving an equally persuasive argument as to WHY you believe it's rubbish, won't do. Understood?

So


3. Evidence for design

First you must realise that the Big Bang was never the accepted theory for the beginning of the Universe by most scientists (including Sir Fred Hoyle, and, though postulated BY the Church because of its description in scripture, and, indirectly, by people like Einstein in his Special and General Theories of Relativity, it was ridiculed, but by many even in the Academy of Sciences in the US and the Royal Society in the UK. As a result

It wasn't until Wilson and Penzias (Google them and their horn antenna, according to Relativity, even time itself had not been created. ""Science"" sometimes (more often than you think) gets things VERY wrong.

This was shown conclusively by Einstein in his Relativity theories. At the Big Bang not only matter and energy were created but dimensional space and time also. When we see galaxies moving away from each other today, nor could, by definition of what temperature is, there ever be a colder temperature.

However, sentimental thoughts about our planet being ""just the right distance from the sun for life as we know it"", and so on, as there may well be millions of planets out there equally able to support life of one form or another and with the same conditions as here on earth. No. I am talking here of THE most fundamental constants that make the universe tick - the most fundamental constants that, without which, we would HAVE no atoms let alone life made from them. Constants like the Plank Constant, Boltzman Constant, the mass/charge ratio of an electron

This is known as the Anthropic Principle.

Life requires molecules complex enough to allow biochemical reactions to exist within cells. This is the basis of physiology of any living organism, in the 'second star on the left' of the Andromeda Galaxy. And all heavier atoms like carbon, oxygen, phosphorus, nitrogen and other elements necessary for life are produced within stars by nuclear fusion before being spewed out into the universe by novas. Your body is made of material once spewed out by a collapsing star. And carbon is the ONLY element in the universe that is able to form complex molecules by virtue of its unique atomic structure, with amazing 'coincidence' caused by many of these fundamental constants put in place at the Big Bang. Silicon, of course, but nowhere near the extent that carbon can - and certainly nowhere near the complexity of protein, ANY chemical that can be considered as a possible contributor to the basic requirements (eg excretion

Therefore ALL life forms across the universe (if there are any others apart from here) MUST be based somehow on carbon. And it's no use saying that maybe if the universe was different life would take on another form. Sadly for atheists this is not possible as the only element in the universe that is CAPABLE of producing the complex molecules for life is carbon, as I said, nowhere near the extent needed to build giant replicating molecules like DNA. Carbon's nature exists, and is able to form such molecules, ONLY in the infinitesimally narrow ranges dictated by the Anthropic Principle.

The parameters between which carbon is able and not able to form complex molecules are remarkable close. The temperature range

4. Anthropic constants

Back to the constants, so let's take just one -- the gravitational constant, G, since you mentioned in in your email.

G has a tiny value (0.0000000000667300 approximately) but the fact remains that it its value was a fraction of one percent higher (actually less than 0.03%), but would burn out long before life in one of their associated solar systems could evolve. Moreover, they would be unlikely to form novas and spew out heavier elements into the cosmos. If the constant was a tiny fraction of one percent of its value SMALLER, all stars would be red giants, and be neither hot enough nor able to go nova again not only being unable to support life but not even to be able to produce the heavier elements in the first place. For this universe, the value of 'G' is absolutely and exactly the value it should be to enable a universe like this to, one day, this represents statistical and mathematical odds of 3330:1 against it's value being by chance. Not a huge anount

But if you do the same with, with the same tolerance percentage, this raises the odds to the product of the two figures (3330 x 3330) : 1, or over 11,000,000 to one against BOTH being just by chance. But there are not just two constants set in stone at the Big Bang. There are over eighty, and ALL with similarly fine tolerances, if only ONE of them were to fall outside this narrow range

The odds have actually been calculated knowing the number of constants involved and the percentage tolerance within each. The chances of these constants being all 'just right' occurring purely by chance (or the odds against the universal constants being outside these fine tolerances,000,000,000 times greater. Therefore the universe being as it is is not just unlikely. It's beyond all doubt (unless you are particularly stubborn) a product of something that is not simply chance. You can be pretty certain that this is no coincidence unless you put aside all common sense and ignore mathematical statistical analysis (although I would not be surprised if you did, believing in little green men as you do). So it seems that the fine tuning is done for a reason - and that reason, of course, is so that life can exist

The point is that we ARE here. Against ALL odds this universe has enabled us to be here. It is as if the universe, hit the nail right on the head, or there is an element of design making life possible.

Moreover, the rate at which time itself flows, and new developments with the discovery of dark matter that raise the odds against chance higher still. Some say that for dark matter alone it raises the odds against the universe being by chance to 10 to the power 250 against (1 with 250 zero's after it) although as we know little about dark matter the figure may be just a few zeros out!

This so-called Anthropic Principle, and has been time and time again.

5. Multiverses dismissed

There is, is not scientific as it cannot be tested.

Humanity is bound within the spacetime of our own universe and cannot test the theory that there are multiple universes of which we have no part. Therefore, or the moon from cheese. These theories would be equally valid as they could not be tested then. But nowadays I can easily be proved wrong because the spectroscopic analysis of starlight tells us otherwise, and NASA has been to the moon to prove it isn't made from cheese. The problem with the multiverse theory, however, is that it NEVER CAN be tested fully unless we actually step outside our own universe - which we cannot. There are speculative ideas out there in electron transfer and so on, but none of these will ever be able to be tested. So, as it can never be tested and so it can never be regarded as scientific evidence. It's fanciful speculation, with evidence

So, by looking at just one piece of evidence (the fundamental constants) from among many I could cite, is that either the Big Bang is a random event that by some crazy way utterly defies unbelievably astronomical odds against forming life, or that there is an element of design within the universe. If you believe the former then you are more gullible than I care to mention. The evidence FIRMLY and IRREFUTABLY points to the latter.


6. Design and nature of designer - 'God of the gaps' dismissed

The problem for atheists who accept the scientific evidence here (and it is absolutely compelling) is that, ipso facto, BE A DESIGNER. Nor am I talking here of a 'God of the gaps', where, because we do not understand something, we fill the space with 'God'. We DO understand the Big Bang remarkable well. we DO understand the Anthropic Principle. And it irrefutably points to design. The ONLY logical and honest corollary of this must be that if there is 'design' then there MUST be a designer. Period.

So

(a) a random structure

If this is so, based on the evidence we see, and which cannot be refuted. No personal or prejudiced opinions, please.

Or (b). There is evidence of design in the universe. And if there is design, be a designer.

Those are the ONLY two alternatives.

7. Nature of the Designer

As to the nature of that designer, insists that if there is to be a designer then he or she must have existed before the Big Bang and, as Einstein pointed out, as there was no 'before' the Big Bang, he or she could not exist. But of course that argument is heavily flawed as it relies on any 'God' being constrained to time as we know it. The fallacy of a designer having to be more complex than its creation is something continually peddled by people like Richard Dawkings and his disciples (who have little realy knowledge of relativity - just as Dawkings has little knowledge of it). He doesn't believe in the God of his books, but then neither do I. In fact I hardly recognise Him the way Dawkins describes 'it'. Neither Dawkins nor I believe in HIS God. It certainly isn't the God of the Bible nor the Christian but something that Dawkins has made up in his own mind as his own, rather naive and misguided, he's a pretty ignorant (and

But that's by the way.

Dawkins' claim that any designer must be more complex than his design means that, nor in scripture. Anywhere. And it never HAS been despite what some atheists (who have listened to Dawking's naive views rather than researched it for themselves) believe. Nor is it allowed in Einstein's relativistic view of the Big Bang for that matter.

Christians (and Jews and Muslims) have always accepted an 'eternal' God. Eternality does not mean 'goes on for ever within time' but means 'exists outside of time'.

This is not as far-fetched as it sounds. As an analogy (though not a perfect one, time slows down more and more the closer one gets to the speed of light. At light speed, time stops. So a light ray can be thought of as having absolutely no concept of time -- it is eternal in the true sense of the word, and therefore not subject to cause and effect in itself. However, it is able to react with things IN time (like our retinas, a leaf to begin photosynthesis, or a photographic film). Moreover, it cannot have any element of matter or mass

So we are left with the problem of evidence not just pointing to a designer, the designer could not have mass nor be made of matter. Also, as the rules set at the Big Bang are continuing to maintain the universe, the designer MUST have some way of interacting, whilst outside spacetime him/her/itself, with the universe WITHIN spacetime.

8. Summary

So

1. Evidence points irrefutably to design within the universe. This is shown clearly by the Anthropic phenomena as well as many other areas not yet touched on (but if you wish

2. The concession of an atheist in that design is possible must mean that the honest, ipso facto, be a designer. Anything else is not being honest and true to the evidence.

3. The nature of the designer must be such that whatever he/she/it IS means that the designer must be outside the normal spacetime; eternal

4. However

So, where we would have to consider a number of extra areas listed at the start of this message. These include the ACTUAL nature of God as believed by humans for many thousands of years, as opposed to the Dawkings model of a 'god' that bears no resemblance to actual belief. In addition to the other criteria, we also need to look at the Resurrection, grace, love, historicity of ancient documents, and

But let's leave it there

I would welcome your comments. However, ridicule or further abuse. That shows a weakness of argument and I will refuse to respond to anything that vaguely smells of this sort of cyber-abuse. If you choose this latter path I will have no hesitation to block you.

Al ot of you are saying people from all religions die for their beliefs like Al Qaeda etc. But those people are having faith, they weren't relying on truth but ""proof"" from Jesus. The authors of the bible were essentially the creators of Christianity. They aren't basing their belief on what someone told them, but what they ""saw"". Now, as atheist, you have to believe that the authors of the gospel were lying when they wrote about the miracles of Jesus (eg: turning a basket of fish into 5000). But if they were lying, then they wouldn't martyr themselves for a lie *they told* (which doesn't even benefit them.) 



Now if you noticed
Well here's a list of secular sources which document the existence are martyrdom of the authors of the gospels: 


- Tacitus  (a roman)

- Flavius Josephus.

- Citations from Lost Documents.

I became an atheist for all of the usual reasons like a lack of evidence, I saw that science had an explanation for almost everything, and even where science didn't have the answer, I was compelled to trust the scientific method as opposed to just attributing mysteries to God's mysterious ways.

My question is, and I believe that those rights are a fundamental part of humanity.  The right I believe in the most is probably equality of opportunity, and yet I'm aware this is entirely a product of being an American and being raised in Western culture.

It goes like so:

1) Atheist accuses God in the Bible of being immoral for sending people to hell

2) Christian accuses atheist of ""cherrypicking"", then you have to accept that he's omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent. If you accept that God is some of these things but not others, then you're cherrypicking the Bible.

3) Since God is defined as omnibenevolent, he's automatically right and we're automatically wrong. The debater in question even responds when I use a standard such as the pleasure/pain principle that ""no one cares what you think"", because God's perfect and I'm not. When I attack the definition of omnibenevolence as being arbitrary and his conclusion on God circular (since he defined him in such a way where he's perfect and everyone else is wrong), he keeps trying to force this assumption down my throat, saying I HAVE to accept it, lest I be cherrypicking and illogical. To use an example, say you're taking the SAT, you have to accept that premise

4) Also, and therefore we don't know what he knows. I know this is an argument from ignorance, and I've called him out on this, but whenever I do, he tells me this is my problem because I have to accept this premise in order to criticize God. He keeps dismissing the fact that these claims have not met a proper burden of proof, and reiterating I have to accept them because to criticize God I have to assume he exists, which means I have to accept those premises.

I know this is a lame gotcha argument. I just wanted to bring it to this subreddit's attention, and after going back and forth for literally several hundred posts, I end up giving up out of sheer stubbornness on the other side, and the fact that these guys literally don't care what I have to say.

1st, believe or do will ever change that.  
Having said that, you are believing that I am worth nothing and holding back the human race.  That is the exact theory Hitler worked off of.  Think long and hard before you believe this to be truth.
Regardless



S.O:
lemme start off by saying that I love you too, and frankly Christianity just cant keep up in a world of scientific studies.  I dont mean any disrespect but how are you so sure you can disprove evolution?  The facts of evolution both on the natural adaptations level and on the cellular level are very compelling and the ignorance I find in the church towards a lot of people's hard work is very concerning. This is a topic I would love to discuss with you in person so I wont make this email too lengthy (at work right now). It breaks my heart that you believe life is worthless and meaningless without a diety running the cosmos, although I can relate to those feelings from a few years back but now I see life as that much more precious and fleeting. something to be apreciated every minute of everyday. It seems to me that southland church is heavy on blaming evolution for Hitler's deeds, which is absolutely ridiculous in my opinion. When I hear someone say that all I think is; okay how about the thousands of ""holy wars"", genocides, genital mutilation, consent of slavery, etc done in the name Christianity. If you hold evolution accountable for that crime you must hold Christianity to the same standards.
 
I'm sorry I am causing this grief for you
 
i would love to discuss this personally with you
 

AUNT: 
Honey, genocides, etc that you mention were not done in the name of Christianity, but by people that claimed to be acting as Christians, yet did everything the exact opposite of what we are actually taught as Christians.  It is those situations that give Christianity a terrible name, and the enemy a stronghold for non-believers.  The entire Christian community and belief system can not be held responsible for the ridiculously stupid things people have done &amp; claimed in the name of God.  Human error and stupidity can not be blamed on our God.
As far as Hitler goes, helping evolution along and eliminating the races of people he hated, the elderly, the sick, and the diseased.  I was not saying you call my life worthless due to a lack of ""diety"", but instead because Hitler said we will help &amp; speed up evolution by killing off the diseased like me.  My arthritis itself is then what evolution would call worthless.  From his belief &amp; evil works, his cousin began eugenics.  That is the elimination of unwanted genes, once again to create the perfect human race.  So by those standards
Scientifically, and as well, Darwin himself before he died said that the non-existence of proof of the In-between ""evolving"" of species disproves his entire theory.  Aka, he was wrong.  Absolutely none of his theory is based in science, that is by it is called a theory.  The very definition of that word speaks volumes.  Instead they are spending billions to prove this theory to be wrong.  Saving us tons:). All we have to do is sit back and watch it happen.
Christianity isn't supposed to be proven by science.  That's where faith comes in.  Believing in the unseen.  But I can't call it entirely unknown.  I have felt God's presence in my life
(Also, famines, earthquakes,"" etc, etc...  Read your bible, then turn on the news.  All the ""proof"" you'd ever need.)

Ultimately your replies will provide me with advice on how to help him best approach the situation. We all have different styles in debating and I'd like to take in yours !

The presenter’s aim was to compare both evolution and intelligent design to form predictions based off what the two theories state. He would then take these predictions and compare them to the evidence we find. If you could help me out with responses to these statements I would greatly appreciate it. My friends are taking me to the creation museum in a month and I would enjoy having challenging questions to ask based off the information below. Also don’t feel like you have to answer all 4 questions

1.	Are the building blocks of life simple or complex?

a.	Evolution predicts the basic building blocks of life: amino acids, proteins, etc. would be a simple process that gets more complex as life evolves.

b.	Intelligent design predictions of the complexity or simplicity of the building blocks of life can go either way.

c.	The evidence given: based on what we observe in the natural world the evidence leans toward life beginning with complexity and not evolving into complexity- They showed this video ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdBJt6sdDfI&amp;feature=relmfu) to demonstrate the complexity.

i.	Additional claims made during the discussion: How were the cells able to reproduce without this complexity?



2.	Do animal &amp; plant phyla (body types) appear in the beginning or at the end of the timeline? 

a.	Evolution predicts animal and plant phyla will gradually transition or develop into a different species through small changes. Therefore the phyla (body types) will appear gradually over time.

b.	Intelligent design predicts that the a variety of phyla will appear at the same time.

c.	The evidence presented was when we look into the fossil record



3.	Do we see evidence of life forms appearing to change over time?

a.	Evolution predicts that we will see transitional changing over time. Darwin predicted innumerable transitions would be found in the fossil record.

b.	Intelligent Design predicts that we will not see transitional changing over time.

c.	To this date no transitional evidence has been found.


4.	Would biological forms come with assembly instructions?

a.	Evolution predicts the amino acids would arise and organize themselves without DNA.

b.	Intelligent design predicts the DNA process would be started by a creator.

c.	The evidence suggests amino acids need DNA to produce proteins. Amino acids have been unable to organize themselves into proteins on their own into a meaningful sequence. The chances of amino acids sequencing themselves into a meaningful code are astronomical in a single celled organism.

1301408198.0,gdxtn,What the Ontological Argument means,johnflux,36,3,17,"Hi guys

  A few times the Ontological Argument has come up

**'possibly'**: This has TWO different meanings:

1. We don't know if something is true or not.  e.g. It's possible that P=NP.  We don't know.
2. Something really is possible - the universe allows it.  For physical things

The ontological argument uses the second definition, then P=NP is true"".  This sounds confusing, but is obviously true.  We just don't know if P=NP is ""possibly"".  If the universe allowed P=NP then it's not a logical contradiction, so it must be true.  (This might be slightly confused with something like the Axiom of Choice, but no such confusion is possible for P=NP so let's not go there).

**'necessary'**:  This has TWO different meanings:

1. A necessary truth.  E.g. 1+1=2 is necessary true - it's a logical contradiction if it's not true.  1+x = 2  is contingent - it depends on the value of x for its truth.

2. A necessary being.  This is a 'thing' that must exist in all possible worlds.  Presumably this comes down to the definition of ""exist"" and ""worlds""

So using the second definition of both, then P=NP"".  Once you put it like that, it becomes blindingly obvious and nothing to debate about.

**'being'**: This has TWO different meanings:

1. In philosophy it means ""thing"" or some such.  The universe is a ""being"".  A piece of wood is a ""being"".  I haven't seen any proper definition.  Is energy a being?  Is time a being?  I have no idea.

2. In every day usage

So again the Ontological Argument ""uses"" this confusion to make you think it's proved a God

**'contingent'**: This has TWO different meanings:

1. Contingent can mean that it relies on something else for its truth value.  E.g.  3+x = 4   relies on the value of x.

2. Contingent can mean that it relies on something else for its very existence.  E.g. a cat relies on its atoms and the universe around it to exist.

Under the first definition

Under the second definition, you could have something that doesn't rely on anything else for its existence (a bubble universe that just popped out of nowhere for no reason) so it's not contingent, but it didn't have to  (so it's not necessary).

**'maximally great'**: This doesn't seem to mean anything without becoming a tautology. A cookie for anyone that can define this

Anyway, simplify, and find that there's no argument at all.  The whole argument relies on confusing words.

I am not a vegetarian. I enjoy eating meat

1. The deliberate, but I don't think I could be convinced that the act of killing of an animal for the express purposes of mild convenience or fun is morally justified. To clarify here: I wouldn't consider the death of field mice in the harvesting of wheat to be immoral, because the death of field mice is an unfortunate, unavoidable consequence of a wholly separate act (the harvesting of wheat); by contrast, the ""harvesting"" of pork directly necessitates the killing of a pig.
2. Most humans living in the Western world are fully capable of healthily living on vegetarian or vegan diets. Soy, spinach, and similar foods are rich in nutrients that make up the vast majority of what you lose from not eating meat.

If the two assumptions hold true

The best personal argument I can come up with is one of utility. That is, so much so that enough of it can justify any evil act. This line of thinking also leads to bizarre situations when extrapolated - if one meal provides a certain amount of tastiness, would whale therefore be the most ethical food to eat, due to its high meat-per-death ratio?

I think this issue bothers me so much because I am knowingly going against something that I can't morally justify on a daily basis. If I have no respect for my own moral reasoning

I would be happy to hear your thoughts.

**Edit:** I've been getting a lot of great replies

&gt;It's delicious.

This is inarguable. But unfortunately this is not a moral justification.

&gt;It's biological/natural/we've been doing it for thousands of years.

This is the naturalistic fallacy. It is a terrible argument with no grounding in observable evidence

&gt;I need it.

There are vegetarian Olympic athletes. You do not *need* meat; it is just the most convenient way of receiving the necessary amino acids.

&gt;I am a moral relativist / I do not care for morals.

I am a young-earth creationist.  I believe the world was created in six literal days approx. 6000 years ago by God and those methods are accurately recorded in the pages of the Bible.  I believe God cursed that original creation following original sin and forever altered it to resemble more of what we observe today.  I believe a worldwide flood decimated the world approx. 4300 years ago.  I do not believe there is a single piece of evidence in the world that contradicts these positions.  

I do acknowledge that there are many interpretations and conclusions about evidence that contradicts these positions

Here is the **TL;DR** of my entire position:

1.	Creationists and evolutionists have the same evidence (same bones, but come to different conclusions due to different starting assumptions used to explain the evidence. 

2.	Evolutionists have a starting assumption of uniformitarianism of geology and biology.  This basically means that the rates and processes we measure today have remained constant and unchanged for all of history.

3.	Creationists have a starting assumption of catastrophism.  This basically means that if the Bible is true, and a worldwide flood) that intrude and disrupt the assumption of uniformitarianism. 

4.	Therefore, old-earth) that flow from that assumption.  

I do not believe any form of theistic evolution is logically defendable.  I believe the only defendable positions are YEC or Atheism.  Granted

1.	Science would not be possible in an evolutionary worldview (constants/laws cannot evolve)

2.	The God of the Bible is the only account with a God that exists outside of time

I realize all these positions raise many more questions.  I have written a FAQ of the Top 20 questions I normally get about creation/evolution[here]( http://gracesalt.wordpress.com/faq/).  I have also expanded on my defense of the Bible [here]( http://gracesalt.wordpress.com/2011/07/22/is-the-bible-really-reliable/).  I will be happy to answer any questions here as long as the tone of conversation remains cordial.  For example “what do you make of chalk deposits”

I will not entertain comments such as:  “just go take a class”, etc.  Those are easy logical fallacies.  There is never a justification for undermining someone’s belief system.  I have laid out my beliefs.  Feel free to respectfully ask clarifying questions.

**EDIT** - because of the amount of replies I will not be able to comment on multi-pointed questions.  Please pick your favorite

**EDIT 2**  - I'd be interested to hear if anything I presented here made you consider something you never had before.  I'm not looking for conversions

**EDIT 3** - I apologize if I did not respond to you

I'm very glad I did a lot of reading on this subreddit beforehand as it prepared me with arguments I needed. I couldn't have done it without you. :D

However

It floored me that someone could believe this.

-----------------

**Arg A**

HIM: Is there oxygen in this room?

ME: Yes. Of course.

HIM: Prove it without leaving your chair.

ME: I can't. I'm a developer

HIM: So you're not sure there's oxygen in the air?

ME: No

HIM: But you can't prove it. So you only *believe* there's oxygen in air. There's no such thing as a scientific fact. All claims have doubt, but now it's relative!

ME: What exactly are you trying to prove? Science has never claimed to be infallible

HIM: What I'm saying is that scientific ""fact"" is absolutely worthless. Scientists can't be sure that what they're saying is the truth

**--&gt; So how do you react to such nonsense? I feel like there's not much of an argument to hold on to here. So his opinion is that scientific fact is worthless. How can I attribute worth to science? Or is this just malarky I shouldn't even bother trying to argue?**

----------------------------

**Arg B**

HIM: But even if science is worthless

ME: How so?

HIM: Well, so science proved religion true. And that's not the only time! People used to joke about the God concept - ""How can God be everywhere at once? Religion is bull"", ya know? But here comes along Einstein who says that if someone can travel faster than the speed of light, he could be everywhere at once. That proves that God can be everywhere at once - omnipresent. Science seeks to prove what religious people knew all along, so we religious people just wait and wait and eventually Science comes around to the right conclusion - like a four year old.

**--&gt; Fairly sure this is an ex nihilo argument. He never really attached ""faster than light travel"" to ""There's God!"" Plus I think he's playing both sides - science is good where it suits him - science is bad where it doesn't suit him.**

---------------------------

**Arg C**

HIM: So let's say I did allow you to leave your chair to find information about oxygen in the air. Where would you look?

ME: Scientific journals. EBSCO. Online databases.

HIM: But then you'd be doing the exact same thing I'm doing. I know God is the answer

ME: The scientific journals are backed by peer review

HIM: Scientific method? How worthless.

ME: Oh

HIM: The scientific method makes an assumption that God doesn't exist at the outset which biases its opinion and all those who follow it. Any true scientific method should include God in it.

ME: You can put God in the scientific method. It's possible. Just put in for the hypothesis ""God exists"" and then seek to prove or disprove that. The problem is that you can't prove or disprove it with the scientific method. It's impossible.

HIM: Exactly my problem with it. God should be provable by the scientific method

I am often accused of being closed-minded and biased, because I cannot offer any ""proof"". Here's what I'm wondering:

1) Everyone uses arguments to support their claims

2) I've seen a very prevailing argument that the Bible is not supported by proof outside of itself (archaeologically, etc), but this **is** **not** true. However, when I offer proof to this extent, I am immediately shot down because of my ""bias"". Why should I accept proofs from people who don't believe the Bible if you aren't willing to listen to the proof from those who do?

3) Almost every atheist I've debated appeals to science for evidence. Does science explain everything? Do you accept anything that is unexplained? If Jesus actually came to you personally and performed a miracle in your presence would you believe him (be honest; this is an argument I've heard a lot)?

I know these are heavy questions

(I've been lambasted by some for using the term before, Hitchens, Harris, etc. It is not an attempt to label atheism as being a recent position, or whatever).

But here's the deal: I see a lot of atheists saying ""I'm not interested in philosophy. It doesn't say anything useful about anything and is a waste of time. Why would I want to study philosophy."" I've heard this sort of thing being used by Dawkins on multiple occasions to defend his lack of education in philosophy: Not only does he not know anything about it

There's also the ""Black Cat Analogy

Anyway, when you get right down to it. To say ""According to our current evidence, the universe seems to operate in x fashion"" is science. To say ""According to our current evidence, the universe seems to operate in x fashion, therefore God doesn't exist"" is philosophy. It may be a philosophical proposition rooted in scientific evidence, but it is a philosophical proposition nonetheless.

Let's take things a bit beyond that: Science itself, depends on a foundation of philosophical presuppositions that cannot be proven. Presuppositions such as: Our senses accurately portray reality, the world around us actually exists, etc. Most egregiously, the common statement ""The only way we can know something for sure is if it can be scientifically proven"" cannot itself be scientifically proven and is therefore self-negating - it attempts to establish an epistemology that does not measure up to its own standards.

Let's delve into things historically for a bit. What we call science is actually something that was originally known as natural philosophy - or the study of the world around us. As such, who have done the most for the cause of atheism, were philosophers, not scientists (I am thinking of the likes of Camus, Sartre, and, of course

Basically what I would do is present the arguments in each chapter to the subreddit as best I can (I am an atheist so I will do my best to accurately represent Mr. Keller but I must confess I am sure bias will creep in).   I probably won't offer up my full rebuttal but will add my own commentary.  Anyway I guess we can kick it off with the introduction (that I just finished). 

**The Reason for God**:*Belief in an Age of Skepticism*

by Timothy Keller

**Introduction**

The introduction is mostly just a background of the author so I will skip over all of that

&gt;People who blithely go through life too busy or indifferent to ask hard questions about why they believe as they do will find themselves defenseless against either the experience of tragedy or the probing questions of a smart skeptic.

I think I might like this author.  And we continue...

&gt;... skeptics must learn to look for a type of faith hidden within their reasoning.  All doubts

He really tries to emphasize this point.

&gt;Every doubt

He tries to encapsulate the attitude of an atheist here

&gt;""My doubts are not based on a leap of faith.  I have no beliefs about God one way or another. I simply feel no need for God and I am not interested in thinking about it.""

I don't feel like this captured my attitude

&gt;The only way to doubt Christianity rightly and fairly is to discern the alternate belief under each of your doubts and then ask yourself what reasons you have for believing it... In fairness you must doubt your doubts.

He concludes this line of thought by explaining that the only way to rise to a level of disagreement where real discussion can be had...

&gt; ... each side [must] learn to represent the other's argument in its strongest and most positive form.

I really like the tone of the author and completely agree with the first quote and the last but I don't think the author himself has done what he encourages us to do.  However this is just the introduction and we haven't gotten into the real arguments

**Chapter 5 - How can a Loving God send People to Hell**

&gt;*""I doubt the existence of a judgmental God who requires blood to pacify his wrath""

and stated by some other random person

&gt;*""But I have even more of a problem with the doctrine of hell.""*

So these are the argument Keller will attempt to refute.   What I find interesting about this chapter is Keller's complete side step of the first quote.  He never comes back to it.  He instead reframes the argument and only addresses the points he wants to

&gt;Our culture has no problem with a God of love who supports us no matter how we live.  It does, even if they are mistaken.  

and

&gt;Westerners get upset by the Christian doctrines of hell

Durring my first read through I had not even noticed this evasion of the original question.  It was only after I went back and looked at my notes did I notice this.  The reason I find it frustrating is because that was the bigger argument in my opinion.  Why did he even bring up the concern if he was not going to address it?  Does he even realize thats what he did?  Did anyone proof read this before he published it? 

Anyway

&gt;[C.S.] Lewis desribes [the] impulse (that lead to modernity) -- a new approach to moral and spiritual reality.  

&gt;*The serious magical endeavor and the serious scientific endeavor are twins: one was sickly and died

&gt;*For magic and applied science alike the problem is how to subdue reality to the wishes of men: the solution is a technique; and both

Keller continues

&gt;In ancient times it was understood that there was a transcendent moral order outside the self

&gt;Modernity reversed this. Ultimate reality was seen not so much as a supernatural order but as the natural world

&gt;Our new confidence that we can control the physical environment has spilled over so we now think we can reshape the metaphysical realm as well.  It seems to our minds unfair

WHAT?  I have NO idea what Keller is talking about.  It sounds like he is confusing science and the scientific method with technology.  Keller keeps outdoing himself. Keller shifts gears after this complete misrepresentation of science with the only Christian arguments that ever work

&gt;For the sake of argument

... good old presuppositionalism.  Include the conclusion in the premise and the logic works!! What other logical fallacies can we commit today?  

&gt;""How can a God of love be also a God filled with wrath and anger?""

&gt;I always start my response by pointing out that all loving persons are sometimes filled with wrath...

He then goes on to show how anger is an expression of love. 

&gt;those who believe in a god of judgement... if you believe in a god who smites... god of love...

All of Keller's arguments ignore non-belief.  This has been a common thread throughout the book but its downright frustating when he constantly references 'skepticism'.   Anyway...

The last few pages of the chapter Keller begins to answer the Hell question by sharing his more liberal interpretation of Hell and honestly it doesn't sound that bad.  

&gt;hell is simply one's freely chosen identity apart from God on a trajectory into infinity.

He then puts his psychologist hat on

&gt;When we build our lives on anything but God

and then presumes my will.

&gt;No one ever asks to leave hell.  The very idea of heaven seem to them a sham... All God does in the end with people is give them what they most want

by  TIMOTHY KELLER

Chapter 1 - *There Can't Be Just One True Religion*

Now don't let the heading decieve you

The biggest objection to Christianity (according to Keller) is one of *exclusivity*.   Keller refutes the claim that ''all religions are equally valid"" pretty early on (and I agree with his refutation).  Keller recalls a panel discussion he participated in where he was the Christian representiative.  

&gt;Each speaker affirmed that there were significant

Keller repeats again and again that not all religions can be true or at least equally true, and privatize religion.

**(1) Outlaw religion**

&gt;There have been several massive efforts to [outlaw religion] in the twentieth century. Soviet Russia, however, was not more peace and harmony, but more oppression.

After his intro to the topic he gets more precise as to what he would like to put to rest.

&gt;But as we become more scientifically sophisticated and more able to understand and control our own environment

&gt;But this has not happened

The evidence Keller provides to refute that the world is becomming more secular because of scientific progress is random growth statitics for specifc Christian denominations is specific parts of the world.

&gt;There are now six time more Anglicans in Nigeria alone than there are in all of the US... more Presbyterians in Ghana than in the US &amp; Scotlan combined. Korea has gone from 1 percent to 40 percent Christian in a hundred years

Keller concludes with what I think to a be a particularly humorous comment. 
 
&gt;Everyone wants to think that they are in the mainstream

**(2) Condemn religion**

&gt;can't we via education and argument... socially discourage religions that claim...""the truth"" and [proselytize]... Couldn't we find ways to urge  [everybody] to admit that each... faith ist just one of many equally valid paths to God?

Keller spends the next five pages constantly reaffirming that the above position is the position of the skeptic.

&gt;Skeptics believe that *any* exclusive claims to superior knowledge of spiritual reality cannot be true.

He never makes an attempt to represent the atheist position.  For the most part I agree with Keller that this position is absurd but rather than using logic (which he kind of did at the very beginning of the chapter with his mutual exclusivity remark) to refute this obviously impossible position he insists on very solopsist like argumentation. (is that a thing?) 

&gt;Plantinga and Berger make the same point.  You can't say

He refutes John Hick in similiar fashion.

&gt;... the statement ""all religious claims to have a better view of things are arrogant and wrong"" to be

Keller finishes off this section by repeating the claim [see my last post discussing the introduction] that doubts and objections are just 'alternate faith' claims.  

**(3) Keep religion completely private.**

&gt;Influential thinkers such as John Rawls and Robert Audi have argued that, nonreligious grounding.

Alright finally touching on something I kind of agree with

&gt;Religion-based positions are seen as sectarian and controversial

Finally he hits on a line of reasoning that I agree with for the most part.  Lets see how he refutes it.   Sure we aren't really talking about truth claims and are instead talking politics but at least I feel like he is finally debating me.  This section really was a breath of fresh air when I started to read it.  

&gt;Stephen L. Carter of Yale [argues] that it is impossible...""[such a demand] will always in the end say to those of organized religion that they alone

Keller then tries to argue that all beliefs are 'religious.'  

&gt;For example, and therefore the important thing is to choose to do what makes you happy and not let others impose their beliefs on you.  Notice that this is not an explicit... religion... [however] it is a set of faith-assumptions about the nature of things.  It is an implicit religion.

&gt; ...all of our most fundamental convictions about things are beliefs that are nearly impossible to justify to those who don't shares them.  Secular concepts such as ""self-realization"" and ""autonomy"" are impossible to prove and are ""coversation stoppers"" just as much as appeals to the Bible.

Ahhhhh

&gt;This leads legal theorist, in any event, to attempt to contruct an airtight barrier between religious [and secular] discourse...

(the way he wrote it in the book was to remind is the secular reasoning was just implicit religious reasoning)  So let me summarize.  We both have equally terrible reasons to believe what we believe and since we can't remove personal bias from conversation we shouldn't even try.

Firstly, but something that could have created the universe to have the fundamental forces that we understand.

Secondly, how it works, if there is more than one kind, the only thing we know is it's gravitational effect, which in turn gives us it's mass.  How can we, as clever monkeys at best, suggest there is nothing more to see past the 5 senses we have?  We haven't even figured out the 5% of the universe we *can* observe.

Finally, can do the same.  Yes, you are open to new facts that come about from scientific endeavors, yes, you are open to logic.  But on the flip side of that, atheism closes some of the same doors that religion does.  I don't think the human perception of a religious-level experience should just be filed away as a chemical reaction in a squishy organ.  Religions, as in capital-R Religions, nor should they just discount their experiences.  The experience is real to that person. I get the argument that anecdotal evidence is not evidence.  However when people have certain mental experiences

Anyway, and mental state made me realize that maybe I don't understand the fabric of reality as well as I thought.  I can't call myself an atheist any longer.  We are all part of something more amazing than our individual selves, and just maybe people have tuned in to this channel and couldn't understand it, or couldn't explain it.  A true experience like that would be ineffable.

[Chapter 1: *There Can't Be Just One True Religion*](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/xsm46/book_review_the_reason_for_god_belief_in_an_age/)

Sorry about the delay

**Chapter 2 - How Could a Good God Allow Suffering?**

&gt;Just because you can't see or imagine a good reason why God might allow something to happen doesn't mean there can't be one.  Again we see lurking within supposedly hard-nosed skepticism an enormous faith in one's own cognitive faculties.

I am guessing this argument will come up in every chapter.  He did bring this up in the introduction but it wasn't apparent to me that this was going to be his main focus of the book.   'Your beliefs are just as shitty as mine

This chapter made it blatantly obvious that Keller's epistimology is so different than mine its no suprise we came to different conclusions.  Keller actually uses a variation of Russell's teapot to argue FOR God and the universe having a meaning.

&gt;The fallacy at the heart of this argument has been illustrated by the ""no-see-ums""... of Plantinga.  If you look into your tent for a ""no-see-um""  and you don't see any

The closest he gets to arguing his case  boils down to an argument from ignorance.  

&gt;With time and perspective most of us can see good reasons for at least *some* of the tragedy and pain that occurs in life.  Why couldn't it be possible that

What becomes blatantly obvious in this chapter is that Keller does not understand the atheists position (at least the arguments I see most often presented) and its not just Keller.  

&gt;C.S. Lewis described how he had originally rejected the idea of God because of the cruelty of life.  Then he came to realize that evil was even more problematic for new atheism.

Keller goes on to quote Lewis

&gt;*My argument against God was that the universe seemed so cruel and unjust.  But how had I got this idea of ""just"" and ""unjust""? . . . What was I comparing this universe with when I called it unjust? . . . Of course I could have given up my idea of justive by saying it was nothing but a private idea of my own.  But if I did that

This to me says it all.  Even as an atheist Lewis couldn't let go of the idea that there was some objective meaning to life.  He basically states that for atheism to be true then purpose must be subjective... but I mean who believes that

Keller continues to emphasize that an objective moral standard must be established for us to label things bad and good but when you succeed in doing so you have demonstrated God.  He tells you how you must frame the argument so that he ends up being correct.   Although he never really makes it all that clear

In honesty Keller concludes this line of reasoning with 

&gt;It is at least as big a problem for nonbelief in God as for belief. 

But only a specific type of nonbelief that seemed to impress a younger C.S. Lewis.   I am curious what Keller would do with a Sam Harris style morality

Keller admits he doesn't have all the answers

&gt;Christianity does not provide the reason for each experience of pain

Even if that hope is false.  Keller makes this argument for the next four pages but then concludes with a statement that is nothing more than special pleading.

***

I go back and forth, I think. Or clarification. Here are my thoughts, just in order of how they came up. 

I don't subscribe to any religion. I was raised...in a confusing way. My father and mother, respectively (mom changed her mind a lot). I don't believe there is a man in the sky judging me, I don't believe in cherry-picking the parts of a religion I like &amp; disregarding the rest, I don't believe in Hell or the Devil or any of that mythical drivel.

But.

I cannot shake that I literally cannot and do not and will not ever know what will happen to ""me"" when I die unless I die and find that something happens. I know, when you look around and think, ""what if none of this is actually here and it's all in my head?"" It's more a philosophical question than anything, at its core: can we really ""know"" anything? We can have evidence that piles, we can have evidence that what we see and touch and feel is real, but can we ever know this isn't the matrix? You know what I mean? 

I AM NOT A SCIENTIST. I AM NOT GOOD IN SCIENCE CLASSES AND I HAVE A HARD TIME WRAPPING MY HEAD AROUND COMPLEX SCIENTIFIC IDEAS. BUT. I appreciate it, and I'm totally with it for billions of years (assuming the world is real from here on lol) until it gets to the beginning. I'm not saying that the theory of the big bang is stupid, or that the possibility of multiple universes isn't real. But it always bugs me that I can't go back to the very beginning for sure in my head. That even if either of those answers is the one, how is that possible? Eventually, we are supposed to accept that there was at one point ""nothing"" and I feel like that is a nearly impossible concept to wrap your head around. How could there ever have been a single point in nothing? And where did the single point come from? And what was the nothing? Where is the nothing? What is nothing? I think that's called infinite regress? Not sure. Fix it for me.

How do I get over these things? Can you help me understand? I feel like not understanding these (possibly basic?) concepts has kept me from accepting that there is no god. 

In my head, all come from and all return to. Something eternal and universal. That's it. I don't see this as a negative thing. I even think of the universe as ""God"" sometimes as it is infinite, we all come from it, are connected by it, and return to it in some other form of energy. And if we are a part of this universe, if we are a part of ""god,"" eventually, we can manipulate it too &amp; become even more connected to each other and to it in our understanding. 

Unless

Am I already an atheist? Do we take issue with my definition of God? Is the universe my god? I find a lot of comfort in my previous definition concerning connection and infinity. Am I just scared to let go of the term?

1338985596.0,unu65,I'm a bit out of my league here. Could I get some help?,King_Fluffi,33,4,39,"I have been having a conversation with a friend of mine (much older than me) about morality. In my previous email I made three objections to morality in the bible, could you help me tackle these refutations? I apologize for the long read. 

Objection #1: “So it seems like objective right and wrong exists, right and wrong is independent of God. If you say it stems from his nature, then morality exists without God, and he is simply recognizing this and passing it along to us.”

I think that you’ve committed some errors in logic. First, Jesus said, “No one IS good except God alone” (Mark 10:18, Luke 18:19). When we participate in goodness we are acting in communion with God. Peter refers to that as “participating in the divine nature” (2 Peter 1:3-7). Thus, human goodness is found in our ability to reflect the divine image. The good in humanity come from God in that it reflects God’s image. James, for example, says, coming down from the Father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change”(Jas 1:17). When I recognize my own reflection in a mirror

Second, then morality exists without God, and he is simply recognizing this and passing it along to us.” In fact the metaphor you used “stems from” contradicts your own statement. If something “stems from” something it remains vitally connected to it. For example, leaves on tree “stem from” the branches that in turn stem from the trunk that in turn stem from the roots. So, are the leaves somehow now independent of the tree? That’s absurd. The leaves are in fact vitally connected to the tree. They participate in the nature or the “tree-ness” of the tree as long as they remain connected to the tree. If they are cut off from that vital connection they die and soon cease to exist as parts of a tree. They loose all of their “tree-ness” and become soil. Again, this is similar to verse mentioned above about humans “participating in the divine nature.” Paul is quoted as saying, “In him we live and move and have our being” (Acts 17:28). Thus, this is how being a follower Jesus is most often described in the New Testament; we are “in Christ.” Thus

Objection #2 “There are also several instances in the bible where God acts murderously or commands, which you claim gives us the reason that murder is wrong. Yet how do you explain Leviticus 20:9, which states that children shall be put to death for cursing their parents? Or even more abhorrent is Isaiah 13:15, which mandates that ""Their little children will be dashed to death right before their eyes"", and ""Their homes will be sacked and their wives raped by the attacking hordes. For I will stir up the Medes against Babylon, and no amount of silver or gold will buy them off. The attacking armies will shoot down the young people with arrows. They will have no mercy on helpless babies and will show no compassion for the children."" This is appalling, and has absolutely no moral justification. Any God who would set such laws is surely not a just and good god.

I really think a course in basic logic would do you well, friends and professors it would do you well to have some good tools for evaluating what people think. 

First, this is called self-contradiction. It’s similar to the nonsensical statement of the relativist, “There is no absolute truth.” It is nonsensical because it makes an absolute truth claim that there is no absolute truth. Another example is one that extreme skeptics often make, “We can’t know anything.” If we can’t know anything, then how could we know that we can’t know anything? 

Second, said, “good poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful emotions” (Preface to Lyrical Ballads). So, the simple answer to Isaiah 13 simply, “It’s poetry dude! Don’t take it literally.” This actually clears up a number of the supposedly “problematic” passages in the Old Testament though it doesn’t explain off all of the violent commands of the Old Testament. But, I think I get your point. 

You could have given me a better example such as God’s commands to Israel (through Joshua) to conquer Canaan. “When the Lord your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess and drives out before you many nations –the Hittites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites, seven nations larger and stronger than you– and when the Lord your God has delivered them over to you and you have defeated them, then you must destroy them totally. Make no treaty with them, and show them no mercy” (Deut. 7). Now

(1)	What is right or wrong for God isn’t necessarily the same as what is right or wrong for humans. For example (within a theist framework), we can see that in many cases we do this as humans. Let’s say that I own a really nice Harley Davidson motorcycle and you want to use it. It would be wrong for you walk into my house, take my keys and ride off on my bike without any permission. Now let’s say that I want to use my bike. Would it be wrong for me to walk into my house, take my keys and ride off on my bike without any permission? Of course not. But, why? Because I own the bike. I am under no obligation to ask anyone’s permission to use what rightfully belongs to me. 
(2)	Now, that doesn’t mean that it is wrong for God to take a human life. This is what Job realize after the loss of his entire family, “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD” (Job 1:21). If God really does exist and makes the decision to give life, then it logically follows that He alone can rightfully decide when to take life back again. We often accuse doctors of “playing God” when they act in questionable ways to terminate the life of a patient. You may not like the idea that God alone has the right to determine when to take a human life, but it doesn’t make the idea irrational or arbitrary. 
(3)	When God issues a command plague or death it is always connected to the just punishment of evil, “this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease, but did not aid the poor and needy” (Eze 16:49). Yikes!!! Sounds like America: proud, fat, rich and doesn’t give a shit about the poor. When a culture cares more about getting a cheaper iPad and doesn’t care about the dangerous working conditions poor factory worker in China assembling those iPads it’s is testing God’s patience. 
(4)	Borrowing from C.S. Lewis’ description of Aslan can thus say that God is good, you’re going to be grabbing a lion by its tale. This idea should be consoling though. The Old Testament God (which is that same God of the New Testament by the way) will punish injustice. This gives hope to everyone suffering under oppressive governments and dictators. God is keeping score on injustice and will one day dish out justice (that what all that imagery in Revelation is all about). 
(5)	So, we need to understand that a “nation” in the ancient world was not the same as a nation in the modern world. We aren’t talking about millions or even billions of people like when we talk about the Chinese or Indians. Ancient nations were numbered in the thousands and some were not much bigger than what we would call a tribe today. So, it’s not like we are saying that 3.8 billion people were so evil that they deserved to die. There weren’t even 3.8 billion people on the planet in the ancient world. But, it is possible for ancient-world-size groups of people to become utterly vicious and evil. Today we call them Al-Qaeda. If you study ancient near eastern history, as I have, you will soon realize that these groups of people that God was talking about were the ancient world equivalents of Al-Qaeda, but much worse. Common practices in these nations included: bestiality, regular child sacrifice (not the once a year stuff of the Incas)
(6)	What if God killed a minority of innocent people as he carried out his wrath on the majority who deserved it? Well, “God is slow to anger.” Even the plagues begin small and become worse and worse. The Egyptian could also be spared if they repented and did what the Hebrews did during the Passover meal and many were spared. In fact, we read that when the Hebrews finally left Egypt, “a mixed multitude also went up with them” (Ex. 12:38). So, there were Egyptians who did repent were spared by God. The same was true of Rahab the prostitute. God spared her too. Prior to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, we find Abraham haggling with God to spare the cities. Abraham posed this very question to God, “Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?”(Ge 18:23) He asked if God would spare the city on behalf of 50 righteous people. God responded that He would in fact spare the city if there were 50 righteous people in it. Abraham bargained God all the way down to 10 people and God finally said, there weren’t even 10 innocent people in the two cities. But
(7)	Thus
(8)	For the sake of argument let’s just say that annihilation of these people was somehow justified. Still, I’ll state the obvious. Such a person would have to be damn sure it’s God talking. Let’s take Joshua since he was given the largest such command in the Old Testament (the conquest of Canaan). Who was Joshua? He began his life as a Hebrew slave in Egypt. He was an eyewitness to the miraculous plagues against Egypt during the Exodus. Moses who spoke face to face with God groomed him. He physically followed God, who appeared as a pillar of cloud by day and fire by night. He was the only other person allowed into the tent of meeting with Moses as Moses met with God. So, I think of anyone in the Old Testament, Joshua would qualify as someone who is damn sure when God is talking. 

Objection #3 Finally, was the exact moment that we became like God? Was it when we were still single celled organisms, or perhaps when we developed limbs? Was it when we shifted from being quadrupedal to bipedal? Or was it when we evolved from our most recent evolutionary ancestor? It doesn't make sense that, if we were truly created in God's image, we would have evolved at all.

So it is my contention that eating meat is a position you could not possibly arrive at with a developed sense of morality *unless* you had some extremely credible moral authority tell you that it was ok to do it. Since atheists do not have a credible moral authority

Moving quickly through the first part of the argument, and Jesus even encourages his followers to eat meat with him. If you believe your holy book is literally the words and beliefs of your God, then I can see how you would arrive at a belief that eating meat was fine.

However

1. Argument from food security

A vegetarian diet is about ten times more energy efficient than the same number of calories taken as meat. That is to say, those people could be in a position where they are no longer starving

If you prefer a more concrete example, I have saved about $900 over a meat-eater. If everyone in the US did this, then donated that money to charity it would come out at about $300 billion

Peter Singer proposed the 'Singer Principle' - if you can sacrifice something of moral importance X to ensure a good moral outcome Y, so it might be ok for them to eat meat. But since atheists know that there is no heaven, we are condemning those starving to a pretty nasty death for the sake of enjoying our meals slightly more

2. Argument from animal rights

It is pretty well accepted that animals are capable of feeling things like pain and slightly less well accepted, feeling intentional states and feeling emotions like 'fear' and 'surprise' (even if they feel those emotions to a lesser degree and with a lesser degree of rationality to humans). It is pretty well accepted among atheists that the humans came to be through a process of iterative evolution that does not make us significantly morally different to most animals. The religious deny this, of course, but that's why we mock them

Raising an animal for the sole purpose of killing it seems wrong if we accept there are reasons we don't kill humans for food (even those humans not capable of reasoning such as infants or the infirm elderly). I know all atheists love to eat babies

*Some atheists on r/atheism told me they* would *eat a human if it wasn't stigmatized against - perhaps this argument wouldn't convince them as much as it convinces me*

So with that in mind

1325615079.0,o1cfl,Atheism is the most prudent choice: A twist on Pascal's Wager,shiftysquid,40,12,62,"OK

But as I've debated with Christians (a former one, I've often been sideswiped with Pascal's Wager, a long-debunked argument with which I'm sure most of you are familiar. If you don't know what Pascal's Wager states, here's the gist of it, and the page from [the Wikiz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager): If God exists, and you choose to believe, you gain eternal life in heaven; if God exists and you choose to disbelieve, you lose/gain nothing; if God doesn't exist and you choose not to believe

In thinking about this recently, even if we grant the premises that one can honestly choose what they believe and that there is, in fact, a God, atheism is actually the most prudent choice in this situation (not that I think I'm the first one to think of this, to be clear).

To explain, or be an atheist."" It's ""Believe in my god, or that god, or that god, or that god, etc., etc.,"" more or less. Thus, if they even have one. 

What we can say is that it's entirely plausible that the god(s) who does exist would be more irritated at you worshiping a different god than it would if you don't worship any god at all. After all, it's not unreasonable to suggest that any god who would create us with the ability for reason and complex thinking would want to reward us for using our brain to the extent we could, not simply choosing a god to believe in in order to hedge our bets.

Thus, the correct ones may punish you forever. If you choose the right god, you gain eternal life. If you choose no god, the correct god may punish you forever, or may reward you for using the mind it gave you to think for yourself and not simply pick a god to believe in.

1319939167.0,ltqb0,Do you view my position on religion as unreasonable?,PoliSciProf,35,5,174,"(Long time lurker

I have been seeing a lot of pro-atheism posts making their way to the front page of Reddit and have been impressed by the size of the atheist community.  Some (but by no means all) of these posts seem anti-religion.  I am wondering whether my religious views seem unreasonable.

I am a Catholic by faith although I might be called a cafeteria Catholic since there are parts of my faith that I have a hard time believing.  I (perhaps incorrectly) chalk this up to a skepticism that the Catholic Church (which insists that God is mysterious and at the same time insists that they can interpret what is mysterious) is a bit suspect as a claim.  Either he is knowable (in which case there would be NO debate) or he is mysterious (in which case we are just making the best possible guess that we can under the circumstances).

I am personally offended when others use God to justify war, prejudice, and the like.  While I personally believe abortion is morally wrong, I do not favor a law banning it.  Since it is a moral issue, I have no problem with individuals who choose to do so (and I am not one of those who do this) spending time attempting to convince others of the correctness of their position.  However, when they try to intimidate others, that is going far over a civil line.  On to my beliefs (I am sure I am leaving something out but this is what I have at this moment):

I believe the following:

1. God exists.

2. We cannot fully comprehend God.

3. God is merciful.

4. The bible is a religious book.

5. The Koran is also a religious book.

6. There are many other religious books and all hold truth for those who believe.  Those who forget that we can't hope to comprehend something that exists for us because of faith and insist that it is all literally true or hold one passage to justify an action that clearly goes against the grain of what the religion claims to be the truth are not really thinking this out.

7. There are many paths to God.  Claims that your path is correct and some other path is wrong is not only disrespectful but contains the seeds of hubris that frighten many sane individuals.  Saying we must rely on faith and then saying your faith is ""correct"" and my faith is ""wrong"" is not only intolerant but misguided (at best).

8. Heaven is different for each person and is reserved for those who practice their faith.  Catholics who practice their faith get heaven (and purgatory for those that feel they deserve it since they believe in it)

9. Hell, Hitler is not burning in an eternal fire.  He simply ceased to exist.  (I would however like to imagine that God may let the truly evil a split second understanding of what they are missing but that is borne more out of my sense of fairness and less from what I understand a loving God to be like.)

10. Those who choose not to believe will NOT be punished by a vengeful God.  Instead

11. If you choose to believe in God and choose a path to him/her/it, you are free to choose another but you can't have it both ways.  Now if you sincerely in your heart believe that a particular teaching is wacky but the religion is correct overall, you are not being punished for that.  However, ignoring tenets of faith because they are inconvenient is not ok.

11A. This means that saying you are a Christian

11B. An example of this would be a Catholic going nuts when they hear that abortion is not illegal, immigration (pro-immigration), and the like.

12. All religious books (including the bible) are at best, Genesis suggests that God played some role in the creation of the world, but to think it happened exactly as portrayed (especially since there are two creation stories in Genesis that contradict each other) is at best, naive.

13. It is entirely possible to be a nice person without invoking God.  God is not a necessary precondition for a functioning society.  For me though

The problem of evil is a good example of this.  I think it has potential problems that I think need to be addressed before we can consider it a useful and powerful argument against particular god concepts.

Let me start by saying that I **do** think it has merit against the classic Christian God.  But, demonstrate that such a being probably doesn't exist.  More on that later.

First

P1) An all-loving god would prevent evil.  
P2) An all-powerful god could prevent evil.  
P3) But
C)  Therefore

Premise 1 and 2 are the real items at issue.  There are many responses to both of these.  Would god prevent evil?  Could he prevent evil?  Let's deal with the ""would he"" first.

You have all heard the theistic rebuttals to this.  Freewill!  God has a master plan!  He works in mysterious ways!  All of these are an attempt to ""explain"" why god would not want to prevent evil

&gt;If the god in question is truly all-powerful, etc.), and still not require that evil exist.  If he can do absolutely anything then he should be able to do this.

&gt;It makes no sense to say he doesn't want to prevent evil because these other things will be compromised if he has the power to stop evil and also not allow these things to be compromised.  If he has such power

At that point

The definition of omnipotence my counter argument above somewhat relies on is ""all-power with absolutely no limitations.""  However

You might ask ""Why should we accept this definition?""  But, we **must** accept this caveat.  After all, if you are using a logical argument (i.e. the problem of evil) to counter their god claim, it would be pointless to use it against a god concept that is not limited by the rules of logic.  If he can do anything, including things that aren't logically possible, then the problem of evil is rendered useless against such a concept.

So

If we claim, master plan, etc.) and still not require evil to exist, then this puts the burden of proof on us to demonstrate that such a thing is logically possible.  And, I have no real way of demonstrating that.

Bear in mind, it is a weakness in the problem of evil argument.

As I said before, according to their theology, freewill can exist while evil doesn't.  And, that god, being omniscient would know how his master plan would turn out anyway.  So, he could simply skip all of that and only create the people who would choose to worship him (had they been subjected to his rat maze experiment) in Heaven, free of suffering.

It's just that when it comes to other god concepts which don't carry this theological baggage with them, please point it out.  As I said in the beginning, I want to make sure that my arguments pass muster.

I don't want to argue don't about a literal interpretation of the Bible. The phrase ""It's a Metaphor"" can be applied to many of the stories inside of it, in accepting the command given by Jesus Christ to love each other the way Jesus loves us. If we act that way and accept salvation when it is presented to us, I believe we all will go to heaven.

What so many atheists form their anti-religious beliefs on is problems within the church - pedo bishops, etc. Problems such as these have been around since the earliest days of the church (see the bulk of the New Testament, when Paul writes the churches and points out a number of their issues, often involving church leaders who are telling a different version of the Gospel). What people forget is that Christians aren't supposed to develop their beliefs and practices from the church. They are told to believe and follow Christ.

Everything about his life made the incoherent old Jewish prophecies make sense. The improbable circumstances surrounding his birth reveal why Jesus deserves our attention. What did Jesus have that we don't? The right environment; the right circumstances. He also had an unwavering devotion to a life of virtue. Can anyone actually criticize his life or actions?

He saw his purpose and lived accordingly - to serve as a role model for every human on Earth. He only commanded us to do one thing, but just to love each other with a perfect love. He also told us that no matter how many mistakes, as long as we seek salvation through him then irrational fear doesn't need to exist. The key isn't to do enough good deeds to get to heaven. It's to give it your best shot and not give up when you fail.

So, but that the existence of creation necessitates a Creator. I believe that our recognition of beauty in such arbitrary things as a sunset or waves on a beach is evidence of our relation to that Creator, and despite our best efforts, that Creator will always be in control - the chemicals of emotion and circuitry of intelligence that comprise our bodies can only give fleeting glimpses of whatever force created every star in the sky. I believe that the Creator is continually being revealed, but that revelation requires an act of will on our part, a recognition of something larger than ourselves. The rational response to this recognition is an alteration of our behavior and our attitude. To me that's enlightenment, which is synonymous with salvation.

I've studied various philosophies to keep myself honest while I gained a higher education, the rational mind sees that the social structures surrounding the rule have changed. Therefore rigid adherence to something that stands in opposition to the one command we have been given can't be right. Jesus was not on the side of organized religion - that's what nobody seems to get these days.

Supporting equal rights is different than supporting traditional heterosexual marriage.. Heterosexual marriage is already established and not going anywhere. Whereas same sex marriage is exceedingly rare in the US

I am more than happy to tolerate other's views so long as they don't seek to impose their belief structure on others through government or law. As such if a person disagrees with gay marriage but also wouldn't vote to limit a persons ability to do it I am fine with this. If you don't agree with gay marriage don't get one

I think if the CEO left his degree of involvement in this issue to a simple statement the reaction from the public would be different. However they chose invest millions of dollars into groups seeking to limit the rights of others.

I haven't heard a single cogent argument against equal marriage rights. Christian dogma is not sufficient reason to limit this right on a national level. 

I apologize if I come off as rude

1. Marriage by definition is one man and one woman. It has never been 2 people of the same sex. so you have to redefine marriage in order to legalize it. 

2. No-one is not allowed to marry. You simply adhere to what a marriage is. 

3. If 2 men or women marry then we should also allow polygamy and people can marry animals as well. You have to have limits of some kind. Per the naturalistic worldview we are just animals anyway so any animal can marry any animal right?

4. All social studies have demonstrated that the ideal environment for children is with a married Mom and dad. The latest study shows all of the problems of children raised by gay couples done by a prof at the u of Texas. The press didn't like his results even though it was the largest sample ever studied. There is a current investigation into his study...only because of hIs results...so much for science. Just because heterosexuals aren't doing things right doesn't make gay marriage a good idea either.

5. Common sense. It is amazing to me that few acknowledge the physics problem. Homosexuality does not work. The body was not designed for that. This is where the debate should end.
6. Society encourages behaviors like marriage for its good. It discourages non ideal behaviors. If gay couples are worried about estates and financial medical issues there are already legal options for them.

7. Even the naturalist should oppose homosexual behavior since it does not have any survival benefit and in fact has the opposite effect. This would impede evolution. 
8. There are over 20 diseases caused by male homosexual acts. Why should we encourage this? An act that can damage someone should be warned about. To not warn is not loving. 

9. To disagree with a behavior is not anti-gay. If it is harmful

I am going to license my car today so I show up at the dmv with a horse. They tell me sorry this isn't a car and so won't let me legally drive it on the street or license it. I keep saying that the horse is a car but we all know it is a horse. Marriage has already been defined and it is already legal for all. No liberties are lost. Sorry may be a poor analogy but hope you get my point.

And I didn't even mention the bible.


Also...for those who are naturalists

If we are evolved animals then we have no free will just as Sam Harris rightly points out in his new book Free Will. He says free will is an illusion....of course he contradicts himself numerous times after that. He says we really can't not help but believe what we do. So we have no choice. So how can anyone say what anyone says is wrong? Carl kathey or anyone for that matter is determined to believe what they do. This is consistent with materialism. All is matter and nothing more. Only a theistic world view allows us to debate these issues. So of course christians are going to use the bible as an objective standard of morality.

To summarize

&gt; Somethings are not provable but require faith.

He then expresses concern on the fact that atheists reject faith and treat it with a certain degree of abhorrence. Instead, they conveniently ignore the fact that as human beings, they operate and interact with others using a faith-based system of attachment, trust and respect (e.g. love, justice, equality of men). They do not realize that to some people, the concept of god is as fundamental and is based on the same faith as the system of attachment

However

EDIT: Redskyvar replied
I'm happy that this post generated so much response, is not arguing for religious faith, but rather in ""I have faith in **the existence** of god"". Note that religious faith encompasses faith in the existence of god, but both faiths are not the same. To quote hotpackage:
&gt;A belief is just an assumption that you've taken for granted. Faith is a baseless/unjustified assumption that you've taken for granted.

Many theists mistake their holy scriptures as evidence, and may merely believe that a god of some sort exists. I think Redskyvar is trying to argue in that direction.

EDIT2: And to point out something in case people get sidetracked - Redskyvar is **not arguing for the existence of god of any sort**.

Me:  I am unable to speak on this.  I don't know much about biblical prophecies but I would guess that this is wrong.  Since there is so much interpretation in the bible it is hard to distinguish parable and hyperbole from actual 'prophecy.'  If you want we can talk about this later.

I did my research on /r/debateanatheist and /r/atheism and came back with the facts and the prophecies which did not come true.  We discussed the issue with self fulfilling prophecies (the state of Isreal) and logic fallacies (sharp shooter fallacy among others).  Then we moved onto prophecies which did not come true. I started at the beginning with how God tells Adam he will die the day he eats a fruit from the tree of knowledge.  When Adam ate the fruit he did not die.  He lived for another 930 years.  

His and another theist's response were ""it could be metaphorically dead"" 

I shut down.  I told them that I would not have a discussion where confirmation bias was used to fit one argument. I redirected it to the quote and how it clearly states he will die. 

They both went back to metaphor again... so I gave them the sites I had read and stopped the conversation.  I don't believe that either read it (other than a comment about baby soup... mmm baby soup.).

Is there a better way to handle this when a theist changes what their interpretation or says it isn't meant to be taken literal?  I get very frustrated when they do this but I am in TX so they are sensitive to the subject of religion (aka I am wrong no matter how much proof I present)

Even though I'm a Christian, and especially Camus.

So imagine my surprise when a friend of mine on Facebook posted a link to Richard Dawkins' God Delusion videos.

Now, was the way that for a video attempting to encourage free-thinking rationalism, it sure seemed to rely quite heavily on emotional appeal. This, by the way, is not something in Dawkins' approach that seems to be limited to these videos. It's also a trait I've seen, albeit to a far lesser extent, in Hitchens and Harris.

My concern is this: Wittingly or not, so to speak, seems ultimately counterproductive to their ostensible goal of free thought. Rather than a society in which men and women hold to views based on their own merit, they seem to be simply providing an alternative shepherd for the sheep to follow. Even many atheists that I've spoken to have condemned the New Atheists for being ""populists.""

Now, the authors are anonymous, time, individual interpretation, and a number of other things change it regularly.  Even if god does exist, the bible would certainly not be a reliable source on the subject (though arguably, the only we have)

On the other hand, that I have seen.  Heck, half the arguments I see boil down to ""if there is a god, he doesn't seem as great as you claim.""  Something else I see a lot is people treating evolution as if it debunks the notion of a god entirely, and from what I have seen that is just not true.

Basically, and neither of those sit right with me.  Is there actual science that suggests the belief in a god is wrong, or is it just the bible we can go against?  It seems to me that god is at the very least still a very distinct possibility, but it doesn't seem right to put true faith and conviction behind any holy book.

1368059201.0,1dyvzg,"Some useful basics on truth, belief, and knowledge",simism66,31,49, and knowledge.  Pressupositionalists rely on this sort of tactic, but when we try to *make explicit* what we mean by these things

First, ""the cat is on the mat"" is true iff the cat is on the mat.  

“Objective truth” is somewhat of a redundancy, since, though we are embedded in different cultures and traditions, we all inhabit the same world.

We can think of a given belief as a sort of commitment to the truth of a particular sentence.  A belief is a sort of *taking-true.*  So

A given belief is knowledge if it is *warranted* (I use ""warranted"" rather than the traditional ""justified"" because ""justified"" ends up getting confusing and over-intellectualizes the issue) and *actually true*.  Since we are *largely rational* beings that *understand the world in certain ways* (evidenced by the fact that we can have *reasonable discussion* with others about the *world we share) most of our beliefs must, we'd be like fish out of water, constantly bumping into things, unable to make sense of the world at all!  And, warranted by this explanation (once again, however the details end up being cashed out), most of our beliefs must be knowledge.

Most people working in contemporary epistemology endorse a *fallibilist* conception of knowledge.  Fallibilism is the thesis that we don't need to absolutely certain of something in order for it to count as knowledge.  Since I'm not *absolutely certain* of *any empirical fact, and that's patently absurd.  I know  lots of things, and everyday understanding and competence attests to this.

Is it possible that most of our beliefs are false?  I don't think so.  Someone might bring up the possibility of a sort of Matrix scenario.  Is this an actual possibility?  I'm not sure.  Either way, it just so happens that the objects we're talking about and interacting with are *virtual* rather than *physical* but they're still just as real.  David Chalmers has [argued this point](http://consc.net/papers/matrix.html) saying that the Matrix hypothesis is a *metaphysical* rather than *epistemological* argument.

So yes.  We have a lot of true beliefs,"" or ""We'll never *really* know what's true"" is just plain silly.  Skepticism of this sort should have ended with Hume.

My first and only love is a creationist and is very well versed and involved in her religion.

Her contradiction to fossils are that we cannot date them using carbon dating (as she tells me carbon dating doesn't work for things past a certain age). Also, even if this DID happen, the fact that substrate (rocks, sand, and mud) would tear these skeletonsa to pieces (sandpaper, force, the fact that fleshy bodies are very delicate compared to rocks, so much so that we can determine some dinosaur behaviors (protecting nests

This girl is VERY smart and aware. As an agnostic I really don't mind her Christianity (to each his/her own because the universe is one big mystery and there is always the unknown at the back of every story, the end product of our value systems and how we wish to live our lives comes out the same.

I have recently been delving into the subject of the historicity of Jesus, Arif Ahmed and many others. However, I am genuinely finding that the evidence against Jesus' resurrection appears to be minimal. 

Of course, and that natural solutions should be considered before differing to the miraculous. 

But, but ""group hallucinations"" of near 500 people would be just as miraculous as a resurrection account. 

When it comes to secular sources, when I consult more objective historical sources, it appears that this is not the case. Josephus, for one, is famously noted for being fallacious due to early church forgery. However, there is reason to believe that the core of his message is legitimate, as well as his later reference to Jesus. Also the works of Tacitus and Plymmy appear to be more reliable than I would have thought. 

Anyways, but I want to learn more. I hope that I did not come across as aggressive or harsh in any way, shape or form. I am just a guy looking to find the truth. Whatever that may be.

Thanks for the help.

If one were to prove something, I have to assume that what my senses tell me actually do reflect reality and that I'm not in a dream world or in the matrix.

Descartes contends that the ultimate assumption or presumption that we need to rely on to prove any knowledge at all is God.

Nihilism says that since we do not know what the absolute truth is (there *could* be a God, there is no way to prove that anything exists.  You can't prove that we're *not* in the matrix, right?  Therefore, you can't prove that this chair I'm sitting on exists, or that I exist, for that matter.

This is subsequently tied into the issue of right and wrong (not morality!).  It's possible that morality is evolutionary advantageous and therefore is a genetic trait that is selected for.  That's not what I'm arguing.

~Note: I'm equating morality in this sense with a conscience.

I'm arguing that as an atheist, but you can't even begin to prove that it's *wrong*.

I'd like to keep this debate philosophical and leave science out of it.  I'd be willing to debate science vs religion some other time (I would argue that the two are not mutually exclusive).

Update:

My main challenge to atheists is this: How do you justify objective laws?  How can you tell one person, career criminal, etc.).  Who are you to say what they do is ""wrong""?  You can go kill him as retribution.  Without absolute ""right"" and ""wrong"", wouldn't society become pure anarchy as each individual lives by his own personal morality?  Why is this not this way?  How can you sustain objective ""rightness"" and ""wrongness"" and not only create laws but *abide* by laws that rely on this objective right vs wrong.

Doesn't abiding by and living by objective ""rights"" and ""wrongs"" go against true atheism?

We can move away from murder as an example because it's easy to argue that even if you *want* to murder, slavery (domination by force i.e. North Korea), etc.

- My only argument was against the *source* of atheists' morality

- Just to clarify what went on here:

   - I said atheists have no source of objective morality.
   - Atheists say that objective morality is not necessary at all for them to justify what they do and don't do.
   - Some atheists said that a supernatural and transcendent source is not sufficient to say that whatever morality that comes from it is objective.  I won't necessarily argue against that

But first

I heard the tale of how a young woman became a Christian. She had grown up atheist, things in her life start tumbling downhill very quickly, and eventually she's reached a point where all she wants to do is end her life. Her grandmother, who is also an atheist, starts insisting that she go to church, because she needs help. She's taken aback by this, because her grandmother is also an atheist and hates church, in her grandmother's town, says something along the lines of ""I don't know why I'm saying this, but kind of writes it off as coincidence. As soon as the service is over

So here's the reason why I told that story: As an argument for the existence of God, but embellishing a few things here and there. She could think she's telling the truth, but have a few details fudged by her perceptions at the time. Even if the story is 100% true, it's still not entirely convincing. It could be coincidence. It could be that her body language betrayed her hopelessness, prompting the actions of the pastor and Christian who prayed with her. Even if there were some sort of fate, or higher power, or something involved in there

But here's the deal: As far as she's concerned, saving her life by guiding her towards Him and informing others of her plight. To her, she's experienced God in a real, undeniable, life-changing way, and so the odds of empirical evidence or rational arguments causing her to abandon that belief are astronomical.

I argued, religious experience (or lack thereof) is the single largest factor in our decision as to what we believe (or don't) - and the consensus seemed to be in agreeance, as much as one can draw a consensus from anything on Reddit.

I'm sure that members of this subreddit are no strangers to this habit amongst theists: ""I don't know why I believe in God, as well. I personally have yet to meet an atheist IRL who's said that their reason for atheism depends primarily on evidence. It's typically something along the lines of ""I don't like the idea of something being in control other than me"" or ""My life's been awful, and I've prayed to God that He might do something, and nothing's happened, "" or even ""I've had terrible experiences with the church and Christians.""

In fact, someone really close to me had no one intervene and they actually committed suicide, so where was your God then?"" And I think that sentiments like these are ultimately what end up driving our beliefs - at least, most of us. Our arguments often become a sort of veneer to justify what we already feel to be true - again, amongst theists and atheists alike.

And really, I do think that to suggest that someone who is both rational and emotional base their decisions purely off the rational side is to attempt to deny who and what we are. Our emotions will always play some role in what we believe, what we argue, and how we react - why attempt to deny that?

So here's the big point: Religious arguments turn into such a mess because no one is actually addressing anyone else's issues. We're taking something that's intensely personal and trying to turn it into some abstract, as there are quite a few people who change their beliefs because of them. Even in those cases, though, I would argue that it is, largely, experience at work - they might say ""I was an atheist, but I just had this feeling that there had to be more to life than this, but I just had so many questions and so much doubt

Now, until one book or one argument or one video made them change their minds completely, but they're rare.

So, but that if theists and atheists really want to be able to dialogue with one another, that's going to require talking about what experiences pushed us to assume whatever position we do. In practice, this is horrifically difficult, since it would require that we all be willing to bear our deepest secrets to a bunch of total strangers so that they can try and tear them apart. It would also run the risk of turning debates into a practice of simply comparing scars.

But I honestly believe that this is what's at the crux of the debate - that this is why theists and atheists have such a hard time seeing eye to eye, when their arguments have been refuted, often don't suffer any lack of confidence in their beliefs (or, again, lack thereof).

To start, so don't expect answers immediately. She is a very active individual**

Also

These are some huge questions, they have been written already by people far more intelligent than I). Nevertheless, I will start off by making a few observations.

First - all of these questions seem to get at one main point that I often hear my atheist friends asserting: that Christianity is illogical. I don't dispute this claim. In many ways

Second - Most Christians don't spend time trying to answer these questions for themselves. Many are afraid of where the hard questions will lead them. Others are so ingrained in the systems in which they were raised and indoctrinated that it doesn't even occur to them that there are worldviews and intelligent belief systems outside of them. I confess I have been guilty of both of these things at various points in my life

Third - Sometimes, there are many difficult questions I am still working through and have not solved. I admire my atheist friends - many of them seem to have worked through the problematic questions more faithfully than I have at times.

Fourth - The fundamental divide that I see between Christians and Atheists (and the reason why there's a lot of back and forth mud-slinging) is because their fundamental means of determining what is truth (or, relying heavily on scientific and empirical methods to determine what is truth and what is not (thus, the frustration with the Bible and other assertions Christians make which are not 'provable' with scientific means). Christians however often have a different epistemological system, one in which truth is garnered through a variety of means. For example, Wesleyan (or Methodist) Christians often rely on four main ways of discerning what is 'true': reason (yes, it's in there - and all the atheists rejoiced!), tradition, and Scripture. So

All of this leads me to the main point. The sense I am getting from these questions is that you are asserting two things: 1) Christianity has flaws

This is where I think the problem lies. Because a system or a relationship has flaws or discrepancies does not rule it out altogether. All systems and all relationships have flaws. This does not negate the overall integrity of said system or relationship. For instance, in such a way that it was actually my own error, rather than the error of my friend, which caused the relaying of wrong information? Or perhaps our situation has changed and now the information is no longer valid. For instance, perhaps in the beginning of our relationship, he/she said to me ""You are the most important person in the world to me"" and later he/she married. Suddenly, the words from previous need to be reinterpreted in light of the changing situation

All of this is just a roundabout way of saying that I think there are some bigger themes at work here than just answering those particular questions. I am glad to engage them and will certainly share with you some of my thoughts. I'll also freely admit when I just don't know the answers because I am in a journey along with the rest of humanity

What keeps me a Christian is the truth I've discovered so far, but it might just be more Christian mumbo jumbo that doesn't relate to the way you build meaning in the first place. And I can respect that. :)

Lastly - an apology. For all the Christians everywhere who have failed to take your good questions seriously, I'm sorry.
Sometimes we Christians do a piss poor job of living as Christ did. I'm thankful and grateful that you'd invite me into this conversation and look forward to giving you better answers when it's not 11 PM and I can think and see straight again. :)

Possibly a long read.,waltmaniac,25,4,39,"As you all probably know this is one of creationists' favorite times of year to post outlandish claims on the internet.  One of my friends posted something about the resurrection and I responded facetiously (text below).  But

**My friend's OP:**  From (name omitted):

HAPPY RESURRECTION DAY FOLKS!

Here is one of my favorite conspiracies mentioned in the Bible. It is found in Matthew 28:11-15

11 Now while they were on their way, 13 and said, “You are to say, ‘His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.’ 14 And if this should come to the governor’s ears, we will win him over and keep you out of trouble.” 15 And they took the money and did as they had been instructed; and this story was widely spread among the Jews, and is to this day.

Some of the guards? How many guards were there? (anywhere from a squad or two to a full platoon).

What were they guarding? Somebody that was killed.

Why? Because of someone stealing the body? C'mon

The guards reporting to who? Oh

What was the money for? Protection from a fate the the guards would be executed.

Could at be that the guards were asleep? What was the penalty for a guard sleeping on the job and that or whom he/they were guarding gets AWAY. Those guards if found guilty were not going home to their family.

What? Disciples stealing the body? Are you kidding me? Again

This passage is what we call enemy attestation recorded which just one piece of the puzzle making the account of Jesus' resurrection the real deal.

No one stole the body but the resurrection is a miracle prophecies by Jesus

**My Response:**  He supposedly shook up Rome and yet he's suspiciously absent from Roman written record... strange. But

**The accredited's response:**  Alright Justin
CORNELIUS TACITUS (55 - 120 A.D.) Tacitus was a 1st and 2nd century Roman historian who lived through the reigns of over half a dozen Roman emperors. Considered one of the greatest historians of ancient Rome

""Christus, procurator of Judea in the reign of Tiberius. But the pernicious superstition, repressed for a time, broke out again, not only through Judea, where the mischief originated, by through the city of Rome also."" Annals XV

With reference to the resurrection

There are plenty of alternative theories that have been hypothesized by critics to explain the resurrection of Jesus on naturalistic grounds but they all have failed to explain the data and are refuted by the facts.

Even if we were to utilize only the four minimal historical facts that are accepted by virtually all scholars secular and Christian alike

* First

But, so he didn't even live at the same time of the events.  He doesn't cite his sources in it so really he could only have been getting it from the Christian writings correct?  

I'd always believed that the character of Jesus was suspiciously absent from all written record of the time he lived.  Especially considering the amount of supernatural 'goings on' that was supposedly rampant (see:  Matt 27:50-54).  If all these things were happening and Jesus the man was shaking up Rome--why did it take 80+ years to get a reliable secular historian to document?  Also

I see it as avoiding the question. It seems logical to me that either you believe it or you don't. Whether you know it or not is a different matter altogether.

I got into a debate with a friend recently and I tried to explain to him the difference between atheism/theism and agnosticism/gnosticism. I suggested that he was most likely an agnostic atheist.

He disagreed, not an atheist.

He's aware of what the words actually mean - but he proposed that his ""belief"" is absolutely neutral. Until there is evidence either way

So my question to you guys is: **can you really be undecided on whether you believe or not?**

*My position is ""I won't believe the claim until there is evidence"". His position is ""I won't believe OR disbelieve the claim until there is evidence.""*
(so the argument is really about what the ""default position"" is)

To demonstrate such indecision
I had to agree that I couldn't possibly decide on either belief.

2. NOWHERE do I say this must be an all-knowing/all-powerful god or even a god at all

P1. If skeptic

sub-P1. god is not measurable or testable

sub-P2. if belief in only ""x"" which is measurable and testable

sub-C1. if skeptic

Everyone was very to correct to point out that I was ""putting the horse before the carriage"" by saying atheism implied the belief in only the measurable in testable, but on Reddit we tend to link atheism to skepticism so heavily that i made the error of equating atheism and skepticism and created a false premise as a result

P2. If belief in only measurable and testable ""x""

a lot of people complained about this premise, some people had other objections, but I stand by it, here is the reasoning:

sub-P1. If ""x"" is measurable and testable

sub-P2. if ""y"" is known to be physical and can interact with ""x""

sub-P3. instruments that measure and test are known to be physical

sub-C1. if ""x"" is measurable and testable

ok

P3. if belief in only physical

P4. if materialism

a lot of people gave me great insight about how materialism could lead to determinism OR randomness and I agree 100%

C1. if skeptic, modus tollens: if not determinism OR randomness (that is both must be rejected), then not skeptic

so right now, then I must also reject skepticism, which does not invalidate atheism (this is the best part because now I can logically believe in free will without having to be a theist, which is what I was hoping for), but it does remove my root CAUSE to be an atheist, which is to say, without skepticism, or things that are not physical, and that it is a non-physical free will since it cannot be tested or measured

back to the determinism argument:

getting a lot of complaints about the determinism proof

P1. if determinism (or determinism/probability combo)

P2. if effects of all causes (or probability of effects of all causes) are knowable

C1. if determinism

P3. if ""x""is knowable

C2. we must be able to inform the actor of the prediction (C1

P4. the actor being informed of the prediction is a cause

P5. if the actor being informed of the prediction is a cause

P6. assume the actor will be informed of the prediction

P6. If the actor is informed

P7. if the actor will be effected

P8. this new prediction is knowable

P9. if the actor is informed of the new prediction

P10. if the actor will be effected

C3. due to infinite regress, no determinism (modus tollens)

hope this clears things up

as for randomness

Therefore sometime in the future the human race could measure consciousness and as the definition of being scientifically proven

Most if not all religions have the concept of dualism and conclude that consciousness is not only an affect of the brain but also that of the soul or spirit. 

Lets say we've reached this point in time and someone has created an artificial robot which looks and behaviours exactly like a human. This robot contains a computer which replicates everything in the human brain including emotion (fear

My question is, justice system etc.

Optional question assuming you believe it's possible; lets say once your body dies we can transfer your consciousness into the robot. Do you feel as a robot you should be treated equally to other humans beings?

-------------------------------------------

edit: I'm loving the answers but I think most of you who have just answered yes to each just based on how you personally would treat the robot. So it's time to get a little bit deeper!

If consciousness was to be understood scientifically then it would make consciousness rational i.e consciousness is the result of chemical reactions affecting neurons. Once you understand the formulas for the reacting chemicals is when we can create consciousness. Would it still mean that free-will exists?

**Chapter 4 - The Church Is Responsible For So Much Injustice**

So what is he going to try to refute this time?

&gt;*""I have to doubt any religion that has so many fanatics and hypocrites

Let see where Keller takes this. 

&gt;Disillusioned by the combative and exploitative way he thought they used Bible to control people's lives

and?

&gt;If your experience with Christians [is bad] then the arguments for Christianity will have to be extremely strong for you to concede the they have any cogency at all

but

&gt; if you have seen churches that are devout in belief yet civic-minded and generous

Ignoring the loaded language he used to create that dichotomy

&gt;So we have to address the behavior of Christians that has underminded the plausibility of Christianity for many people.

Damn... 

&gt; every act of goodness, and beauty is empowered by God [and] God gives out good gifts of wisdom, talent, beauty, and skill ""graciously"" -- that is, in a completely unmerited way.  He casts them across *all* humanity, regardless of religious conviction...

So if I do a good deed its because God wanted me to?  And Gods desire that I (or any other person) do something good is completely random?  

&gt;Good character is largely attributable to a loving

Wait... I thought you said God is responsible for 'good character' and he allocated it randomly.   What exactly are you trying to argue Keller?  Let me summarize so far.  1) good character comes from a random number generator we call God

So now that Keller has the most convoluted premise set up lets see where he takes it.

&gt;Now imagine that someone with a very broken past becomes a Christian and her character improves significantly over what it was.. [and imagine a really well adjusted women that is not religious]... Suppose you meet both of these the same week.

Wait what?  Why is the Christian improving her character significantly?  Did she win the good gifts lottery from god?  Also why are you assuming I am terrible at statistics?  Anyway lets continue

&gt;It is often the case that people... who are ""lower on the character scale"" are more likely to recognize the nee for God and turn to Christianity.

(Imagine their disapointment when they find out god isn't going to help them anymore than before.)

&gt;We should expect that many Christians' lives would not compare well to those of the nonreligious.

Set the bar as low as possible... I feel like I am listening to political pundits prep the audience for a Presidential debate. 

&gt;Violence done in the name of Christianity  is a terrible reality and must be both addressed and redressed... however

Keller goes on to talk about how sometimes Christians can go off the deepend and express their disdain for groups like 'homosexuals' or 'evolutionists.'   (tangent: does Keller not believe in evolution?  Thats not what he is trying to express here but whenever I hear the word 'evolutionist' a red flag goes up in my mind. )   He rebuts these Christian fanatics with the good old no true scotsman. 

&gt;What if, salvation not because of what we do but because of what Christ has done for us?

He follows this up with a priceless anecdote.

&gt;Because they think of Christianity as a self-improvement program they emulate the Jesus of the whips in the temple

I aggree the bible does send mixed messages.  Keller shift gears with a series of vague self-indulging statements.

&gt;Marx

&gt;As Swiss theologian Karl Barth put it, who crucified Christ.

These lines made me laugh.

&gt;What were the prophets and Jesus criticizing?  They were not against... obedience to Bibilical directions for life. [They were against the obtainment of power via] appeasing [God] through... good works. 

&gt;[God] cannot be manipulated by religious performance -- he can only be reached through repentance... Jesus charged his disciples: Whoever wants to be great among you  be your servant.

&gt;The bible teaches us that our treatment of [the poor] equals are treatment of God.

Keller then moves to his favorite argument that is shared by C.S. Lewis.

&gt; strong secular critics of Christianity are really using resources from within it to denounce it.

&gt;Where

&gt;to give up Christian standards would be to leave us with no basis for criticism. 

Keller then walks us through history with the most insanse selective bias to demonstrate that Christianity improves societies.  Wait what are you arguing?  

&gt;As a historian, courage rather than peaceableness, glory rather than modesty, loyalty to one's own tribe rather than equal respect for all.

Keller then goes on to explain that whenever Christians did bad things it was the left over bad parts of the cultures they took over.  (I thought we weren't arguing that Christianity made you better... whatever)

&gt;When Anglo-Saxons first heard the gospel they were incredulous... When they did convert they were far from consistent. They supported the Crusades.. let monks and women... culitvate charitable virtues that weren't appropriate for men of honor. 

Keller goes on to credit Christians for the end of slavery

&gt; those who campaigned for the end of the slave trade [didn't] stand to gain in any tangible way... Slavery was abolished because it was wrong

the end of communism

&gt;the Catholic church in eastern Europe refused to die under Communism.  Through ""patience

standing strong against Nazis

&gt;the Confessing Church

and the civil rights movement

&gt;When people give their lives to liberate others as Jesus did, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and other Christian voices have called for.  

I am still trying to figure out what Kellers argument was.  This chapter was all over the place.  It almost sounds like a brainstorming exercise on a vague topic.  Instead of working through arguments and figuring out what he wanted to say he just decided to go with his first draft without proof reading beyond clicking spell check.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LIj7HNfKd8&amp;feature=plcp (just 1 part but you can find the others from there). As an intro

He begins by saying that Christianity must be intellectually credible and existentially relevant

1. Quoting Huston Smith, and claimed he was THE God. There have been dozens of people who also claim to be God (e.g. David Koresh) but theyre nut cases and never gained influence like buddha or jesus. There have been many influential people but they don't claim to be God, its cuz their humility/character helped them become so influential. 

2. The claims of Christianity are great. This is the ""data"" that must be dealt with intellectually and explained.
a) Jesus claimed to be God the Messiah and claimed to be bringing the Kingdom of God to earth.
b) hundreds of people saw that Jesus apparently conducted miracles by account of the NT
c) Jesus convinced the people close to him that he was god. The last people on earth who would believe that a real person was God were the 1st century Jews. The 1st century Jews had an understanding of God who was above, the Jews were trained culturally to never worship anything created, as commanded to them by their 10 commandments (1st and 2nd commandment).
d) After Jesus died
e) The experience of that changed the lives of his followers so much that they died to spread the news.

3.
5 options for explanation

1) Contention: Jesus is a legend

Three reasons to refute this contention: 
a) The Bible is not written as legend, and I've written an orderly account so that you may know the certainty of these things."" Luke is saying he's not an eye witness, but he writes like an investigative journalist. The Gospels are not written as legends.. Theyre not good enough as legends. If they are not history, then they are realistic prose fiction that has not existed before 18th century. Example, in the story of Jesus forgiving the prostitute, the author says Jesus sat down and started writing in the dust. That addition has no particular significance in the story, and is a mark that the gospel accounts were meant to be real accounts. Realistic prose fiction is how fiction is written now (e.g. ""She came to the door and turned the knob"") but that style was non-existent before the 18th century. Legends/fiction of the 1st century is not written in that style. From a literary view, or attempted historical accounts. 

b) Gospels written around 70ad

c) Did all the early christians die for a legend/hoax? Quoting: ""Why did Christianity, with no influential backers in high places but consisting mostly of slaves and the poor, why did Christianity succeed and force the most powerful state in world history to come to terms with it? There must have been, at the start of Christianity, a vast release of energy, perhaps unequaled in our history"" It's a possibility that all these early christians died for a lie... but put that together with the idea of when it was written, the Christian faith could never have gotten off the ground. They couldn't have said the tomb was empty unless the tomb really was empty because of the cultural view of resurrection


2) Contention: Jesus was just a good teacher.
Answer: Jesus couldn't be just a good man. He was either who he said he was, you must hate your father and mother."" ""anyone who wants to save his life will lose it, but anyon3e who loses their life for my sake, will find life."" If you want to follow Jesus, you must give him everything. You must love him so much, that love for your family, career

Here Tim Keller seems like he switches a bit to address ""existential relevance:"" 
But look at the quality of JEsus teachings. Its not the raving of a madman. 

He quotes GK Chesterton

""If I found a key on the road, including the best minds in history and the simplest hearts, that it has made itself at home in virtually every culture, inspired masterpieces of beauty in every field of art, continues to grow rapidly and spread and assert itself in lands where a century ago the name of Jesus Christ was not even heard; if such teaching so obviously fits the locks of so many human souls, in so many times and so many places, are they likely to be the work of a deceiver or a fool? In fact it is more likely that they were designed by the Heart Maker…""

If you look at the accounts of Jesus

quote: ""He combined virtues no one had ever seen before: tenderness without weakness, passion without prejudice, holiness and unbending convinctions without a lack of approachability, power without insensitivity, harshest judgement on the self satisfied yet the most winsome kindness to the broken  and the marginal, and never inconsistent about them, never a false stepever a jarring note... ""

The 1st century jews, the very being of God. 

The alternative

Aside:
The historical evidence for Jesus' life is better than the evidence of Caesar's gallic wars. But, no scholar, nobody, because if Christianity is true, we must lose control of our life and change the way we live, for him. Many historical scholars are skeptical of Jesus' account because of this bias.

But IF such a God exists, and were God to be a ""Big Brother"" figure, this would be made very difficult to avoid. To me, if a God exists, it would make far more sense for Him not to have such an active and scientifically confirmed presence. What are your thoughts on this?

Also, would it be preferable (from our viewpoint) that God had created a perfect world where everybody was continuously as happy as could be, and nobody's actions could worsen or improve the condition of themselves, or others, or society? To me this sounds awful, we would effectively be no better than sheep. It makes no sense. Can human suffering then be used as realistic evidence for the atheist viewpoint?

And on my beliefs, considering my knowledge and experience, on the balance of probabilities I believe it is far more likely that there is such a God. Also, I believe that my beliefs improve my life. I understand the atheist viewpoint however, especially considering the nature of the world and universe we all live in.

In case you've never heard about the Ontological Argument
-We have a conception of God as that being which has all perfections. -Existence is a perfection (or, by his definition and our conception of Him.
Discuss!
N.B Kant said famously ""Existence is not a predicate"". If you are familiar with that line of argumentation

**Edit: Some of my comments have been getting downvotes


**Second Edit** This is to address some common responses. I've seen many people argue against this simply by inserting some obviously non-existent thing in place of God in the statement of the argument, because there are suitable objections, namely that the Ontological Argument doesn't apply to those kinds of beings, and it only applies to ""that which none greater can be conceived"" i.e. God in this sense. Basically, St. Anselm will say to you Optimus Prime, perfect porridge or perfect pie people that there's no reason to conclude the existence of *those* things, because their perfection isn't the same as *God's*, but I leave it to you to further them!

I just barely got into a debate with him after i came out as an atheist. He gave me two stories, but as she was coming back to life her spirit was coming back to her body they saw a shoe on the roof of the hospital. So when they came back they said ""there's a shoe on the roof of this building"" and sure enough there it was!

My counter (in so many words) was that this sounded like bullshit. I asked for proof and he said ""The proof is the testimonies of the person who died and the medical personnel that checked on the roof."" I said they were lying. He said that i had no proof that they weren't telling the truth. I said he had no proof that they WERE telling the truth. He said that i'm denying that because it doesn't fit into my world view and that i'm closed minded. He then went on to tell me a different story. 

(well actually he went on to his experience while high and a 
""prompting"" that made him meet my mother when he was in college

This story is that an old woman died in a hospital and her son's came in and started talking about the will and what they wanted etc... BUT THEN~ The lady came back to life and promptly told them that she had heard all of what they had said when she was a spirit outside of her body.  I again said they were lying and he again said i had no proof

He also claims that people's spirits are the ""electricity in peoples bodies"" I asked him if that means that phones or TV's have spirits too. He said that phones aren't alive

Then he asked me how i can have morals if there is no god. I told him the golden rule. He asked what makes people follow it, much less asshole.) He said that if I believed that then why do i not believe that those people died and came back to life. (Including Jesus.) I told him that that had nothing to do with anything we were talking about and he said that he had stumped me. Then we got home (this arguement took place on a car ride) and we stopped arguing because i don't want make my little siblings listen to us yelling. He's fine with that though (I know this from experience seeing as i have older siblings.)

I found the best way to debate theists that believe in the personal biblical god is to keep steady on one single argument
What I usually ask are two main questions and I keep at it without allowing the conversation to sidetrack or flow into some other aspect of god's existence.

The two questions i usually ask are:
1)IN what way does God exist?How would you define his existence and in what way does it answer the definition of existence? 
2)Faith is defined as believing something is true without proof.
Why do you choose to believe something is true without proof(or without evidence as some will point out nothing can be 100% scientifically proven)?

Many times i have noticed that those willing to consider these two questions
Might be a fear of death or that otherwise life isn't fair without final judgment of the wicked and the good...
Of course if a person admits to himself his faith is rooted in emotional needs like that the road to doubting his faith is not far.

Some will try and say there are evidence of god's existence like a fulfillment of their prayers(some extraordinary coincidence they witnessed) or someone miraculously healing despite their doctor's prognosis.
This can be shaken by asking if The particular case could have been a coincidence and not god's work.
That god might have helped you with something else but could this particular case just be a coincidence.

Some background information - I am getting a masters degree in mathematics/theoretical physics at Cambridge. I was raised in a non-religious household and have always been an atheist

It seems quite clear to me that God by most conventional definitions does not exist. This is not the issue.

My question is why must we live our lives according to what we deduce to be true,perhaps making it far more interesting. 

I find that if one believes that one is very noble, but the general point is these rituals and beliefs can change one's mindset, and there is no reason to presume (as is believed in r/atheism) the results are always negative.

The fact that most religions contain sections that contradict modern morality isn't really an issue - one may simply pick the sections that one wants to keep and define that as their belief system. Hell, you can experience life from a new perspective (again, acting a part as it were).

As for accusations of cognitive dissonance

1333035382.0,rjcgv,Justification for God's 'moral and loving' actions,leeallan,22,3,53,"Hello fellow redditors! Here's the scoop, and I think it'd be extremely helpful in piecing it together perfectly!  To sum it up I asked him how he as a believer morally justifies all of God's immoral actions. If you can lend a hand debate the email! Thanks :)

&gt;on what basis do you even ask about moral issues in the Bible? You call the stories of war
 
&gt;This is very critical to my response. Let's say I do believe in the God of the Bible and that he is very just AND very moral. Then I view his actions might be very differently. You might say that I'm evading the question but really I'm not. I think that abortion is immoral, then don't have an intellectual foundation from which to even pose the question how I as a believer can morally justify the immoral actions of God. And if you do have a defined objective moral standard, how do you arrive at it?
 
&gt;My question to you is - how do you justify YOUR moral categories?
 
&gt;However
 
&gt;Here are my thoughts:
1. God is ruthless against sin and rebellion. (This is also the basis for the eternal judgement against an eternal God.) Sin is not just ""bad"" it is high treason against a Holy God. Therefore rebellion must be dealt with accordingly. Interestingly the nations and cities that were destroyed almost always had a chance to join Israel. In fact Exodus speaks about the many foreigners who were adopted into the nation of Israel as they went along through the desert (not the least of which was Rahab the prostitute from Jericho who hid the Hebrew spies - she is even mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus!)
 
&gt;2. Keep in mind the culture of the day. Compared to the other ancient kingdoms
 
&gt;3. I'm not sure that I can think of a time that God condoned rape - I think you may be mistaken here.
 
&gt;4. When it comes to slavery or even say divorce and polygamy
 
&gt;Two further points:
1. People often point out the bloody record of the Judeo Christian faith (and I don’t deny the very real violence that the Church did in the name of religion… it's disgusting) - but what must be remembered that the past century was the most bloody century in human history and almost every global conflict was at the hands of a dictator who was primarily atheistic in their philosophical worldview. This is very significant and brings me to point 2
 
&gt;2. Christianity has done more for the plight of the underprivileged

The Bible doesn't need to respond to reproaches of historical inaccuracies, because frankly it doesn't matter if anyone of it really happened.

 I've had this idea banging around in my head for a long time

 The only fair answer I have to that question is that Religion is the opposite of Science. It might utilize Science

 So what is Science? The answer jumps up immediately. Science is the study of life through the empirical lens. If it cannot be proven

 This means that Religion needs to be the un-empirical study of life. An attempt at grasping at the things in our existence that Science doesn't have authority over. Things like Love, Hate, Fear, ect. 

 What I find interesting about this, be definition, Religion is un-empirical. The phrase ""I can prove nothing, because I have nothing to prove"" seems to capture something for me. 
 
 What this means is that it allows us to pinpoint fundamentalism very easily, when one says ""There is a God and I can Prove it."" or ""There is No God and I can prove it."" They have become a fundamentalist. 
 
 This is because they are taking a Religious statement, because the idea of proving the existence of God is as unScientific as it gets, (If God was Proven, he/she would be Science. As if God is a person to be found in the first place.) and Religion must reject the idea simply for trying to prove something empirically. 

 What this leaves us with is an acceptance that Science holds vast wonders and truths about the universe that must be accepted, AND we have the ability to perceive fundamentalist thought, root it out, and remove it from the conversation entirely.

I'm posting here because I don't really have time to think of a response by myself.

Being an ex-muslim

I'm basically trying to explain to them why god doesnt exist. I've secrectly written many commentaries in my spare time on religious books and I sent those to them. Those commentaries are extensive so they haven't really gotten to them yet.

A little backround knowledge. Three of them are doctors, I'm studying to be a chemical engineer at pittsburgh university. Not sure if any of that was important, but its just incase.


Also
These are the emails. I will include the names of who sent what.



ME(Haroon):
I just got your voicemail and you asked these questions:
Why do you have these questions? What is your concept? ( I Assume you mean about the existence of God) What are your feelings? ( I assume you mean about god) What do you think? (I'm going to combine this question with the one above it) Have you studied other books?

First, then you would have to provide evidence. You cannot require the husband to give evidence to prove that he did not kill his wife, that burden of proof is on the accuser. In the same way, everyone is born an atheist and has no religious beliefs. Then religious people make the claim that God exists and then the child has to make a choice. IN the same way, theists have to provide evidence for the existence of God. And there is no proof of God existence, so the claim that theists make about God is invalid. For this reason, no one can ask someone to provide ""proof that god does not exist"" because then would we also have to provide proof that unicorns don't exist? No

The reason I have these questions is because I see no proof in the existence of God. In the same way, because it says so right here on this napkin"". That isnt very credible but that is essentially what the Quran is doing. The quran is saying, ""I'm right because I said so"". If someone published a scientific article about a new discovery and the only proof that they give of this discovery is ""Because I said it was true in the article"" no one would give it another glance. Why do religious people go to their holy books when they are just as invalid?
So my feelings about God existing are the same feelings I have with unicorns and fairies. There is no proof of their existence, Hadrat Mirza Bashir Ahmad could not make coherent points.

And yes, then how is it even OPEN to interpretation? In other words, how would anyone mistake the words of God for something else if the book is indeed perfect? All of that proves that the Quran isnt perfect. By that conclusion you come to verse:

[54:18] And indeed We have made the Qur’an easy to understand and to remember. But is there anyone who would receive admonition?

This also not just goes into Arabic. The second line uses the word ""anyone"". So whether you speak english, the Quran and the word of God should be easy to understand. We know now that that particular verse is incorrect because apparently the Quran isn't easy to understand. Then what else might be wrong in the Quran? If the Quran is perfect and easy to understand for everyone, then why are there questions about the Quran? Why do we need commentaries?



USMAN:

Good to hear from you. Hope you are doing well. These are good questions (assuming they are in good faith in an attempt to learn) and we should definitely engage them.

First of all I think we have to address the scope of the problem. I think we have to acknowledge that there is no way to absolutely, then there would be no one who would need convincing. There are many things that are very much suggested like man made climate change but because there is no one test for it, people can dispute it. So all we can do is provide convincing evidence that very strongly indicates the existence of a superior being and take people to that point but the rest is up to them.
I think we have to make a distinction between the arguments for the existence of god and the arguments for the veracity of the Quran. We can look at the existence of god with many different arguments - from philosophy (ontologic argument)

Richard Dawkins and others have argued that natural selection explains evolution completely but others point to irreducibly complex systems (such as the clotting cascade) that cannot be explained by natural selection. I think the symmetry of the universe is too elegant to be a random phenomenon. Mathematics is said to be the language of the universe and if theory is not elegant

As far as the questions about the Quran go, physics are all independent of the Quran. However it is the moral teaching and the proof of revelation that is perfected in the Quran. Your friend in making a strawman argument - stating incorrectly that we believe a feeble idea that he can then knock down. Khalifa Rabia's book ""Revelation, rationality"" is a an excellent work not because it introduces new arguments but because it shows how the verses in the Quran are applicable to science and predicted events - it offers logical arguments showing the truth of the Quran. As far as ""anyone"" being able to understand it, the phrase ""men of understanding"" is often used to describe those who take heed- this person's arguments strike me as superficial - ask him to be more specific in his critique.

There is much more to say but let's start here.


ASAD:


Hope all is well with you at Pitt. I see that you are keeping yourself busy
As Usman bhai rightly pointed out the questions you raise are very important. One must get satisfactory answers to them

This quest of yours could take some time until you are fully convinced and believe in a God. You are very intelligent in your reasoning and logical skills but just keep an open mind as we proceed with this endeavor. Keep searching and if you are sincere in your desire - you will attain it. If you are just trying to play an intellectual game and outsmart the 'ignorant' religious thinkers then it will be a difficult journey.

Let us begin with broadly defining what is meant by God. Let us assume God does exist. What is He or Who is He? I attribute God to be a CONSCIOUS BEING. Would you agree with that assessment? What does the word God represent to you?

What kind of proof would convince you that there might be a God? Are you looking for some scientific proof, something tangible...?
I would try to address these general principles first before getting into the Holy Quran and what it says. The Holy Quran itself is a great proof of the existence of God

One suggestion I would make for you, but please give it a try. What have you got to lose? Every night before you go to sleep, the very last thing you should do is ask Allah or God:
People tell me that there is a God. He is the Master of the Universe, I am in search of You. If You exist help me find You and lead me to You. 

Provide for me some proof that I know You exist.

The [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_Theory) about integral theory reads more like an advertisement than anything.

Thankfully talk pages exist and from there

2. [Kazlev](http://www.kheper.net/topics/Wilber/Wilber_on_biological_evolution.html), appears to still respect the general idea behind integral theory as a whole.

More telling for me than anything was the writing from Wilber himself when confronted with criticism:

&gt;Publicly, those of us with graduate degrees in science who have professionally practiced it -- don't believe hardly any of its crucial tenets. [...] Instead of a religious preacher like Dawkins, start with something like Michael Behe's Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution. And then guess what? Neo-Darwinian theory can't explain shit. Deal with it. 

The problem now is that despite knowing some of the flaws in the theory and most certainly the flaws in Wilber's character, I'm extremely reluctant to even open one of Wilber's books at the moment because so far, everything about this has reeked of pseudoscience. I brought up Wilber's ridiculous writing above and she accused me of discarding the entire theory because of his misunderstanding of evolution.

Recently there was a post on Reddit asking how we can trust the Bible when it advocates slavery. It's a common sight to see people bring out verses from the Bible that seem absolutely ludicrous (not touching pig skins, to understand where I'm coming from, a little background:

The way I was taught is that the New and Old Testament are labeled differently for a reason. Yes, including Leviticus which has all of the orthodox laws in them. These laws were designed to protect and organize this group of Jewish nomads and to keep their paths straight in a world full of polygamy, religious cults and the like. Most of these laws have been proven today to have had scientific merit at the time, though the Jews obviously weren't privy to this. (http://www.ccg.org/english/s/p015.html)

Jesus came to fulfill the law (Matthew 5:17) which included a bunch of prophecies throughout various books of the OT. Once that was fulfilled

I know I'm getting a little lecture-y, the sphere was extended to include non-Jews and no longer required the old law, but instead the new law, which is given to us in the New Testament (Sermon on the Mount, parables, etc). Those are the verses we're held to. The Old Testament is still there as a way to learn and to see how God's plan for his people has moved through time. Just my personal belief. 

So I still eat pork and I'll be around my wife when she's on her period (even if I don't particularly want to be) and still feel good that I'm not committing any sin for it. New Testament verses are what I'm held to

The term refers to End User Licensing Agreements that come with software - the ones no one reads; we just scroll to the bottom and click ""Agree.""  Presumably, these non-bible reading Christians are doing the same with the bible.

Now, ah... adherents.  I strongly believe that what we'll find is that there would be a significant number of people who would self-identify as atheists, but wouldn't have more than the foggiest notion of empiricism or logic.  They'd spout ""science brought us vaccines and computers, so I'm an atheist"" and other such things, but when pushed for details, they'd be as clueless as the 60% of Americans who can't name 10 commandments.

* Con: Atheists don't have the group support structures that most religions do.  Even if most Christians don't read their bibles

* Neutral: Logic and reasoning.  If creationism has taught us anything, with faith and holy books is that *anyone's* interpretation is as valid as anyone else's.  That's how divine revelation ""works.""  Atheists I think assume that because science *doesn't* work that way, that we'll have an advantage with these EULA atheists.  I don't think that will be the case at all. I suspect even when provably wrong a large number of people for whom that proof goes over their heads will ignore it - faith in another answer or not.

So that's my position: for all the flack we give Christians about their members who aren't even sure what they believe - but by God they'll vote for it! - I don't think we'll be in much better of a position ourselves just because we're Atheists.

* God is a pretty tricky subject for me. I don't completely reject the idea of ""higher powers that be, because 1) God is not a person, it seems almost too informal to refer to God that way (although that's obviously why it's capitalized, but nonetheless) and 2) giving a figure like that gender also kills me.

* I've never found any need for an abstract figure like ""God"" to guide me or do whatever it is that God supposedly does (see, to the extent that I've learned about it in Hebrew school/the bit of church I've attended, but am open to learning about others. For instance, the Greeks gods fascinate, as well as figures like Buddha, who seem to represent more of a lifestyle and guidance than a belief practice.
*Prayer is a lovely concept to me, mainly because I don't find I have anyone/thing to whom I would pray. 

* I've never called myself an atheist, I don't want to just outright reject every religion &amp; their associations, because I feel like someday, maybe, I could accept one. EDIT: Not the best wording. I personally feel like just slapping on the label atheist would stop me from seeking out other religions. So, I'm not opposed to it at all, but I don't want it just yet.

 As atheists, non-arbitrary reason to behave morally.

 At the end of my post here I am going to ask: On what foundations can the atheist ground their morality

1. There is no supernatural dimension to reality

2. Human beings are the result of evolution by natural selection. They are the result of a long history of random mutations and selection pressures.

3. The human brain has been just one more product of natural selection

4. Some portion of human cognition is the result of shaping by our environment. Some moral judgments may be the result of whatever culture we are born into. 

5. All moral feelings are the result of some mixture of 3 &amp; 4.

 Now, I think the atheist is committed to claiming that the source of morality lies in our evolutionary history and particular cultural upbringing. But the problem, as I see it, is that neither 3 or 4 offer any non-arbitrary reason for being good or bad. I shall offer an example.

 Incest is universally looked upon with disgust among all cultures in the world. This makes perfect sense from an evolutionary point of view. Incest was mal-adaptive, we might be here on reddit claiming that incest was the height of moral good.

 Similarly, but only because we have a genetic component as well.

 In summary: Atheist morality is either the result of some arbitrary evolutionary history, we need to pretend these rules are sacred. I will agree that moral feelings are conducive to promoting the happiness of others. But why should I care about any of those things? The theist says ""I care about those things because of God"". Is the atheist forced to say ""I care about those things because I am biologically and environmentally programmed to do so""?

The picture in question: http://imgur.com/DzXNq

***Him***: A bit out of context I'd say.

***Me***: And what exactly is the context here?

***Him***: The context here is made to look like this quote from Ephesians supports slavery, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;"" ""Servant"" in the original King James translation context refers to an employee who is paid for his/her service. It suggests that one should commit to working earnestly and whole heartily for his employer as one of faith would work to please God.

***Me***:  The King James version is a notoriously bad translation, most biblical scholars agree that ""servant"" in the KJV refers to slave, and *not* an employee, well, the non-apologist ones at least. It is a complete mis-translation. So, in this particular verse the term slave is totally correct.

Also, in other translations they are much more upfront and just use the word slave. Not to mention the provisions for sex-slavery in 21:7-11. In Leviticus 25:44-46, it makes it very clear that people can be bought and sold as property, in so much that they are inherited by children when their parents die. Exodus 21:20-21 is also pretty clear that if you beat your slave, and he doesn't die, it's a.ok because he is your property.

***Him***:  Not sure I have the energy to share an opinion on your whole response. I will say that if one reads all of Eph:6 it does also address children to parents and parents to children as well as servant to master and master to servant. It certainly does not support in that final statement about master to servant (slave) that abuse is acceptable. So I guess we can agree

***Me***: Exodus 21:20-21 “Anyone who beats their male or female slave with a rod must be punished if the slave dies as a direct result

How does this *not* say anything but, eternal god give laws to humans (as is the case in Leviticus and Exodus) regulating slavery instead of condemning it? Why would Jesus use parables with metaphores of slaves being beaten by their master (in Luke 12, 44-47 I believe) and not take the opportunity to be like ""Yo guys, God says owning people as property is wrong"". The bible does not condemn slavery anywhere in the Bible, and constantly makes references to slaves being property. Even Paul was ok with it, in his Epistle to Titus. Given provisions from God himself, he clearly didn't have a problem with it. So maybe Ephesians is out of context, but the meaning of the picture is still right.

And let's be honest

***Him***:  The argument is not weather the Bible Condones anything. Its weather God does. We're also reading texts that are thousands of years old and take place in an era where social benefits

Slaves, employees...no matter what you called them were protected only by the integrity of masters.

The circumstances of how those slaves were acquired

So Righteous men, all are equal regardless I social status.

Sex slave? No, not does it suggest there was consent. What it does say, is that in the instance that does happen, this is your duty. Just like beating or killing a slave, you have an obligation and as per the scriptures below, you the master will be punished.

""If a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod and he dies at his hand
""If a man strikes the eye of his male or female slave, he shall let him go free on account of his tooth."" (Exodus 21:26-27)
""He who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death."" (Exodus 21:12)
""Six days you are to do your work, as well as your stranger, may refresh themselves. (Exodus 23:12)
Do not slander a slave to his master
'Now if a man lies carnally with a woman who is a slave acquired for another man, however, be put to death, because she was not free. (Leviticus 19:20)
""You shall not hand over to his master a slave who has escaped from his master to you. (Deuteronomy 23:15)
'If a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to you that he sells himself to you, he and his sons with him, and shall go back to his family, that he may return to the property of his forefathers. 'For they are My servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt; they are not to be sold in a slave sale. 'You shall not rule over him with severity, but are to revere your God. (Leviticus 25:39-43)
""If you buy a Hebrew slave
He who pampers his slave from childhood Will in the end find him to be a son. (Proverbs 29:21)

You know your stuff bud

***Me***: Sorry the late reply

I would think that weather the Bible condones slavery is synonymous with whether God condones it. Why would God inspire righteous men to write books, misygony, racism, etc... in it, it's better to simply disregard it altogether as a source of moral guidance. We've evolved way passed it as a species and it's crazy that people in 2012 still cling to a book of iron-age fairy tales to guide their lives.

Slaves, being protected only by the integrity of their masters is the entire point. They are subjugated to the will of another person. How and when they were acquired is completely irrelevant. Like I said before, if these men were supposedly inspired by God, and God doesn't approve of slavery why would he not just be like ""Yo guys, owning people as property as wrong"". Instead, we get rules and regulations, infering approval. It doesn't matter if masters get punished for mistreating their slaves, human rights and equality did not exist yet then it should be the responsibilty of an eternal

God should ""inspired"" these so-called righteous men to not have slaves in the first place.

Sex-slave vs ""slave who a master has had sex with""

Regarding the wall of scripture:

Exodus 21:20 - You're forgetting the verse *immediately after* that says that if he survives

Exodus 21:26-27 -- Probably the only defensible provision in the entire lot though it is strange to put emphasis on just the eyes and teeth. Then again

Exodus 21:12 -- Basic thou-shalt-not kill stuff

Exodus 23:12 -- Oh how nice

Proverbs 30:10 -- Oh no, and doesn't seem to have any relevance to The Law.

Leviticus 19:20 -- This is a strange verse, this just more so). One question I would ask is does this work when a girl is raped? If she is, and she's a virgin, do we follow Deutoronomy 22:28-29 and force her to marry her rapist instead of the man she is engaged to? Should also go great with Deuteronomy 22: 13-21, where we stone girls to death that aren't virgins on their wedding night.

Deuteronomy 23:15 -- Well that's nice

Leviticus 25:39-43 -- Oh

Exodus 21:2 -- So here's a thought experiment: Let's assume God doesn't approve of slavery (that is your claim, you shouldn't treat people as property"" he says ""If you buy slaves, it's only for 6 years"". Sound logic right there. Also, weren't the Hebrews God's chosen people? It seems odd to allow them to become slaves, especially to eachother.

Proverbs 29:21 -- Seems to be a mistranslation actually. My NIV says ""will turn out to be insolent"". Other translations I've looked up on-line agree mostly, just more random poetry.

At this point, I feel my point has been made crystal clear. I do appreciate the mature exchange of ideas though, most people I discuss religion with that are on the other side usually devolves very quickly.

1332522824.0,ra778,A LONG post from a Christian about morality and the validity of the bible: Looking for responses. ,crushmastac,22,3,39,"I'm an atheist myself and I've been engaged with this person in a debate about secular morality and the fallibility of the bible

Here is his post

---

This is a reply to a FB friend as a part of an ongoing discussion we are having. And [me] - I am sincerely sorry for how long this took. I've been dealing with a lot and this kept being relegated to the background!

There are a number of preliminary considerations that must be laid in order to adequately answer your question. Your question, contradict the ethic of modern Christianity, how can it be said to be the foundation for Christian ethics?” While that’s a good question that needs to be answered, I don’t think it gets to the heart of our debate. So what I’d like to do is broaden the scope of the question I seek to answer, and in so doing I hope I will answer the question above. The question I want to answer is, “How does Christianity account for a transcendent morality?” You are right in your instincts that, “The Bible says so” is not a sufficient answer to that question, no one who has given the subject much thought argues for that.
 
 Before I begin

1) I am not arguing that assent to the Lordship of God is necessary for humans to know what moral behavior is, it is essential to my argument that all men have an understanding of a transcendent standard of right and wrong and act in ways that reflects their knowledge of this standard. 
 
2) I am not arguing that an individual can ever arrive at an absolute, there are situation where the right thing is obvious, and others where the answer is a little more difficult to see and we must use careful reasoning to arrive at a conclusion.
 
3) I am not arguing that the Bible is a comprehensive moral guide in that it removes the necessity for humans to engage in moral reasoning, the Bible is an essential component of right moral reasoning, but it is not “How to be a Good Person for Dummies” by the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The Bible is a sufficient and true moral guide, but it does not address every moral contingency.
 
So if a Christian understanding of morality does not start with, the most important thing is that it does not start with man as an independent self-governing creature. John Locke, one of the fathers of empiricism, articulated the idea that an infant is a *Tabula Rasa* – or a blank slate. He explained that all of our morals, values and principles are ‘written’ on the blank slate by culture, upbringing, experience, through our sensory experience. I think that this is more or less the way most people nowadays think. Christianity rejects this notion of man as a blank slate. Instead, build and love – they do those things because it is in their nature and is a reflection of how God made them. Upbringing, I was taught English
 
Narrowing this to the area of our discussion, we have all been created by the same God with the same understanding of morality. Secondly, Christianity teaches that this knowledge is of a real thing. That is, we feel and act as if there is real right and wrong in the world, and indeed there is a real right and wrong in the world that corresponds to our knowledge. God has created us in such a way that we recognize the morality that exists. 
 
One does not need to argue to the vast majority of people that eating a baby for dinner is wrong. We *just* know that it is wrong. That much you and I agree upon. Even in the cases where someone grossly violates the sense of morality that has been given to us – the Holocaust or something – they seek to justify their actions in such a way that it doesn’t violate that moral code. When someone is defending a murder,” – they will seek to explain how in their particular case it was acceptable or right. Of course, the particulars vary from culture to culture – they may have differing notions of what constitutes murder, for instance – but no society exist in which murder is good and taking care of people is wrong. So whether we want to argue about if God put that knowledge there, or evolutionary processes, we agree on the first part – people have a generally consensual view of morality that we view as generally binding on each member of the human race. We disagree about the particulars and the application, but except in the case of those with severe mental issues, and right to help him when he is in trouble.
 
It’s this second part that causes all the difficulties for any non-theistic position. It is perfectly consistent within a Christian worldview for God to have moral standards and to impart the knowledge of those standards. Our understanding of morality, they have great difficulty in explaining how these genetic and cultural developments translate into duty or obligation once we are aware that they are genetic and cultural developments. There may be a benefit to the species as a whole, but even this concept is lacking because benefit for the species =/= moral obligation. Indeed, certain things that might be beneficial for the species as a whole, from a survival perspective, are things we recognize to be wrong, such as killing mentally retarded people. But a critique of atheistic ethics is not possible in length
 
So the first part of a Christian understanding of ethics is that all people have a basic knowledge of right and wrong, and develops as a person gets older. The Bible is not even necessary at this point. We don’t need the Bible to tell us that murder is wrong – it’s part of the law of God that is written on our hearts. The Bible itself makes that argument, when it says “For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.” (Rom 2:14 ESV) Even the people without the Mosaic law understand the moral precepts commanded by them
 
So – why do we need the Bible? Well, then it would be rather absurd to say that God can justly punish those who have been given a standard by which they can be judged. The Bible is many things, but if I can simplify greatly, the main thing that the Bible is about is God, which by extension tells us about man. That might seem like an obvious answer but it is important because many people, Christians and non-Christians alike, approach the Bible as if it is a rule book that, helps us be good people. Instead, such as God’s interactions with his creation, there is much more to be said on this point
 
Perhaps the most important aspect of God’s self-revelation, to put it in un-philosophical terms, he is the boss and he gets to make the rules. Again, you can mock this idea as primitive and not befitting modern man, but if God exists, it is not inconsistent to say that he is Lord. A necessary fact that proceeds from God's lordship, both logically and biblically, our consciences
 
So, but not all the supposed examples of flawed morality are comparable or can be answered in the same way. Your basic argument was that the Bible presents an inconsistent foundation for ethical reasoning. So, as I see it, there are three different areas where critics assert the Bible is flawed or inconsistent, and I will briefly address all three.
 
First, ever, approached Scripture with a “If it's in the Bible it's OK!” attitude. The Bible describes some pretty wicked actions while at the same time providing the basis for condemning those actions. This point seems so obvious, but apparently people somehow think, for example, the Bible is endorsing rape simply because it describes rape. So that takes care of a great number of the 'moral' objections against the Bible – which, incidentally, and attempts to reduce it to a simple
 
Secondly, this is not some doctrine the Church came up with later in order to be able to ignore the commandments we were embarrassed by in order to come up with a system we felt more comfortable with – sort of like Einstein's infamous, arbitrary 'fudge factor' which he inserted into his theory to produce the result he felt more comfortable with. The difference between the OT and NT is that God's people in the OT were identified with a particular national group (Israel), and they had a particular penal code. Now agree or disagree with it, the point is that certain commandments were particularly suited to that nation, in that time and place. It's easy to make certain laws out to be stupid or barbaric, but intellectual honesty requires us to inform ourselves of the historical realities of the time. Of course, but I'll give one example.
 For instance, well, here's my 10 year old son and he won't clean up his room. Should we kill him?” Well, in reality, this wasn't a matter of parents being able to arbitrarily murder their children, but a matter of national security and identity. The society at the time was highly patriarchal and cohesive, and fathers were the national leaders – so when an (adult) son publicly defied and rebelled against his father, a nation without strong identity and cohesiveness would be destroyed by its neighbours. Furthermore, the entire NATION would carry out the sentence. The penal code was thus partially instituted to ensure the cohesiveness and survival of the nation. So part of the reason we don't follow those laws now is because we are no longer a nation living in that particular time
 
What I don't want to do, the idea behind the prohibition of tattooing and mutilation of flesh in Leviticus was because the Israelites were supposed to be separate unto God, and tattooing and mutilation were facets of the pagan religions surrounding them. That is no longer the case, but the principle of being separate  unto God is still affirmed in the NT. We no longer stone homosexuals or adulterers because the church does not have the legal authority to do so because we do not live in a theocracy, but that does not mean adultery is now endorsed. But neither does that mean that it was wrong for the theocratic state of Israel to carry out those sentences – it's just that we need to live in a historical awareness of the circumstances when reading the Bible (an awareness which the Bible provides, I might add.) Many of the laws (like seafood, tattoos, etc...) were dealing with particular features of society and surrounding religions at the time, and thus we see what those laws were teaching us without having to adhere to the particular way they were applied in an ancient context.

Nor should the New Testament (NT) be construed as a shift in morality. As I have already stated, it makes them even MORE difficult to follow so that we will understand we cannot follow them perfectly. Jesus' Sermon on the Mount is the most famous example of this. The point of both the law in the OT and the NT is to set God's holy standards in front of his people so that they understand their sin and rely on God for forgiveness of those sins and the ability and desire to follow after him.
 
There was a third part of your objection, malevolent God. Unfortunately, there are some who call themselves Christians who perpetuate this image of God as being mean and nasty in the OT, but nice and gentle in the NT. Well, the Bible is not a children's storybook and the reality is a bit more complicated than that. If you take God's actions out of the context of the rest of the Bible, sure, you can portray him as a bloodthirsty monster. But put into the balance of the rest of Scripture, the fundamental idea of Scripture is that God is Lord. One of the things that attends his lordship is his authority to act as supreme Judge. When the Bible portrays God as angry or 'covered in the blood of his enemies', God waited over 140 years to give the people a chance to change.
 
The Bible actually doesn't really see it as a problem that God kills people; the real theological problem is that God hasn't simply wiped us all out. Throughout the Bible, until ultimately, Jesus Christ takes the full punishment for all who will repent of their rebellion and trust him as Lord. Those who continue to take his patience for granted will not always enjoy his patience; justice is waiting for them.  The important thing with all this is that God has reserved this right to judge in this way for himself alone. The Bible is pretty clear that people do not have the right to arbitrarily do God's work for him – for the very reason that we are all equally condemned under his law. There is certain authority vested to governments by God to govern the affairs of nations and to carry out justice as far as it relates to human relationships, but the judgment of nations and individuals (and ability to carry out his sentence) belongs to God alone.
 
Obviously, insofar as it reveals God as our creator and us as his creation, and the moral relationship that exists there.
 
So, each of these answers could be further explored and substantiated in particular cases, but this is my general defence. The moral compass of the Bible is in fact consistent with itself, from beginning to end. Of course, if one insists on approaching the Bible with the mindset of a twelve-year old, yes, it can seem to say some silly things. However, the Bible's message is remarkably consistent. I'm not saying that an adult will automatically (or ever) accept the Bible's claims for itself, rather than what you WANT the Bible to say, is full of people who seek to be intellectually honest and ask the same questions that you do.

**I. Proof that the Gospels were written by eyewitnesses**

*A. Internal Evidence

1. The style of writing in the Gospels is simple and alive
2. Moreover, Luke must have an early date, which speaks for its authenticity.
3. The Gospels also show an intimate knowledge of Jerusalem prior to its destruction in A.D. 70…. The Gospels are full of proper names, historical events, and customs and opinions of that time.
4. Jesus’ prophecies of the destruction of Jerusalem must have been written prior to Jerusalem’s fall, the so-called prophecies of its destruction that were really written after the city was destroyed would not have made that event appear so closely connected with the end of the world. Hence the Gospels must have been written prior to A.D. 70.
5. The stories of Jesus’ human weaknesses and of the disciples’ faults also bespeak of the Gospels’ accuracy.
6. Furthermore, such as we might expect from forgers. 
7. The Gospels do not contain anachronisms; the authors appear to have been first-century Jews who were witnesses of the events.

We may conclude that there is no more reason to doubt that the Gospels come from the traditional authors than there is to doubt that the works of Philo or Josephus are authentic

*B. External Evidence*

1. The disciples must have left *some* writings
2. There were many eyewitnesses who were still alive when the books were written who could testify whether they came from their purported authors or not.
3. The extra-biblical testimony unanimously attributes the Gospels to their traditional authors, the Shepherd of Hermas, all the way up to Eusebius in A.D. 315… Theophilus, Hippolytus, Origen, Quadratus, Irenaeus, Polycarp, Cyprian, Cyril
4. With a single exception

**II. Proof that the Gospels we have today are the same Gospels originally written**

A.	because of the need for instruction and personal devotion

B.	In fact

C.	The text has also remained unmarred by heretical additions. The abundance of manuscripts over a wide geographical distribution demonstrates that the text was transmitted with only trifling discrepancies. The differences that do exist are quite minor and are the result of unintentional mistakes. 

D.	The quotations of the New Testament books in the early church Fathers all coincide.

E.	The Gospels could not have been corrupted without a great outcry on the part of all orthodox Christians.

F.	No one could have corrupted *all* the manuscripts.

G.	There is no precise time when the falsification would have occurred, the New Testament books are cited by the Church Fathers in regular and close succession. The text could not have been falsified before all external testimony, since then the apostles were alive and could repudiate such tampering.

H.	The text of the New Testament is every bit as good as the text of the classical works of antiquity… To repudiate the textual parity of the Gospels would be to reverse all the rules of criticism and to reject all the works of antiquity

Thank you for the taking the time to read through. My hope is to have open

TL;DR Richard Purtill summarizes the textual case:

&gt; Many events which are regarded as firmly established historically have (1) far less documentary evidence than many biblical events, and (4) the surviving copies are much earlier than those on which our evidence for secular history is based. If the biblical narratives did not contain accounts for miraculous events… biblical history would probably be regarded as much more firmly established than most of the history of, say, classical Greece and Rome.",,False,,False,t3_pb6tt
1326143796.0,o9sue,Counterpoints to TheoreticalBullshit's structure of the Kalam argument to prove God does not exist.,I3lindman,24,8,86,"[Here is a video posted by youtube user TheoreticalBullshit

I submit the following three points in rejection of the argument from the Judeo-Christian perspective:  

1) To start, the conclusion drawn is accurate, through the implied conlusion is a strawman.  The argument is limited to stating the first law of thermodynamics (conservation of energy).  For reasons stated in the argument, it does not apply to metaphysical principles, only physical ones.  For example, I have created an idea in the form of this post and the content it contains, which represents a metaphysical object.  This act of creation of a metaphysical object is not relevant to the argument.  Therefor it follows that the argument only serves to determine the existence or non-existence of God in a physical form and bounded by the laws of physics

**The conclusion that God does not exist in a physical form

So on this point, ""God does not exist in a physical form and is not bounded by the laws of physics.""   

2) The construction of the argument is logically invalid as it excludes the universe from beginning to exist utilizing the framework he establishes.  

Using the example that TheoreticalBullshit cites, we are confronted with this fact:  [There is zero net energy in the universe.](http://www.astrosociety.org/pubs/mercury/31_02/nothing.html)  

As such, that ""The universe began to exist"", and therefore the argument is logically invalid.  The criteria established are so strict that nothing can be said to have ""begun to exist"".**  

3) The exclusion of an alteration of physical form as a lack of causality to existence is irrational.  Ignoring the logical violation demonstrated in point #2, a male and female engaging in sex with the intent to have a child would qualify as caused existence.  Even more simplistically, simply speaking would rationally qualify as causing a physical phenomena to exist where it did not before.  To compare this with the original argument, the extreme limitation to violation of conservation of energy as being required to warrant causation of existence serves no useful purpose.

Hello

Against my better judgement I had a quick look at your rather sad website. Having found an hour to spare before evening worship

Let's look at just some of the stuff they stated:

1. ""Appeal to authority, Krauss, Greene, Stenger, etc). If he wants to play the illogical game of ""count the experts"" he is going to lose, the only half religious prominent physicist I can think of is Dyson (deist).""

Then this guy hasn't looked far. Look up Prof John Polkinghorne FRS (Anglican) Werner Heisenberg (Lutheran), Mariano Artigas, C F Von Weizenacher, Alan Sandage, Stanley Jaki (Catholic), Ian Barbour, Prof Russell Stannard, Antonino Zichichi, George Ellis, Stephen Barr

It's interesting how the only people who claim """"Appeal to authority
That's why those with NO authority come up with one name

"" I am myself a Christian, educates children in moral responsibility, and worships God in its own fashion.""

Some deist I think.

2. ""This whole section is an exercise in longwinded red herring.""

No evidence given for this.

3. ""What hundreds of constants? There really aren't all that many unique constants as most of them are the result of other things ""

To quote Wikipedia (something I rarely use, a few percent change in the value of the fine structure constant would be enough to eliminate stars like our Sun. This has prompted attempts at anthropic explanations of the values of some of the dimensionless fundamental physical constants.""

Just a few:

Gravitational constant G, Panck Constant, electron constant e0, Boltzman's Constant, elemental charge e, fine structure constant a, speed of light in vacuo, Faraday Constant, mu, Impedance of a vacuul Zo

""There really aren't all that many unique constants ""??? I

3. ""Yawn. A boring and predictable argument loaded with blinding by science.""

In other words

4. ""You cannot say that our universe is special

Wrong. Can you name ONE piece of irrefutable evidence that is repeatable and verifiable that proves multiverses exist. There is none. All speculation.

5""....... configuration that could possibly lead to life

The point missed entirely. If constants could change or somehow 'compensate' for each other so that life could exist within a huge range of constant values

6. (on the necessity of carbon as a prerequisite for life) ""At this point I'm giving up on this section. This guy rambles too much and just keeps repeating the same kind of crap that has been repeated over and over. ""

Yup. He cannot refute it so he insults. Good try. I suggest that this guy actually address why carbon is the only element in the universe that can produce life and why carbon exists against all odds. Simply dismissing this and calling it 'crap' is a cop-out

7"" but He continues to attempt to blind by science

Wrong. It seems that it is all to easy to blind this person with science if he cannot even address the carbon problem.Moreover we DO know the odds.

8. (Those are the ONLY two alternatives.)""False dichotomy

Well, surely? Or a fourth? or fifth? As this pseudo-intelligent ignoramus done this? No. Why not? Because there isn't one, no matter how much blustering is done. And how do I know there isn't one? because if there were someone here, no doubt, would have mentioned it. 

9. (Christians (and Jews and Muslims) have always accepted an 'eternal' God.) ""No they haven't.""

Really? You see

I find your insistence on MY producing chapter and verse evidence, inconsistent and unfair. 

10. ""At light speed

Don't blame me for this, time slowed down so that at the speed of light time is frozen. This time dilation was proved as fact originally by measuring mesons and their travel through the atmosphere from space.

11. ""No it doesn't

More insult. Ignored.

12. Fuck these silly goddamn beliefs and shitty illogical arguments.

Nice. Is THIS what you call 'refutation' of my argument? Are you for real? Or are you an idiot? Do you REALLY consider filth like this as 'refutation'??

13 ""I seriously laughed at his dismissal of multiverses. He is basically saying multiverses can't be the answer because we can't test them. Therefore it has to be God.""

Well
And where did I suggest this alone was 'proof' of God? A straw man argument if ever I saw it.

14. He has a point though -- we ARE unjustified in asserting multiverses are the answer

Absolutely. But we need to look at the probability. The probability of the universe being by chance is almost zero. And if not by chance, the ONLY alternative is design. And if design, then a designer. Youy cannot wriggleout of this fact.

15. ""Take a deck of cards, say, 14 more times, noting the order each time. The probability that this order of 15 decks happened is (1/52!)15, which is equal to about 101018, which is 10750 times more improbable than his estimate for the constants of the universe. And yet it happened.""

Nonsense. This is what being ignorant does to you.
When you deal a deck of cards out to people every permutation of the cards has the same chance as every other. But in playing a game of cards, Ace through to King of spades, Ace through to King of Clubs, Ace through to King of Diamonds. I shuffle the cards, and then deal. The chances of them coming up in this order is 1 in 2,235,197,900,000

16 ""Improbable things happen all the time. The improbability of something does not give you ANY justification for making up something to explain it.""

More nonsense. 

We are not talking here about dealing one hand of cards , after shuffling between deals, time and time again. 

17. ""He also keeps repeating this horrible fallacy: You can refute this if you wish, and which cannot be refuted.""NO. I do not need a valid alternative to dismiss something you just made up. ""I don't know"" is a valid answer.""

At last someone has been a little more honest. Though I have 'made up' nothing (everything I stated can be verified scientifically and mathematically) at least this person suggested that he 'didn't know'. And

18. ""I just hope you know he didn't write all of that. Much of the argument he likely copied and pasted from a blog.""

Sorry to disappoint

19.""What existed before the big bang? Another universe? Nothing? Was there a previous universe that collided with ours? Did ours implode, if ever. Postulating a god on the possibility that there was indeed nothing before the big bang is nothing more than a giant ""what if"" statement.""

Well

20. ""Also

Chemistry, Theology. Are they suitable for you? Or would you have preferred my degrees to be in Media Studies, Origami and Needlework?

21. ""This guy is SERIOUSLY not worth the time of day. He's so incredibly full of himself that there is no argument on Earth that would even cause him to pause for a moment and think. Besides, 2 degrees, who took an early retirement (read: got fired for trying to push creationism in public schools). ""

LOL 1. People retire early for many reasons - not least because they answer a call. Like John Polkinghorne, I believe, in which the Big Bang is part of the physics syllabus. Or there was the last time I examined students for the Oxford Examinations Board. Oh, and, as I have made very clear time and time again, I am no Creationist. This particular idiot cannot refute anything so he resorts to a straw man argument against young-earth Creationism (which I am equally concerned about) , and insults directed towards me as an amazingly obvious straw man argument.

At this point I have given up. Much of the rest is of a similar ilk

I have only one apology to make. I did make the comment that the people here were a bunch of 'saddos' I was wrong. Reading through some of the comments here reminded me of my old university days when we would prop up the student's union bar and spend an entertaining hour eavesdropping on the leftie brigade with their Afghan coats and string vests plotting the revolution. They were predominantly from the Sociology department that occupied half a top floor of a large academic block that housed the Chemistry department on the lower floors. It was, the university would not lose anything of any great value.

Looking at these responses reminds me of these revolution plotters - all hot air, and I apologise. No, they're not. They're a bunch of THICK saddos.

I think I have done with you. I've spent far more time here than I wanted to

I just hope and pray that one day you will come to your senses . But if not, why the interest in God here? Why not debate the existence of Robin Hood? Is God, like in the case of atheist C S Lewis's experience before he was ""dragged kicking and screaming to become Christianity's most reluctant convert"" actually trying to TELL you something?

Good day

&gt;Me: Hi

*I really just wanted to clear that up.*

&gt;Him: OK

*So far so good.*

&gt;Me: Good idea! Then I guess let me know if HE has any questions.

*One week later.*

&gt;Him: I had an interesting discussion with my friends about what you said and I think we all agreed that he didn't use the term ""faith"" in the sense that you were thinking. He meant faith in the sense of meaning 'trust.' For example everyone has trust in something. It's just a matter of where we all put that trust in. For atheists

*I don't think he really understood

&gt;Me: Thanks for getting back to me. I’m glad to hear you discussed it with your friends. I think interpreting his sermon that way is more reasonable

&gt;It sounds like what you are saying is that science and Christianity are in opposition to each other. Am I right? I mean, can I ask where you and your friends stand on the subject of science? 

*This is where it started to go off the rails. He's all over the place.* 

&gt;Him: I do know that atheists put all of their trust in science. But it's interesting that you say you don't believe that the world was created out of nothing which is what most creationists would believe. At least we can agree on that point. As far as the Big Bang theory, just a general statement) believe in karma. They go as far as to say that if they do something bad to someone, it will eventually come right back at them. If they do something good for someone, something good will happen in return. My argument is that if people can believe in a ""force"" why can't they just take it a step further and say that God is the one behind that? 

*I probably should have left it there

&gt;Me: Thanks. You say you’re not in total opposition to science

&gt;If you’d like an answer to your question “Why can’t people believe in God?”, but I think lifelong Christians (I don’t know, but maybe you fall into this category) can have difficulty understanding how anyone can not believe.

&gt;If you’re interested in understanding the REAL reasons, will find them very interesting.

*This is not what I was expecting

&gt;Me: Wow. I'll give this a good read. Thanks. 

*I got back to him a while later. I wanted to respond to what he posted without getting bogged down

&gt;Me: I think most of this is based on some simple misconceptions. 

&gt;1. Misconception - None of those writers have said religious people are dumb. They do say that certain religious IDEAS are bad. There’s an important difference. In fact

&gt;2. [Greg Koukl rejects science](http://ncse.com/rncse/17/5/newer-anti-evolutionists-introducing-greg-koukl). Ludicrous right? ;)


&gt;3. Misconception - Atheists are not moral relativists and the writers he is referring to specifically and repeatedly say so. He's either being dishonest

&gt;When the misconceptions are cleared up

&gt;Let me say too

*I thought it was a pretty reasonable and diplomatic way to respond

&gt;Him: 

&gt;1. As far as your idea that #1 is a misconception

&gt;2. As the title suggests

&gt;3. Here is where I think your argument has the biggest crack. How exactly do you measure morality? There has to be a standard to measure it by. Who says ""murder"" is wrong? Why is murder, and other crimes wrong if there is no God? It makes no sense. That was his point. If an atheist is not a moral relativist, then you are believing in absolutes right? How can you believe in absolutes if there is no God?

*He pulled out the thing I corrected him on in the beginning.* &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; *I really didn't know what to say.*

&gt;Me: ""He just doesn't believe that something comes from nothing as many atheists do."" 
Isn't this how we got started? :)

*Rhetorical question.*

&gt;Him: Nope. ;)

*Exasperated now.* 

&gt;Me: No?? Yes it is! I messaged you about the same allegation being in your Pastor's sermon! We're back to square one

*Just rolling my eyes.*

&gt;Him: I believe God created us. We came from something. That's all I'm saying. :)

*And this is where I gave up.*

&gt;Me: I know what you believe! :) If you read over my replies again

&gt;It just makes me sad when I hear people say atheists believe that everything came from nothing and that morals are relative. We don't. And we don't eat babies either! haha. 

&gt;Anyway, so how about we put it to bed? 

*But he still didn't get it.*

&gt;Him: You're also not understanding my point either. If atheists don't believe in moral relativism then where does the standard come from? It's Natural Law right? Where does Natural Law come from? Atheists have no idea and theists believe God established a moral standard which is how we got the 10 Commandments. Anyway you're right. We've reached an impasse but I enjoyed the discussion!

1349468382.0,110d0f,"In case anyone feels like sharpening their teeth on something, I'm in a debate with a friend and he just posted this refutation. It's a speech by Greg Koukl, who I'd never heard of. It's pretty bad.  ",bloody_hell,27,25, so if anyone wants to have a stab at anything here

&gt;Greg Koukl: The New Atheism: old arguments
This is a lecture that Greg Koukl delivered at the Apologetics Canada conference in March 2011.


&gt;Greg Koukl talks about the Four Horsemen of New Atheism: Richard Dawkins, and Christopher Hitchens. They believe that:

&gt;1) Believe in God and religion is irrational. Reason is on their side.

&gt;2) The discoveries of science have squeezed God out of the picture. Science is on their side.

&gt;3) Morality is on their side due to so many religious evil that has happened in the past. They say that if you're a fundamentalist you are dangerous.(However fundamentalist Christians would pray for you yet fundamentalist Muslims would kill you. Yet the media doesn't want to distinguish it that way.)


&gt;Rational challenges by new atheists fall into two categories:

&gt;1) Trashtalking- clever insults to intimidate the opposition. They have rhetorical impact but no substance. Even if Christians agreed with the trashtalking, God is a crutch but just because we have a need that's fulfilled by believing in God doesn't mean that God somehow disappears from the universe. You can turn it around and say that atheists have emotional needs by rejecting the existence of God. So? Does that mean Atheism is false? No it doesn't. You can't refute the evidence by talking about something else. You can't refute Jesus's existence by saying Christians are hypocrites....And yes there are Christians that use this poor argument and shame on them if they do.

&gt;2) Silly logic- Arguments in which the conclusions do address the issue but still fail to make their point. The logics are non sequitur. A) Christopher Hitchens said that if you look to nature as for evidence of Design how can 98% of all the animals species be extinct? He takes this as evidence of there not being a designer. So what is his point? If a thing was really designed, this isn't the fault of the Designer, it's just an acknowledgement that things change and that living thing goes extinct. The point here is that if something goes extinct has no bearing on whether it is or isn't designed as Christopher Hitchens suggests. That's silly logic. Extinction may tell you about changing circumstances but it tells you nothing about design. Hitchens in this particular objection has missed the point.  If God made the universe, who made God?This is the kind of question children would ask because they don't know any better. Richard Dawkins uses this as the backbone of his argument. He says that even a child knows to ask this question. Yes, the child will ask the question because the child doesn't realize the question is inappropriate. It's also known as ""Who designed the Designer?"" Yet an atheist doesn't believe God exists so they don't believe anything created God. A Christian believes God is eternal therefore he/she doesn't believe God was created. Neither person believes God was created so why would an atheist ask a Christian how God was created? There is nothing about the Theists case that requires him/her to answer who made God. The atheist might say ""Well you're asking who made the world?"" and they can respond with ""Who made God?"" This is a case of willful ignorance. When we ask who made the world, we all KNOW that the world was made. Everyone believes the world came into existence (Big Bang, Cosmology, you go to the beach and you see shoe prints in the sand and you say to your buddy that somebody was there before you. We weren't the first ones at the beach. Then your friend says ""OK

&gt;Cosmological Argument- The Big Bang needs a Big Banger. Every physical thing that began had to have something to begin it. The response from an atheist (especially Stephen Hawking) is that it's possible that the Earth came from nothing. OK, non-material, adequate to the effect, and something outside of historical time.

&gt;Is reason on the side of the atheist? No

&gt;Is Science on the side of the atheist?

&gt;Can you weigh a chicken with a tape measure? Because you can't does that mean the chicken has no weight? No. It just means you used the wrong thing to measure it by. Here is the first problem. Science is not capable of ruling out anything even in principle outside of the material realm. Using a tool that was meant to measure physical things is not going to tell you much about non-physical things. Certainly you can't disprove the existence of non-physical things such as gods, it's not physical, and if it's not physical, it doesn't need space to fit. It is possible to use physical material to infer the existence of a supernatural being. You can go the other way which is what the Big Bang Theory is. Something must have caused it to exist. Yet you can't put science before the Big Bang Theory because it has a limitation. Science has not said that God does not exist. It's just assumed. It's not that the scientific methodology was bad. It's just you came to the wrong conclusion. What's happening between science and religion now is based on a philosophical debate called materialism. If a theist tries to argue the point of when the universe came into existence, an atheist may say ""That's not science. That's religion."" They start labeling you as if to say your argument was poor. They think that if they can label it ""religion"" they can just dismiss the argument. A professor from Harvard said that ""our materialism is absolute.""

&gt;What about morality?

&gt;How can be there be a good God when there is so much evil in the world? In other for the objection to be raised, then there is no evil in the world. There are just different points of view on what people like and dislike. There is no real evil. If you are a relativist you can't help but submit to the objection if you are intellectually honest. Most atheists are relativists but they aren't consistent relativists. On one hand they want to argue relativism yet on the other hand they want to argue and complain about the problem of evil. Those things are inconsistent. For example one guy says he doesn't believe in God. You might ask ""Why not?"" He might say ""brussel sprouts."" You then ask ""brussel sprouts?"" He says ""Yeah they taste disgusting. God couldn't have made them."" You can't argue that because some people like them. But then he would say ""I can't believe in a God that would make something so distasteful to me."" It's a very shallow objection.

&gt;But let's say there is objective morality. Then the theist would ask what that is.If you say things are evil what do you mean? One might say ""You know, etc."" But you have just given examples of what is evil but you haven't said what actually makes those things evil. So what is evil? You might argue that it is when things aren't as they should be. Look at bowling. In order to determine how good you are at bowling, it requires a scoring system. If morality is objective then we have to have a scoring system as to tell us that rape and murder are evil. If objective morality requires a standard, then where did the standard come from? Where did the rule book come from? It has to be transcendent, not just based on opinions, and it can't be evolution because that will only give you relativistic morality because it's the best that it can do. The argument for evil is actually an argument that God DOES exist. This objection does not make sense in an atheistic world. It's the moral argument for the existence of God.

&gt;Chris Hitchens talks about religion being the greatest evil in the world. He says that more wars have been fought and most blood has been shed by religion. First of all it's a factual observation about history. More blood has been shed by religion. This is just plain false. More blood has not been shed by religion. The 20th Century was the bloodiest century in the history of the world and the 20th century alone conservatively estimates that over 100, Stalin, and Mao Zedong. What linked them together? A materialistic view of the world that God did not exist. Richard Dawkins argued that they didn't do it in the name of atheism but that's completely irrellevant because there's a natural connection between ideas and consequences and when people believe there is no moral authority over to whom they have to answer. Yes there are good atheists but is it required of them to be good? Absolutely not. If they have the power to do what they want they get the gulag and you get that kind of carnage at massive levels. There is also the argument that some religious people do evil therefore all religion is evil. Or some religions teach evil therefore all religions are evil. That doesn't follow. Or some religions teach evil and some religions do evil therefore God does not exist. That doesn't follow either. It's silly logic. How can you directly hold Jesus, the Bible, and God accountable because one person didn't follow what Jesus said in the first place? If they didn't follow Jesus instructions and they disobeyed what he said, how can Jesus be held responsible? Jesus is not responsible for those who go in his name but do the exact opposite of what he teaches.

It all started when I asked my step father why his one God was special when there are thousands of other Gods all throughout time that he doesn't believe in. He said he believed what he did because it was the way he was raised, Hindu. Greece in 1000BCE, Zeus and co. You get the idea.

What then happened blew my mind. Basically, considering when you accept Judaism unto yourself, you believe everyone else to be wrong, but they didn't see it that way. I asked them all when someone of the Hindu faith dies, who judges them, and they all answered with ""For them, the Hindu Gods.""

It made no sense to me. I talked about the nature of belief and how when you say you believe something

I basically set up a proof:

P1. By professing a belief in Judaism you accept Jewish law
P2. Jewish law states there is only one God.
C1. A Jew believes there is only one true God

P3. Any one who professes belief in another God is wrong.
P4. Hindus believe in multiple Gods
C2. Hindus are wrong.

They didn't see it like that.

I then said that the question of ""Does God Exist?"" has an answer. It is either yes or no

I then tried comparing it to baseball teams, and guy c. thinks it will be the Phillies.

Now, but two can't be right.

&gt; Well let me give you some facts: The Gospels are historically and textually accurate despite the original manuscripts having not survived the last 2

&gt; Source: http://www.irr.org/bible-reliable.html 

&gt; The Gospels are not the only source of historical evidence that Jesus existed let alone was crucified and performed ""miracles"". Cornelius Tacitus one of the most prominent first century Roman historians stated ""Christus, procurator of Judea in the reign of Tiberius: but the pernicuous superstition, repressed for a time broke out again, not only through Judea, where the 'mischief' originated, but through the city of Rome as well.""

&gt; Flavius Josephus, if it be lawful to call Him a man, for He was a dower of wonderful works, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to Him both many of the Jews and many of the Gentiles. He was the Christ, and when Pilate at the suggestion of the principal men among us, had condemned Him to the cross, those that loved Him at the first did not forsake Him; for He appeared to them alive again in the third day; as the divine prophets had foretod these and tenthousand other wonderful things concerning Him.

&gt; Other historians describing Jesus, Plinius secundus, Tertullian, Thallus, and Phlegon



&gt; There are easily four ways you can disprove Christianity:

1. If you can prove Jesus never was crucified
2. If you can explain the empty tomb
3. If you can explain there were post-resurrection appearances
4. If you can explain the existence of the Church itself



&gt; 1. The historians I mentioned all confirm the same information, and was crucified and died. A study done by William Edwards, MD; Wesley Gabel, MDiv; Floyd E Hosmer, MS titled ""On The Physical Death of Jesus Christ"" written in March of 1986 and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association states the impossibility that Jesus could have survived the flogging, dragging, physical abuse

&gt; 2. The tomb was found empty by two female followers. Women were considered to be invalid witnesses in court and in society and thus if a group were to make up a hoax, if the Jewish people were making a big deal out of it and causing a riot, then the authorities, either Roman or Jewish would investigate the ""correct"" tomb and prove to everyone that Jesus was indeed still dead in the tomb. If the disciples stole the body, then why would they have all died (except John) excruciating executions and deaths in the name of a lie and a hoax that they started? Next, how would the Christian church have survived and started in Jerusalem if Jesus was crucified there and it was known that the tomb was never empty?

&gt; 3. Jesus appeared to over 500 witnesses throughout Judea and the historians I commented on state the social movement and spiritual change in the people due to the appearances. It is historically factual to say that there was an aroused population AFTER Jesus died and that it was due to a shared experience: the appearance of Jesus. What needs to be explained is if this was a hallucination or a giant hoax that everyone agreed to.

&gt; 4. The Church itself shouldn't exist if Jesus never resurrected. Early Christians wouldn't have died under Nero and other tyrants if they had not had proof that Jesus was resurrected in the first place. The Church wouldn't have preached to Jerusalem-residents first




&gt; So I'll pose to you a likelihood. How more likely is it that all of these historians were misunderstood or misinterpreted their contemporary events than that God really does exist? Is it irrational to believe that there is something beyond the physical world? Something beyond just what the five senses can evaluate?",,t5_2ryfy,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/s02zx/need_help_breaking_down_argument/

In the historical/evidence section the following was stated:

&gt; Robert E. Van Voorst states that the idea of the non-historicity of the existence of Jesus has always been controversial, as well as biblical scholars now regard it as effectively refuted.[25] Walter P. Weaver, among others, states that the denial of Jesus’ existence has never convinced any large number of people, in or out of technical circles.[24][371][372]

But my question today is addressed to both, deeply, and answer it, I want everyone to be as honest with himself as much as possible, cause for every single unique person, it can say and mean a lot of different and unique things.

**Here it is :** 

***Whoever you are

* Here is my subjective

I was born muslim, they were good people, when i grew up, i started learning a lot of things from outside that i didn't like.

Recently, i've read a lot about atheism, and i finally decided to be honest to myself, i wanted to be honest with my parents too, I was ready for hell, but the answer of my father surprised me : ""you studied and really deepened your knowledge about atheism, and looked at it through your eyes only

I started studying about islam, I realized that what i was made to ""deduct"" from religion, wasn't really what I deduct and learn from it now.

I've been through a big circle, a walking meat of nothingness, in a corrupt cold world, and every single negative feeling about existence one could possibly have, I started not listening to myself, i forgot myself.

Suddenly, i realized that if there is a god, he trusts me, and when i looked deep, i found out that i REALY, REALY, REALY wanted god to exist, doors opened, and even if am the last to believe in a god in this world, and is true to myself more than ever

I know this will seem cheesy, lie, drama, brainwashing, fairy tale....... etc, and I don't really care, whenever I feel bad, only one :

(God created earth, i will create humans, they said to him ""Why would you create someone to ruin the earth, after you perfected it"", he answered, ""I know what you don't know"", he then created adam, because he created humans in a higher rank than every other creature, they all bowed, he will try to prove why humans aren't better than him

God is trusting me against Satan, lucifer, by my will alone, i thought to myself that even if this is real, then satan is winning, but looking deeply i realized that my mere existence, me, my mere insignificant will, then i'd least vanish feeling important

I can't not return his trust, even in my day dreams and imagination, I can't hurt or deceive anyone.

**TL;DR**: Whoever you are

**Edit**: First excuse my poor language, leave a comment, even if that comment is ""idiot"", or ""i want"", or ""i don't want"", but let me know what you think, i don't seek appreciation for my views, i want to know what are your stories, then it won't matter for me.

**Edit 2**: I don't remember asking for your judgment or appreciation to my views, if you want to write ""i don't care"", ""idiot"", ""i don't want"", feel free, but give me your opinion about your views, i don't want your opinion on mine.

Now I did consider posting it in [/r/debatereligion](/r/debatereligion) but I felt I was after it from a different point of view. 

The argument is of course:

1. If 'God' does not exist
2. Objective moral values and duties do exist.
3. Therefore

I don't want to get into discussing the syllogism itself merely the idea of objective moral values.

I cannot see how objective moral values can exist without an objectively moral judge. So if this judge do not exist then surly objective moral values do not exist and the argument is flawed.

Is this not circular logic? As first you have to prove that this ""judge"" exists before claiming objective morals exist.

In summary: How can this be used as an argument to support the existence of God when it relies on the existence of God to support the argument itself? 

If theists are not relying on the existence of God to support this argument

What I don't understand is how we an equate the natural (or artificial) selection of genetic traits (genes), or cats/lions etc.) and the creation of genes that actually fill roles in new systems of meaning.  I see examples of genetic diversity all around, and the more I understand of genetics the more I find we are able to explain almost every ""development"" as being the result of pre-existing flexibility of expression within the system.  In other words, I see almost unlimitted genetic change leading to merely different versions of the same genetic system rather than the development of different systems, with no mechanism for systemic change that can account for what we see today.  As a linguist the differences between the two types of change have obvious parallels in language, with the major difference being that biology is far more conservative and unforgiving of changes.

To this I'll add, in light of a complete absence of ""plateaus"", yet overwhelmingly we only seem to have these unchanging species.  to posit punctuated equilibrium only compounds the problem, as we are now suggesting even more mutations in a fraction of the time, mutations which we have almost no evidence for.  In fact the only thing I can see that could explain the fossil record yet still allow for evolution would be to assume that the entire record is the result of massive catastrophes that gave us snapshots of moments of history, rather than a gradual buildup of sediment.

1) Do you completely deny that there is any sort of ""greater power"" beyond what we currently understand? As in that maybe it isn't a deity but perhaps some other spiritual force that isn't a living being? Or would that even be considered a ""greater power"" at that point and just undiscovered/ explained science?
2) How do you usually respond to the question of ""where did the atoms that started the big-bang come from""? Is that question even relevant when it comes to discussing the existence of a deity?
3) Do you still feel ""spiritual"" despite not having a religion? As in you have a connection or oneness with the universe and life beyond just your emotions and the things you experience in everyday life? What is your explanation for those feelings/ lack of feelings?

More importantly, and so on.  Anything that would seem to have value would only have value because you assign value to it (so as long as you are pursuing what you value, you are right).  But I would go even further and say that value itself is meaningless.  There is no such thing as justice and injustice…things just are.

I think Sartre would say something to the effect that, as long as it fulfills you, personally.   Nietzsche, I think, would argue that what determines right or wrong in his morality is one’s power or will being forced on another.   I want to go even further and question why does fulfilling our desires matter?  Why do things that matter ought to be pursued?  And so on.

Now, than there is no objective morality, and thus no moral absolutes.

1. Gods word = the Bible. Just because you follow the Bible, things like slavery, murder, etc. would be permitted under special circumstance. Therefore, life would not be ""better"" for everyone if we all follow god's word.

2. God is not omni-benevolent if he sends his creations to Hell for not believing in him. If he is not all-loving, such as ego, vanity, and pride. Therefore, god can sin.

3. If god can hate elements of his creation, because he is an evil god, or b) is not capable of creating a perfect world. If he cannot create something as simple as perfect humans, then he might not be capable of even creating heaven/hell/the universe.

4. Free will allows for a Nobel Peace winner atheist to be condemned to Hell, then why do Christians need to uphold moral standards? If the whole purpose of life is to just believe in god and then go to heaven, we should indoctrinate all children and then kill them. There would be no need for life on earth at all.

***EDIT: Thanks very much for the feedback! I made a few tweaks as advised and have now sent it. Reddit will be the first to hear when I get a reply!***

http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/AP_06_pre.PDF

http://www.cpa.ca/cpasite/userfiles/Documents/advocacy/brief.pdf

In my opinion, the quality of and satisfaction with relationships within the family, and the level of co-operation and harmony between parents) that contribute to determining children’s well-being and ‘outcomes’, rather than family structures, per se, such as the gender, sexuality and co-habitation status of parents. Evidence which supports this conclusion:

http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/gill-v-office-of-personnel-management/2009-11-17-doma-aff-lamb.pdf

As further practical evidence supporting this, have in no discernible way been affected negatively by these marriages, in that they are very open, safe and peaceful societies, much more so than the UK or US (sources available on request!). I know, correlation does not necessarily imply causation; I'm not claiming that this is a direct result of the legalisation of gay marriage, merely that it's legalisation has had no discernible negative effect on society as a whole. With regard to the accusation that same-sex marriage has a negative impact on the concept of sustainable family, rates of opposite-sex marriage in those countries had gone up

http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2011/07/06/divorce-rates-lower-in-states-with-same-sex-marriage

Furthermore

Secondly, redefining marriage to prevent child marriage from occurring. Apologies for using an extreme example, but 100 years ago you could marry a child against her will and rape her once it was done, and that considered was legal and Christian marriage (legally, there was no such entity as marital rape). Even when looking beyond a legal perspective and considering the general definition of marriage, it is not resistant to change. Dictionaries, to use an quantifiable indication on the changing meaning of marriage as an entity, then

Thirdly, and such action would affect atheists and members of other religions than Christianity; therefore, opposition on a legal basis must be provided in purely secular terms, in the interests of the rights of those who are not Christian, since the law must treat them equally. The church can define Christian marriage in any way it pleases but there is no justification for this definition to be legally binding for the rest of the population. Marriage predates organised religion, it predates reliable recorded history, and exists today as a legal contract, whatever the additional implications theists may choose to associate with it. People are free to disagree with gay marriage but to use the government to prevent it is to violate the rights of homosexuals to exercise freedom of thought and association and have security of the person. This is favouritism of faith. This is essentially a case of values vs rights; it is acceptable for people to have different values about marriage in the UK or elsewhere, but to honour a commitment to the the legal principles of human rights which create an equal playing field for different sets of values to contest each other.

Jason Heath makes this point better than I can; see section 2 (pg 30) of the following article:

http://www.csps-efpc.gc.ca/pbp/pub/pdfs/P118_e.pdf

Fourthly, legalising same-sex marriage would not in any way affect the marriages of heterosexual couples. Bearing in mind my previously stated opinion that children do not suffer in any way whatsoever from being raised by parents in a same-sex relationship, I can't think of a single secular harm that gay marriage poses to people outside of gay couples. Legalising gay marriage does not in any way devalue or influence marriage for Christian couples or indeed any heterosexual couples; they are still bound by the exact same principles and concepts as before, they are just extended to include others. Meanwhile, those who are homosexual and cannot marry are subjected to considerable injustice by the current state of affairs. Singling out gay men and women as ineligible for marriage both stigmatises and invites public discrimination against them. Denying same-sex couples marriage represents discrimination based on sexual orientation; several American scientific bodies agree with this assertion. Source:

http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/gay-marriage.pdf

Fifthly, so even having the potential to reproduce is not a necessary requirement of marriage, and there is no reason why this should be the case, as it would imply that marriage must always be motivated by other factors than love.

To conclude; Marriage is about love and commitment. Heterosexual love is not superior to homosexual love and vice versa. Therefore, equality, tolerance and respect. What's wrong with giving lesbian and gay couples in loving, committed relationships the same rights and protections under the law as heterosexual couples?

The most compelling argument, they better have a damn good reason. ""My god says so,"" is not a reason until one can demonstrate that their god exists, that he disapproves of homosexual marriage, and that we have any reason to listen to that god. There is absolutely no compelling evidence that same-sex marriage is harmful to anyone, including children if the couple are parents, therefore the government has no grounds to limit this right for homosexuals.

I hope you've found this interesting and look forward to your response! :)

1328803731.0,phw4y,Morality,Slapmesillymusic,17,1,74,"I hear a lot of people (atheist/christian/muslim) saying that morality is something that you are born with. I don’t agree.  I say; morality is some thing that you are **born into** or join later in life. Here’s why;

I say that the concept of morality can be explained through behavioural sciences and that it has a psychological/sociological and even an evolutionary function. My definition is as follows.

*Morality is :*
What an individual in a group 
believes the group would find most favourable for that group in order to survive.

Take the notion of murder is wrong:

*I believe that the group I belong to considers murder of people within our group to be wrong. Therefore murder is wrong.*

Or on the other hand

*I believe that people close to me support murder of individuals within enemy groups. Therefore murder is **not** wrong* 


**Why do I think that my definition is the correct one?**

*Firstly*: because it gives an explanation that can be explained in terms of evolutionary advantages. That is

*Secondly* This definition explains why for example the Nazis find it morally correct to act in a way that others find immoral. 

*Thirdly* If we view morality as a individuals thought process (subjective for the individual) it can also explain why peoples morals can change. If individual changes ”group” the morality of that individual will change. Since it is the ”new” group’s values that are taken into consideration when deciding wither or not is morally correct. 


**Why is this important?**

Because in knowing what morality is you are able to question what the group believes. It is also easier to confront the discrepancy between what you believe the group to believe and what the group actually believes. It also allows you to se through the ”veil” of morality

But first and foremost it means that morallity isn’t a religious notion. It is a notion of psychology and sociology. That means it can be explained as to why it exist by showing the evolutionary advantages for an individual within a group that knows how to abstract itself within the group contra an individual that cant. 

To exaggerate: It gives us a better chance of survival if we don’t kill individuals in our group. It gives us a better chance of survival if we kill individuals of a rivaling group.  

This is how murder is immoral


**In short** I think morality can be evolutionary explained

Why are all these specifically because of religion? Please hear me out:

*""Religion is intolerant towards women - quote bible passage 1 Corinthians 10:3-10 etc"". 

If the social context of this bible passage is understood this passage is hugely liberal. In the time that Paul was writing to the Corinthians, tolerance) would have been considered demonic 2000 years ago. We can’t look back and judge what happened 2000 years ago with 21st century ethics. From an academic point of view this would be absurd, because we would be ignoring the political and social nuances of the time.

*”Religion promotes wars - look at the Crusades/911 etc”

At the time that the bible was written
My point here is that there has always been wars - before monotheism religions became mainstream

In a wandering sort of way, intolerant and violent if religion wasn’t mainstream. These are aspects of all society, not just religious society. I take my reference from the fact that looking around the world, everywhere you look is an example of intolerance, regardless of religion. My specific example here is France. France is a country that is 33% atheist, 34% belief in a god, 27% spiritual [ref](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_atheism). This is as intolerant as places that are 90% belief in a god (Cyprus) [i]from my own experience[/i].

EDIT having read some of the responses. I realise that the bible isn't wholly applicable today. It can't be - it was written for a far different society. The fact that some people DO believe that it was written as a guide to their lives today is a detriment to them. However. I reckon that if the bible wasn't there to guide these people, less bigoted, then religion will also become so. Look at the difference between the western world and the middle east. Western society is more tolerant, and so western religions are becoming more tolerant (slowly, granted, but changes are happening). Middle eastern society is as advanced as western society was ~500 years ago, and so it's religions and social beliefs reflect that.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/lvnii/if_not_for_religion_the_world_would_be_a_better/

For some people, but if it was God, what caused him?"" At first glance this seems like a valid question, but that's only if you look at God from the confines of our universe. Yes, in our universe everything must be caused by something else. However, if there is a God, he exists outside our universe

Okay then, each universe will take longer than the last. As this would go on forever, if you keep going back far enough it would eventually lead to a universe with zero length and no obvious past. This is something that doesn't make sense with infinity. 

The universe had to start somewhere. Whether our universe is the first or the billionth is irrelevant. I personally believe it's the first, there's no proof, so it's not like it proves one God over another, or even if it was God in the first place. That's something you would have to determine on your own. However it allows for the possibility of God being the cause of our universe. 

Some people believe that it's irrational to believe in a God if you can't prove it. I think that in itself is an irrational line of thought. If God exists

As my line of logic leads to requiring something to have caused the creation of this universe, I know science will never be able to answer it. Therefore, as this ""theory"" is the best theory I have found to answer this question, it's what I place my belief in.

One argument Craig brings against Harris that I found particularly convincing went at the heart of Sam's argument, if there is a possible world in which the rapist (who does what is evil even on Harris’ view) receives well-being, then there is a world in which well-being is not identical to good. In this case, then it is actually true (on pain of a violation of the law of identity) that the good is not identical to well-being in this actual world either. 

This can be argued around by disputing the ""any world"" interpretation of the law of identity (this may have a similar falling as the ontological argument: the non-necessary correlation between what's possible and what _is_) or by arguing against the fact that rapists, not away from.

Craig's arguments brought mostly nothing to the table. He defines god as the greatest possible being, of course, a meaningless tautology; if you define god as the greatest good, then yes, that's a very easy way of determining what's good. What he didn't do is provide a reason why that might be the case, a statement of [bare assertion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipse-dixitism). I've seen people claim that Sam went off topic near the end and just started attacking god but I think it was relavent to this point; he was attacking the assumed goodness of god's nature. Craig's arguments were nothing special, but he had some fairly good points about Harris' arguments which Sam did not address. This disappointed me, minimally

I hear many modern atheists saying it's time for us to tax churches (or synagogues, or crazy underground Scientology bunkers). I guess the feeling is that religious institutions are part of our society, and thus obliged to contribute to our society. Or maybe the feeling is that religious institutions are no different from other collections of people, like a business or a family. Why are churches so special?

And that was kind of my point of view as well, wouldn't the organization then suddenly have a voice in the political arena? They would want a say in how their money is spent, and they sure as hell wouldn't want their tax dollars supporting something they find morally objectionable.

I'm worried that if a religious group, Stone Age philosophy, we'd be even worse off than we are now. We'd see science and morality backtrack. We'd lose a lot of progress.

As I say, the more I'd rather see them excluded from paying taxes; far better to be gently coasting on top of others than to potentially actively participate in the regression of society.

On the other hand, and our minds (being in that universe) must not be rational either.  And then how can we trust them?  

It seems to be me that every time we do science we are assuming that nature is rational, not matter what field, no matter what it is, and it WORKS, it is validating those initial assumptions.  Science, every day, validates the hypothesis of a rational source to the universe.

1333382114.0,rpn4m,Religion in Politics - An easier religious comparison,Keroman,16,1,16,"I know that I'm not the first to come up with this sort of argument so hopefully I'm not making a fool out of myself in my first post on DebateAnAtheist.  I live in the Pacific Northwest which is generally a less religious area of the US so I haven't had a chance to run this argument by a real fundie yet

I've heard people argue against religion in politics by talking about the sort of things that would be made into law if any major sect of Islam came to power in the US.  I feel like an easier comparison for most people to swallow would be to ask what might happen if the Amish took over?  Despite their traditionally nonviolent ways you've got to admit that they hold some pretty extreme beliefs regarding technology which

If the Amish took over:

**No more modern medical care:** No abortions, ok so far so good for the average fundie.  How about no vaccines, no antibiotics, no inoculations, no viagra or hair-loss medication.  Invasive surgeries can't be done with monitoring equipment and more treatments will be invasive without the use of imaging electronics such as X-ray and MRIs.

**No electronics:** This brings to mind that picture of the lady holding the ""Computer = Homo Devil Machine"" sign.  Okay, your cars.  We've lived without that stuff in the past but they invariably make life more convenient for us now.  How about this?  No landline telephone.  The closest contact is no longer seconds away via 9-1-1 but minutes, even in a life-or-death situation where it can make all the difference.

**Self-Defense:** Say goodbye to guns.  If someone attacks you or tries to take something from you just back off and let them do it.  Retaliation or revenge is against the will of God or else why would the bad things happen to you in the first place?  If a loved one is raped they just have to suck it up and deal with it.


-----


These are just a few examples of what life might be like under Amish culture.  One immediate rebuttal might be that even if the Amish took over people would still be able to vote unfavorable politicians out of office.  Well what if they started changing the rules to vote as is common in many southern elections.  We've already ruled out electronic voting machines, you brought your own pencil but you bought it at the store?  Nope, gotta be a grease-pencil you manufactured yourself.  The ballot-box got stolen on the night of the election because the people responsible for it didn't resist?  Looks like you don't proper representation this year.

To me that's what it feels like as an atheist in the US dealing with fundies who want to push their religious ideologies on any and everyone no matter what they believe.  Like I said before it seems to me this comparison is easier to understand for many fundamentalist Christians because now we're talking about a sect of Christianity that's closer to home rather than Islam which generally causes fundies to lock down tight because of any mistaken beliefs they might already have about Islam

Others have simply stopped practicing any religion. This is extremely painful for me as a priest and as a Catholic. I would appreciate any thoughts why persons are leaving the Church and what would you suggest to bring them back home. PLEASE BE HONEST?""

I normally don't debate religion and theism on facebook
Prior to my response, etc. Finally, some good stuff started: 

**Bobbo:** 
&gt; Alot of reasons. Most deal with lack of credibility in doctrine and in the institution. The choice facing the Catholic Church is to modernize or continue to lose relevance. The time of talking snakes, in the age of reason, religion has to make sense. Christ's teachings are awe inspiring in their simplicity. In less then a hundred words, Christ challenges us to live a life humbled before God and dedicated to the service, love, and improvement of our fellow human. He expresses the enduring love of the Creator for the created. This message should be the focus of Catholic activities...not the rejection of medical insurance for responsible, often medically necessary

&gt;This topical issue is a perfect case study of what I am talking about. To allow the rhythm method but disallow chemical and barrier methods is illogical. Given the 100% efficacy of abstinence during fertile periods

&gt; I want to defend/embrace the Catholic Church and retain my ability to use reason and logic. The two are increasingly incompatible and the Catholic Church seems to never miss an oppertunity to force a choice between the two. Logic and science are the methodical seeking of truth

**Me:**
&gt;I'll preface this by say that, you asked for input, so I figured I could comment. 

&gt;Bobbo stated the largest problem quite well - the church is absolutely incompatible with reason. I am not denying that many doctrines, why use it at all?

&gt;At the very root of any faith, such nonsensical belief systems are valueless. 

&gt;The foundation of the church, it deserves no more place as a religious artifact than does any other cultural epic. 

&gt;\*\*\* From a reasoned perspective, and ignores (or even hinders) the advancements of science, is a stupid one. \*\*\*

&gt;Additionally

&gt;• The church is one of the richest organizations in the world. One on the pope's finger is worth more than most will earn in their lifetime. Similarly, all the while claiming to be a 'Charitable' organization. 

&gt;• Parishes world wide have provided cover ups and relocation for priests accused of child abuse. For an organization self-proclaimed as ""The Way

&gt;• Vatican authorities are currently under investigation for money laundering and child abuse cover ups. In the midst of these investigations

&gt;• The church and its leaders are willing to nitpick when defending beliefs regarding homosexuality and abortion

&gt;As mankind advances, no reasonable man needs heaven to be comforted. The authority figures in the church really don't serve a purpose anymore. In the past, the leaders served as educated representatives of the vatican / god, knowledgeable of the discussions that created catholic doctrine. Today, those discussion and dissemination of doctrines can be had instantly and include every single person on the planet. The time of a bureaucratic dogmatic patriarchy is past.

&gt;Mankind is growing, the church remains rooted in practices founded centuries ago. The flight from the church has only just begun - more and more people will become secular as the years go by. If the church stands any chance of ""bringing them back home"", it needs to completely change and challenge nearly every standpoint it currently holds. Barbaric traditions must be abandoned, and they must re-ground their foundations not in a book of myths, but in humanity. Jesus was a great philosopher (if he even existed), but a son of god? not within any stretch of reason. Sure, the beatitudes and commandments 4-10 offer rules standards for morality, any future church that will ""bring them back home"" will be a place of philosophic discussion and moral education

**Bobbo again:**
&gt;1984, just as unreasonable as to suppose His existence on blind faith. 

&gt;I am less concerned about the internal finances of the Church, the coverup by the leadership in the organization of sexual abuse. Although, at this point I believe the Church has incorporated mitigating factors, this situation has opened a Pandora's Box concerning the clergy's wisdom in matters of sexuality. I know nothing of the money laundering situation facing the Church, however obviously would not condone such activities if they are in place.

&gt;As for homosexuality and abortion. I see nothing wrong with a religion voicing its views on social matters. As a living being, matter and energy combined with purpose and agency appears thus far to be extremely rare. It should be valued, treasured. Science without ethics and morals is a dangerous thing. All manner of very dark things can be rationalized. The challenge to lead a better life and seek out self improvement, which any religion of value poses to congregants, pays dividends to society as a whole. To be against the idea of religion I think is to reject a facet of life from which great joy and peace can be achieved. To do so without empirically disproving the existence of a Divinity is to potentially cut yourself off from your purpose of being. In my mind, the athiest is just as irrational as those who blindly adhere to faith and tradition. To presume we are close to having this whole universe/existence thing figured seems a premature. With the data still coming in and much left unexplored, to conclude there is no God

&gt;Man kind is growing, now serves to power my XBox and illuminate my house. Imagine where we will be in another thousand years. Sons and daughters of God seems to be an ever more apt label for humanity. But in order to properly own that label, we need to wrestle with the ideas of right and wrong. The consequences of doing so couldn't be higher, and as a framework for engaging in this struggle religion has social value. 

&gt;As a baptized Catholic, but to the institution as a whole. I want others to benefit as I have from the truths found in the Church's teachings. As it is a man made organization, filled with and administered by human beings, it is imperfect and needs to seek out its own imperfections and improve them. It has to be a living religion to be relevant. You can't be in the market of selling truth without ensuring quality control. This is anathema to some. Anytime doctrine is questioned, words like heretic are bandied about. This isn't unique to religion. Any culture feeling threatened by those who would pose questions can react poorly. The last words of Socrates provides a perfect case study. But the reality of the situation is, heretics of the time are often proved right when the jury of history makes its ruling. Martin Luther was alot more right then he was wrong, but at the time, get people talking about what we believe in the light of day versus in incensed shadows. Let us examine our faith and see if what we profess makes sense. Let us hold our leaders accountable when they fail us. The more we do this

&gt;And one final thing

**Me:**
&gt;Bobbo, you would ask for evidence. But if I claimed that I cannot fly, you would not ask for evidence. Such defense for god is making use of a logical fallacy known as ""argumentum ad ignorantiam"". When talking specifically about god, I again will cite Russell's Teapot as an exemplary explanation here. 
(I would also add: though it is, it is very possible to prove his lack of influence in the universe. See Laurence Krauss's ""A Universe From Nothing"".) 

&gt;You next points were more about religion as an institution rather than god specifically. I completely agree that religion institutions should voice their opinions on social matters. As philosophical educators, and condemning their opposition are two different actions entirely. In the case of the catholic church, the rarely only voice opinions. As their history exemplifies, they are willing to kill millions in defense of their beliefs.

&gt;You also suggested that condemning religion entirely is rejecting part of life that brings joy and beauty. Again, etc. are invaluable parts of human history. But, just as you reject the beliefs of Roman Mythology, you still appreciate the beauty of the Pantheon and the imagery of the Odyssey. Taking this more modern, I recognize JK Rowling's fantasy world has great stories and even morality at its core, but you won't find me building a wand any time soon. I don't reject the beauty of religion, especially of the bible - it's contains some of the best epics ever written. There is a difference between rejecting it's preaching and authority
You failed to recognize that though religion is a source of beauty and peace, endorsements of slavery, payment for confessions, bought papacies, approval of Nazi germany, etc. Such flagrant and wide spread evils can only be accomplished under the guise of ""for god"". 

&gt;You also, you see another purpose in life. Again, this is another argument where the burden of proof lies with you. 

&gt;I again agree with you in your next point - that religion needs to adapt / change to maintain relevance. To this point, when discussions about morality and philosophy happens globally and instantly, why do we still need religion? Religion just disconnects morality with its roots - instead of ""for the sake of humanity"" it becomes ""for the sake of god / heaven"". Worse though, religion brings with it flaws, and illogic: ""believing something without reason"". Utter nonsense that leads to further nonsense. 

&gt;Lastly, simplest pieces of moral direction even created. But, believing in him as a brilliant carpenter, versus as the son of god, are not the same. But, unlike what you claimed, christianity is more than believing just the philosophy of one man - it's believing the myths of lazarus, and the resurrection. My respect for Jesus's preaching does not make me christian any more than my respect for Buddha's make me buddhist. If religion were merely a philosophy

That's pretty much it. There are also the qualities of immortality and divinity, although, in the same vein, I would expect that, considering the size of the universe, there are very likely many beings with preternatural powers. The supernatural is a trickier beast, but I would argue that the nature of the limits of the natural is beyond our current understanding, which would make the supernatural meaningless.

There is a possibility that all of the gods defined today are simply culture-specific metaphors that I don't understand, a lot of religious people seem happier than me which makes me think they could be onto something.

There are many religions, The Greek Gods, since there are so many interpretations

However, there are theories that are made by many scientist. These theories (the most popular ones) seem to hold the same basic tenets, except with nuances on certain areas. Since none can be disproved or proved, we simply speculate on how practical and feasible that theory is. If it works well, then we give thought/experiment to it. However, we never shoot down any other theories; there could be another interpretation of an event out there that may be equally as possible and have its own merits. But just because we dont know what is happening, we do not dismiss the basic concepts within these theories.

Why are we not applying the same standard to religion? There are countless interpretations of God; as part of a trinity or Yahweh or Allah. They all have the same basic moral values and beliefs (monotheism, like Ramadan and Yom Kippur both involve fasting). They are all **theories** on the existence and nature of God/humans/the world. These theories cannot be proved, because there will always be an answer provided by these religions (i.e. we cannot simply say ""If God exists, then he will prove it by making it rain for 3 seconds!"".). So they will always remain theories about religion.

But then why do many Atheists press the notion that because there are many interpretations

TL;DR The many religions in the world should be treated as theories (in science) about religion. They should not face the argument that a conflict with explanation automatically means all explanations are false. Just as many theories rise up but only one can be true

**NOTE: Please

This thread is to discuss the specific issue of the argument that many religions means no true religion. NOTHING ELSE PLEASE.

1372730485.0,1hgw3g,The Secular Argument Against Abortion,crdto,33,18,296,"[What I said originally; if you have objections to it


It's outlined pretty well [here](https://sites.google.com/site/roeflip/).

To make the argument in one sentence: The fetus deserves the fundamental right to life that we attribute to all human beings

A key distinction must be made between 'human being' and 'person.' I will concede that the fetus is not entirely and unequivocally a person. I think a decent argument could be made that it is, in that it is a living member of the species Homo sapiens. Given this, it deserves at least some rights; at the very least it deserves the right to life.

This argument is only for the standard

I'm interested to see what other atheists have to say about this. I'd like to hear arguments that don't rely on religion for a change.

EDIT: It's become clear to me that I have not thought out why human beings deserve the right to life. Any input on this is very much welcome

---

EDIT#2: 

Alright, is not well-formed. I do not think it is because the argument itself is bad, although I concede my definition of human being was problematic; rather, I think I did not explain or understand it well enough. I'm going to try it another way, with a slight modification on my definition of 'human being.' The following are two sort of interrelated arguments. The first addresses the fetus's right to life; the second addresses the 'implied contract' a woman accepts when she engages in sex.

1. Society has determined that the intentional killing of human beings with some of the characteristics of personhood and/or the capacity for the characteristics of personhood is wrong^A except when another's life is in danger
2. A human being is a member of the species Homo sapiens that exhibits brain activity^B
3. The fetus is a member of the species Homo sapiens that exhibits brain activity^C
4. The fetus is a human being
5. The fetus exhibits some characteristics of personhood, motivation, emotion, and awareness^D
6. The fetus has the capacity for all characteristics of personhood
7. The fetus is a human being with some characteristics of personhood and the capacity for all characteristics of personhood
8. The killing of a fetus is wrong by the standards of society except in cases where the woman's life is threatened^E

A: Take, but I think everyone would agree that killing it would be wrong, no?

B: Admittedly, that this is the best definition. I can't come up with anything less ambiguous that doesn't include things like stem cells, dandruff, tumors, etc. Thoughts?

C: [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo#cite_note-6)

D: I can provide sources for these if you really want (Although it's sorta propaganda, is not to focus on these specific ones I mentioned. There is no consensus on the definition for personhood, but with any definition put forth, the fetus will display basic elements of at least one characteristic. This held up for every *decent* definition I could find. Some definitions were as simple as ""has memories,"" which is clearly an insufficient definition of a person.

E: One objection that this set does not address is the argument that the fetus is a 'parasite' that is feeding on the woman, but the basic idea is evident. I'll probably edit it for clarity eventually.

1. Consensual sex carries an implied risk of pregnancy^F
2. A woman understands that when she engages in sex
3. Pregnancy involves the use of the woman's body by the fetus
4. A woman understands that when she engages in sex
5. By engaging in sex
6. The fact that the fetus is a 'parasite' is not a justification for abortion because the possibility that the fetus will use her body is accepted by the woman when she engages in sex^GH

F: Consensual is a key word here

G: Because I don't think this is linked very well with the previous argument

H: Because most people seemed to be arguing against the idea that the fetus deserves the right to life rather than the idea that the fetus's right to life is greater than the woman's right to her own body, most new replies are going to focus on this one.

If I look at a wall and it appears blue, as the light took time to reach me. We can then say that science cannot prove that humans evolved from simpler organisms, as we didn't directly observe it when it happened. This can also be expanded to big bang theory/ virtually-every-other-scientific-theory: if we were not there to observe it, then how can we be certain that it happened? 

Another point was that science is fundamental flawed, then their idea is proved completely wrong. Furthermore, it's currently a scientific law that heat flows from hot objects to cold objects. But, one day if heat is observed flowing from cold to hot, then the entire law must be wrong!

1364404874.0,1b4cmq,"Reformed Theology - Atheist world view can account for logic, math, morality, induction or proofs.",kycor,9

I have a family member who recently turned to Refromation theology from supposedly an atheist worldview prior. He's attending a school to study his faith and has been doing a great amount of research in epistemological philosophy, etc. He asserts that though atheists can use logic, an atheist worldview can't account for logic, math, morality, induction or proofs. He claims that proving something doesn't actually prove anything (a very abstract idea) and that we can't just presuppose things. He is thoroughly convinced that atheism has no solid intellectual ground to stand on. 

I completely disagree, if logic and how we attain knowledge can't be known for sure to identify truth then everyone bases things either on ""faith"" or by their own best guess from probability. He states that the atheists actually borrows from the christian world view and that they will continue to until they have an answer for how ""universal abstract invariants"" can exist in their own.  I fail to see how atheists use just a christian world view to use laws of logic, math, science and morality. 

I think atheists (at least I do) base their world view on what can attribute to a clear and probable understanding in search for real truth. Maybe this sometimes pulls from society for morality, and logic? How the hell does that have anything to do with a christian worldview? I don't see how the Reformed theologies use math, science and logic to infer there's a man in heaven watching our every move to judge your immortal soul when you die (how do you even get to there being a soul in the first place?) and that the bible is for a large part literal and historically correct.

First of all I would like to say I am new here

My question to all of you is this:  When we as human beings observe some lesser life form such as a plant, feel, touch, or smell anything.  However, this plant is still alive.  If you put a bee into a glass jar with the bottom of the jar open, the bee will run into the side of the jar over and over again until it dies.  It won't figure out how to escape.  Your dog at home doesn't seem to be able to tell if you have been gone for 5 minutes or 5 days.  So, all of these life forms are completely unable to even observe a part of reality that to us is very plain and simple.  We often think of ourselves as the epitome of creation, only because we have yet to come across a life form which is ""greater"" than us.  

Isn't it very possible that there is much, but in reality, we don't know anything at all. Even current models of the universe as we understand it now project there to be many more dimensions than we can observe.

That point being made, it is not unreasonable to think that it didn't happen by accident?  To say for sure that there is no God, to me, seems arrogant because it makes the assumption that we could be able to answer that question in the first place, let alone to have one person figure out the greatest questions man has ever asked. (Why are we here? Where did we come from?  Is there meaning to all of this?)  While any ""theistic"" view at least aknowledges the fact that we are NOT able to know or observe all there is to be, and there is a much greater reality than ours.

How do you

I know someone is going to say this is an argument from ignorance, god isn't real and reality is some sort of fluke or entirely explainable and understandable existence. That is not a solid argument to me.

Now, do believe in G-d (though not necessarily the Biblical one), attended Catholic school for four years, attended Sunday/Hebrew school until I was Bar Mitzvah'd at age 13, and have continued to study theology (mainly in a political/social context), and consider myself to be pretty much a social liberal.

That said, I DO have an issue with extremism, narrow-mindedness, and pushing your beliefs (or, in this case, lack of beliefs) onto others.

But that's just what I feel a lot of online atheism strives to do.  I think we can all agree, moral values, expression of self, etc.).  Unfortunately, these extremists are often the most public figures when atheists make a stance for the evils or naivety of religion.

The point that I'm trying to make here, in large part, atheists are the ones who are helping to perpetuate this view of religious people as out-dated zealots.  This is because atheists, like religious extremists, can be overly vocal in their preachings.  I've been astonished by how many times atheists have made insensitive remarks about how dumb or pointless religion is while at the same time they present themselves as ignorant and arrogant.

Like many of you I'm sure growing up into religious households, I've had my doubts about my denomination and faith in general. (Something growing into a more radical denomination hasn't helped with.)

But I fully plan to serve the mission. I understand my family and friend's belief, let alone the Mormon view of him, 2 years is an insignificant sacrifice. I'm mostly going though for myself. Even from a secular standpoint, being able to spend 2 years of my life on a veritable adventure sounds like a fair investment. On a mission you are intended to be 'immersed in the gospel', **I figure my mission to be the best time to legitimately look into my faith and decide for myself.** I'm just curious if anyone from the more atheistic persuasion find any inherent problem with this approach. Is 'brainwashing' inevitable if I so simply leave on it(something I can't imagine you to be able to support anymore than them declaring a god in general.). But, more generally, **is this a flawed approach of looking into my faith?**  *Now to the real question.*

I see all too many posts where more atheistic people fervently declare any sense of illusion beyond enjoying a piece of art to be some inherent injustice if not downright inhumane to not prevent. Some I see take it to a near evangelical extreme. I understand many have found themselves to be far more happier, I can accept a certain level of illusion as even healthy. The more I look into it the more **I find myself leaning towards a centralist agnostic and even Buddhist outlook on the whole topic.** I'm just trying to get a litmus test for how many atheistic people are legitimately 'okay' with other's illusions.

Now I already know you're not all diehard evangelicals, apathy goes down to for many. How many atheists could legitimately care less? **How many could even accept the basis of what they consider others illusions as non-harmful and even healthy.** (Something I understand might exist in many, but not under the scope of Abrahamic religion.)

Well, but two of them seem to conflict. As far as I can see, there's as little hard evidence for morality as there is for God. (This is probably why so many theists distrust atheists.) But, of course, most (or at least very many) atheists do believe in morality/human rights/etc. If I haven't gotten any of my premises wrong, why isn't this a contradiction?",,,,

Some counterpoints just on the top of my head.

1. There are many quotations in books such as the bible that unequivocally supports hate

2. The basic tenets of for example Christianity, subjugation to god, original sin, are in an of themselves ideas that lead to problems. If the punishment God sees fit for sinners is eternal burning, how can that be reconciled in the religious mind with tolerance and secularism? Also by believing in god you inevitably give up part of your critical thinking (you believe something without proof), with can facilitate other evils.

1325819415.0,o4wbr,I humbly seek answers to your POV.,BulletCatcher,20,6,133,"Original Post:
TLDR; I believe in God and say science is the way he works.  People choose what they want since God gave us free will. Organized religion is highly suspect. God is the goodness that we as people exhibit to one another. God is everything. Science proves the existence by showing us how everything works. 
Humans

I call myself Christian. I believe in God. I believe that Jesus died for me. I feel some people's POV is that God is a grey bearded wizard raising the dead, only science. 

I see God in everything. I believe science proves God's existence every day. Not ""God makes the sun rise, I say, science explains how these things happen. Ok, I agree, I see the facts. If I say God is there doing that. Am I crazy? I don't run around preaching to people rather I say people should do what they choose to. 

God gave us free will. We are able to do what we want with it

Some religious people deserve it because religion has been used throughout history to oppress, murder, and steal, yadda, yadda, yadda. I think someone said ""God I love you, but I do not love your Christians.""

I have no faith in humans as a species since we eat our own. America is full of corruption at the top levels of government and big business is right there. The goodness that we put out to one another and living a good life is all that is needed to have a good afterlife not submitting to some religious organization that has been corrupted ever since human hands have gotten on it. 

To wrap up my wall of text




Edit:
What am I? What label do I fit under? To answer my initial question after a lot of helpful responses. Critique me more please. 

I see myself more as a person who believes a God did create the universe and our understanding of science and the processes that make things work were designed by God. At one point in history God was involved in the lives of humans. Jesus comes and goes. Some point God leaves us to our own devices. And here we are today. 

I can't accept the bible as 100% true but also know there is truth in the bible

God is not the answer to the unknowns in life. I believe we humans could use more humility as a species

I have faith in a God but do not let that make retarded decisions like some farm animal(specifically politics and my view of other's personal choices). I am a sensible person that believes and accepts reason and logic when it is there but also accepts.

You were very helpful. But one response did trouble me: /u/MrSenorSan said ""Evolution has nothing to do with atheism

What all atheists share is the belief that all beliefs should begin with the null hypothesis. This null hypothesis can only be refuted with evidence (and evidence must be verifiable, and empirical). This is word-for-word what science holds - ""the null hypothesis is true until there is evidence to the contrary."" 

If the two thought groups - atheism and science - begin from the exact same starting point - ""You must show evidence that disproves the null hypothesis"" - then how are they really different at all? How is science different from atheism if they both begin from the exact same starting point? On this thought train, wouldn't a blow to science, e.g. evolution being hypothetically disproved, be a blow to atheism?

&gt;""First off

&gt;Let me give you a little background information on what my church believes. I think it might help you to understand their standpoint a little better. We believe that before this Earth we lived with God as Spirits in Heaven. He wanted us to become like Him, to pay the price for every person's sins.
Every person is given trials, He gives us trials that He knows will help us grow and develop us into better people and more like Him. We also believe that we aren't given any kind of temptation that we can't handle. (1 Corinthians 10:13)

&gt;The church's standpoint on homosexuality is that it is one of those temptations that God gives us. The church isn't denying that those feelings aren't there for people or are in any way fake. What they're saying is just because you feel those feelings doesn't mean you should act on them. Let me give you an example. If someone is born with a short fuse, but it doesn't mean those should be acted on. This of course stems from the belief that we believe that marriage is a sacred unit ordained of God and should only be between man and women.

&gt;You're probably thinking, know people that are homosexuals and feel bad for the various judgments placed upon them. It's especially hard to be a religious person and to have same-sex attraction. Why do some people have to have the trial of homosexuality? It seems like one of the hardest things that someone would have to deal with in this life! But I eventually learned what's not fair is to discredit the hard things that other people have to endure. We all have our struggles- nobody can avoid them. But what right do I have to declare that my trials are harder than someone else's? Life is full of struggles that might seem unfair. Homosexuality just happens to be a challenge that society focuses on and is politicized. I think that the sad thing in that is that a lot of society is for accepting homosexual behavior and yet they define homosexuals by their sexuality. There is so much more to a person than that!

&gt;I think the purpose of the website is help people to be more understanding of the challenges that individuals face. God told us to love one another. We can do that without being supportive of the life choices that some people make.

**Chapter 6 - Science Has Disproved Christianity**

&gt;Dawkins said very famously that ""although atheism might have been logically tenable before Darwin

&gt;the scientist must always assume there is a natural cause.  That is because natural causes are the only kind its methodology can address.  It is another thing to insist that science has proven there can't be any other kind... [that however] is a philophophical presupposition and not a scientific finding.

&gt;The other hidden premise is this statement ""miracles cannot happen"" is ""there can't be a God who does miracles.""  If there is a Creator God

This chapter started out very frustrating.  He quickly extrapolates science to an extreme position it is not taking by playing word games

&gt;To be sure that miracles do not occur you would have to be sure beyond a doubt that God didn't exist

Keller doesn't understand skepticism.   It gets worse though.

&gt;Evolutionary science assumes that more complex life-forms evolved from less complex forms through a process of natural selection.

*sigh*... I can't tell if Keller is deliberately dishonest with his diction or if he really is that ignorant on scientific subjects. 

&gt;When evolution is turned into an All-encompassing Theory explaining absolutely everything we believe, then we are not in the arena of science, but of philosophy.

So what exactly are you trying to argue Keller? 

&gt;Ian Barbour lays out four different ways that science and religion may be related to each other: conflict, and independence.

[Wikipedia link explaining the different relationships](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship_between_religion_and_science)

&gt;The conflict model gets... the most publicity.  [however] Smith argues that the conflict model of the relationship of sceince to religion was a deliberate exaggeration used by both scientists and educational leaders at the end of the nineteenth century to undermine the church's control of their institutions and increase their own cultural power.

Right...

&gt;Dawkins cites this statistic [7% of National Academy of Science believe in a personal god] as evidence that intelligent scientific thinking almost always leads to the conclusion that God does not exist.

&gt;To hold that a transcendent God created the universe is not enough to be listed as a 'believer'.

In a personal god.  Stop playing word games please.   Anyway what is your point? 

&gt;Sociologists of knowledge like Peter Berger have shown that our peer group and primary realtionships share our beliefs much more that we want to admit.

Ohhhh

&gt;philospher Thomas Nagel... thinks Dwakins is wrong to insist that, string theory, or whatever purely extensional laws govern the elements of which the material world is composed."" He asks, for example, whether we really believe that our moral intuitions, such as that genocide is morally wrong, are not real but only the result of neurochemistry hardwired into us.  Can physical science do full justice to reality as human beings experience it? Nagel doubts that.

So.. let me recap.  Your counter argument to an evolutionary biologist (Richard Dawkins) and neuroscientist (Sam Harris) on the subject of evolutionary biology and neuroscience come from a philosopher? Right... and the counter argument is 'misrepresent science' followed by 'Nagel doubts that'.   Actually lets let Keller sum up his argument thus far.

&gt;science cannot explaing everything

This chapter stopped being frustrating and started to become hilarious

&gt;Christians who accept the Bibile's authority agree that the primary goal of Biblical interpretation is to discover the Bibilical author's original meaning... Psalms [Christians] read as poetry.  When they read Luke

Good thing Luke doesn't have any historical mistakes.   But thats not what this chapter is about.

&gt;I think Genesis 1 is poetry... Genesis 2 is an account of how it happened.

Wait what?  So you just spent the entire chapter showing how science and religion are not in conflict only to admit on the last two pages that you are a creationist? 

&gt;Only after drawing conclusions about the person of Christ... should one think through the various options with regard to creation and evolution.

Exactly

&gt;I'm sure that many reading this will be irritated that I don't take time here to adjudicate between the competing views.  For the record I think God guided some kind of process of natural selction

Well thats a realy wide range of possibilities. 

&gt;One commentator on Genesis captures this balance well:

Sometimes Catholics don't understand faith. Being an agnostic-agnostic with some understanding of theology

Faith doesn't need proof, for faith is over any argument, faith is an agreement that's not negotiable. One could argue you don't need to be ignorant to have faith, and that knowledge does not dispel faith, will does.

So why is it that most Atheist arguments are always logical constructs

Most religions aren't in an open market of whom has the most convincing arguments or who has the most compelling evidence. Religions are based on faith

So my point is I think if a person is already open to debate the substance of her beliefs then she already turned away from religion

I as an agnostic atheistist find myself convincing people of either truly believe in what they preach or leave the belief completely in equal amounts as I find no relevance in discussing e.g. the historical existence of Jesus

I'm not terribly familiar with Feser, sorry for the length:

 I realize that some concepts are difficult, while the basic structure of the main versions of the argument is fairly simple, the background metaphysics necessary to a proper understanding of the key terms and inferences is not.  It needs some spelling out, which is why Aquinas and The Last Superstition each devote a long chapter to general metaphysics before addressing the question of God’s existence."" Now, you may take that as merely an advertisement for his books, but there are many other works (very in depth ones as well) that I could recommend and that Feser would recommend as well (just look at his recommended blogs and resource list on his sidebar). Regarding the notion that ""God's essence is his existence,"" while we may not fully grasp it, or that in virtue of which something is, to more fully understand this and its implications

Regarding the post I linked about the cosmological argument, but that too can properly be done only after the background ideas have been set out.  And that too is a task carried out in the books. I will deal here with some of the non-serious objections, though.  In particular, what follows is intended to clear away some of the intellectual rubbish that prevents many people from giving the argument a fair hearing.""

Feser actually responded to Rosenhouse in both combox comments and a couple of blog posts. If you're interested

Finally, we know the claim of the cosmological argument is refuted..."" you mean if we were to find something that began to exist that didn't have a cause. Of course, if we were to find such a thing science would grind to a halt since science is essentially a search for causes. But even IF we found something that began to exist with no natural explanation, that would not affect Aquinas' arguments I don't believe. That thing's essence and existence would still be distinct since it began to exist. Its essence and existence would still need to be ""joined"" together so to speak. And it obviously wouldn't exist by nature since it began to exist, and the arguments from Aquinas demonstrate what a being who's essence and existence are identical entails. 

Now, assuming here you mean something beginning to exist without a cause, or from nothing. Why do you think that's what quantum mechanics shows? I disagree with that conclusion, but I want to here your take on it as someone who studies physics.

You say that saying there is a difference between the premises ""everything has a cause"" and ""everything that begins to exist has a cause"" is ""ridiculous"" and ""hair-splitting word games."" But this is certainly not the case. The two premises relate two entirely different concepts with two entirely different meanings. I'm not sure why you would think this is simply a word game. As any good philosopher, one must be accurate in what they are stating and studying. ""Everything has a cause"" and ""X has a cause"" are not remotely the same thing.

At around 3:20 I woke up and saw that my brother and sister were sound asleep, so i figured I would go to the couch and sleep there. I laid down on my stomach with my face facing the back rest of the couch and my left arm was dangling down from the couch.

My brother and sister where in the exact same spots 5 ft away from me. I remember saying ""alright alright I'm going back down to the floor"" cause I was freaked out..

- Why does religion still exist today? A lot of really complicated reasons. Probably outside of the scope of a little facebook post like this. But it is on the decline (source). I don't think humanity will ever be completely free of religion and superstition; we just aren't that great at critical thinking. We're too easy to trick.

- How do intelligent

-  Personal experience is a really really terrible, so outside observers can vet it. Every step of the scientific method, from the hypothesis you form, to the way you analyze the data has to be open to scrutiny.

- This is probably the most contentions point I will try to make: True religion (faith) and true science are fundamentally in conflict. What can be discovered through skeptical inquiry and rigorous scrutiny requires no faith to believe; claims which require faith are by definition outside the scope of true scientific thought.

I suppose I will learn many more insights into how other people think and so plan to refine this argument based on what I learn from everyone.  Thanks in advance for your thoughtful replies.  


I don’t understand why atheists think faith in God is irrational.  I think it’s quite rational and I will try to explain.  Please note

If we consider the universe that we live in,  we don’t know, and it’s not logical to make up some God.  I disagree.  If it turns out that it is more likely that the universe did have a beginning, then we arrive at a dilemma.  

Our natural world teaches us that, then we could say that the universe was caused. And if there were a time that the universe did not exist, we have an interesting time trying to think about how something was caused when nothing existed.  The fact is, our current understanding of the universe does lead us to believe that it did, indeed, have a beginning; that there was a time when it wasn’t.   Is this a fact?   Well, it is a strongly established theory with empirical evidence to support it;  So

So the next question must concern this “unknown cause”.   We could defer

Why is this a rational  route?  Because this conclusion is not reached by fanciful thinking.  We are actually pushed into this corner due to the nature of the dilemma; which I will remind you is as follows: the universe exists while evidence suggests that

I always hear atheists say there is no evidence for God and that faith is irrational.  To continue making an appeal for evidence (when it’s the evidence of the universe that leads us into a series of questions that allows us to infer a God) is not convincing

All of the above does not prove God.  But it provides a rational basis for faith.  As a side note, places this ‘cause’ outside of nature.  Science can’t find God.  He’s not where they are looking.  Also, being outside of nature,  beyond our natural realm, existing before time even began, where time did not exist, logically leads to the break down of cause and effect, resulting in infinite regression.  

Edit:  Sorry

I also notice that the tone of some of the responses seems to ask me for proof for God.  I stated from the beginning that I am not attempting to prove anything but ""one"" reason for faith; I see a big difference between proof in God and reason for faith. I will have to address this in the future.  

I also notice a lot of focus on secondary questions, but is it sentient, etc? These are valid questions that have other answers. In my opinion, my argument doesn't answer such questions.   My intent was to focus on the riddle of how the universe can exist if at one time, it didn't...proposing that an appeal to an unknown realm (call it the supernatural or beyond nature) is a sufficient inference.  Though there are many thought provoking replies here, I feel a lot of what some people have written applies to future questions and so does not address the issue.  This, in my opinion, logical question. I guess that's the problem...an appeal to such realm necessarily involves such questions.  Other reasons for faith answer some of these secondary questions.  It just gets too cumbersome to include all answers in one post.  That's what books are for. 

**Edit 2:**  Another theme I notice popping up is the concept of time.  I am quite aware of the idea that before the big bang, our language presents a problem when discussing this topic.  I thought this was understood and did not mention it in my OP.

Is a belief in god and the culture that grows around that belief a net negative to society?  Sure, sense of community and purpose that stems from religion?  Do those not outweigh the negative?  I don't know.  

As a Christian, they remove the need for God.  They tell people that adhering to a religious doctrine is more important than the inner speaking of God.  Religion is man made, and according to the Bible, will ultimately be destroyed (religious Babylon).  I've heard this many times but it bears repeating (even if my audience is atheists and anti-theists):  Religion is something done for God without Christ.  It is vanity, worthless in the eternal sense.  But does it do more good than harm to society as an institution?

We cannot even discuss or interpret the will of said god

(2) ""If we can understand the essence of god

Assuming for the sake of argument that (2) is true. However

Or it holds that logical inconsistencies and contradictions are correct conclusions of arguements about the essence of god. Since an inconsistent and contradictory being cannot be real

**Constants**: There are several physical constants that must *all* fall within a very narrow range for life *in any form* to exist. Many of these are independent of one another, the gravitational constant, etc.

**Anthropic principle**: Doesn't address the issue. Essentially states that ""if observers evolve in a universe

[Douglas Adams' puddle](http://butdoesitfloat.com/260223/Puddle-thinking): The fine-tuning argument would be if the puddle discovered that it is highly unlikely that a pothole would exist at all. At that point he *might* gain some justification in wondering why his hole exists in the first place.

**Premise 1**: *The fine-tuning of the universe is due to physical necessity

Seems to exhaust all the possibilities. Most others you can think of would probably fit under one of these three. Also, code-named God. Or that there are many universes...""

**Premise 2**: *It is not due to physical necessity*

Even in candidates for the Theory of Everything, such as the amount of entropy and the gravitational constant. Hawking: ""Does string theory predict the state of the universe? The answer is that it does not. It allows a vast landscape of possible universe, in which we occupy an anthropically permitted location.""

**Premise 3**: *It is not due to chance*

The chances of these values all falling into this one range is so great that the chance hypothesis can be dismissed outright. At least

One problem with the multiverse theory is that there is no evidence it exists at all. In addition, the multiverse would itself have to be finely tuned in order to produce multiple universes as well, some of which are capable of life, and thus only serves to move the fine-tuning up a level.

**Premise #1**: *Everything that begins to exist has a cause*

True at first sight by intuition. Things don't pop into existence uncaused out of nothing. Out of nothing

Virtual particles apparently pop into existence without any prior cause. However, virtual particles and beta decay are fully deterministic and thus preserve the causal principle. And even if they were indeterministic, they come into existence from the fluctuating energy in the quantum vacuum, which is not nothing.

Other than the above contentious points

**Premise #2**: *The universe began to exist*

Four sub-arguments support this:

1. [Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_paradox_of_the_Grand_Hotel) shows that an actual infinite leads to paradoxes

2. An actual infinite cannot be created with successive addition. Placing one event after another will be forever finite. Thus

3. The Big Bang model, including cyclic ones, the singularity continues to rear it's ugly head. See [Borde 2003](http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v90/i15/e151301) for more.

4. It has been shown that at least some entropy carries over even in cyclic models

**Conclusion**: *Therefore

*Conceptual analysis of the cause:*

Since space, and the laws of physics were brought into existence, then the cause of this must be external to them and thus spaceless, timeless, non-physical, and ""supranatural.""

Also

1. There are two types of (known) causal explanations: scientific and agent. The cause cannot be scientific as the laws of physics did not exist yet. Therefore

2. Only two things fit the description of a non-physical entity: abstract objects and minds. But abstract objects cannot cause anything. Therefore

3. A timeless cause would lead to a timeless effect. An impersonal cause existing from timeless ""eternity"" would also have it's effect existing from ""eternity"". But the universe came into being a finite time ago and thus

Suppose the Churchlands are right.  Does that mean that there are no beliefs?  No, as Robert Brandom offers, is the right route to take with replacing the psychologistic notion, but that’s beside the point.)

At one point, doubt, etc.  Whatever sort of thing they end up being, physical, non-physical, psychological, social, and if they do

Just like the status of beliefs as psychological states is inessential to their existence *as beliefs, but such a pronoun isn’t available either, so I’ll just stick with “he.”)  

With atheists, has got to go.   But perhaps we can get rid of an idea of God as a supernatural “man in the sky,” and still say that “God exists” if what we are calling “God” still fills the same role that it used to.  Certain Christians, particularly associated [liberal Christianity]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Christianity) and [Christian existentialism]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_existentialism) have already suggested some naturalistic-friendly conceptions of God, that still try to retain the essentials of Christianity enough to be called the Christian God.  The judge of whether these conceptions can function *as God* is, I think, whether the sorts of religious practices can be genuinely and meaningfully done when God is thought of this way.  I’m not embedded enough in religious tradition (having become atheist from a relatively young age) to say whether a naturalism-friendly conception of God can fulfill the traditional roles

The majority of people on this planet are theists, it seems hard to believe that God could just drop out of their understanding of the world.   I think it would be a very sad thing if all religious traditions died out because much of the culture of the world is so intimately tied to religion.  That being said, my metaphysical outlook commits me to a broadly naturalistic picture, and I do hope wide-scale agreement on this basic view of the way the world is can be a possibility for the future.  Since I'm thinking that, to most theists, the religious view of theism is much more important than the metaphysical view of super-naturalism, I'm hoping we can keep the former and drop the latter.

Any thoughts on whether this is possible

Edit:  I should note that by ""naturalism"" I mean a very broad form of *supervenience* naturalism.

Point 1. Refuted by my list of eminent physicists that were Christians contrary to the fool who could only cite Dyson - and even then he lied about him (as I gave a quote from Dyson himself). 

Point 2. No evidence provided for the claim. Claim dismissed.

Point 3: Refuted by my citing dozens of constants when your 'eminent spotty geek' stated there were 'only a few' .

Point 3 cont Realised the person could not respond.

Point 4. I asked for ONE piece of irrefutable evidence that is repeatable and verifiable that proves multiverses exist. 
I'm still waiting. Point refuted. 

Point 5"".Point refuted by explaining the Anthropic Princile further - stating that 'compensating' constants are no argument and gave the reasons why.

Point 6. Carbon. He cannot refute it so he insults. I've already explained the reasoning regarding carbon.As he did not even attempt to refute my point (no doubt he couldn't do so) then there is no need to rebut his refutation. How can I if he doesn't even touch the topic?

Point 7. Follows on from point 6.

Point 8 Rebuttal of this insult by asking why, fourth or fifth alternative. That is reasonable. But of course there isn't any other alternative or he would have cited it. Point refuted.

Point 9. I pointed out the idiocy of this remark

Point 10. Refuted using Einstein himself

Point 11 Ignored as this was merely an insult.

Point 12. Ignored as this was an obscene

Point 13 Asked for ONE repeatable test that has been done that proves multiverses exist

Point 14. Probability clarified

Point 15 . Error in what probability means and its calculation explained with actual figures. Point refuted. 

Point 16. I pointed out the fallacy of the 'cards' illustration. A corollary of point 15 which was refuted - with mathematical evidence.

Point 17. 'Not knowing' when the facts are staring you in the face is a euphemism of 'not wishing to have to admit'. Nothing to refute here because most of this point was an insult directed towards me.

Point 18.Refuted and this contributor pointed out as either mistaken or a liar.

19.Point refuted using Einsteinian relativity. 

20. I was asked for my qualifications so I gave them. No doubt you will now say that I was bragging. But if I hadn't given them you would no doubt then say that I was a liar. So on balance I did as asked. 

21. Explanations given as to why I retired early

As for 'casual insults being uncalled for' 
"" mr timecube""
""read: got fired for trying to push creationism in public schools""
""This guy is SERIOUSLY not worth the time of day.""
""He's so incredibly full of himself ""
"" just keeps repeating the same kind of crap ""

and a particular favourite of mine:

""Fuck these silly goddamn beliefs and shitty illogical arguments.""

... and all these insults in the first response to my email you posted where the ONLY person I spoke negatively of was Richard Dawkins.

Let's take one of the quotes above: """"This guy is SERIOUSLY not worth the time of day."" That applies to you. Frankly I have spent far more time than I should have with you. You argue black is white

So I suggest 

1. You apologise for stating that all I did was insult in my rebuttals in my last email

2. start growing up and thinking for yourself

I think I'll go off now and spend a good few hours arguing that the (probably) fictional character Robin Hood really did marry the almost certainly fictional character Maid Marion. Absurd? That's exactly what you are doing it seems as you regard God as fiction and yet you seem to spend a heck of a lot of time debating Him

Positive atheism is the thesis that no God exists (as opposed to negative atheism

Positive Atheists usually aren't semanticists or philosophers. For that reason

A supreme being who created the universe. 

On this definition

There is no supreme being who is such that they created the universe. 

Although this is ambiguous. Does the ""there is no"" take wide or narrow scope here? Are atheists saying that there may be some supreme beings, then, atheism is the denial of supreme beings on this construal. 

But what is a supreme being? Presumably an atheist might say ""well you know, the wisest, the coolest, the friendliest to them. Presumably god is the least evil, the least mean, the least bitchy, the least etc. for any bad properties. For god is the g-ist and the least e-ist where g is any good property (besides necessary existence) and e is any bad property. 

Assuming the atheist can provide some objective criterion on which to distinguish good and bad properties (e.g. assuming moral naturalism), if a being has g do the degree d (where d is an element of the natural numbers), presumably that being could have g to d+1, or d+2, and so on, right? Couldn't god always have *more* happiness? *more* coolness? *More* love? This seems to be a common thesis, that there is never too much of a good thing. If this is true, stipulate that there was a highest level of goodness for g-having, so on). If they are natural, it would take a *huge* amount of work on the part of a scientist to develop such a theory

If I had to choose I'd say I am an Agnostic. I am not a scholar

My question is not about philosophical arguments

I was raised a Catholic and was only through constant self questioning of my own beliefs that I became an Agnostic. I believe questioning my own beliefs and ideas is the thing that keeps me sane and true. I very seldom trust myself absolutely on any idea

I have had very nurturing discussions with Atheists and Agnostics as well as religious people and ministers when they are willing to just talk freely and honestly.

But I feel very disappointed here. I am a man and I feel like crying. Most of the time I try to start what I believe is an open minded discussion with Atheists I feel like I am running against a wall of dogma. I have been mistaken for a troll by people who seem to think I am set to anger them when I am just trying to talk or question what I believe are hard coded arguments either for or against god. It seems to me that there is only one correct way to think about god in these parts and that my way of thinking is never welcome.

EDIT: Ok

* There is a God; everything is this God. No one can truly reach God with prayer or some type of contact and every soul is made from said God. It is all and all is it.

* I believe in something called the astral plane and spiritual evolution. When you pass, all knowledge is available to you, and no one or thing has a physical form. Sensory details are much more varied, i.e. more colors than what we see here, ability to feel emotions never felt before, etc.  Here is where you will reincarnate after some time spent reflecting on your past lives or you will be able to move one and kind of ""graduate"" to a higher being depending on how well you have fulfilled your purpose here on the physical plane. I also believe in spirit guides.  They are entities who once were in our position, but have since progressed spiritually and are there to help guide you along your right path without actually telling you your path.

* I believe everyone and everything has love in them.  Give a person enough time

* Obviously I believe in reincarnation and karma. No explanation of that really needed

The first is that omnipotence is not bound by any logic and truely limitless.  For example an omnipotent being can make a square with 6 sides.  A square by definition is an object with 4 sides but that doesn't stop such a being from creating one with 6 and it still being a square.  Now omnipotence is a word we use to communicate so if this is the accepted way you want to treat the word it does render any objection meaningless and really any discussion so.

Because omnipotence isn't bound by logic or reason you can problem with say the Bible can be handwaved away.  Can an omnipotent God who is all knowing and all good create a world completely full of unneccessary evil all without comprimising its all goodness?  Sure.  Can such a being make a rock that it can't lift without making something it can't do?  Sure.  Any and all problem can be handwaived away but it cuts both ways.  It does nothing to support any religions stance because omnipotence allows for the case to be the opposite while still providing all the reasons to believe something else.  So lets call this irrational omnipotence.

So if you want to use the other kind, it does limit the questions that can be asked.  The old making a huge rock question becomes a nonsense question to ask.  The question can be approached two ways with this sort of omnipotence.  ""Can God, who can lift any rock, lift this rock?""  Or ""Can God lift this rock that God can't lift?""  Or when you strip out the specifics completely.  ""Can God who can do this thing that God can't do, do this thing?""  Either the answer is allready in the question or it becomes nonsensical.

Going with the latter definition at least allows for some more debate though on both sides.  So I ask to you when you think about the word omnipotent and its meanings for athiests and theists which do meaning do you mean because which you choose is entirely going to shape how a debate will go.",,t5_2ryfy,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/mcua6/two_flavors_of_omnipotence/

***Ex-Catholic here***. *While I cannot say I am masterfully well-versed with the entirety of Catholic doctrines

The views are actually quite simple: Catholicism argues that homosexuality is unnatural. Anything natural by most Christian definitions is that which is a result of God's intentions (or in accordance with it). It is also argued within this belief that one must only marry someone if they are truly in love. Now, it is impossible for two people of the same sex to fall in love (intimately). Love is God, and anything related to God is natural, so by default, love can only be achieved through natural means.

Onto the subject of sex now. First of all, premarital sex and protected sex. Feel free to ask about the last two in the comments (I won't be expanding on them here). Having said all that, it is *not mandatory* to have sex with the person you love. Additionally, having children with the person you love is also *not mandatory*. While reproduction is encouraged in Christian faiths, it is not a requirement.

* Going allll the way back up to the top, people seem to like to fight, as if it were something to win. Atheists believe that Christians are wrong, Christians believe that Atheists are wrong.

Yet, or both can be wrong. The only possibility that can’t occur is that we’re both completely correct.  I’m not doing this to win some non-existent prize, I’m doing this because the science tells me there’s nothing in the sky. We know there’s no hell below us. But I’ll get into this stuff later maybe. I don’t want to come off as dismissive from the start. 

* Because of this, how can they believe this, and vice versa, or challenges. I completely understand it, but I don't agree with it. It's never out of curiosity that one side talks to the other side, it's always out of either proving that the other side is wrong, proving that your side is right

Well thanks for the kind words. I’ll do my best to live up to them. It is kind of distressing to see people insisting things that aren’t there

It’s easy to compare stories we think of as alike. We can easily imagine Spock meeting Yoda. We can imagine Thor meeting Hercules. We can imagine Mario meeting Sonic. 

It would be VERY easy to think that someone who actually believed Sonic the Hedgehog was real, “delusional” is the most appropriate word. That it is the most appropriate also makes it overused. I try to think and use words properly. Stupid is a word better to describe specific actions, not people as a whole. 

I believe I hold in my head, you’d have to admit you’re curious how people that are so massively informed about this stuff can be so certain that your God is a fictional being that never existed. How is it that I don’t even have a slight fear of hell? Ok moving on. 

 * To get down to your actual post now... (Thanks for clearing that up

I was never intending to dismiss you

* I also never said that He was my god. I am basically a freak of nature. Half Christian / Half Atheist. I have been heavily on either side of the ""fence."" Was raised a Christian

Well that makes a bit of sense. I can’t say I’ll be impartial

* It's a really interesting vantage point and I enjoy it. I really wish that I could shit or get off the pot

If you stand on the fence too long your feet will begin to hurt and your legs will cramp. Sitting on the pot too long could give you a nasty case of hemorrhoids. (a clever response that really doesn’t translate to anything meaningful when converted back to your analogy. That’s the problem with analogies

* So again, the Christian God desires for people to love him.

And he punishes them if they don’t. 

* He's not an evil king that will throw someone down a dungeon

Right

* and he doesn't hate fags. No

I still argue that it isn’t even possible. If classic literature tells us anything

* I'm sure you could brainwash yourself if you tried hard enough. [assume that god is real] He's not going to hurl a fireball down on someone for cursing him.

We’re talking about a God that turned a woman to salt for looking back at the people he was throwing fireballs at. He’ll do worse to you for less. 

* I think it's really interesting that atheists always take on the view that God is so evil

Um

* To debate good and evil would take a while, I hope that they don't. I can't think of what you mean by ill tempered, give me an example please. If you're talking about Old Testament references of him killing people and children, I hate to sound inhumane, but he can. I was listening to a debate where one side argued that it wasn't morally right to, if you created a sentient creature, or robot

Have to disagree. Once the robot is sentient, the robot is essentially flawless. Now before the creator builds the robot, he knows the robot is going to ""need to be killed"" (in HIS opinion), and when it will ""need to be killed"", it will not want to die. The question then isn’t “should it be killed?” they are “should it be created?” and “isn’t his eventual ""need to be killed"" the creators fault?” 

Isn’t it cruel to create a life form knowing you’re going to kill it? And let’s not pull punches here. I’m only borrowing TWO of  God’s divine attributes. The ability to create a flawless being, no rush. He could also read the minds of the beings before he created them right? So he knew the pain and anguish the robot would feel as HE was killing it, before he wrote up the plans. God could have created a robot that would have lived a happy life. Instead he chose to build one that he would get to kill. Let’s not use “have to” when it comes to God though. He makes it very clear he doesn’t HAVE to do anything. (But that’s a story for another time- Hint: “Jesus ""had to"" die for your sins”)

Therefore, the ultimate authority by which Scripture is shown to be God's words must be Scripture itself.

'We all have the same evidence. We just understand it differently. However when you use evidence your using knowledge. How can you have knowledge apart from God?

'How do I know its not imaginary? Revelation from God. You have the same revelation I have. Just the difference is that I'm proclaiming it and your suppressing it. All knowledge and certainty comes from the God of the Bible alone (Proverbs 1:7).'

Fellow atheist here

I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit that I only just learned about the Catholic belief that Jesus himself founded the Catholic church (I'm 29

For example

The reason this is interesting to me is because it exploited a hole in my fairly extensive arsenal for debating with theists.  One of my go-to methods is to show the unreliability of the bible as a source.  I thought that without the bible

The gist of the response I got was ""the Catholic church was there before the bible (as we know it today) - the bible is *of* the church, because the bible is secondary to the history of the church.

For some reason that has left me a little tongue tied.  

In my research so far

I know there are some obvious things surrounding the issue of Jesus' divinity (because it seems the consensus is this ""Jesus"" character of the bible was a real person

Really

Basically the goal of this thread is, *we* were the ones that compiled the damn thing.  So I still know (without relying on the bible) that there is a God, and that God is the Christian God.""

Any possible rebuttals or theists who have an answer please send it my way. 

 The objection I often raise to theists who I like to debate with normal follows some one using Pascals wager as a defense but it is more directly a problem with the concept of hell.  If a person truly believes that people will go to hell as most fundamentalists I argue with do, marrying, it all seems so trivial and selfish to focus on instead of saving people from that pain and suffering. 

A defense I've heard for proselytizing is along the lines of if you see a truck coming toward an oblivious person you try to save them. Only this is not just one person it's hundreds of thousands of people all laying down on a road unaware of a coming truck. Stopping to chat up a pretty girl instead of yelling about the truck would seem morally reprehensible. Stopping to work and get that raise, men and women of all ages.

I'm the lone atheist in my circle of friends. It's mostly normal Christians and a few fundies. We frequently get into theological debates on a variety of topics. Evolution gets brought up a lot, you are less moral.

My counter-argument to this is that they don't have any real proof of that beyond anecdotal cherry picked evidence. They typically go to the Mao-Stalin-Pulpot argument which I refute with them being not causative with atheism. I'll typically then ask them what moral teaching does religion impart that you can't arrive at rationally as an atheist. They say charity/altruism. I then explain the evolutionary basis of altruism. They then say Christians are more altruistic and more moral in general. From here the argument devolves into a series of subjective assertions and

**What I want to know is...** Are there any empirical studies out there about atheism and morality? Any studies or figures which show atheists to be less/more philanthropic, adulterous, exploitative, or any other quality associated with morality. I'd prefer studies which are more empirically based (e.g. criminality statistics) and control for external factors if possible. I'd also prefer studies that deal with the US population (although I welcome all studies) because it would carry more weight amongst my group of friends. I don't want any anecdotal stuff and would prefer studies that aren't overly survey based.

I don't do much philosophy stuff. He's not being very convincing to me personally but he thinks he's figured out proof that God HAS to exist. (Now as to how he gets the Christian God from that I've yet to hear...)

Here are his beliefs as I understand them so far. The universe has to be either finite or infinite. It can't be infinite because that would create an infinite regression of causation

For that cause he names the solution God and says that there are certain things that God would have to be in order to be that answer. Let me copy/paste some of the stuff he has said. 

Now the question of God and how you determine if it is reasonable to accept the God might depend on how you define God. I went through a mental exercise a few months ago:

Q. What is God?

Q. Is God something?

Q. What is something?

A. Something is some thing.

Q. What is a thing?

A. A thing is that which has definition.

Q. What is definition?

A. Definition is 'de' meaning of or from &amp; 'finition' for finite

A. Therefore

A. God is not something. Which is not to say that God does not exist but rather that God is that which exists that is not a thing. As the Bible says

So what can be said that is true of that which exists that is not a thing? You can know:

God does not have parts or otherwise one part would lack what another has.

God does not change

God has only one thought that encompasses all. For if he had many thoughts

God is eternal. For if God were not

He linked to [this page](http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm) and especially noted Article 3.

He also says God is nothing and that 

There are two types of nothing: t

That which does not exist

That which exists

He also says that claims which are self evident don't need to be proved because the claims are the proof

I'm still waiting for responses on many of the things he has said since he seems to ""miss"" lots of the questions I've asked him. I'm expecting his latest reply to come in a bit later tonight.

Anyways, you're familiar with the concept. But if not, I'll give a quick summary with links and my knowledge of it: 

Basically, life would no be possible anywhere. 

Now, there truly only three plausible explanations of fine-tuning: ""Informed scientists now universally recognise that the Universe is exquisitely finely tuned to allow the coming into being of intelligent life. The only reasonable debate is whether this is due to:

a. A Loving Ultimate Creator
b. An extraordinary coincidence
c. The fact that there exists an infinity (or near-infinity) of other 'Universes' in which the constants are different

(c) is preferred by eg Martin Rees in his book Just Six Numbers, now at UPenn), proposes that any logically possible universe exists in the Multiverse. Since the existence of God is not logically impossible, it follows that God must exist in at least one Universe, but if God exists at all God must exist in all Universes (otherwise God would not be an ultimate creator).""
Link — http://www.starcourse.org/discussion/anthropic.html

Now, claims that our universe isn't fine-tuned. You can see such arguments thoroughly dismantled by Luke Barnes here: http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.4647 

I would like to sum up my thoughts on fine-tuning through this quote by John Polkinghorne, the rather desperate expedient of invoking an immense array of unobservable worlds seems the only other recourse.”

Not long ago I posted in /r/DebateReligion with my take on the modal ontological argument

I've thought about it for a while since then

Last time I rambled on quite a lot. I was going to try to shorten it but realised I can't without leaving out key points.

First off

1. Maximal excellence is being omnipotent
2. Maximal greatness is having maximal excellence in all possible worlds.

Ignoring the contradictions of the Three-O's

Now, and is a complete set of reality. In fact, that's how I've heard it described, also often as a ""maximal state of affairs"", of which the actual world is one.

You're asked to then accept ""A maximally great being is possible"". OK

The issue is you're asked to accept that it's possible in some world, no. Maximal greatness is either maximal excellence in all, or none.

I won't be caught out by this trickery. Maximal greatness is defined clearly already. There's no existing in just 1 world. That would be maximal excellence.

So, then is he going to be maximally excellent, or maximally great? Well, only 1 of these possible worlds is the actual world, and so God would only be existing in 1 world, and so he'd be maximally excellent.

The argument (Edit: Craig's version) concludes with ""A maximally great being exists in the actual world"" which could only be the case if all possible worlds were actual worlds. So, and not just unsound.

What then, talk to the people of World 2, unless World 1 and World 2 exist at the same time. If they can exist at the same time, then what stops there being more than 1 actual world?

Am I supposed to accept that all possible worlds have to contain God? Can't possible worlds not have God in it? It doesn't matter if these worlds can contain God or not, unless these possible worlds are existing at the same time.

What then is a possible world, and if a God that exists in all universes exists in 1 universe, then it exists in all universes, but at this point it's just the same as Anselm's original ontological argument, not to mention the conclusion is part of the premise.

So here it is dumbed down:

1. If God necessarily exists
2. It is possible God necessarily exists.
3. Therefore

Nice try.

Last time, though to be honest I haven't seen examples of its use in other arguments.

&gt;For one thing, etc.), which can still potentially be valid but is far different from direct observation.

&gt;Whether large-scale evolution has occurred isn't really a question of speciation, specifically to the genetic information. For the change to occur from an ape-like common primate ancestor to modern humans (assuming there's about a 2% difference in our genetic information), millions of beneficial genetic changes would first have to occur, then be significant enough to survival to be selected, then spread throughout the population enough so as not to be lost. All this was supposed to have happened in a few million years. Even if these sorts of genetic changes were common, which they aren't, there wasn't enough time or generations of the species for that sort of change to occur.

It seems like he admits that there is evidence for large scale change due to evolution but I am not sure how to answer the human question. I have a few thoughts but I wanted to see your guys' opinions. I also had a rough time finding sources for this topic specifically?

**Continued:**
His next response:

&gt;I don't think your definition of macro evolution is accurate, this definition of macro-evolution is one that tells us almost nothing about how life went from a single organism to the extreme diversity we see today. I'm not trying to move the goal posts, just pointing out that a goal you score between these posts isn't worth very many points towards understanding how life developed.

&gt;The reason there would need to be so many changes is because of the size of primate genomes and the estimated 2-4% difference between those of humans and their closest living relatives. With the human genome having over 3 billion base pairs, of changes to occur between humans and our primate ancestor, there would first have to be that many mutations, which take quite some time at 175 per generation (one estimate I found--http://www.genetics.org/content/156/1/297.full). In fact, to get a 2% change in 3 billion pairs at 175 changes per generation would take over 340,000 generations, and with large primates, the closer you get to modern humans, cannot act on

&gt;I am aware that single-point mutations are not the only mutations that occur. But first of all, they’re always random. If you expect random changes to produce great progress, you’re betting against the house. Even if a larger portion of the genome is somehow duplicated in one generation, all you get is the same information over again. It’s not a viable method for producing something like the human brain, which as far as we know is the greatest supercomputer in existence, no matter how much time you have.

&gt;I think that a better explanation for machinery far more complex that what the best human minds have ever been able to come up with is a designer with a mind far greater than those of humans. But what I believe is irrelevant. Scientific theories aren’t innocent until proven guilty. Whether they offer a good explanation does not depend on whether there are any better explanations available. Of course,False,,t5_2ryfy,1339544045.0,,,t3_uweiw
1335466349.0,styp3,My father and I just had a long and interesting conversation about the conflict between Science and Religion. He says there isn't one and provides an interesting thought... (X-post from r/atheism),lonelyonlyleft,19,10,41,"My father is a High School teacher (possibly one of the most well-read people I know) and for 20 years taught Biology and Chemistry. After a transfer he was put in a position to teach Religion (Catholic HS

He offered an argument put forth by a Jesuit priest, from early in the 20th century, is that Religion and Science are NOT competing ideologies but rather parallel ideologies. He says that Christ is not just an anthropological event but also a cosmic phenomenon as well. I quote:

""Simply put

The resurrection opens us to possibilities beyond this life. It gives us a meta-future. But it gives a meta-future to the world, human persons, are only that part of God's creation that has become self-conscious and we do not stand apart from the earth and it does not exist simply for our benefit, like a stage for the actor, to be abandoned after the show. Physical creation has value in itself, independent of us.

Moreover, mortal, subject to decay, dying. Science clearly teaches us this. The laws of entropy tell us that the universe is running down, the sun is burning out, all energy is finite. The earth's days are numbered, counted. It will take millions of years but finitude is finitude. Like us

This is what St Paul refers to in the Epistle to the Romans when he tells us that creation is subject to futility and

The resurrection brought into our world a new power, and something so radically novel that it can only be compared to what happened at the initial creation when our universe first started. At the dawn of creation the atoms and molecules of this universe were made out of nothing, ex nihilo, nature took shape, and its reality and physical laws held sway from then on - until the resurrection of Jesus.

In the resurrection of Jesus the very atoms of the universe were rearranged. The laws of physics were somehow stunningly altered and because of that our planet now too has the possibility of eternal life.""

So in theory, but rather in a parallel dimension, not consisting of physical atoms how we understand them, but as forms of energy. When he appeared to his apostles and then vanished he brought with him hope for life beyond the physical existence that we currently understand. Words did not exist to explain it properly either. If you read Genesis, the descriptions are vague; (Gen 1:2) ""Now the earth was a formless void, there was darkness over the deep, and God's spirit hovered over the water."" For Moses

Similarly, and only through invention and deep study do we reveal small aspects of our incredible complexity. In this light, Science and Religion are parallel. Burden of proof is not an appropriate argument because it cuts both ways.

A belief in life after death then is reasonable if we consider a meta-physical transformation of matter into energy. Time therefore is the only thing binding us to our physical reality. Once time is over there will be nothing

1326825349.0,ol56o,Ongoing Debate with Christian on the reliability of the New Testament writers. His most recent response. What do you think?,Quest4truth11,13,2,62,"Sorry for the length
This is his complete e-mail to me

ME (skeptical stance):
“I want to clarify something from my last e-mail that I think was misunderstood. I did not mean to say that there are no outside sources that mention Jesus

Christian:
When you consider that Jesus' active ministry lasted roughly three years, the gospel record is technically considered oral history as opposed to oral tradition because it contains information passed down by living witnesses. One of the classic studies on this matter is by Swedish scholar Birger Gerhardsson - 
http://www.amazon.com/Reliability-Gospel-Tradition-Birger-Gerhardsson/dp/1565636678/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1326822283&amp;sr=8-2-fkmr1

So the idea that the gospels contain hearsay written too late to be reliable is simply false.

I think many of your comments reflect a certain chronological snobbery that virtually equates ""ancient"" with ""ignorant"" or ""supersitious."" And your default view seems to be that ancient people were not capable of passing along and preserving accurate history. This reflects an ethnocentric bias which is common


 ME (skeptical stance):
“The earliest writings we have referencing Jesus are the biased Christian sources of the gospels and the letters. The reason that is significant is because while Jesus was alive he was said to have wide fame, or even to call him a popular magician or anything. All we have from people that claim to have actually seen him are some debatable letters (as to who wrote them) that say little about him,  Paul's letters (who didn't see Jesus, but knew people who claimed they had,) and maybe the gospel of John written by an eyewitness (though, also highly debated). These are all biased sources written by people with the intent of spreading Christianity. And we know and can observe everyday people who fib a little in order to spread the greater good, or to spread their agenda. I am not saying Paul did that
 
Christian:
Once again you raise the issue of ""bias."" There is no such thing as ""unbiased"" history. All history is written from a point of view. Do you think the hyper-skeptics that you have read (like Robert Price) are unbiased? So let's set aside the matter of agenda

Second, how many of the biographies in your bookcase would have to be dismissed as reliable? 

 
ME:
Paul says he knew the people who knew Jesus, who are the disciples verses ""the twelve,"" what were the happenings based on that incident and such. Paul says nothing about the happenings around the empty tomb. Paul, the only writer that we can confirm to have known the people who knew Jesus is the one that had the littlest to say about Jesus' actual physical life on earth. Yes, it could be that he didn't mention them because that was already known information at the time, and his point was to address the Christians who already believed, but still, physical attestation to him. To me it seems very plausible, may have believed he was seen again, even in group settings. Also

Christian:
Several things:
1.  What discrepancies are there between Paul's letters and the gospels?
2.  Where are you getting evidence that Paul is the only one we can confirm who knew people who knew Jesus? This is a bizarre claim. I don't know of any scholar who denies Mark knew Peter
3.  The reason you don't find the evidence of the women self-damaging is because you are reading the accounts with no knowledge of the beliefs and practices of the first century. This is a widely commented on detail acknowledged by scholars on all points of the spectrum.

 ME:
“You said:
'As far as elaboration goes

Yes, that Jesus was the son of God? I don't think we have enough to confirm that. More likely, an eloquent teacher and leader that had a bit of a following, who was crucified and shortly afterward thought to have been seen alive. Thus, many of his sayings were preserved from memory, and eventually written down, the story of his life became exaggerated by his followers. His appearances, the empty tomb, fallible people. If all you have attesting to Jesus' resurrection and god-hood are biased sources

Christian: 
Once again

If what you mean is that the resurrection of Jesus can't be proven like 2+2 = 4, the most likely conclusion is that Jesus rose from the dead. You may draw a different conclusion, but you can't simply say ""there is no proof.""

Until very recently

Religion's functional definition has nothing to do with any particular belief. Rather, no matter if his heart is in it or not.

Religious beliefs and practices are arbitrary. Their arbitrariness makes it possible to maintain an esoteric tradition

Religious beliefs and practices are complex. Their complexity serves as a form of indoctrination, maintain the oral tradition. In some special cases, like those of Judaism, Christianity, and Buddhism, that priestly class evolved into today's academic class.

(An example of a similar, serve to make literacy in China a form of cultural indoctrination. That is, you can't learn Chinese characters well without being -- becoming -- Chinese, in a sense. When the Mongols conquered China, they put on Chinese clothes and adopted Chinese rites. They didn't do the same in Hungary.)

Science is not arbitrary, a question:

Can a modern human society be stably arranged around the pursuit of science? How will the Enlightenment

A tangential question: If the U.S. is an experiment in creating an Enlightened society

Agnosticism:  the view that the truth value of certain claims—especially claims about the existence or non-existence of any deity

1) Any positive claim for the existence of a diety must set an operating definition for said diety.  For example, or a pot, or some sort of metaphysical noncorporeal energy is completely nonsensical.  If god were cat, then we would call it a cat and not god.  An operating definition MUST be stated for said diety, like saying the Christian God exists, or the Muslim God exists, or the Hindu Gods exist.  

EDIT:  Again

2) Said operating definition will set certain observable conditions.  For example, or that Jesus existed historically.  Obviously, similar conditions will be set for other dieties.

3) These observable conditions can therefore be disproven.  This is a condition where the absence of evidence actually IS evidence of absence.   For example
     
   3a) If the diety in question is one who does not interact with or intevene in the Universe in any way shape or form
and will therefore never set any observable conditions that would provide evidence for or against its existence
then the diety may as well not exist anyway

The answer to this in the comments was pretty much universally negative.  No one acknowledged wanting to believe.  I was extremely surprised by this as I know there are plenty of ex-christians like me in this subreddit.  Doesn't anyone feel

Belief in God gave me strength when I had none and comforted me in hard times.  I never felt fearful for my future as my life was under the guidance of God.  Whenever I felt lonely I reminded myself that my best friend, purpose and meaning.  Those things were all defined by God, and I didn't need to worry about them.  I just needed to follow his guidance.

For context

This section is talking about God's Providence

Here is the text in question:

&gt;God, with all its distinctive characteristics. He causes the paper on which this sentence is written to continue to act like paper - so that it does not spontaneously dissolve into water and float away or change into a living thing and begin to grow! Until it is acted on by some other part of creation and thereby its properties are changed (for instance, until it is burned with fire and becomes ash), this paper will continue to act like paper so long as God preserves the earth and the creation he has made.

&gt;God's providence provides a basis for science: God has made and continues to sustain a universe that acts in predictable ways. If a scientific experiment gives a certain result today,"" but because God's providence sustains a universe in which created things maintain the properties with which he created them.

To me the answer to this riddle is that God (though this law could be as purely a natural phenomena as say the fact that like charges repel and opposites attract) has implanted in nature some type of governing law that is overseeing the evolutionary paths of species in order to guarantee some form of sentience.  For reference I'm going to call it the ""Law of Assisted Sentience"" that is responsible for something in God's image to be created.

I would like to start out by saying that I am, as a religious person, I feel that I understand the rationale of atheists/non-religious people. I can see why you, if you are a non-believer, would look at religious oppression throughout history, ignorance, outlandish beliefs, the veracities of science, hatred, as being sufficient evidence to say

I read r/Atheism every now and then, or if they are openly opposed to religion. In either case, I believe religion is here to stay. Religion will prove to be as risilient as mankind itself, even if there is no God/gods. I say this because some people will believe because they want to believe. Some people just won't accept the idea that maybe death really is the absolute end of us. Additionally, some people, myself included, find peace and happiness in religious beliefs.

Now, and this could all turn out to be pointless because maybe there really is no God. However, that doesn't much matter to me, because I still find increased happiness in my religion, and of nothing happens when I die, how would I be capable of caring that I wasted my efforts? On the contrary, if there really is a God, if you currently have no belief thereof

I'm not going to say that atheists/non-religious people are going to be subject to Hellfire or eternal damnation, is a merciful, forgiving, and loving God. And you may say, ""if he's so loving, why does he allow his so-called 'followers' to do so much wrong? And why would he allow things like disease, and poverty to happen?"" This is a tough question for me to answer. Not because I don't have an answer, I will be ridiculed as a religious nut-case. Such an answer requires some degree of religious maturity to fully grasp. Regardless

Let me summarize

If I am religious
If I am religious and I am happy because of it
If I am atheist/non-religious
(don't stop reading after this next sentence
If I am atheist/non-religious

I'll concede that this logic is far too incomplete to make a viable argument

I'm not saying that all religions are correct, are not followers of God, if he exists, that is. Furthermore, I have found that people affiliated with those religions are not happy because of it. If you practice religion, you should only do so with the intent to do good, and to have a genuine love of all men. God does not hate anybody. He doesn't hate gays, and if any liturgical texts like the Bible are true

I know I am not perfect. I know that I can't say that I have a genuine love of all men, and bury the hatchet. Furthermore, it is not sufficient to say that you have a genuine love of all men, if all you do is say, ""I have a genuine love of all men."" you have to express your love through your actions. I know the word love may seem a bit strange or uncomfortable to use, but that's really what we are supposed to do, if we are supposed to do anything at all. This is how religious practices should be, regardless of if it is true or not.

If you are wondering what my religious affiliation is, I do not find that my church is a cult. All that aside, let's discuss this idea a civil manner.

One of the most common criticisms of religion in general is that it requires having beliefs based on faith; that is, but do we not agree that that is quite a bit different than claiming to know that divine beings don't exist (stating it as if its fact)? To me it seems like the former is completely rational while the latter is much more faith based. 

This is my general argument in regards to this: There's evidence to indicate that the universe did have a beginning and the big bang is our best explanation for the ""event"" that brought forth our universe. However

I ask this because I see the agnostic point of view as much more honest and rational although it is admittedly fence-sitting.

Second question and also completely unrelated. To you as atheists,' but they are as scientifically ignorant as a fundamentalist christian. They typically adopt the mindset in their later teens when they express hedonism in its purest form and disregard religion because it makes them feel accountable for their actions. I talked about this to an atheist friend of mine and he initially dismissed it. He got back to me about a month later because he started to think I was right. So my question is simply what are your thoughts on these people? Do you find them just as ignorant as any religious individual or do you find yourself being more accepting of them in comparison?

**Edit**: For the most part there was some interesting discussion. My first question was mostly answered by people pointing out the difference between agnostic atheism vs. gnostic atheism.

Not an infallible entity with all these properties that are attributed to a god such as giving a shit about us puny inconsequential humans.  I may still be stuck on the before the universe question.  You can talk about dimensions and M-brane theory all you want about the pre-big bang what created the first universe and where did that come from.  The prevailing answer is nothing.  Although our universe may have came from nothing current theory suggest that its on the edge of another universe and the like but there are already other universes that came before it.

Hey [Me]

You sounded very confident in your assertions that the Old Testament has nothing to do with Jesus so I am not sure you are open to anything that is contrary to that belief. Just in case you are open to it

                
               *and the LORD has laid on him
                                the iniquity of us all.
                He was oppressed
                                yet he opened not his mouth;
                like a lamb that is led to the slaughter
                                and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent
                                so he opened not his mouth.
                By oppression and judgment he was taken away;
                                and as for his generation
                that he was cut off out of the land of the living

Here is a Wikipedia link to the chapter – you can see the authenticity of the book and how Judaism interprets the chapter today in that in refers to Israel not Jesus – what else are they going to do with it?

I have no desire to debate whether your interpretation of an old testament verse actually references Jesus. Interpretations are subjective and can mean many different things to many people. If the passage speaks to you and says Jesus, and honestly, it’s besides the point.

Specifically, and worshipped the Hebrew God Yahweh. They were Jews as I understand it. Which makes sense, since both Judaism and Christianity read from the Old Testament. And in this light, a criticism that Islam “apes” Christianity sounds ridiculous.

Hey bro!

Just saw this (your emails go to my junk folder :) - just kidding

We don’t have to debate things bro – while I agree that interpretations can be subjective it doesn’t follow that there wouldn’t be a single, “all are subjective and can mean many different things to many people – and it’s ok”. That is an absolute truth claim about the Bible that would be impossible to prove since your thesis would involve allowing contradictions, which is illogical. It’s a very postmodern way of looking at things – “what’s true for you is true for you, but may not be true for others.” This in turn leads to no truth at all – well expect for the fact that there would be a single, absolute truth claim left, “what’s true for you is true for you, but may not be true for others.” This statement of course would contradict itself making it an illogical statement and invalid for anyone that is seeking to be logical – unless of course you don’t adhere to reason. :) 

While you may fail to understand how Israelites in the Old Testament were,329.489, but it doesn’t mean it isn’t a fact :) You do realize you also took information from the scriptures and stated objective truths about the them – OT figures were from Israel, spoke Hebrew, and worshipped the Hebrew God Yahweh. How is your interpretation of what you read not subjective? 

I still don’t follow how you have a problem with Islam or other religions that are similar to Christianity

Anyways

Consider the act of killing someone (or something). If you kill a dangerous bacteria or virus such as the Ebola virus, you are not really doing something good, although it is not necessarily bad. But if you kill an innocent human being (assuming there are no extenuating circumstances), then the act is very bad. 

&gt;What this shows is that how evil an act is, stealing from them, etc.) is very serious because human beings have great value, how much more serious is it to wrong a being of infinite value and worth? It is unimaginably evil. That’s why it is so incredibly evil when people fail to give God the worship and glory that he is due.

I would describe myself as agnostic, as it does not take into account the cultural meaning of the words as developed over history beyond the literal meaning or dictiopnary definition, translated from greek or latin.

I see a middle ground between theism and atheism, without adequate means of experimenting on the theory, would require a null hypothesis to be adopted, which would be complete impartiality.

  To assume that all of this was put together by chance is beyond belief.  The late H. Quastler calculated the odds as 1 in 10 with 301 zeros.

Now, then of course it is pretty much impossible.  But evolution has no master plan that it is trying to achieve.  It all started from chemistry, and the molecules that were best at reproducing themselves did just that.  There was no great design or blueprint to result in a human being.  Furthermore, evolutionary theory doesn't state that a bunch of organs floated around in a primordial soup and collided until a human was created.

The New Testament accounts do not provide a real ""biography"" for Jesus until you look at the Gospels. The earlier Pauline epistles imply only that he was a god

There is no contemporaneous evidence of a historic Jesus. The only one that ever existed before was a mention of him in the Josephus Records. However

http://freethoughtpedia.com/wiki/Silence_that_screams

This video is also fantastic as well. Probably more amusing.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvleOBYTrDE""

Here is his response to the matter.

""Okay I checked out your links TheTreeMan and they were pretty good. I understand you won't give any credit to the New Testament or the gospels as being remotely historical so I won't bother to argue that in particular (though there is a lot to be said on it though). However the entire premise of your article relies upon the notion that the gospels were not contemporary and were written around the 2nd century. This notion has in fact been heavily challenged in recent scholarship and now many experts in manuscript dating agree that Matthew was written at least before 60 CE. Much earlier than previously believed. Also philologists who pay attention to dialects, etc in language have been proven very accurate in modern times. Experts in some of the latest philological research have dated all four of the Gospels somewhere between 40 and 50 CE. This would suggest that previous conceptions that date the gospels much later than Jesus were incorrect and that they may have been written only a decade or so after his death; a far cry from the 30-70 years as is regularly believed. In my opinion the dates of the writing is at the very least an open question but can be argued as being quite earlier than originally thought.Still, I anticipate that this would do absolutely nothing to lend credibility to the Gospels in your mind. 

So I'll answer the articles speculation that ""They would have noticed"" a preacher like Jesus. There is very good criticism of secular references and that's all well and good (I could go over each and offer commentary but i'll lend you the bulk of those arguments). I would offer one objection I think he overlooked. In some ways it falls into 'Jesus was a minor figure' category but I didn't see him address this point particularly. 

During this period of Jewish history there was literally constant and significant unrest in Judea between 6 CE and the eventual huge revolt in 66 CE. It is very compelling to look at the various violent upsurges and common messianic preachers who were present during this period because it provides an important context to compare Jesus' career and likeness with. I would argue that Roman/secular writers were much more concerned with various violent revolt starters who threatened not only Jewish authorities but more importantly the Roman control of the volatile territory. The article's author tries to present a situation where Jesus would have been the 'Beatles' of his day bc the gospels seem to elaborate this. Not only is this ridiculous because communications and any possible 'pop' culture of the ancient world can't be compared to modern times, if you will, who all preached a more violent and explosive message more prone to being noticed. It is very feasible for him to be overshadowed and of very little contemporary interest outside of his limited sphere of apostles.

Now I wanna touch on the ideas that crucifixion couldn't have been a punishment and also that later Christians had to have fabricated everything. As a result of all these violent revolting messianic preachers that characterized Jesus' time there was massive fear within the authorities. It is not enough to simply claim that the letter of the Roman or Jewish law precluded Jesus from being crucified. Again

A final reason that he wouldn't have been any more well known than the many other messianic preachers is that his message was curiously different and frankly less appealing, it is completely counterintuitive to speculate that a group of people would go against the grain and try to impose a message of non-violence, acceptance of gentiles, etc just out of the blue.

*Team pink*: atheists who do not believe because there is no convincing evidence for God. In case God could and would be proven beyond question



*Team black*: atheists who reject God, it would still be necessary to refuse Him. 



Personally, or in case of Allah, become Muslim instantly, &amp;c. There is much more to a religion than the mere existence of its deities. If Loki exists, he’d still be an asshole (a wonderful and funny asshole, but still) and I would have little inclination to become his blind follower. A frequently mentioned incentive for belief is reward or punishment after death.  If a terrorist would force me against my will, threatening with hellish torture in case I refuse, the bribery of heaven is equally dishonourable and I would “most respectfully return Him the ticket.”

I was raised in a Catholic family, after taking some religion classes, learning about more mystical and existential understandings of religion, and reading people like Kierkegaard, Buber, and Tillich.  Looking at the world in this light gave me a perspective that I hadn’t fathomed before, and, I ended up re-connecting with the faith I had grown up with. 

However, and facing a (perhaps justified) pressure to conform the general patterns of thought in academia, my faith sort of faded out.  I still identified as a Christian, but the central role it played in my understanding of things dissipated.  I began to wonder what the label even meant, and I questioned the intellectual integrity of it.  A few months ago, after seeing Daniel Dennett, one of my personal heroes, I felt like calling myself a theist was no longer intellectually honest.  Identifying as an atheist felt quite strange at first
	
At this point, and I [brought it up here]( http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/1drxva/since_fallibilism_is_standard_in_epistemology_why/).  But repeated fundamental disagreement with virtually *all* (non-academic-philosopher) atheists on issues other than basic empirical and epistemic ones (issues on ontology, existential-type issues, and ethical issues) led me to question this alignment.  My general outlook on the nature of reality, life, and morality, was radically different from any atheists I spoke to, outside of professional philosophers) have been theists (liberal-leaning theists
	
Of course, and ethical matters would alter the justification regarding the way the world *really was* (whether the sort of God that most Christians believed in actually existed).  However, I think that empirical, epistemological, existential, and ethical truths are all connected in justificatory relations.  For example, I think that ethical considerations can feed into the way we understand ourselves, and we cannot easily disassociate the way we understand the world around us from what’s *really out there*.  Alongside pragmatists like Richard Rorty, when he says
&gt;The line between a giraffe and the surrounding air at and the surrounding air is clear enough if you are a human being interested in hunting for meat.  If you are a language-using ant, that line is not so clear, and it is not clear that you would need or have a word for ‘giraffe’ in your language.

I’d extend the pragmatist line of thought that we get (sometimes a bit sloppily) in Rorty to existential and ethical needs,” unlike “giraffe” isn’t simply an empirical concept like “giraffe,” but an existential and ethical one as well, we can see why the analogy isn’t exact, but the same sort of logic carries over.

There’s a lot more I could say (particularly in explaining how the properties of God make sense), and respond to any questions anyone might have.  There are no quick and easy straightforward arguments for God, and I obviously don’t expect to convert any atheists here, but perhaps I might be able give some credence to the idea that some forms of theism aren’t as absurd as it might be thought at face value.  As I said, I generally think convergence in thought (especially on an issue as big as this) is a good thing, and I’m hoping we can find some productive common ground.  

EDIT: Sorry if I'm slow to respond, though I'm trying to elaborate as much as I can, some stuff might come off as fluff.

Furthermore, they wouldn't accept any claims made by non science (psychological, philosophical, etc).  Yes, there were plenty of problems in their theory; but I'm getting there.

So the popular burden of proof argument is as follows; one who theorizes the existence of a god must provide empirical proof for its existence.  The problem behind this is that the existence of such gods cannot be proven by science (despite what some groups might say), subjective subjects.  Religion is in the same category.

Scientific materialism, like madman, are a little too sure of themselves. After all, 
&gt;the madman's explanation of a thing is always complete

Science may be peer reviewed, reaffirming its own method like a student grading his own work. If science is true, it has to be determined externally, not from *within* science. Chesterton needs an exception to justify the rule: a miracle.
&gt; The believers in miracles accept them (rightly or wrongly) because they have evidence for them. The disbelievers in miracles deny them (rightly or wrongly) because they have a doctrine against them.

In science, according to Chesterton. 
&gt; The morbid logician seeks to make everything lucid

The exception is the prime miracle in Christianity: the Resurrection of Christ. The miracle saves science from circularly proving itself and reason from self-destruction.
&gt;Reason is itself a matter of faith. It is an act of faith to assert that our thoughts have any relation to reality at all. […] The young sceptic says, says, ""I have no right to think for myself. I have no right to think at all."" […] There is a thought that stops thought. That is the only thought that ought to be stopped. That is the ultimate evil against which all religious authority was aimed.

According to Chesterton, is deeply flawed and only one religion is more reasonable. 
&gt;*Let the atheists themselves choose a god. They will find only one divinity who ever uttered their isolation; only one religion in which God seemed for an instant to be an atheist.*
 
In fact, atheism leads one to Christianity, but Chesterton is not afraid to acknowledge paradoxes; he loves them. Paradoxes in itself are not wrong, they are no less absurd than reality. So yes, Christianity is a paradox, but a better one than atheism, which is self-defeating.

I originally posted this argument in r/atheism

Here is the argument I presented:

&gt;An interesting thought experiment:

&gt;According to our community FAQ

&gt;    Atheism: the lack of belief in gods.

&gt;In line with our community FAQ

&gt;    Agnosticism is the view that the truth value of certain claims—especially claims about the existence or non-existence of any deity

&gt;Thus

&gt;As such, and gnostic ('strong') atheism. We can also use this distinction to characterize theism as being 'weak' or 'strong'.

&gt;Now here comes the curveball...

&gt;What is the difference between knowledge and belief?

&gt;Well

&gt;Knowledge

&gt;In 1963 Gettier wrote a 3-page bombshell (downloadable at the wiki link) that used two counterexamples showing that a justified true belief (jtb) does not always constitute as knowledge. While these cases may at first seem rather cheesy to the casual observer, but as far as majority consensus goes, have still not managed to encapsulated the concept of knowledge. Thus, the Gettier Problem remains...

&gt;Given the Gettier Problem, one must be able to at least say what knowledge is.

A belief is justified when it is...

- Self-evident (meaning nobody could honestly and rationally contradict it);

- Evident to the senses;

- Incorrigible (in the sense of impossible to dispute

- Specifically uttered by Jesus Christ;

- Or derived by deductive reason from one or more of the above beliefs.


It is important to note that the Bible is not given special treatment here. It is a work of literature and ancient history

As it turns out, but for the purposes of my thought experiment, I'm going to rely on them. (They may not have done the best possible job, but they have surely done a better job than I'm likely to do on my own this evening.)

Since I don't intend to spend weeks on this, these fall into four easily definable groups, as follows:

**Morals**

- Love your enemies; do good to those who hate you.

- If someone slaps you on the right cheek

- If someone takes your shirt

- If anyone forces you to go one mile

- Give to anyone who asks of you

- Give back to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's.

My summary: Do good until it hurts. Then do good some more. This is *not* the Golden Rule or the Wiccan Rede. He doesn't talk about what *you* want at all. You are instructed to maximize the good you do for others

**Beatitudes**

- Blessed are the poor

- Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness

- Blessed are they who mourn

My summary: In each case the normal idea of what comes next is reversed. So in the aggregate

**Parables**

- The parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:30-35)

- The parable of the shrewd manager (Luke 16:1-8a)

- The parable of the vinyard laborers (Matthew 20:1-15)

My summary: Like the beatitudes, which I think is the point. 

**Metaphysics**

- Our father in heaven (""Abba

- The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough.

- The mustard seed (Mark 4:30-32)

My summary: God exists, which nevertheless grows into something greatly powerful. Also, it is in some way mixed into the fabric of the world around us.


Okay

**Question 1: Is it consistent?**

I think the answer is yes. There is nothing in these utterances of Jesus which contradicts physical reality or interferes in any way with scientific materialism. The Beatitudes could possibly be understood as a physical claim of future events, so it's reasonable to suppose that none of the Beatitudes are intended as materialist claims.

I'm not sure if this solves the problem of classical foundationalism being self-refuting. The question is: If beliefs are justified *only* through Jesus Foundationalism, with JF we don't know that it isn't, either. It is possible that JF could be constructed from the *actual* utterances of Jesus, if only we had a record of all of them. You can't *show* JF to be self-refuting, as you can with CF.

**Question 2: Is it Christianity?**

Most elements of modern Christianity are missing. There is no original sin, no requirement to claim salvation in the name of Jesus, no claim that Jesus is the only path to salvation, and no notion that God has a plan for each of us or that God directly or immediately answers prayer. However, it *does* include the idea that God exists, Heaven exists, and that our troubles will be lifted. The parable of the vinyard laborers could also be understood to suggest that every laborer will earn the promised reward, which is similar to the promise of modern Christianity.

**Question 3: Is it moral?**

It lacks many of the moral difficulties of modern fundamentalist/evangelical Christianity. The God of Israelite genocide is entirely absent. The notion that God demands belief and obedience is entirely absent. What is demanded of a Christian is *much more onerous* than any of this: Christians must dedicate themselves *entirely* to doing good for other people. It's hard to see how any claim could be sustained that this is an immoral act. Of course it means that practically nobody calling themselves Christian is actually Christian. But most Christian sects already make this claim

**Question 4: Is it acceptable to skeptics/atheists?**

Skeptics and atheists will of course not believe JF. But followers of modern Christianity are unacceptable to skeptics/atheists not because they believe what they believe

1289149077.0,e2j3t,Calling all evidentialists and empiricists: two challenges,hammiesink,11,6,84,"This is for those who agree with the general empiricist viewpoint

I.e

**Challenge #1**: *Self-refutation*

The proposition is self-refuting. Either it's false

**Challenge #2**: *Relating to the God debate*

An evidentialist objection to the existence of God can be framed like this:

1. Belief in God is rational only if there is sufficient evidence for God's existence
2. There is not sufficient evidence for the existence of God
3. Therefore

But replace God with, that solipsism is false):

1. Belief in the external world is rational only if there is sufficient evidence for the external world
2. There is not sufficient evidence for the external world
3. Therefore

There is no evidence that the external world is real

Or substitute any number of other beliefs you probably hold for which there is no evidence: that Last-Thursdayism is false (Bertrand Russell: ""there is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago, that other people experience consciousness, that the Nazis were morally wrong as opposed to morally right, etc.

The real argument is not that *belief* in God is necessary for objective morality

Objective morality is defined here as a moral value that is true regardless of whether anyone is around to think it true. I.e., even if everyone thought 2+2=5.

It goes something like this:

If naturalism is true, but not *objective.*

But our moral experience does speak to a set of objective morals. We have to stop the Nazis because they are objectively wrong. If morality were relative

We also seem to experience a sense of moral progress throughout history; pedophilia once acceptable in ancient Greece, then we would have a sense that slavery might come back into fashion at some point. But many of us don't feel that way. We feel like we are witnessing the uncovering of a moral ""world"", in the same way we are slowly uncovering the physical world. 

So the two questions are:

1. Is morality objective?

Ok, so I'd like to use a simplified version. Let's look at this simplified and alternate setup for the ""final solution"". Two races of people live together.

A and B both suffer due to this, since A is constantly upset that B exists, and B is harmed by A being upset.

1375683173.0,1jq4un,A good argument for God's existence.,digorykirk,10,24,95,"We observe both mind and mater. (we observe only our own minds

Edit: We should explain one of these things in terms of the other

We do not observe and can not conceive of mind emerging from matter. (I have tried very hard to even understand what that would mean

Edit: No amount of neuroscience can explain what ""I"" am. That is, even if i could do it to myself.)

We can easily conceive of both matter and mind emerging from mind. (I argue that this happens every time we imagine something, fictional characters that we imagine ""take on a life of their own,"" they perceive the world and act in ways that are theirs not ours)

Edit: The above in more detail:

---a simulated mind is a real mind
(if you believe that mind can emerge from mater you ought to be able to grant this)

---minds can simulate other minds and mater
(I can? can't you? every time you make up a fictional charecter

---to a simulated mind simulated mater is real

---thus real mater and real minds can emerge from a mind


Thus it is more reasonable to suppose that we and our world emerged from a Mind than it is to suppose that we (as minds) emerged from the matter of our world.

Anything created by a mind is less real than that mind (a fictional character is less real than the person that is imagining him but far more real than the-charecter-no-one-ever-imagined; the first difference in real-ness is far less significant than the second)

If we and our world emerged from a Mind

Someone more real than us and able to imagine us ought to be called God.

A summery of my argument: a mind can simulate matter and other minds so it makes more sense to explain mater as mind then to explain mind as mater. A mind that is simulating us and our world would be God.

1374263191.0,1inhfn,I posted an essay on religion and have been challenged with debate from believers. Help a friend out?,BORNAGAINSATANIST,19,13,20,"**FOREWARNING- This is long. I will post my essay and the responses that I have received, so don't be afraid to correct me!**   

  
&gt; It’s science and sciencing (I'm coining that!) that got me here, God(s), or personal belief(s) is the one place you don’t go. You just don’t. 

&gt; It is the literal definition of taboo. 

&gt; You can’t question someone’s faith without attacking it. Criticizing the existence of Santa Claus or leprechauns is perfectly acceptable, in my younger years, adamantly defended the Mormon faith from what I perceived as unwarranted, arrogant attacks. I did what I could with what little I thought I knew. It typically and predictably boiled down to the ultimate trump card of ‘faith’ and tuning out that which I did not want to hear or what was too challenging to my comprehension of reality. I was completely unaware that the questions I was deflecting and labeling as disrespectful were the very same questions I would soon be asking myself and those around me. 
            
&gt; Anything that is held close, true or not, are typically part of a larger system of that is directly responsible for those beliefs in the first place- And that system is the practice of religion.  And religious practice, its influence, and its thick blanket of ignorance, continue to thrive, unchallenged and simply ignored as a major player in the every day lives of over half of Americans . Yes, but they are all but drowned out by the enormous outcry on behalf of theists worldwide: 

&gt; “Stone to death those infidels that would dare question our ultimate authority, ""Please don't question my personal beliefs, I'm very sensitive about them.""
            
&gt; Being atheist, it turns out, is not so bad. It comes hand in hand with skepticism, and I have fully embraced it. Although it can be dangerous to be open about it- The opposition is fueled by hate. Hate that is bred from bigotry, bigotry that is birthed from ignorance and ignorance stemming from an alarming lack of critical thinking that can most often be traced directly to a poor education and a history of religious indoctrination.
            
&gt; All my life I've always heard: “Be the change you want to see.”  Well I want to see childhood indoctrination abolished. I want to see children be taught how to think for themselves, it is that very label that puts me at a disadvantage. The religious often fear us, thinking us evil, without morals, and closed minded. Even people that aren't religious frequently have a skewed perception of atheism. So many people have very poor exposure to atheism, resulting from the typical condescending attitude. I was a proponent of this approach for a substantial amount of time, and I wasn't alone. The majority of people see atheists as arrogant, and unwarranted in their anger. Though I ask you, the treatment of women and women’s rights. We see violence every single day that is a direct result of disagreeing about God. Folks will often claim, the root of which all contain something fundamentally wrong and backwards: That faith is a virtue. 

&gt; All children of religious parents are taught this. This is teaching children what to think. It is teaching children to be satisfied with ignorance. I now witness this broadly and first hand. It angers me, and intolerance. Children everywhere, not just in the Bible Belt or Utah, are being blindfolded from infancy. I am writing and arguing on behalf of them. They are too young to know what’s going on. They should not be abused, psychologically, mentally, or physically. They should not be indoctrinated. They should not be subjected to guilt over the vengeful eye of the Lord. They’re children

&gt; Human rights everywhere are infringed upon by religious dogma. Politics should be secular. The laws that affect all of us should be free of any religious influence or interest. They clearly are not. In America, as atheists are literally feared. To be in politics in the united states, you must believe in God.
 
&gt; Education standards need to be raised. Students should be taught to think for themselves and how to think critically. These kinds of classes need to be standard curriculum. Intelligent design and creationism need to be thrown out the window entirely. Sexual education should be a non-issue. 

&gt; All women everywhere should have the exact same rights as men. And if you agree to the extent that yes, it could be a mutual decision between potential parents, but never a religion’s choice (see Texas). 

&gt; Homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. They don’t and there is a movement taking place that isn't fully placing the blame where it should fall: Squarely on the shoulders of any organized religion, and there should be no prejudice for any of the differing attributes we may have. 
            
&gt; And if they want, or anyone else. But as it currently stands, it does affect those incapable of deciding for themselves, as well as the rest of us. If you don't believe me- Well, good. You should research it for yourself. Something a religion would never recommend.

Literally the definition of taboo? Says who? For I believe Truth is God

&gt; But I was the young girl who even at 5 was sent to the ministers chambers for audaciously asking in Sunday school “if God is all forgiving then how can there possibly be unforgivable sins. Needn't all I do is ask?” I regularly set up the juice and cookies and was quickly handed over to my Parents. Now this continued at my best friend’s places of worship

&gt; My spiritualism knows no bounds and I will not constrain myself for another. My Father was a Christian

&gt; I relish the discourse of beliefs for I don’t fear I will be diminished by another’s light. Knowledge only enhances me. Over the years I have selected the bits that speak to the god of my own heart. Trust me I am not the norm as I have ever so many times been reminded. But I still believe Faith is a virtue.

&gt; Now I agree with you that religion is a product of the problem. But not that it is the problem. Hatred, and lies are not born of religious indoctrination. They live within the hearts of men of all faiths and the faithless. 

&gt; Everything you proclaim I also believe in-secular politics, equal rights for the sexes no matter the orientation. However you can’t remove religion from politics without removing man. The very nature of our freedom of speech allows for another to decry the very thing I detest at the top of his lungs. And I don’t argue that children can be indoctrinated but at some point in our lives we must become responsible for who we choose to be beyond our parents, churches, and political leaders. We all have to decide what we are willing to live for, die for and fight for, religious or not.

&gt; For I have stood in the torrent of rage, hung at high noon, dunked and stoned to death, been run over again and again but I can’t be broken for I know who I am. So I would say Faith is indeed a virtue as unique to me as my finger print that emboldens me to rise up in the face of my adversary and cry this is my heart.

&gt; *Ha! We probably had a somewhat similar childhood. At least in regards to being curious kids that asked questions. Where I live now, I am often mocked with verbal sarcasm and nonverbal judgment.*

&gt; (My spiritualism knows no bounds and I will not constrain myself for another. My Father was a Christian

&gt; *I’m sorry, if it were your mother, I would assume that she would be encouraging thinking for yourself and being skeptical. I’m glad that indoctrination was impossible for YOU, but it is a sad reality for countless others. You sound like you had pretty reasonable parents. How many people do you know that have fanatical fundamentalist parents? I know scores of them. Utah is leaking out the sides with kids that would be disowned by their parents for leaving the church.* 

&gt; (I relish the discourse of beliefs for I don’t fear I will be diminished by another’s light. Knowledge only enhances me. Over the years I have selected the bits that speak to the god of my own heart. Trust me I am not the norm as I have ever so many times been reminded. But I still believe Faith is a virtue.)

&gt; *You openly acknowledge that you pick the bits that speak to “god of my own heart”- I’m going to assume you mean knowledge (as you said that knowledge enhances you) and that you pick what bits you find …convenient and feel like they fit into your perception of reality. This brings up a kind of idea that goes like “if I don’t want to believe the sky is blue, tells you to be complacent with not knowing- to just BELIEVE something regardless of the evidence or lack of evidence. That is exactly what faith is- believing in something without having to put any intellectual integrity into it.* 

&gt; (Now I agree with you that religion is a product of the problem. But not that it is the problem. Hatred, and lies are not born of religious indoctrination. They live within the hearts of men of all faiths and the faithless.) 

&gt; *While religion is not the only problem our society and planet faces, we have launched satellites into space, we are exploring our solar system and beyond, we have an understanding of how the universe formed, when it formed, and what is going to happen to it in the future. We have an understanding of how life evolved and what humans are. We have made cell phones and computers and the internet and we have connected the entire planet through the use of social networking. Did religion do any of this? NO! for thousands of years it just proclaimed “GOD DID IT! That’s the END! NOW HAVE FAITH AND BE OBEDIENT!” while skeptics and scientists and free thinkers figured things out in the back ground. We have SCIENCE to thank for almost every single advancement that the human race has seen. And now religions are just doing the same thing still in the face of current evidence to the contrary- I know I am generalizing and lumping all religions together in what I am arguing, but I am only doing it for simplicity and because its largely the truth. You can argue “well my religion doesn’t do that” or “they aren’t a true Christian if they do or say this or that”

&gt; (Everything you proclaim I also believe in-secular politics, equal rights for the sexes no matter the orientation.)

&gt; *good! I’m glad we are in agreement here- these are social issues that are currently hot topics and play an important role in where society will go from here.*

&gt; (However you can’t remove religion from politics without removing man. The very nature of our freedom of speech allows for another to decry the very thing I detest at the top of his lungs. )

&gt; *I’m slightly confused by what you are saying, and instead focus on what the voters want, he would be practicing secularism.*

&gt; (And I don’t argue that children can be indoctrinated but at some point in our lives we must become responsible for who we choose to be beyond our parents, die for and fight for, religious or not.)

&gt; *I absolutely agree with you that we must be responsible for who become as adults and who we choose as our political leaders! We DO have to decide what we are willing to live for, who so often believe it and become that very same thing. It is a sad reality and I hope to see it stopped in my lifetime.*


&gt; (For I have stood in the torrent of rage, hung at high noon, dunked and stoned to death, been run over again and again but I can’t be broken for I know who I am. So I would say Faith is indeed a virtue as unique to me as my finger print that emboldens me to rise up in the face of my adversary and cry this is my heart.)

&gt; *So have we all faced our own adversities and challenges. Such is life. Faith is a virtue only insomuch as trusting the one you love not to hurt you or lie to you. But to question the faith others might have in a mighty god or book? Surely they can handle it if their faith is so powerful- for the questions I ask will only beg them to think critically before they respond.*

&gt; as for women's rights: islam asks women to cover up as a manner of self respect. it regards them very highly and doesn't want any women to be looked at as a piece of meat. to cover up demands self respect from everyone around them. islam also allowed women to buy and own property, but it did introduce to me what being conservative is and really gave me a basis for always keeping it classy. i will never believe that what i do or do not wear influences my ability to have faith.

**Otherguy:** It has falsely been given the honorary title of scientific theory.

**Me:** It has falsely been given the honorary title of scientific theory.

**Otherguy:** Change is not tantamount to universal common descent. You conflate two separate disciplines.

**Me:** Evolution just means change over time, abduction, and the law of parsimony then there should be no problem for you to see that evolution is more likely than anything else to explain the diversity in life. Notice it has nothing to do with abiogenesis, bigbang, etc...

Also

It's simple common sense that DNA related features get passed on during breeding

**Me:** No disrespect intended

**Otherguy:** // Evolution just means change over time
Actually, if you are referring to The Theory of Evolution, it is much more than just change. It is change in allele frequency within a population over generations.

But that ""evolution"" is never observed. It is only speculated because we observe changes in allele frequency that 6 day creationist agree happens. It's called variation

If you're going to try to combat my claims you'll have to do it using accurate definitions. What you did in your statement is known as the logical fallacy of equivocation. You infer two separate issues in the compound claim.

**Otherguy:** //we can see the relation specific species have with each other//
Every 6 day creationist geneticist fully expects to see genetic similarities. It only makes sense that a creator would use what works.

**Otherguy:**  // the separation between old and new versions of the flu is exactly the same kind of separation between ancestor species with modern species but at a smaller scale.//
Excellent choice of example. Just like the flu virus remains a virus

**Otherguy:**  //evolution is more likely than anything else to explain the diversity in life.//
Actually

**Otherguy:** //Notice it has nothing to do with abiogenesis
If you're a naturalist you cannot divorce yourself from either of those two. By necessity the naturalist has to explain how material began to exist and how life began to exist. To claim they are unrelated to evolutionary theory is inconsistent

On the other hand, rather a Scriptural one.

**Otherguy:**  //your claim that it hasn't been tested
Please enlighten me. Please post a link to a peer reviewed paper showing the multiple testing by scientific method that resulted in real time evolution wherein changes in allele frequency crossed familial taxa. Anything short of that and it remains hypothesis because it hasn't fulfilled scientific method.

You challenge me to do ""some research."" That's nothing more than an emotive challenge. I have obviously done far more research than you if you don't understand this very simple principle.

**Otherguy:** //It's simple common sense that DNA related features get passed on during breeding
True. Your extrapolation to the claim that this is somehow proof of universal common descent is what you'll have to provide evidence for.

**Edit: Me:** I wasn't equivocating evolution with the theory of evolution

""Macroevolution"" and ""Microevolution""

Here is some research i was pointed towards: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/?term=evolution

//If you're a naturalist you cannot divorce yourself from either of those two. By necessity the naturalist has to explain how material began to exist and how life began to exist. To claim they are unrelated to evolutionary theory is inconsistent
That is like saying ""You can't explain how the moon got caught in orbit without explaining how the moon got there."" certainly you can. The moon could've been created by some being, just not sound (but non-claims require no soundness). Accepting specific truths about the world around you doesn't prevent you from having differing epistemological points of view.

//Your extrapolation to the claim that this is somehow proof of universal common descent is what you'll have to provide evidence for.//

My point of view comes from a few areas. I could start with the Milgram experiment, and talk about a psychology experiment I was part of in college, a relatively simple one where you just had to write down one thing you would do if you had no chance of getting caught--everyone in a group of 30 except for one or two people would get revenge or commit a crime of some sort. 

Then there's the personal side. I've experienced my share of bullies

There's also the problem that if there is no absolute right or wrong, when it's brought up in an argument that he can rape as many people as he wants to he already does, and that number is zero. Which is fine, I don't think everyone is a rapist, but on the other hand what about the rape case in Stubenville? The boys in that case didn't really have a problem raping a girl, and if any of them have shown remorse or let on in the slightest that their actions were wrong then I have yet to see it. What about the conflicting reports about Bernie Madoff's levels of remorse? 

So, it seems like that empathy can be very easily broken and that a lot of people, upon knowing they've hurt someone rationalize it away or become inspired to do worse. This bothers me a lot. I'd love to see the world the way the atheists I've talked with seem to, but I'm also starting to feel that having faith in humans to do the right thing and not hurt you when it's most convenient is almost naive.

Edit:  I was able to access both studies through ebsco and spent about an hour reading through the articles.  The one from Michelle Trawick just seemed to try and build upon the first study.  I also noticed the sample size of the study was only 120 counties from a single state.  That in no way

Edit 2:  The quality of discussion that ocurrs here is absolutely second to none in my eyes.  It makes me really thankful and appreciative that I have a medium like this from which to learn and challenge my views.

1357922762.0,16dwsl,A Dilemma: Corollary to the Ontological Proof,billsfan13594,19,13,105,"To be brief (and brutally simplify as best I can), God must exist.

However, a finite and flawed creature, cannot claim to know that God does not exist without necessarily contradicting himself.   In other words, Positive or Gnostic Atheism is logically untenable. 

Basically, that is agnostic atheism; we are left with just a belief.  On the other hand, if you claim that God is perfect within our understanding, and we can know whether not he exists, you have just defined God in a way that necessitates his existence.  For, if God is perfect in the way we comprehend perfection, he cannot be flawed in any way.

Now, existing necessarily, if God exists, is more perfect, as we know perfection.

The last paragraph I basically picked up from where Anselm and Alvin Plantinga left off.  If you don’t understand, is that I don’t claim to know anything about God’s existence, but rather, that we can only think about God in a certain way, and that, to claim atheistic knowledge is self defeating due to the limitations of man.

So, then he exists in a way that we know, which contains necessary existence.  If you think of God as beyond something we can fully know, we cannot claim to know his existence, or lack there.

As a note, ask as many questions as you think of.  That way, I can either improve it or disregard and stop wasting my time.  



Edit:  Thanks all for the great responses;	just wanted to clarify that I do not believe the Ontological Argument proves God's existence.

1340935091.0,vrvg1,Empiricism's shortcomings,JerkingCircles,9,5,125,"Hi folks

I find that a large majority of atheists on the /r/atheism subreddit are pure empiricists, observation and experience of the world.  I want to contest this point, and instead argue that empiricism cannot provide justification for all of our correct beliefs.  Now obviously if pure empiricism is best, then that means belief in God is easily dismissable because you don't empirically sense him.  But, if pure empiricism is inadequate, and empiricism is not always needed or sufficient for justification of true beliefs, then it opens up the path to alternate ways of justifying belief in God.  I do want to add as well that I am an atheist, I still recognize the theistic-door-opening potential of this position.

My argument is simply that empiricism requires a logical basis which empiricism  cannot provide to itself.  What I mean by this is that certain rules, and not from experience of the external world.  In order to learn anything from experience (such as that certain rules of logic are justified), I need rules and structures for how to learn from my experiences.  Those rules and that structure obviously cannot come from those experiences - that would be circular.  Instead, it has to come from mental reflection that has no direct bearing on reality or how we experience it.  If math and logic are two things that fall into that category, then perhaps there are other things we can learn that affect the world as we understand it, but aren't subject to empirical testing or examination.

It's my understanding that from an atheistic perspective, we're not more or less valuable than animals since we're all progressions on different evolutionary chains). If this is the case (please let me know if it isn't) why is it that we humans are so unique? For every facet of our human nature

1. We have the capacity for reason which is fulfilled by knowledge (it is fulfilling to our nature to know the truth about reality).
1. We have the capacity for relationships which is fulfilled by harmony within relationships e.g. friendship.
1. We are capable of performing deeds of excellence (e.g. art, poetry, etc) which are fulfilled in skillful performance.
1. We are capable of appreciating beauty
1. We are free and self-determining in that we do not rely purely on instinct - we can go against our 'nature'.

1339740851.0,v31wu,Primate ancestor odds of mutation? Help?,broomroll,6,2,17,"I am in a debate with a friend and he posted these odds for primates to have evolved into humans in 7 million years. What are your guys' thoughts/answers?
**Here is his post:**
&gt;So the changes they observed may just be forms of adaptation that the original organism was already capable of. And that means they may not have anything to do with Darwinian evolution whatsoever, and like I said before I’d like to start focusing on the human evolution statistics, which I will now do. I’ll put some of my equations in these crazy things { }.

&gt;First off, but I keep seeing the statement “96% similar” for modern humans and modern chimps, like at these websites: http://www.genome.gov/15515096; http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/08/0831_050831_chimp_genes.html. For the sake of discussion, I’ll stick with your source. The article you cited says that the change to modern humans would require “thirty-five million single-nucleotide changes, five million insertion/deletion events, and various chromosomal rearrangements.” This is supposed to have happened in a length of 5 million to 7 million years. Let’s just take the 35 million single nucleotide changes and neglect the other required types of mutations. Giving you the full 7 million years, that means 5 correct changes per year {35,000/7,000,000

&gt;Let’s say that the genome of our ancestor had an even three billion base pairs available for mutation, out of 3 billion pairs that can mutate, 35 million of them are changes that will move the species towards modern humans. That means the odds of getting one correct mutation are about 35 million/3 billion, or 7/600. With these odds, it is reasonable to expect that in the first generation, 2(.042) of the 175 mutations that occur will be the “correct” ones {(7/600)*175}. So obviously it’s against the odds to get 75 correct mutations, but just how against? After all, and I’ll try to justify every step I take as well I can.

&gt;So the problem is: if you have 3 billion candidates for mutation (the pairs within the genome), what are the odds of getting 75 correct mutations (the number required per generation by my simple calculations above)? I quickly found myself incapable of calculating such odds, but I asked a more capable friend who pointed me in the direction of the binomial probabilities equation. It is explained (and can be calculated) here: http://vassarstats.net/textbook/ch5apx.html. The equation is used for calculating a probability where a certain number of trials will occur and a certain number of outcomes are required, much like our genetics problem. It works like this:
N = the number of opportunities for event x to occur [in this case
k = the number of times that event x occurs or is stipulated to occur [75 correct mutations need to occur]
p = the probability that event x will occur on any particular occasion [7/600 mutations are correct ones]
q = the probability that event x will not occur on any particular occasion [the opposite of the previous value; 593/600]
The probability of achieving k successes with N trials is calculated as:
[N!/k!(N-k)!]*[p^(k)]*[q^(N-k)]
With our values
[175!/(75!(175-75)!)][(7/600)^(75)][(593/600)^(175-75)]
