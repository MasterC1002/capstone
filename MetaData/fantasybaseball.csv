1365987462.0,1ccxzl,[Discussion]- Some Players that Might Help You - (Original Content),Ezen3000,150,15,53,"Not sure if this type of stuff is allowed her, and if it is positive enough maybe I will try again next week. Hope this helps you out

**1B - [Chris Carter (HOU)](http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/29486/chris-carter)** (11.5 Percent): Based on his career MLB numbers (minus the 2013 campaign), Carter has hit just .214 and slugged .425. While the average has flirted with the [Mendoza Line](http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Mendoza_Line), he has provided plenty of pop - think 2012 Mark Reynolds (.221/.429).

So why add him? He may have finally figured it out. Carter has hit as many as 39 homers in a single season, and slugged .537 during that time. 

Already 1B eligible he is 3 games away from OF eligibility in standard ESPN leagues.

**2B - [Stephen Lombardozzi](http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/31996/stephen-lombardozzi) (WAS)** (0.2 Percent): This is a speculation move

**SS - [Jhonny Peralta (DET)](http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/5527/jhonny-peralta)** (27.5 Percent): A lot of owners are searching the waiver wire for a replacement for the next 1 - 3 months waiting for **[Jose Reyes](http://www.rotoworld.com/player/mlb/3605/jose-reyes)** to come back from his ankle injury. This isn't a sexy acquisition that will win your league for you

Amazingly, hitting 7th in one of, if not the, most potent lineups in baseball. After starting the season 5 for 25, with 1 RBI and 1 run he is 10 for 22 with 5 RBIs, 3 runs, and his first homer of the year. Over that stretch he also included 3 multi hit games!

**3B - [Chris Johnson (ATL)](http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/29616/chris-johnson)** (6.2 Percent): ""The Other Guy in the Upton Deal

With **[Freddie Freeman](http://www.rotoworld.com/player/mlb/4586/freddie-freeman)**on the DL, Freeman's injury has created more ABs than initially speculated for Johnson. So Freeman's return (late April) could put a halt to the constant flow of ABs. Should Johnson continue to hit right handed pitching (.400 on the year and a .286 3 year MLB average), he could force the issue and take more ABs against righties from the lefty, **[Juan Francisco](http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/29601/juan-francisco)** (.321 vs RHP in 2013 &amp; .261 from 2010-2012). 

**OF - [Nate Schierholtz (CHC)](http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/28815/nate-schierholtz)** (5.7 Percent): Schieroltz has been a solid contributor throughout his MLB career, 1 HR, 4 RBIs and 2 Steals. He obviously won't be able to keep the average there but is capable of flirting with .300 and hitting 15-20 HRs and driving in 80 runs, as he is slotted into the 5 spot for the Cubs.

He will continue to see the majority of the starts against right handed pitching for the Cubs, if Hairston (1/10) continues to struggle in 2013. 

**SP - [Tony Cingrani (CIN)](http://firstinning.com/players/Tony-Cingrani-a/)** (0.3 Percent): With **[Johnny Cueto](http://www.rotoworld.com/player/mlb/4660/johnny-cueto)** hitting the DL with a lat strain  Cingrani will earn a call up to the show, allowing 3 hits and walking 5. In his 2012 taste of the majors he appeared 3 times, totaling 5 innings (1 ER, 9 Ks &amp; 2 BB). He will draw the light hitting Marlins on Thursday, against fellow rookie **[Jose Fernandez](http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/32567/jose-fernandez)**.

I would highly recommend the [Fangraphs Library]( http://www.fangraphs.com/library/) if you want to get a better feel for all the stats.

There are still a couple topics that are largely unpolished such as fielding metrics, but data itself is the fruit and vegetables of the baseball food pyramid of understanding. 

Sabermetrics attempts to determine who is getting lucky and unlucky, and how to assign proper value and relevance of all this big bad numbers.

Regression to the mean, LD%, IFFB%, HR/FB, popup rate, z-contact, etc.) will certainly help answer some of those questions while dictating what the future *probably* holds for a player. But the potential is limitless and the true value is that it allows you to sift through the white noise

* *Daily Posts vs. Individual Posts*

I will not be enforcing a change involving the removal of individually posted questions about trades, and fully support them, I still believe that allowing the community to have more focused discussions is important. Upvote good content. Report submissions that don't belong. Individual posts still have value, and can provide some great information if you happen to own a player involved and want to get a sense of people's thoughts on value and projections. 

The one change I *do* support on this topic, standings, roster, etc., is useless to the suibmitter and the community. So I'll be looking to remove posts that lack the basic details necessary, and also removing posts whose headlines don't explain the topic (e.g. ""What do you think about..."", ""Should I do this?""). Include the topic in the headline, and you'll get good feedback and advice. If anyone has a suggestion on a good ""standard"" to use for individual trade &amp; add/drop posts


* *Automation of Daily Threads*

I'd love to have a way to use a bot to automatically post daily trade/start-sit/ROS threads. Currently, and one of the admin, Deimorz, and last I heard there's nothing I can hijack to accomplish this just yet. I believe it can be done, but I don't have the java skills to work on getting a bot to handle something like this personally. If anyone else here does, please feel free to jump in and see what you can do, I think it'd be great to get up and running.

* *CSS Features*

Many subreddits are drowning in fancy CSS features. Some of them are very useful, so I don't see much of it, but I'm familiar enough with CSS to make changes. If anyone has any suggestions for useful CSS they've seen elsewhere, just let me know. I'm in contact with moderators and admins from across the site quite regularly, and would be glad to reach out and see if I can poach some of their tweaks.

* *The Sidebar*

I have no idea how many of you actually use the sidebar here. But I've done my best to keep it concise, who to follow on twitter, links to the best podcasts, etc.). **If anyone has any feedback on restructuring, adding, or clarifying anything there, I'd love to keep that as good a reference as possible.** We have some Sabermetric guys stopping by this week to discuss players and how to use different stats

* *Adding New Moderators*

I've been the lone moderator here for the last four years. I've seen this place grow from 50 users, to the 6500 we have today. Up until this year, there was really no need for any other mods, because there wasn't much to do, other than talk baseball and help each other out. With the community continuing to grow, having one or two more moderators to help out would be damn useful. It's busier, and some of the community is a bit feistier. I'm not looking for an Enforcer, heavy moderation here**

But if anyone would like to volunteer or nominate someone, but mostly I'd prefer to add users who are here consistently, who are level headed, empathetic, and in good standing with the community here.

* *Getting the most out of r/fantasybaseball*

If there are things we'd like to see more of here, demotions, and analysis on players struggles/buy-lows/sell-highs, etc.

I've been very happy with the response from the recent Q&amp;A's we've had running, but I'll be looking to keep those running throughout the season as best I can.

Why should you listen to anything I have to say? Well, and been an expert guest on a national radio program. When I started at FanGraphs, I covered a variety of different fantasy beats, but I’ve since developed the daily Roto Riteup feature, as well as the site’s fantasy valuation system. You can find my assorting ramblings on twitter [@zvsanders] (http://www.twitter.com/zvsanders).

So, how I ended up getting paid to talk baseball, what it likes balancing real-life and internet life, why us writers hate you and your favorite player, or whatever else comes to your mind.

1367448907.0,1dihjd,Signs a trade offer is unfair (towards you),Overlord1317,52,11,29,"The epidemic of horrendously one-sided trade offers in this forum are astounding

Here are some warning signs the trade is unfair:

1.)You didn't put the trade proposal together.  While there are kind souls out there who look at your roster and design their trade around YOUR needs


2.)You are giving up a first or second round pick and not getting a commensurate draft round pick in return.  This year, depending upon league size.  If you are trading a first or second round pick and not getting a pick from the equivalent round back, you're probably getting fucked.  I don't even need to look at the players involved to know that.


3.)You are getting multiple players of ""lower"" value and giving up one or more studs.  Two for one and more commonly three for two trades are often horribly one-sided, at worst, a replacement level player, at best a new prospect or interesting new player.  Roster spots are precious.  You don't want to lock them down unnecessarily.  

One wrinkle that even experienced players don't catch on to is that the shallower the league


4.)Are you trading for a closer?  You are probably getting ripped off.  There are only a handful of closers worth actually trading for


5.)Are you trading someone who is doing poorly (particularly a starting pitcher in April) for someone who is red hot?  Probably a sign you're selling low and buying high.  Where were the players drafted?  I recently saw Alcides Escobar traded for Matt Cain.  What are the chances Alcides Escobar continues on his current torrid pace?  That Matt Cain (historically bad BABIP arguments aside) continues to be absolutely awful? 


6.)Players who are not significantly above replacement level HAVE NO TRADING VALUE.  Zero.  If a guy is marginally better or only arguably better then guys available for free, he might as well not be.  

**all of the above is based, Reyes, or Stanton might/will come back at full health, then who the hell knows.

1371579576.0,1glld6,"[Prospect Watch] Billy Hamilton, Trevor Bauer, Jameson Taillon and AJ Cole",the_clever_cuban,44,27

Bauer has made three starts in the majors this year. He has a 1-2 record with 11Ks and a 2.76 ERA. In the Minors he has pitched 10 games with a 3-2 record with 61Ks and a 3.84 ERA. The numbers look good but Bauer's big problem is his command. He is averaging 4.9BB/9IP which is what he needs to improve on.  The Indians could use the help in their rotation so expect to see Bauer up again in the near future and he could be up for good if he shows signs of improving his command(Last 3 games in the minors he has 8 walks in 17.2 innings so there problem is still looming) On the positive side however Bauer has fantastic stuff.  He has a plus fastball as well as an above average curve ball. He also can throw a slider and a change up but those still need some development and are not on the level of his other pitcher. If Bauer figures out his command he has ace potential but only time will tell if he will. Bauer should be owned in keepers


**Billy Hamilton**

Billy Hamilton is currently in AAA and is hitting .247/.307/.345 with 43 SB.  Hamilton is known as the fastest man in baseball. Last season he stole 155 bases between AA and AAA. The problem with Hamilton as shown by his average


**AJ Cole**

Cole is currently pitching in A ball with a 4-2 record and a 4.16 ERA in 13 games pitched. One very good sign with Cole is that he has a high strike out rate and low walk rate. (He has 82 stoke outs and only 18 walks) The biggest concern with him is that his stuff isn't as commanding as other guys(Like Bauer) He has a plus fastball but lacks a serviceable second pitch which contributes to the fact that opposing hitters have a .261 average against him. He has games where he is masterful(Like his last game, 2 BB and 10Ks) and then he has games where he is very hittable. The Nationals are hoping he is able to develop a second pitch to go along with his fastball and if he does he has the shot at being in the majors late 2014 or at the start of the 2015 season. Unless you are in a deep dynasty league and can afford to use a spot I would leave him as a FA and add him to your watch list to see if he can figure out a second pitch.


**Jameson Taillon**

 With the recent call up of Gerrit Cole Taillon is the best pitching prospect in the Pirates system. He was scratched from his most recent start but is listed as Day to Day so it is unknown at this time how serious the injury is. This year in 13 starts he holds a 3-5 record with a 2.89 ERA. He also has 77 Ks and 27 BB. Taillon has a Plus fastball as well as an above average curve and change up. If he can improve his command a bit he has the potential to be the #2 guy in Pittsburgh behind Gerrit Cole. While Taillons stuff isn't as good as Coles it is close and they should figure to be one of the best 1-2 punches in the league. Unless there are some more major injuries to the Pirates rotation don't expect to see Taillon in the majors this year but he could make a push to be in the rotation to start next season. With that he should be owned in dynasties and deep keepers but unless he gets promoted to AAA I don't think he will be able to contribute this year.

See the actual article [HERE](http://www.sonsofroto.com/articles/baseball/fantasy-baseball-2013-value-picks.html) if you'd like, and invited me to the fantasy football conference in AC last August..so that is good enough for me)

***Value Picks Within Yahoo! Top 150***

* **Evan Longoria** (19) - Pretty black and white situation here. Longo is a perennial first round pick whose propensity for getting injured has dragged down his ADP. I’m not telling you he will stay healthy this year
I prefer him over an equally as injury prone Troy Tulowitzki and over Giancarlo Stanton and Adrian Beltre as well. Stantbeast is, but the phenom won’t steal bases and the rest of the Marlins won’t be creating many runs, so I will be passing on the price tag for an outfielder. But I digress, buying Longoria is like going all in with a Royal Flush draw on the river. 
 
* **Jose Reyes** (30) - My boy Jose is one year removed from a batting title, which goes to show he is a natural with a bat in his hands (and is primed to put up massive stats).
 
* **Allen Craig** (53) - The stars have aligned and Craig is ready to bust out, Allen is fertile and fucking ready to put it all together. He will provide a pimp .300-plus batting average, 28-plus bomb potential, and run production that comes with hitting in the heart of an always imposing St. Louis lineup. 
 
* ~~**Chase Headley** (64) - Before you go any further, I do believe a drop in home runs is coming, but doomsday prophecies are overblown. While the strikeouts are a bit heavy, he also draws a ton of walks and it feels like he finally got comfy in the big show. Would I reach? Not really. But if he falls in your lap, lick your chops and fearlessly draft the man.~~ Broken thumb, gotta assume the worst and stay away unless he falls sueeper deep and you can pop him in a dl slot. Own him on two teams already but will be avoiding Chase the rest of the draft season.
 
* **Aaron Hill** (67) - For those of you living under a rock, average, and run production with solid peripherals, I am a believer especially with the Diamondbacks offense on the rise. Love him in the low-to-mid 60s this year.
 
* **Freddie Freeman** (73) - The injured left index finger that slowed him down the end of last season is supposedly healthy, and I’m a big fan of Freeman as a value pick. I do like Goldy, but he is everyone's sleeper pick. Would rather get Freeman, Ike Davis, or Mark Trumbo later on. Shit, even Paul Konerko is a great buy at his ADP.
 
* **Austin Jackson** (91) - Coming in to his fourth season in the bigs, saw a boost in power, and finally crossed that .300 threshold in batting average. If he swipes more bags, as Leyland is hoping for, Jackson could turn into a top 75 player with ease. 
 
* **Mark Trumbo** (135) - You will not get Trumbo this late unless you are drafting against a bunch of scrubs. He is a lock for 30-plus bombs as he enters his prime years. Underrated power bat
 
* **Carlos Santana** (79) - I have been a Santana fan ever since he entered the league. With a substantially improved Cleveland offense, especially in OBP leagues. I am a sucker for solid BB/K ratios and all the hype over the years wasn’t a bunch of hoopla. 
 
* **Ike Davis** (107) - Dude started off ice cold in 2012 but still ended up with 32 bops. He is a steal at the price although he has gone somewhat earlier in most drafts I have done so far. Nothing else to say here. Just cop an easy 30-plus home runs and thank me later. 
 
* **David Freese** (113) - Assuming the bruised ass bone is not a big deal
 
* **Carl Crawford** (116) - He's a huge question mark as he is dealing with nerve irritation steming from the Tommy John surgery. If he can eventually brush it off and get healthy, he is only 31, and he is still an incredible natural athlete. Carl took live batting practice for the first time recently, but should still start the season off on the DL.  
 
* **Dan Uggla** (125) - Regression. Sometimes it burns you trying to chase the dragon, but he is built like an ox and I am willing to bet that those HR/FB rates will grow once again. Considering the imposing lineup in Atlanta, Uggla could put up monster numbers if he transforms back into the streaky, but dominant, Danny boy we know and love.
 
* **Salvador Perez** (130) - Still a baby, and Lorenzo Cain might even stay healthy. Perez has the skills to be a steady .300 hitter, and is an elite buy in keeper/dynasty leagues considering the success he had at the not so ripe age of 22. 
 
* **Ben Revere** (144) - The Phillies made one of the most underrated moves in the offseason with Revere. He is a young speedster with a very solid glove. While most people warn you against paying for steals
 
* **Alejandro De Aza** (140) - Slurped De Aza last year, but I respect the man’s game and he is peaking at a plump 28 years old as well.
 
**Value Picks Outside Yahoo! Top 150**

* **Wil Middlebrooks** (155) - Another popular sleeper pick this season, then gobble the youngster up. Safe option? Not particularly, especially since the recent wrist injury is a bit unsettling. He mashed in his first trip to the show, but the sample size is too tiny to really get all worked up. Solid risk/reward buy.
 
* **Jonathan Lucroy** (170) - I fucking lust over Johny Loocs. In a season where it seems like there are countless catchers on the rise, but Lucroy in the mid-to-late rounds is a gem. Expect well-rounded stat production.
 
* **Lorenzo Cain** (192) - Zo is the definition of injury prone, but if he can put together a full season, 20 bombs and 30 swipes is doable. 
 
* **Justin Morneau** (198) - Recently got J-Mo for $11 in a 20-man auction league and people were ragging on me. Apparently, plan on having Morneau as your starting first basemen.
 
* **Everth Cabrera** (205) - Yes the potential PED suspension is a bit worrisome, Mike Trout, and Michael Bourn. 
 
* **Brandon Belt** (239) - Who are we to shun this man for not living up to his hype when he is still only 24 and has not been given a true full season of opportunity? He has power and speed and is locked in as the starting first baseman for the Giants. The stars may finally be aligning
 
* **Andrelton Simmons** (240) - The buzz is out there, but if you are deep in a draft and still missing a SS, then he is a godsend.
 
* **Starling Marte** (253) - Speaking of young stud muffins, I envision an exciting 15/30 campaign and the Pirates are excited to see what he can do as well.
 
* **Colby Rasmus** (260) - I have always been a sucker for sleepers after the buzz dies down. Rasmus had countless fans, as he has shown absolutely no comfort or power at the plate since returning from a shoulder injury. With Anthony Gose an Rajai Davis waiting for a shot, Rasmus could miss out on an incredible opportunity if he doesn’t pull his shit together. Monitor the situation, but I still think Rasmus is a smart buy late in the draft. You need a couple roster spots open for streaming/waiver pickups anyway, so if he turns out to be a bust, it won’t kill you. 
 
* **Domonic Brown** (322) - Let’s keep going down the rabbit hole. Dom Brown is making a case for more plate appearances this spring and could be a solid contributor in deeper leagues if given a shot (even after Delmon Young returns). His batting average will burn a bit
 
* **Nolan Reimold** (324) - Another injury prone dude who never put up the numbers people expected, and Wilson Betemit is penciled in as the DH. But if Nolan can stay healthy and swing a heavy oak, then he could surprise us this upcoming season. Granted it was only 16 games, but he absolutely dominated before getting hurt last year. 
 
* **Jon Jay** (331) - JJ could be my favorite late-round draft pick of the year. He is not flashy by any means, and stole a decent hunk of bags last season. Jay will most likely leadoff for the Cards and is the perfect late-round glue guy for those needing some outfield depth.   
 
* **Mitch Moreland** (532) - So let me get this straight. Moreland is a 27-year-old coming into his fourth year in the bigs, but isn’t getting much love. Me likey. 

*And was edited out of the article for some reason

* **Justin Smoak** (768) – The Smoak monster is going undrafted in a large majority of leagues (and he should be left as waiver wire fodder in most) but could be a great pick in very deep leagues. He swings a heavy lumber and could be surprisingly productive if he retains the starting gig at first. He is a shittier Adam Dunn who will hurt your average

1372775699.0,1hhyf7,[Prospect Watch],the_clever_cuban,37,4,35,"**Nick Castellanos**

Castellanos is the top prospect int he Tigers system and will most likely be called up soon. He currently is in AAA and hitting .303 with 11 HRs and 42 RBIs. His defense will be average at best but he has the potential to be a plus plus hitter with above average power which is very valuable in Fantasy. The Tigers don't have huge need offensively at the moment but adding another quality bat to the lineup is always something they will do if possible. I would expect him to be up in the next couple of weeks and will immediately get a lot of at bats. While he won't bat high in the order(doesn't have much speed) he still will have a chance to score some runs

**Byron Buxton**

Buxton is making a great case to be the top prospect in all of baseball next year. He recently was promoted to High A and between A and High A he has a .340 average with 8 HRs 58 RBIs and 33 SB. He and Miguel Sano give the Twins some hope for the future because of the talent they have coming up in the future. Buxton has legitimate 5 tool ability and could be a game changer. While it is still very early in his career and development if he keeps hitting the ball like he has been he will be very hard to ignore. He still has probably one to two more years before he reaches the majors but he has a shot at making it to AA by the end of the year if he keeps this up. He should be owned in al dynasties and is worth a look in keepers but has no value in re-draft leagues.

**Javier Baez**

Baez is the top prospect in the Cubs farm system right now. He is currenty in High A and is hitting .272 with 17 HRs 57 RBIs and 9 SB. His main asset is his power which has plus potential. He will never hit for a fantastic average but his power ability makes up for some of that. The Cubs are in an interesting situation to see what they end up doing with Baez because they already have Castro at short. Baez also has been pretty terrible on the defensive side of the ball so that may also add to why they are taking their time with Baez. Wherever Baez ends up hitting or playing he will be a strong power hitter who can really help you team. He won't be up this year and will possibly make a push at some point next year so he should be owned in keepers and dynasties but has no value in re-draft leagues.

**Jonathan Singleton**

Singleton is the top prospect in the Astros system and is also the top 1B prospect right now. He started off the year suspended but is now in AAA. On the season he is hitting .263 with 6 HRs and 17 RBIs. The average has yet to show up but he has shown his good power potential. He has the ability to be an above average hitter as well as have above average power which should be valuable in fantasy. There have been some rumors about him coming up this year but only time will tell since the Astros can take their sweet time with prospects since they do not have the need to compete right now. He is worth a look in all leagues and should be owned in keepers/dynasties without a doubt. 

**Robert Stephenson**

Stephenson is currently in A ball with a 2.97 ERA to go along with 85 K's and only 17 BB. He has a plus plus fastball as well as an above average curve and an average changeup. There were concerns about his control coming into the year but he seems to have answered those questions. I expect to see a promotion to High A soon but he is still a ways away from the majors. He is worth a look in dynasties and keepers depending on how deep rosters are but he still has a lot of development left in him. He should be the top prospect in the Reds system next year since Hamilton will most likely be up at some point this year.

If you have any requests for players for me to do next week just let me know! Guys I have previously covered are Xander Bogaerts, Archie Bradley, Miguel Sano, Billy Hamilton, Trevor Bauer, Jameson Taillon and AJ Cole.

Clearly the new season is almost upon us

   
**Posting Rules** - These rules are in place to benefit both you and the community as a whole


**1 - No memes.**         
Memes can be hilarious from time to time, and results in relevant submissions by other users to be overlooked. There are perfectly acceptable reasons to post an image link, such as sharing league controversy, trade offers, trophies, rosters, etc., posting a link to your roster and asking how your draft went or what changes you should make is not the most useful way to get feedback(discussed further down). But if we find that these posts lead to negative/off-topic discussion they may be removed and potentially elimated. Please see the examples below:        


**2 - Trolling

We're all here to learn, and obviously there will be arguments, but it's all in good fun. There is no need for any kind of personal attack, and there's absolutely no place for deliberately giving another member of the community bad advice. Bad advice happens, I told several of you last year I thought Tommy Hanson was a reasonably good pitcher, but for whatever reason I actually believed it at the time.

If you see bad advice

Personal attacks will be removed

**3 - No inane/off-topic posts.**            
We don't generally care how awesome you think your 4-team mixed roster is

**4 - Do not post links to your personal blogs**               
I know this subreddit has a lot of users who create their own content. Some of it is fantastic. Some of it is really not(*no offense*). If your only contribution to this forum is posting your own blog links, and you post your blog every week, they'll be removed. There are too many to allow them all. If you have a personal blog that is regularly updated with original, useful content, 'message the mods' and I'll consider adding you to the sidebar.

**5- Do not post premium content**

This goes two ways. Posting a link to an article that requires a paid membership doesn't help most of us, such as ESPN Insider articles or Rotowire Blogs, is copyright infringement. As useful as it might be to share something you have access to, this isn't the place for that. Any such content will be removed.


**If you do not see your post in the /New queue, and I'd be happy to approve it for you.
____________________________________________________________             

        
**Posting Guidelines** - These are not rules. These are some basic suggestions to help you get the best advice possible


**1 - *Please* post your league's format and details.** 

Without knowing how many teams are in your league, Roto/H2H/Points, auction/snake/keeper/dynasty, AL/NL/Mixed, and anything else that affects how we'd be valuing players for you, there is *absolutely no way* for us to tell you which side wins a trade, how well your draft went, or anything else. You'll just end up having to explain all of these things in the comments anyway

**2 - Please use the following tags** to help clarify what you're asking.       

* Who Should I Keep? - Use tag [KEEP] before title of post. Explain any penalties or costs involved(how many can you keep

&gt;ex: [KEEP] Need to pick five

* Review this trade - use tag [Trade] before title of post. Also clearly state give/get in title.        

&gt;ex: [Trade] Give Mike Carp / Get Mike Trout             

* Who do I start? - use tag [WDIS] before title of post. Post names of players being considered in title.         

&gt;ex: [WDIS] Ben Revere / Lorenzo Cain              

* Add/Drop - use tag [FA] before title of post. Say who you are thinking of picking up and dropping in the title.           

&gt;ex: [FA] Should I drop Alex Rodriguez for Alex Gonzalez?            


* Open Leagues - use tag [OL] before title of post. Say how many spots are available in your league

&gt;ex: [OL] 2 Spots in 12 Team Dynasty Roto

 * Will help in return - This is something I've seen on other forums that I've always liked. When you submit a question, and rewards us for providing good info when we have our own questions as well.

&gt;ex: [Trade] Give Verlander / Get Garza and Butler [WHIR]

**3 - Be thoughtful when replying.** Explain yourself, so we can learn, or so we can point out how wrong you are.

**4 - Use the search box.** Many questions have already been discussed many times, how vetoes are bullshit, etc.). It's always good to revisit these once in awhile for fresh discussion, but many times there are already some good answers out there for you.

**5 - Help make this place better.** This subreddit has come a long ways in recent years, good info, and providing good informed discussion, this forum can be incredibly useful to all of us. 

* Please report violations

* Don't downvote opinions you disagree with. *Upvote them*, inappropriate, or off-topic submissions or comments.

* If someone already answered what you were going to answer

* If you have suggestions for things to add to the sidebar, use the 'message the mods' link in the sidebar and I'd be glad to discuss, my only goal is to make this place a clean, organized, powerful tool to help every one of us dominate the season.

http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/x3s9a/is_there_an_official_reddit_fantasy_baseball/

Well apparently /r/redditdynasty is taking things to another level with a super deep 30 team keeper

As I mentioned before, is going super strong with hundreds of teams registered for this upcoming season. The league has grown exponentially over the past couple years since it was created and I hope that we can achieve equal success.

So it has begun! But we need to discuss/vote/etc on a couple things before moving forward. A lot depends on how many people sign up for the first year and whatnot but we might as well all be on the same page and let the discussion floweth. To make a long story short,2, or 3 teams move up and down divisions each season so the most talented managers move up the totem pole 

We can't have keepers with this format (in theory we should be able to have enough teams to have multiple divisions and relegation so people will be switching leagues every year)

We can't decide on the number of teams (even though it will most likely be 12

1. H2H

2. 5x5
Hitters - Runs, SBs/NetSbs, K's, Average, OBP/OPS
Pitchers - Wins, Saves, ERA, WHIP, QS
Or the different tiers/divisions can use different settings. The higher the division the more stat categories.

3. Snake or Auction draft - I am 100% in love with auctions. You are given more freedom in regards to crafting your team. I'm also just one man.

4. Host? The Narffl is hosted through FLeaflicker. Apparantly they worked out some deal with them. I can contact the commishes and see exactly why they chose fleaflicker if we are interested. Personally I vote Yahoo...It is the most used and we can see each others yahoo fantasy sports profiles.

So voice your opinions below

And good luck making your playoff push


**EDIT 1**: Ah I love it. So roto it is. Year one we can just have as many 12 team roto leagues as we can fill up and than split everyone up into divisions come year 2. (probably stick to snake 5x5 year 1)It seems like people are down with the basic concept KTrout mentioned:

""A - Snake draft, top four teams are promoted end of year to AA
AA - Auction h2h 6x6 non-keeper
AAA - Auction h2h 6x6 keeper league

Only thing I suggest is not having keepers in the top tier so that everyone has an equal chance from day one. 

That blueprint can be stretched and altered when/if more people get involved as well. Also, the categories and draft types for the upper divisions, and how to approach an expanding league.

I was bored today, you win $5.6 million.



So here's my math:

We'll assume that the average batter picked is going to be a .350 hitter in his match-up (this average is probably generous to start with). This means that he will have a 35% chance of getting a hit in each at bat. We'll also assume that a player will get an average of 4 at bats per game.



First

**0.650 x 0.650 x 0.650 x 0.650 = 0.1785 (17.85%)**



Subtracting this from 100% will give the odds that a player gets at least 1 hit and keeps the streak alive:

**1.000 - 0.1785 = 0.8215 (82.15%)**



So there is an 82.15% chance that a player will get a hit in his game. Multiplying this by itself 57 times gives the chance that a player will get a hit in 57 straight games and ""Beat the Streak"":

**0.8215^57 = 0.00001357 (0.001357%)**



So if your picks hit .350 and get 4 at bats per game



**TL;DR** There's a 0.001357% chance of Beating the Streak.

Note: I wrote this kind of like a fantasy baseball article

Through today, he's hitting .296. Is it an anomaly though? Well, yes, but it is sustainable? Possibly. He won't hit .296 all season, but I think he can be more than just a one trick pony this year.

His BABIP so far is .308, what gives?  

Well, which is under his career average of 32.3%. It's also worth noting that his SO% last year was also under his career average at 29.6%. For a guy that (I believe) once set the record for strikeouts in a single season, this a great step forward. But why isn't he striking out as much?

You might say he has refined his mindset at the plate a bit; I can't verify that, it was a little more than 2% down from the previous year, and it's been up and down like that for his entire career, so it's is definitely not something worth over analyzing. 

The interesting stat is his O-Contact%. It's 60.3%. His career average is 45.9%, but he actually gotten *better at hitting bad balls*. 

Is a 60.3% O-Contact% sustainable? Probably not. Is a .308 BABIP sustainable? Ehh, but as I pointed out, he's been trending upward over some years. He's off to a hot start, but I'm willing to bet this isn't *just* a hot start.

* AA - 6x6, top 2-4 promoted
* AAA - 6x6, top 2-3 promoted
* Majors - 7x7

* Don't drop anyone you used a decent draft pick on until mid-June.  It's a long season

* Start your stars regardless of their matchup.  They're stars for a reason.
 
* For any trade you will have to give something to get something; don't ever expect to throw out crap and get anything but crap back.

* If at any point you can say  Player X^i &gt; Player Y^i for all players i in a trade and you are receiving the X-package  then you do this trade.  This is clearly only valid for *n*-for-*n* trades.

* When evaluating a trade

* Beware hot players who have never shown consistent success in the pros.

* Prospect upside is fairly meaningless unless you are in a keeper league.  Pro baseball is tough to adjust to - a player's 2^nd or 3^rd year in the pros is often better than their first - if you're in a keeper league

* Beware the hot spring training player.

* Veterans who do it every year are better picks than any player who has never done it.

* Don't fall in love with and overvalue your players.  You will lose out on good trades by valuing your players too highly.

A quick disclaimer: This post is long

If you would like to skip the text and jump right into the spreadsheet

https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3UnZmeMA4wPMVJyMnhoUkNCMFE/edit

On to the wall of text!

The Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------
For those unfamiliar, TEs lower etc. Value based drafting, depending on the method, will tell you how many more points a player is expected to score than the next guy at his position, or a typical player at his position. Basically, VBD is a way of quantitatively adjusting for positional scarcity.

Now, Matthew Berry's latest fantasy baseball podcast on ESPN discusses how much of a bump Buster Posey gets for being a C vs. his value as purely a first baseman. They essentially settled on 1-2 rounds ""feeling"" right. It's easy to see why this is. In standard H2H or roto leagues, there are 5 categories for hitters, and 5 for pitchers. In comparison, in fantasy football it's much easier to compare between positions because all production goes into the same category: points. In baseball, the same analysis will get you +/- in 5 different categories; comparing apples to oranges.

The Methodology
-------------------------------------------------------------------

With all that in mind, I took a somewhat WAR-like approach. I took ESPN's projections and put them into a spreadsheet, sorted with an overall ranking, as well as positional rankings. Using this, I calculated the average of the 2*X number of players at each position, where X is the minimum number of starters at that position in my league. This creates a baseline ""replacement level"" player to compare to. Next, each player has a score calculated for each category: R, RBI

Each player then has a total ""player value"" calculated as the sum of his contribution above the replacement level at his position in each category. This leads to players having very different scores depending on where you play them. For example, 71.9 RBI, 2.65 SB and a 0.344 OBP vs. a ""replacement 1B"" averages of 80.87/27.43/92.03/4.3/0.360.

Where I need help
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's where you come in Reddit. I'm not a stats major, most of my methodology basically can be summed up as ""tinker with it till it looks right"". I'm looking for any pointers on where I can improve my calculations. Specifically, I'm considering taking just the average of the X number of players around the minimum players started. I feel that top  catchers have been unnecessarily boosted by being compared to guys that will not see a draft board in anything less than a 15 team league. You'll also note that in the methodology segment, I did not mention how I calculated pitcher values. This is because despite using a similar system, I have no idea how to value each category in order to get an accurate comparison across pitchers and hitters. The link to my spreadsheet is given at the top of this post, as well as again below.

1371912692.0,1guvey,[Keeper League] The case for O. Arcia,SonnySideUp,30,6,31,"I am just floored by the lack of coverage for a 22 year old kid doing what he's doing against major league pitching with a minor league track record like his.  I'm here to change this.

O. Arcia: 267/333/466 in 144 PA; 198 ISO, 348 wOBA  

I ran a simple search on Fangraphs for every 22 year old with a qualifying season since 1990.  

Players with an ISO at or around .200 in their age 22 season:  

J. Heyward (210)  
B.J. Upton (209)  
Andruw Jones (208)  
A. Dunn (206)  
F. Freeman (196)  
G. Sizemore (195)  
W. Cordero (195)  
R. Zimmerman (191)  
I. Rodriguez (190)  

Players with a wOBA around 350 in their age 22 season:  

R. Furcal (355)  
Derek Jeter (354)  
P. Fielder (354)  
J. Heyward (351)  
J. Upton (349)  
J. Olerud (349)  
N. Markakis (345)  
G. Jefferies (345)  

Players with a bb% at or near 7.6% in their age 22 season:

N. Markakis (7.9)  
I. Rodriguez (7.7)  
S. Burroughs (7.6)  
R. Alomar (7.4)  
G. Sizemore (7.4)  
D. Jeter (7.3)  
C. Baerga (7.3)  
O. Infante (7.2)  
H. Blalock (7.2)  

Other than Burroughs, but of course it's not all unicorns and rainbows.  He has a 26.4% K% rate.  The relevant age 22 comps:

T. Fryman (24.3)  
A. Dunn (25.1)  
J. Upton (26.6)  
B.J. Upton (28.1)  
B. Gil (32.4)  

Other than Gil and Fryman, I can't help but be excited by some of the above comps.  The closest since 1990 seem to be G. Sizemore and J. Heyward.  He obviously has less speed than these guys, and probably less projectability than Heyward, but the results are similar.  So here are the guys with the best comps (including two bonus notables from history).  All have OK but not great walk rates, poor strikeout rates, and very good power.  All 4 have (or will, in the case of Heyward) turned out great.

Reggie Jackson, 8.1% BB%, 27.9% K%, 250/316/452  
J. Heyward, 8.9% BB%, 23.3% K%, 269/335/479  
Juan Gonzalez, 5.5% BB%, 22.6% K%, 260/304/529  
G. Sizemore, 7.4% BB%, 18.7% K%, 289/348/484

If he ends up anywhere near these guys in production

Well

**Year 1 - upcoming 2013 season**

Unlimited 12 man standard 5x5 Roto leagues - While H2H is generally favored

1500 Innings Pitched limit

Runs, Steals, Batting Average

ERA, Ks, Saves

**Year 2 and beyond**

After year 1 managers will be appointed to one of the various divisions based on their performance (the exact breakdown will 100% depend on the number of managers in year 1

* Majors - 7x7 - league champions are exempt from relegation next season
* AAA - 6x6	
* AA - 5x5
* A - 5x5 - Rotisserie

We will hammer down specific settings, the # of leagues will decrease. (I understand that this is a very loose description, but we will stay organized and as the league reaches mass proportions we will eventually settle on a specific # of leagues in each division.)

New members will be placed into leagues in A which will always be rotisserie (gotta earn your stripes and it is a more accurate tell of a better team than playoff performance alone)

Unless people are terribly against it

AAA will add OBP and Quality Starts and will be H2H

Majors will change steals to net steals, Quality Starts, and Holds. Will also probably be an auction draft...big boy league for sure. 

As I said before, and settings will be decided upon in the future (not vital until year 2)

One of the things I dislike about NarFFL is the difficulty of moving up divisions (and there are only 2 divisions) so there will be a constant shift every year based on performance (nothing too crazy but instead of having the winners of leagues in the alt division compete in a playoff challenge and only a portion of them moving up to the premier league, it will probably be 2-3 teams per league promoted and demoted)

***Thoughts, and that decisions have to be made with the fact that there will be hundred(s) of teams***

So...pardon my language

Enough business though...We need to decide upon a league name (and eventually division names in the future) so that we can make a sub specifically for this league and everything can be much more organized. See below for some ideas. Brainstorm and chat it up (whatever league name we go with either has to be simple enough that we can make an easy to remember sub name or can be shortened to do so)

Sonny Gray will be the next guy added to the Athletics rotation once a spot becomes available. He is currently in AAA with a 8-5 record

**Anthony Ranaudo**

23

Ranaudo was once a top prospect in the Sox system but had some injury problems and a couple of down years but has re-asserted himself as a top option for the Red Sox rotation in the future. He is currently in Double A and has a 2.67 ERA over 16 starts(8-2 record) to go along with 94Ks and 34 BB. Like Gray he has an above average Fastball and Curveball plus an average changeup. However

**Gary Sanchez**

20

Sancehz and Miguel Sano were the two big names signed out of the Dominican Republic in 2009. While Sano is considered the better prospect

**George Springer**

23

Springer is considered the #3 prospect in the Astros system but he is having an amazing season. He started off the year in AA and has since made the Jump to AA on the season he holds a .307 average with 23 HRs

1372187544.0,1h20x9,"[Prospect Watch] Miguel Sano, Noah Syndergard, Archie Bradley and Oscar Taveras",the_clever_cuban,28,28

Sano was recently promoted to AA after starting off the season hitting .330 with 16 HRs and 48 RBIs in High A. Through 8 games in AA he is hitting .150 with 2 HR and 8 RBIs. While the average has not come along yet he has walked 7 times and is showing his power is for real. Sano was signed out of the dominican republic by the twins and is arguably the best power hitter in the minors right now. Sano should be an a guy who hits for a decent average bur great power in the big leagues. He originally was a SS but due to some growth (Listed as 6'3 195) was moved to third and his defense is coming along there. Sano is drawing some comparisons to Miguel Cabrea but he currently does not have the plate discipline or contact ability to be a guy who can hit for top average and power. The Twins are historically slow with their prospects but we could see Sano up in September if he gets on a hot streak. The realistic thing however is Sano finishing off the year in AA and then making the team out of spring training(Similar to what Aaron Hicks did for the Twins this year) Sano should be owned in all deep keepers/Dynasties and if you have an extra bench spot there is a slight chance he could provide some help by the time September rolls around.

**Noah Syndergard**

Now that Wheeler has gotten the call up Syndergard is the top Pitching prospect in the Mets system. He started the season in High A with a 3-3 Record

**Archie Bradley**

Coming into the season people knew Archie Bradley had ace stuff

**Oscar Taveras**

Taveras is without a doubt the best hitting prospect in baseball right now. He was slowed down by a sprained ankle but since then has come back and appeared to pick up where he left off but appears to have re-injured his ankle. Through 43 games Taveras is hitting .294 with 5 HRs

- [D3](http://d3js.org/) (for visualizations)
- [DropWizard](http://dropwizard.codahale.com/) (for easy packaging)
- [JPA/Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org/)

- Whatever else might be useful.
- Let me know if you'd like to contribute and we can chat. I'm pretty totalitarian with me code

**TL;DR** - I want to make a website that can analyze your league and provide you some analytics about the league itself

Edit: Added some technology links for giggles.

Edit 2: Based on some of this feedback, and fantasy providers. This means I've got to re-organize the design a bit. Thus, a lot of the code on GitHub right now will probably be chucked (except the DOM parsing). I'll try to make it generic enough to support expansion in the future. Still, my primary focus will be *my* use case for now (H2H points ESPN).

1330835270.0,qgscf,Fantasy Baseball as a constrained optimization problem?,cw87,23,0,18,"Crossposted from r/askreddit:

I’ve been toying with an interesting(to me) problem and thought I’d put it out there to see if anybody had any thoughts. I’m into fantasy sports and with the baseball season coming up

Specifically, 3 Bench, +1 DL)

Batters (13): C, 3B, SS, OF, OF, OF, OF, 2B/SS
Pitchers (9): P, P, P, P, P, P, P
Bench (3): BE
Disabled List (1): DL

With this in mind, it’s better to win each category marginally than it is to win one category in a landslide. So I began by working with just the hitters for the sake of simplicity. Pitchers complicate things because they should be subdivided into starting and relief pitchers. Additionally, I only looked at the top 170 hitters and the top 130 pitchers because in a 10 team league the maximal amount of hitters that can be taken would be 10 * (13 + 3 Bench + 1 DL).

From there, but the thought occurred to me that some stats are highly correlated with others. For example, home runs are going to be highly correlated with runs batted in. I then ran the correlation on each pair of stats and found:

Correlation coefficient for Stolen Bases and Home Runs: -0.378145898254

Correlation coefficient for Stolen Bases and Runs: 0.407344916712

Correlation coefficient for Stolen Bases and RBI: -0.391241974411

Correlation coefficient for Stolen Bases and AVG: -0.0357487109075

Correlation coefficient for Home Runs and Runs: 0.400202256444

Correlation coefficient for Home Runs and RBI: 0.855432710116

Correlation coefficient for Home Runs and AVG: 0.112844039465

Correlation coefficient for Runs and RBI: 0.456866404969

Correlation coefficient for Runs and AVG: 0.330686850925

Correlation coefficient for RBI and AVG: 0.382051876962

We see a few expected correlations: SB is negatively correlated with HR and RBI, HR and AVG don’t seem to be highly correlated. There is some logic to this: home run hitters will frequently swing a great deal and as a result will have higher strikeout rates and correspondingly lower batting averages. Obviously this isn’t always the case as some like Pujols have extremely high batting averages and HR counts.

What’s interesting about this is it made me realize that my method for identifying multi-stat contributors is going to be affected by certain correlations or lack thereof. So by picking up a power hitter

What I’m wondering is how exactly can I formulate this as a constraint problem to maximize multi-stat contribution while rewarding players who contribute in categories that statistically are not expected. I’m thinking that the way to approach this is to look at rather than the total differences from the means,y)) that would reward negatively correlated pairs of stat categories and discount highly correlated positive pairs. Additionally, to take it a step further, it would be useful to take into account positional scarcity. In other words, reward players with the best multi-stat contributions and also play at positions where value is scarce or where the position itself is scarce. One good example would be catchers: there’s a smaller amount of players who play catcher as opposed to outfielders. This should probably be done with the concept of replacement players(VORP) but I’ve yet to tackle this issue. I’d love to hear any ideas that anybody has regarding the whole thing.

TLDR: I'm looking to formulate fantasy baseball as a mathematical optimization problem that rewards the best multi-stat players and particularly those who contribute to unexpected stats,False,self,t5_2quxe,True,,,t3_qgscf

I have been a Fantasy Baseball writer for half a decade

My focus is on starting pitching - but I follow every part of the game.  I have been writing my [Pitcher Profiles](http://razzball.com/category/pitcher-profiles/) the past 2 years where I break down starters pitch-by-pitch in a game for a more introspective breakdown into their numbers for that start.  I've also developed my own statistic called [Gamescore+](http://razzball.com/a-new-razzball-exclusive-stat-gamescore/) to attempt and put a numerical value on my breakdowns.

If you're in a 14 or 16 team league

What you have here is a guy who in 2012 slashed 262/356/431 in AA and followed that up with a 328/380/588 in AAA (granted, and won he 2b job.  

In 160 at bats, has slashed 269/331/421.  ZIPS predicts a slight downgrade in all three stats for the rest of the season, but I think there is some reason to disagree:

(1) He's just getting used to the league.  Over the last 30 days, actually.

(2) He is a line drive machine.  Over 160 at bats, and Joe Mauer is at 30.6%.  I'm not saying Jedd Gyorko is Joey Votto incarnate with 2b/3b eligibility, but that's good stuff!

(3) He has a 324 BABIP

(4) He has an excellent eye. To wit, but it's impressive for a 24 year old rookie.  Other guys in his range: Brett Gardner, Jon Jay, Adrian Gonzalez, Allen Craig.  He has an 8.1% bb%, and this is in line with his walk rates throughout the minors (7.8% - 12.2%).  Since this is a skill that typically improves with age/experience -- or at least doesn't decline sharply -- we can classify this as a strength.  He can get on base.

(5) He can hit for power.  What I love about his batted ball profile, and a very impressive 34.2% FB rate.  Those flyballs are what homeruns are made of.  I don't have access to his FB+HR distance charts (does anyone?), but 10.4% of his flyballs have become homeruns.  Just glancing at his texas leaguers spray chart, at least one of those was some 20 feet behind the outfield wall, so we know he CAN smash (in case the 260 ISO in AAA last season wasn't sufficient evidence).  Rough back of the napkin calculations: assuming 600 at bats, 33% of which are flyballs, that's 200 FBs.  10% of those are HRs . . . that's 20 dingers from your 2b, and a 330/340 OBP.

(6) Position flexibility.  He's 3b/2b eligible this season.  8 more starts at 3b

This season?  He's OK.  Next season,False,self,t5_2quxe,False,,,t3_1ekv22

* He has somehow managed a .355 OBP
* He has 53 runs scored which is still on pace for over 100. 
* His BABIP which is at .303
* Hes making contact on pitches inside the strike zone at a 75% rate

While his heavily increased walk-rate is largely responsible for his rather high .OBP, and his contact rate on strikes bound to go up; if you combine those two increases with the fact he's swinging at a lot more strikes already, his production is going to increase favorably. 

I fully expect him to hit .290 with almost a .400 OBP rest of the way. I don't expect his walk rate to dip

So rest of the way I think he hits around .290, 40 BB, 50 R, 60 Ks. In a 10 team H2H points league Im going to try to buy low, what do others think of Upton ROS? Am I right, wrong, etc?",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/1hr3hd/justin_upton/

1374587001.0,1ivt3u,"[Prospect Watch] Christian Yelich, Mike Foltynewicz, Garin Cecchini and Taijuan Walker",the_clever_cuban,18,14

21

While Yelich has had a bit of a down season(per his standards) he still is considered one of the best prospects in the minors. He was just called up but was hitting .275 with 9 HRs and 33RBIs on the season Yelich is considered the top prospect in the Marlins system and had it not been for injury he probably would have been called up instead of Marcel Ozuna earlier in the year. He projects to be an above average hitter both in terms of contact and power which makes him a potential valuable fantasy asset.  There are rumors that he could be un any week now so he is definitely worth a look especially if you could use some OF help.

**Mike Foltynewicz**

21

Coming into the season Foltynewicz was considered the 3rd best pitching prospect in the Astros system but with his performance this year he may make a push to move up in the pecking order(Probably just behind Appel since Cosart is already up) On the season he has a 3.06 ERA through 15 starts and has 98 Ks as well as 48 walks. He has a plus fastball to go along with an average curveball and changeup. He projects to be a #3 or #4 starter but with a fastball as good as his he could end up being a serviceable fantasy pitcher. He shouldn’t be up this year so he is really only worth a look in deep keeper leagues/dynasties.

**Garin Cecchini**

22

Cecchini has burst onto the scene with some great preformances across two levels this year. Coming into the season he was ranked the 8th best prospect in the Red Sox System but by the end of the season may even be the top prospect in the system(If Bogaerts and Bradley Jr get the call up) In High A and AA he has a statline of .344 with 7 HRs and 45 RBIs. He also has 60 BB in comparison to 58 Ks giving him an OBP of .455. He projects to be an above average hitter with average power. He also though has some speed and should be able to steal 15-20 bases in the big leagues which adds some value to him. The only question is what the Red Sox will end up doing with him. For the 3B and SS position the Red Sox currently have Will Middlebrooks who is a hot streak away from owning 3rd again, if not the top prospects in the game and Cecchini so what they end up doing in their infield will be interesting to see. He probably won’t be up this year and really is only worth a look in dynasties and keepers.

**Taijuan Walker**

20

Walker is considered the top pitching prospects in baseball by many scouts. He has had an absolutely amazing season with a 2.14 ERA with 117 Ks and only 37 walks. He is currently in AAA and while the Mariners aren’t in much position to be in contention come October he easily could be up come September

**Xander Bogaerts**

Current Level AAA

Statline this season (AA and AAA)- .311 AVG 40 R 6 HR 35 RBI 35 BB .407 OBP .502 SLG .909 OPS

Bogaerts was recenly promoted to AAA after a fantastic start in AA. He is once again hittong for a solid average and has started to show development of his power stroke. He still is striking in 23% of AB which is higher than the team would like but he also has 35 walks this season which is a good sign that he is developing a better eye as well as showing some patience at the plate. If he can lower the Ks and continue to hit well he has a shot at reaching the big leagues as a September call up as a best case scenario. He should be owned in all Dynasty leagues as well as potentially in deep keepers and projects to be either a SS or 3B(if he gets to big for the position) who can hit for solid power and average.

It was all ESPN standard points scoring at first, basically just making it so the top pitcher and top batter (projected) would score the same amount by the end of the year. I was pissed about this and made a deal about it but nothing really changed, but I didn't push the issue.

The other issue is that, but the LM didn't want to do that because he didn't want to risk having pitchers that start a bunch of games or something. I told him to just set it a little higher but apparently that wasn't good enough. He said he might change the acquisition limit (which I specifically told him I did NOT agree with, it was at 5 per week as is). Nothing was said afterwards.

This week I ran into an issue. I had two players go to the DL and two more players who I just wanted to get rid of, I realized that the LM had set an acquisition limit of THREE for the week. So I complained and the answer I got was ""Aren't you the one who didn't want people to stream pitchers?"".

Cincy called up SS prospect **Zack Cozart** today. 25 years old, and 9 SB. Paul Janish was sent down to make room for him. All Cozart has in terms of competition is Edgar Renteria, hitting .227 with 1 homer and 13 RBI, so it looks like Cozart will get a bulk of the playing time, with a very good vet to back him up and mentor him. He had a single and a run scored tonight in his debut, but also ground into a double play and was 0-2 with RISP. Dusty Baker did pinch hit for him in the eighth, and let Renteria finish the game

Next, 1 out of every 1000!), he's been hitting .288 with 25 Runs scored 5 HR, 23 RBI and 6 SB. He's been hot lately too, hitting .361 over his last 15 games. Yes, he's batting at the bottom of the order, and yes there are better hitting outfielders out there, there's value in a guy who's on pace for double digit HR's and Steals, all he's got is Willie Bloomquist spelling him now and then against lefties.

Finally, and won 8 games out of only 15 pitched in 2008 because of an ankle injury he sustained while running the bases in interleague play, Wang pretty much shit the bed in 2009 for the Yankees, was demoted to AAA, put on the DL for shoulder issues, and then never seen again. Where's he been since then? Rehabbing his shoulder in the Nationals' system. He's just started taking the mound again, and he looks good. On June 27 he went 3 innings, and walked none in A-ball. Pitching for High-A on July 2, allowed 2 hits, but that might be as soon as the end of July. And when the Nats wake up and realize this is not their year

I vetoed the trade. The two guys making the trade made a bit of a stink and proposed a new trade (Verlander and Arencibia for Addison Reed and Brian McCann). The guy trading Verlander away has fairly decent pitching and claims he needs closers. There are guys like Rafael Betancourt, Steve Cishek, and Oliver Perez/Yoervis Medina available on the free agent market.

So this was something I did last year that seemed to work to great success albeit with something of an imperfect formula. 

**The idea of this being to post some trades that have been going through in your league and I will update the OP to reflect the trades posted in this thread.** I will use my own judgement on what I believe to be Sell Highs/Buy lows/even deals etc...Hopefully this can give some insight for owners into what has been working in other leagues and may just work in their own.

A couple of rules here

* Post plausible trades only. We Don't care to hear about the trade rape you pulled off

* Please don't post 3 for 3s or 4 for 3s etc... Simplistic

I will hopefully do this about 3 or 4 times throughout the season.

So get posting and hopefully we can help out our fellow redditors on the the trade market!

**Buy Lows**

-*Cliff Lee and Tim Lincecum for Matt Kemp* (If Lincecum performs then even but Kemp a good buy low candidate)

-*Evan Gattis (sell high) and Annibal Sanchez (also could be a sell high) +6th for Matt Cain and 4th*

-*Chris Davis and Matt Holliday for Matt Kemp and Adam Dunn* (Though this may work out even)

-*Felix Hernandez for Matt Kemp*

**Sell Highs**

**Even Swaps**

-*Will Myers and Nelson Cruz for Max Scherzer (May be a bit clearer when Myers is up)*

-*Chris Davis and Huroki Kuroda for Chris Sale (Possible sell high on Davis here)*

-*Dexter Fowler for Austin Jackson*

-*Adam Dunn and Wade Miley for Roy Halladay and Pedro Alvarez*

-*Yovanni Gallard for Pablo Sandoval*

1363847061.0,1apwj2,Value Based Drafting in Fantasy Baseball:Redux,V1etnan,15,1,7,"Hey all

A couple weeks ago I submitted a post discussing the validity of value based drafting in fantasy baseball. In case you missed it

I got a lot of great feedback, this made the hitter to pitcher comparisons make much more sense, especially with regards to the ratios. Big shoutout to u/Unreliable_Source for that one. 
Additionally, the main point of value based drafting is to compare across positions, and the format of fangraphs projections does not include positions. Unfortunately, I haven't had the time recently to manually enter the positions for each player, so for now at least, I'm stuck with ESPN projections, sorry! (thought I did change certain prospects projections such as Wil Myers

I also added sections for MI and CI just for u/shmael

Just kidding

Also added is a column including Yahoo's default rankings

Finally

Spreadsheet can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3UnZmeMA4wPd25oSTF1Mm1veUU/edit?usp=sharing)

Now, it's been a couple weeks and you're telling me that all you've done is incorporate standard deviation and add Yahoo ranks? Well no, not quite. I also created this handy dandy [team stats spreadsheet!](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3UnZmeMA4wPREZYa3hsSklMNXM/edit?usp=sharing)

The idea here is that you can copy and paste over players as they are drafted from one spreadsheet to the other

Well, thanks again for the great ideas, they'll definitely be incorporated next year. Good luck and happy drafting!

Edit: 1B rankings were screwed up. Fixed it! If you bookmarked the old link please use the new one unless you want to have terrible first basemen!

Edit Again: Takeaways! For those of you who can't be bothered to look at all the tiny numbers. Pitchers to come later.

Takeaways: 

C:
Catcher is top-loaded, you could pick up either player in the 5th or 6th round and feel pretty good about the value. Matt Wieters is criminally under ranked by Yahoo (99th overall) and if you can’t grab Carlos Santana in the 5th or 6th then Wieters in the 8th is a great alternative. Mike Napoli is the biggest wild card in the position, as depending on whether or not you think he’ll bounce back he’s either top 5 or at the bottom of the top 10. I tend to think that Boston and a healthy dose of DHing will be good for him, so I tend to agree with ESPN’s optimistic projections, which makes him a huge steal that can be had after pick 100 in both ESPN and Yahoo leagues. The biggest over ranking at the position is Yadier Molina, whose numbers simply don’t hold up to scrutiny as the 49th player off the board to ESPN. He’s much more reasonably ranked by ESPN at 90. Overall, I would strongly recommend grabbing Santana or Wieters if possible, just make sure you grab one of the top 8 catchers unless you want to bet on Jonathan Lucroy or Wilin Rosario exceeding their projections by a good amount.

1B:
First base is the strongest position in fantasy baseball many years, which is part of the reason why Albert Pujols is over ranked by experts. His numbers are still elite, but without approaching the mammoth numbers he was putting up in his prime he won’t be able to justify a top 10 pick. On the other hand, Prince Fielder and Joey Votto very well might. There’s not a lot of surplus value to be had at the top of the draft simply because of how surplus value works (if your first rounder performs like a first rounder you broke even) but Prince Fielder should be the first 1B off the board in OBP leagues but is ranked third on both Yahoo and ESPN. Use that as you will. As for the rest of the field, there aren’t really many players ranked too low. In fact, as a general rule, the rest of the field of 1B is generally slightly over ranked by ESPN and Yahoo, where both players already have huge jumps forward built into their rankings. Avoid these players at 42 and 64 respectively as they need substantial leaps forward just to break even.

2B:
Second Base, however, the next two players at the position, Dustin Pedroia and Ben Zobrist, are not. Dustin Pedroia should be the fourth 2nd baseman taken in OBP leagues, and Ben Zobrist gets a big boost from replacing AVG with OBP. I would be more than comfortable taking Zobrist with a 4th rounder, a round or two above his rankings at ESPN and Yahoo. The combination of his value relative to his position and his dual eligibility at both MI positions makes him a target in every draft for me. Possibly the best value at the position is Dan Uggla, but OBP is actually about average at his position, he’ll still deliver plenty of surplus value even at that spot.

SS:
Shortstop is the other weak position in the draft. Like Second Base, especially with Hanley Ramirez’s sheath injury should be Ben Zobrist. Jose Reyes appears to be overrated, unless he can get back to his 50+ SB days, his value in OBP leagues is minimized a bit due to his AVG being a more positive contribution than his OBP. Starlin Castro, while solid, also is not worth his 3rd or 4th round price tag. Overall, if I Troy Tulowitzki and Ben Zobrist are off the board, depending on the results of Hanley’s MRI
Edit: Hanley out two months

3B:
Third Base is a misleading position. The average third baseman is actually the second most productive average player behind only first base. However, is head and shoulders above the rest of the position. However, unlike Second Base and Shortstop, this isn’t a function of nobody else at the position delivering strong value. In fact, Evan Longoria and David Wright should both be in consideration in the second and third round range. Adrian Beltre is apparently allergic to walks, and so loses much of his value in OBP leagues. I would strongly avoid drafting him in the second round where both ESPN and Yahoo have him ranked. With the injuries to Chase Headley and Hanley Ramirez, and Hanley’s much greater value at SS anyways, the aforementioned top four

OF:
Outfield is deep every year, you may find yourself in the Mark Trumbo, Chris Davis range where you simply don’t want to be. At the top of the draft, you’re not getting Ryan Braun or Mike Trout unless you’re drafting in the top 3, and for good reason. However, you can get big value from Jose Bautista in the second (he should be a first rounder). Andrew McCutchen and Matt Kemp are both well worth their first round tags as well. In fact, outside of Carlos Gonzalez maybe being a teensy bit overvalued as a first rounder when he belongs in the second, who should both be considered in the early 3rd, as his strong OBP numbers play very well in that format. Austin Jackson is another guy to target as I would be comfortable taking him in the late 4th early 5th and his ranking is in the 6th round on ESPN and the 8th on Yahoo.

[Click here to check it out on Google Docs.](http://goo.gl/evQ3K)

I don't like relying on just one cheat sheet from one site, which is essential in an auction draft where things move pretty quickly and there isn't a lot of time to think about your next move.

Here are the main columns with explanations in parentheses:

* Player
* Team
* Pos (Position)
* Alt (2nd position for players with multiple eligibility)
* Alt (3rd position for players with multiple eligibility)
* Actual (column for recording the actual value as the draft goes on)
* Avg (average value from all 8 sites)
* FP High (FantasyPros averaged 5 sites &amp; listed the high and low values across those 5 sites along with the average. I thought this was useful since each draft goes a little differently and it helps give an idea of a maximum budget)
* FP Low (see ""FP High"" above)
* SLP (players listed as sleepers or undervalued
* BST (players listed as busts or overvalued
* PTS (I categorized each statistic in 4 tiers - green = 2 pts, red = -1 pt. This is a bit arbitrary but it helped sort of give an idea of each player's overall projected statistical value)
* Columns M-V (Average projected statistics across all 4 websites that listed them. If a website didn't have a player I entered a value of ""$0."" I also assigned color value, .275-.285 are yellow, and under .260 is red. You can figure out the values for each stat pretty quickly and change it for yourself.)

I hand-entered all of this so of course there's potential for an error here and there. I also went off of the list of players from the first site I checked, Eric Thames, Bryan LaHair, Zach Britton, and Brad Peacock aren't listed. Some of these guys have some sleeper potential in a deep league but I didn't add them to my list since I don't think they're relevant for my draft.

There are 3 total tabs. The 2nd tab is a place where you can paste the row for each player you draft. It also calculates how much money you have left in the draft and your projected team statistics (it does in Excel anyway...I'm hoping that logic got carried over when I uploaded it to Google Docs). I entered statistics goals as well based on the average top score in each category for my league for each of the last 4 years. The 3rd tab just lists the websites I used for the auction values.

If you have any comments or questions

I also recommend going through and highlighting players with green

Good luck!

EDIT: This is based on a standard 23-player team with 9 position players (1 at each position and a UTIL) and a $260 salary cap.

First I will discuss notable recent call-ups, and may even be worthy as keepers in some leagues. In Seattle, we have first baseman **Mike Carp**, a former Mets prospect who was acquired via the J.J Putz deal in 2008. 25 years old, Carp was hitting .343/.411/.649 with 21 HR and 64 RBI at AAA over 251 ABs. He'll be eligible at first base right away, but his playing time this year will mostly be left field. And with only Greg Halman (exactly, who?) there, he'll get his chance to prove he belongs. 

Next we have **Jose Altuve**, and uninspiring names like Matt Downs and Angel Sanchez as his competition, it looks like Houston is going give Altuve some playing time just what to see how he'll respond. Common sense says he can take the job and run with it if he impresses early on. Over 352 AB's in A+ and AA, Altuve hit .389/.426/.591 with 10 HR, 59 RBI, and 24 stolen bases. Yes, those stats look nice

Now I'll be talking about guys who either have been rostered all year, J.D. Drew sucks and is expendable trade bait. And I don't mean to knock on Darnell McDonald, he can be an occasional spark plug, but right now he's a pinch runner and defensive replacement. So who's the *real* 3rd man in the outfield? Reddick. He can play all 3 OF positions and absolutely took over in Carl Crawford's absence, hitting .365 with 4 HR and 14 RBI in just 63 AB's. Yes, Terry Francona is gonna trot Drew out there (for now), and yes, but all that means is that you might be able to wiggle him away from an inattentive owner if he's not on the wire.

So you need some cheap power, first base, and DH. Since being traded to the Dodgers on the 12th, Rivera's started 5 out of the last 6 games. He's not going to give you the best average, but you know he's gonna get his HR's and RBI's. He hit 6 HR and 28 RBI in a sporadic 251 AB's with Toronto. Currently on pace for 12 and 48, I think those numbers go up substantially with regular playing time, especially when the Dodgers decide to become sellers.

Finally let's talk some pitchers. First of all, **Javy Guerra** of the Dodgers is going fast. It looks like **Jason Isringhausen** is getting first dibs for saves in NY with K-Rod gone, but if he goes too, then the job is **Bobby Parnell's** to lose. But those pitchers' ownerships have been skyrocketing, so I won't be talking further about them. 

I'm getting a little tired, **Tyler Clippard** is owned too. Everyone else is probably available, and they're all worthy of a roster spot in a deep league. Like I mentioned last week, **Tom Gorzelanny** and **Jason Marquis** will be shipped to contenders when the Nats start selling, and the values of these vets may go up when it happens. Marquis is 8-4 with a 3.92 ERA. He's not a strikeout pitcher at all, but will be an innings eater and has the ability to consistently string together quality starts. Gorzelanny will most likely go to someone's bullpen as a long reliever, getting an occasional hold and a spot start here and there. **John Lannan** and **Livan Hernandez** will probably stay in Washington, but if you need some back of the rotation type pitchers

Other notable pitchers: **Charlie Morton** of Pittsburgh, 4 ER, 4K effort), and Arizona's **Joe Saunders** 3-1 2.25 ERA over the last month.

A few months ago, I'm mostly sticking to that for now. Additionally, it's just something I'm doing in my spare time, so there have been weeks where I've done absolutely nothing.

Anyway, shape, or form and (potentially) visualize it using a graphing tool called D3. The data scraping is done, and I've begun the query/manipulation aspect of it.

So far, you have bad luck.

Since this is done

Using [my league](http://games.espn.go.com/flb/leagueoffice?leagueId=49723&amp;seasonId=2013) as an example

1. The Masterbatters: 15.719

8. Из России С Любовью: -14.852 
9. Bobby Coxsters: -15.260

We have days where not a single probable starter is available for pickup. Everyone is asking for good pitchers in trades for position players and no-one is giving them up.

Since 4 of my 5 first picks in the draft were pitchers I'm fine with the pitching shortage and I picked Corbin up off waivers too. He seems like the perfect sell high candidate with a 6-0 record and 1.52 ERA. Most of what I'm hearing is that he's due to correct to around a 3 ERA from now due to an unsustainable LOB% and today's start kind of showed that he’s been lucky with a lot of double plays and line drives straight to infielders getting him out of jams while walking 5 batters in 7IP.

A guy in my league is desperate for pitching offered Sandoval up for a good SP which no-one took. I already own Miggy at 3B so I'm fine in that position but I thought about seeing if he would take Corbin and trade Sandoval for a position I need more. I'm thinking about seeing if he would take it. Corbin is my highest scoring player so I'm reluctant to let him go

Hamilton stole 103 bases last season, and he is the fastest player in baseball.  But, more importantly, he has developed an ability to get on base, and it isn't entirely a california league mirage.  

Billy has started walking at a very solid clip for a young leadoff hitter type, and still has a chance at sticking at SS.  This would be a fantasy stud.

He is not major league ready, it is worth considering adding him now.  He may not be a sexy name like Bryce Harper, but if he sticks at short stop his fantasy value will not be too much lower.

I like the color coding because it makes it easier for me to notice potential runs on a given position and some better value in picks.

* I have 5 keepers. Should I keep Jurickson Profar? **What the hell?** You have 5 keepers. The point of a keeper is to get the highest value pick to keep into the next year. If you do it right you should end up with 5 1st-3rd rounders

* Who's the next Mike Trout? **NOBODY** No one has EVER put up a season like Mike Trout before. Nobody will ever come close to it. There's a reason he is the #1-#3 overall pick. Because he is a one in a million player. The production he put up is the most outstanding rookie year when put up against the MLB averages that season.

* Should I draft (prospect here) in the 1st round of my keeper league **NO** If you have a small group of keepers

1338570810.0,ufuzc,Farming the Wire (Part 2) - Justin Smoak,DocEllis,20,7,17,"Justin Smoak is probably the most highly touted of the three players I am featuring in this segment.  Colby Rasmus certainly got his fair share of attention but it was Smoak about whom USA Today wrote


Most scouts viewed Smoak as a player who could switch hit for both power and average from both sides of the plate while also offering plus defensive tools.  The Rangers were high on the young slugger


While Smoak did show some positive signs, who were making a serious run at a championship, beat out the Yankees for the best pitcher on the market, Cliff Lee, in a deal that saw Smoak shipped off to Seattle.


While the return Texas got for Smoak speaks highly of his potential, to SafeCo which is well known as a pitchers haven, seemed to further dim his once bright future.


With that said Smoak still found himself with an organization committed to him in both the short term and the future.  Often times a change of scenery is exactly what a player needs to kick start things and Seattle must have hoped this would be the case.  Yet we know now this was not so


He finished the 2010 season


Over 100 games and 348 at bats Smoak posted a :


       .218/.307/.371 AVG/OBP/SLG with 13 HR's


One of the most troubling aspects of Smoak's debut was the spike in his K% which rose to 22.9% after sitting close to 15% through his minor league career with Texas.  This was certainly troubling but of course some regression in performance is expected when transitioning to the major leagues. There were some positive signs, despite the rough rookie campaign.


Unfortunately for the Mariners, but that still left him sitting between a notorious underachiever in James Loney with 103 wRC+ and Brandon Belt who posted 98 wRC+ in just 187 AB's during his rookie debut.


When all was said and done his sophomore totals looked like this.


                        .234/.323/.396 AVG/OBP/SLG with 15 HR's


After two seasons of mostly miserable results


His ownership was actually at 55% of CBS leagues entering the year signaling that not all owners had forgotten about this once future star.  But an ugly start to the year


It is funny how it works though, a man who appeared to be more bark than bite, began to simply devour opposing pitchers.  To be clear he is merely crushing the baseball, not practicing cannibalism, though that would probably warrant a post in and of itself.


Over the last two weeks Smoak's ownership has jumped back up to 50% as he has posted an impressive line of :


                  .313/.365/.646 AVG/OBP/SLG,  5 HR's  and he even managed 1 SB

Given the small sample size it is too early to declare a breakout but this is certainly an exciting turn of events.  Never before has Smoak put it together quite like this


                     ------------------------------Going Forward--------------------------------


In terms of projections going forward one must factor in many things but the reality is that there is going to be a lot of uncertainty.  The updated ZIPS projections off the FanGraphs site has Smoak down for


                                          .231/.303/.385 with 20 HR's and a .302 wOB


These numbers however don't really tell the whole story since projection systems are not designed to incorporate the signs of a breakout


Personally I would be shocked if Smoak did not top 20 HR's and I see 30+ HR potential as soon as this year.  The power seems like the safest bet in terms of Smoak's skill set, so it seems realizing the 30+ HR potential that scouts once raved about, seems well within reach.  In fact, if you prorate out Smoak's last two weeks, he would easily break 60 HR's over a full season.  So even if he cools off (which he inevitably will) Smoak can still be highly productive.   


Smoak's average on the other hand is a little more dicey compared to his power.  While he won't maintain the .313 AVG from the last two weeks it is fair to think he is better than the low .200 hitter he was over the last two years.  Smoak was able to put up solid AVG's in the minors including hitting .328 for the Rangers AA club in 2009 over 227 plate appearances, and consider anything beyond that, just gravy.  With that said I think Smoak has the potential to produce considerably more than a .260 AVG in part due to his sparkling pedigree and his project .300 ability as a prospect.


In terms of playing time, especially given this hot streak.  His home park, as said before, is not going to help his numbers and the splits would agree as  he has hit for a .188 AVG at home compared to .257 on the road. However I tend to think park factors can be a bit overrated when you are talking about someone with Smoak's raw power.  It may prove beneficial to bench Smoak on the road but if he is hot I don't see any reason why he wouldn't be worth starting at home as well.

-------------------Bottom Line--------------------

After two disappointing seasons Smoak looks primed for the breakout Mariners brass must have imagined when parting ways with Cliff Lee.  While his two week torrid stretch is a small sample it should be more than enough for a speculative pickup.  If Smoak gets ice cold you can always drop him with very little lost

Expect his AVG to be a slight drain, even playing half his games in SafeCo, and 30 or so HR's, while optimistic, is hardly a stretch.  Playing every day and hitting cleanup for a improving Mariners lineup should afford Smoak a good deal of RBI's, albeit with slightly less runs.  The splits suggest he could be a good home/road platoon candidate but he should be a viable start both places when hot.

Some owners might opt to wait and see but that could very well leave you, cruelly leaving Smoak to fade into fantasy oblivion, there is enough evidence to suggest that this is could be a sign of things to come.

The time to buy is now.

**EDIT**

The upcoming series vs the White Sox should be interesting

An interesting footnote is that Smoak's first Home Run was against Gavin Floyd

Cobb threw a 55-pitch simulated game on Tuesday (7/30) of last week. Yesterday evening (8/3)

Cobb reportedly looked good as he went 4 innings

The current plan is for Cobb to start once more in the minors and then return to the Rays' rotation assuming no set backs. That would mean Cobb is likely to start in the minors again on August 9 before possibly returning to the Rays around August 14 or 15.  

Cobb is currently only owned in 70% of Yahoo leagues and 53% of ESPN leagues. With a 3.01 ERA (3.52 FIP, and 8.2 K/9 on the season, not to mention playing for a hot Rays team that has been winning lately, adding a guy like Cobb for the stretch could be a significant addition to many fantasy teams. I know many people here have stashed him, but he's obviously still available in 30%-47% of leagues, so I thought this PSA could be of use to some people here.

When requesting trade advice

* League Format: Roto/H2H/Pts
* League Type: Redraft/Keeper/Dynasty
* Keeper Considerations: Cost or penalty for keeping the players involved
* Relevant Roster Information for both parties: Who are you replacing, can they afford what you're asking?
* Team Standings and Concerns: Are you leading, or gaining ground? Did your only speed guy just hit the DL?

Remember, the better the advice you'll get in return. So please avoid vague questions. If you want to know what Player X is worth, find the one or two teams in your league that need him the most, and share with us some players on their roster you are interested in.

Stanton - I believe he is the toughest call out of all this. I feel he is a lock for 35+HR's

Heyward - The ceiling on this guy could be as high as McCutchen or Carlos Gonzalez. He had a great 2012

The battle for me comes down to Bautista or Heyward. This will be my first year in a keeper league and I am leaning towards Heyward because of age. 

What say we FantasyBaseball Community?

EDIT: (Here is the tally after getting your guys feedback

Bautista - |||||||

Giancarlo -||||||||||||

Heyward - ||

Here is the tally. I think I will be going with Stanton if I still have the opportunity to grab him. I am 2nd pick overall, (and I agree), Stanton is an absolute monster, hes younger, hes better for a keeper league, and his value could shoot up to top 5 if he gets traded to a playoff contending team.

1338499281.0,ueijm,Farming the Wire: The Alex Gordon Example,DocEllis,12,3,21,"Nothing hurts more, affording you the opportunity to fill holes in your roster or grant you the flexibility needed to make trades that improve your team.

Usually they take the form of highly touted prospects who failed to realize their potential over numerous seasons. While many of these players will never fully realize their original projections

One player that fits this mold perfectly was Alex Gordon and his breakout performance last year. The player who many were calling the next George Brett struggled to live up to expectations. Over his first four years in the league 2007-2010 Gordon posted WAR totals (Wins Above Replacement) of 2.1

This troublesome downward trend was supported by the fact that his highest wRC+ (weighted Runs Created) came in his sophmore year at only 106.  To give a reference point to what the organization may have expected, a disappointment.

This all lead to the once future star dropping off the fantasy radar in 2011, many owners were able to land him off the waiver wire.  The owners who did (and the Royals for that matter) found themselves handsomely rewarded to the tune of a 6.9 WAR season.  That total easily bested the total of WAR amassed over the previous four seasons (4.7 cumulative WAR 2007-'10).

The hits just kept dropping all season long

I point out Alex Gordon in an attempt to illustrate the value of being open to players who still have upside despite failing, instead you want to target players on the cusp of having that magical year.

Over the coming days I will spotlight a number of former top prospects who appear primed for the kind of breakout year that Gordon enjoyed last year.

                          -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The players highlighted in coming articles are:

Colby Rasmus - CF Toronto Blue Jays

While his year to date totals may not seem impressive you shouldn't let the numbers deceive you

Justin Smoak - 1B Seattle Mariners

Much like Rasmus Smoak's overall numbers are not all that great though his 2 HR's and 6 RBI's, Smoak has been red hot the last two weeks posting a .311/.365/.646 with 5 HR's and 15 RBI's over that span.

Jordan Schafer - CF Houston Astros

Unlike the previous two members of this list Schafer has been producing well through most of the year.  The reason he may still be available is because he has been dealing with a toe injury which has been causing his ownership to take a hit.  If owners dropped him in your league he is a great pickup especially if you need help in steals.

                -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All three players are trending up in terms of ownership so now is the chance to buy.  I will be go in depth on each player looking at both their careers leading to this point

Lucroy was the best C on waivers up until now

I don't think anyone is saying that Ianetta is going to keep up this torrid pace in hitting the ball, while Ianetta stays the same.

In regards to evaluating Ianetta, which is a reasonable explanation for his improved average: he is seeing pitches. Plus, even from his earliest days, many people thought (at the time and were right) that he was called up too early by the Rockies and wasn't ready.

22

Ventura has been great this season with a 2.96 ERA across AA and AAA. He also has 133 Ks in 112.1 innings and only 43 walks which is very nice to see. Ventura is the #26 prospect in all of baseball(according to Baseball America) and is the top Royals Prospect. He has a plus plus fastball that can reach up to 100 MPH to go along with an above average curveball and an average changeup. Look for Ventura to be a possible September call-up especially if the Royals need an extra boost in their rotation or bullpen  but he should be up for good and a permanent part of the rotation for the 2014 season.

**Gregory Polanco**

21

Polanco has had a great season and is now considered the #2 prospect in the Pirates system right behind Jameson Taillon. On the season Polanco has a .291 average to go along with 9 HRs

**Francisco Lindor**

19

Lindor was recently ranked as the #5 prospect in all of baseball by both Baseball America and MLB.com. He started off the year in High A and was then promoted to AA. On the season he has a .304 average to go along with 65 runs

**Carlos Correa**

18

With the season Byron Buxton has been having Correa has been overlooked a bit but regardless of that

I would also like to appologize for the two week hiatus I had

Pitcher A, who is having another great year in Seattle. He was drafted as a fantasy ace, and he's proving once again that he fits that bill.

Pitcher B is the combined contributions of David Robertson

While I understand that three roster spots hurts, on aggregate, are more valuable than King Felix and are *absolutely free* to acquire?

The trick is to bench your SPs until they're starting, but can definitely boost your totals in W, K, ERA and WHIP to elite levels if you can work the wire well enough to pull it off - again, at no cost to you in terms of drafting.

Yahoo's ""Trading Block""

Let's say an owner drops someone you want, do it a few times. That player you want is now off the Yahoo ""roster move"" listing on the main page. Sure, people can check to see earlier transactions, but maybe they won't.

West Coast all the way

Players with multi-position eligibility that play primarily in the Pacific Time Zone are substantially more useful then their East Coast brethren. Why? Because you can sit and wait to see if games are postponed/delayed or if a player unexpectedly takes a day off, as most of the time they've already played when the NL/AL West teams announce their lineups.

Early morning shuffling

It's a pain, MI, and CI slots the players with the latest games. It is worth the effort. How many times have you tried to rejigger your lineup, only to be hamstrung by positions already being locked down? This is particularly important in May and April, when so many games get rained out.

If you're too lazy to do that

Extra

If a team played a ton of extra innings the night before, if they're playing badly, they end up taking one for the team.  I believe this has already happened a couple of times this year.

I keep trying to get closers as Axford has been shit and Francisco (Mets) has been on the DL. I'm essentially down to one closer and I keep trying to get good-decent closers from Soriano to Rodney to Casilla to Chapman. Everytime I make an offer for one it gets countered with something like ""Casilla for Kinsler"" or ""Rodney for Sabathia"".

Is it just me or is this asking way too much for a closer? I need one pretty bad and have an extra SP I could dump but people are constantly countering with the philosophy ""He's a Top 5 closer

I've experienced success in leagues where I was unable to attend the draft. I've found that the computer shows no bias towards players I would typically avoid. For example, had I been present I may have done something like reach down for Carl Crawford last year, and that would not have gone over very well.

I've experienced success where I drafted players I felt good about and they wound up being as good as advertised. I've also drafted players I like and ignored good advice (Joe Mauer's health comes to mind).

I'm just curious to get some tips from people on this subreddit. How do you draft? What works for you? What websites are the most reliable for good information? Do you draft as best available or do you use position scarcity as a guide?

I enjoy looking at statistics and think that stats like wOBA and xFIP could be pretty excellent indicators of future success. Has anyone ever used statistics to create their own cheat sheet for drafting sleepers
