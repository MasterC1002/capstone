Without missing a beat, I figure. So I tell him the same thing I said before, ""We'll have them hauled over right away.""

Guy immediately pulls out yet **another** fistful of gold and repeats himself. What the hell? We do this again and again, but he **never** replies, unless it's to pull out another lump of gold and order 20 more logs.

We do this little routine over a dozen times, and without saying another word he turns, quickly snatches a butterfly out of the air, rips it in half, shoves both wings into his mouth, gets back on his horse, and then rides it straight into the river.

1353889287.0,13s95l,[Skyrim] My Marriage is a Sham,Ilidsor,252,28,18,"My name is Ysolda and I'm an Nord who lives in Whiterun. For the past few months I have been living a marriage that is a lie.

I met my husband in Whiterun as I was walking in the market. We talked for a bit and I told him about my dreams of becoming a merchant. He agreed to get me a Mammoth Tusk in return for a private lesson on bartering. I was already starting to fall for him.

After that I saw him around a few times but he didn't approach me to give me the tusk so I had assumed that he had lost interest in me. Then one day out of nowhere he shows up with the tusk. I gave him the lesson like I promised and while I was doing it I fell completely in love with him.

Then he left again and for the longest time I didn't see him. I greeted him whenever he was nearby though

The marriage was quick and we agreed to move into his house in Whiterun. The first surprise of the marriage was when I got there and found another woman living there with him already. I ignored it though

In the morning he took Lydia and left for a month. I spent the whole time worrying

Then he returned and it was like nothing had ever happened. He asked me for his share of the store money and for a homemade meal and I was so happy he was alive I gave them to him with a smile. It seemed like he was planning to stay now. He spent the first day at the blacksmiths and then came home and we spent two whole days in bed together. He never said a word to that Lydia girl. It was glorious. I thought that he was going to become a blacksmith and stay with me forever. 

It lasted for about a week and then he was gone again just as quickly as before. I was devastated. The only comfort was that he had not brought Lydia with him. We talked about him

Another month later he showed up to grab his share of the store money. He brought with him a very skimpily dressed girl that I recognized as a companion. He was gone before Lydia could even come downstairs to greet him. We cried together that night.

1365377364.0,1bvrdl,[Skyrim] My Dad's weird.,Ilidsor,230,28,13,"My Dad’s pretty weird.

My name is Lucia. I used to live on the streets in Whiterun begging for money just to stay alive. Nobody would take me in. Nobody cared. The only person who was nice to me was another beggar named Brenuin. That’s how I spent my days until one day one of the people I was begging from offered to adopt me. He was wearing really cool armour he called “ebony” and he walked right up to me and told me I could live with him. I was so happy I almost couldn’t believe it.
When we got to the house I was a bit scared of it because it was right beside a swamp but I was too happy about finally having a family to care. When I got inside I was greeted by my new mother Mjoll. She hugged me right away and I could just tell it was meant to be. I also met Papa’s steward Aela the Huntress and his bard Sonir. Sonir also sadly mentioned a houscarl that used to live there but was killed fighting with Papa.

When it was late I was sent to bed so Papa and Mommy could go and get what Papa called his “resting bonus” whatever that means.

The next morning Papa was gone again and when he came back I had a sister! I was so happy I almost cried. Then he made yet another trip and I got a dog he called Meeko! I had to pinch myself constantly just to check to see if I was dreaming.

It wasn’t until a week later that I began to wonder if something was up with Papa. 

First of all there’s an entire room of the house we’re not supposed to go into. It’s Papa’s armoury and Papa always keeps the doors shut. So naturally Sophie and I dared each other to go in there to take a look. What we found inside was… it’s hard to describe. There were weapons and armour everywhere, staffs that I didn’t even want to touch and armour that looked beyond ancient. I guess I understand why Papa doesn’t want us playing in there but it’s so beautiful. I just can’t help but wonder where he got it all.

The second thing that’s weird about my Papa is that he builds things really fast. I mean *really* fast. One night I went to sleep and when I woke up we had a cellar. It was filled with shrines

The absolute weirdest thing though is that he sometimes leaves for a week and then comes back home with entirely new skills. New magic, Aela, and Sonir where walking around in their underwear. They still haven’t put clothes back on for some reason even though it’s really cold. 

He does other weird stuff too like standing completely still for hours

I love him anyways though. Because he let me into his family. And because he loves me.

After he crossed the bridge he turned and looked at me. My hair stood on end. This was no normal Khajiit. I don't think this thing was even mortal. He approached and dismounted his horse. He stood next to me and looked me over. The whole situation was rather uncomfortable so I decided to break the silence. 

I smiled at him and said ""You're a well traveled sort

He responded with nothing but silence. This situation was growing more awkward by the second. He just stood there

I lifted my cup to my lips and drank as he watched. I spoke again. ""Working hard gives a man a reason for drinking hard. Well

This time he actually responded. ""Sounds like you're having some trouble with your wife."" He spoke in a thick Khajiit accent. 

I was slightly surprised by the fact that he finally spoke. I sighed and said ""Her name's Olda. If you've met her then you probably already know what I'm talking about.  I swear that woman is the most spiteful shrew in all of Skyrim. I think there's a chunk of ice where her heart ought to be."" 

At this he turned and climbed back onto his horse and rode away into the town. It was a strange encounter alright
At the time I thought nothing of it

This asshole then walked to the corner of my inn to one of my daily customers, but still lost to this bastard who was obviously picking a fight with everyone. Uthgerd then paid this bastard for beating her up. 

This ""brawler"" finally sat down next to the fire. Sinmir turned to him and gave him his usual ""Whiterun Guard"" rant, and the two of them went upstairs. Not only did that asshole beat up my bard and one of my customers, he took my servant away from her work shift! I waited for a while and was considering to go up to make sure they weren't up to no good, but ""brawler"" came down and left my inn.

Bastard came in the later that night and went up to Saadia, but I saw that as a good thing, because Talos know what he would do if he spent a night in my inn!

I didn't see ""brawler"" for a while, and hoped that he wouldn't tell report me to the guards for spreading rumors about the Jarl.

I hear a noise.  Is that a test subject?  I hope it is a test subject.

""Hellooo?""  I say.  A rat scuttles across the floor.  It is not a test subject.  I shoot the rat anyway.  It gives me something to do.

It has now been a few hours since I shot the rat.  There have been no test subjects passing through the test chamber.  If robots could be bored I would be bored.  But I am a robot so I am not bored.

Suddenly I hear another turret.  

""Is anybody there?""  Then the other turret begins shooting.  Somebody is there.  

If robots could be excited

""Helloooo?""  I say again.  I hope it is not another rat.  In the distance I hear the other turret.  

""Shutting down.""  
That means that the test subject has deactivated the other turret.  If robots could be sad I would be sad.  But I am a robot so I am not sad.  I hear the test subject come closer but I cannot yet see it.

""Could you come over here?""  I ask the test subject politely.  I need it to come over here so I can kill it.  The test subject comes into view.  I shoot at the test subject.  A few bullets hit it.  The test subject ducks out of sight.

""Are you still there?""  I hope the test subject is still there.  I hear it fire the portal gun.  The test subject then peeks around the corner and fires the portal gun onto the wall behind me.  

""There you are.""  I say.  I shoot at the test subject and it ducks back out of sight.  I suddenly realise I am now in trouble.

The test subject is likely to travel through the portal and come out behind me.  If I could turn around I would be able to shoot the test subject easily.  But I cannot turn around.  This is not good.  There is a high chance the test subject will deactivate me.

Sure enough a few seconds later I am lifted off the floor by the test subject who had sneaked behind me.  If I was not a robot I would be scared.  But I am a robot so I am not scared.

""Put me down!""  Perhaps if I act like I am scared the test subject will not deactivate me.  I try to make my guns face backwards so I can shoot the test subject but they will not rotate that far. 

The test subject drops me on the floor and I fall on my side.  

""AAAGHHHH"".  I will deactivate in a few seconds.  I fire my guns wildly.   I don't want to deactivate.  Am I scared?  I feel scared but I am a robot so surely I cannot be scared.

But I am not dead.

My underground adventures led me to the depths of this strange earth. My never-ending search for precious stones brought me to that lake of fire. Little did I know that the lake would be my grave.

But I am not dead. No tomb holds me.

The massive diamonds that drove me to craft a bridge of dirt across that firey divide still lay locked in stone. Just out of reach. Who would've thought that a simple misstep at the edge would result in so much pain? No words describe the agony of heat and flame that melted my flesh and ended my life.

But I am not dead. My bones remain.

My worldy possessions met the same fate as my fragile form. All but my bow and quiver of arrows; thrown from my hands as I lost my step. These items hold faint memory of who I once was. I will keep them. 

A spider, bleached fingers. Skittering legs turn the creature to its side. Does it bend down? Am I to ride this creature of the dark abyss?

How much time has passed? The spider has come and gone and come again. It brings others with it. Some are spiders. The others are more dark. Fiendish. The spiders live their lives. They have grown old and died and new generations have come to accept me as friend and rider. Some part of me misses the first. But that part has grown so small of late. Sadness is replaced with anger. Why am I here? I remember. I died.

But I am not dead. 

A noise. Like crumbling sand. Rocks and dirt. A light breaks through. A figure wrought in iron emerges from the wall. What creature seeks the dark abyss? The lake of fire and death? Why does a faint memory tug at the corners of ancient past? Anger flushes the faint tug away. The creature seeks the diamonds I sought to claim so long ago. They are mine. 

The young spiders die in their assault with me against the creature. Arrow after arrow I fire from my withered bow. The spider I ride is cut from under me. Another arrow finds its mark in the creature's side. It crumples. I feel another tug of distant memory. It mimics a forgotten feeling. What does victory mean? The creature stirs. My fight is not over.

But wait... Those eyes. They are not the same. The creature that rises from amidst the strewn remains spilled upon death is not the same that fought before. Mumbled moans escape the lips that already show signs of decay. Perhaps the creature truly is dead. Impossible. It moves. It shares my fate. But not my fate. The flesh remains. Lifeless eyes stare at me. I see a look only briefly grasped as hunger. No help can I offer this new creature. No flesh remains on my dusty bones. I died.

All I know is that after a seemingly endless void of emptiness

I was on a road and I could see others just as confused as I. Regardless of the situation I pushed on and made my way to the gate in the distance; winding back and forth between the narrow pavement road which inevitably led me to my destination.

As soon as I reached the gates I noticed that the people ahead of me were going in freely without obstruction


-----


I suddenly realize where I am; an amusement park.

Aside from the rides the park itself was incredibly dirty with no signs of garbage bins or brooms-men. I continued to walk down a dirty road which seemed to lead into a dark building. I slowly realize that I cannot walk off the pavement; as hard as I tried I could not bring my feet off the walk-ways of the park... almost as if I were magnetized to the ground beneath.

There were so many people



Am I dead? Am I in heaven? 

As I ponder about my location I suddenly realize that I have come to a dead end

I look up and see what I am waiting for

-----

By the time the line shortens and I'm the 10th person in line the machine starts to play distorted music and the current riders of the coaster crash into another ride because the brakes failed to stop the moving cart...

In an instant I turn around and everyone in the line starts walking in reverse fashion; leaving. I do take one glance behind me



I talk to someone beside me


*""Dude you see that SCARY COASTER #55?!?""*
*""There was an accident! No way I'm going on that!""*




I turn back to the field to see the very same coaster in the same spot. While I didn't line up this time

The man that once stood beside me was off on a hurry to get in line again. I catch very vaguely what he says before leaving earshot-distance:


*""Oh wow look at that ride

After that weird hiatus I return back to the food-court section of the park. I find it rather shocking that everything in the park is free, and even umbrellas.

I start to look through the food stalls.

I stop lining up and decide that I should find an atm.

1361904725.0,199ur5,[Borderlands 2] My head feels funny...,Shooty_McFace,137,23,7,"Sometimes I miss whatever I had when Pandora was booming. I don't know if it's in the air or the water that is making my mind go. I remain somewhat more articulate than...I guess they're my brothers. What do you call a group of bandits that are lead by a vault hunter? We're not heroes by any mean, they raise a flag

I see the madness taking hold in them, but it always seeps in. Maybe it isn't in the air at all, maybe it's the thought of that vault, that's what floats around on the air. Not a pathogen of Pandora, but an idea, the idea of the vault holding the answer to all of life's problems.

I had a friend not too long ago, protecting what was left of my friend, hoping one day his mind would come back. I never got the chance to find out. One day when we were looking for, well, anyhting we could get our hands on, he was torn in half by a bullymong. It threw both halves at me right before I managed to kill it. I kept his mask, mainly because it helps me feel less alone. The worst part is, all I can think is how finding the vault might have helped him

Maybe that's why more vault hunters came to Pandora. Jack kills most of them, one of them. They found a vault and all it had was some monster. Why do they stay now though? Do they have the same madness that is gripping all of us? Can they not leave the planet? They did great things but can't seem to leave, all their power and might worth nothing. They're still slaves to the vault like the rest of us. If their might and power can't over come the madness, how can I? I can already feel it in my head. How long until I am no more than a screaming violent psychopath? I can't let this happen. There's only one way out of this, and I can't say I like it. But how? I don't think I can take being ripped apart by the animals of Pandora. Then again, we *are* on a huge cliffside, but I'm not sure if I can bring myself to do it. 

I hear gunshots.

The new vault hunters have arrived. This may be how I go. I don't want to attack them though, or whatever that hovering ball thing is. No, I want one clean shot in the head. Is this the madness talking? Do I want to live if this is what my mind may become? No, I want this. Maybe, I'll get back what I used to have before Pandora. I'll wear my friend's mask so I don't have to be so alone, so they won't see the terror and regret in my eyes. My best course of action is to probably just act as insane as possible and demand to be shot in the face. I don't want to go out begging, no, just one bullet to the face. I should get to a good spot. 

They're drawing closer. There's a lot of death around me

""I hear you deliver letters, and heard the rustle of leather against the expensive material.  
""That I do, ten if it'll put me in danger.""  
There was a pause while I looked down at the letter. Then: ""Better make this ten
""Whoa, it's only ten septims,"" I said loyally.  
""Oh, so I can't guarantee that you'll be safe. She's in Whiterun right now, I believe.""  
""Again? Wow, looking up at the woman. Her face was concealed so that all I could see was her stunning blue eyes.  
It was enough. In my slightly intoxicated state
""Hmm. So you know how she looks
""She's been wearing daedric armor most of the time, I found her after she fought a dragon once. I'll remember that Shouting easily.""  
The woman's eyes sparkled. ""Good luck
I picked through the bag and found twenty septims. ""Hey
She paused at the threshold and looked back at me
  
I took the letter and headed to Whiterun, the guards were all in a tizzy about something. Just as I got inside, I was grabbed by a sharp-clawed creature. A guard let out a shout of alarm, and suddenly an arrowhead was pointed straight at my face.  
The creature fell away and I realized it was a... something. I couldn't tell. Furry and hulking, it abruptly staggered to its feet, shake its heavy head, and bounded away with the arrow still through its neck.  
A guard helped me to my feet
I looked down at myself. My collar was a little ripped where the creature's claws had grabbed me, I'm fine. What was that thing?""  
""We think they might be werewolves
""Werewolves! Like in all the myths? I didn't think they were real.""  
""No one thought dragons were real
""Oh
The guard lifted his helmet a little bit and scratched at his neck. ""Oh
""Thanks
The guard nodded formally. ""Watch the skies
  
The Bannered Mare was comfortably warm and homey,"" while a serving maid daintily swept the floor, and an elderly man grumbled about Whiterun's security. It was quite pleasant.  
""Do you have any rumors about the Dragonborn?"" I asked the woman standing at the counter
She snorted. ""There are rumors on other topics?"" Seeing my puzzled face, owner of the Bannered Mare. As for rumors, well, there's not much recently. Supposedly the Dragonborn was heading out of town on her way to Windhelm to talk to Ulfric. Wants to get a feel for both sides of the war, you see.""  
I tried not to groan. Windhelm was far away and colder than a hagraven's tit.  
Hulda looked sympathetically at me. ""Look, so I could just give it to her. No sense in putting yourself in danger.""  
I began to reply, and I bet you this here staff I could outdrink you!""  
I always had fancied myself to stay sober longer than any other Nord while drinking. ""You're on.""  
  
My head still hurt. After sorting out a huge mess with a hagraven, a temple of Dibella, and eventually the Daedric Prince Sanguine himself, my hangover only seemed worse. I took some comfort in the fact that I had apparently had a wonderful night, but only a little. My tunic was stained with wine - I didn't have the time to buy a new one, but the stain was faint. The letter was still safe, though
I was finally at Windhelm. Assuming the Dragonborn would only be in one place
""Dragonborn? Oh, she broke into the Aretino residence and ended up doing something for the boy there.""  
I staggered to the nearest chair. I'd missed the Dragonborn again!  
""You know, on the road is the best place for it.""  
""Thank you
  
As I strode tiredly up the road, no, I thought, another werewolf, or a frost troll. I'll never see the end of this.  
Then there was a shrieking whinny and over the rise before me
The horse neighed loudly again and came to a halt
A dragon!  
That howl of rage
Ah! She was here then! Absurdly inappropriate joy bubbled up in me as I realized my target was right nearby. If the dragon didn't best her...
""YOL-TOOR-SHUL!""  
A blast of fire exploded over the hill. I struggled to get to my feet just in time to see a black-and-red, right behind it, was the dragon.  
Its crimson hide glittered as it rose up like a massive daedra, my fear-crazed mind babbled - and gleaming golden eyes that smoldered with hate and wrath burned furiously through the choking smog.  
Even as terrible and powerful as it was, DOVAHKIIN!"" it bellowed, sending a wave of heat rolling over me and nearly knocking me flat again.  
As the Dragonborn passed me
I let out a very un-Nordic scream of terror as it reached down and picked me up in its stinking jaws. Though it did not bite down, when the Dragonborn spoke.  
""Drop the man now!"" she shouted
""AHH,"" the dragon roared. Then it shook its great heavy head back and forth... and hurled me away.  
As it did so, by some miracle, my letter pouch stayed with me.  
My eyes squinted closed as I prepared for the impact that would surely kill me. I tried to remember all my happy moments - meeting the blue-eyed woman in Falkreath was certainly the first to come to mind - and found that I had very few. Maybe I shouldn't have become a courier. But it was too late for that now
Instead
""Ouff!"" The air escaped from my lungs in one great rush as I slid down the strange surface to land on my rear in the dust.  
I sucked in air gratefully, I was breathing - far better than how I had expected to fare.  
But what was I leaning against? I felt behind me. Thick
I had landed on a mammoth.  
I leaned my head back and gazed up at the starry night sky
Then a sudden burst of flashing color filled the sky
Oh! But I had to deliver my letter to her! I tried to climb to my feet and found that it was incredibly difficult to do so. Entangling my hand in long mammoth fur, simply snorted and went back to sleep while a hulking giant stood guard nearby should a real threat have revealed itself.  
The Dragonborn was snapping charred and blackened bones off of the dragon's ribcage when I reached her
I didn't bother trying to explain. ""I've been looking for you. Got something I'm supposed to deliver - your hands only."" Before she could speak, and her face darkened.
Nervously I said, I fled to find the nearest town and get a new tunic.  
  
""Ya know,"" the farmer slurred cheerily. ""Not one 'a those crazy... those crazy...""  
""Black-Briar drinkers
""Thassit,"" he agreed with a hearty laugh. ""I like this guy here cuz' he drinks Honningbrew Mead. An' he's gen'rous!""  
I had found a small town nearby and managed to find an old tattered tunic to wear until I could buy a proper one. Then I'd headed to the inn so I could drink away the night. The two farmers sitting with me, on the edge of intoxication.  
""Ya know what
""Hey, pal, ya wanna preach the vir.. vir..."" he trailed off, unable to remember the world.  
""Virtue?"" I suggested.  
He laughed hugely and threw an arm around my shoulders with a grin. ""Thas' the one!"" His breath was rank

It’s just that I’m not sure I’m doing anyone a service by following this... madwoman. She kills! Anything. That even *looks* like it’s giving her the stink-eye. And innumerable deer and goats that don’t. Sometimes she doesn’t even use an axe, fire and lightning like some kind of Thalmor toady elf. The woman will steal anything that’s not nailed down, and if people were in the practice of nailing down things she wanted, I think she’d just rip them up and go on her merry way. Her gods-given gift of the dragon tongue? She uses it to chase butterflies. Or knock people off of mountains. Or knock butterflies off mountains, turn into a ghost, and then jump off the mountain after them - it took me two days to find her after that episode, and she was covered in blood that may or may not have been hers and grinning like a maniac. She gave me fifteen cheese wheels and a Falmer ear. I didn’t ask.


It might have been okay if she inspired any kind of loyalty in me, not Lydia-the-talented-and-hardworking-warrior, but Lydia-the-glorified-pack-mule. Every time she looks in my direction, I just know she’s going to hand me whatever dross she’s accumulated since the last time she noticed her pack getting heavy - sometimes it’s books or weapons, sometimes it’s the hundreds of smelly, bloody hides, sometimes it’s the skulls she picks up in ruins, but she has more brooms in her room in Breezehome than I ever thought possible. She usually tells me to wait outside whatever cave or dungeon she wants to pillage next, still follow her in. She’s given me a thousand ways to regret that decision - she “accidentally” swipes me with her sword - “you big baby, it’ll probably make you smarter once the muscle tics wear off” - or lectures me for hours after I step on one damn pressure plate that just happens to trigger a spiked gate swinging into her face. I’m sorry


She’s been talking to some suspicious-looking characters lately, the peace and quiet that followed was pure bliss. She just got back, though - said something about the Emperor being dead? I think we would have heard something like that... Anyway, we’re going somewhere tomorrow - she read some book, “Boethiah’s Proving”, and now she’s off on some hare-brained Daedra-worshipping scheme. I’d really rather stay out of it, but she’s going to command me to follow and damned if I won’t just do my duty like always. Oh well. Whatever she’s got planned probably can’t be *that* much worse than how she usually spends her time...

Oh

Mr. Peters. Even giving me a name. Good cop all the way

Wow. You're not serious

Do you honestly think you're gonna take back the Mojave from her? Look me in the eye, and tell me with a straight face that you and the rest of the NCR are going to take back what's ours.

You're wrong. I was NCR. Not any more.

For fuck's sake

You wanna hear it again? Fine.

So it was after the second battle of Hoover Dam. I was Warrant Officer Kurt Frost, but somehow she'd managed to smooth-talk Major General Webley into working with her. 

No, no threats, nothing.

Anyway, now taken over by Legionnaires who were using the single valley entrance as a chokepoint. Our job was to scale the cliffs and keep an eye on their movements- while they weren't going anywhere, we'd have to clear them out sooner or later and NCR command wanted better intel. Turns out they had their eye on us the minute we came near Red Rock Canyon- we though we had the element of stealth and surprise, but I suppose that wasn't the case.

We were halfway up a smaller cliff face when I heard the first volley of shots ring out. Cheap cowboy repeaters that wouldn't be able to bust through our armour, let go of his cable and slammed into the ground, face first. Probably died as he hit the ground. Torres and I got lucky- we managed to get back onto solid ground without taking any serious injuries. We were quickly surrounded, managed to kill a few of 'em, but there were just too many of them. 

I woke up later, and while they certainly weren't nice to us, it was nothing a Ranger couldn't handle. We had water, gruel, and they didn't beat us often enough for me to really complain.

Days passed, that when you've been in the buisness of killing for country as long as I have that you learn things. You realize that the people you fight with, the people you fight against- they're not all one big group of people with the same ideas. I saw some legionnaires there who couldn't have been older than eighteen, ninteen. I looked around and saw these kids, wandering around aimlessley, terrified of what the next day would bring. Terrified that everything they'd learnt, everything the Legion had drilled into them, the confused ones

And then there were the ones who'd done this shit for so long that the very concept of fear of defeat just pissed them off more. Those were the ones who would beat us. This is important.

So six days passed, called himself Grumio, popped in front of us carrying a radio. He said that my superiors wanted a word with me. So Torres and I got on the radio, and there was Lieutenant General Church.

You know what that son of a bitch told me? He told me that we were simply no forces available to help. Said we were stretched too thin

And Church fucking ordered Webley to shut the fuck up. Church congratulated us on our performance

Grumio asked me what my rank was. Turns out he was more or less a Warrant Officer himself


It was less than an hour later when we heard it. Torres and I were planning our escape

It was HER.

A woman's voice, Mr. Peters, but I know a good, what's the word, orator? Orator, when I hear one.

""Legionnaires of Red Rock Canyon. Caesar is dead, fled like the coward he is.""

""I am the Courier you know as Sylvia. I ask that you release the hostages you have taken. Do this now

""You have an hour to surrender to my forces. Those who surrender will face a future of cooperation and safety. Know that in an hour

This is when her voice lost all trace of the kindness and warmth. Then there was only this rage, and it terrified me. And there's not much that scares me, Mr. Peters.

""There will be no trial, and you shall know my hatred. I shall slaughter until Red Rock Canyon is filled with your blood and corpses. In the end, I will stand upon a mountain of your skulls and your only comrades will be the ravens that pick the flesh from your bones. You have one hour.""

Yes, and I can plainly tell you that I was no longer NCR that very second. I remember it because it was terrifying. It was the voice of someone who had authority over life and death, someone who gave mercy with one hand and death with the other.

Anyway, to go and find their lives. That left, oh, I dunno, forty or so legionary veterans. Grumio grabbed a megaphone once the younger kids had left.

""Those who wished to surrender have done so, morituri te salutant!""

And less than five minutes later

Yes

Trust me, and in the span of two or three seconds managed to score headshots on thirty legionnaires.

Yes. You heard me right. Thirty shots

That left about ten soldiers, last one standing, charged at her, and she just flipped him onto the ground and stabbed him in the neck.

And that was it. One woman, and there she was. Asian, short hair, with telltale pale skin- someone who didn't take their helmet off very often. She was pretty, looking almost motherly, except, you know

She helped us up

I accepted in an instant.

You might not know it, every day she's busy. Helping the poor, killing bandits and raiders, overseeing defences, negotiating treaties...she's a force of nature. Maybe you'll understand on-

I never thought that being the Jarl of Whiterun could be such a terrible fate. My pride

By that damn Dragonborn.

When I first met him, and consumed the beast’s soul. Any doubts I had entertained in my mind after his accomplishment were cast aside once I heard the shout of the Greybeards from their perch at High Hrothgar. “Dovahkiin!”, they called. A bitter taste rose in my mouth as that ancient name came rolling across the plains like thunder. To know that that mere prisoner of a man could be Dragonborn, while I myself could not even master the use of the Thu'um.

He returned from his kill to ask my guidance. Reluctantly, he began tip-toeing his way to the room behind my throne. I felt compelled to remain seated and followed his course by moving my head until he was out of my sight. 

He returned hours later, and threw it at my Housecarl, Irileth. She asked him why he did that, and he responded by jumping on the table and running across it, sending food and dishes flying about the room. 

Before he exited Dragonsreach, as it was something I had wanted to do for a long time. That kid has problems… pain in the ass.)

I was not amused when, jewel, and piece of food had been stolen from me. I had to beat the servants within an inch of their lives, as it was clearly their fault. No wonder my daughter is always complaining about the lack of good sweet rolls, damn peasants are stealing them!

I did not lay eyes on the wretch for several months after he slew the dragon. I had been secretly hoping that he had slipped on some troll dung and cart-wheeled down the side of the mountain. 

Then one day, then dropped about fifty bloody rags onto the floor. I do not want to know where he pulled them from... maybe that wasn't blood on them at all, come to think of it. 

Suddenly he pulled out a cruel hammer that had what looked like a glowing red eye set inside its spiked surface. The Dragonborn let out a battle cry and began beating on Irileth. This angered me, full of Nordic wrath. I struck him repeatedly, but to no avail. Irileth, though bloody and broken and in a posture of complete defeat… would not die. 

I had little time to reflect on this oddity before my skull was cracked wide by his mighty hammer and I felt my stamina draining. I fell to my knees, my arms shattered like rotten kindling, but I would not die. The assault continued for several minutes until I heard a drum roll, though I knew not where it came from. Upon hearing this, the Dragonborn put his hammer away and made to leave. He stopped at the stairs and turned around, a spark of spiteful glee in his eyes. He opened his mouth and drew in a large breath, and before I knew what was happening, and the contents of my dinner table where once again strewn about my keep. He chuckled and finally left.

He began to make regular appearances after that, we bled… but no, we would not die. 

I snuck away one night to see if I was really immortal. Irileth found me a week later, but my pleas either went unheard or the Nine simply did not care.

If I had been told when I was a child that I was immortal, to have my body and my desire to live broken again and again. To watch my own children be engulfed in flames, screaming and crying as their flesh sizzles, only to be fine again in a few seconds, and then have the torture unleashed upon them once again. 

And all while the Dragonborn laughs, burned, frozen, pick-pocketed, Shouted at. Dremora have been summoned to abuse us. All for the sake of some drum rolls. I still do not know their significance, though they clearly have some importance to the Dragonborn.

I fine him every time

Sometimes.

Yet I feel there is hope. As I stood looking out over the vast plains of Whiterun this morning

Good. Let the Dunmer deal with him… though Alduin and his kin still ravage the land of Skyrim. Damn Dragonborn didn’t even do his job.

If only there were another Dragonborn to take his place…

Update:

The bastard came back riding on a dragon. He used the foul creature to burn down Whiterun. We had just gotten everything back to normal after the damage the Civil War had caused! 

Every citizen of Whiterun is dead except for a few of us (at least I am not alone in my misery). I send hordes and hordes of guards after the Dragonborn (where in Oblivion do they keep coming from?) and he shrugs them away like nothing. I give up.

Curse the Nine! Curse the daedra lords!

Get that armour sorted out, maybe even find a weapon worth a damn. Take on some work around Windhelm, practice those shaky skills, maybe eat a few more sweetrolls so she don't get knocked over by every strong wind that come barrelling down through the Grey Quarter. Make some coin. Sweet mother of Talos, that girl knows how to make coin.

But Quintus or not, and she sure as Oblivion won’t listen to what I got to say on the matter. Truth is I ain't got no way left to impress that girl, save for hittin things real hard till they don't get up, and that's business as usual these days.

Something changed all that recently. One day these two stormcloaks come running into town. At least I think they were both stormcloaks, odd but I have heard the local flowers do have quite a few alchemical properties. Eventually they part ways, Gerdur's relative who I found out was named Ralof stayed for a few days before heading back to Windhelm, his companion left town towards Whiterun a few days beforehand though.

For a few weeks after that I thought things were going back to the same old bore, he actually listened to my stories of battles I've run though my head dozens of times, though he did seem a bit expressionless at times.Then what seems like out of nowhere he wants me to follow him on his  adventures! I hardly hesitate because I will finally get a chance to live my dream.

He says he wants to trade some things so I jokingly say ""Think of me like a two legged pack mule, it wasn't long before I regretted those words.

I finally found out how strange this fellow truly was. First of all he runs EVERYWHERE. I try my best to keep up but even when I fall behind I find him waiting just up the road

We make our way towards a bandit hideout near Bleak Falls barrow, my hammer connected with the back of their skull in a sickening crunch. I had never swung at a real live person before let alone killed anyone! In a sad way though I got used to it fast, as every single fight we got into turned this way, him drawing their attention and me caving in the back of their skull, whether man, mer, beast or undead

Then there was the aftermath of every fight. He would go around from corpse to corpse collecting EVERY SINGLE POSSESSION. Now

It was hard enough chasing after him in just MY armor, but so does he! He fires off his lightning as soon as we are in sight of the next opponent, usually before they even have a chance to notice us.

Always was a wimp. So we follow this long trail of blood splatters, and we find the rest of Joe. Shit, what a *mess!*

His head was in pieces (I stepped in a piece of his brain), as if he'd been lazered or sumthin'. So, I said we should run back, but Knife just laughs and tells me not to be a coward, and that we should stay here, find who killed Joe and get a little revenge.

So we wait for a couple minutes by the big rock, he musta been using one of those silenced guns. Probably a snipper rifle, at that kinda range. So I poke my head out over the rock, and I swear to god, I saw these glowin' red eyes over the hill, like we're being shot by a fucking deemon or somethin'. Then this laser beam comes outta nowhere and hits Sledge's rifle, sendin' it flying way back.

The red-eyed guy raises his hand, and the robot beeps and stops. Then he comes round the rock Hammer was hiding behind, and just blows his fuckin' head off. Knife runs out screaming and shoots him a cupple times, but the red-eyed guy just ignores him and blows both his arms off. Never seen anyone shoot that fast.

Then he came for me.

He just stood there, but before I could swing he just grabbed it out of my hand, held it up in the air, shot the blayd, and threw it away. That was my favorite, too. I reeched for my 10mm, but he grabbed it and put it in his coat. He told me to put my hands up, and got a small black one with a short barrel. I managed to get a glimps of other stuff under his coat, and this real fancy one with a club on the handle. He had one of those 12.7 pistols too

Then before I got a chance to run for it, the deemon was gone. I limped my way back to Vault 3 and gave Motor-Runner the message. Cocky bastard just laughed it off. But not even Motor could take that guy. He had at least *six* guns, and I think I saw one of those old Pre-War Japanees sords on his back. And that armur? Knife shot him and he just *ignored* it.

A few days later we're up in Winterhold and heading west out of the town into the frozen north-lands. I'm sure I'm about to freeze to death and to be honest I was starting to doubt this guy. He'd hardly spoken a word to me since we left and has only told me that we're going to some ruin. After we left Winterhold it didn't take us more than a day to find it. A massive Dwemmer ruin embedded in the side of a glacier! It was amazing. We fought side by side killing old Dwemmer constructs and what felt like a small army of those Falmer things. It was so incredible I didn't even mind that he made me carry everything. 

Eventually we got to what I thought was the bottom where we fought some massive golem (I think he called it a Centurion?) and these two other adventurers who were down there. Just when I thought our delve into this ruin was over he walks over to this odd, and this giant steel ball of glowing light that lit most of the cavern. We fought our way through an army of Falmer and their bizarre insect creatures. Eventually we make it into a big tower and ride a moving platform to it's peak (Unbelievable what the Dwarves could build sometimes) At the top there was this big mechanism that he worked artfully, as though he'd done it a dozen times before and low and behold within the machine was an *Elder Scroll*!

1363740446.0,1amrb8,[Skyrim] The Thief and the Dandy,civaddicted,83,12,2,"Dear diary

Today was one of those days that you realise the actual absurdity of this plane we live on. Honestly

I had been hiding out in the Rift ambushing travelers after having to bolt from Whiterun after an 'unfortunate' incident in the Bannered Mare. The war and the return of the dragons had been good for business. Plenty of displaced farmers and a few lightly guarded noblemen were lightened of their burdensome coin purses.

Today though I thought my ship had arrived. A 'dapper' fellow arrived on MY road

As he got closer I discerned he was a dunmer. A slight fellow, golden jewelry shimmering with rare gems, a goddamned jeweled circlet on his head, running around, unguarded, picking flowers and catching butterflies with not a care in the world! 

He was even wearing gloves so his fingers would stay clean

He must have been an apostle of Dibella or a master of the bards college or something because he somehow persuaded me to leave him on his way. As I turn to let him pass I am staggered by a firebolt to the back.

Two or three more of these hit me and I crumple to the ground. I yield to him

My blood is pumping, worth more for pride than value! If I could only find the strength to rise, even for a moment I could run him through. But here he is. He raised his hands and I see his mana flow into form. I saw what I thought was the birth of my death and it was horrifying.

Before he blasted me my whole being clenched tight, all I felt was serenity. I was at peace. I no longer thought I needed my dagger, I thought, why did I ever need a dagger? I looked up, smiling and in pure bliss to thank him.

He was gone. I was still weak but felt content to lie on the road for a while. Then my senses returned. I drank some potions to recover some health and decided to get the hell out of the Rift as soon as I could.

I thought I saw some weird things done by the forsworn in the Reach but  maybe it's just a 'Skyrim' thing. I think I should just move back to the Imperial City.

‘For the infamy you have brought upon my family and upon your own, resentment and detestation for all of your days.’

I'm impressed that he figured out our currency so quickly though. This outsider has more than earned his welcome here, in my opinion. The Priest is still very skiddish around him, but no longer locks the door when he approaches. May take a while for him to relax, understandable after what he's been through.*

I took a walk earlier this morning and noticed he had added a new window. There are two large chests and a hole in the ground. Where could it lead?* 

*April 27th*

*There are.... Strange things on the walls now. They look like snowmen. They, we've been hearing this strange noise underground. Some strange warping wail.  We'd been hearing a lot of digging underground, ever since the creature arrived. What is he up to? The Priest fears for the worst. Maybe I'll ask him... Find a way to communicate.*

*No dice... Didn't understand a word I said...  As I was trying to talk to him, but we don't have a blacksmith anymore! He died in the first raid of our town. Oh well... Maybe someone will try their hand at it. Farms are doing well, and there's even livestock. Gotta focus more on that now.

The city in itself was a great place to live, houses looted for whatever scavengers could find. It was chaos. That's why I signed on for the guard. I felt as a citizen of Dunwall, it was my duty to keep some semblance of order. Sure, I wasn't going to be finding cures any time soon, but the pay is good, and it's better than sitting around under a bridge waiting to waste away.

Our great and powerful city was ruled by an equally great and powerful empress, she was, til she got herself killed. By her own bodyguard, no less! Corvo was his name. He got himself a death sentence in Coldridge, and was held there for a day or so. Bastard escaped and was on the loose for quite a while.

'Twas around this time I was assigned to Kaldwin Bridge. I had advanced quite a bit, but I guess that's good enough for the higher-ups. My men and I were protecting Anton Sokolov, a painter and inventor. Man was a genius, but paranoid as all hell. Had half the city guard protecting him, and lived 10 stories off the ground, easy. No idea what he was so scared of, but I wasn't the one to ask questions with the coin he was offering.

Watch seemed to be going well, I had a few guards to throw around. Sent them down that way, and they didn't come back either. If you want something done right, they says. Hope Sokolov doesn't mind a few officers gone missing...

I managed to make my way down to the reported area without much trouble. What I saw there, there was no one. I started looking around, although I won't lie, I was a tad spooked. Weepers are too damned dull to hide bodies, and why would looters bother?  

It didn't take me long to find what I was looking for. I entered one of the old boarded-up houses, filled with some kind of green liquid. Others had marks on their necks, like they had been... choked?

The mystery solved itself as I felt arms close round my thoat.

I woke up alongside my comrades

A while later, it didn't take that long for people to work it out. He was the one going around kidnapping and murdering all these people. Granted, most of them were complete idiots, but still.

I agreed to move into his house in Whiterun against the wishes of Lucan (selfish bastard didn't want to work a double shift). Life was great with my new husband. I was able to open a small store to keep myself occupied while he was out adventuring. I worried that something bad would happen to him but he was a strong nord and I knew he would always return to me. One day while my husband was away I was at the Bannered Mare when I heard that the emperors cousin was getting married in Solitude. The emperors cousin! What a beautiful ceremony that would be! Hulda told me that the reception was open to the public and I began to dream of going. I had never been to the capital and decided that when my husband returned I would talk to him about attending the reception. He came home two days later and when I brought up the subject of going to solitude for the wedding he rejected the idea firmly. I was disappointed but I loved my husband and respected his authority. The day after the wedding word came to Whiterun that the emperors cousin had been murdered at her wedding! In the following days rumors that the Dark Brotherhood carried out the assassination were spreading like wildfire. My husband came home and said he was only in town for the night. Over dinner we discussed the rumors and he laughed at the thought of the Dark Brotherhood being responsible for a murder that high profile. He said the Brotherhoods glory days were gone and they wouldn't dare attempt anything so big and that was the end of the conversation. We went to bed and for the first time I began to wonder if I really knew who my husband was, throat slit, could my husband be behind this? I filled my tankard with wine and downed it with one gulp. No. He's a good man

""My dearest Camilla

By now you will have heard about the Dark Brotherhoods attempt on the emperors life. In the following days you will also hear something quite disturbing. You will hear that it was I who carried out this attack and I regret to inform you that it is true. It was also I who killed the Pentius Oculatus agent, and the emperors cousin. I do not have time to explain to you my reasons for choosing this path in life but do know, that I love you. I am on my way to Solitude to kill Commander Maro and the REAL emperor of Tamriel. You may find comfort in knowing that this is the end of the Dark Brotherhood. We were betrayed by one of our own and after this those of us who survived must go into hiding. Goodbye my love, maybe one day I will be able to return to you.""

Log 3: *The man is now a few years older, and that there are trillions of them. They say a lot of things... I didn't believe a word until I started seeing the bodies, burnt to a crisp, the skin where they got hit is burnt like... a marshmallow that is dropped into a fire. Their armor didn't do SHIT!

I've seen the casualties; I've talked to the soldiers. We won't win this war. All we can do is hope they don't find our planet.

I got put with Keyes, and... *One of the soldiers next to the man nudges him, ""Oh, shut the fuck up already? Can't you see that some of us are trying to concentrate""* Fuck off Jenkins, you know this is how I psych myself up.

Something far worse than the covenant. They are pure evil, because he wasn't human anymore. We just... put him down. The men say I am in charge now, but I don't feel like much of a leader. I guess I am just going to try to get them out of here... No matter what.

Diary Entry 421:

I can't believe this shit. 

A few months ago, we fucking manage to get through the first couple of galaxies fine. We stocked up on some weapons, and even though I advised he invest in some shielding or a defense drone, this nitwit believes a strong offense is the only type of defense. Eventually (I knew this would happen) we run across a Mantis patrol ship; if you're new to this universe, these cunts are usually armed to the teeth and this time they came at us with an array of missile-based weapons. They bombard the living shit out of us, and because my captain can't fucking think straight, he waits 30 goddamn minutes before turning on the engines to prepare the FTL jump. We barely. fucking. make it. Down to 10% of hull integrity and enough fires to cook a Crystal, we hit nothing (which I thought was a blessing at first, so they commission our moron of a captain to take 'em out. We're COMPLETELY out of missiles and drone parts

After a few hours we catch this ridiculous looking ship, and we watch it explode. 
Well, we do it again! Our captain, who just barely passes for literate, manages to destroy the other fucking third of this goddamn ship. AND IT STILL LIVES. At this point, I knew we were dead. We had 20% hull integrity, 5 missiles left, and had lost about half of our crew. It was me and two other schlubs stuck with manning the helm, shields

Somehow, but one last missile would take them out. And then... their Zoltan shields recharge. Which is normally impossible, but this cunt of a ship is apparently the baddest mother fucking thing in the universe. And a fucking breach missile makes it past our drone and drives straight into the hull. Our ship fucking explodes and the last thing I hear are the cries of the crew. 

Except... I didn't die. I was repairing the oxygen room at the time and because of my oh so lucky Zoltan-genetics, now I'm left here alone with my dumbass captain in the oxygen room wondering how the fuck we're going to survive floating in space. Well, at least we both got to enjoy the sight of our federation being annihilated; serves them right for putting this dumbass in charge. Why didn't I sign up with the Engis?

“What’s happened here?” She spoke louder than she intended to

By the Abbey

A grizzled guard strode forward. “I suppose the honest answer is ‘yes’

“Isn’t that blood?” 

The man nodded. “Aye

Her shoulders trembled again. Her heart was thumping wildly

“Then how is it nothing to be concerned about?” 

The puddle was the size of a serving tray. Whoever it was, a mechanical gesture that was more self-assuring than thirst-quenching. 

“It’s Lord Shaw’s blood. There was a contest of honor here not long ago. A duel.” 

Waverly’s ears perked up. 

“A duel?” 

He nodded again. 

“Aye

“Oh…” That made sense

There were those in the Estate District still whispering about the Opera House Incident, Lady Shaw had disappeared from her opera box, returning only moments before the curtain rose for the second act, looking distinctly ruffled and wearing a good deal less lipstick. In the dark, Lord Shaw watched his wife. 
Bored by endless arias, as Morgan and Custis couldn’t be bothered to go anywhere that wasn’t Parliament or the Golden Cat. Lord Shaw, a man descended from generations of soldiers, confronted the cad. Words had been exchanged on the street outside and, according to the looser gossiping tongues in Dunwall, so had blows. 

So Shaw had finally done something about the slander against his name and he had lost. Tragic

“And you say this was all done properly?” 

“Oh, all above-board. They was back to back until the count of three, turned and fired, and Lord Shaw fell. I was one of the seconds.” 

The furious beat of her heart had slowed considerably. A Gentleman’s Duel

Of course

She interrupted her own thought and looked at the blood pool once more

“Have someone come to wash this out right away. I don’t want it staining the grass.” 

“Right away

She turned and walked back up the stone stairs to the house. She sipped her wine again

The classical music wafted along the halls and the whale statues let out another burst of golden confetti as she entered. Guests milled around the table

“—found out he was this close to being a Weeper

“—absolutely burnt to the ground

“—just got sick in the Courtyard—” 

Waverly made her way to the table and selected a chocolate-covered strawberry. She pushed her mask up just a bit to take a bite of the intoxicating sweet. She closed her eyes and enjoyed the syrupy tang of berry juice coupled with the dark richness of the chocolate. She could feel her worries melting away. She had been acting rather a fool, her castle. 

There was a most uncouth scrape of glass against the wine fountain, pouring a goblet of wine down her throat. Worse still, her mask was perched high on her forehead, exposing her entire face. Nervous that someone might see and ruin the evening’s guessing game, Waverly rushed forward and plucked the glass out of Esma’s hand while yanking her mask back down. 

“What in Heaven’s name are you doing—” she hesitated

“Whass it look like I’m doin?” Esma slurred

“Well

Some of the partygoers were starting to look in their direction. Waverly threw an arm around Esma and began steering her towards the powder room. As she pulled her sister down the hall

“Hold on, looking back over her shoulder. 

“I know

The room was empty except for a woman at the vanity

“Out.” Waverly barked. “Now.” 

The swan-cow nodded and hid the snuff box somewhere in her bountiful décolletage. She rose from the chair and swiftly left the room
Esma let out another groan. Waverly flung her at the toilet. The black Lady Boyle yanked off her mask just as she began to retch

Waverly heard a rattling at the door. The brass knob was turning. Someone was trying to come in. She wedged her foot against the jamb

“Occupied

“Sister

It was Lydia. Waverly left Esma slumped at the basin and hurriedly opened the door to let the final Lady Boyle in

“What happened to her?” 

“What do you think?” Waverly was rapidly reaching the end of her rope. Playing hostess was difficult enough

Esma gurgled again and leaned forward. Waverly dug her fingers into Esma’s hair and pulled

“Do you think she even tastes it anymore?” she asked. 

“The drink or the sick?” 

“Either.” 

“Fugg you both

Waverly looked to Lydia. “It’s a good thing she’s wearing the black one. If she was wearing one of ours

Lydia tucked a stray lock of hair back up into her hat. “While we’re on the subject

“Oh? Was it Miss White?” 

“No, the woman has the secret-keeping abilities of an audiograph player. But my gentleman has been whispering honeyed words into my ear all night. Quite refreshing to hear after listening to some of these old geezers. All they do is complain about whale oil quarterly yields or something.” 

“Do we know him?” Waverly deposited Esma in one of the chairs and began dabbing at her face with a towel. 

“I don’t know. He hasn’t told me his name yet.” Lydia’s voice indicated she was entirely fine with her admirer remaining mysterious. 

“Well

“I think he’s a skeleton or something. He’s got a black cloak on and some kind of skull mask. I think he might be some version of the Angel of Death.” 

Waverly laughed derisively. “Sounds like you’ve found yourself a real catch

“And better still

“What

Lydia shrugged. “I don’t know. He has at least some musical talent. When I first saw him, but it was still wonderful to hear.” 

As happy as Waverly was for her sister

“Before you dash off to your mysterious musician, of course.” 

“Of course.” 

Lydia straightened up and adjusted her costume

“Has anyone come close to guessing which is which?” 

Waverly shook her head. “Only a few people have guessed who I am, nobody has guessed all three.” 

“Looks like the cameo stays with us.” 

She departed and Waverly locked the door behind her. Esma was spitting into the sink to get the taste out of her mouth. 

“There

The next knock on the door finally came and Waverly opened it to reveal a nervous-looking maid with a tray covered by a silver dome. 

“Hello, “I was told that you needed me?” 

“I don’t

As Sven got closer and was about to enter the house

“You all right elf?” he said

Faendal’s vision was a little blurry and he felt a trickle of blood on his brow. A mighty ache was starting in his head.

“I feel sick.” He said weakly.

Sven helped Faendal back to the Elf's house and propped him up in his bed. He fussed around finding a clean cloth and dampened it with some rain water. He applied it the wound on Faendal’s forehead. Faendal tried to frown but it just hurt his head more.

“Now don’t go thinking we are friends or what not, friend.” Sven stood up and was humming happily. He started to absent mindedly tidy up Faendal's house.

Faendal felt his heart break a little as he realised it was his own foolish actions that had thrown Camilla into Sven’s arms. It was the end of everything, no more stashing dead salmon in Sven’s lute; no more fun.

“I suppose you’ve started planning the wedding?” He asked moodily.

Sven had neatly stacked Faendal's plates and ordered his cheese wheels and was now sitting on the end of his bed polishing his tankards.

“I suppose so

“Sounds like it would have been a good one.” Faendal admitted.

“Yes

Sven stood up and put the tankards away.

Faendal noticed he did not look happy.

“What’s the matter?” he said

Sven turned to look at Faendal with his bruised face. His normally tidy white hair was messy and stained with blood. A strange thing was happening in his chest

“Well

“Miss what?” said Faendal

“You know.”

“What?”

“Us.” said Sven.

“Us?”

I woke up on the afternoon to get ready for my shift. I start my shift at dusk and guard the roofs until dawn. I met my wife, brown eyes and a thin chin. Marco, the younger of the two brothers, has light brown hair, like his mother, and green eyes. Neither my wife nor I has green eyes, which is why I fear that Marco.....isn't mine. I have always been aware of this, and I think Eleonora knows. I've never confronted her about this

This is how most days go. If the rest of the night goes as planned, and then return to Eleonora by dawn.  Most say that my days seem dull, but the view of the Venetian rooftops under the midnight stars is what always makes me come back.

It's easy to get lost in your thoughts while admiring the stars. I usually try to use these moments to find it in my heart to forgive Eleonora for not being faithful and giving birth to a bastard. I wish her no harm


It's soon to be dawn, and I can now see that the flying one was without a doubt the notorious assassin, Ezio Auditore.

I've spent my whole life living with my pack in the forest, sheep were fast, the rain was wet... Life was rough. At least, it used to be.

See, this fella shows up out of nowhere one day, and starts chopping down trees. Now we've got no shelter, so we were kinda mad. But he was big and scary, and if those guys from town were anything to learn from, he's got a giant robot hiding somewhere that will pop up out of nowhere and rip us a new one. So, we just sit back and let him do his thing.

Eventually he gets enough wood, and looks really cozy. I wanna go see what it's like inside, but my brothers keep telling me that he's dangerous, and he would kill me if I got too close to his sheep. I'm the cautious type, so I listened and stood my distance.

Over the days he's done some impressive work. He went into this hole in the ground near our pack, then saw us and started running over. We were scared, but brave. All our strongest males got in defensive position, and prepared for the worst.

But, pulled out some delicious-looking bones, and put them in a pile in front of us, then walked away. We were a bit skeptical at first, but after tasting them, they were delicious. We needed more, but were still too scared to approach him.

The same thing happened for the next couple of days. He would go into the hole for a while, we warmed up to him and welcomed him into our pack with open front legs. He came to us, strapped a grey band around out necks, and gave us each respective ""names"". He told us to follow him to his house, and build us a shack to keep us sheltered. It was way better than the trees were, and he used a soft wool for the floor that made for comfy sleep. He told us to stay here and rest, and to prepare for the night.

We stayed there

That night, where we we've never been. We've heard stories from other passing packs about monsters in the desert. Scary, green monsters that eat anything that moves. Giant spiders. Walking skeletons, avenging their delicious brethren. Tall, dark glowing men who move faster than anything we could ever imagine. They were all true.

After a vicious night of fighting

However, and told us to rest.

This went on every night for about a week, and Master even got better equipment.

He would have us attack anything in sight, he would congratulate all of us on our hard work and gave us a round of steaks.

Eventually, ""stay here, I'll be back soon"", and then went off chasing the pearls.

That was two months ago. We haven't seen him since.

His crops have grown and withered, though one of us have managed to get into Master's box and fetch some old rotten meat. That has fed us for a while, but we're running out.

after another week he had come over to the entrance way to my room in the dorm. leaning against the wall he smiled and said hello to me. he was really friendly, a dog, etc. and as a final joke i made him see everything in green. all this time he was smiling, nodding understandingly and patiently.. i thought to myself ""oh wow...now i feel bad"" and i decided to give him a small enchanted amulet i made the day before.

he started getting a bit dizzy and so he ended up sleeping for 24 hours in his room. during this time i sat beside his bed making sure he was fine. during this time i couldn't help but feel really bad, he asked if i wanted to go with him on adventure. i nodded and so we up and left.

he took me into a dwemer ruin, i felt overwhelmed, the more i looked at his strong-reliable-back, and his calming demeanor the more my heart tugged within me.

after doing a pilgrimage for our lady Azura

i met my new best friend Jordis who was his appointed housecarl. it was odd at first having a woman in the house but she was very strong and kind. we got along very well despite our different interests. it was around this time that he stopped bringing me along on adventures. i was fine with this because i knew our advenutres had to come to a halt. he was a Hlaalu and i'm of house Telvanni. i was just hoping that no one from back home would catch onto our marriage. and so i continued to study in our mansion. he would be gone for a few days at a time then take me out for dinner

...when the vampire attacks started he came to me one night and gave me an armored robe, and spoke secretive as if something only they would know.

i took my husband by the hand and led him to the bedroom and he put his armor away. i comforted him that night but he still never talks about what happened to me. he disappeared again the next morning while i was still asleep. for three weeks i once again never heard from him. one night he slipped into our bed room and sat at the desk. i woke up and i was surpised to see him. he asked for some food so i cooked him something and then told me to follow him.

we were on the road for a day and when we passed a great lake he showed me a beautiful mansion on the the hill, and two children. he had adopted children without telling me, and i still don't know the relationship he had with the two women. 

one told me that she was the steward of the place and she was recuited after sharing a drink and a brawl with my husband. the other was his housecarl that was  given to him by the jarl. i really didn't know what to think. so when he asked if i could move in with him here

he still comes by every week to visit me...but i really don't know what to do...he's not the same happy, and hurt i am...

    I now have time to tell you what I had seen that changed my world. We finally made our way to Dawnguard. Finding the treasure proved to be a challenge, because there were no beds, only coffins. I’d rather sleep on the floor, wrapped in troll intestines than in a coffin. As I said, we decided to build a fire in the dinning hall and make some food as our bodies grew hungry from our travels. We were reminiscing old adventures when I found a book next to a clan member’s chair. The velvet book had a splash of blood on the bottom corner and it had a strange vibration to it. I began to read it and I had found something incredible. The vampires, they where trying to open a doorway from “another world; a world that sat next to ours.” Then the book went on to talk about a man born from a dragon. I knew this was going be good, so I started to read it out loud to my thane. The book was in elvish
     “The moon will turn to ash        
      The spirit of our master will shine through the riptide    
      The world-walker is born with a dragon heart     
      What does it mean to have honor    
      When the earth is set ablaze"" I couldn’t help but laugh.     
      “What do you think these vampires were drinking? It wasn’t blood!” My thane grinned as he took another bite out of his skeever cake. The book started to vibrate even stronger the further we ate into our feast. Then a high pitched sound coursed through the castle. We had no idea where to give attention as we looked towards every inch of the hall. A blinding light tore through the air
      The man turned and stared down my thane. He walked towards him and extended his palms outwards to conjure two swords. I ran to give the armored man a taste of my Nord steel, I realized that some poison arrows would remedy our situation.
      My thane readied his shield and sword, picked him up by the shoulder, and drove his sword into his body. My thane screamed in agony, causing my heart to skip. I couldn’t bare to see him in this much pain, diary. So, I laid a couple of arrows into the armored man’s back. Thats when my thane set him ablaze with his thume. The armored man dropped the Dragonborn and tried to brush out the fire off his armor, but the poison was starting to act. He had to run outside to extinguish the flames
    We used up the last of our potions on our last endeavor, because I have some invisibility potions from one of our last treks to Riften. The pain in my lower chest is quite painful now, but there is no time for pain.    
    I will write again when we are safe.

1372125622.0,1h0dq1,(Skyrim): My Brother in Law: Part I,civaddicted,52,15,14,"In my life

The legionnaires marching north were always eager to loosen their purses on some trinket or another, but still a profitable turn of events. It's strange how profitable business always seems to create the most unusual of circumstances. 

And it is through an unusual business transaction that I found a brother in law. I'll never forget the first few times we met. He came running into town with Hadvar

He came into the store as I was ending her rant and I apologised to him for seeing the tiff. He shrugged telling me not to worry about it, he ""found"".

Opening his bag, topping it off with a dozen or so animal pelts. The blood still dripped warm. I bought it all for a small fee, knowing my contact in the stormcloak rebellion would gladly pay to have their supplies returned and the furs would do nicely for a new throw blanket for these cold winters.

I knew better than to ask where he ""found"" the armaments and didn't particularly care how he came about the skins. Gold in hand, asked him to give to her. I don't know what that testosterone deficient runt wrote her but it rubbed Camilla up the wrong way.

They chat for a while and now he's all ears for the golden claw, he's dreaming that if he can find it, Camilla would let him store his mage's staff in her master chest in gratitude!

Camilla offered to show him how to find the thieves lair but he declined, my father used a similar line when asked where he was sneaking off to drink at night, he would tell us he had ""business with the emperor"".

After he left I saw him ""rush off"" to his meeting with the Jarl. Obviously he first had to hold council with those sages of the nation, Camilla would see Faendal in a new light, especially since Sven was now out of the picture. It wasn't until that evening that it clicked what those two had schemed with the fake letter from Sven, I ,however, didn't rush to tell Camilla. As soon as Sven's bitch mother bit the dust he would've been clawing at Camilla's breeches. That Faendal on the other hand, would be afraid of Camilla saying no even if she were dead!

When he eventually left I thought that would be the last I ever saw of either him or Faendal, had other designs. 

A few weeks later Faendal returned to Riverwood, desiring an ""unexpected"" rendezvous with Camilla. He said they never managed to make that important meeting with the Jarl but instead went to Riften and Falkreath before Faendal was told to come back to Riverwood. 

I had all but forgot about this odd man and his promise to return the golden claw until a few months later

Camilla, as he wove his last stem, he proceeded to place the entire bouquet into his mouth and eat it. He spoke through petals and stems telling us, in complete seriousness, ""this is how the best alchemists in the world learn their craft""

He introduced his business partner Jenassa

He said he had become a thane of the Jarls of Whiterun

Waverly left the servant with the sister and rejoined the party.  With the Esma situation now in hand

Hours later

The regal lords and ladies bustled back into the immense space.  The long table was gone, the band launched into a Serkonian waltz, upbeat yet refined.

“I would say you look ravishing tonight, “But you’re dressed exactly the same as your sisters.”

She turned and faced the man in the whale mask.  She’d know that irritating jabber anywhere

“Congratulations, didn’t the invitation make it clear tonight is a costume party?”

“Hysterical as ever.  Shall we dance?”

He pulled her onto the floor before she could speak.  She nearly stumbled as they joined the whirling couples laughing to one another.  One of his hands rested itself on her waist with a familiarity she felt he did not deserve.

“Is there something I can do for you

“I wanted to talk to you.”

“I was afraid of that.”

“Just listen to me!”  He snapped.  As quickly as his tone had become acidic

“You mean you’ve finally decided to sell me Harkraven Hall?  I’m glad to hear it.  That would pay off a significant part of your debt

The music changed.  Ramsey bristled visibly at the mention of his ancestral home.  Of all the properties and assets he’d been selling her, Harkraven would be hers by the Month of Harvest.

“Actually

“Oh
She intentionally stepped on his foot just to throw him further off-balance.  Ramsey winced.

“I’m serious

“Much like my evening.”  She pushed him away and glanced at her watch.  “So sorry to cut this short

Ramsey’s shoulders slumped in disappointment.  Something in Waverly bristled.  A real man would’ve taken this sort of ribbing in stride.  It was his own fault he was in any sort of financial predicament.  But this exhibition of weakness

“You’ll raise the funds you owe me

If she had been able to see his face

“You’re a viper

He spun around on his heel and marched out of the room.  Waverly edged her way out of the dancing couples.  There were only fifteen minutes before the unmasking.  A maid with an empty tray caught her eye.  Waverly rushed over and clutched the girl’s arm.

“You there

The girl’s eyes widened in fear.  “Yes

“Good.  Bring her back down again.  Make sure she’s sober enough for the unmasking.  Have you seen Lydia?”

Wincing under her mistress’ tight grip

“Well

If possible

Waverly glanced in a few doors

With just moments to midnight

It was supposed to be a simple thing.  The three of them stood at strategic points in the room, and Lydia at the doorway to the dining room.  They would make a speech in unison, either praising a lucky winner and presenting them with the valuable Boyle cameo, or chastising their guests for their failure.  There was no winner.

Waverly stole one last peek at the grandfather clock.  It was time, she could see the maidservant fruitlessly scurrying from door to door with an increasing panic.  Waverly took a breath and folded her hands behind her back, the signal that the rhyme was about to begin.  She spoke on the first chime of midnight.

*“We the Boyle sisters three*

*Extend you every courtesy.*

*Our food you eat

*But have you stopped to have a think?*

*Each one of us has donned a mask*

*And given you a simple task.*

*Discover our identities*

*And do it with the greatest ease.*

*But since nobody on this night*

*Has gotten any answer right

*The masks come off

*Now who is who in this grand room?”*

In perfect unison and just in time with the final chime of twelve

“Thank you, we dance!”

The musicians raised their instruments and began playing a dignified Dunwall classic.  Partners found each other again and resumed dancing.  It was short-lived

A blood-curdling shriek echoed throughout the halls.  Everyone stopped and looked around.  Waverly saw the door to the music room open.  The maidservant

*No…*

  So Samantha and I left camp at 10 and we headed down to the crimson caravan company to trade supplies and check for work. Blake is an old buddy from when I was growing up in Oak Creek so he gives us a discount. Anyway
    
  We leave, I'm not convinced half of them even had the right ammunition in their shitty, duck taped, single-shot shotguns. These fiends were far from professional, obviously all hopped up on chems and cheap booze. The leader of the pack manages to sputter out something about a toll road, showing of his single digit yellow teeth. Normally, Samantha and I would have paid up and moved on but we were already desperate for caps. Stalling as best I could, rifles leveled.
""Oh Thank God!"" I thought to myself as Samantha and I immediately started to run to the patrol. They open fire, breaking the bone and leaving me momentarily paralyzed. My left hand was also peppered, unbeknownst to me at the time. I knew the patrol would end me if I stirred but I chanced a peak at Samantha, who was facedown in a puddle of her own blood. I restrained a sob as realization was graced upon me and silent tears sailed down the side of my dirty face, not from the physical pain but rather the emotional, a pain I would feel for the last time not because of the span of my life but because I had nothing left to feel. The NCR patrol poked around some, enough to scavenge the newly purchased rations and 10 millimeter ammo Samantha had on her

  The patrol shouldered their newly looted supplies and continued on. I scrambled toward Samantha with desperation, I cradled her head in my arms, cried out, cursing all above and below. Her lifeless eyes stared beyond me. I hopelessly tried to drag her back to camp, my mangled appendages allowed for no such thing. In defeat, I half crawled, half limped back to camp catching you up to speed. 

  Here I am, anyone and tell them what happened, get Blake to ID the supplies, get those troops a court marshal. But what is the point? None of that brings back Samantha, and I just don't care anymore. I have maybe 3 more hours until I bleed out, I hope God doesn't mind if I take the express lane. 

  To anyone reading this who has a shred of decency I am leaving all of my belongings to Blake who works at the Crimson Caravan Company

  To Blake

I love you Samantha.

What has it been? A week since the ""Green Flu"" became a national emergency? Maybe two weeks since the station got a story about patients with a new virus? Something like rabies they said. Has it been three days or four since Fairfield fell? How long since I watched those...things...those ""sick"" people swarm the gridlocked evacuation traffic

I wanted to help but I couldn't. I couldn't land, since none of the bases here in Pennsylvania are responding. There's a refugee camp there, but the soldiers there say everything is going to be shipped to the Gulf Coast by the end of the week. That means time is ticking for anyone left in the city.




This is my second run today, I don't think I can fly much longer. 

Right, seven of them, running down Cherry Street being chased by those things. I couldn't land right there to get them, the street was too cluttered with cars, not to mention the power lines. I told them over the PA to run for a parking lot two blocks down where I could land. Only six made it, and with the horde hot on their heels. One of those things though, it grabbed one of the survivors with its tongue. Like, like some kind of goddamned frog. The poor bastard was hanging on to the door for dear life, one of the things broke through my window and took a chunk out of my left arm. They ended up pulling that poor man off of the door





I feel hot, I will. So I just keep broadcasting, keep calling out into the storm. ""Mercy Hospital, are you there?"" over and over again. It's on a loop in my mind. If I'm not radioing Mercy, I'm on the PA saying the same thing over and over: ""To anyone who can hear this, proceed to Mercy Hospital for evacuation."" I'm starting to doubt anyone *can* hear this. I'm starting to doubt those four survivors I saw earlier made it to the hospital at all...





Wait! A voice! That's them! Alright, you owe it to these people. You owe it to all the others you couldn't help.

This guy's suit has a different number though, 21. Not to mention he was armed to the teeth &amp; had a Mohawk... If he wasn't wearing the suit, I'd have took him for a raider. 

The guy comes in and without saying anything just eats this weird ass meat pie Jas made, she didn't tell me it was free. I'd have ate it &amp; kept my damn rifle. I swore her asshole of a husband ran the register, haven't seen him in days. Anyway...

Then this guy heads over to the table &amp; I notice there was a star bottle cap right on the table, 10 bullet wounds, 5 scars &amp; 3 teeth just to get 6 of those damn caps. 6 more would've surely killed me.

I must have been out of my mind to follow him in here, shooting up psycho with one hand &amp; firing a grenade launcher with the other... It's amazing he could even, stand or see straight, let alone fire his weapon. Legion guys are charging at him &amp; the Deathclaws with machetes, brush guns &amp; sub machine-guns.

Who are we? Well, woman and child against those who would take it from them. Our enemy may be any ""leader"" who misuse their power, or any other that would deprive people of their humanity, but most of these are one of our nemesis: the Templars.


By now you are probably asking ""How in the world did I, join such a mysterious group?"". Well then, here is my story:



I grew up here in Rome, my younger brother and my uncle who worked as a tailor. 


When the Borgias took the power of Rome, my uncle resisted and was therefor killed by the guards. My brother and I swore that we would have justice, so we did what we thought was a great plan. As carpenters, we obviously had no experience in planning a war, so we assumed that if we outnumbered the guards in one sector, we would inspire others to join us and could together push towards the Vatican to drive out the Borgias.

My heart is heavy when I think of that day. We approached a group of four guards on the Aventine. We had brought 15 men, rage and disgust as he took of the saliva from where the apple had hit him. Then the fight was on. They were armed with swords, most of us were armed with knives, some used hammers and other tools, some were unarmed. We brought down two easily, but then they got reinforcement. They were now 13 guards, some with plate armor and two-handed swords. We called a retreat, a fast decapitation. They were about to kill me too, surrounded by guards. Suddenly, and he said ""The liberation of Roma has begun"". ""If I can help others as you have helped me


During the following months I learned more than a normal man learns during a lifetime. I learned how to kill a man with grace

After three months, London, Paris and many more places. We did everything from stealing documents to killing major targets. At first I was enraged because it had nothing to do with liberating Rome, but then I opened my eyes and saw that destroying any Templar influence is important for us to liberate Rome.

A month ago, and I performed the traditional leap of faith. I was now an assassin.


Now, and I will have my vengeance. I can hear Ezio shouting together with the other high ranked assassins, like La Volpe and Machiavelli. I can hear a whistle, I shall now join my master. 

I leap from the rooftop, I will protect him.


The battle is over, a sword impaled me in the back, and I'm dying. I can see Cesare being dragged away, and I'm smiling. Rome is free now, just as it should be. I have no regrets, I am proud to die today.

1361533303.0,190lrc,[Deus Ex] Met the new nano-augmented agent. What a cunt.,benmuzz,36,6,1,"Now I knew Denton mark II had a bad rep. It was his first operation and I'd already got word from the lads outside that he was being a dick

ANYWAY, I was still willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Honestly, I was actually quite excited to see him. I kind of looked up to his brother when I joined the coalition, and I was pretty honoured to be on duty in the corridor by his office because I knew I'd get to see him. 

So a bit later he comes down. He ignores me at first, it's horrific to see someone lose control like that, but I stayed at my post because...well, I'm a soldier. 

Then he *picked up a sofa*. A huge leather sofa, slamming me against the wall. I was winded and bleeding from my stomach. I didn't know what to say, I was so shocked I just blurted out ""stop that"". But then he just stared at me, like he was fucking brain dead. He seemed to have no idea that what he'd done was insane. But he just kept staring at me and then raised his eyebrows as if I should speak. What the fuck do you say to someone like that?? I just sarcastically said ""good job sir""...saying anything else to a psychopath like that could have provoked him to violence and as he'd fractured most of my ribs with his furniture attack I was in no position to fight. I was waiting for him to reply, to apologise... fucking respond in any way, basically... but nope. Instead, he ran into the conference room, it's the one where we keep the flare darts for emergencies. He tried to get in but we have a tiny padlock on it for health and safety reasons. I was about to ask him if he wanted the key, metal and concrete that came flying out of that room into the corridor. I was deafened and disorientated from the explosion and the rubble that had fallen on me

I staggered on to my knees, into Manderley's secretary's office, where I passed out. Fuck that guy.

1360310140.0,184e6v,[Dead Space 2] A Business Man,Hugs_of_Moose,41,10,3,"I… I don’t know what to do. I’m a business man, every cell in me frozen. My mind seemed to be twisting in on its self from exposure to such an instant upheaval of reality. It was searching for an explanation, taking down whoever was unlucky enough to be within reach of their dreadful blades of bone and flesh. 

I looked down again at the girl, the only place my feet seemed willing to take me.

Running down the blood drenched corridors of that city was surreal. It was as if someone had taken a planetary-sized shipment of paint and started spraying it with a hose on every surface. In the consumer district the doorways and windows of restaurants and shops where piled with bodies. As I ran past these places I’d occasionally slip in pools of blood which had made the metallic ground slick. 

I had almost reached the elevator that would take me from the consumer district to my apartment complex when I noticed something that even now perturbs me. The area was deserted. I was the only living being, window to window, all drenched in red and filled with bodies. In the distance I could hear more people fall to the beasts, and yet here I was, in the most heavily populated area in this sector of the station, absolutely alone. I just stood there; my mind slowly began to twist again. It felt as though I was back at the office, staring at the intern girl being ripped apart by the beasts. I could see her clearly before me, each lunge of its blades piercing her side only to have the wound healed the moment the blade left her body; every appendage torn off her fragile figure instantly reattaching only to be torn off again. The beast seemed joyful for having found a companion to perpetually slaughter.

Then I heard a bird. Than another, such beautiful creatures crows are. I was brought back to text books I had read as child about the forests of Earth, though I had never actually seen one myself. I had been breed and raised for the city, business was my game, even at a young age, and I never had time for such distractions; though I had always been curious. Eventually I turned, and expecting to see trees my mind completely twisted in on its self upon the sight I beheld instead. I could not understand why the crows looked and behaved so strangely. It was as if they were made of flesh and shaped like two wings without a body. They flew from corpse to corpse, and drop it again; moving on to the next corpse
 
These were no crows

One approached me, this time the beast that was over her had a much more human face. The bird crept closer to me, and closer yet, until I could make out the image of the beasts on its wings. It was me. My hands knew nothing but the feeling of warm blood washing down the blades that had replaced my arms. My mind knew nothing but the sweet serenity of oneness with those whose bodies had been perfected along with mine. 

The dove was upon me, but only the fleshy monster wrapping its self around my head, blood drenched tentacles attempting to force me to submit. 

My hands clawed at the fleshy creature; however, after having thought over the event many times, I do not know what strength of mind possessed me to continue to fight the creature's grasp. There was no hope and I knew it just as much as I know it now. But everything in me fought, almost to the death. 

A bright blast of energy exploded through my fleshy mask, picked me up by the arm and yelled at me to run for it. He took off for the elevator, leaving me shell shocked. I looked down the streets of the district and saw just how many of these beasts had been created, and how many more were still to come. I turned toward the elevator and saw him beckoning for me to join him. I ran the few blocks I had left and gazed backwards, only half-aware, at the hundreds of beasts coming our way.

The doors closed and I pushed the button that would take me to my floor. I looked at the engineer; he was having a frantic conversation with someone, but a noble quest none the less.

 I did not speak for fear of interrupting his conversation and train of thought. Once the elevator reached my floor I got off. The engineer stayed behind

I made my way to my apartment, and even though the other side of the door has food; I’m too sick to eat. I’m lonely, and even though the other side of that door has pictures of me and an intern girl, who I raised from birth, who I watched grow up; I’m too heartbroken to remember any of it.

The wind brushed my hair out of my face, I had a horse, and I had an adventure waiting to unfold before my feet.

Suddenly, and then I continued on, wary and with all the leaves blown back in my face, though not a hint of wind played at the tops of the trees. 

""Just a rabbit in the bushes, I kicked at the horse's sides and continued my journey, scanning the sides of the road as I went. I led him around the bend in the road and nearly cried out when a dozen soldiers in blue seemed to appear in the clearing in front of me. Stormcloaks!

""Move along traveller. You're interfering with official business

I couldn't get out of there fast enough. All of those swords made me nervous. Just as I turned around, stepped out from the surrounding shadows. A clattering noise came from the road behind me, and a tall, gray-haired man led a column of Imperial troops into the clearing. The Stormcloaks drew swords and made a protective circle around a man in expensive clothes. 

""Drop your weapons

There was no sound from the Stormcloaks

""He's right. Lay down your arms, and the Stormcloaks put down their swords without protest.

""Bind them."" The tall man ordered. And I let myself be bound. What choice did I have?

I was shoved roughly onto a cart with a tall blond warrior, with a nasty looking gash above their ear. The blond Nord had been watching me closely.

""That horse you were riding; it wasn't yours

I looked away, stupid brother was born this wouldn't have happened. I wanted to cry, but that would only prove the bastard right.

The other on the cart stirred. About time. The Nord looked over at them. 

""Hey, same as us, and that thief over there.""

Oh, now I'm admitting I stole the horse. I turned to the other one, probably the only thing in the cart that wasn't already against me. ""You there. You and me - we shouldn't be here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.""

""We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, now wearing a gag. ""And what's wrong with him, huh?""

""Watch your tongue

Realization dawned

The Nord stared up at the sky. ""I don't know where we're going

No. No no no no. ""No

The Nord looked down and met my eyes. ""Hey

I scowled. ""Why do you care?"" It's not like anyone else gives a skeever tail about what happens to me.

""A Nord's last thoughts should be of home""

He was right. Not all of my memories were bad ones. This is my homeland

The carriage pulled up at a walled city, now riding a horse in front of the caravan.

""General Tullius

I finally found the faith my mother had wanted my to so badly. ""Shor, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me.""

The Nord muttered something about elves, dragons attacking? ""Why are we stopping?""

The Nord looked over. ""Why do you think? End of the line. Let's go. Shouldn't keep the gods waiting.""

I couldn't help myself. ""No! Wait! We're not rebels!""

""Face your death with some courage

Nobody listened. The Nord's name was Ralof. He was from Riverwood

So I ran. I ran as fast as I could with my hands bound in front of me. The Imperial captain shouted. ""Halt!""

 I don't think so. ""You're not going to kill me!"" I shouted back.

1364084387.0,1avz1v,[Skyrim] A Guard's Tale: Part 3 The Prisoner Returns,Little_but_Fierce,44,15,14,"“You’re joking.” I said to Heric.


I was in Belethor’s shop trying to get him to talk about Skooma manufacture in the ‘Run. Caius had declared a crack down on the drug and was on a mission to ‘clean-up’ the city; the rest of us hadn’t even known there was a problem. I mean really


Caius was convinced the Cats were involved but needed firm evidence in order to raid them the next time the caravan came. Apparently the Jarl had insisted he could only proceed with documented proof


Heric had been on Draggers duty (as we called Dragonsreach – though not within the Jarl’s earshot) and got to listen in to Balgruuf carving Caius a new Briar’s heart - as Heric put it. It seemed the Jarl felt with the Civil War at a delicate stage, with terms.


So I’d been sent to interview Belly. Now, but you get my point. He might sell you his sister, his brother, his wife and his children (if he had any) but he was no snitch. And the man could talk the skin off a salmon so currently I was in possession of a not so new clothes iron, which I didn’t need and had purchased at an apparently bargain price. I blamed Caius and decided he’d be getting it for his next cake-day - but with my luck he’d probably like it. So you couldn’t say I’d come away empty-handed, but I would be reporting that Belly knew nothing.


Heric had burst in half-way between Belly trying to foist another ‘treasure’ on me, especially as he fell over Siggy on the way in. I pulled Heric up and dragged him outside as the shop boy untangled himself from his broom and before Belly was able to burden me with more junk. I hauled Heric over to Roddy - or was it Jon, no matter.


“Roddy


“It’s true, fetched out of his pockets, well he turned up bold as a bare-arsed bandit and walked straight up to the gate, where the twins nabbed him, account of his bounty still being active, you know over that sweet roll thing in the inn, and also the fighting ...”


“The point


“All right, I don’t know, I swear he had more stuff on him than the last time, Luna, you’d be glad you didn’t have to...”


“Grrrrwl” Roddy rumbled.


Heric continued “... and quick as you like he headed straight back into Draggers to see the Jarl.”


“The Jarl?” I said.


“Yes. The Jarl. You know


“I know the Jarl Heric.”


“Course you do. And Farengar was all excited too.”


“Farengar?”


“Yes. The Court Wizard. You know. Farengar.” Heric stated.


“I know Farengar


“Why’d you ask then?”


“Heric!” I was about to smack his helmet


“That looked like...” Heric said.


“Jon the Black


“What’s going on?” I said. 


We debated a moment and I went down to the gate from where the guard had come


Jon the Red was on duty and was agitated to say the least. He had his steel sword out


“Jon what’s going on? We saw Jon – the other Jon


“Dragon’s, and I’m not allowed to leave my Daedra-cursed post.”


My mouth went dry. A dragon at Helgen was one thing, or rather, half-hoped it wasn’t true.


None of us had fought, well the Divines only knew what it could do to the Western Watchtower. 


“Who is out there?” I said to Jon. The Western was on the gate barracks roster this week.


“Um, Tor ... ”


“I’m going down there.” Jon grabbed me, don’t. Not without orders. Caius would...”


“Cauis can kiss skeever butt.” I said.


Before I could wrestle away from him


Irileth was running towards us with a small group of Dragonsreach guards and that funny little prisoner in the lead


Irileth and the guards stopped at the barracks but the prisoner flashed past us with a happy grin and ran on through the gate. The guards looked reluctant and Irileth was having to give them a rousing ‘Let’s go kill us a Dragon’ speech. 

I struggled in Jon’s grip but he held me firm


“No


“But Loki. What about Loki.”


“Loki can take care of himself.”


Irileth had worked up the guards and they were finally heading through the gate.


“At least to the ramparts


“Okay, no further. And if it comes this way, you come back in and defend the city. THAT’s your job.” Jon said.


“Okay


I sped past the twins who were standing alert with iron swords at the ready and Whitrun shields raised. They were a silly pair but no-one could beat them on slash and bash.


I ran to my spot and looked towards the tower. The day was sunny and warm. It was a very pretty day in the ‘Run, a giant skeever with wings? A flying Argonian breathing fire? I saw Irileth and her band disappear around a bend in the road.


And then, a swooping, dark, dangerous and definitely dragon-shaped shadow was circling the Western Watchtower. I automatically pulled out my sword, as useless as I was so far away.


There was a dragon, it could be nothing else. I heard a distant roar and saw the bright torrent of fire blasting from its mouth. I imagined I could feel the searing heat.


I asked myself

    The most amazing thing happened to us. On this day, past Riften, to check for the loot he left behind on his recent quest. Dawnguard is full of weapons and coins that will aid our future pilgrimages. We made our way through the snow filled forest when my thane stopped us. I asked him, “what do you see?” He just peered left to right. I could only hear the wind blowing through the branches and the snow slapping our cold steel, but the Dragonborn knew better. He readied his incinerate spell and fired a shot into the frozen forest. We waited to see if anything would respond, but there was only silence. It was then, a vampire jumped out of the trees and ran for us. You could hear the clanking of his armor as he rushed. I knew that arrows would only bounce off that armor of his. So, but it was too swift. It tackled him to the ground, for buckets of blood spilled all over the ground. The mist raised as the Dragonborn had his way. Thats when we heard something in the distance.    
    My thane told me stories about these creatures,” he said to us with his brash attitude. He stood in front of us naked in the elements as he said, “you know we came here to feed on him, but he is cold and lifeless now. Such a shame, I think you two will provide a better meal.” Two red glowing eyes then appeared next to the man and my thane pulled me back behind him. He then started to erupt in laughter and I readied my bow. I raised my weapon and pulled back an arrow, as his laughter turned to screaming. His eyes turned red and his forearms split open like a banana. It wasn’t just his arms, but his legs and chest split open as well. Fur branched out of his body and his face erupted into hair and teeth. I have never seen such a sight, howling before their kill. The Dragonborn turned and looked into my eyes. He said to me as he pulled off his shield
    I nodded, so I stood over the beast and beat its head in with my shield. It stubbled through the snow as I reared my steel back and took its head. I turned to look back to hear more howling as my thane was burning the other to dust. You could smell the cooked meat as the wind blew through.    
    I looked for the leader, but we came up with nil. We decided to move on to Dawnguard to retrieve our spoils. I feel we should have found him, but it is senseless to spend precious resources on something you cannot find out in the wild. I fear that isn’t the last we will see of him. This isn’t even the good part I mentioned earlier. I must leave now, though. For duty calls.    
    Until next time.

""Face down, however, managed to escape multiple times. I got into crime some years ago, I sopped counting. Once you got into and used to it, time does not matter. You just live for job by job. You either dedicate yourself to one of the big guys or work as a kind of freelancer. I am the latter. It gives you enough freedom and variety in jobs and you don't feel like you're the bitch of someone. The longer you work for one guy, the higher the possibilty that he wants to get rid of you. I heard no one of Two-Face's guys makes it longer than 3 months. Then again he is a nutcase who makes his decisions by coin.


However why I got into crime scene is kind of tragic. I'm not talking about it to anyone because it makes me look weak. But the truth is, your light and you would give up anything just to make her smile, because you know she deserves it. But you are a poor good for nothing, a rat, you don't deserve to walk on the same ground as her, let alone talking to her. But you can change that. It just needs one guy that offers you and intriguing job. It's easy. You just help out for one night and you make a freaking fortune. At least that was how it was supposed to be.

All because of her. I don't know what she's up to ever since. I haven't seen her in years, in Arkham City, and I have to find a way to get out to fulfill my plan. I don't even know who I was working for right now. I don't know why I am beating up this man in front of my feet. But that doesn't matter any way.

When I arrived at the scene, not wanting to get in any conversation and just do the job. Suddenly the door from the theatre swings open. I slightly looked up, still in thoughts. Then I saw her. My eyes teared up with small tears. ""Harlene..."", I mumbled. ""Aaaaaaalright you funny faces, Mr. J was absolute clear about his orders. You guys are the bait. Batman will try to come in here, and this is the only entrance. So he will have to get past you aaaand..uuuuh...probably beat some of you up real bad. But that's life okay dokay?

""Yes...long time no see. How are you?"" She hesitated. It seemed she didn't know how to react. Maybe she didn't wanted to show affection to the minions of her boss?

Batman landed right in front of us. The shootings had stopped. I looked up only to see that all of the sniper squad had been rendered harmless. Batman sure is a tough number. Suddenly Batman took a sprint right at our direction. I was frozen I dunno what to do. Then I felt Harlene's hand on my shoulder. I looked behind me. She just smiled. Though it was a smile I had never seen before. ""Sorry!"" she said as cheerish as possible. She pushed me towards the running Batman. I stumbled forward and Batman was forced to slow down. He raised his hand to land a full punch on me again. Then a loud noise. But it drowned in the rush of blood that shot through my head right now. Adrenalin pumping through me. And then the cold and bitter reality of pain that overcame me. I looked down at me. A gaping small hole in my chest. Blood coming out of it relentlessly. Before me

""Gotcha!""

1363751258.0,1an5ae,[Skyrim] A Guard's Tale: Pt 2. The Mare and the Map.,Little_but_Fierce,34,8,10,"Commander Caius shouted at each of us in turn and then all over again when he discovered the prisoner’s gear was also gone. Jordic received special attention as he’d admitted he’d searched the prisoner and must have missed a lock-pick. We’d seen the scratches on the grate’s lock and realised this was how he'd made his escape. 

It was unfortunate, none of us would have wanted to look *there*. Cauis finally dismissed us with an angry grunt and went off to write his report.  

Luckily my shift was up so I got to escape the gloomy mood that had descended over the guards. I took off my cuirass and swapped my leather boots for more comfortable fur shoes

So I’d taken it to Adrienne and she’d fashioned me some soft leather padding stuffed with the cotton
 
It was well dark by the time I headed out of the barracks

I’d swapped the map to my pants pocket, expecting it to be overly patronised by my colleagues, but these days they hardly ever went there. 

It wasn’t the food, no matter whose it was. So he’d banned us from going there to eat or drink while in uniform.  And considering some of them lived in their cuirasses, well they just ended up turning the barracks into their own little tavern, giving me a break from their company when I visited the Mare.

Sinmir was never a problem, you’ll know it ain’t big and he’d end up by Uthgerd. I’d imagine him complaining about the guard and her complaining about the Companions and figure they were Mara-made for each other if only they could see it.

I came round into the square and gave a brief wave to Hrodgar. He stood on watch, still as a guardian stone. They joked about how he was likely asleep, and one day they’d stick a bucket on his head to prove it.  But I knew he had eyes in the back of his helm, friends in barrow-low places and missed nothing.  He also liked to secretly switch with Jon the Red, not to be confused with Jon the Black, named as to the colour of their hair, who was the same build as Roddy

I walked into the Mare and Mikael was raucously well into Ragnar the Red.  He swears he's trained in the Bard’s college, (and only once), as I took his sensitive parts in a firm grip, (not the pleasant kind) and asked him how he’d like to share a cell with a dead body for a couple of days. And he has behaved like the gentleman he’s not ever since.

The Inn was full as a bandit’s box and the only free seat was next to Ysolda. I smiled politely and sat down. She smiled politely back. I didn’t know her well and though most talked kindly of her

I didn’t want to get the map out in front of her so I just sat and listened to the music.  Saadia came over and was her usual brusque self

She’d admitted to me once, but she’d bustled off when Hulda had called her to clean up some mess. I didn’t know her background, but she had a scar on her face uglier than a skeever’s smile and I wondered how she’d come by it.

As I was now just about the only guard who frequented the place

I could feel the folded paper through my pocket and was itching to have a good look at it. So I skulled my ale and quickly ate my Eider topped potatoes.  The whole Inn was now singing along to The Age of Aggression and the noise was abysmal. Olfrid was closest to me

I gave my plate one last wipe and slipped out the door

The night was a bright one. A moon was large and full above the town, hoping they’d give him a job. I’d tried to get him to come with me and join the Whiterun guard, but he was determinedly loyal.

The air outside was cool and fresh; though after my childhood some nights still felt warm in Whiterun.  Not that I missed my home town’s weather; especially the thick grey fog slipping in from the swamp. As a child I’d had nightmares of vampires floating out of the mist

I was headed to a spot outside, past the stables, past the farms and the Western watchtower, and I fancied you could count the toes on a giant by the light of their fire at Sleeping Tree Camp. It was one of my favourite places to sit think late of an evening. Tonight the braziers were stacked high, the moon bright and the sky clear, so I reckoned it would be the perfect place to check out the map.

 “Watch the skies, but his pranks with cheese wheels and pitchforks were legendary - hence his nickname Loki. But the truth was even *he* was a bit nervy about the possibility of dragons coming back. 

“Not going far Loki, never mind a hulking great dragon flying across the sky.”  He muttered under his helmet. “And if I see even a hawk’s *shadow* I will be back in here faster than you can say “Hail Sithis.” I winked and he chuckled opening the gate for me.

The twins were guarding the other side and giggling as usual

Oh! And here's Shining Ebony [Part I

But before that, /u/Dragonsword, like I promised. He had a very sad story about how Skyrim has impacted his life, and I told him that I would give him a shoutout.

Now
______

**Shining Ebony Part III** ^by ^/u/MasterSiegfried

""Aisha! Aisha!"" Siris yelled as he rushed through the crowd of soldiers.

Siris then saw her. She seemed had changed over the years since he left the ship nine years ago. He rubbed his eyes to make sure he wasn't imagining her presence.

""Aisha

""Yes it is me

The two embraced each other as the soldiers cheered even louder than before.
_________

Siris discussed what had happened with Aisha about what had happened over the last nine years in his new

""How did you end up here?"" Siris asked.

""Two years ago, so we had to land in Hegathe. A year ago, Hegathe was attacked by the Dominion's navy, but were fended off by the army. After that, the majority of the Redguards were ushered into the army. I felt like it was logical to sign up as well, so here I am. My unit wasn't assigned to the battle at Elinhir, but I heard your name and how you climbed up the ladder and dropped the drawbridge. Pretty heroic I'll say. So

Siris stood up

""What is it?"" Aisha asked.

""They... they killed him.""

""Who?""

""My father... Those damn elves killed my father. That is why I'm here.""

""I... I'm sorry... I didn't know.""

""It's alright. I'll kill them, ""How's the Hawk doing.""

""Oh... That scoundrel fell off the crow's nest and died four years ago. It was strange. We don't know if it was suicide

""That's sad. I was looking forward to seeing him again. Poor guy.""

""Yeah

Silian Siallo stepped into the tent.

""Hello, I am Silian Siallo, and you are?""

""Aisha.""

""Ah

""He already told me what happened to him

""It was quite sad. But... it will be fine... There are some things you just can't change no matter how hard you try.""

Siris picked up his blade and started brandishing it.

""His death will not go unanswered

""Siris, Nords, even other Blades, who have fallen due to arrogance, selfishness, and seeking vengeance for wrongs done unto them. Not one of these types of people I've met have received a good and noble death. Always look to your father for guidance, but do not seek vengeance

With that, he turned his head and said,

""By the way Siris

And he left Siris' quarters.
________

After that day, but it was quite obvious that Siris had skill in battle and knowledge of the battlefield. A few soldiers were even bold enough to challenge him to a practice duel, and were subsequently beat to submission one by one.

Aisha stayed by Siris' side. The generals allowed her to fight in his unit. Aisha, she would charge into battle dual-wielding scimitars. One time, as Siris' unit was fighting against a small patrol of elves, Siris was fending off two elven swordsmen. He sliced one of their necks with the edge of his shield, but the other brought his sword crashing down to split Siris' helm when Aisha threw a scimitar into the skull of the elf.

""You owe me one

Silian Siallo also proved to be a fine warrior. He was old

But

After his first year of fighting in Hammerfell's army, but an inspiration, a hero. He was the Ebony Warrior. The other captains agreed as well as the generals and so Siris was made a captain. The day after this decision was made, however, an elf was seen over the horizon.

This elf walked with four others towards the camp.

*""Only four?""* Siris thought to himself as the rest of the soldiers grabbed their weapons and started moving towards them. Almost instantaneously
________

The generals

""I challenge the Ebony Warrior to a duel!"" The Altmer said.

""What purpose do you have for that?"" one of the Redguard captains asked

""We believe that that man is a key asset to the war. If this is so, why not just simply do the job myself, me against him, in a completely just way.""

""I can take him

""Siris,"" said one of the commanders.

""I am choosing to fight him... I know I can do this.""

""Foolishness and pride will not win you a battle, let him fight the elf.""

Siris and the elven commander were both positioned in a squared arena. This time, but instead, the elf immediately charged at Siris with his sword. 

Siris swung his sword and immediately disarmed the high elf. Before he could strike again,

""I'm no fan of your army's petty weapons.""

He formed a magical ball of flame in his hand and hurled it towards his opponent. The Ebony Warrior threw himself to the ground to avoid the incoming explosion of fire. He quickly jumped back up as the elf attempted to finish his foe and parried the incoming attack. The two continued to swing their swords and parry each other's attacks. For an elf

The Redguards laughed and shouted at the elf for using his magic to help him win the battle as Siris evaded fiery, and in its place he formed two bound daggers, and began striking at Siris like a snake. Siris parried multiple times, pushed the elf back...

and threw his sword and shield to the ground.

""What!"" yelled the elf, but I will cut him to the ground like the worm he...""

""FUS RO DAH!""

The same wave of energy that had erupted from his mouth constrained the elf to the ground,

""What... What power have you conjured? What magic is this that we have not attained? By the Aldmeri gods... Could it be... the Thu'um?""

Siris grabbed the elf by the collar of his shirt and said

The elf looked at him through the visor of his ebony helmet

""Ha... Hah... A powerful voice is nothing compared to the power of the Aldmeri Dominion. We will crush your armies... as we have done with with the Empire and we will take... a hold of your lands. When our general... Telindil

Siris stood up and walked away from the elf who lay crushed on the ground.

""By the way

Siris turned his head. He walked back towards the elf who lay on the ground. He raised his foot...

And crushed the head of the elf.

The three elves who were protecting the commander rushed into the arena to kill the warrior who had disgraced their commander. Aisha rushed in between the two sides and pointed her scimitars at the elven soldiers.

""Enough, and if you wish to lose your lives as well, I advise you to rush right into my swords. Or... If you would rather keep your lives, go tell your general, Telindil, about what has transpired here. Make your move.""

The elves looked around and saw that there was no way out. They sheathed their weapons and left

The soldiers started cheering once again for the Ebony Warrior. Amidst the noise

Silian merely nodded his head in disapproval... and left the crowd.

That is the end of part three! Siris' (or should I say the Ebony Warrior's) story shall continue as long as I'm breathing (and no school related, injury related ((especially finger-tip related injuries)), house-cleaning related, mind related, uninspirational moment related, sport related, time training one handed related, or world apocalypse related issues come up).

Adrian picked up the small child

""Siris

Isra looked at her husband

""Take care of him,

""Siris... Siris... Wake up

""Uh... Aisha

""Well

""Sure

""Uggh! get up silly

""Fine

Siris dressed and the two snuck as quietly as they could past Siris' sleeping father

Once they were outside

""Hey! What are you two doing!"" yelled the Hawk. The children never remembered his name, Hawk, and the name simply stuck with the rest of the crew. He was a nice fellow, and the two sometimes kept him company when he wasn't in the crow's nest.

""We weren't going to touch it

""Frankly, I think I'll let it pass this time. Just don't let me catch you two ten-year-olds near the wheel again. If the ship were to change course, I think I would be banished to Oblivion, or worse... I would have to deal with the captain."" 

The three laughed.

""Don't worry, ""we won't go near it again.""

""Actually, kids.""

Hawk then scampered up the net to the crow's nest in fear that someone would catch him off his post.

Aisha walked over to the front of the ship. She looked at Siris and said

""You know

She didn't finish her sentence because she slipped.

""Ahhh!"" She yelled as she fell.

Luckily, but his arms didn't seem to be strong enough to pull her up.

""Pull me up!"" she yelled.
 
Siris slowly pulled her up and she grabbed the ledge. Aisha climbed on top of the ship and lay down

""Thank you

""Yeah?""

""Can we not talk about this to your father

""Sure.""

The two then watched as the sun appeared to rise over the sea.

""Land Ho!"" Hawk yelled

Adrian then appeared from the decks and walked up to Siris

""Siris
___________

A few hours later

""Do you really have to go?"" Aisha asked Siris.

""I guess, and carriage to some place called Dragonstar. He said we're living in a house outside the city.""

""Well

Aisha handed Siris a necklace. There was a shell attached to it. The shell was white with several rigid

""Where did this come from?""

""I found it. I found it under one of the barrels the other sailors moved a few days ago. If you wear it

""Thanks Aisha...  I'll never

""I won't forget you either
___________

Adrian and his son moved into a small house on the outskirts of Dragonstar. Every week, a raise in the prices in the markets, tales of Wereboars, or even news of the Great War beginning, Siris would always inform his father. 

Every day

Seven years after Siris and his father left the ship, yelling, ""How could they do this! How could our emperor do this to us! We have to continue the fight, not bow down to the elves!""

""Actually, ""we're still at war with them.""

""Well it seems not everything is lost.""

""Do you think I can join the army?""

""No son, but we've got to stay out of it for now. Ive got to watch you as well. It would be what your mother wanted. Right now, we'll let events play out.""

Two years passed, for he recognized the name being called. 

It was his own.

The yell came from an older

""I'm Siris

""Wait, ""yes, you have your mother's eyes.""

""Wait

""I don't have time to explain. I just know that you and your father are in danger. Take this key

""Wait.""

""And this sword.""

""What?""

""Now run

Siris ran and pushed his way through the crowd without looking back at the Imperial. He ran as fast as he could back to his home.

And he saw what had happened.

The house was aflame. Almost everything was gone. Siris readied his sword

""Thalmor

He then looked over to his side

and to his horror

Saw his father, and burned.

Siris knelt to the ground and wept. He didn't know what happened

Siris used the key and entered a large cavern. There were weapons and shields around,

*Siris... This is your father, however, that means that I'm most likely dead. Maybe you already know, maybe you don't.*

*Son

*We were entrusted with the lives of the Septim emperors. We were to keep them safe from harm. As you know, the Thalmor have been hunting us. Many of my friends and colleagues have been slaughtered by those damn elves, and now I most likely am too.*

*Son... Siris... I want you to fight in the war against the Aldmeri Dominion. I want you to avenge me

*I love you

*Your loving father

*Adrian*

And at the bottom of the note lay three symbols

*These are words are written in dragon... They mean Fus... Ro... and Dah.*


Then Siris, armor, boots, and gauntlets, and a bow and sword placed above it...

...all crafted in Ebony.

_______

Once the elven commander's former bodyguards returned from the ""negotiation

""General Telindil

Without faltering from his current task,

""Where is the commander?... Was he victorious?""

""No sir

""Figures... I didn't expect him to live... He was so insistent on fighting the Ebony Warrior that it got to him... There is no real loss

""It seems the Warrior was able to... um... use a form of magic... with his voice... a shout more than anything.""

Telindil stopped for a moment

""So the Redguards have mastered the Thu'um?""

""The only Redguard we know of that can do this is this Ebony Warrior. But

""And how does that matter? I've killed more Blades than I can count.""

""He's the son of Adrian.""

Telindil stayed his hand. He dropped his pen, turned his elven body, and stared at the former bodyguard. He was still shrouded in darkness but his eyes shone yellow.

""He taught him the words... The words of power that Adrian escaped with... Give the other commanders my orders...""

Telindil slowly stepped into the light revealing his yellowish face, and a scar streaking from the side of his right eye down his cheek and down to his neck. 

""...Prepare the Horde... we strike tonight.

""Siris

""Yes

Siris pulled it from under his shirt. He gave it to Aisha and she examined it.

""Wow... It's as beautiful as I remember it. Sure it's still a bit rigid here and there but overall it's just spectacular. I can't believe you kept it this long.""

""Well

Aisha looked at Siris
_______

Siris and Aisha entered Siris' tent. Inside stood Silian Siallo

""Need something?"" Siris asked.

""Yes

""He challenged me. He wanted to see if he could beat me and I proved the poor sod wrong.""

""No Siris

Siris turned himself,

""I don't know what you're talking about.""

""You were going to let him live. I saw that you were walking away. You changed your mind

""It was a fair fight

""No Siris

Siris turned back towards Silian

""The elves killed my father!"" he yelled

""This is an example of where vengeance will take you. Not *all* Altmer killed your father. I've seen high elves do terrible and wicked things

""Siris, ""The only way we can make amends with the high elves is to forgive each other.""

""Aisha

""Siris

Siris pointed his finger towards the tent's entrance

""Get out!"" he yelled.

Silian took a deep breath and said

""*We all come

""Wait

""*we take our place in the course of time.*""

""Who are you! How do you know that verse!""

""Like I said before

With that

""He's just trying to help you

""No

""Maybe he did

""But he has to have been on the ship to have known that verse. My father only told it to me once or twice

""Maybe he told it to him sometime while you two were living by Dragonstar. You never know.""

""I just need some time to think... I'll see you later.""

""Alright

Aisha left Siris' quarters as well.

Siris looked at the map that Silian had been observing earlier. Nothing of interest lay upon it. He walked around for a moment thinking about the day. 

*""Was it wrong to kill the elf? He would have done the same to me. Of course it wasn't wrong. Those elves killed my father.""*

Siris picked his ebony sword up off his weapon rack and began brandishing it. He saw something in the sword, maybe. Siris rubbed at it even harder. But, the smudge slightly moved. Siris looked closer, and realized what it was.

Siris immediately ducked as a claw came straight for his head. He then sidestepped as another claw came for his torso. It then roared, and sliced its leg just above its hoof. The creature fell and began squealing as it crawled on the ground. Siris took his sword and plunged it into the head of the creature, and it lay dead.

It was a wereboar. It was a human who has transformed into a massive creature that killed to survive. Its tusks and claws were still as it lay dead.

*""I thought these were only found in High Rock

But then he heard the commotion

He saw what was happening.

The main camp was overrun by lycanthropes of many different kinds. The Redguards and other soldiers of the army were desperately fighting off the creatures. Siris watched as a werewolf jumped atop one of the soldiers and proceeded to tear his insides out. A werebear jumped and crashed into one of the tents, and carried her away from the fight.

A werewolf rushed toward Siris, and positioned its mouth to eat Siris' face as drool and slime poured from its lips. Siris pulled his sword from under the beast and stabbed its belly. The werewolf fell dead and rolled off its victim. 

Siris then ran in one direction with only one thought in his mind

*""Aisha.""*

Siris jumped over a werelion and as it turned its mane to fight its foe

As Siris approached Aisha's tent

""No!"" Siris yelled as he ran up to the tent

To his surprise

""I think we're even now

The two ran outside to face the lycanthropes. 

Another wereboar charged at Aisha, and allowed it to run blindly until it crashed into a tent. She then dismembered a werewolf and cut its chest.

Siris cut the wing off of a werevulture as it attempted to grab his arm

Three werelions came from around the tents and cornered Siris and Aisha. Aisha pointed her two scimitars at the beasts while Siris formed a paralysis spell in his hand. He shot it at one of the creatures, she pushed the monster off of her and sliced the head of the cat. Siris walked up to the paralyzed werelion and easily killed it before it could free itself, but all of a sudden, another werelion jumped for Siris' face...

...and Silian Siallo cut its head off.

""I don't mind you killing these things

The three then grouped together, three werewolves, three wereboars, two werebears, and four werevultures. 

The army quickly gathered their numbers and arms and drove the beasts back. The number of lycanthropes quickly diminished. The last werelion in the horde jumped on an unsuspecting victim and quickly killed him. As it prepared to savor its meal

The soldiers began cheering...

and the sun began to rise.
_________

That evening, commanders and captains gathered in the pavilion to discuss what had happened during the night.

""What was that?! One of the generals exclaimed.

""A small army of lycanthropes

""I know what lycanthropes are

""Can werecrocodiles even survive in Hammerfell?"" one of the captains asked.

""The Aldmeri Dominion must've been gathering lycanthropes. But how did they get so many?"" inquired one of the commanders.

""They probably kept them all as prisoner and released them on us."" said another commander.

""There must be more to it though

""It could be just a terror attack. Probably to strike fear into the hearts of our soldiers.

""Anyways, ""We need to bring in supplies, healing potions, cure disease potions, everything we need to make sure lycanthropy doesn't spread throughout the army.""
_______
When the meeting was over, and yonder at the sands of the desert. Siris sat down next to her.

""Siris... do you want to know the real reason I'm here?"" she asked.

Siris, ""What do you mean? I thought you joined up after the elves attacked Hegathe?""

""No Siris

""What do you mean?""

""While I was living with my parents in Hegathe, rude, self-centered pile of dirt. Well, of all the Redguards in Hegathe, *he* decided that he was the right one for me. 

When I became eighteen years of age, is that I didn't love him back. In all honesty, I actually thought you would come and rescue me from that bastard, but what were the chances of that happening, hmmm? However, my parents disregarded my request and continued to order me to marry him.

I lost my parents the day I left to join the army. I probably won't see them again as well.... who knows what else these elves will throw at us. They weren't really my parents anymore anyways. All they love now is money and riches. Well... I'm glad you're here

""I'll always be here for you

Aisha leaned her head against Siris' shoulder

It all went faster than I could realize. I was just driving to my shitty work at the steel mill. Bad working conditions


I'm driving around the corner and suddenly that black tank-like vehicle full crushes my front. My car spins like a top but at least he didn't ran into my door side. Even under shock I knew it was Batman who just hit me. Well fuck it

Suddenly I'm thrown and held down by some police offers who claim I'm guilty of some bank robbery. For further investigation I'm held captive in a prison cell over the night. But my lawyer assures me that I'm out here by tomorrow night. Well that's a stupid day. The next morning I'm torn out of my cell by guards and while being sleepy and confused I manage to ask ""Where are we going"". I see all other inmates being torn out the same way. The guard just screams ""To Arkham City!"" I have no idea what this Arkham City is


The hours go by and I hear nothing from him. I'm denied any call to the outside. Not even my family knows where I am. Suddenly shit goes crazy. I manage to keep myself alive in this huge city which is actually a prison. I fly under the radar of guys like Riddler or Two-Face. But what do you know

**Shining Ebony Part II** ^by ^/u/MasterSiegfried

Siris looked upon the grave that he had built... that now held the body of his dead father. He held a tear in his eye and put his hand on his heart,

""*We all come

*We take our place in the course of time.*

*Each of us, own way.*

*Each of us

*And if Akatosh finds us worthy

*We take our place in Sovngarde...*

You told me this a long time ago, I do. I never understood why you believe in the afterlife of the Nords, but if that was your wish, I wish for your soul to find its way to Sovngarde, and be with my mother for all eternity.""

""I see you were too late.""

Siris recognized the voice. It was the old Imperial that warned him of the Thalmor attack.

Siris grabbed his ebony sword

""Who are you?!"" Siris yelled.

""Calm down

""Answer me!""

""Alright

""How can I believe you? For all I know you're working with the Thalmor.""

""On your neck and partially hidden in your armor lies a necklace made from a shell which is white with black stripes. Your father told me that this was given to you by a sweet little girl, right before you left to come to this home on the outskirts of Dragonstar.""

Siris lowered his sword

""Alright

""I am quite unsure, there are spies all throughout Hammerfell. Any elf or even a corrupt soldier could have found this place and reported to the Thalmor.""

""Okay

""It's not as hard as it looks. If the army isn't careful

""If you know so much about me and my father

""Well, your father also wanted you to take his armor as well. It seems to be a rough fit, but I'm sure you'll grow into it.""

Siris sheathed his sword.

""Siris, but I see that Hammerfell has not. We shall fight and drive the elves out. This is my home now, and I will protect it with my life. Now, Siris, I shall watch you as I have watched your father before you. In the name of Tiber Septim, I shall follow you to the depths of Oblivion if it need be.""

""I shall lend my sword and my strength
___________
Siris and Silian packed everything that wasn't burned and walked across the sands of Hammerfell. They crossed sandstorms and the Dragontail mountains. The sun shone bright and the winds were harsh. The two pressed on until they reached Skaven.

Skaven is where the Redguards and other natives of Hammerfell gathered to sign up and train for the war. The simple soldiers watched in awe as Siris walked through the crowd

""Name?"" a Redguard said from the desk.

""Silian Siallo

Silian put his arm on Siris' shoulder and said to him

""Good luck.""

""Name?"" The Redguard said to Siris this time.

""Siris

""By the Nine, "" Alright, the camp is just outside Skaven. There are signs all around so it shouldn't be too hard to find. You'll recieve daily rations, an issued set of armor, and a sword or bow depending on your preference. Honestly, I don't even think you need it, seems you're all set.""

Siris followed Silian through Skaven. The most of the houses were stone. Others were made of clay. Many of them seemed to take a square design. The markets were not much like Dragonstar's which were constantly bustling with all kinds of people. The markets here in Skaven seemed to be mostly filled with soldiers. However

Outside Skaven

""Attention recruits!"" he yelled, by elves of all people... magic wielders and supremacists alike... they need to be taken out of our home! and you all will help do so! There are many soldiers out there right now and I know you want to get into the action, but it is your training that will make you better soldiers than anyone in Hammerfell. Now, as I said before, I am your commanding officer. I don't care if you're a man, or a woman, or a Redguard, Breton, unless they are higher rank than me. Am I clear? 

""Yes sir."" The soldiers yelled in unison. 

""Alright, over there.""

""Me?"" Siris responded.

""Yes you

""No sir

""Then how do you have armor as expensive as ebony? That must be worth several thousand septims... You any good with a sword?""

""I've had a bit of practice.""

""Somebody grab two practice swords

""Wait

""What? Are you afraid to show these fine soldiers here how to fight..."" 

Some of the soldiers smirked.

""No sir

Two wooden swords were handed to Sayid

""Try not to make a fool of yourself, you Ebony Warrior.""

Sayid encircled Siris as Siris encircled Sayid

Sayid moved first and lunged towards Siris

Small wood chips flew through the air as the two continued to hit each other's swords. Sweat coursed down Sayid's neck as he attempted to overpower Siris. He swung his sword over Siris' head, and pushed back quite harshly, and Sayid fell to the ground. Siris stood over Sayid and pointed his sword to his new officer's chest.

The whole unit started cheering as Sayid refused Siris' help to stand back up and stood back up by himself.

""Quiet!"" He yelled

""I think you'll fit in nicely

The unit trained for three months. The soldiers learned to use the sword and the bow. They learned how to stay calm in the heat of battle and they strengthened themselves through plenty of exercise. They climbed poles and hills and swam in the lakes. Officer Sayid watched Siris closely. No recruit had ever been able to beat him throughout all his years as an officer. After the three months of training

""Sayid

""Yes Captain

""Prepare your unit
______

""Alright recruits

A few hands raised in the air.

""Very well, you go up as well. Archers will be shooting into the city. If we get inside, be wary of civilians. These are not elves, they're captives. They are citizens of Hammerfell, and we are to protect them. Any armed elf you see is expendable. There will be no elves of high significance. Stay close to your unit, and for the love of Tiber Septim, listen to me. Now
_______

The regiment moved with several other battalions towards Elinhir, and ice storms flew down from the top of the walls into the Redguard army.

A Khajiit foolishly ran towards the walls, and was disintegrated by a thunderbolt.

The army raised their shields and slowly advanced towards the walls.

""Shields aren't going to work well against magic

Sayid looked back at him and said, do you have any better ideas?""

Siris looked through the unit. ""Does anyone know how to use wards?!""

""I do

""So do we

""Siris

""Well

Sayid immediately turned his head and said

Siris continued, raise it above your heads. Archers, stay in the back and shoot arrows into the city. Make your shots count. You three, take ladders in hand. Now, move forward!""

The new formation began advancing towards the city at a fast pace. Lightning flashed and fire flew straight into the wards. The unit passed the rest of the army and made its way towards the walls. When they approached the walls, with a steady stream of ashes following. 

As the rest of the army came quickly towards the ladders

He jumped over the lightning rune that had been placed by the ladder to trap him, and one by one, they fell.

It became easier for the Redguards to climb up the ladders and place new ones by the walls. The parapet was quickly flooded with Redguard soldiers and other forces from Hammerfell.

All of a sudden

...Time had suddenly stood still.

Siris looked around. Nothing was moving, falling to an elven blade. The next thing he noticed were strange symbols floating by his face.

*""I've seen these before

Siris then remembered the letter from his father

*""These words are written in Dragon, and Dah.*
*I love you

The symbols started to to sway

*...Force... Balance... Push.*

Time moved again, calmed his mind, and shouted,

""FUS RO DAH!""

A sound fit only for the dragons of old erupted from his mouth

Siris stood back up

""Thank you

Siris regained his senses and rushed over to the wall that held the lever for the drawbridge. He pulled it, destroying all the Dominion that had taken hold of it. The battle had been won.

As the remaining elves were driven out of Elinhir

""Let's hear it for the Ebony Warrior!""

The rest of the army started cheering and chanting

""Ebony! Warrior! Ebony! Warrior! Ebony! Warrior!""

And the sun began to rise.
___________

The army continued to cheer Siris, he heard somebody call his name.

""Siris! Siris!""

He rushed through the crowd... Because he recognized who that voice belonged to...

It was Aisha.

We saw it wandering through the woods to the north of us, hoping it would be gone before we returned. It had only drawn closer. I urged my herd towards a shallow cave where we could watch the being from a safe distance. We watched in fearful silence as it turned once in our direction, seeming to listen for our very breathing, before turning and lumbering off towards the eastern village. 

We saw no more of the being for quite some time, but that was not our domain. We could make no sense of the village, and so we did not know that something was wrong until it was too late. 

My son was the first to tell me of the noises coming from the village. There were the normal bustlings we associated with the villagers, as if the very ground was going to open its maw and swallow us whole. This went on for days, unstopping, until all of a sudden, the noises rang out no more. As we stepped cautiously back out onto the plains from our safe cave, we saw the being on the horizon.

No longer was it a lumbering monstrosity in torn furs. Now, running smoothly right at us with a piece of paper in one hand and a staff of the same blue rock in the other. I went to hide my herd, but I was too slow. It drank some odd colored liquid and ran faster than any villager I have ever seen. It outpaced even me, though it soon slowed directly in front of us. In our confusion, we didn’t notice until too late that it had taken blocks of stone and thrown them high around us, encompassing my entire herd in a space too small to move. It left us there for what seemed like ages before returning. I wish it had not returned at all.

Our only sight for that entire time was the passage of the moon and sun directly over our prison. I was not strong enough to be able to break down the walls, too loyal to leave for my own good. The day came when one of the walls was torn down, and there in the doorway was the being.

It used to just be the regular monsters we had to be afraid of out in the woods. Things like those nasty nekkers and andregas. The nekkers were the worst
	Now instead of nekkers, and that they had attacked some men father knew. But I shouldn't be worried, father is big and strong and he won’t let anything happen to me or mama. I just wish he was strong enough to get rid of that big river monster.
	
That big monster is part of the reason fathers business has been going so poorly and why trade is so scarce. We had to move out of Flotsam
	
That monster has been giving the entire town trouble, the nekkers probably did. I think that’s why the pretty lady with the funny hair is here. I saw her walking up the stairs to the top floor of the inn when I went into town with father yesterday. We were going to get a plow repaired at the nice dwarf’s shop. The dwarf there gives father a better price than most other people because father used to try and help non-humans like them, when we could still afford it. They still treat us nicely, and the one likes to tell me stories of magic and witches, dragons and kings, while the other dwarf works on father’s tools. He once told me about a man he called the White Wolf, who “was a man, because I've seen him. He’s here

Everyone seems to know the White Wolf, maybe stronger than father. I hope so, because then he can scare away the river monster. 

He comes through our little camp when he goes out into the woods. He always has a stern look on his face, to help fight monsters like the one in the river so mama and father can be happy again, so that father can have his store again. When I stopped him, I saw the necklace that looks like a wolf, the one the dwarf in town said was magic. 

It glowed, but I wasn’t afraid. I just wanted to be strong like him. So I asked, “Can girls be witchers too?”

That night, unsure of why he didn't go with her... why he didn't take the fight to Telindil... the one who held the fate of his best friend's soul in his grasp. He continued to stir in his sleep.  He felt the wind slowly blowing on his face, and he jolted awake.

In front of him stood a blue figure. It was ethereal in appearance and mostly transparent. 

""Who are you?"" Siris asked.

It answered in a ghostly echoey voice

""Father?!"" Siris yelled

""Indeed, and what are you doing? You're running away? Why?""

""I'm

""Siris, repelled a horde of lycanthropes, fought through a temple of undead, crushed a thousand cliff racers, and attempted to defend Taneth against an army... and you're afraid? Don't be afraid. Carry strength from souls now gone. They won't let you give in.""

""Even if I did change my mind

""Nonsense, Bavieca, will get you there. He's long gone, but his spirit will guide you to your destination.""

""Father

""Why not?""

""My heart has been crushed to embers.""

Siris father approached his son. He placed his transparent hand on Siris' shoulder

""Reignite.""

With that

Then Siris woke up.

He looked around, stretched his arms,

and he heard a horse's neigh outside in the dark of the night.
________

Morning was coming. The Redguards and other soldiers of Hammerfell stood atop an enormous sand dune that overlooked the field of sand the two armies would fight on. They watched as the Aldmeri Dominion formed up atop the other sand dune far on the other side of the field. The generals stood in front of the army and looked at how outnumbered they were. They numbered at about six thousand strong. 

This battle was the battle that would decide the fate of Hammerfell. Whether it would be controlled by the Redguards of Hammerfell

Telindil stood at the front of his army. 

""Ah, ""a few actual skeevers to crush instead of a bunch of worms.""

He turned to his soldiers

""Let's crush them and be on our way

In that instance, heard someone shout,

""Fus Ro Dah!""

Unrelenting force purged from the mouth of Siris into the sky as he sat atop the horse, except her eyes shone a completely blue hue. A small trail of blue mist also leaked from her eyes. Siris and the horse stood atop a huge sand dune that stood between, to the side of, and overlooked the other two sand dunes. The horse stood ago its hind legs as Siris shouted again,

""Fus Ro Dah!""

Immediately,

""Ebony! Warrior! Ebony! Warrior! Ebony! Warrior!""

Siris rode Bavieca down the dune and towards the Redguard army and took a spot in the front. He spotted a soldier clad in Chitin armor.

""Teldryn Sero? I thought you left?""

""Leave?"" he responded

Siris looked around.

""Where's Silian? Did he escape with you?""

""I don't know. I thought he was with you.""

Arenthia approached Siris' horse wearing her black cloak and hood and stroked its mane.

""So... what happened to the whole *I'm not coming with you* issue?"" she asked.

""Strength. I found the strength I need

Arenthia observed the horse

""Where did this beauty come from? I've never seen anything like it

""General Siris!"" one of the generals shouted

""I'll see you two on the field

Siris looked at the whole army. Every Redguard willing to fight for their homes and their families stood to protect it from the Aldmeri Dominion. He saw the looks on many of their faces

""Soldiers, and our families killed. We have all had our share of tragedy, due to this war... myself included. But, now we must hold strong. Darkness strikes to blind the strong, but faith will guide our swords. loyal hearts we'll stand as one and fight with shields of hope. No matter what happens today, we will never surrender. We will free Hammerfell. Now fight, stand by my side....""

Siris raised his sword

""and send them to Oblivion!""

The soldiers broke into cheer as Siris turned his horse around and shouted

""Charge!""

Bavieca then galloped down the dune as the soldiers shouted and charged into battle.

Several lines of horsemen charged on both sides of Siris and many

The elves shouted in unison

""Arctavoy Nou Baune Bala!""

and charged down the dune to face their enemies.

As the seconds quickly ticked by,

""Fus Ro Dah!"" 

and knocked down parts of the elven front lines as the Redguard horsemen charged into the front lines and began to slaughter the ones who had been momentarily been stunned by the words of power. 

The battle had begun.

Hordes of Redguard and High Elf began tearing each other to pieces using whatever form of weaponry that was available to their side. The sand turned red as blood was spilled all over it. Redguard soldiers were blasted away by shards of ice spewing from the hands of the elves. Others disintegrated from the impact of a properly placed lightning bolt. The Redguards

Minutes after the battle had officially started

Siris continued to shout and the unrelenting force knocked elf after elf over on the ground. Many Altmer met their end at the end of his ebony blade as he rode Bavieca through the battlefield. 

Arenthia suddenly jumped atop Bavieca's back behind Siris and grabbed her bow. She shot arrow after arrow into the hearts and neck of her enemies. As the horse ran by a werewolf, and grabbed the werewolf by its neck. As the beast struggled to attempt to throw the wood elf off of it, Arenthia stabbed its hand with a wakizashi. The creature howled in pain and as Arenthia swung in the air due to the werewolf swinging its head around. She quickly gained gained a hold on the creature's neck and stabbed it, killing it instantly. 

Arenthia jumped off as the werewolf fell to the ground and realized that she was surrounded by Altmer mages and swordsmen. Arenthia knelt to the ground as the soldiers slowly caved in on her. Within seconds, blocked the attack from the elf in front of her, and stabbed his chest, then she quickly turned around, slicing the other's neck as her cloak swayed in the air. She threw another knife into the last one who approached from the side.

Teldryn Sero, himself, cast firebolts into his foes and watched as they burned. The Atronach turned and fired a bolt of fire t Teldryn. It did not hit him, but it instead burned the face of the elf who was about to stab Teldryn in the back.

Siris fought off the elves atop Bavieca until

Telindil, Bavieca. Siris fell off Bavieca as she fell to the ground, dead. 

Siris watched as Bavieca dissolved into a blue mist and disappeared.

Siris stood up and looked towards the figure of Telindil standing atop the dune. He watched as he shouted into the air...

""Strun

Immediately

""He... he can shout?!"" Siris asked to himself.

Siris watched as Telindil walked down the dune towards the battling armies. He began swinging his arms slowly, lightning formed  in his hands. Telindil pushed his hands out, and an enormous stream of blasting lightning poured out of his hands. The lightning immediately disintegrated whatever it touched and large heaps of ashes began falling upon the sand.

Siris approached the High Elf

Siris held his shield up to hold out against the storm. It pressed on, he found strength. This strength turned into resistance and he felt himself become resistant to the destructive nature of the lightning.

Telindil stopped with an angry look on his face. He reached into his robes and pulled out a black soul gem.

""No!"" Siris yelled as he held his hand out.

As Telindil was about to touch the soul gem to his sword, breaking it into pieces. Aisha's soul was free. Telindil turned to his side to see Arenthia wielding the bow that fired the arrow. She unsheathed her wakizashis as a large group of elven soldiers charged at Siris to distract him.

Telindil held his arms out,

""You... Telindil... It was your kind that forced my people to fight for you

""Foolish Bosmer

""I do not care whether or not I die this day... Just know that my people will always resist you

Arenthia pulled her mask back up and ran towards Telindil who fired fireball after fireball at her as she dodged them. When she approached him

Siris fought off elf after elf, Arenthia.

Arenthia jumped back and threw knives toward Telindil who impeded their approach by swatting them out of the air with his sword. Arenthia ran towards Telindil again and jumped at him. Telindil backhanded Arenthia with his free hand. Arenthia crashed on the sand. Her face was burned. She reached for her sword as Telindil kicked it away from her reach. He grabbed her by the neck and lifted her up.

Siris had finished off the last elf that was in his way and was running toward the two.

""Arenthia!"" Siris yelled.

Telindil looked into Arenthia's eyes as she realized her impending doom. She looked him in the eyes in return and said

""You can kill me, Siris!""

Without a word

Siris approached behind them with a tear in his eye and Telindil turned around and said

""Ah, long while to learn that one shout, but the outcome of it has been very rewarding. I was even told one of the words of it were impossible to reach, hidden in some magical place above the sky, I hear. That didn't stop me from figuring it out, though.""

""It's time for you to face justice

Telindil burst out laughing.

Over the last few hours the area had been shot to shit and we were being sent in to fix it up.  When we arrived Billings went around a corner and got hit by a sniper, and as Lessard fired the P.I.A.T towards the sniper we all booked it around the other side of the building to get to the mortar pit.

We sat around the mortar pit for what seemed like days; filling up sandbags and fixing the sights on the mortar.  Random mortars and tank shells landed around us persistently

The Bren Carrier was a relatively big target in the area

Half an hour later we saw green smoke billowing on the horizon, and the jerries sure as hell enjoyed it as they surrendered a few minutes after.  We never saw the captain again, but I'll remember his tale until the day I die.

**Shining Ebony Part IX** ^by ^/u/MasterSiegfried

""Siris!"" Arenthia yelled

""Abandon the wall!"" Siris yelled

""Not without you!"" Aisha shouted as she rushed back to Siris

Siris took off his helmet, and held it to his heart.

""I can't lose you to these elves..."" Siris said softly

Siris then placed his helmet back on his head as Aisha ran to gather as many civilians as she could. Arenthia swung back to Siris on her rope.

""Arenthia

""No,"" she said as she started moving towards the gates. 

Siris held her back and said

""Fine!"" she snapped back

Arenthia jumped off the wall and within seconds she was swinging on another rope

Siris looked toward the gates

""Silian

""Now if it's all the same to you

Siris turned around and faced Teldryn.

""Or... I can ummm... go with you then. But if things get out of hand

""Silian

""Oh

Silian looked at Siris. He slowly blinked as he said

""As long as you fight... I shall fight by your side.""

Siris nodded his head. The three gathered all the soldiers they could find that would still fight and marched through the burning city. Civilians everywhere ran for their lives as their homes burned. 

""They're killing everyone!"" an Altmer civilian screamed

They were killing everyone. Civilians were slaughtered as the Dominion charged through Taneth. Because of the actions of one traitor

Siris and his loyal soldiers fought their way through this betrayed city. Ice storms brewed and lightning struck everywhere before Siris' eyes. As they made their way through

After fighting through the city, and ashes.

Within moments, and at the same time, terrifying. The magical helmet revealed his yellowish face, and the scar that streaked down his face.

""Telindil

Teldryn held his palm out and formed a ball of magical fire and rolled it around his hand as Telindil's soldiers started to form up around him. Teldryn lifted his arm in front of his face

""Nerevar guide me

and he hurled the ball of flame forward and watched as it crashed into the face of one of  Telindil's soldiers.

Immediately

Siris and his soldiers held fast. The first wave of elves met a swift end as Siris shouted many of them down and his soldiers slew them all with very few casualties. 

Telindil merely smiled

Telindil began to laugh, evil laugh. 

""Fools!"" He shouted, because your deaths are inevitable! Don't you see? Hammerfell belongs to the Dominion now. The Altmer shall rule all of Tamriel, and soon... all of Nirn!""

""If you think that we will live under your banner

""So be it..."" Telindil said calmly as he turned to his soldiers

At that moment, a much larger wave took its place. Wave after wave of soldiers charged. 

After several minutes of fighting, as did his other hand. He began walking towards Siris and his soldiers. As Siris' small army finished off the current wave, Telindil began moving his hands back and forth. Flames enveloped in his hands as he slowly levitated into the air.

""Get back!"" Teldryn yelled.

Telindil swung his arm upward

...and a giant blast of fire shot out from under his hand and swarmed Siris and his army...
_________

Siris opened his eyes slowly as he laid on the ground. He looked around to see the dead bodies of many of the Redguard companions he had brought with him to the center of Taneth. He saw several survivors fighting off the elves that were swarming them. He heard a yell

""Siris! We need to go

""*Teldryn is still alive*

He looked around slowly. He was not able to find Silian anywhere

He slowly stood up to find Telindil standing in front of him while the other Altmer finished off those who did not escape.

""Fus Ro Dah!"" Siris shouted.

Immediately

""I think it's time for you to die with Hammerfell

Siris picked his ebony sword and shield up as a sword quickly formed and put itself together around the hand of Telindil. Siris charged at Telindil

Telindil blocked Siris' first attack, and kicked Siris' chest without even so much as scratching his own foot. Siris was knocked back a bit, but charged in again and began swinging at the elf using every skill he had learned over the years. The two swung their swords at each other and blocked each other's attacks with ease. Telindil stepped in and Siris took his head and bashed Telindil's head with his ebony helmet. 

Surprisingly, Telindil head-butted Siris, and knocked him over. Siris stood back up, holding his sword and shield in his grasp.

Telindil ducked under Siris' strike

and sliced his leg.

As Siris yelled in pain,

and watched as he fell to the ground.

Siris laid on the ground, the high elf who was about to completely invade Hammerfell, stood over him, sword in hand. Telindil raised his sword to finish the fight.

But Telindil did not plunge his blade. Someone jumped at Telindil and knocked him away from Siris before he could be killed. This person struck at Telindil with two weapons as Telindil blocked this person's attacks. It was too dark to distinguish this person

It was Aisha.

Siris slowly held his hand out to Aisha as she continued to fight the monster known as Telindil. 

Within moments, cast a spell on her with his free hand,

and plunged his sword in her chest. 

When he pulled the weapon out

and watched as her soul was absorbed into it as she fell dead.

""No!"" Siris yelled as he regained some of his strength and knocked Telindil to the ground.

Telindil held on to the soul gem,

""Ah

The elven soldiers had finished everyone else off and now completely surrounded Siris.

""Now it's your turn

All of a sudden

A figure wearing a black cloak, and carried him away from the elves. They swung through the air and landed atop one of the burning buildings.

""Do you know how lucky we are knowing that rope would've broken with your extra weight!"" Arenthia yelled. ""Also

""Arenthia

""Come on! We don't have time for this! You can't save her! She's already gone!""

Siris picked her dead body up and followed Arenthia out of the burning city.
__________
Siris and Arenthia traveled away from the city. They walked until they reached the location of the army camp. It was deserted as he had expected. They had already gone to fight the Dominion

Siris buried Aisha on the cliff-side where they talked day after day. Siris sat near her grave until the morning of the next day. When Arenthia decided the time was right

""Siris

Siris looked back to Arenthia with a tear in his eye and said

""I'm not going with you.""

**Shining Ebony Part VIII** ^by ^/u/MasterSiegfried

""Fus Ro Dah!""

The unrelenting force purged from Siris' mouth and a sound as terrifying as the dragons of old erupted.

Arenthia threw on a black cloak, he started to blow it again, but this time, twenty horns started blowing all throughout the city and the entire city of Taneth was filled with the sound of war.

The elven ships sailed swiftly on the sea and quickly reached the shores without effort. The army of the Aldmeri Dominion then slowly withdrew from the ship and moved forward. They quickly flooded the beach as they created one huge formation. Countless waves of elves armored in their standard yellow armor marched forward until they were about three quarters of the way from the beach to Taneth.

""How many do you think there are?"" Aisha asked.

Arenthia walked toward them and looked back towards the army.

""My guess is that there's about ten thousand

""Ten what!?"" Has Taneth ever defended itself against an army this large?""

""None that I know of... We'd better hope that the rest of the army gets here in time.""

""Either way

""If all else fails, then everybody goes through there, no questions asked.""

""Quiet

No one else spoke

The elven army was composed of many, steel shields. These weren't standard shields, they were about the size of three Altmer atop each other and were very thick. These shields were also able to roll, providing an excellent means of covering for advancing to the walls. Behind the shields were the swordsmen. These soldiers conjured swords and were more advanced in the Destruction and Alteration schools of magic. Behind them were the archers. These soldiers conjured bows and were more avid in the schools of Conjuration and Illusion. The army was riddled with catapults, ballistas and ladders. 

The quiet continued to permeate through both sides. Arenthia and the archers had previously drawn their bows and were ready to fire. Siris had his ebony bow drawn as well. Siris looked at Silian

Then... The elves started chanting. It was quiet at first... barely anybody in Taneth could hear it

Arenthia held her grasp on the string as a drop of sweat rolled down the side of her neck. She muttered under her breath

""So it begins... Every one of them will die

and she released the string. Her arrow flew through the sky, and struck a tall high elf man in the neck, killing him instantly.

The army of ten thousand roared one word in their elvish tongue... and charged towards the walls in unison. 

Siris yelled

He then took a deep breath

""Fus Ro Dah!""

The unrelenting force knocked several of the elves over in their charge

Arenthia pointed a finger upward, but the majority of those in the front lines were protected by the shields. 

In retaliation, and let a horde of magical arrows fly through the sky.

""Take cover!"" Siris yelled.

Without thinking

""My knee!"" a Redguard yelled as fell from the top of the wall.

Once the shower of death was over

""Keep control of the wall!"" Arenthia yelled to Siris.

Before he could answer, the catapult which stood on top of it started firing giant rocks towards the army. Siris watched as Arenthia swung from tower to tower, helping those in charge of the catapults to start firing. 

Siris took his ebony bow, ice storms, and thunderbolts flew straight towards the defense, and anybody who wasn't paying attention was either cooked to a crisp or frozen in place.

The army of elves was rapidly advancing

Teldryn attempted to hurl firebolts towards the elves holding the ladders

Aisha and Silian Siallo stood by Siris. Teldryn looked towards Siris as he fired another firebolt and said

""If they take the wall

Silian drew his katana and said

""Let's hold the wall then.""

At that moment,

""Fus Ro Dah!""

and the elf was sent flying away from the wall towards his death. Silian and Teldryn immediately cut the ladder away from the wall and sent it falling with the rest of the Altmer atop the ladder. 
Of course, and the  struggle for the wall had begun. Elven soldiers began swarming atop the walls of Taneth firing spells at their foes and raising the dead soldiers from either side to help them in battle. Siris shouted several groups of Altmer off the wall, but had to limit how often he shouted to prevent himself from accidentally sending his allies plummeting to their deaths.

Siris watched as Aisha slaughtered her foes with the scimitars that she wielded. He knew in his heart that he should not have brought her with him

The wall was being overcrowded as time went by. Every time he killed one of them, ready to destroy as many of them as he could. 

Before the elves could dispatch him

""I told you to keep control of the wall!"" Arenthia yelled.

""Quite easy to do against an army of ten thousand

As Arenthia and Siris cleared the area, Arenthia, Teldryn, and Silian cut down the ladders and knocked them off the wall. Aisha and Silian then left to keep control of other parts of the wall.

Siris watched as elven mages threw fire, destroying it on impact.

Two elves charged at Siris and he bashed one of them with his shield, Siris sliced the elf's arm off, slashed his chest vertically, and watched as the elf fell from the wall to his death. The other elf stood up, charged towards Siris, and was brutally stabbed in the chest. Siris then spun around and beheaded the elf with the swing of his sword.

Arenthia was busy rallying the soldiers and making signs and gestures towards the soldiers who apparently already knew what they meant. She ordered soldiers to change positions

""If we continue to hold out

""Iman?""

""A Redguard noblewoman of House Suda. I'm not sure if that is her or not... I'm not sure... but... What's she doing?!""

They watched as the woman who they presumed to be Iman ran across the walls and ran up the stairs. Arenthia looked at where she was heading...

and she knew what was going on.

Arenthia broke away from Siris and started chasing after the woman. Without thinking

""Hey! You're not supposed to be up here!"" one of the guards yelled as he walked towards the woman.

Before he could stop her, and stabbed him in the back of the neck. Before the other guard could do anything, she grabbed him by the neck and slit his throat.

The woman then saw her goal... a giant lever...

She grabbed the lever...

and Arenthia jumped

Arenthia looked at the lever

The giant lever had been pulled and broken...

and the gates were opened.

**Shining Ebony Part VII** ^by ^/u/MasterSiegfried

Six months passed. The invasion of the Aldmeri Dominion pressed on

It was at this time when Siris was walking through the camp in the middle of the night

""I know who you are... Ebony Warrior.""

The voice came from that of a woman. Siris turned his head and looked upon a stranger wearing a brown cloak who leaned against the side of a tent. The face of this stranger was hidden by a brown hood. 

""You know who I am

""Me... You don't know me...but I'm sure you know of your father's order...""

""You're a Bla...""

""Shhh

""Yes

Siris led the cloaked stranger to his tent. Immediately after the woman entered, pulled out a packet, and threw it onto the map on Siris' desk. Siris picked it up, opened it, and said,

""What is this?""

""Your army is lucky I found it... on the Aldmeri envoy that I killed, you would have lost the war, and Hammerfell would be under the rule of the Aldmeri Dominion.""

""What... is it?""

The Breton woman grabbed a knife off the desk and stuck it onto the map. The knife was stuck onto one of the cities in the southeastern part of Hammerfell... Taneth.

""Your war is coming to a close... For now.""

Siris began reading the parchment concealed in the packet as she continued.

""Right now, not on land, but on sea. His entire army is close to being officially gathered together, and he *will* take Taneth. Once Taneth falls to the Aldmeri Dominion, Telindil's army *will* spread from city to city, forcing them all to surrender.""

""Why haven't the generals seen this?"" Siris asked

The woman paused for a moment

""Like I said before

""You know as well?""

""Yes

The Blade pulled her hood back over her head, she turned her head and said,

""Before I leave... I want to know... Are you... could you... possibly be... the Dragonborn?""

""What does that mean? What's a Dragonborn?""

""You should know, whom we used to serve. The ones who can learn the shouts of dragons without effort or training. Yes, I know you can use the Voice, it's pretty well known.""

""I know nothing about being this... Dragonborn.""

""Well

Siris raised his arm.

""Wait

""No

""Will I ever see you again?""

The woman thought to herself for a second
""Most likely not

""Can I at least know your name?""

The woman lifted her hood above her eyes, she placed the hood back on, turned her head towards Siris, and said,

""Delphine

and she departed from the tent and entered the darkness of the night.

Siris took a few minutes to recollect himself, he blew his horn.

_______

""You have called this council together, commander, and general?""

Siris pulled out the packet that had been given to him by Delphine and everyone in the council began whispering amongst each other. He stood up, opened it, and began reading it.

""The Aldmeri Dominion is going to attack Taneth.""

The council started talking louder.

""Not only that, and take all the other cities one by one.""

Siris stood up and said

""This is where the war ends.""

Siris looked to everyone.

""This is where we gather together and fight the Aldmeri Dominion and take back what belongs to the Redguards! If we don't end it here

Another general stood up.

""We're not ready. If Telindil already has his whole army amassed, generals, and all the other soldiers that are positioned all over Hammerfell. If this is truly the end, then we'll need every soldier available.""

""If the Dominion is coming

The entire council stood up and began arguing louder than they had ever before. 

Only Siris sat still,

""I will lead it! I will lead it!""

The council would not grow quiet.

Siris looked up

""Fus Ro Dah!""

and the top of the tent was torn asunder by the power of his unrelenting force. The council immediately silenced.

""I will lead the defense of Taneth

""Although... I do not lead enough soldiers.""

One of the older generals spoke slowly

""Well Siris... Go then... to Taneth. Seven

An older commander stood up immediately,

""What! You give Siris the title of general! Preposterous! He's only been in the war for two years! And he's only a boy no older than twenty-one years of age! What does he have besides a shiny armory and a powerful voice!""

The elder general looked at the commander

""Siris has shown his valor where men would tremble. He has faced the demon of an Altmer without fear and has led soldiers through trouble and strife. Now

Nobody else spoke.

""Then it is settled
_______

Siris and Aisha sat atop the cliff that overlooked the camp as the sun was setting.

""You know I'm coming with you

Siris looked towards Aisha.

""I was afraid you would say that...""

""Don't worry

""Silian watches over me

""Well if Silian comes with you, we could start over, live on Stros M'kai or on another ship.""

Siris stood up and helped Aisha stand up as well.

""Maybe we can,"" Siris said without a serious face.

""I know

""Mind if I interrupt?"" said a voice somewhat close.

Siris and Aisha both looked as Sillian Siallo walked up to the two.

""Do you mind if I speak to Siris alone?""

""No

""Sure

Aisha then left the two alone.

""Silian

""I want to know if you are ready to end this.""

""Of course I am.""

""What I mean is

""I don't understand

""I just want you to remember that I want you to know what the right thing to do is... when the time comes.""
_______

The next day, Aisha, Teldryn Sero, and eight hundred capable warriors traveled across the sands of Hammerfell to Taneth. 

Taneth seemed to be more of a fortress than a city. The heavy fortifications and towers made several of the soldiers wonder why the Dominion would start here. It was located about a quarter of a mile away from the sea

Once inside

""Greetings, guardian of Taneth, and yes I was named after the city in Valenwood. Yes, I have heard what your envoys had to say, but is it true? Is the Aldmeri Dominion really going to start their invasion here at Taneth?""

""Yes, ""But may I ask, aren't the Bosmer allied with the Dominion?""

""Allow me to correct you on that. First, I was born in Hammerfell. I've never been to Valenwood. I advise you to never ask anything like that again.""

""Sorry

""Can we get all those who cannot fight out of the city?""

""There's no time

Arenthia signaled a Redguard who then took off

""We need to prepare the city for the attack
Everyone who was available participated in preparing the city for the attack. Swords were sharpened, armor was forged and tempered, the gates were fortified, burning oil was produced, archers flooded the towers and the walls, and swordsmen gathered near the gates and atop the walls. When everything was as ready as it could be, Siris, Silian

""This is no Blacklight

Arenthia walked up to Siris and said

""Everything is ready

Aisha stood by Siris and they both watched the sea.

""This is it

""This is the end

Siris held Aisha close

For he saw the elven ships sailing over the horizon.

1364257721.0,1b0dcd,[Skyrim] A Guard's Tale: Pt 5 The Map and the Mastermind,Little_but_Fierce,30,9,8,"I sat with Roddy, sitting alone


I’m sure Jenassa could have killed the dragon with only that look.  I’d once overheard her say death was her art; which had turned me right around and straight back out of the Hunstman.


Today she was missing from her post. Elrindir had reported she had packed up and left with the Dragonborn


Roddy was sitting with his arms folded his own back against the wall and Loki was staring at him like a skeever on skooma. He’d never seen Roddy away from his post, with hair like polished dwarven plate and eyes bluer than a Dartwing. Even his current frown just made him look moodily romantic.


“Loki – stop staring.” I whispered


Heric said “So Bally has given permission for the DB to buy Breezeyhome and given ‘Fancy Pants’ Proventus 5000 gold for it?” basically repeating what I had just said. 


“Yes


“OK, I don’t understand,” he lowered his voice, “Why would Ball..., the Jarl, let the Dark Brotherhood buy a home in the ‘Run?”


I nearly choked on my drink and the other two looked horrified at Heric.


“Not the Dark Brotherhood, remember when we said we’d call him that?” I shook my head, “Oh never mind.”


“OH!” he said and chuckled


Roddy looked up the ceiling


As the Draggers guards told it, especially after the survivors described the sight of the dragon’s soul entering the man - there were pretty glowing lights apparently.  Oh and he could also shout - really loud.


And then we heard, property rights, and the bloody Axe of Whiterun - not that it had actual blood on it but none of it sat well with me.


This I knew, and he had *helped* with killing the dragon. And four of our own were dead. ‘Absorbing’ souls sounded on the Daedra side of the ledger to me.


I pulled out the map and smoothed it out. I’d had an opportunity to ink it up so the marks and lines stood out. I placed it in the middle of the table


“This is what I was telling you about. This is a copy of the map from the lump of stone the DB, “had when he was locked up.”


The men leaned closer, a mix of lavender, juniper and was that honey? I bit my lip trying not to laugh, imagining him not only guarding Arcadia’s but shopping there too and happily browsing the lotions and potions, in helmet and cuirass. I wondered if she gave him a discount. He gave me a sharp look and I looked innocently at the map.


“What is it?” Loki said softly and we all tried not to look surprised.


“I don’t know


They looked at it again closely


Minutes passed.


“It’s not the guardian stones


“Mmmm.” Roddy murmured


Loki turned it a little


Heric spoke, from the snow capped Velothi Mountains to the rocky Druadach peaks. It came from the dangerous depths of Bleak Falls Barrow, on the hills above Riverwood.” He stated then belched loudly, “Anyone want some more mead, my shout. Shout. Ha ha. Maybe I’m the Dragonborn.  Ha ha.”


We stared at him and obviously thinking we didn’t want more drink


“Heric! By all the Gods! What are you talking about?” 


“I heard Farengar going on about it up in Draggers.” He lowered his voice again


Roddy’s face was in his hands


I said. “Heric, and a sweet roll, I really need a sweet roll.”

“huh, one I didn’t expect from the stone-faced girl of the caves. 

It was as if she derided herself for that one laugh as if it were a moment of weakness. I couldn’t even get her to specify her directions after that.

So I stumbled back to my room, so I made sure to tell all of my most raucous tales. I had the bar rolling fairly quickly. The game grew wearisome after a few hours and a few rounds though. The tense silence of the road up here wore me out too, so I bid a fond farewell to my audience and crashed on the straw cot. 

There have been only three times I’ve woken up in a different place than I fell asleep, yet lacking in chill. The ceiling was full of icicles, each one looking less steady than the last. I looked over to the door. Well, I tried to look over to the door. My head wouldn’t move. Neither would my legs. Or my arms. What in Nirn had I gotten myself into?? I lay like that for hours. At least, it felt like hours. You try being paralyzed for a while, and see how good your time perception is. I tried moving my mouth to yell several times. No luck. 

The monotony finally broke when an Altmer in black robes strode confidently in. He looked at the helpless fury in my eyes
“Calm down my dear talkative Nord. You’ll thank me when I’m through.”
Bloody elves. Always think they know what’s best.  I was hardly in a position to protest, and said, “what I’m about to do may shock you, just remember to never allow your spinal cord to sever.” What the?....

**15th of Sun's Dawn**  
Success! Well
My first full day on the streets of Windhelm have yielded a mixed blessing. I shall relate first the good
The good news: I have encountered my first 'subject'. Going by the mysterious moniker of 'Silda the Unseen', uttering a string of curses the like of which I have never before heard spill from a woman's mouth. Once I had rectified the misunderstanding and assured her that I was not, in point of fact, attempting to procure her services as a 'woman of the night' (her term for it was rather more... colourful) we got along famously over several bowls of hot oatmeal and some of Nils' hot spiced wine. It transpires that for Silda, being 'Unseen' has for many years also been synonymous with being 'Unheard', and I was therefore blessed with a wealth of information - much of it utterly mundane or so blasphemous as to be unrepeatable - from which I have compiled the tale below.  

&gt;**Silda the Unseen of Windhelm**  
&gt;""Age and lineage unknown, so rock-strewn, that it would cause even the sturdiest mount to falter and the most sure-footed guide to stumble from time to time.  
&gt;At the top of that mountain stands a monastery
&gt;Silda was one of five children 'gifted' as helpers to the priests from one of the many orphanages in Cyrodiil. In exchange the priests would provide food
&gt;Fascinated by the rituals and disciplined prayer of her keepers, and to take from them the things she determined they would not miss. Silda soon discovered that the priests were not so pious as to be above keeping the best of the strictly rationed vittles for themselves. She would take the spoils of her silent forays and share them with her fellow orphans. Oft times she was caught (at least in the beginning), and thus she learned to weather a beating as well as any man.  
&gt;For months they toiled at all hours of the day; fetching, bathing, guiding and otherwise attending to the needs of the blind priests. In turn the priests fed them, schooled them in letters, even named them (after legends, scholars and - in Silda's case - moths).  
&gt;Silda's memories of the Moth Priests are grown distant with time
&gt;She followed her master into his chambers, navigating the steps and the slopes. To Silda’s dismay (she had heard tell of a delivery of sweet treats) he passed the locked pantry and continued down the halls, down deep into the depths of the monastery and the mountain itself. Distracted by the tapestries and trinkets whilst her master perused his scrolls, Silda did not hear him rise to leave, and came to find herself locked within a secret chamber, with only the flickering candles and mounds of old scrolls for company. Alone and frightened, Silda distracted herself by examining the scrolls that lay upon her master’s desk. Most were in languages she did not understand comprising symbols she did not even recognise, written in her now sightless master’s uneven script. It told of ancient times, devoured by pain and lost to all sense of herself.  
&gt;Such visions as she recounts of the hours after she spoke aloud the forbidden words shall not be repeated here by this author
&gt;Upon waking, whips and switches of the several priests who discovered her. She did not cry, she said, because now she understood the true meaning of pain, and that true pain could not be inflicted at the hands of blind priests.  
&gt;Her master took pity on her, and tried to explain the power of the scrolls. ""Some go blind, some go mad. None are ever the same again."" He dampened her brow when one of her wounds festered and she broke a fever. He chided her for her foolishness, following him to the scrollroom, yet treated her with paternal affection the like of which Silda had never known. From guilt, she supposes now. Silda the Unseen, he called her
&gt;Silda claims to have been witness to events that this author has confirmed as taking place more than one hundred years ago. She claims that since that day in the scrollroom her body has not aged a single day,"" she calls to passers by outside the Palace of the Kings, and it is true that her voice is the thin and broken whinny of a crone. Her black eyes speak of untold hardships, far beyond the mere inconvenience of street life, an unending battle waged upon the unforgiving stones of Windhelm.  
&gt;Whether her tale is true or no, oblivious.  
&gt;In the eyes of Tamriel

This I have transcribed into the following verse for future bardic performances

**The Ballad of Silda the Unseen**  
*Unclaimed and unloved
From orphanage halls

*From mistress to master
Was Silda the silent

*She served her blind masters
Silda the unworried

*Then one fateful day whilst in search of bread (curiosity unchecked and nerve without bound)
Determined to keep the other children fed

*Unspeakable darkness and horrors untold
Silda followed in silence and read from the scrolls

*A lifetime of torture in one moment lived
Her masters did beat her; only one would forgive

*And now on the cold streets of old Windhelm city
“Have mercy on me

And so to the bad news: When I came to settle my debts at Candlehearth for the night's accommodation and the hot meal, two torchworm-silk handkerchiefs and my tin of Nirnsnuff. Silda too seems to have vanished, and all the city guards did was laugh when I related to them my morning's encounter.  
And so I find myself alone and quite penniless in a strange city.  
The innkeep
I am quite at a loss.

Convinced that I was conspiring with Wilhelm to oust her as resident bard, Lynly let it be known about town that I was harbouring unsavoury designs upon the young maiden Fastred. Outrageous!

I woke up to the sound of voices. Familiar ones. That was nice. No, and stopped. Of course I had to have left my battle gear in the entryway. Pah. No matter. I could probably take their entire forces without any armor. Walking out, I boldly approached the voices. 
“I tell you, and let him be. You won’t find your mediator in him anymore. The Change has seen to that.”
“Papa

Woah. Matilda was Rorik’s daugher? What kind of a raising did she get

I heard Rorik sigh, or change his mind. He’s as pig-headed as they come, and while it was endearing before, you’ve pushed it past reason now.” Walking in, I said “Damn right I’m not going to change my mind. This little bitch led me to a death trap!” After the brief surprise, Rorik got up, and gave me a right cross to the jaw. After staggering back, “What was that for? A bitch is as a bitch does
Stone-faced, you seem to be fine, while there’s a man back in Winterhold with his head and neck separated.”
“I see they’ve fed you with their lies. Your flesh and blood? We’re battle-brothers! And you turn on me now?” I said
“Damn it Ragnar! It’s because we’re battle brothers that I recommended you to the Immentia in the first place!”

“Who in Mundus are the Immentia?” I asked. Perhaps it was the name of those bastards who stabbed me. Matilda spoke up for the first time since I entered the room. “Immentia is a group dedicated to working behind the scenes to bring about better governance among Tamriel. We’re very small, with near immortality and invulnerability. It is only by decapitation that we can be killed. You were in no danger from the knife.”
“By bloody hands of Stendarr, the best sword arm in Tamriel, what I should be doing? Who were they to give me such a position without asking? Rorik interrupted my mounting fury with a lame excuse: “It’s part of the initiation! You have to be able to obey without question, even if the end is unclear. It’s a test of loyalty.”

“Damn your loyalty, grabbed me by the collar and said,
“I fought for your admittance. I believed my father’s tales of you. I thought you would be the one to bring our plan to fruition, my rage near it’s apex.  I was about to roar about how I could hardly have shown loyalty to a group that was intent on torturing me, when Rorik interrupted, with a voice as cold and hard as ice-coated ebony, “I think you should leave now, while you still have your one day of freedom.” 

Turning to look at my treacherous friend, saying, “You know why they call me Ragnar the Red? Because by my sword alone, I made an entire river flow red with blood. Pray to Stendarr when you come for me, bitch.” I then grabbed my armor and stomped out. Some friends they were. I angled myself toward Whiterun, and started the long walk there. As I was leaving, I caught Rorik telling Matilda
“See
Filthy Traitor.

The journey to Whiterun was uneventful. I was traveling fast, I took up a spot in the Bannered Mare. Seeing as the Immentia were noble bastards, it was unlikely they’d attack while I was surrounded by other innocents. In the meantime, while the mead was good and the food savoury, I figured I should educated the populace on my heroics. Akatosh knows I never got enough credit for them. 
At first, while making sure there wasn’t an overabundance of mead, of course. My throat did tend to get rather dry while explaining my glories. 

By the end of the night, I went to sleep, planning to stay here for a few days, then move on when I’d convinced the locals of my prominence. They’d act as a bodyguard for any of the puny forces the Immentia sent after me. 

The next day passed much like the last. I regaled the crowd all day with tales of my adventures

I started slower this time, he did help in some small way. Then I moved to my greater exploits, hoping to inspire loyalty in the locals. All day, I hammered at them, trying to get them to see the light of the presence they were in. No luck.

Halfway through the evening, the one of how I personally subdued an entire uprising. A rousing good tale, that one. Suddenly, he took his hood off and stared at me.
Dibella’s bloody breasts, saying, “How many of you have asked this man to leave?” The petulant, ungrateful lot raised their hands in unison, making wild cries of affirmation.
“How many times has given you peace from his hopelessly arrogant self-aggrandizement?” The inn exploded in shouts of how often they’d tried to stop me. Bloody treacherous peasants. Trying to assert my Gods-given dominance, Matilda drew her long, thin sword, and said in a furious voice, “I think it’s high time you bleed for your crimes.”

The Inn grew tense. Slowly
“Well lass
With furious speed, probing, seeking an opening. There! Swinging with all of my near-godlike might, I aimed at the hole she’d left in her defense. I was grinning with battle adrenaline. Man it would feel good to watch that bi---

1364170322.0,1axylz,[Skyrim] A Guard's Tale: Pt. 4 The Heroic Dead,Little_but_Fierce,27,12,7,"I lay on my bunk not sleeping. It was late and dawn was likely closer than dusk. I could hear the slow breathing of the other guards along with Heric’s usual melodic snoring. I generally hated sleeping in the barracks. I didn’t mind the sharing, the moons and the world outside.


When I was small, on top of the thatch, with a sturdy rail all around. Benny and I would wrap ourselves in our favourite furs and curl up on the warm wood. Once it was fully dark, Father would lean out, resting his arms on the sill and tell us the tales of the stars; the stories of the 3 Guardians and how the Serpent chased the others around the sky. He’d tell me, high up there with my brother beside me, where if I looked hard I could see all the way to Solitude, but my favourite story was always the Serpent as it went its own way and followed its own path. 
I really wished I could see it now

Loki had survived the attack on the tower with only a few burns and slightly singed hair.  He was resting in the temple and his wounds would heal quickly. I wasn’t so sure about his spirit as he had not spoken since he’d returned. Cauis had taken him off the roster.


Hroki and Tor were dead


I knew this as the Commander had sent me down to the tower with Anders and Heric to recover the bodies. We borrowed a cart from Severio’s farm


When we got there we stopped, but this took my breath and all my words from me. It was as big as a mammoth and patches of tundra around it were still smouldering.


As we discovered were the two burnt bodies. We weren’t even sure who they were. I cannot describe the smell except to say it was gut-wrenching. Even now with lavender tucked into my clothes and bedding I am afraid it will never leave me.


We found Tor’s body lying peacefully on the cobbles. He was recognisable, covering his face. There was very little blood but every bone in his body was broken. I couldn’t imagine how the Dragon must have lifted Tor up so gently, barely breaking his skin before he released him high in the sky and he fell slamming into the ground, sending him to Sovngarde. 


One body was missing entirely. 


Heric and I had walked back to the stables to fetch some buckets and water so we could dowse the hot bodies for removal.


“Luna


“Yes.”


“They killed it.”


“Yes they did.”

“Not before it killed some of us.”


“No.”


“Not sure I want to go out hunting dragons


“Me neither


After we dowsed the bodies and waited for the steam to subside, but we couldn’t help ourselves, and at least it stopped the tears from coming.


After we left them in Anders care at the Hall of the Dead, without. Anders had said he would lay them together as they had died. Anders was sweet, and practical as each could still not be named. 


Any spare armour or weapons would be reissued. Personal belongings would be packed up and sent back to their kin. Caius wrote the letters that would inform them of the deaths.  They would go out with a courier on the morrow along with the requisite 50 gold the Jarl sent to relatives of any guard who died defending the city. I was very glad the task had not been mine.


It had been bad enough packing up their possessions. Hroki had had so little


The sad knowledge of its existence weighed heavy on me

**16th of Sun's Height**  

O deepest joy! O inexpressible gratitude! O bounteous and merciful gods! I have been freed

As you will have gathered from my last entry, my soul trapped forever beneath the streets of Riften. However, the food was very agreeable and the guards mostly kind-hearted. I don't believe I should have lasted as long as I did without Luna's special recipe for scrambled eggs (and her agreement to fetch me a non-scratchy blanket from her own belongings. Riften wool is shockingly rough against the skin).  

Two things happened in those blackest of nights that saw me through. Firstly I forged a reluctant and uneasy acquaintance with my snoring prison-mate, by the imbibing of large quantities of mead). A most disagreeable fellow indeed, with an astonishingly high opinion of himself, though this paled in comparison to his perception of the regard in which he is held by every single woman in Tamriel. His manners in dealing with the female guards caused me to cringe such that if the winds had changed, my face would have been stuck in a very contorted expression indeed. To their credit, the guards never once reacted to his advances or his jibes, which can be explained purely as self-preservation given the fellow's high standing in the town. Sibbi, is the grandson of Maven Black-Briar, but I took great pleasure in inferring all kinds of devious and revolting trickery involving the apple cider and porridge he demanded every morning for breakfast.  

I digress. To make a long story slightly shorter, nodding and agreeing at the appropriate moments. But then… in his rambling and self-aggrandising tale of woe, his description of the woman - Svidi, he called her - began to seem terribly familiar. 'Paranoid doesn't begin to describe it,' he said, shaking his head. 'Every hour of the day Svidi wanted accounting for. Can you imagine! A man can only take so much. I have my *flaws*, of course. What man doesn't? And in my defence, a woman greatly wanting of my affections. Who was I to deny her of my… talents?' On and on he went

Luna waited for me at the foot of the stairs, whereupon the stranger drew back their hood and … O glorious delight! Luaffyn beamed at me, never more beautiful to my eyes than in that flickering lamplight, an amulet of Mara glittering at her throat. We ran into each other's arms and embraced, and wept… oh how I wept…  

'Very touching, faded away into nothing. I hadn't the heart to utter the poor girl's death sentence. And so I told Sibbi that Svidi had run to Solitude and was working as a servant girl in the Blue Palace. If nothing else, it will keep Sibbi's men busy for a while getting all the way across the province.

Truth be told, Nelkir is a repulsive little bastard without a good word to say to anyone and I would far rather spend the day wheedling tall tales from Brenuin, despite his malodorous air and habit of constantly scratching himself as though infested.

Today I woke up in the dark.  I was sore from head to toe


My head was pounding something fierce.  I wiggled a bit


I woke up again.  I wondered how much time had passed.  Five minutes? A day? A week?  I felt like it had been ages,' she'd come for me.  She always came for me.


Life on the street isn't easy, but she wasn't just an average street rat.  She was always the smart one; the strong one; the quick one.  From the very beginning, when she'd distract a merchant while I borrowed a few apples or a loaf of bread, to just recently when she really pulled my ass out of the fire.


She always comes for me.  She left- was gone for three days and came back after having gone beyond the city walls, 'Hero of Shaemoore.'  I knew she'd come back when I needed her- and she did.  I was neck deep with Two-Blade Pete over Alice's capture... of course she had to say her ""I told you so,"" but she helped me anyway.


She's my best friend.  We've been through everything together.  She's like the sister I'm pretty sure I never had.  Stolen apples taste so much sweeter when you're lounged in an alley with your best friend beside you


But at the moment, and the ropes were too tight- making it so I could barely feel my hands or feet.  Another wave of panic ran through me, but I tried to push it away.  She'd be here.  She'd come for me.


Sure, threatened to toss us in jail for theft?  They were the enemies.


But she was still her.  She hadn't changed that much, and tell me how stupid I was to get captured by Pete's gang of thugs.  I'd look properly ashamed for a bit then she'd be back.  We'd steal some apples and sit in  shady alley and enjoy the fruits of someone else's labor- just like old times.


How long had it been, ""That bitch is at the well right now.""  Heavy footsteps came toward me, ""You hear that, Quinn?"" the voice yelled in my face, ""She's not here.  She's in the city, fighting beside her beloved Seraph.""  A kick connected with my side and I tried to curl up into a ball, whimpering into the gag.

I roamed the ice-coated walls, they were more like cages built into the ice. Creepy. Why did I let that unnatural girl lead me to such an unnatural place? Damn her. Damn the bloody elves. Who were they to treat me, Ragnar the Red, greatest sellsword from here to Cyrodiil, like a lab rat? They would feel my vengeance like the very scourge of Molag Bal himself. 

Turning from the hallway into an open closet

“Please, and I slammed open the doors, surprising a small council of mixed races. I spotted my torturer at the head of the table, looking fairly panicked. I roared
“I AM RAGNAR THE RED. SLAYER OF HUNDREDS

“You have been given a gift beyond price

“I was never given a choice! And stabbing me in the chest is a poor way to repay me for traveling up here!” My brief resistance was silenced again. 
The elf looked briefly sad, “it is as I feared. The magic brought out the worst in him.” Looking up again, he stared straight at me, and said “On account of Matilda’s defense of your character, you have two days. You may go anywhere you think necessary, but know this – we will never stop hunting you. Only with your death shall we be satisfied.”
There was the odd
I had reappeared on a large tundra. I looked around frantically

I had turned about frantically for a while, so he’d probably return the favor.

Marching confidently down the road, and yelled,
“Rorik! You miserable Legion dog

“So how’d you end up here?” Laughing

“I beg your pardon! Falling into an ambush and needing rescuing hardly makes you a hero!”

Three months passed since the day when the lycanthropes attacked. Siris continued to show his valor through his military skills. Most of the elven forts and encampments could not hold out against the armies

Throughout this period

One day
____

Siris, and the rest of Siris' unit approached a small oasis. The water within it was sky-blue and looked clear and refreshing.

The unit quickly jumped towards the water and started drinking. Siris walked around. He heard a rustle coming from a bush. Was it a bird? a rabbit maybe? He walked over to the bush and looked into it. He saw a pair of yellow eyes staring towards him. An elf jumped out of the bush and attempted to stab him. Siris drew his sword

""To arms!"" Siris yelled.

The rest of the soldiers quickly grabbed their swords, axes, and bows and grouped together as Altmer soldiers jumped from the bushes and began spewing fiery and freezing magic upon them. The Redguards quickly overpowered them.

The elves quickly gave up the fight and started running. They ran out of the oasis and Siris and his unit pursued them into the desert as night began to fall. After a few hours of chasing into the night

A temple stood over the horizon

""What do you think is in there?"" one of the Redguards asked nervously.

""I'm not going into some temple

""Who knows what could be in there

""I think we should root them out

The soldiers started moving towards the temple.

The temple had many intricate designs and many different symbols on it that nobody could read. They entered the the temple.
____

The inside was flooded with designs, so as to not awaken this quiet place. There seemed to be no sign of the elves.

""What do you think this is?"" Aisha quietly asked.

""I'm not sure, Silian?""

""I've been almost everywhere in Tamriel... and yet... I have never seen anything as diverse as this.""

The group came upon a passageway that lead to two directions.

""Captain

Siris said

Siris turned towards the left passageway and everybody else followed him. The symbols became stranger and stranger as they walked through the passageway.

The group of soldiers came upon a large

""Check them."" Siris said.

To their surprise

The Dunmer trembled

""This is no draugr crypt, what do you all think it is?""

Everybody looked upon the picture in question.

""It appears to be a staff."" Siris answered

""That's no ordinary staff

At the moment he said that,

The once dead elves began rising from the dead.

Without thinking

The soldiers grabbed their weapons and started to hack at the undead. Silian cut off one of their arms and out poured a slow stream of worms. The elf was unhindered

Before long

""What was that!"" Siris yelled towards the Redguard who spoke of the staff

""I've studied this for as long as I can remember, but I'm going to focus on the current situation. A little under two hundred years ago, during the time of the Oblivion Crisis, Mannimarco, the King of Worms appeared in Cyrodil and began attacking the Mages Guild. Hannibal Traven, the Archmage of Cyrodil's Mages guild, gave his own soul to the Hero of Kvatch, the one who closed the Oblivion Gates

He pointed at the picture.

""The Staff of Worms.""

""What's so special about it?"" Aisha asked.

""This staff seemed to be useless to the hero

The staff was able to raise people from the dead. It doesn't seem all too powerful, and that only means one thing...""

""The elves have the staff

""Precisely!"" said the Redguard. This almost definitely means that there are more Thalmor here and that somebody here holds the staff.

After saying that, shrills, and moans were heard in several directions. 

""Quickly!"" Siris shouted

He began running through a large passageway that led out of the room and everybody followed him. 

Creatures came running towards them from both behind and in front of them. The eyes of these zombies seemed to glow bright purple. Other than that

Siris continued running towards these creatures as the soldiers prepared to drive their weapons into these beasts. When they were close enough

""FUS RO DAH!""

and the creatures that were in front of the unit were knocked down to the ground. Siris and the rest of the soldiers ran past them

When the zombies had been decimated

Aisha approached Siris and said

""Siris

""No

""As much as I hate to say this, and it can do this, there must be a reason for them to have it.""

""Whatever the reason they have for holding it is

Siris, and the rest of the unit continued through the many different passageways throughout the temple. A wave of the decayed and deformed zombies continued to attack in ambushes. The timing of their attacks were unpredictable. Everyone held their weapons up to prevent themselves from being taken by surprise.

At one point,

""Well

""Then why do the elves have the staff if they can't control them?"" asked the Dunmer from before.

""Probably they aren't here to control them

""I don't know

They kept moving and fighting through the temple until they approached a large door guarded by two elves. Two arrows flew into the heads of these guards

""This must be it."" Siris said.

The door was opened and the soldiers rushed in with Siris leading them. When they entered, had the most intricate symbols and designs out of all the other rooms, and it was colored red and black. The Thalmor stood all around the room. In the middle of this circular room stood a high elf with a large scar down his face. He was holding the Staff of Worms.

""Ah, ""But, before I completely obliterate you all, allow me to introduce myself. I am Telindil, supreme general of the Aldmeri Dominion here in Hammerfell, and master of the arcane arts... and you are?""

""Siris

Telindil stared at him for a moment

""Ah yes

""What are you talking about?"" Siris asked. 

""This staff is to be your undoing

""Give it up. You can't even control the creatures.""

""The creatures? Who said anything about controlling the creatures? Of course

""Then what is it?""

""This staff will allow me to absorb the power of Mannimarco, I shall squash every Redguard and later, any empire! There is nothing you can do to stop it.""

""You're wrong. You killed my father

""Don't even try

""I beg to differ

""I beg to differ as well, the wall of this circular room began cracking in multiple areas. Hordes of the undead creatures began pouring out as the wall began collapsing in the cracked areas.

The creatures began killing both the elves and Siris' unit

Siris, more poured out, and all of a sudden,

An large beast crashed through the wall. This beast was no taller than a giant, and somewhat similar to that of a werewolf, however, it only had one eye.

It took a step and crushed an elf woman under its foot. It then impaled a Redguard with its arm and proceeded to eat it. Soldiers from both sides came together and tried to take it down

The giant creature came upon Aisha and she jumped out of the way as it attempted to grab her with its claws. She tried hitting her swords against the creature's forearms

But Siris jumped in the way of the beast, trying to throw Siris off, but he held on. He took his sword and blocked the incoming claw attack. The creature then threw him up into the air, and he came back down on its head. 

Siris quickly drew his bow, but then he noticed something...

... Telindil was levitating

Without thinking, however, the arrow hit the Staff of Worms. The force of the arrow broke the staff in two and Telindil came crashing down. The beast fell dead, for the staff was broken. All of the other undead creatures followed suit and the room was left with Siris and several of his troops with Telindil with fewer troops.

Telindil, gave a cruel and wicked smile, and said,

""It seems you've won this one, despite these circumstances, but what purpose would I have in doing so? You've already destroyed what I came here for. No, when I kill you, I want you to be crawling on your belly, demanding for mercy. Will you receive this mercy? No, you will not receive such mercy

Siris yelled and charged at Telindil

""Is the staff gone?"" asked Siris.

""No, as we've just seen, but they always reappear at some point. No one will know when the artifact reappears, it could be soon or in a hundred years. Once the artifact reappears, someone will be there to claim it. For now it is gone. Let's get back.

When they exited the temple
____

After Siris and his unit came back to the camp

""Thanks for saving me... I guess

""It's fine

Aisha looked over at the camp

""Siris

Siris looked over at the blue sky and the sands of the desert. He thought of his father

""Sovngarde

This Argonian motherfucker walks in, when clearly its not even remotely close to his handwriting. She believes this dude and now she never wants to see Sven ever again. Great, shes probably going to end up marrying that stupid Elven Bard.
Now this slimy Argonian dude comes up to me and starts selling me shit I don't need/want. Apparently he had overheard my conversation with Camilla so he asks whats up, with him, kill two birds with one stone amirite?

So fast forward like a day, he actually got it back. Great now I have to pay this asshole. So he tells me that my recently sold shipments would suffice, so I have to give this dude 500 gold. Dude then says, wait there's more and sells me even more useless junk that I don't need and now I'm left with like 13 gold coins. Motherfucker. At least he leaves right after that, but right after he leaves I look down and the fucking Dragonclaw I put on the counter right in front of me is gone, as wells as half my inventory. That slimy asshole stole that shit right in front of me, I mean no one else has been in the shop all day.

So I'm struggling now to keep my business afloat, Fendale or something, hasn't returned any of her letters. But hey, at least she won't be marrying an elf. I'm sitting at the counter, ready to fall asleep its been so dead, and that son of a bitch Argonian walks in. He ignores me completely and instead walks over to Camilla and gives her an Amulet of Mara. THIS ASSHOLE WANTS TO MARRY CAMILLA? He probably said something like Fandell wanted her to be with him or some other bullshit. Oh great, she accepted. I'm going to be related to this asshole. Uh Oh
He's taken my claw, to top it all off, I'm now his brother in law. I'm going to have half Imperial, half Argonian nieces and nephews. Motherfucker.",,False,self,False,t3_183xyh

**10th of Sun's Height**  

How to begin this entry. I feel as though my life has taken a severe wrong turn at some juncture and I shall be forever paying the price. I never should have come here.  

I write this from - of all places - a cramped prison cell beneath the streets of Riften. I am only glad that my dear mother is not alive to learn of my fate

How did I come to be here? I must write quickly as the hour grows late

I found Brynjolf the very next morning after my last entry, in retrospect; however, Brynjolf is a charming and very persuasive companion and soon we were laughing together over a flagon or four of Black-Briar mead and planning our 'charity' event. Little did I know, the only charity Brynjolf and his companions were planning would be for the benefit of the Thieves Guild. I am such a fool.  

Here comes the guard now. I shall write more tomorrow if my materials are not confiscated.  

**11th of Sun's Height**  

I must say, and not always immediately identifiable either by sight nor by taste. Here in prison I have been served scrambled eggs and spicy sausage this morning, with a large jug of warm apple cider. I have had far worse meals in much more salubrious surroundings. The other cells are empty save for the one furthest from me, the occupant of which has been snoring lightly since my arrival. The guards check in every hour or so, and one of them - a warm-voiced Nord woman by the name of Luna - hails from Whiterun and has prevailed upon me for updates on the town and its citizens. In exchange I have been allowed to practice my lute for two hours each evening as long as I 'behave'. How one could be expected to misbehave in a stone cell featuring nothing more than a bed roll and a waste bucket I do not know.  

**12th of Sun's Height**  

Word of my evening practice sessions seems to have spread amongst the guards. Luna tells me they drew straws to see which four unlucky souls would take gatehouse shifts in the rain whilst the others brought stools and cushions and called out requests in between gossipy conversations about citizens and noblemen.  

This is all very grand

I would very much like to go home. I am no fearless adventurer. I am but a simple bard blessed with a gods-given talent for melody and rhyme. I don't belong in prison. I am consumed with hopelessness and fear. Fear that I will waste away in this cell,False,self,t5_2vafm,False,,,t3_1ica5l

Nigel crouched looking through the windows at the street outside; a broad smile crossed his face when he spotted Astartes scouts in the streets. ""They've broken the line."" Nigel whispered ""You'll see Ry'. The Astartes will beat back the traitors and liberate the city."" Ryan had no doubt about the Astartes inevitable victory but as far as battles went in the 41st millennium they could last for years before ending. For him it wasn't a matter of 'if' it was 'when'. Ryan and Nigel had been through several campaigns together, twitchy, feeling he always did when trouble was brewing.

After a moment of resting Ryan crawled over to the broken turret gun that had carried them through so many fights. For what seemed like the millionth time Ryan peeked up over its rim before beginning his attempted repairs. The carnage was unimaginable. Traitors, that relic had surely saved them from the taint that had befallen a large number of the guardsmen outside the church.

With a sudden whirr and clank the gun powered back on but Ryan was quick to silence it. He didn't want any unnecessary attention. When he got up to say something to Nigel a loud explosion caused him to shut his mouth and drop to the ground. He could hear the shouts and ranting of heretics from beyond their flimsy barrier ""Hold them back!"" they shouted over and over again, ever quick on the uptake, began feeding shells into the gun. It didn't take long for the chaos marines to find them and soon they were just as pinned under heavy fire. ""The Astartes aren't going to make it!"" Nigel cried looking at Ryan in desperation. Wondering what his partner meant Ryan looked to the alter and saw the sorcerer, for there was no doubt that what the person was, performing some kind of right. Gritting his teeth in frustration Ryan turned to Nigel and saw him stand up and spring himself over the barricade. Either Nigel was ten times the soldier he gave himself credit to be or he was the luckiest bastard Ryan had ever seen. Only a few bullets grazed him and he sprinted his entire way to the sorcerer, all the while drawing his bayonet knife. Nigel screamed praise to the Emperor as he drove the six inch knife into a seam on the sorcerer's armor. Blood spurted out and covered Nigel's forearms as a bullet ripped through his collar bone. Within moment he was swimming down into blackness, he never even felt the floor hit him.

Moments later Ryan stood at attention before an Astartes Librarian as his mind was probed for traces of chaos. All around him marines were securing the church and extracting the relic also cleansing it of any lingering taint. Nigel had been severely wounded but could recover if taken to the proper facilities. ""Your mind and soul are clear guardsmen."" The librarian said calmly ""I must say I'm impressed, Ryan was sure it was something else; it would be a long road ahead to take this planet back. Even a Librarian couldn't predict everything.

The next day

""Siris

""The supreme general of the Aldmeri Dominion in Hammerfell

""And why was he there? What was he looking for?

""He had a staff, the Staff of Worms.""

""And what was he doing with this staff?""

""The staff was able to reanimate hordes of undead, and absorb his power.""

The generals,

""Quiet! Let the Ebony Warrior continue. Did Telindil succeed in his intentions?""

""No

""And where is this staff? Do you have it with you?""

""No

""Well

""Yes

""A coward?!"" a commander yelled, even you, Siris. Not one of us who have ever crossed blades with that elf have ever returned to this council. The only reason you are here is because you were lucky that he didn't decide to face you!""

The council erupted into chaos once again.

""Order!"" The other general yelled again, who knows what else he can do. If he knows of the location of any other powerful artifacts, or can amass forces of tremendously powerful beasts, who knows what he will pull out of his sleeve next. I am calling for the dismissal of this council. Make sure the spies are out searching for any encampments that hold beasts or locations of other artifacts.""
______

Siris entered his tent once again. Neither Silian nor Aisha were waiting for him. Siris walked towards his giant map of Hammerfell and looked at it. He took his helmet off and placed it on the map. It was quiet... a little too quiet.

He turned his head. Something seemed amiss. He walked toward the entrance to the tent and looked outside to his right and his left. He kept his hand on the hilt of his sword.    After pacing back and forth

*""Must be nothing

He lowered his guard and started walking out of the tent...

When all of a sudden

Siris quickly turned, but the armor the assassin wore was definitely not. It looked exotic, outlandish even. The assassin wasn't tall like the Altmer, and had no tail, so there was no way the swordsman could be a Khajiit assassin hired by the Thalmor.

The unknown swordsman fought like no other Redguard or High Elf he had seen. The assassin jumped back and formed a small firebolt in hand and fired it at Siris, and bashed the head of the assassin with his forearm. The assassin fell to the ground, dropping the sword. The assassin reached toward the sword, but Sirs kicked it far out of reach.

""Who are you?"" Siris questioned the assassin as he pointed his ebony sword towards the assassin's chest.

""If you want to know

Sirs did not know who this man was

Siris lowered his sword as Silian

""Who are you?"" Siris asked.

""My name

He pulled his helmet off.

""Why is a Dark Elf working with the Thalmor?""

""I don't work with the Thalmor, and I were all abducted from Blacklight several years ago. They force me to obey their whim and threaten to kill my family if I do not comply. Now that I've failed, my family is forfeit. They told me they would give me a week to kill you or they will kill my family.""

""Should we listen to this elf?"" one of the Redguard soldiers whispered

""Quiet

""How are you so sure of this?"" Siris asked.

""He's planning another assault, wretched, evil abomination this creature is, but they are holding it in the same camp they are holding my family in. Maybe, if you were to save them, I'll forever be in your debt.""

Siris paced around for a few minutes. Nobody else moved. Siris stopped,

""Where is this camp located?""

Teldryn immediately jumped up
______

After telling the Dunmer's story to the other generals, then it would be wiser to dispatch it before it was released. Siris, after being given a small army under his command, was sent to where Teldryn previously described under the cover of night.
______

""That's it!"" Teldryn quietly said as he gazed over a cliff. ""If I can free my family

""No, ""This isn't your war, you've already been through enough. We need to kill this, wait... what why is the camp empty?

The army walked through the deserted camp.

""They must've known that we were coming."" Aisha said, so they couldn't have been gone for long. Let's look through the tents."" 

Every soldier looked through the tents. About half of them were filled with large cages. Teldryn, but he was looking frantically through the tents. Siris followed him into one of the tents. Teldryn was kneeling. 

In front if him lay a Dark Elf woman and a small Dark Elf girl

Teldryn took his helmet off and started crying. 

""Why would they do this?"" he asked

""You can't trust the Aldmeri Dominion to keep their word

Teldryn stopped.

""Wait

""Hear what?""

Teldryn drew his sword

""I've heard that before."" 

Siris followed Teldryn and yelled to Silian

""Silian! Gather the troops and follow me!""

He then heard a screech. It wasn't very loud

""A bird?"" Siris asked.

""No

A few more specks followed the first one

""Cliff Racers!"" Teldryn yelled.

The stream of specks flew straight towards them. The specks grew larger and they flew closer and closer to the small army. Siris grabbed his bow and quickly shot three down. 

""Ready your bows and fire at will!"" Siris yelled.

Arrows quickly went straight towards the quickly approaching stream of Cliff Racers and many of them fell to the ground. However

Teldryn shot firebolts into the sky as they soared above him and encircled him. He grabbed one of them by their tail, he cut the tail off and dropped onto another one and stabbed its neck as he came down. 

Siris brought one down with his bow. It landed in front of him

Despite their efforts

Silian cut them down with his katana one by one as they descended upon him.

Four Redguards tried to run out of the whirlwind of Cliff Racers. Not long after

Siris fired a few paralysis spells and the Racers affected crashed down to the ground

""There's too many of them!"" a Redguard yelled.

""There's got to be something we can do!"" yelled a Breton.

Siris shouted

""Fus Ro Dah!"" 
and opened a large pathway as Cliff Racers fell

""I don't know what that was

Siris took a few minutes to calm his mind

""Fus Ro Dah!""

and many more plummeted to their deaths before they regained their flight. Arrows continued to be fired into the Cliff Racers

The soldiers started cheering.

Teldryn took his helmet off and walked away from the small army. He walked over to a small tree

""Thank you Teldryn

Teldryn said nothing.

""Teldryn

Teldryn slowly nodded

""I'll have an escort ready to take you back to Morrowind

""No, correct? If I were to just take my leave, I would not be doing what's right. I think that my wife and child would want me to fight them.""

The sun began to rise.

""Well

""In Azura's name

He took his helmet

Part I",5,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeasanNPC/comments/1a7541/skyrim_the_real_story_of_ragnar_the_red_part_i/,"Life used to be simple. In the legion, you never had to parcel out the complex motives of the factions around you. You were a weapon of the empire, what they pointed you toward, and you had your orders. That was it. Occasionally you got food. Occasionally you got paid. It was the best of times, my friend Rorik and I got discharged from the legion. Honorably
Rorik decided to settle down, surely there was something worth doing. So, I sold my sword for awhile. I used the nickname I’d gotten in the legion to get some attention: Ragnar the Red. Apparently it was some sort of crazy seeing my flaming red hair match the blood on my axe. Got on good for awhile too, I was living the simple life again. 

Then I met Her. 

I was clearing out the lowlifes from what looked like yet another hole in the ground. I was just about to head out, into a massive cavern with a single, solitary pillar in the middle of a shallow lake. Built up around the base of this monolith was some scaffolding, and bridges to adjoining caves.  While I was admiring the view, some form of scum started taking potshots at me, running about on the scaffolding like he guarding something other than two weeks supply of firebrand wine. I charged the bastard, but he hopped off and ran like a rabbit into one of the adjoining caves. Presumably to get his buddies. Bloody cowards, I took off after him. After taking down a few of the braver men posting guard, backstabbing curs. They died as such too. On a whim

They had an entire fighting arena set up! Bloody hell
What was the oddest part of the scene was the grim silence. They were all gathered around the arena
Speaking of which
The bandits turned as a group
“Meet Ragnar the Red
The element of surprise was on my side
It was with some surprise I looked over the arena walls to see the girl and the plated man still circling. The man swung again, spun around, and decapitated the man. Woah. 
I opened the gate and walked down slowly. 

“How’d a girl like you end up in a place like this?”
She looked at me in contempt
“I lost my knife.”

Not a day goes by that I don't replay that scene in my head. The child walks in, they wouldn't defect. They can't.

My leg doesn't hurt as much today. I should be able to explore this blasted cavern soon enough. Then maybe I'll be able to find something. Something to eat, actually...

~~~

Hobbling around this cave is terrible. An insult for a man like me. At the least Hydreigon has found prey in here

I wonder what the child is doing. Consorting with my traitor

I found sunlight today. Finally got a look at what the cave did to me,stand the sunlight. I had to recall it to the Pokeball. Can't return to civilization, somebody would recognize me. Hydreigon will have to continue hunting.

Last week the triplets found me

I will have control of Unova yet, have come across a more potent beast than what I had to work with last time. It just needs a little encouragement. N and that destructive child left Unova and haven't been heard from since, which is well enough. There's nobody left to get in my way, and this country will belong to me.

My husband called from the other room: ""Hadra! Could you come help me for a minute?"" I walked over. He was hauling a few planks and a bucket of nails. He handed me the bucket. ""Here

I quickly carried the nails to the door and went to grab a hammer. I could hear the sounds of battle from outside. Our house was close to the city gate. It was the second one on the left. My husband and I bought it a little over 6 months ago. We named it Breezehome

Horgnar was quite rich. He was a member of the companions, and we both agreed that that would be too hard.

Horgnar had put the first plank in front of the door

A loud cracking sound came from outside. Horgnar grabbed our wood-chopping axe from besides the door. Then the soldiers kicked down the door. Splinters came flying everywhere. The soldiers came through the door

Horgnar charged at them with the axe. He hit the first one in the neck

He walked over to me and grabbed my wrists. I tried to kick him, which quickly faded as I stabbed the knife into his neck. He fell to his knees, still holding me by my hand. Tears were streaming down my face at this moment. I looked at my husband. He was laying on the ground and was looking in my general directon, eyes wide open, and clenching the sword that was still sticking from his chest.

I don't remember much from what happened after that, and when they didn't, I scratched them, bit them, and told them they were everything that was bad and ugly.

My life was destroyed. But I didn't give up. I trained and trained in the companion's courtyard, and that's when I decided that it was time.

""Can you spare one for me, I handed it over to Ivan. 
""Thank you, meditative puff before asking ""Seen anything tonight?"" 
I laughed sarcastically. ""Ivan, I'm hungry, and I need to sleep. What do you think?"" 
Ivan, comrade. I've heard rumors... rumors of the allies pushing back our forces. I thought I heard a helicopter tonight, and I almost thought I saw lights in the woods. I... I..."" 
""...have been letting the cold and stress get to my brain"" I finished for him. ""Ivan, barely big enough to fire the Kalashnikov strapped across his back. ""Once we get back to the barracks, when Gregori and Pyotr come to relieve us, we're going to get two nice big bowls of borsht, have a good game of cards, and forget about all of this, da? You are new here. When I first arrived, nothing is going to happen to us. The war is far away
He seemed to relax a bit, Dmitri."" For a few minutes, neither of us spoke. 
I thought back to when I was conscripted to fight for the Red Army. Back to the day when a huge sergeant showed up at my mother's apartment door with my paperwork, maybe I was much like Ivan as well. I was nervous, jumpy, anxious. But the Red Army had been good to me. At least I had a job, three meals a day, clothes to wear, and money to spend when I finally got back to Tobolsk. Ivan's sudden exclamation shook me back into consciousness.
""Sasha! What's wrong, low, guttural growl. I had never seen her act this way before. Suddenly, with a tremendous snarl, she broke free of Ivan's grasp and ran into the woods. We both chased after her, struggling under our heavy armor to keep up. 
Suddenly, lay Sasha, her white fur cruelly marred by multiple bullet wounds. ""Who... who would do this?"" Ivan moaned. I bent down and looked at the wounds more closely. They were not the tremendous gashes and tears left by the machine guns the Allied GIs used, but rather smaller, rounder wounds. Wounds consistent with a handgun. The thought had hardly formed within my head when I heard three sudden pops. With a cry, Ivan fell to the ground beside Sasha, his helmet pierced and bleeding. A fear such as I had never known gripped me. I ran for my life, moments from the hours of lectures I been forced to sit in on ran through my head. 
""Two .45 caliber pistols."" I ran faster. ""Operating in all environments, I'd be safe. Safety. I had to make it. A sudden, jarring, crashing pain ran up my left leg. I fell headlong into the snow. Pain, searing pain coursed through my leg. I reached down to my leg, and to my horror I felt my knee, or rather what was left of it. I heard footsteps, approaching. With one burst of effort, with a sudden movement
BAM. BAM. My world exploded. Unbelievable pain burst in my chest. She stared at me a second, and with a maniacal laugh, she walked away. I tried to shout for help, but no sound came. I tried to move, but I couldn't. I thought of Ivan, of Sasha. Poor, cold, she walked into the darkness. Darkness.",t5_2vafm,True

I was really angry at one point and needed to go outside to cool my head down. Little did she know that I was saving up money to pay the college bills for the kids

I decided to drive around a few blocks in my car, hitting another car and when I thought he would be out of sight any second he turned left and drove over the sidewalk right in the middle of a crowd. There was blood everywhere! One could hear the people scream in agony, until he drove over the bodies on the ground a second time just to hit a man at the wall, crushing all of his bones.
And me
Like in a state of trance he walked slowly towards some sort of fuse panel and meddled with it. It took him about five seconds. ""When will the cops show up?"" I was thinking to myself as I noticed he was ready to leave the place. The guy, stole it in heart beat and drove off.

Since I couldn't hear any sirens I went into the open. The surrounding was quite enough for me to hear a whispering noise

At least three cruisers with sirens approached my position real fast. I panicked. My boots were soaked in blood, drove through the adjoining, unlighted park (I hit a bus station on the way) and dumped my car in the sea. 

I knew it was a risky move, no press, not even a single bloodstain on the floor. That was the moment I realized I might be crazy.

Of course I didn't tell my wife. Couldn't have. ""I drove my car into to the ocean because I was angry at you!""? Don't be ridiculous! Not to mention all the hallucinations I had along the way. I bought her a new car today, I don't think so. But sometimes you have to make hard decisions, even if it confirms the reputation you had from the start: ""Waitress, another beer for me and my pal please!""",,False,self,1376916487.0,t3_1knvnl
