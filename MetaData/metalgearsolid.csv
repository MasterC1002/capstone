1-The events of MGS5 i.e Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain

2-The coma detailed in the Phantom Pain trailer has nothing to do with the Les Enfant Terribles project. That's already done and dusted.

3- The events shown in the Ground Zeroes trailer take place after Peace Walker(see above and the trailer).  The Phantom Pain takes place 9 years after Ground Zeroes.  The year is **at least 1983** when Big Boss wakes up from the coma shown in the Phantom Pain trailer(s). **That's 11 years after the Les Enfant Terribles Project**.

What events do we know transpired during the 1980s in the Metal Gear universe? Here:

(i)1980: Naomi Hunter rescued by Big Boss and Gray Fox. Big Boss sends Naomi to America. A strong indication that Gray Fox will be in MGSV.

(ii) Raiden born in the early 80s.

(iii) In the late 80s, partakes in the Liberian Civil war. Indicates that Big Boss' clones are capable of fighting during this time period.

(iv) VR developed.

**Some obvious info that can be gathered from the trailers:**

The Ground Zeroes trailer talks of a ""UN nuclear inspection"" of Mother Base. **This is most likely a trap:**

-[""The Trojan Horse's in""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltH1eWxZutE&amp;t=05m24s) i.e The trap has been set up.

-Burnt-face XOF commander hides their identity([removes XOF logo from the choppers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltH1eWxZutE&amp;t=05m15s) and their [uniforms)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltH1eWxZutE&amp;t=06m31s) before departing. Maybe so that they can literally land on Mother Base and attack from the inside.

[""The pirate crackdown's a go""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltH1eWxZutE&amp;t=05m38s) i.e Lets kill these mercenaries once and for all.

The ""inspection"" is actually XOF launching a surprise attack on Mother Base and subsequently destroying it. XOF may be responsible for Big Boss' 9 year coma.

**Something not so obvious:**

Both Phantom Pain trailers and the gameplay would suggest that **the supernatural entities seen invading the hospital are not there to kill Big Boss

(i) The XOF soldiers invading the hospital seem to be killing everyone with knowledge that Big Boss is there. They clearly want to kill Big Boss. [If you view this segment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqA37wGqg9Q&amp;t=02m03s) of the original Phantom Pain trailer, the clip changes. Now, we see the same hallway in flames with Big Boss still alive and no XOF soldiers to be seen.  **The fiery phantom quite clearly killed the XOF soldiers just as they were about to kill Big Boss**.

(ii)That [fiery whale phantom](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqA37wGqg9Q&amp;t=02m34s) also destroys what's most likely an XOF chopper

(iii)Finally

Props to /u/DrunkenSavior for [the following contribution](http://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1b69sw/an_attempt_to_clean_this_mess_up/c947ayd): 


**I'm actually thinking the exact time-period for Big Boss' 9-year coma is 1980-1989.**

1974 - Peace Walker Incident

1980 - After the Rhodesian Bush War (July 1964 - Dec 1979)

Late 1980s - Outer Heaven fortress formed.

Late 1980s - Big Boss takes control of FOXHOUND.

Another event that could have occurred around this time period was Big Boss rescuing Frank Jaeger during the Mozambican Civil War. However

**It's hard to find any other 9-year period in the Metal Gear timeline where Big Boss is inactive that fits between Peace Walker(1974) and Metal Gear (1995).**

**On a side note

a) It means that the Les Enfants Terribles program would be 17 years old, which takes place in 1995 which makes Snake 24 years old.

b) If Big Boss does wake up in 1989, and Big Boss himself is 54.

* Metal Gear Solid 2
* Metal Gear Solid 3
* Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops*
* Metal Gear Solid 4
* Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker
* Metal Gear Rising*

**The titles with a * next to them are voted *most optional* by fans and are not necessarily needed to enjoy the story to its full potential.** Starting with Metal Gear Solid 1 is *perfectly* fine. You don't need MG1 and MG2 to understand the story
___________________

* The **[Legacy Collection](http://www.amazon.com/Metal-Gear-Solid-Collection-Playstation-3/dp/B00CTKHXFO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1376545415&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=metal+gear+solid+legacy+collection)** is very helpful to someone who has never played any games in the series nor owns any of them. This will provide you with **Metal Gear, Metal Gear Solid 3: HD Edition, Metal Gear Solid 4 Trophy Edition and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker HD Edition.** That's an astounding deal, just saying. It also includes Metal Gear Solid 1 and VR Missions voucher codes.

* Alternatively, and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker.**

* Metal Gear Solid 1 is available on the PlayStation Network for $9.99 and is definitely worth the price for the convenience of being able to play it on your PS3 if you no longer own a PS2 and you have a PS3 model

* Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2 are tough and rewarding games on their own, and a lot of other people have started with Metal Gear Solid 1 and then followed the series after that. 

_______________

If you really want to be a rebel

* Metal Gear Solid 3
* Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops
* Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker
* Metal Gear
* Metal Gear 2
* Metal Gear Solid 1
* Metal Gear Solid 2
* Metal Gear Solid 4
* Metal Gear Rising

And if you're curious by year:

* 1964 – Snake Eater
* 1970 – Portable Ops
* 1974 – Peace Walker
* 1995 – Metal Gear
* 1999 – Metal Gear 2
* 2005 – Metal Gear Solid
* 2007 – Sons of Liberty
* 2009 – Sons of Liberty (cont.)
* 2014 – Guns of the Patriots
* 2018 – Metal Gear Rising


Please realize if you play the games in this order

Edit: Okay, the submission hasn't even been seen. If anybody needed convincing that a merger was required, that's it right there, y'ask me. In the interest of fairness to the other sub, however, I'll wait until 24 hours has passed since making this suggestion, and then I'll get onto the mods of both subs concerned.

Edit 2: Alright

&gt; Hi there Killerzeit/mezzism/SnakeLinkSonic/Deadlypuf/Yen24/Ganonsfoot/dbarts21/DOOMz_illa!

&gt; I'm contacting you regarding an idea I proposed in [/r/metalgearsolid]...(http://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/16k2hf/proposed_merger_with_rmetalgear/) and [/r/metalgear](http://www.reddit.com/r/metalgear/comments/16k2e4/proposed_merger_with_rmetalgearsolid/) to overwhelmingly positive response; users are interested in the possibility of merging these two subreddits. Specifically
/r/metalgearsolid would be renamed /r/metalgear

&gt; Users have brought up concerns regarding who the moderator duties should fall to

&gt; Please see the discussion [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/16k2hf/proposed_merger_with_rmetalgear/) for  more information

&gt; Yours sincerely

&gt; Cee-Jay

It's all in their hands now, I think. Also, I've glanced the activity of each mod, and found /u/Deadlypuf's appointment to the position to be most curious, considering his/her overall activity...

Anyway

1371030409.0,1g6qgx,**The Official Metal Gear Solid V ARG Thread**,GarlicJockey,137,15,200,"**UPDATE JULY 4th:  THE FAN-MADE PAIN?**

A few days ago, but a quick analysis of the videos proves them to be unusually well thought-out.  **(TL;DR?  Either it's all legit, or the Troll is completely fucking nuts.  Either way, it might be worth investigating further.  If not simply for the sake of fun.)**

The shorter video

* Morse text in the video title reads - ""APARTHEID"". (South Africa's long-running racial segregation enforced by the National Party.  Escalating resistance led to a State Of Emergency in the mid 1980's.  Metal Gear lore in mind

* The audio plays out like a shortwave radio interception.  African beer commercial music and some shifting radio frequencies followed by a string of morse - ""THE UPRIESING HAS STARTED"" (RIES could be a Kojima in-joke.  Kind of like the whole ""Did you rike it??"" thing.  RIES = LIES.)

The other video

* Before the song begins

* Halfway through the song

* [This image](http://i.imgur.com/IsQDr5V.jpg) flashes on screen for 1 frame near the beginning of the video.  It's an Adobe Premiere screenshot reminiscent of [this teaser](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BF3zZd7CIAEUHeH.jpg:large) Kojima posted before GDC.  This time, but it would be a HUGE pain in the ass.  [Here is a translation](http://i355.photobucket.com/albums/r463/Frank_W_Pliskin/translate_zpsae8a8c6d.jpg) by /u/Pliskin683.

* [This text](http://i.imgur.com/rRCmikO.jpg) appears while the keystrokes are heard.  We see the user moving into the lita 01 directory, then running it
Assembly code is about as close as you can get to editing ones and zeros on a machine and it often used if you want something to run very fast, it's highly likely that that's what loop2.exe is.

* In MGSV context, ""Good"" Lita having her home invaded.  In order to take revenge on her attackers, she transforms into ""Bad"" Lita, complete with a slick leather jacket.  The (awful) video for her *first* album's first track involves Lita hiring two doctors to kidnap a man.  They knock him unconscious and bring him to a hospital where he is transformed into Lita's guitar.

* [This text](http://i.imgur.com/2r9qOAA.jpg) appears while the beeping pattern is heard.  The information is directly linked to the medical codes in the YouTube description.  Web-searching these codes provides a lot of interesting information regarding neurological treatments for Phantom Limb Syndrome.  Information that seems *very* relevant to MGSV

* [This photo](http://i.imgur.com/E6Cf29w.jpg) flashes on screen for 1 frame.  It's an xray from a real medical case where a Chinese man had his *right eye* impaled by a large *hook*.

* [More text](http://i.imgur.com/5Pjf4hF.jpg) referencing the medical codes in the YouTube description.  No apparent source for the animation playing in the background.

* [This photo](http://i.imgur.com/U9RIQkL.jpg) of an old prosthetic arm used by the Army during and after WWII (another flash-frame).  It's nearly identical to the hook worn by Big Boss in MGSV.

* [An error message](http://i.imgur.com/KkonP4H.jpg) appears while loud klaxons sound off in the background.  Nothing much to see here.

* [An error code](http://i.imgur.com/rq4KSaa.jpg) immediately follows the error message.  If there *is* an ARG

* [Another flash-frame.](http://i.imgur.com/2dX4GTe.jpg)  This one is a shrapnel injury from the Korean War.

* [And one more.](http://i.imgur.com/RdK91cg.jpg)  Another Chinese head-trauma case.  This kid survived having a sword *thrown* 5 centimeters into his skull.

**SO

While not officially acknowledged by KojiPro, and the audio sounds professionally mixed.  It's obvious that somebody put a lot of work into this.  Maybe Kojima's ""Project Ogre"" isn't a video game at all, but an Alternate Reality Game revolving around a ""Troll"" theme.

There is

For anyone genuinely interested in this

* Identify /u/_DD_LLC_.  This guy has been stirring up mystery on several boards, and most recently ""Rev Pi (SCI, T_KEYHOLE: SIGINT:""

* Translating the Adobe screenshot.

* Checking out the hacking article and seeing if it could be used with any information we currently have.

* Analyzing the audio with Spectrogram software

  
 
*If you discover anything of interest
 
 

**WHAT WE NEED TO DO**

ARGs for video games almost always lead to a reward.  This is typically a release date, etc.), or exciting new information about the game.

There is likely a message hidden in all these codes that will help move things forward

* An IP Address leading to a website involved in the ARG.

* A phone number leading to a voicemail with new ARG information.

* Geological coordinates leading to a physical location with a GeoCache. (Coordinates have already been found.  See ""Other Theories and Discoveries"" below.  There may be another set of more accessible coordinates hidden in the code.)

**USING A CIPHER**

A cipher is a method of encoding/decoding information.  The most simple cipher is replacing letters with their corresponding number in the alphabet (A=1, etc.).  Most real ciphers are *much* more complicated, but they almost always involve some method of substitution.  Usually, decoding a cipher involves a keyword or password.

A cipher grid is used to organize the characters in a message so they can be more easily viewed in rows or columns.  Most cipher grids are square

A really great collection of browser-based cipher tools can be found **[HERE](http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/)**.  They're pretty easy to use

**CIPHER IN THE TRAILER?**

Somebody in another forum pointed out that, but somebody should probably double-check (sometimes the underscore sits halfway between two letters).  There are a few instances where it's kind of vague.  The letters are:

I A Y O I O U E H R P R E U L E P E R N N A A I A S K O S C O D U H V I H N E E M N

A total of 42 letters.  Incidentally

A C C A C Q T M V T E S T T W T X K E E V E N T M A C H R U N R E R U N S E C T O R

A total of 42 letters!  But wait

The string of letters from the trailer is very close to the Friedman-IC for English,000 different English words you can spell with those letters.

This is pretty clear evidence that, the letters might have to be combined, there's several ways it could be approached.  

We're getting closer!

* [UPC codes for ""J.D. Ice Cream""](http://i.imgur.com/8oN9NF8.png) (J.D. is the core of the Patriot's AI)

There are some other interesting ideas.  All of the trailers feature a strange lens-flare that resembles a DNA sequence

**Kojima Be Trollin'**

- *Kojima Never Says Kiefer's Playing Big Boss*

[Yes he does](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=zp5Kxp7asbc). ""The game takes place in 1984, or even Solidus Snake. So unless there's another ""Snake"" out there that happens to be the same age as Big Boss in the same time frame(which is very unlikely) we can make the safe assumption that Kojima's confirming Kiefer as Big Boss.

- *Kiefer Never Says He's Playing Big Boss*

[Yes he does](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=zp5Kxp7asbc). ""Trying to isolate ""What does **Snake** want for the future? And how does the past weigh on him?"" I highly doubt he's talking about an 11 Year-Old Clone weighing on the past. 

- *We never see Kiefer do any Mo-Cap*

[Yeah we do](http://i.imgur.com/CKLwFKm.gif).

- *Every Interview Looks Fake*

That's subjective. Not evidence. And a lot of people are confusing the two. Evidence would be finding a video recording, and shoving it down everyone's throats. When the evidence outweighs your gut feeling, then you have to sit back and keep it to yourself because you aren't contributing anything to your cause. And just like the Moon Landing, there's more evidence to support that Kiefer voicing Big Boss is real than your ""gut feeling"". So please, find some evidence if you're so sure that your gut feeling is right.

**Hayters Gonna' Hate!**

- *Hayter Pulled off Old Snake's Voice

Well that would lead to some inconsistencies. First of all you can't have David Hayter's Big Boss talking to Hayter's Solid Snake in Outer Heaven. That's a bit much from a narrative standpoint. Also, nor Liquid were had the exact DNA of Big Boss otherwise Liquid could have Hijacked SOP earlier in the game. I mean look at [Old Snake and Big Boss](http://i.imgur.com/M32WvJT.jpg). I even gave them similar features to help the comparison, and they still don't look EXACTLY alike. They're not the same person, therefore they don't require the same voice.



- *The Franchise is Ruined without Hayter*

No it's not. Namely because David Hayter didn't direct, but still a voice actor. The gameplay, story, graphics, and immersion that makes the franchise world renown are still there and the game itself won't have any less quality than previous titles.

- *I Refuse to Buy this Game!*

Ok

- *Kojima Screwed David Hayter!*

I wouldn't say he *screwed* anybody. As someone in total creative control Kojima has the right to choose whomever he wants if he feels that decision will creative a better gaming experience. It's been said that Mr. Sutherland was chosen because he's better-suited to portray emotions through facial movements than Mr. Hayter. With David Hayter being a *Professional* VA, Video Games, etc. However when The Dark Knight was in development they didn't choose Mark Hamill, they chose Heath Ledger. Why? Because while Mark Hamill is a damn fine VA and for many people The penultimate Joker, Heath Ledger was better suited for the job. And to this day Heath Ledger's performance is still revered. The same applies here, Kiefer Sutherland is able to bring something to the table that David Hayter simply can't. And it's going to make a better experience as a result. Did Mark Hamill ever go on Twitter and make a huge fuss about it? No. He didn't. Because that's not what Professionals do.

**Details from the E3 pre-show(to be filled during/after):**

* Game takes place in 1984

* Snake is 49 years old.

* Race and Revenge are the two themes for this game

* Kiefer Sutherland voices Snake. Hayter was not mentioned at all.

* Huge emphasis on facial features and ""feeling"" what the characters are going through.

* ""Tension-packed experience""

...that's about it. Will watch again to see if I missed anything

**Final thoughts**

All of the stuff leading up to this - the tweets showing them working on a trailer, either at Microsoft's conference or Sony's. At least the wait isn't TOO long this time.

Being young and dumb I played through that game

Fastforward 6 years later i'm on a crappy late shift at work. While on my break I see the MGS HD collection on sale for a great price. I thought

When I tell the assistant manager of my purchase he is in shock that I haven't even touched the first game. The next day he comes in with the original PS version of MGS. 

I've finally finished it and my word i've been blown away. The story

If i wasn't working tomorrow i'd be playing MGS2 again but that must wait for another day.

I know you lot probably don't care but I feel so pumped after playing MGS that I needed to speak to someone (and i'm sure the rents wouldn't appreciate being woken up at 1:17am).

TL;DR- Finally got round to playing MGS after only playing MGS2.

As most of you know Phantom pain sensations are described as perceptions that an individual experiences relating to a limb or an organ that is not physically part of the body.

Now if we take Metal Gear Solid i.e. The Body and take away David Hayter i.e. The Limb. Then technically everyone that wants David back is experiencing a Phantom pain.

-Call Para-Medic enough times and eventually Para-Medic will start wondering why Ocelot

-Again, I.E the Woman/Doctor who started the process to clone Snake. http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid_3_radio_conversations#Cloning Heres the transcript. Thank you Jeremy_Sunshine

-All Cobra unit members blew up after you kill them. The Boss didn't. I'll let you think about that one for a while. [Just FYI on this one. We all know she's dead. And there are a few good reasons why she didn't implode. I just think its still an interesting thing to ponder about]

-Kuwabara Kuwabara, such as The Sorrow. When Volgin died, The Sorrow (again, a spirit) was present and Volgin avoided the phrase. 

-Ever wonder what happened to the real Eva? Make your way to the Granin Research facility. You'll find yourself in the area where you fight The Fear but keep in mind this is at night and the very first time you enter the area. There will be a dead scientist hanging near the entrance to the Granin zone. The scientist was trying to escape but fell for a trap

-When fighting The Fear take a fake death pill. After The Fear examines you he will turn his back. Revive and throw a stun grenade. As he is stunned start shooting with a LETHAL weapon (like a machine gun). The Fear will die from STAMINA depletion. Any damage he takes while stunned takes away his stamina bar not his health bar. 

-If you have a Russian Glowcap equipped and call Para-Medic she will tell you (as a joke) that if  you eat one it'll recharge your batteries. Eat one while your batteries are low. Call Para-Medic again. Snake will tell Para-Medic she was right his batteries were recharged. Para-Medic will then talk to Sigint behind Snakes back

-Snake doesn't like Sonic because Hedgehogs are the natural hunters of Snakes. 

-Editted for some errors. ",self,t5_2s4hr,1375205331.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1jbw3g/mgs3_type_secrets_for_all/

The new stylesheet is finally done. Welcome to the redesigned Motherbase! You have no idea how stressed I was to make everything look as good as possible once I realized that almost everyone wanted this stylesheet to be used in this sub.  
  
My main influence for this css came from MGS3 title screen and MGS4 database app. I wanted to things to look a bit mysterious and dark since the series itself gives me these kind of vibes at times. I'm a big fan of Yoji Shinkawa and since his artwork is so iconical

1375678503.0,1jq0wl,How I would have re-written the B&amp;B Unit.,flashmedallion,67,13,43,"One of the more universally noted low-points of MGS4 was the B&amp;B Unit.  While I think there were some interesting elements to the how and why they were featured in the game

To summarise what I think *did* work about them:

 - The general metaphor for what they represented was sound.  It's the logical conclusion of everything the series has said about what war does to people, was a good idea.  It just wasn't really built on.

 - Their mechanical/ludic construction, share the codenames of the MGS1 and MGS3 bosses, and the arenas you fight them in, as well as their respective styles of combat, also hearken back to previous bosses in various combinations.  As an example, Laughing Octopus takes her codename from Decoy Octopus, her ""emotion"" from The Joy, which recalls Solidus as well.  Her battle itself is most evocative of the fight with Grey Fox in MGS1 - taking place in a research lab

 - They also share many parallels with Old Snake.  Traumatised by war, but also his psyche to an extent (Snakes Psyche being a fundamental element of the game).  I think this is both the strongest and most unfortunately underplayed elements of the characters, and with some minor revision would make them so much stronger and resonant in the overall scheme of things.

---

So what am I wanting to change?

In a nutshell, extending that to encompass their trauma (which as it is written has no connection to anything), and using it to reflect Snakes journey as we progress through the game.

As I see it

Octopus up first needs relatively little rewriting.  Her ""laughing"" is a response to the absurdity of war.  The pure random stupidity of it all.  There are lighter notes in MGS ranging from quirky humour, I'm not saying Octopus should have been cracking jokes, just that she should have specifically addressed some of the existential absurdity of the horror in Snakes past.  Snake as a character doesn't really address this stuff directly, and he shouldn't.  That's not what he does.  But we could get a better glimpse of his pain through his reflection in Octopus.

Raven up next is perfectly placed in terms of the plot development.  We encounter and fight her right after a rather big info-dump for Snake.  Snake has just learned, trauma and struggles are the result of a someone else's personal grudges.  After that, his mother figure is gravely injured.  Again, Snake doesn't need to be flying into a rage about the whole situation - that's not his character - but a Raven who has been through something similar, a backstory where she was made to suffer all through the political machinations of people she's never met, for their own profit, could be consumed with an impotent rage about her helplessness.  Again

I'm sure you see where I'm going with this

Wolf's trauma should come from the sorrow of never being able to return to her golden years.  Just about any kind of backstory would work here, her home was destroyed by whatever conflict.  That haunting sorrow of nostalgia discoloured by regret and loss is heavy in the Shadow Moses sequence, but again Snake doesn't express it directly.  This should be echoed through Wolfs trauma.

Mantis should express the utter incomprehension of it all.  The insanity that is induced by layers and layers of conspiracy, and the octagonal arena in the bowels of the ship that recalls Arsenal) feed into this personally, along with the nanomachines, which must be directly overcome to defeat Mantis (the only time you are forced to use the Syringe) would position Mantis to reflect the pure insanity of what Snake has been through.

So yeah, remember).  

&gt;""*SNAAAAAKKKEE! You're a TOOL.  A WEAPON

^(Please excuse my atrocious Metal Gear dialogue)

Once the Beauty comes out she's in awe of how Snake has overcome his trauma, it actually makes Sense when Drebin tells Snake that he's freed the beauties, because they actually get some psychological peace before they die at Snake's hands.  And they get that from Snake the character as an extension of the player, because the player has overcome the taunting and the reality of Snakes history and won the battle none-the-less.  Drebin can still give a little backstory and the player can then realize where each beast was actually coming from - they've experienced the same trauma as Snake, but they weren't strong enough to overcome it.

The Raven speech should genuinely piss you off - you should feel ashamed for playing MGS

1355178338.0,14mncl,An Alternative theory to MGS5,st0567,66,11,55,"There's really only been talk about this being Big Boss in the Phantom Pain

We are supposed to believe this character is Big Boss, but this Character is as well. He is a clone of Big Boss. The fifth (V) snake.

Solid and Liquid came in pairs, the genetically manipulated (nature) clones, while Solidus and V are environmentally manipulated (nurture) attempts to make The Ultimate Soldier and the Ultimate Leader, respectively.

From [Solidus](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Solidus_Snake) on the wiki:
&gt;The creation of the original clones led to Big Boss's departure from the Patriots. Thus

However, was supposed to be this figure head. Solidus was an attempt to hone a perfect clone as the ultimate soldier version of Big Boss (as it was unknown how well the dominant or recessive clone would do at this point). He was sent to fight at a young age (as a teenager according to the wiki) in the Liberian Civil War. V was supposed to be the new figurehead; in fact he would be the most ""manipulated"" of any of the clones.

V needed all the experiences of Big Boss in order to truly lead like him

This theory then branches out into two different options (I think b is more likely

A: Big Boss finds out about V, which is why ""Big Boss"" becomes evil.

B: Big Boss finds out about V. He was already angry about Solid and Liquid, which is how he becomes perceived as evil. He also kills V in the process. This theory also leads to some nice parallels with the boss. Some scenes in the trailer could be a combination of Big Boss's anti-V team and hallucinations, giving the illusion/reality that Big Boss leads a supernatural squad, like the boss. He also becomes perceived as evil similar to the boss.

The death of V leads to the failure of ""The Figure Head"" clone

This also makes the name *The Phantom Pain* very relevant. 

From [Wikipedia]:

&gt;Phantom pain sensations are described as perceptions that an individual experiences relating to a limb or an organ that is not physically part of the body.

The ""Phantom Pain"" being experienced is the brain. Big Boss's brain. The clone is experiencing mostly the painful memories from the organ he does not have.",self,t5_2s4hr,1355200612.0,,Slds,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/14mncl/an_alternative_theory_to_mgs5/

1358739326.0,16yuzx,Announcement regarding the subreddit merger proposal. ,Killerzeit,69,16,20,"Hello

I will say this up-front

**I have decided to NOT go through with a merger at this time.**

Please let me explain

1) I saw an argument for r/metalgear being a better name for the subreddit as it would encompass not only the Metal Gear Solid works, r/cheeseburgers, with r/hamburgers, because r/cheeseburgers doesn't do justice to hamburgers, which simply isn't true.

2) I also saw some argument that r/metalgear would be easier to find. Again, and shy of 1,000 subscribed over there. 3,000+ subscribers have joined within the last six months. I'm going to take a shot in the dark and say that because there were active users, and I was an active moderator, adding CSS and flair and other luxuries, that people decided to subscribe. I can't say that I think telling everyone from r/metalgearsolid to move to r/metalgear seems wise, or even convenient. What I would see happening is that I'd tell everyone to go over there

3) I would be losing something I like doing. As the subreddit exists now, friendly, and coherent, which I am very proud of. There are posts that get stuck in the spam filter for absolutely no reason, sure, but there are hardly reports for any harsh comments or spam posts because they simple just don't exist over here. For that, I'm a really lucky moderator, in the future

So... I like what I have nurtured and created. Basically handing that away to other moderators is not what is ideal right now. I have seen too many subreddits go downhill after adding too many moderators and trying to fix so many things that were not even wrong in the first place, ""Hey, r/metalgearsolid, we need to talk..."" or ""Hey! r/metalgearsolid, a word with you?"" because I think it's stupid.

I live by the philosophy that if there is nothing wrong, merged.

I hope that you can understand why I don't want to go through with the merger and respect my decision as a moderator, I'm just a user, too. I try to not do things that I see that I don't like, and just go from there - taking your ideas and suggestions and making this place into what it is.

Anyway

Evidence supporting this theory:

* The bandaged man says call me Ishmael. The bandaged man is also voiced by Sutherland. Many have already speculated the Bandaged Man is part of Big Bosses Psyche

* Ahab loses his leg to the whale. Big Boss doesn't lose his leg

* Ahab has his leg replaced by a prosthetic; Kaz does as well.

* ""From Fox two phantoms were born"" - Ishmael is the biblical son of Abraham, two different ideologies. Ishmaels mother was also cast out, similar to how the Boss was abandoned by her country.

* Ishmael is the main character in Moby Dick

* Kaz talks about revenge being their goal. Ahab's motivation is revenge.

This last point could apply to either big boss or Kaz

* More Biblical info: Biblical Ahab has 4 encounters with prophets, the third with **Eli**jah again, and the fourth with Micaiah.

Some speculation about this point: 

This fourth one is interesting. Here's a quote about it from wikipedia:
&gt; The fourth encounter is with Micaiah, first assures Ahab he will be successful and ultimately gives Ahab a glimpse into God's plan for Ahab to die in battle

This quote could be interesting when viewed in context of Metal Gear Solid. We don't know who Micaiah is, and that plan in MGS1 is to take down the patriots. Miller would most likely agree with that, and he is being guaranteed success of the mission, he might be willing to die in MGS1. Ahab also dies while in disguise, which could be a hint at liquid being in disguise. We also know miller had dogs in his home, and when Ahab died, dogs were licking at his blood.

Well feel free to add to this theory

EDIT: A few interesting points as well

* Elijah is a charachter in Moby Dick. I haven't read the book yet (it's on my summer reading!)

* u/davidsomerset said 
&gt; There are also some interesting points to do with Ahab's interactions with another character called ['Captain Boomer'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Dick#Captain_Boomer). Boomer lost an arm to Moby Dick but has come to terms with his loss

This point could lead to some good speculation too.",self,t5_2s4hr,1371660446.0,,Slds,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1gloyd/mgsv_theory_kaz_is_ahab_big_boss_is_ishmael/

Quick Reference of best missions for each soldier type:
RnD: Extra Ops 49  
Mess Hall: Extra Ops 46  
Medical: Extra Ops 26  
Intel: Main Ops 08   


***MISSIONS***  

**[Main Ops] 05 - Rescue Chico** (1 S-Rank Intel troop)  
&gt;In Camino de Lava: Junction, tranq the two mooks at ground level, then sneak around the left-hand side and place a Fulton Mine under the sniper and shoot it, or if you have the Carl Gustav (Fulton Recovery), you may as well just take him like that. Those are your only two options for recovering this soldier.  

**[MO] 08 - Destroy the Barricade** (2 S-Rank Intel troops)  

&gt;In this one, or place Fulton Mines at the base of the cliff directly underneath each sniper, then shoot the mine to trigger it. After this, complete the mission normally.  


**[Extra Ops] 26 - Eliminate Enemy Soldiers** (1 S-Rank Medical P.O.W.)  

&gt;Make your way to the other end of the map. After going down the narrow alley with a sniper at the other end, not worth recruiting.  


**[EO] 46 - Perfect Stealth** (1 S-Rank Mess Hall, numerous B-Ranking soldiers of various units)
  
&gt;In the first map
In the next area, who incidentally is either an A- or S-Ranked Intel trooper. Remove the regular mooks on the ground from the equation, then C.Gustav (FR) or Fulton Mine him.

&gt;Instead of going to the objective, who patrols behind the truck up the hill, is an A-Rank RnD trooper. The soldier patrolling the unreachable catwalk a little further on is a B-Rank Mess Hall trooper, if you want that. You'll need to Fulton Gustav or Fulton Mine him though. The next soldier along, near the end of the map, is an A-Rank Medical Unit trooper, again you'll need to Gustav or Fulton Mine him as you can't reach him to place a Fulton balloon in person. There's nothing special inside the Mill

&gt;In Los Cantos: Canyon, has an A-Rank in Medical. There's nothing special in Los Cantos: Ridge, but in Fuerte La Ladera, the soldier on the right on top of the battlements has an A-Rank in Mess hall.  

**[EO] 47 - Perfect Stealth** (1 A-Rank Intel

&gt;There are many B-Ranking Intel soldiers in this mission, but the other one who is slighlty closer but on the far left side, has the A-Rank in Intel.

&gt;In Ruinas de Xochiquetzal, and the soldier directly behind him has a B-Rank in Medical. Up to you whether you want to recruit them or not.  

**[EO] 48 - Perfect Stealth** (1 A-Rank RnD
&gt;In the second map

&gt;In the next area, so it's possible to farm A-Rank Combat solders from it.


**[EO] 49 - Perfect Stealth** (2 A-Rank RnD

&gt;As you start
In the next area, then head into the next area.  

&gt;In this area, then finish the mission. The RnD P.O.W.'s almost always morale-up into S-Ranks, and they often have awesome skills like Metamaterials Technology, Anti-Tank Rifle Design, etc. This is the mission you want to farm for RnD recruits.


**[EO] 50 - Perfect Stealth** (1 S-Rank Medical

&gt;There are quite a few B-Rank soldiers in this mission that scrub up very nicely into A- and S-Ranked soldiers
Once you've made your way to El Cenagal: Ravine, as well as some Med Unit skills.  

&gt;All the way in the last map, and some useful skills occasionally.

**[EO] 55 - U.S. Soldier Retrieval** (1 A-Rank RnD soldier)  

&gt;The A-Rank soldier in this mission is the target P.O.W.


**[EO] 75 - Armoured Vehicle Battle: LAV-Type C Custom** (Numerous A-Rank soldiers of various units

&gt;There's no hard and fast rule for A-Rankers here

**[EO] 79 - Tank Battle: T-72 A Custom** (Numerous A-Rank soldiers of various units

&gt;The same goes for this mission as the one before. All the first escorts are A-ranked.


**[EO] 83 - Tank Battle: MBTk-70 Custom** (Numerous A-Rank soldiers of various units

&gt;The same goes for this mission as the one before. All the first escorts are A-ranked.

**[EO] 98 - Tank Battle: MBTk-70 Custom** (Numerous A-Rank soldiers of various units

&gt;The same goes for this mission as the one before. All the first escorts are A-ranked.


**[EO] 100 - Armoured Vehicle Battle: BTR-60 PA Custom** (Numerous A-Rank soldiers of various units

&gt;The same goes for this mission as the one before. All the first escorts are A-ranked.
  
As a general rule of thumb, Intel and Medical soldiers can be found in these missions. The best thing to do is find a mission you're comfortable with and farm recruits from it.


***DETAILS***


You can check the number of soldiers with certain ranks by hovering over a mission and pressing Triangle. Sometimes
(eg. S:?? A:?? B:04 C:08 D:00 E:00). If your Intel Team is high enough


Some of these missions require you to make it to the goal without being spotted or killing a single enemy. But there's no time limit
In the first area alone, use your Analyser, knock out and fulton every soldier who's any good, you'll soon find your Combat, R&amp;D, Mess Hall and Medical Teams growing quickly.
The trick is, A, and B-ranked soldiers. This saves your Fultons for later soldiers who are more powerful, and prevents your base from being clogged up with essentially useless soldiers.


Of course, as well as what items they have in their inventory. It will scan almost immediately.

*Note that even if you have a full Mother Base, you can keep recruiting. If you have more than 350 soldiers at the end of the mission, you will be taken to a screen and asked to dismiss excess soldiers. So don't worry about seeing an A- or S-ranked soldier and having no more room, just recover him anyway.
