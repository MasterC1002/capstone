He goes to bed at ten, and then he changes out of his clothes and goes to bed. He dreams, but never remembers what about. When he wakes up in the morning, he's always slept in, and he hurries to get to school in time. He gets home at thirty six minutes past three and does his homework, and then he returns to his laptop until bed. He likes gummy bears, horror films and music that has screamed vocals. He doesn't really have any friends apart from me, but he knows he wants to go and live in a big city. London

We've lived together for twelve months now, I made so many sacrifices and I don't regret it at all. His parents are nice, but we just spent most of the time up in his room alone. We don't talk like we used to before I moved in, though. Most of the time I just watch him. It's how I know so much about him.

We let go as we walked to the tower, and let go on the elevator ride up. We let go as we gazed out across Paris. We let go of everything. “We’re doing it, Sara.

Some took refuge in the organized madness of conspiracy theories blaming everyone from the UN to the US to the Illuminati for this faked alien invasion.

See, the problem with the slanty-ballerina is that you never quite know when you’re clear of the bike. Drop to flat-foot too soon and you’ll find a trailing strap has wrapped around the handle of the bike and you’ll find yourself dragged backwards into a clanging mess of tyre and spoke. 


That’s why, too presumptuous and I wasn’t safe. Still, I suppose, it’s not really the bike’s fault. Not this time. It couldn’t have been the bike.

Comes a plinking

It pulls you up the darkened stairs

Your mind on ballets

Those metal tines

Are raspy music to your ears.

They whir,

And beckon you toward that room

Where summers stay

Sweet childish memories it sings of.

The dust lies thick upon the floor

To hush your steps so near the door

And moonlight,

But as you reach

And with a plink… 

a plink… 

a plink…

The music stops. You twitch

Then raise your palm

You hold the music box’s key.

So with a shiver,

You turn and drift back down the stairs.

You wonder why you left your chair –

A phone call? A forgotten care?

Then down the hallway

Comes a plinking
