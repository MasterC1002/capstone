- The biggest thing is make sure the app is fun to play. If you don't find the game fun neither will your users.

- Don't release an app before you're done with it. If you're like me you tend you rush the final stages of the app to get it to market soon

- Try to keep the filesize below 25mb if possible. I've found that going above this mark limits the number of downloads. In a perfect world you would want to be around 5mb but that isn't always possible. Going too small though (&lt;1.5mb) can actually lower downloads too as users start to think that such a small app can't be too high quality

- Use some kind of worldwide leaderboard. You can make your own or use a 3rd party but people love to compete against one another. You just took a decent game and made it a good game

- Create a good looking icon

- Fill out every line in the ""STORE LISTING"" section off your app. I've personally found that by filling out every form field that it boosted my apps up quite a bit in the rankings. It could be a fluke...but hey it;s not that hard to fill out a few extra form fields and add some new screenshots for a chance that it works out.

- Incentivise ratings of your app but only after 4 times playing the app. If the user has played your game 4 times they probably like it so show a popup asking them to rate your app. In exchange you will give them some cool feature in your game. Doing so will encourage them to rate your app and since they like it they will probably rate it high. I only ever show 1 popup. Once the user closes it I never bug them again. 

- Fake it till you make it - Using services like getjar or appbrain to advertise your app will drive instant traffic to your app. If you spend 100$ on launch day it should boost your app into google's trending list. Once in trending you should see 1-2k downloads per day while in there. Once you fall out of tending you can use the same method to get in there again. This will cost some money

- Read your competitors comments and figure out what people like and what they don't like and create your app around these comments

- Offer in app purchases that don't force the users to have to buy them but it will enhance the users gameplay. For example if you have a sword and it does 10 damage maybe the in app purchase can be for a better sword that does 20 damage. 

- Don't be afraid of ads instead of paid apps. I've made close to 5


EDIT: MORE TIPS

- With the app icon even though you upload a 512x512 icon it's never seen at that resolution. On most devices it's seen much much smaller. I would make sure before uploading your icon you view it at 80x80 and make sure it still looks good. Most older devices will see your icon around this size.

- Submit your app to all the android app review sites. There are a bunch of them and most of them offer free versions. It may take a few weeks to get on the site

- Pick your 1 main keyword or phrase you want to target for your app and make sure you place it in your app title as well as in the app description.

- If you have a paid app and it's $0.99 raise the app to $1.99. Google released a good marketing video for the app store a few months back talking about how raising the price almost always brought in more downloads and revenue. They said people associate $0.99 apps to be cheap quality and would rather pay 1$ more for a higher quality app. They said not only that but you can drop the price by 1$ for a sale but if it's at $0.99 you can never drop the price

If you do some of these you should have a decent chance of making some decent money. If you do all of them you should have a really good chance. Keep in mind though that not every app makes it and sometimes you have to cut your losses with the app and create a new one.",,t5_2r26y,1369618152.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/1f3cma/i_have_12_million_downloads_here_are_some_tips/

Hi there!
For this first tutorial I think I will start off with a brief overview of 1. The different ways to develop for the Android system

So, they are the Android **SDK** and the Android **NDK**. SDK stands for *Software* Development Kit and NDK stands for *Native* Development Kit. The difference between the two is that the SDK is used to program Android applications in Java while using (mostly) Android specific packages, while the NDK is used to program directly for the phone's processor using native-code languages (C and C++). 

The SDK is what most applications are based on, which is best described as a translator between your code and the processor itself. Think of this this way: If you program using the NDK you are programming something that the processor can directly understand, while if you program using the SDK you are making something that only the Dalvik VM can understand and that in turn has to translate all your code into a language the processor can understand. It's as if you are programming in Dutch but the processor only speaks English.

The NDK is typically only used in CPU-intensive applications and the most common case for it is to create direct OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) code to display 3D models. You have OpenGL wrappers available to you in the Android SDK but these act slower than directly coding in the NDK due to having to be translated by the Dalvik VM. The NDK as I said previously is much harder to program for

Please keep in mind that you can not solely create an application using the NDK

Almost all these tutorials will focus on the SDK, please feel free to do so.

That was a lot to go through at once so if you don't understand some of it

 

Now

The site that has the last guide is the official Android developers website and it is amazing. Learn to love it.

One of the steps in that last guide shows you how to set up your ""Hello

    package com.android.helloandroid;
    
    import android.app.Activity;
    import android.os.Bundle;
    import android.widget.TextView;
    
    public class HelloAndroid extends Activity {
        /** Called when the activity is first created. */
        @Override
        public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
            TextView tv = new TextView(this);
            tv.setText(""Hello
            setContentView(tv);
        }
    }

I'm going to ignore the import lines because Eclipse will take care of those automatically if you hit Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+O.

Line 7: 
    public class HelloAndroid extends Activity {

tells the VM that you are creating a *class* called HelloAndroid and that it *extends* the class Activity. This means that you are creating an complicated object that has different methods and variables you are calling HelloAndroid and that is it a subsect of the bigger class Activity. Activity's lifecycle was demonstrated in the picture linked earlier.


Line 9:
    @Override
this tells the VM that you are about to create a method and that this method will *override* a parent method. In this case


Line 10:
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
I should've probably mixed this in with the last line. But then again, your other files can see it), *void* (as in, it doesn't return any value when it's done) method called **onCreate**. Your method is also receiving a *Bundle* of information when it opens. This will be empty right now but if you had another Activity in your program you could call it from this Activity and pass along a Bundle of data to it. 


Line 11:
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
Every time you override a method you have to first have to call the the super class. This tells the system that you are in the onCreate portion of your application. If you ever forget to do this the VM will be nice enough to output to the log ""missing super call"" and then crash your application.


Line 12:
    TextView tv = new TextView(this);
You are creating a [TextView](http://d.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html) object and you are calling it tv. The TextView is being created with *this* (your application) as it's parent.


Line 13:
    tv.setText(""Hello
If you clicked the link for the last line you saw all the different methods the TextView object has. In this line you are telling your TextView, Android"".


Line 14:
    setContentView(tv);
Perhaps this line would be easier to understand if you put an (unnecessary) *this* in front of it
    this.setContentView(tv);
In this line you are telling your Activity that the [view](http://d.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html) it displays to the user is your TextView called tv. TextView

 

Bam. Have you tried running this application yet? Either in the Virtual phone that ships with the Android SDK or your phone? (If you want to run this on your phone you'll need to enable ""USB Debugging"" in the settings of your phone.) Did you run it? Isn't it great? Note that if you click the ""home"" or ""back"" button on your phone

Aren't you proud of yourself? You should be. I feel like this is a huge first tutorial already so we won't discuss displaying your application via an XML Layout, World tutorial on the Android website to see how that's done. We'll go over it next time.

I then went on to discover that the cloned app even still has my /assets/NOTICE.txt (declaring the app copyright to me) and now has the other guy’s name appended to it. He also left in some of my strings and icons so it is clearly my work. His is even mirroring my changes when I push updates.

I migrated one of my applications from Eclipse to test the new IDE and couldn't find any major issues with it.  Since then I have migrated all of my applications and have yet to reopen Eclipse.  In my experience Android Studio starts slightly faster than Eclipse

Testing applications (clicking ""Run"") seems to take roughly the same amount of time.  Generating a signed .APK file takes half the time it did in Eclipse, the listener is generated with the onClick() function already in place.  In Eclipse, adding ""un-implemented methods"" required a second step.

I haven't explored the entire IDE yet, but the resource (.xml) files as well.  Android Studio creates a blank class for the activity and adds it to AndroidManifest.xml

At some point in time, since by default all major filemanager hide them from your view until requested, I can not live with this on my phones ""sd-card"".

I usually don't mess with your files in your apps data-dir, music, ...

Quite a lot of widely used apps don't even let me choose the folder used for backups or additionally downloaded data. This clutters the view

So please, that not all filesystems in use, espacially FAT-XX, support hidden folders, I could live with visible folders as long as they are organized.

So please,data}/yourapphere/stuff or at the very least, let me choose my own folder structure by giving me the chance to configure your storage paths.

- I did take some basic courses in Java back in college

- I'm fairly practiced in the ""copy and paste"" methodologies and Googling concepts for HTML

Even if you're not as ""tech savvy"" as I am

I'd actually say developing Android apps is MUCH easier than trying to develop straight Java.  I was thinking I'd have to learn Java before learning to develop for Android

Android has a bunch of build in libraries that essentially speed up the development process and ease the learning curve!

I think I'd get more discouraged if I tried to develop a GUI for Android strictly using Java commands.  Using the XML instead makes things a lot easier (for a newb like me).

Anyway, etc :) ), I see that it's more about how much time I actually want to invest in developing apps.

Hi there!

In the previous post we left off right as the Android [Hello World Tutorial](http://d.android.com/resources/tutorials/hello-world.html#upgrading) got to the layout portion. So

Your android application contains many folders (which you can see on the left-side of Eclipse). You have these folders: *src/*, values) reside. gen/ is a folder which you will never have to touch, it has one very magical file in it called R.java, R is a file that is automatically updated each time you put something in the res/ folder and it is the link between your code and the static files. For example, if you have a layout .xml file called ""main_layout.xml"" you can use it by using the variable R.layout.main_layout.

Now


    &lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
    &lt;TextView xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
        android:id=""@+id/textview""
        android:layout_width=""fill_parent""
        android:layout_height=""fill_parent""
        android:text=""@string/hello""/&gt;

So, this means that if this TextView is the only thing in an application it will automatically enlarge to fill the entire screen.

The id of this TextView is set as ""@+id/textview""

And finally

Here's the contents of strings.xml:

    &lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
    &lt;resources&gt;
        &lt;string name=""hello""&gt;Hello
        &lt;string name=""app_name""&gt;Hello
&lt;/resources&gt;

As you can see

We tell our application to use this view by replacing the last three lines in our onCreate function from the previous post to:

    setContentView(R.layout.main);

See how much easier that is than creating the layout programatically? 

We could have also had more than one view in our defined layout. To do this


We'll discuss that task later on next week

First of all, adding a menu to your application is as simple as overriding two functions. First of all:

    @Override
    public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
        super.onCreateOptionsMenu(menu);
        menu.add(0, ""Dark Theme"");
        
        return true;
    }


We are overriding a function of the class Activity called onCreateOptionsMenu and what this function receives is a [Menu](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Menu.html) creatively called menu.

In our override we use the function menu.add() to add an item to the menu. menu.add() has four arguments. The first (in this case 0) is the group to which we want this item to exist in


So far so good


The second function we need to override goes:

    @Override
    public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
        if(item.getItemId() == UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER) {
            // Do something.
        }
    }

The previous function was to add items to a menu before it gets displayed to the user

Try to think of something to do with this button. The easiest thing to do in my opinion is to use the [Log](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Log.html) class to send something out to logcat. This is done by:

    Log.i(""myTag""

Which can then be seen by either going to the Debugging perspective (Window --&gt; Open Perspective --&gt; Debug) and then look through the logcat tab. You can also do this by opening up a command line and typing ""adb logcat"". 

If you're a wild and crazy guy you could also consider defining the TextView used outside of your functions and using this menuitem to change it's text. You can get a handle on the TextView by adding this line to after your *setContentView()* function in onCreate:

    myTextView = (TextView)findViewById(R.id.textviewId);

Of course



I was originally going to also discuss listviews in this tutorial but I feel like we just covered a lot and I'll leave listviews for a later tutorial.

I posted it on [Github](https://github.com/ragunathjawahar/android-saripaar) (Yeah

**Traditional - Required Field**

    String username = userNameEditText.getText().toString();
    int usernameLength = username.length();
    if (usernameLength == 0) {
            // Notify the user that username is required.
    } else if (usernameLength &lt; 3) {
           // Notify the user that username is too short.

**Saripaar - Required Field**

    @Required(order = 1
    @TextRule(order = 2
    private EditText usernameEditText;


**Saripaar - Email (Optional or Valid)**

    @Email(order = 1
    private EditText emailEditText;


**Saripaar - Email (Required and Valid)**

    @Required(order = 1
    @Email(order = 1
    private EditText emailEditText;


This is how concise your code could get when you use Saripaar and these examples just showcase the tip of the iceberg.

You can validate IP addresses, etc., Some of the salient features that improve productivity when you use [Android Saripaar](https://github.com/ragunathjawahar/android-saripaar) are,

    • Annotation support
    • Custom Rules
    • Complex Rules (And, Composite Or, etc.,)
    • Asynchronous validation (You don't have to worry about threading and AsyncTasks.
    • Rule only validation (If you are validating against a database or a network connection.


We use this extensively for our projects at [Mobs and Geeks](http://mobsandgeeks.com) and have achieved significant productivity in most of the projects.

[Saripaar](https://github.com/ragunathjawahar/android-saripaar) does a remarkable job of offloading the validation logic from your business logic thereby allowing to save a lot of time testing your code.

Advantages:

* All beta testers receive beta versions as **automatic upgrades**.

* _When_ the beta crashes

Disadvantages.

* Like normal updates

Here's how you create a beta

1. You need to create a Google group or Google+ community **with your developer account** (make sure you're logged into the same gmail). I also have a Google+ Page

2. In the play store, not in production. You can at any time move an apk from being beta to production, back again, or remove it entirely.

3. In the beta tab
At the bottom you find a special link that all your beta testers have to click. Publish this in you community or group.

The trick with the last link is that it only works if the user is already a member of you community/group. So tell them to join before clicking on it. It will lead them to a page with a warning and a big ""Become a beta tester"" button. Once they've joined

So for example (**I am not fishing for testers**

Anyway

I started work on this game (Capricious Circuitry) a couple of months ago as a hobby, of which I chose the one I thought would be easiest to make. Funny how the one I thought would be ‘easy’ was anything but.

The idea behind the game is you’ve got a bunch of power sources (which have a little sinusoidal curve on them – I think I was electricity in physics when I made that sprite), just looking at a video if it now, it’s eerily similar, more so than I thought). If that doesn’t help, [here’s a youtube video of a development version which should illustrate the idea well enough](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39E09cRZU8M) (there’s also a bunch of other videos showing the development history of the app).

**What went wrong:**

1. The framework I created for dealing with different types of tiles was perhaps a bit too general and over-engineered. I created it with much more in mind than I actually used – I expected to include about 5 or 10 types of tiles, wire tiles, and teleporter tiles. 

2. I found the Android layout system particularly arcane – I think I spent a large swath of time there trying to get it to do what I wanted. I think some of the problems stemmed from me not using any hardcoded widths or heights – only using fill_parent and wrap_content (which, but I think creating several layouts for small, medium and large screens with hardcoded dp values might be preferable to the amount of time I spent fiddling around without using them. But then you also have the problem of, if you hardcode, say, a button to be 100 dp wide, even on the exact same device, the translated text might overflow that 100 dp button. Getting stuff to be laid out correctly was probably my most frustrating experience with Android development. 

3. Since I’m only a programmer, because it’s something that I can sort of do (even though it’s still shit). However, I ran into a problem here with respect to how to scale it. My main game screen displays an NxN grid of tiles. This is scaled to be as large as it can.  Let’s assume I’m using GL_NEAREST scaling (that is, there is no averaging of pixel values – it will still look ‘pixelly’ and not blurred when scaled). The problem presents itself when I scale the board to a non-integer multiple. Straight lines will sometimes be thinner than other straight lines which should be the same. Other graphical fuck ups also appear, along the lines of what has already been mentioned. Now, I could only scale to an integer multiple, but that means the game view I present could be excessively small, I decided to bite the bullet and use GL_LINEAR scaling (on pixel art... the horror). I’d probably solve this by not using pixel art

4. Tax stuff. Not much to say here. I wtf’d at what I was meant to put for what kind of tax I’m meant to charge on my donate version (so I just put ‘not charging any’). I live in Australia

5. Switching between building the free version and the donate version. This is more of an annoyance than anything. I couldn’t find a good way to build both the donate version and the free version – that is, one for donate and one for free, I couldn’t figure out a good way to sync changes across them. In future, I’ll probably just write a script to this shit for me.

**What went right:**
First app

1. The level creation process. It’s actually really easy to create levels the way I did it. You create a solved level in a map editor (specifically a program called Tiled). Then it goes through a bunch of scripts which convert the .tmx file produced by Tiled into a format my app understands. Then, reads in the solved level, and then scrambles it. Although, I did this in a pretty retarded way, since I couldn’t be bothered thinking. Essentially, I scrambled the solved board by swapping a random tile and not revisiting any previous states for about 1000 iterations. Then I used a stupid bruteforce to solve it (was just a BFS – I thought about it for about 10 minutes, thought if I’d made the specification for what tiles are allowed less general, the harder it is – not necessarily true). 


2. It got finished. Possibly the best thing that went right. It actually got done. Pretty much my first ‘non trivial’ (well

3. Error reporting. Possibly the most useful last minute addition I thought of. Looking back, very easy to set up and get working). It sends me a full stacktrace a bunch of extra information, and some custom information I added, every time my app crashes. In the first day, I was able to fix 2 bugs just from the information gleaned from these error reports.

**The release:**
More nerve-wracking than I thought it would be. A few minutes after I uploaded, non market versions, had run in landscape. Weird, I thought. But it’s quite difficult to debug something that weird, especially with no way to reproduce it, so I just decided to allow the app to go both ways (lol), that is

The next bug after that was users clicking ‘next’ after completing the last level. A surprising amount of reports came in from ACRA about this. I guess it’s because I said that the game was hard (truly, well, let’s try the hardest level (which wasn’t actually the hardest. Quite easy actually. Again, problems with my heuristic of: the more moves it takes to solve, the harder it is), and after they completed it, they decided to press next. BAM. Exception. Fuck. Patched that.

Next bug took a while to present itself (in relative terms. More like a day, rather than the GC being retarded). I had a bunch of bitmaps I was storing. Which I thought would get collected when I called Activity.finish() on my game activity. Apparently not. Anyway, I just called Bitmap.recycle() on them and then set the references to them to null. Furthermore, I set it so no activity would be recreated when the screen orientation was changed, so if there were still leaks, there would now be less of them. This mitigated the problem.

I spent many months learning and developing a Tower defense game. Although I finished pretty much all of the code and the game itself

Also note, this is basically a random stopping point from when I got a little burned out and just ran out of motivation.. I wish I was gifted in art like some of you =)

Note not all the art is public domain, which has a different license you can find here: andengine.org

Github link:
https://github.com/cstockton/epiris-td-example

Here is a doc I made so you can get a idea of some of the features:

--------------------------------

EpirisTD (BETA) is a innovative and new tower defense game. Currently 6 open maps allow building complicated mazes on THE largest maps available on the marketplace (2048x2048) pixels! You may build 50 Towers which include 5 tiers of upgrades, range, speed, affects, purity and finally access to each towers ULTIMATE.

Towers offer the most unique attacks on the marketplace, who have unique abilities themselves, including removing your stuns and snares, healing eachother and offering boosts of speed or teleportation.

Achievements can be unlocked to earn you game points which can be redeemed to upgrade your towers and give special bonuses and affects. Fast forward and level skipping both available

Currently a survival game mode that never ends is the only game mode available

**Andlytics**
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.andlyticsproject&amp;hl=en

Free app for keeping track of your downloads/reviews/comments on the Play Store. Get notified as soon as somebody leaves a review/comment - you can also reply to reviews straight from this app as they come in.


**Appmonger**
http://rectangularsoftware.com/appmonger/

Get notified of every new purchase and in-app purchase.
Allows you to group purchases by product id if you have multiple ones.
Lots of nice graphs for tracking your revenue before &amp; after Google fees.
Also has a nice widget that allows you to quickly view how much you've made in total/this month/last month etc. Compatible with old Google Checkout and the newer Google Wallet that most people have been migrated to. Far nicer than trying to track revenue via the Developer Console.


**FreshDesk**
http://freshdesk.com/helpdesk-tour/

After a while when your downloads rise and support emails start coming in


**Google Analytics**
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.giant&amp;hl=en

Probably an obvious one


**QuickFile**
http://quickfile.co.uk

For any devs in the UK


**Trello**
https://trello.com/b/UYNj6yTj/juicessh-roadmap

We use trello to publish an informal roadmap and keep our customers up to date with what we're working on. It also allows our customers to set the priority of what do by voting on items. It also means that when we get repeat emails for feature requests we can point them in the direction of the roadmap and show that it's already on our list.


What other tools do you guys use and can recommend?

About me:

* I’m a web and graphic designer since 10 yrs, UI requirements etc.
* I’m an avid Android user
* I live and work in Europe

What I can do:

* App design, logo design, anything design related in general

What I’m looking for:

* I’m mostly looking for individuals, and because of that the development process is slow
* New apps or interface revamps
* Paid and free softwares are both welcome
* I’m mostly looking for app interface design works
* I’m not just into graphics
* I’m not able to design complex game graphics. I just feel that I don’t have the time and resources to do something like that. Small casual games might be okay though.

What I need in return:

* All the design work is free of charge. I don’t care if you make a fortune with your app
* You don’t have to credit me at all
* I will include these work in my portfolio.

&gt;Dear Sir/Madam

&gt;I am able to provide 5 star ratings in Google Play:

&gt;- Each app will be installed and not uninstalled for at least 1 month to not cause bad rankings in Google Play
&gt;- Paid apps are also not a problem (price of the app will be added to the normal price) 
&gt;- There is no minimum order size
&gt;- It’s possible to provide 5 star ratings + positive comment
&gt;- iOS ratings also available - Only pay after you are 100% satisfied

&gt;Price per 5 star rating = $2
&gt;Price per 5 star rating + positive comment provided by yourself = $2

&gt;Order more than 100 ratings and get 500 Google Plus +1's for free!

&gt;Good ratings will generate more downloads because the app will be listed higher in the Google Play search results.

&gt;Best regards

1) How hard is it? How much time and effort should one invest to create such an income stream? Does this sound a reasonable goal to you?

2) Is developing and selling an app can create long term income

Includes pre-made effects such as Bloom

* basic filter operators are included, threshold
* multi-pass filters makes use of one or more basic filters (eg. Blur uses convolve2d filters)
* effects can then use multiple type of filters to create a new effect (eg. Bloom uses Blur+Threshold+Combine)

Hopefully this library will make it simpler to add effects to your games and will leave you with more time to invest in your own creations instead!

Forks, critiques, suggestions and especially new effects are encouraged :)

It's best if your working image is already square so that it doesn't turn out warped.

I know there's tools out there that do the same thing and more but I figured I'd give a go at it, though I'll probably prefer the Python API in the future.

I'm definitely going to be using this script; I figured I'd share it. I might work on expanding it in the future.

Video of glitch: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCcyP--AMWk&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player)

Recently a user reported this bug to me that they found with their 4.2 device. Without getting into too much detail about my app

**So what is the glitch? Here's a quick rundown of it all:**

* User uses an app that has the ability to set alarm
* App sets alarm using 4.2 stock alarm app
* 4.2 alarm app appears. Alarm appears to be set with toast notification showing and the alarm app showing to be on
* BUT there is no alarm icon in the top right next to he time/WiFi/data icons
* Alarm never goes off because even though alarm may seem like it has been set

**How do you (as a user) fix this glitch?**

* Once an alarm has been set by an app, changing the label, etc) or changing anything in one of the other alarms

**How do you (as a dev) fix this glitch?**

* Somehow let your users be aware of the glitch
* A more practical fix would be when creating your intent

As you can see this is a very serious issue since setting an alarm usually means that you want to be reminded of something important. I apologize if my app caused any of you to wake up late due to this glitch.

1374853976.0,1j3prz,What is your preferred development/design process?,Syia,25,2,3,"What is your work development process like from the initial design to the final release of your product?

I have designed a few applications for school, but I consider myself still very inexperienced in large-scale, professional software engineering. I am wondering how to improve my development methodologies to ensure well-written, modular, extensible code and creating an easily maintainable res/ setup. Typically, for work we meet in a smaller group with a ""back-end"" engineer (the guy writing our REST services and so forth), a graphics artist/designer

After I setup a new project with Git and known maven dependencies, padding, company color schema, ...) and theme boilerplate code (since I don't have colorized, high-fidelity mockups at this point) to view my work. Then, I update the Manifest, including all known activities in the mockups. Finally

The issue I run into a lot is that, if I refactor immediately after I find myself repeating myself.

Eventually, I'll redefine the layout roughly (but not pixel-perfect at this point). When it comes time to review progress (especially with my boss), it seems easier to sell a ""prettier,"" but an incomplete app. I worry that the time I spend here, can sometimes be a huge waste of time if we decide to change the core design of the app around that activity. 

As more and more of these features get thrown in, we review again. If there are substantial changes to make (something just doesn't seem to work right/nicely) then the previous process repeats itself. 

Finally, but also by coworkers testing each other's work) there's one ""final"" review. 

After this is still unfamiliar to me. I don't publish work to the playstore because it's intended to be distributed privately (school, I make sure proguard is configured correctly and release the signed apk internally via e-mail. 

I feel that our design process is rough around the edges. Particularly

* How/When/Who to handle testing?
* Should the app be polished as I go along
* At what points do you decide to handle code review?
* Do you handle formal documentation along the way

I'm scared and very excited right now. My baby or, unfortunately, might hurt market ratings, but I need to get more feedback from more users. I was sending it out to my friends, but usually only 2 from 20 would report something useful back.

So here it is: https://market.android.com/details?id=com.snottyapps.pigrun

Disclaimer: I'm just an amateur-ish programmer and even worse designer/illustrator

I'm using simple SurfaceView approach

Also, when it changes its adview (no ad rotation, just same ad changing text). Is it possible to do something here?

---

1_1 Update:

* fixed an issue which caused game to restart if keyboard state changed
* fixed (I think) ""music-out-of-nowhere"" bug
* fixed a landing glitch which enabled piglet to do a triple/quadruple jumps

* added an exit button

* changed the flow of jump (is it better now?)
* decreased speed boost and made it shorter

---

1_3 Update:

* fixed a bug where pig could ""land to deep underground""

* fixed a bug where pig could jump ""through"" obstacles

* changed action handling. It may fix ""Galaxy Nexus"" issues or it may ruin everything for some other device

* playable area now expands to fill larger screens (tck tck Galaxy Nexus)

* added help (kind of)

* redrawn ground (will probably redraw it again in future)

* added some minor visual improvements

---

1_4 Update

* added

* fixed a little glitch in ground/grass animations

* optimized ground/grass drawing 

* added: settings section

* added: option to switch touchable areas

* added: options to toggle some drawable objects (might improve performance in slower devices)

* styled buttons a bit

* can't remember more

Admob has been pretty good to me. The per-click revenue might not be the highest, it will either show a new ad, or if an ad has been up for 30 seconds, I hide it and make sure they get at least 30 seconds of ad-free time. This keeps ads out of the users face for 50% of the time, and also gives them a taste of what the app is like without ads if they decide to spring for the pro version.

The idea is that you can line up before and after photos (for when you cut your hair, and take the second picture. Various output options are given after you take the second picture.

The app has been in the market for quite long now

Would you like to help me by testing the app and by giving me tips on how to improve it?

Almost all of the crashes were out of memory errors

* Avoid ever having full large bitmaps in memory. Making your Http client stream straight to disk would be best. You can also write the byte array to disk as fast as possible once it downloads.

* Scale your images from disk by using the BitmapFactory.Options parameter inSampleSize. Google provides a handy method  that can calculate a recommended inSampleSize for your sizing needs in the [documentation](http://developer.android.com/training/displaying-bitmaps/load-bitmap.html#load-bitmap). If you use this method

* While on the topic of BitmapFactory.Options
    
        BitmapFactory.Options options = new BitmapFactory.Options();
        options.inJustDecodeBounds = true; // only calculate the size of the image
        BitmapFactory.decodeFile(bitmapFile
                
        options.inJustDecodeBounds = false;
        options.inSampleSize = calculateInSampleSize(options
        options.inPurgeable = true;
        options.inInputShareable = true;

        Bitmap scaledBitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(bitmapFile

* Use an LruCache for your in-memory bitmap cache. Do not make the mistake of limiting your cache by the number of bitmaps in the cache. Override the sizeOf() method of LruCache and return your bitmaps byte size. 

        // for older clients    
        int byteSize = bitmap.getRowBytes() * bitmap.getHeight();
        
        // api level 12+
        int byteSize = bitmap.getByteCount();

* I encountered one pitfall while populating my list view asynchronously with my brand new image cache. Scrolling was smooth and image loading performant

* Use a ThreadPoolExecutor and Runnables to limit how many threads you are using at a time. On my medium-larger sized app with a lot of photo downloads, and 2 threads for image processing and fetching from disk. Too many threads slows scrolling to a halt. This also prevents you from accruing a massive amount of in-memory byte[] arrays from downloading 100 images at the same time.

* **Always** perform disk operations asynchronously.


Would love to see more tips and suggestions from other devs.

I've just developed my first app and I'm having a hard time getting the word out. I'm trying to get it reviewed but haven't had any success with that yet. But let me tell you WHY i developed it.

I was working on a freelance project for a client that I've worked with for years now, ""Why not just turn your phone to silent? Problem solved!"" Yes and no. You see, my Mother is getting up there in age and last year she fell down and broke her leg all the way through the tibia and fibula. She was bed ridden for nearly a year and still has a lot of screws in her leg. (God bless her). So you see, I never want to turn my phone to silent because if I get a call anytime day or night I want to get the call and be there. However, I did eventually turn my phone to silent for a few nights to finish up the project and yes, my mother is doing fine even though I turned it to silent. The project wrapped up, got launched

Because of this

https://market.android.com/details?id=com.musselwhizzle.dnd.pro
and 
https://market.android.com/details?id=com.musselwhizzle.dnd.trial

So now that I have it released, or even businessmen in meeting but still need to get that important call. But alas, it hasn't been reviewed yet. Do I need to pay for reviews? Some places like AndroidPit charge for reviews. Is this legit? There are a lot of other places like that charge. My first instinct is that I shouldn't be paying for a product review. 

So what do you guys think? How can I get the word out better? Is there any tricks to getting it reviewed? Should I pay to have it reviewed? If you happen to download the app

Thanks gang. I appreciate you taking the time to read.

What can I do to troubleshoot this issue? Some things I've tried so far include - uninstalling the app from my phone/emulator and doing a fresh install. Cleaned my project and all libraries it uses. Using the newest support library. I've updated all of the libraries. I've double, n-le checked the build path. I installed the Android Studio (grasphing at straws, thinking surely, this must be Eclipses fault) and tried to execute it from there and still, my app fails.

I removed any mention of Acra from my app, the first piece of *my* code that my app tries to execute, it fails.

In certain cases we were inserting ~10

Previously we were using     

    SQLiteDatabase.execSQL(String)

That too within a loop.

Using this method on the database meant that the insert process for ~10

Today we changed the method to this

    SQLiteDatabase sqliteDatabase = db.getWritableDatabase();
    
    sqliteDatabase.beginTransaction(); //Statement 1
    
    String sql = ""INSERT INTO "" +""Table_Name(nameOfColumn

    sqliteDatabase.setTransactionSuccessful();    
    sqliteDatabase.endTransaction(); 

The time for the insertion of 10

It was astonishing. Mind you that we didn't know what this method did, turned up a result that contained this code &amp; my teammate copy/pasted it. 

I looked into these methods

First I think that the ""magic"" lies in Statement 1

Which in the case of using the `execSQL()` method in a loop means that the lock is gained and released each iteration of the loop. Whereas in the former case the lock is gained and released only once. This would defnitely save time. 

Second I think that in Statement 2, the part where the values being inserted are changing is still very vague to me, I have a hunch that the values keep changing behind the scenes within the variable stack.

I could most definitely be utterly wrong about all this. That exactly is what the point of my post is. 

I want to know if I have understood this correctly

The other frameworks like Sencha and DHTMLX do feel very responsive in the test applications.  The problem? Sencha Touch 2 has piss poor support for Windows dev and no support for Linux dev.  It is also another 'iPhone First' design like jQuery Mobile.  DHTMLX is one of the most native feeling ones out there, it is based off of jQuery, so it's somewhat decent to learn.  It has a very fast and smooth feel, but its still too new with some serious *small* but major bugs.

So what do you all prefer?  I know this has been asked, because there are a growing number of very clean and native-feeling HTML5 apps coming out all the time.  I personally feel as these libraries and methods get better, we can get a true cross platform development going that isn't subjected to waiting months on end between an iPhone -&gt; Android release (and even our friends in Windows Phone).

The company in question is offering me $0.25 per install which means they'd pay me around $3k. I think I can negotiate that number up a bit too.

Hi all..
I'm a hobbyist Android developer and I'm stumped as to what triggers the HTC One X(and I assume the other ""One"" phones) to display it's soft menu button on the screen.

Common sense tells me that it should display for apps that aren't optimized for ICS

On the 4.0.x emulator

On my physical device, and the overflow is not displayed since it is activated by the legacy capacitive menu button.

Those two cases seem correct. I've also implemented Google's compatibility libraries to make everything play nicely on pre ICS devices as well.

However
Looked at the HTC dev site to see if there was something specific I needed to know, even though my login/password work properly on their website. ..not that I'm optimistic about it holding the answer to this problem)

So I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has had a similiar experience trying to adapt to the One X.. and if so

Thanks!

How should I approach them with this?  Their current app in the market has 3 out of 5 stars and has low functionality and is just very amateur overall.  On their blog, they seem like a very progressive, forward-thinking, innovative company.  They've held YouTube contests for publicity, for example.

This app has a lot of income potential, which would drastically augment their income level for various demographic reasons.  Most people would not pay for an app like this, so they are missing out on 3/4 of their market.

I have implemented many of the feature requests in their low rating comments.  In an ideal world, but they would miss out literally on 7 figures a year, instead of now where they are currently making a thousand dollars a month at best.  (This app is in a niche that supports a yearly subscription-based payed version on the freemium model).
