1366856741.0,1d20w6,AoE2 Newbie Guide: Things I Wish I Knew Earlier,madlordofmilk,206,30,71,"As a fellow newbie

The most useful guide for me thus far was this video: [Age of Empires 2 The Conquerors: How To Rush Tutorial/Rush Defense by Ilumiknight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjj8qHKcBcQ).
It teaches a number of useful things:

* How to get your economy going quickly. **Your town center should never be idle.**
* Building your base in a defensive way
* How to properly handle a rush
* A number of different feudal age strategies
* And more!

Learning how to handle the early game well is a huge part of playing competitively. Having some sort of build order (a set plan on how you'll build up your economy and where you'll put your first villagers in the dark age) can help a lot. Knowing how to win in the late game is only useful if you can actually get there.

Some general advice, but it can help get you off on the right foot:

**General:**

* Learn your hotkeys! One of the first things you should do in a game is hit HCCCC (selects your town center and queues 4 villagers). If you're having trouble with them
* Use control groups. Hit ctrl+(number) to set a group, but that also focuses the camera on it. You can also quickly tap the number twice to center the camera on the control group.
* You can queue actions by shift-clicking. To build multiple buildings, then do a *final* right click without shift (this is different from other RTSes).
* When playing random map games

**Economy:**

* **Make sure your town center is never idle!** Always be building villagers or researching something. This is a good approach to make sure your economy builds fast enough. Generally, with military units for the rest. Adjust this to different situations, but particularly at lower levels of skill, having a better economy makes a *massive* difference.

* At the start of a game, where your large forests are, where your berries are, etc.
* Start the game by getting food from sheep and pumping out villagers. When you're about to run out of sheep (you have 8), Loom helps with scout harassment. If your game is lagging hard when you hunt boar, [follow this advice](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGZ1NY74g4I) to keep your villager alive.
* You want to assign your first 6 villagers to sheep (5 for Britons due to their 20% sheep gathering bonus)
* Don't be afraid to move around your villagers. If you have a ton of wood but not enough food
* Because it's not intuitive: If you have a bunch of villagers selected and right-click on one farm
* Build at LEAST 1 extra town center - preferably 2-3 more - as soon as you reach Castle Age. It takes a long time to make all the villagers (as well as research the gathering bonus techs!) you're going to need so these extra TCs are essential to getting a great economy up and running quickly.
* Practice getting to Feudal Age quickly. Need a go-to ""default"" Dark Age build? [Check out this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtukDHXy9GU). Knowing the early game well makes a huge difference in lower-level games
* When one or a group of vils build a farm, mill they automatically deposit whatever resource they're carrying. This only applies to *builders*, not to workers sent to other resource nodes. When a villager goes to a different resource, anything they have not deposited gets lost (this includes different sources of food!).

**Military/Defense**

* Learn what units counter what. Also pay attention to how much units cost: Knights are awesome and super strong in Castle Age, they didn't cost any gold whereas your opponent's archers did.
* Build your base defensively. Use your buildings as walls and make paths that the enemies have to come through to get in. This will help a lot in holding off early attacks as players attacking early aren't trying to kill you
* Houses can make effective walls early game without costing stone. Plus
* Siege is actually super important in this game. In games like Warcraft III
* Related to the above: learn to love trebuchets. They deal massive damage and will outrange towers and castles. They're also expensive and weak
* Don't forget to learn blacksmith upgrades. They're huge. As a general rule, I tend to get defense first
* Don't neglect your economy! Multitasking between economy management and military gets easier with time.
* Town Centers are actually a great defense. They're really
* When garrisoning villagers (eg in the town center while getting rushed)
* Military units can be garrisoned in the building they're made in. When building them, though, they can't come out. If you're getting attacked and have no army, this is super useful as it lets you build up a small force and then release them rather then sending units one at a time to die to an army.
* Build multiple copies of the same military building

**How to Keep Improving**

* Play! You can learn a lot by studying
* At first
* Record your games! Watch them later and scrutinize where you made mistakes
* Watch recorded games of other players, so don't copy them exactly. Watch what they're doing and try to reason why they make the decisions they do.

**Useful Links**

* [BBQTurkman's Youtube Tutorials](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL891DE10D2EFEA2E6) can help get you off to the right start
* [ZeroEmpire's Youtube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/ZeroEmpires) has a lot of awesome videos of AoE2 matches filled with commentary. [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OC5jndPODU) was one of my favorites (for entertainment
* [AoCZone](http://aoczone.net/) is a pretty solid forum community. The site also has a *ton* of replays available for download.

Hopefully that helps!

Also, but I'm working on getting better!

**tl;dr** If you walk away with nothing else
It makes all the difference in the world when you're starting out.

I'm not going over any build orders or strategies. You can find plenty of recordings or videos online.

**General Problems**

* Always be making villagers (generally at least 100 villagers but it depends on pop cap, etc.).
* Villagers should never idle.
* Do everything with a sense of urgency
* Don't needlessly waste units
* Always be scouting.

**Really Noob Mistakes**

* DO NOT RING YOUR BELL. This halts your entire economy
* Use your boars - every map has at least 2 boars near your TC. Reasearch loom and send a villager out to shoot the boar TWICE (if you shoot it once it will not chase) and then run back to your TC where you should have villagers ready to kill the boar.
* Most maps have at least 8 sheep/turkey near your TC. Find them and put (at least) your first 6 villagers on them.
* Research loom at some point.

**Noob Mistakes**

* Don't put all of your first farms around the mill. Your first few farms should be around your TC. This allows you to quickly garrison inside your TC for protection much quicker than if they were at the mill. You can eventually put farms around the mill once it is safe.
* You don't always need to make militia in the Dark/Feudal Age
* When you hit Castle Age
* If you are on a water map then you generally want to build a dock at some point in the Dark ages.
* If you are booming^1 then wall appropriately.
* Use your blacksmith!
* Upgrade your lumberjacks speed as soon as you reach the next age. You should get the farm and mining upgrades at some point as well but not necessarily right away.

**Above Noob Mistakes**

* Economies win games
* Don't let villagers needlessly die if you are being raided. Put defenses (i.e. castles
* Don't let resources stockpile
* Don't let your army get out of position
* If you're in a team game and you beat an opponent then quickly move on to the next or help your teammates. You do not need to destroy every building and unit of someone who has quit.
* Lose to someone better than you? Watch the recording and see why they are better.

I wrote this pretty quickly and may add to it later. If you have any rebuttals for any of these points then I'd be glad to hear them.

Notes

^1 An economic boom (referred to as ""booming"") is when you are completely dedicating your effort to your economy. Your goal is to constantly pump out villagers as quickly as possible and then advance to Imperial Age. This is usually done by getting to Castle quickly and building lots of TCs.",self,t5_2sg7u,1365795543.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1c7zwe/how_to_not_suck_at_aoe2/

So the game's a 1v1v1 on some desert map (maybe Arabia? It was random), we're all doin well off the start, chatting and bemoaning our common lack of sheep. Castle age comes, they've both walled themselves in (green almost 2/3 of the map I'd find out at the end). Little fights here and there, nothing major. Heading to the Imperial age, I get ganged up on once, green gets ganged up on a few times

So it becomes rather clear we've got ourselves a stalemate. I decide to pool my remaining resources and invest half my villagers and the requisite 1k wood gold and stone for a wonder (victory was standard). The wonder finishes without much hitch - I assumed they were massing their armies no doubt. About 20 'years' after I finish it, who had been surprisingly quiet. He hadn't attacked me yet this game, but had fended off both my previous pretty substantial attacks rather well. 

So it gets to about 50 years left, he'd built a forward castle complete with protecting bombard towers, so my troops couldn't wade too far out. I'm still fighting him off though, all the way down to 10 years. At this point I've just spamming troops towards the wonder, but his men have begun to outnumber mine. As the time ticks under 10 years, he says fuck it and goes for the wonder with everything he's got - camels, swordsmen, bombard cannons. We all begin our gg's with about 5 years left when we notice his cannons are actually doing a number on the wonder. The smile on my face fades away slowly as I realize he's got a legitimate shot at actually finishing my wonder and subsequently decking me.

2 years hits and the wonders below half hp and dropping fast. My guys can't get to the cannons fast enough and I'm swearing at my computer screen so loud and fast I swear I made up a few new words. As the timer hits 0

AoK was released at a time when many users did not have 32-bit color graphics hardware. Except for a few earlier adopters with 3D graphics cards, developers at the time had to resort to special tricks involving look up tables, special palettes, and hand optimized assembly routines. Furthermore, because hardware could only use one palette at a time, special colors had to be reserved for drawing Windows' GUI elements.

http://i.imgur.com/5nDo1W0.jpg

*Early terrain rendering prototype showing 3D mesh wireframe.*

Switching to 32-bit graphics was complicated by the fact that the original art assets to the game had been lost to time. We decided that the best way to update the render was to replace parts of it, and lighting, while still using the original system for rendering units, buildings, and trees.
Another goal with the update was to improve the compatibility with modern operating systems and hardware. AoK utilized technology called DirectDraw to perform 2D graphics on Windows. DirectDraw has been deprecated since 2000

Currently from what I have gathered from Steam Chat that the AOE II HD Dev team is currently working on is as follows:

* Priority is on issues affecting game performance
* ~~Windows XP
* Speed
* **FPS**
* Crash in quick search
* Lag Issues 

Other related issues they are looking into are as follows:

* Workshop Content disapeering after playing one time
* Achievements not unlocking
* Improvements to the Lobby/Matchmaking
* Out of Sync errors
* ~~Age of Empires 2 HD ""Unable to initialize graphics system. Device may not meet minimum specs. Subcode=3""~~ This error seems to be caused by your hardware not supporting the shader model needed. Check Below.

They do not have an eta on when these fixes may be coming. Currently

**Below this point there are some fixes for the more common problems:**

If you are having problems even starting the game

* White screen will usually indicate that your GPU is only DX 9.0b compliant (If you have this error try

* ""Could not initialize graphics system. Make sure that your video card and driver are compatible with DirectDraw."" This error seems to occur if you on Windows XP SP2

(Unconfirmed) Possible fix for when you launch the game and then it quickly exits (Launcher doesn't appear):

* Go into AoE2HD's folder
* Delete launcher.exe (back it up somewhere just in case) and rename AoK HD.exe ""launcher.exe"" instead.
* That makes it so the game loads without the launcher

In Game Menu is blank: Try disabling scaling on high DPI settings (please confirm below if it worked)

* Start Menu &gt; Computer &gt; Steam &gt; Steamapps &gt; Common &gt; Age2HD &gt; Right Click AoK HD &gt; Properties &gt; Compatibility &gt; Check ""Disable display scaling on high DPI settings &gt; Apply

Fix for Crash before loading screen: (This may or may not work

* Start singleplayer game
* Disable the statistics with the Button above the minimap (Shortcut: F4)
* Quit the game completly!
* Start the game again
* Join a multiplayergame
* Don't turn statistics on during the game

Launcher doesn't look right

* This is because you have your DPI set incorrectly: 
* Right click on the Desktop
* Click Screen resolution
* Click the link ""Make text larger or smaller""
* Select either 100% (recommended!) or 150%
* Click Apply

Mouse does not stay confined to your screen (This is caused by having multiple monitors). Fix below

* Simply disable one of the monitors
* Right click on desktop and select screen resolution
* Next to multiple displays

Hotkey Fix: (**Confrimed**) Fix below (If you edit your hotkeys you'll need to move the .hki file again)

* When starting a multiplayer game

**This may fix some of the above issues.**

* Update your game by verifying the integrity of game cache by right clicking on the AOE II HD and selecting properties

**Multiplayer**

* Until everyone updates their game files during multiplayer

How to play on a different region:

* In steam

Comment from JesseBright

* I also apologize for being unable to provide official details on the future of AOE II:HD. I am an engineer and I will never be cleared to speculate about upcoming patches or release dates or anything like that. If this were one of our self published titles, but because this is a Microsoft title it would be extremely inappropriate for me to leak information about what may be coming in the future. All I can say is that the work this community has been doing is easily worth $100k in private testing and that I read this subreddit multiple times a day.

Currently from what I have gathered from Steam Chat that the AOE II HD Dev team is currently working on is as follows:

* Priority is on issues affecting game performance
* ~~Windows XP
* Speed
* **FPS**
* Crash in quick search
* Lag Issues 

Other related issues they are looking into are as follows:

* Workshop Content disapeering after playing one time
* Achievements not unlocking
* Improvements to the Lobby/Matchmaking
* Out of Sync errors
* ~~Age of Empires 2 HD ""Unable to initialize graphics system. Device may not meet minimum specs. Subcode=3""~~ This error seems to be caused by your hardware not supporting the shader model needed. Check Below.

They do not have an eta on when these fixes may be coming. Currently

**Below this point there are some fixes for the more common problems:**

If you are having problems even starting the game

* White screen will usually indicate that your GPU is only DX 9.0b compliant (If you have this error try

* ""Could not initialize graphics system. Make sure that your video card and driver are compatible with DirectDraw."" This error seems to occur if you on Windows XP SP2

(Unconfirmed) Possible fix for when you launch the game and then it quickly exits (Launcher doesn't appear):

* Go into AoE2HD's folder
* Delete launcher.exe (back it up somewhere just in case) and rename AoK HD.exe ""launcher.exe"" instead.
* That makes it so the game loads without the launcher

In Game Menu is blank: Try disabling scaling on high DPI settings (please confirm below if it worked)

* Start Menu &gt; Computer &gt; Steam &gt; Steamapps &gt; Common &gt; Age2HD &gt; Right Click AoK HD &gt; Properties &gt; Compatibility &gt; Check ""Disable display scaling on high DPI settings &gt; Apply

Fix for Crash before loading screen: (This may or may not work

* Start singleplayer game
* Disable the statistics with the Button above the minimap (Shortcut: F4)
* Quit the game completly!
* Start the game again
* Join a multiplayergame

Comment from JesseBright

* I also apologize for being unable to provide official details on the future of AOE II:HD. I am an engineer and I will never be cleared to speculate about upcoming patches or release dates or anything like that. If this were one of our self published titles, but because this is a Microsoft title it would be extremely inappropriate for me to leak information about what may be coming in the future. All I can say is that the work this community has been doing is easily worth $100k in private testing and that I read this subreddit multiple times a day.

Primary Goals

- Remove the older and deprecated DirectPlay layer and replace it with a current network communication framework (p2p session management and message authentication

- Implement basic matchmaking functionality for quick matches

Stretch Goals

- Implement advanced matchmaking features such as skill based ranking

- Allow mod community support and make it easy for users to share mods

- Implement stats

- Introduce a current generation anti-cheat system



Releasing the game on Steam with Steamworks libraries helped make these features fit within our timeframe. Not only did Steamworks provide a base of functionality which matched our goals

When Age of Empires II was written 14 years ago

In the end, but over the course of development, many other programmers had hacked in their own bits and pieces of code. I was overwhelmed, so I did the only sensible thing that I could think of – I tracked down every piece of networking logic and injected logging, on screen messages, and forced stops. What began to emerge through this process was a real understanding of what exactly was going on at the lower levels of the multiplayer code.

Those first few weeks were harrowing and often confusing, stable, fairly well understood replication of the original high level functionality, all running through Steam. On top of that, during the same period, our amazing internal test team (Lead by Mark Shoemaker and Jon Lee) deployed a set of automated testing tools that are the best I have seen. Regardless of whether I was home programming late at night, or in the office chasing down an obscure synchronization error, with our primary goals met and the security of knowing that we would be able to test out anything new with hundreds of hours' worth of automated multiplayer matches

I think you are going to be extremely pleased with how things have turned out. The new matchmaking system delivers what you would expect from a modern game. You can filter by player skill, etc. There is a global ranking system and 190 new online and offline achievements. We have done our best to ensure that the Steam Workshop integration is smooth and that it will be of great value to the big name modders as well as the amateur map and scenario designers. For obvious reasons I cannot reveal details on the new anti-cheat system, but I will say that I had a fun time exploring existing cheats as well as planning for the future. 

I am very proud to have my name on this release and I very much hope you enjoy Age of Empires II HD.",self,t5_2sg7u,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1c4fpi/age_of_empires_ii_hd_developers_diaries_part_4/

TWOOOO

ANALYSESESESE IN HISTORYRRYRYRRY

**CHANGES TO THE NEW CIVS**

TODAY I'M DOING SOMETHING REALY FAST BY ANALYSITIZING THE NEW BONUSES AND TECHS AND CHANGES THE OLD CIVS HAVE BEFORE I START GO HAM (HARD AS A MOTHERFUCKER) AT THE NEW CIVS.

[FOR THOSE NOT IN THE KNOW HERE'S THE CHANGELOG STRAIGHT FROM THE FORGOTTEN EMPIRES DEVS THEMSELVES](http://www.forgottenempires.net/features/changelog/)

**[AZTECS: MEXICA UP

* Free Loom removed

This is more about balance than historical accuracy and there doesn't seem to be a particular idea the Aztecs free Loom in the first place. This is related to the next bonus...

* Start with +50 gold

In The Conquerors, Azteccy choice: will you sacrifice the durability of your Villagers and leave them vulnerable to Wolves and other Drushes in order to go for your own 8-man (you'd mine the extra 10 gold) Drush? Will the Nahua peoples (not quite Aztec/Mexica in the Dark Age) wrest a homeland from the complacent and stagnant Mesoamerican tribes by force?

* UNIQUE UNIT: Jaguars Warriors: +1 pierce armor

The Jags in The Conquerors didn't even have base pierce armor! This meant that they really sucked against archers (while Eagle sucked against melee). This is for game balance but also very historically accurate because the Jags would have had fine arrow-resistance thanks to the cotton armor prevalent in Mesoamerica.

* UNIQUE TECH: Atlatl: Skirmishers +1 Attack

Alright so the Aztecs finally get their signature weapon! The Atlatl is almost a sling type weapon that fires a dart, costing Food and Gold except this one is available in the Castle Age and it makes your Castle Elite Skirmishers as strong as an Elite Skirmisher in the Imperial Age. EDIT: Skirmishers have never benefited from Thumb Ring, so this is a pretty good tech. Aztec Archers lack Ring Archer Armor so their ESkirms vs other ESkirms are not as effective but +1 attack and range is alot for Skirmishers and makes them better in other situations.

**[BRITONS: JUNIAH SPESH JUNIAH JUNIAH JUNIAH JUNIAH SPESH ONE POUND AND FIFTY PENCE FIFTY PENCE FIFTY PENCE](http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/r7fe4/hameplay_vs_gistoricity_day_9_the_britons/)**

[AN' MAYONNAISE IS TWENTY PENCE MORE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s760qkHGfG4)

* UNIQUE TECH: Warwolf: Trebuchets have a broader splash damage.

Warwolf was the name of a huge Trebuchet that Edward Longshanks used in the defense of Stirling Castle against the Scots, you will probably win Treb wars as the Britons, even against the Huns. And thanks to the British Siege Engineers, I think these are the best Trebs in the game after the Japanese.

Now most of the new Unique Techs are available in the Castle Age but this one would make no sense there. Thus another change has happened

* UNIQUE TECH: Yeoman: Now available in Castle Age

Yowza, now have 9 Range in the Castle Age. Longbowmen have 10 Range. This is a pretty nice boost to have, no doubt. As far as it's historicity...there's a mind-blowing amount of historicity here because Yeoman used to be the word to describe those minor lords who could afford horses and full suits of armor while knights used to be the word for his trainees who bathed him and rubbed oil on his...armor. Also the British were arguably at their strongest at the end of the Castle Age when Plantagenet Dynasty created the “Angevin Empire,” holding half of Ireland, Acquitaine, Brittany, Normandy, and Toulouse and having Scotland

* UNIQUE UNIT: Longbowman -1 creation time

This is probably to encourage the players to actually use Longbowmen. Most players would opt for Arbalests by virtue of their creation from the Archery Range. Longbows are ideal but they come from the Castle and are harder to mass.

* DOCKS: get Cannon Galleon

There was no reason for the British to lack Cannon Galleons starting with Age of Kings but now they get it. Now their Cannon Galleons need to somehow be better than Spanish Cannon Galleons in order to recreate the Battle of Gravelines...

* SIEGE WORKSHOP: get Heavy Scorpions

The British have always been a premiere user of siege tech in Europe and it was a wonder why their Siege wasn't better in previous iterations of Age of Empires 2. Well

**[BYZANTINES: I'M LIKE A MEDIEVAL WOLVERINE MADE OF BYZANTIUM!](http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/q253f/civ_gameplay_vs_history_day_3_the_byzantines/)**

* UNIQUE TECH: Greek Fire: Fire Ships +1 Range

If you're name is not Galleon

**[CELTS: THEY LOVE FUCKING SHEEP](http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/u2eg9/faster_than_a_trade_cog_less_armor_than_a_gothic/)**

* UNIQUE TECH: Strongholds: Castles fire +20% faster

I would have named this Tower House or something, with one of the best economic techs for the early and midgame and a ridiculous Siege army for the late. The Celts were fierce in their defense of the homeland (it's kind of their defining trait) and Scottish Archers were way better than they are depicted in AoE2 so maybe this is a reference to that.

* UNIQUE TECH: Furor Celtica: Siege Weapons now get +40% HPs

Some felt the Celts were overpowered with Furor Celtica (suck it Kevin Garnett!) so this is a welcome change. The current Slavic civ suspiciously hits a few of the same niches as the Celts do (they're an Infantry and Siege civ) and have cheaper Siege. Normally cheaper is better and they are 15% cheaper. However

**[CHINESE: LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS BITCH](http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/qan78/epic_civ_analyses_in_historrreeehhhh_day_5_the/)**

* Town Centers +5 LoS

This is a neat little bonus intended to give you a good start at the beginning of the game. The Chinese Villager bonus was a double-edged sword if you couldn't find your Sheep and Berries early but now you can. You could say that this is jaw-droppingly historical because the Chinese always had a pretty firm idea of what land belonged to them (until very recently

* UNIQUE TECH: Great Wall (walls +30% Hps)

This isn't quite the Byzantine +40% in the Imperial Age but it matches them in the Castle Age. I dunno

**[FRANKS: HOH HOH WE FREANCH ARE BETTAR THAN DE REST OF ZE YOOROPEANS HOH HOH FREANCH IS ZE LANGUAGE OF SEX HOH HOH HOH HOHO HOHO HOHHH HOHOHO HOHOHOHHOH OHOHOHHHOHOHOHOH HHHOOHOHOH OH MY](http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/pwcd7/civ_gameplay_and_history_analysis_day_1_the_franks/)**

* Foragers work +25% faster

The Franks were quite one-dimensional in AoE2 and didn't really have too much OOMPH. This is a small change that gives adds to their somewhat lackluster economic bonus

* UNIQUE UNIT: Throwing Axemen (non-Elite): missile delay -2 (frames?)

Castle Age Throwing Axemen fire faster now. This is pretty nice because that makes sense as an advantage of the throwing axe in real life. It didn't need to be drawn like a Bow. This also makes the Franks a bit stronger overall. The cheaper Elite TAxemen research is quite nice because it's very hard to get out fully upgraded Paladins AND fully upgrades TAxemen

* UNIQUE TECH: Chivalry: Stables work +40% faster

Grab me by the ballsack and call me a monkey's anus this is pretty badass. AND IT'S A CASTLE AGE TECH. This makes the Frankish Castle Age pretty boss (and the Imperial Age, think about how anti-Monk the Franks are now. Thanks to certain changes, like the Saracens Madrasah tech, people will probably use more Monks and the Franks can kill all of the heathen Mahomeddans! ...at least until they give up and go home in the Imperial Age. This also makes a nice parallel to the cousin of the Franks, the Goths.

* BARRACKS: get Squires

The reason why this was left out in the first place was probably because Ensemble Studios thought that the Throwing Axemen would be too powerful with their ranged attack. Their range is kind of pitiful so they actually need to be a bit faster to compensate for the terribleness of the French Archers. Also

**[GOTHS: THEY'LL FUCK YOU LIKE ANIMALS](http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/riyad/gameplay_vs_historicititiciticiticiticity_day_10/)**

* Infantry cost -35% starting in Feudal Age.

Wait a goddamn minute

* UNIQUE TECH: Perfusion: Barracks work +100% faster

I haven't had time in the past few days to crunch the numbers, and tallness and fierceness. “Undisciplined” Gothic Hordes managed to defeat “disciplined” Roman Legions. I put “undisciplined” in quotations because the Goths had been in contact with Roman warfare for a long time and I also put “disciplined” in quotations because the Legions were mostly a shadow of their former selves by late Antiquity. But it's good characterization and AoE2 gets rampaging Gothic Infantry and Forgotten Empires magnifies that. EDIT: The stats for Perfusion has always been 100% faster creation time. Again the in-game tech tree was wrong.

* DEFENSES: Treadmill Crane removed

This is pretty historically accurate and it might be necessary for gameplay purposes

**[HUNS: I FUCK BITCHES SMOKE WEED ALL DAY YA'LL CAN CALL ME PIMPTILLA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/qn17k/its_that_time_again_civ_vs_history_analysis_day_7/)**

* Cavalry Archers cost -15/20%

Oh thank fucking Cysion.

* UNIQUE UNIT: Tarkans (non-Elite): +10 Hps

Well it makes sense to make the Tarkans stronger earlier in the game

* UNIQUE TECH: Marauders: Tarkans created at the Stable

This is x-games level of historical accuracy because I don't think the Huns really had Castles and

* DEFENSES: removed Treadmill Crane

These changes are also testicle explodingly historically accurate. The Huns didn't have goddamn Stone Walls they were goddamn nomads and they didn't give too shits about Treadmill Cranes and engineering and medical advances and indoor plumbing. Fuck that we hit things with torches! And if I were Bleda the Hun

**WHAT IS THE POINT**

Aiight playa, and get everybody else's input. The main hook of this game is that the playable factions are based on history, so I'm going to perform a little reverse engineering and figure out how the game designers made their design choices.

Keep in mind

But alot of choices were made on history

**A SMALL TIDBIT OF FRANKISH HISTORY**

The Franks in Age of Empires 2 represent the Kingdom of France, the Franks are used to represent Italian factions, as well.

The Franks were a Germanic tribe who eventually formed a kingdom that was technically under Roman Imperial jurisdiction, distantly related to the Vikings, and can be considered precursors of the Teutons, and their relation to the Teutons is pretty interesting.

The Frankish Empire formed by Charlemagne was divided for his 3 sons after Charlemagne died into East Francia, the nation the Teutons are based on. The land known as Middle Francia would be fought over by Germany and France for about a thousand-ish years, up until the World War era.

**THE FRANKISH BONUSES**

* Castles cost -25%

France doesn't quite have the most castellation in one area of Europe, the Middle East and most famously in England. The consolidated their holdings by building massive fortresses, and the Castle cost reduction bonus reflects the far flung Castles of common origin. The French, however, ARE responsible for the creation of Castles for the Crusaders in the Middle East.

* Knights +20% HPs

The Franks in AoE2 have strong Infantry, used lots of foot soldiers while the elites would ride to the battle on horses, but not during battle. Eventually they switched to a true heavy cavalry force during the reign of Charlemagne and they used armored cavalry well past the timeframe of AoE2 (AoE3 has Cuirassiers!). Charlemagne had many military successes thanks to the power, speed, and durability of the Knight. The Franks had many conflicts with many horse-cultures from Central Asia including the Huns and the Avars, who brought the stirrup into Europe. The stirrup allows the rider to actually stay on the saddle while smashing into somebody with a lance, which is one key component of the Middle Ages heavy cavalry style. The other component is the personal and horse armor, who adopted armored cavalry from the Persians and Iranian tribes such as the Sarmatians

* Farm upgrades free (requires Mill)

Modern-day France is a very fertile land full of plains and rivers and stuff. Known as Gaul in Roman times, France is the second largest exporter and the sixth biggest producer of food in the world, and the EU's biggest agricultural center. Thus the Franks get a Farming bonus. It's not as good as the Teutons' bonus, which further shows the sisterhood of the two civilizations, but that might be for the sake of balance. The Franks didn't actually discover the Horse Collar or the Heavy Plow or Crop Rotation, though.

* TEAM BONUS: Knights +2 LoS

There is no historical basis for the Knight LoS bonus. The heavy helmets could be pretty hard to see through, he can see injustices from a longer distance.

To summarize

**THE FRANKISH TECH TREE**

* UNIQUE UNIT: Throwing Axeman

The Franks were renowned for their dudes who would chuck Axes at you. AoE2 has dudes throwing big ass axes at their enemies which is pretty freaking cool, the Frankish unique unit represents the strong infantry that the Franks used as a result of their Germanic origin. The Throwing Axeman in game complements the Paladin extremely well, and vice versa. They each perform well against each other's counters, which might be a reference to Charlemagne's successful army. Earlier Frankish infantry armies were meh, and later Frankish heavy cavalry-centered armies were dominated by the British but the combined armies allowed for the height of Frankish power. The Vikings and Goths would also throw axes at guys, too, but the Franks were most famous for them because...

* UNIQUE TECH: Francisca

~~The Franks take their name from the throwing axe they use, if you make a scenario where a Viking, Gothic, or Teuton civ has Throwing Axemen, none of them will have the extra range like the Franks. wink wink.

* BARRACKS: no Eagle Warriors

The Franks have access to 3 Infantry units; the regular joe and easy to create Champion, of course, but they had problems with archers. So, they get a little bit more variety in their non-archers. Due to the prevalence of Heavy Cavalry in France, the Swiss, the Dutch, the Belgians, and other small nations around France innovated massed Pike formations to counter Heavy Cavalry, which is Husbandry.

* ARCHERY RANGE: no Arbalest, no Bracer, no Ring Archer Armor

I'm not going to do a separate Blacksmith section because the Blacksmith techs are purely for balance. If they weren't, etc. So anyway, the Franks always had poor experience with Archers. Their Archers weren't particularly good and true to history most European archers forces were pretty terrible. The exceptions in AoE are the Byzantines, the Britons, and the Vikings. So the Franks, Teutons, Celts, and sort of the Spanish get bad archers. The strongest archer civilizations were historically in Asia. The Franks do get Hand Cannoneers

* STABLE: no Camels

Even though they are technically a Cavalry civ, though the Teutons is worse.

* SIEGE WORKSHOP: no Siege Ram

The Franks made extensive use of siege weapons. There isn't anything particularly notable I can talk about, when combined with Siege Engineers. The Franks could have adopted much of their siege technology from the Romans, who had very sophisticated weaponry.",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/pwcd7/civ_gameplay_and_history_analysis_day_1_the_franks/

The Hidden Path team was presented with some interesting problems when updating Age of Empires II. Part of it came down to: What could we do with the assets we had access to? What could we do without affecting the fundamental game play? (Unit recognition

We focused first on the UI. This was something we could plan on up front and start work on while the programmers dug into the guts of the engine to determine what was feasible from our list of things we wanted to upgrade. We took elements from the original UI images (single texture per resolution size of the original game) and broke each of the selected images (per civilization) up into individual sections. This allowed us to create sections that could be set or tiled and allow for variable screen sizes on the fly.

One of the engine upgrades included updating the terrain pipeline to a 32bit texture system. This would allow us to update terrain textures without being restricted by the palettes of the original system. The first terrain element we focused on was water. The programmers gave us animating normals

Anything that can be placed on the terrain in the editor is considered to be on the unit layer which remained 8-bit

As more terrain features came in ( light maps, etc.), we decided to focus on the impact on terrain elements from the unit layer. We were able to come up with a custom palette system so that we were no longer restricted to the original palette set. This gave us the necessary flexibility for a wider range of colors that we could use per feature. Trees, cliffs faces, fire effects, to name a few, were all updated as a result of these upgraded custom palette features that were added to the engine.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1bmim7/age_of_empires_ii_hd_developers_diaries_part_3/

**ITALIAN HISTORY IS LIKE PASTA: IT'S PROCESSED AND MADE OF WHEAT...WUT**

In Forgotten Empires, the city states of Milan, Padua, Ravenna, Verona, Venice, Genoa, Florence, Amalfi, Sardinia

After the fall of Rome, established dominion there. You could almost say that the Germans created the idea of the European city-states. A vast Empire broken apart into many small pieces thanks to the German migrants loyal only to their chieftains. Even Germany would be a very broken up patchwork of territories and free cities right up to the early modern era.

Now when I write my analyses, MUSLIMS SACKING THE POPE'S HOUSE! It would have been a bigger deal if the location of the Christianity's heart wasn't in dispute at the time. The Byzantines held much of south Italy at the time and they exerted influence over the Bishop of Rome, the Pope.

The Emirate of Sicily was eventually conquered by Normans at the behest of the Pope, in southern Italy and then even further to the Balkans! Norman Sicily had elements of Norman, Italian, and Moorish culture because the Norman kings were fairly tolerant of the learned Moors.

Meanwhile Northern Italy was being preyed upon by the Holy Roman Empire, French, and Spaniards all got involved and the Frenchies even convinced Scotland to invade England at the same time. Hell the Ottomans fought in Italy as allies of the French. This incredible chain of conflicts could be considered the climax of the Middle Ages as many different armies turned Italy into a huge battleground, with sieges and battles and pikemen and knights and artillery. It was basically like playing a post-Imperial Death Match with the Teutons, Spanish, Franks, Britons, and maybe the Goths if you want to pretend they're the smaller German principalities or the Hapsburgs.

During the Middle Ages the Italians spread again all over the place, was the main Genoese colony there and traded with the Mongol Golden Horde and even with the surviving remnants of the Italian's old nemeses, the Goths. The Venetians bribed the army of the Fourth Crusade to attack Constantinople and a French-speaking empire briefly reigned in Greece. It was the Venetian Marco Polo who traveled all across the Mongol Empire all the way to China. The most infamous Genoese of all Christopher Colombus opened the Americas to European invasion. Safavid Persia employed Italians as ambassadors to Europe.

The Italians have crossed paths with early Celts, Byzantines, French, Spanish, British, Teutons, Magyars, Turks

**MARGE I COULDN'T GET MY CHRISTMAS BONUS THIS YEAR HOMER BART GOT A TATTOO AND I'VE USED ALL OUR SAVINGS TO REMOVE IT NO ITALIAN BONUS FOR YOU**

* Age Advancement costs -10%

The Italians were hit hard by the root causes of the Dark Ages such as the Germanic and Turkic migrations but they bounced back quite quickly. Their Feudal era had been in place as soon as the many German tribes began to invade. The Germanic tribes brought with them a fervent loyalty to their local leaders as opposed to the centralized government of the Romans. A Castle Age of fortresses could be considered to be in Italy first due to the Roman fortification 
traditions combined with the many city-states who needed to create defenses in order to hold their ground. A grand age of Imperial expansion was always on the Italian shopping list alongside wine, which makes alot of sense.

* Docks techs cost -50%

Think about Italy's geography: smack dab in the middle of a sea with the path to the mainland blocked by some big ass mountains. So you're going to take to the water. Now think about Italy's history: the Roman Empire
economically. The maritime republics would forge colonies around the Sea, now could they?

* Gunpowder units cost -15%

The Italians made very, then 300 Food and 200 Gold for Chemistry and you're making them, unlike a Siege Ram that needs 1300 Food spread between 2 upgrades total. Instead of cheaper Infantry, the Italians take the bonuses of their former overlords the Goths, Lombards, and Vandals and instead apply it to Gunpowder.

* Fishing Ships +2 LoS

The Italians were most active in the Mediterranean, Arabs, and Turks. The Italians knew the waters they were navigating quite well. Fishing Ships with extra LoS is a pretty good bonus for those crucial early stages of the game and helps offset their sometimes dumb AI.

* TEAM BONUS: Condottiero available in the Imperial Age

The Italians have a sort of an “ultimate teammate” feel to them. The Italian city-states were very independent from each other and the other nations of Europe and frequently played large games of chess with various powers. Genoa, the Swiss, the Burgundians, the French, the German Holy Roman Empire, the Austrians, the Byzantines, the Normans, mercenaries were very important to fill out their armies and there was no way to regulate Italians joining the armies of other nations. So the Condottiero,False

Ya best protect ya neck

**A SMALL HISTORY LESSON ABOUT THE TEUTONS**

The Teutons represent the various polities, kingdoms, republics, city-states, duchies, counties, princedoms, but are not limited to, Shwaben, Switzerland (Burgundy)

Charlemagne's Frankish Empire was split into West Francia,"" and in Latin the title is ""Rex Teutonicorum,"" which is why our German friends are known as Teutons.

Otto I the Great was crowned as King of Italy

There's a famous saying that the Holy Roman Empire was neither Holy nor Roman, but the title was nominal and did not come with any real strength. The Emperor was technically in control of the entire nation, but only had the resources of his home state. The Holy Roman Empire would occasionally have control of Italy but never after the Middle Ages. During the early modern era the HRE did not have Church authority so it wasn't Holy and since it lacked Italy it wasn't Roman.

The Teutons are related to the Franks. The Goths are among the first Germanic peoples to appear in recorded history and can be considered the predecessors of the Teutons. The Goths came from Scandinavia, such as the Saxons, the Jutes, the Danes, and the Angles invaded the British Isles so the Teutons are related to the Britons (Anglo-Saxons), as well.

A Germanic tribe known as the ""Teutons"" was also running amok in the Roman Empire around the same time as the Goths, Alans, and Vandals, but they caused a much smaller ruckus than those other guys.

**THE TEUTONIC BONUSES**

* Monks heal from 2x as far

The Holy Roman Empire considered itself the Roman Empire except with the blessings of the Pope. So, Templar Knights, and Hospitallers were all Monk-warrior Orders, so having Monks who can do their thing on the battlefield makes alot of sense in this regard

* Towers garrison 2x units

The Teutons were historically known for running to the nearest tower and stuffing themselves in twice as efficiently as every other civilization at the time. Okay, and difficult to take not just by Hungarians, Avars, French, Vikings, or Italians, but by other Teutons! The Teutonic Knights were well-known for slowly pushing through Eastern Europe, towers allow you to mirror the Teutonic Knights' aggressive defensive encroachment tactics. Also

* Murder Holes free

The Teutons didn't invent any particular fortification system, which brings us to...

* Farms cost -33%

Germany had plenty of arable land for farming. Pretty much the entirety of Europe is ripe for farming. Today, which makes sense since they had were doing well for themselves in the Dark Age while the Teutons didn't technically even exist yet. Oh well.

* Town Center +2 attack/+5 LoS

Ahhh, like I detailed earlier, the Holy Roman Empire was a patchwork of states, from the small to the large. The Teutons have a bonus for every defense except for walls, and you can infer that every town in Germany was fortified.

* TEAM BONUS: Units more resistant to conversion

Since the Teutons represent the Crusading Orders

So for our Teutons, the Teutons get a defensive bonus applicable per age: this one for Dark Age, Towers 2x garrison for Feudal, Murder Holes for Castle, and super Bombard Towers and super Castles for Imperial. Every town has a good agricultural base and on top of that, the Empire has the blessings of the Church. Gawddamn, son.

**TEUTONIC TECH TREE**

* UNIQUE UNIT: Teutonic Knight

The Teutonic Knight is named after the real life order of Teutonic Knights. The Teutonic Knights actually fought mostly from horseback, HP, and decent pierce armor but it's so slow that it fails against archers. The Huskarl slays Archers but dies to other Infantry and Cavalry, but is still good against fortifications thanks to it's high pierce armor. As for the Berserks...uhh...they both have capes?

* UNIQUE TECH: Crenelations

Yet another defensive tech. The main shred of historicity we can gleam from this tech is that Infantry can fire arrows (they fire the same number as Villagers) when garrisoned in things. This is probably related to the Teutonic Knights who, and then they can huddle inside and fire arrows from it. Coolio.

* BARRACKS: no Eagle Warriors

The Teutons get most Infantry techs just like their cousins, Vikings, and Franks. I mentioned that I like to think of the TK as a dismounted Knight, but what does that make the Champion? The flavor text in AoE2's manual states that your regular joe infantry guy could become rich enough after surviving a few battles to buy himself armor and a sword, so I think the Champion is a man of common birth who is well off enough to buy some equipment. The Teutons also get Halberdiers, and you can bet your ass that the various German states came up with massed Spear formations to counter the Heavy Cavalry. The Swiss, in particular

* ARCHERY RANGE: no Arbalest, no Parthian Tactics, no Bracer.

Very similar to the Franks and Goths, preventing their crazy defenses from being unstoppable. But they don't really need Bracer because 1 - they have Crenelations and 2 - if you look above, you'll notice that they get Hand Cannoneers and you can PUT THEM IN BOMBARD TOWERS OMG TWO CANNONBALLS

**SO YOU WANNA KNOW ABOUT THEM MONGOLS!?**

The Mongols in Age of Empires 2 represent the Mongol Empire that came out of Mongolia and conquered much of the known world. The Mongols are occasionally used to represent nomadic tribes such as the Scythians.

Mongolia is a part of the steppes that stretch from Europe to Asia, Iranian, and Turko-Mongol peoples such as the Avars, Bulgars, Magyars, Khazars, Sarmatians, Alans, Huns, Kazakhs

Prior to Ghengis Khan, and then they would start to argue amongst themselves and the Chinese would snicker and laugh at them.

Finally, super-intelligent, and super-ruthless dude named Ghengis Khan took the reigns of the nomad tribes and forced them to do something about their situation. He did what no other confederation leader did before: he broke up the tribes and enforced strict unity. If you submitted to the will of the Mongols and you were conscripted into their army, Ghengis tried his best to make sure you would be considered a Mongol and not an outsider. As you know from playing the single player campaigns in AoE2, they beat up each other, they beat up a rival confederation (the Khara-Kitai Khanate), they beat up China, and they beat up much of Eastern Europe, and the Arabs.

The Mongol Empire would fragment, was technically the leader of the Mongol successor states, but they were all pretty much independent. The Golden Horde in Russia, the Ilkhanate in Persia and Turkey, and the Chagatai Khante in Central Asia (today's Kazakhstan) would linger for about a century or so until THEY broke into smaller groups and left their descendants behind, such as the Tatars in Russia. One Mongolic group, the Mughals

The Mongols are related to the Turks and the Huns

**THE MONGOL BONUSES**

* Cavalry Archers fire +20% faster

The Mongols' primary weapon was the Cavalry Archer. The Cavalry Archer was a combination of speed, and their horses were bred for speed. Because they did not wear much armor, the Mongol horses had stamina that the heavy chargers of Europe did not. Back in those days, a Cavalry Archer was just plain unfair. He'd nail you pretty hard with an arrow, and then run away before you could do anything, if you weren't already dead. You'd need a pretty damn accurate bow (such as a Chinese crossbow) to retaliate. However, Cavalry Archers were pretty rare because each man needed a lifetime of training. Like I mentioned earlier, the steppes of Asia are perfect training grounds and a Mongol man would get his training, offensive bonus.

* Light Cavalry +30% HPs

Another qualitative bonus. The majority of the Mongol army did not wear much armor. They saw the benefits of heavy cavalry and used them on occasion, and after that are the Mangudai and Camels, and then the Cavalry Archers. The Mongol armies were known for their extreme mobility. No other army could match them. Even with the HP bonus, Mongol Light Cavalry and Hussars still don't beat the units that normally beat them (such as Camels and Knights), but they do end up lasting alot longer and make good, cheap meatshields for the Mongol cav archers and siege weapons. Hussars are extremely good at running in to the enemy camp, killing their most valuable units (Monks, and occasionally Archers), so this bonus is not quite as good as one would like it to be; in fact

* Hunters work 50% faster

You've probably seen youtube vids about Mongol dudes hunting using falcons and horses. They've been doing that for thousands of years! So of course they get a hunting bonus. The Mongol Army was different from other armies of the time because each man was a skilled hunter and could find his own food, so it plays in to their nomadic lifestyle. Plus it allows them to make the vaunted Scout Cavalry rush in the Feudal Age. Mongols like Cavalry!

* TEAM BONUS: Scout Cavalry line +2 Line of Sight

Another piece to the Mongol success puzzle was their superior scouting and intelligence. The Mongols would have the lay of the land sooner than their enemies would have liked them to, rivers, and guessing about enemy troop plans. Your Scout Cavalry in the beginning of the game is your only eye into seeing what your enemies are planning on doing, and so this bonus starts in the Dark Age and goes all through the game. The Mongols also had very, very good communications, relaying messages through horns, flags, arrows


**MONGOL TECH TREE**

* UNIQUE UNIT: Mangudai

The word ""Mangudai"" is from a Mongol tribe known as the Mangits or the Manghuds. After the Mongol Empire fragmented, Russia, and Kazakhstan. Some western sources believe that the Mongols had a cadre of suicide troops known as the Mangudai, who were the craziest of the crazy Mongols. The Mangudai is a super cavalry archer, and you'll notice in gameplay that he fires instantly as soon as you click on an enemy (if enough time has passed since he fired his last shot). Mangudai are also the second fastest, regular unit in the game tying with the Camel and just under the Light Cavalry (making them faster than the Cavalry Archer line). Mangudai also have more range, attack, making them Heavy Cavalry Archers during the Castle Age. On the downside, just like how Mongol Cavalry Archers were the best in their day.

[Steam Global Achievements for ValveTestApp221380](http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUserStats/GetGlobalAchievementPercentagesForApp/v0002/?gameid=221380) The interesting thing is that I checked the global achievements several days ago and there were only two test achievements; also if you notice the percentages on the achievements which means that people / developers are actively playing the game on Steam!

1330481518.0,qan78,EPIC CIV ANALYSES IN HISTORRREEEHHHH DAY 5: The Chinese,TheBattler,65,5,10,"BRRRRING HELLO BITCH

I RANG

YEA BITCH

FROM NOW ON

**WORD TO YA MOTHER ABOUT THE CHINESE**

The Chinese in AoE2 seem to represent a fairly diverse group of  ethnicities and dynasties. For instance, Ghengis Khan does battle with 5 Chinese factions; the unimportant ""Engineers,"" the Xi Xia, the Tanguts, the Jin, and the Song. The Xi Xia and the Tanguts were the same dynasty, the Tanguts being the lead ethnicity (currently of unknown origin) of the Xi Xia and referred to by their Chinese subjects, and Mongols as ""White Mongols."" The Jin were a Dynasty led by the Jurchen

The Song are the main inspiration for the Chinese civilization as presented by AoE2 and they are the ""true, as well as the Republic of China in Taiwan. The Song were around from 960 - 1279, until being defeated by the Mongols. Their predecessors, the Tang Dynasty, ruled a united China from 618-907. The Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty united China and Mongolia from 1271-1368, and finally the Han Chinese Ming Dynasty held China from 1368-1644 to round out the Middle Ages.

The Chinese civilization has been around prior to that for pretty much ever starting with the Shang Dynasty (they were in AoE1) in 1600 BC. The Shang claim to have wrested control of China from the (currently) mythological Xia Dynasty, and they investigated earlier dynasties as well as keeping records for later ones.

The Chinese have such a comprehensive, the Tanguts, the Jurchen, the Tibetans, the Koreans, the Japanese, the Mongols, the Burmese, Turks

In my opinion, it's probably China (with Achaemenid Persia, the Roman Empire, the Abbasid Caliphate, and good ol' US of A providing the main competition).

The Song Dynasty in particular was pretty freaking nuts. Their main strength was their high population, but they also had standardized measurements for spears, arrows, swords, armor pieces, etc. so that any Blacksmith can create and repair weapons. They were so good at metalworking, they used as much charcoal as Industrial Revolution era England, bombs, among other things.

The Chinese in AoE2 had contact with the Turks, the Koreans, the Persians, the Saracens, and the Byzantines. They greatly influenced the Koreans, Mongols, and Japanese greatly

**THA CHINESE BONUSES MAYYNE**

* Start with +3 Villagers; -200 F

The Chinese political states have always had a very high percentage of the world's population within their borders. Today, some academics estimate the population was 500 million. And you can bet that it was even smaller in 1120. At one point, the Song had about a quarter of the total human population in the entire world! The food and wood reduction is obviously for balance sake, but there's a couple of deeper issues here. In actual gameplay, the Chinese player has to dick around for about 30 seconds before his Scout Cavalry manages to find some Sheep and send it to the Town Center. In that time, the Chinese player may have gathered enough Wood to offset his wood reduction. It takes another 30 seconds or so for the villagers to gather enough Food to start production of Villies. Every other civ will have created a couple of villagers by then, thus offsetting the Chinese bonus a little bit. If you aren't experienced, this is a definite bonus. This is the case for China in history. Proper management of their huge population led to their success. Mismanagement, one will receive the Mandate of Heaven and rise out above the rest. This new state will enter a period of prosperity before the Mandate withdraws. When there is a famine or high flooding

* Town Centers support +10 Population

Again, and they settled a large territory. A Town Center basically signifies a new town or an expansion to a an existing Town.

* Demolition Ships +50% HPs

Ehh. The Demolition Ship itself is not very accurate to history, they sort of suck but that's another issue entirely. Real Demolition Ships didn't quite explode, but the flavor text of the manual states that they were set on fire and sailed into the enemy ship formations where the winds would carry the flames onto the targets. It was still a suicide attack on the part of the ship itself, it just didn't happen in a spectacular BOOM. I mentioned when I analyze the Byzantines that the Fire Ship in the game is a purely Byzantine one, but the Chinese had analogous ships except they used gunpowder bombs and flamethrowers. It seemed like the developers wanted to give the Chinese a gunpowder related naval bonus, but they already gave the obvious ones to the Byzantines (Fire ship attack speed) and the Turks (the HP bonus). So they cam up with this one. There's still some history to be gleamed, though. This is a ""useless"" bonus and it fits because while the Song Dynasty Chinese were great ship builders, by the end of the Middle Ages the Chinese had the biggest fleet in the world (and that's because Shipwright is cheaper for them). The Demo Ship is also the fastest unit in the game (I think the Trade Cog might be faster, and explodey Demolition Ships in AoE2

* Technologies cost -10/15/20% starting in Feudal Age

Now, they had a massive everything. This was probably the most broad, general bonus they could give the Chinese while still being balanced. And as a result, the Chinese have a strategy for just about everything! Their units aren't directly cheaper, but upgrades for them are. The Champion upgrade, for instance, costs them 150 F and 70 G less, so that's an extra two Siege Rams. That's sort of like the Chinese having a higher population or having standardized parts for their weapons and tools. Heavy Plow in the Castle Age is 108 Food instead of 125 Food and while that's not extremely high savings

* TEAM BONUS: Farms +45 F

China had to have strong agriculture in order to feed it's massive population. They get a free 45 Food,False,self,t5_2sg7u,False,,Blank,t3_qan78

**A SMALL TIDBIT ABOUT THE BYZANTINES UP IN HERRR**

The Byzantines in Age of Empires 2 represent the Byzantine Empire, and some Crusader states. They are also used to represent the naval-oriented Italian factions, such as Genoa and Venice.

We call them the Byzantines, prior called *Byzantium*. Constantinople was occasionally referred to as Nova Roma. A Byzantine man would call himself a Roman. The Byzantine Empire considered themselves the Roman Empire, and carried on the military, societal, and administrative traditions of Rome. When the Turks conquered Anatolia from the Byzantines, they called the area ""Rum,"" a Turkish pronunciation of Rome

The Roman Empire was first split into four ruled by a Tetrarchy; Italy, France (Gaul) and Britain another, the Balkans the third, and Turkey (Anatolia), Egypt, and Israel, Jordan

Due to the capital being in Greece, and because of that they had many enemies. The Germanic movements into Europe mostly spread from the east and into the west, so many barbarian tribes encountered the Byzantines but then went on to Rome; these tribes include the Goths, the Huns, the Slavs, the Magyars, and the Avars. The Vikings even had a few conflicts with Constantinople, the Persian Empire. When the Arabs came running full sprint out of Arabia, taking them from the Goths and Vandals for a time.

The Eastern Roman Empire had Rome for only a century until the Lombards invaded Italy

The Byzantine Empire, later, the Teutonic Holy Roman Empire their vassals (as both civilizations posited themselves as the successors of Rome). The Goths would imitate Roman customs and tradition when setting up their kingdoms in Italy and Spain, and in turn the Spanish obviously are descendants of Rome. The Magyars and Bulgars would imitate the Byzantines in setting up their states. The Russians owed a great debt to the Byzantines in terms of culture with architectural and religious influences easily seen and when Constantinople fell in 1453, Ivan III would marry the niece of the last Byzantine Emperor and call Moscow the Third Rome, especially because the Greek Orthodox religion had found it's last bastion of protection there.

Constantinople was actually conquered by Crusaders (the Republic of Venice paying off German and Frankish Crusaders to take Constantinople) during what was supposed to be the Fourth Crusade. After 60 years of western European rule

The Saracens would study much of Roman and Greek culture, the Byzantine Wonder. The Ethiopians felt that they were brothers to the Byzantines, especially when the Muslim Arabs began conquering their lands.

**THE BYZANTINE BONUSES**

* Buildings +10/20/30/40% HPs starting in the Dark Age

A reference to the fact that the Romans were the premier builders of Europe. Roman buildings are still standing to this day, that's divided by 10 so then with Masonry and Architecture each Paladin does less damage. The total damage output drastically goes down. When enemies use Siege, however, the extra armor makes little difference and Byzantine buildings come out on top.

* Camels

I don't think this is an exact reference to any specialty of the Byzantine military, considered to be the bottom of the barrel soldiers in an army and you could infer that when the Byzantine Empire couldn't afford to keep a traditional Roman army of heavy infantry and Cataphracts, they turned to the cheaper and crappier soldiers. The Camel thing...doesn't really make *too* much sense, but the Byzantines used Camels in Arabia and even put armor on them!

* Fire Ships +20% attack

The developers intended there to be a rock-paper-scissors in AoE2 on the seas; Galleys defeat Demolition Ships before they get close, it is better to mass Galleys because they are practically Cavalry Archers on water and Fire Ships are essentially Pikemen. The Fire Ships' attack is pretty screwy, and does not work against Galleons that are properly microed by hitting and running. But we're here to talk about historicity. The Byzantines posses the ""best"" Fire Ship, and it makes sense because the Fire Ship is a specifically Byzantine Ship. If the Fire Ship was a Byzantine unique unit, that would be historically accurate as no other civ quite had Greek Fire (the Chinese, Koreans, and Indians would have analogous Ships utilizing gunpowder, but it's thought that Greek Fire is a napalm-type substance.

* Advance to Imperial Age costs -33%

You see, but their society just kept on trucking along. They kept most of the Roman military science, medicine, arts, etc. So it makes sense to give the Byzantines a leg up in this respect. They hit the Imperial Age sooner than anybody else. However, it would make more sense for them to have a faster Feudal Age or something because the timeframe of the Imperial Age really sucked for the Byzantines (since they got their asses handed to them the the Crusaders and Turks).

* Town Watch free

Not a super historical bonus, and the best buildings in Europe. Of course they'd be able to keep a better eye on their holdings than most.

* TEAM BONUS: Monks +50% heal speed

Constantinople was the bastion of Greek Orthodoxy, and thus the Pappas of Constantinople was considered to be the true Pappas of Christendom. Obviously since the one in Rome held a ton of authority, the Byzantines walked on eggshells in terms of diplomacy with them. Also, the word ""Catholic"" is derived from the Greek ""Katholikos,"" which means universal. You'll also notice that the Byzantines and the Teutons have a Monk heal bonus; the Holy Roman Empire is the closest thing in AoE2 to a Papal political entity.",,False,t5_2sg7u,True

1368470259.0,1e9d2e,This is why we love Age of Empires 2...,Sir_Joshula,60,10,19,"Every now and then in Age of Empires 2 you get a match up that is so close and a game that is so tight and action filled that you remember why you love this game. This weekend I had such a battle. I hope you enjoy the story...

The matchup was a 4v4 on Arabia and I chose China. I was playing with some friends; NoTt_MaG on the Huns and AssassinDave (henceforth Dave) as Spain, Pink (noob) and Yellow but I don't remember which civ he was.

I started the game on the border with Potter just behind me (right in the corner) and NoTt_MaG was just behind Dave on the other side. I had a pretty good start

I get feudal rushed! Yellow comes with scout cavalry but he's slow. I tower my wood. He also has militia and spearmen so I get some archers. He kills off a few of my deer hunters and slows me a bit but my archers and TC eventually kill of his rush. I managed to get my castle age going as well but I'm low on wood and gold so I can't spam the cav archers like I wanted to. Once I get 5 I make my way to yellow who has also castled by this stage. He has some palisade walls up but there's a gap and I get a lot of kills around his wood and gold which were together. He comes with knights but the terrain is to my advantage and he loses a couple and I run away.

*MEANWHILE on the other side of the map... from NoTt_MaG:*
&gt; Orange feudal rushed Dave. Killed 50% of his vills. Dave is on the ropes, drew his 4 spear within range of TC and my knights killed off his skirms.

*More from NoTt_MaG later.*

I'm too focused on my fight to really pay attention there but I know Orange is playing really well and NoTt_MaG is at his best to match him.

I'm trying my best to boom. Got 3 TCs going and still hitting and running with Cav Archers. I get a castle up quickly to protect my gold and have some skirmishers and archers about. I send 4 knights up to destroy some of orange's rams too after a plea for help. I still don't have cartography at this stage and then I see a flood of units in my base. 40 eagle warriors! I panicked
 
I get to imperial age and I start getting all the infantry upgrades and eventually amass 40 champions. I go straight for grey who is pissing everyone off with his mangudai! I get a couple of TC's but his main base is well structured with Castles and TCs and eventually I get annihilated! But that takes of the pressure from Potter who is now trebbing yellow's base. Orange is still attacking hard!

*NoTt_MaG:*

&gt; Dave retreats closer to my base, food and TCs. Both take big losses, but I’m a bit more destructive in his base than he is in mine, BUT he has all of Dave’s gold.  

&gt; I can’t let up my attack on his home because he is too strong,000 food. Grey comes knocking with 40 Mangudai, but easily pushed back by halbs/huss. I get about 50 hussars in orange's base which by now takes up about 1/3 of the map. Dave starts to get pikes in to stem oranges pals. Its at this point I notice he has been storing units in his siege workshops. UNLEASHES FURY on my main base which is quite compact, 20 siege rams and pals to boot. Hussars are too weak to smash the rams, so I call for help from Sir_Joshula and Dave. He takes out my castle and 5 TCs. Maybe 50 vils dead but together we fight him off. I start immediately to rebuild and build in exactly the same spaces asap. That rush cost his economy dear! He is reeling more than me when I get another 50 hussars in his farm land.

I expand to 5 TCs (one down the south near yellow's old base for the wood - which is now scarce). NoTt_MaG is fighting orange hard and now AssassinDave has recovered and is contributing with Halbs and Skirmishers. I get more barracks and have a constant stream of halberdiers slamming into orange's paladins. Darth Potter has cleared out yellow and is now attacking pink who is a noob but has lots of pesky castles! He also has the trade routes which NoTt_MaG had started attacking with hussars and I continued with Chu Ko Nus and a few scorpions.

*NoTt_MaG:*

&gt; I get about 20 hussars &amp; 10 pals in grey’s base and take out TC

&gt; I move straight to the trade lines and disrupt. I'm low on gold but Sir_Joshula has some to spare. He gives me 3000 gold just as Dave starts getting hand cannons and halbs.

&gt; I drop.    

NoTt_MaG has disconnected. I knew we were going to lose... Me and Dave could hold him back for a time but his onslaught is continuous! 

I have resources though (even though 3000g was just wasted). 

More barracks and castles built down towards pink and I amass another 40 champs with some Chu Ko Nus and some scorpions. I have skirmishers too to try to counter the inevitable mangudai. I go for grey again and also start sending a few units to orange's base (20 champs perhaps that kill villagers and TCs and eventually get killed off). I manage to cripple the trade routes by sitting the Chu Ko's and the scorps in the path. I kill most of grey's army and then eventually he kills my force but I know grey is out for quite a while. Darth Potter has taken out pink now (who quits) but back home he's in trouble because orange is going straight for him with the paladins! I keep the halberdiers flooding in...

I amass another squad. 60 champs

TL;DR - Go read it! It's glorious...",self,t5_2sg7u,1368479014.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1e9d2e/this_is_why_we_love_age_of_empires_2/

**Greetings Kings

We have a short interruption in our scheduled developer diary series today. At least
I'm Ryan Chaply, I want to spent today chatting about a feature I'm really excited for - user generated content.

We've got an amazing development team at Hidden Path getting the game running on today's machines, we wanted to make sure to incorporate all of the astonishing creativity from our community, both new and old. That meant there were a number of unique challenges we had to address through development.

When it came to the game engine, enabling scenario backwards compatibility. Due to player profile changes, this doesn't apply to saved games and replays, but this does mean the thousands of custom maps, scenarios, and campaigns can be easily replayed right in the new version. Even better, with the new multiplayer experience through Steam, shoot your friend an invite and off you go!

**Workshop!**

But this is more than just nostalgia. Over the last few weeks we've seen tons of questions about one of the coolest new features in Age of Empires II: HD Edition, promote, and share your works of art. 

Let's get the legal warning out of the way first. Please note

**Adding Workshop Content to your Game**

You've got several different routes to enter the workshop; either from within the game or the steam client itself. No matter how you enter, as well as collections and discussions to peruse. Filter down the list to pick out the mods you want to add, and go ahead and choose one that looks interesting. Our community team will be highlighting the best ones on the launcher from time to time, so keep an eye out!

Once you see something you like, or report it if the content shouldn't be there. To add it to your game, simply hit the 'subscribe' button, exit the game, and Steam will download it directly for you. Next time you launch the game, you'll have the workshop item installed! (Note: You will have to exit the *game client* completely in order for the mod to be recognized).

**Want to remove a mod?**

-Exit the game

-Right click AOE II: HD in your library, and verify the game cache and Steam will restore the content for you!

-Note: You can subscribe to multiple game mods at once

-To help keep your mods straight, or bundle some new art in place into a single collection to effortlessly share with friends.

**Uploading Content to the Workshop**

Those of you who watched the gameplay reveal the other week (Haven't seen it? Check it out on YouTube!) may remember I showed off ""fish farms"" to show easy it is to change some of the farm textures in game. To all of the corn haters out there
Uploading content is designed to be easy!

-From within Age of Empires II: HD Edition

-Hit the appropriately named 'add files' button to open the steam install directory and add any files associated with your game mod. In my fish farm example

-Once you pick any files associated with your workshop entrant, and choose a stunning photo of the mod for the world to see and entice users to subscribe to your file.

-Hit publish and you too could be sending villagers to farm fish!

Make sure to share your custom content with others

**So..what exactly can I modify here?**

It's actually much easier to talk about what you can't change. You can tweak the vast majority of files in Age of Empires II: HD Edition, steam connectivity, video, etc. By default we also protect the main game campaign files, so if you want to create modified campaigns you can, just create your own with different names.

When it comes to the rest of the game content however, art, unit files, and more! Some of the data files are packaged like the original and may take a bit of digging, but other areas (some sprites like fire) are actually easier now to modify. Some existing mods will be trivial to bring to the HD Edition, however in other cases a direct port may not be possible.

We realize that one of the largest reasons the community is still so vibrant around Age of Empires II has to do with the flexibility people have had with the game over the last decade. This is a game for the fans

**What mods can I use with multiplayer games?**

This isn't one that isn't easy to answer, anything that does change the gameplay, you will likely risk experiencing sync issues when attempting to play with other players. Having said that, if you were to come up with an awesome gameplay mod that a ton of people liked and downloaded, anyone with that mod probably would sync just fine together. Fortunately by working through the Steam environment here, you're able to restore the default game at pretty much any time very quickly should you ever wander off into the mod trail and get lost.

Before signing off here, or better yet, suggest the author uploads it themselves. I've seen hundreds, even thousands of hours of work people have put into their creations, and it's crucial to give them the recognition they deserve.
Hopefully this clears up a bit about the workshop. I can't wait to see what everyone comes up with starting April 5th!

1366406014.0,1cp7y1,What to do when you can't compete militarily in a team game,Mind_Killer,55,3,17,"This is going to apply to a very specific group of people. It also won't be perfect. However

So, just because the AoE gods hate you, you're the one getting attacked. You have a decent growing town, but you know you're going to lose. What do you do?

Here are your options in order from least to most helpful, options:

1. You could complain about it over chat. ""Why aren't you guys helping me?"" And ""Do something yellow!"" And ""Sorry I'm not good."" Are all common examples of the least helpful thing you can do. Chances are your teammates know what's happening and are trying to help as best they can

2. Quit. This is actually more helpful to your teammates than just staying in the game and whining. If you quit they don't have to try and save you. They also don't have the added pressure of hearing you complain. In the same vein

Helpful options:

3. Rebuild and try to contribute militarily. If you find yourself being attacked

4. Rebuild and contribute in indirect ways. Since you'll be far more limited toward advancing your units, however, that all this means you're now going to be draining your teammate's resources. 

The Best (and least used) Option:

5. Rebuild and contribute economically. So you're wiped out and basically just draining the few gold and wood reserves your allies have left, feel that the best thing you can and should do is become a resource for your teammates. Since they've got the added pressure of being a man down, they'll also be on the back foot militarily and won't be able to concentrate on their economy macro as much anymore. Given that you probably won't be upgrading your units much anytime soon, and the rest of the game has already proven it can outproduce you, why not feed your allies what they need to succeed? Use the Market the way people rarely do. A regular supply of tribute to keep their military reserves supplied. Create your own super-cart-train and give them the gold. Look at the units your allies are building and try to keep that resource going for them. 

Often it seems like the only time people tribute is when the person doing well is trying to help the defeated get back on their feet. The opposite of that can be way more conducive to a winning formula. In a game where your team is basically fighting 2 versus 3

Turn your weakness into a strength. Instead of being the weak link in the chain

I know there's not a lot of direct information here. Just ideas. Maybe ideas you haven't considered. Maybe ideas you don't give a damn about. I don't know. I just know that I like winning,,False,self,t5_2sg7u,False,,True

WHAT IN THE BLUE FUCK WHERE THEY DOING WITH WILLIAM WALLACE'S TESTICLES AT THE END OF BRAVEHEART!?

Today I'm doing the Celts and what's really weird is that they are the most historically inaccurate civ in the game. Please, the Celts' siege capabilities are greatly exaggerated and to an extent plain made up.

**YO DAWG, BITCH.**

In AoE2, the developers decided to not use the Celts in the Joan of Arc campaign, even though the Scots helped the French during the Hundred Year's War and they could have shown up as an allied force during the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Joan of Arc campaigns and it would have made for a cool transition from the William Wallace campaigns like how Saladin shows up in the Barbarossa campaign and vice versa (well, Barbarossa's forces are mentioned but never make it to the Holy Land).

Taken broadly, which would also probably refer to another Celtic tribe, and also refers to the region today we call France. The Celts and the Gauls inhabited most of continental Europe as well as the British Isles and had conflicts with both the Greeks and the Romans. The Dark Ages could be seen as a drastic shift in power from the Celts, Latins, and Greeks to the Germanic peoples. By the Middle Ages, the people whom we refer to as “Celts” were reduced to Scotland, Ireland, Cornwall

During the Middle Ages the, Angles, etc. settled the area and mixed with the population who would become the English, and furthermore Vikings and Normans came and mixed with them, as well. There is a documented flight of Celtic groups to the British Isles from mainland Europe during the Germanic migration and I'm sure the AoE2 devs wanted the player to be able to create scenarios about Celtic tribes fighting against Germanic tribes in the early Dark Age.

In the Dark Ages, and translated many Latin books and many other peoples came to Ireland to learn. During the Viking Age, many Vikings settled in Ireland and Scotland and intermingled with their Celtic subjects, founding towns and integrating.

Scotland is pretty much defined by getting their asses handed to them by the English time and again. While the English can never quite take Scotland by force for very long
	
The Scots were pretty cool after the Middle Ages for being the first place The Enlightenment started

The Celts are related and fought many battles with the Britons, fought against the Vikings, and allied with the French.

**BONUSES UP IN THIS BITCH**

* Siege Weapons fire +20% faster

Siege is the Celt's main trait and...I don't think this is at all historically accurate. The Celts seem to be very inaccurate. I looked every where, Irish) as using much siege engines, let alone rivaling the Mongols. It would be more accurate if the Celts had no siege weapons! However, given the large number of Infantry civs already in the game, it would be pretty boring if the Celts were purely Infantry like they are in real life. So I feel like the Scots were given stronger Siege Weapons not just to make them different but to have different gameplay from the rest of the civs; at the time, they were the only true Siege civ, with the Turks having higher HP Bombard Cannons and the Mongols having an anti-Siege unit that paved the way for their own, this bonus is not historically accurate

* Infantry move +15% faster

This bonus makes it so that Celtic Infantry is faster than everybody else's Infantry...sort of. Berserks and Huskarls are still really fast and outrun Celtic Champs and are equal in speed to Celtic Halbs. Anyway, and then running away to cover and doing this repeatedly. They would harass their enemies, most specifically the English, and reduce their morale.

*  Lumberjacks chop wood +15% faster

There isn't an exact truth to this tech, buildings, and military units. Europeans cleared large tracts of land for their farms and buildings, so the Teutons, Franks, Vikings, Britons and to an extent the Spanish can exchange their economic bonuses with the Celts and it would make sense. However the Celts have stronger siege weapons so this is a good gameplay bonus and the word “Celt” evokes sort of a forest and nature and shit

* Sheep are not converted if within 1 Celt unit's LoS

This is the economic bonus that is pretty specifically Celtic. The British Isles were famous for their large numbers of Sheep and as a workshop for the wool trade

* TEAM BONUS: Siege Workshops work +20% faster

Another bonus to make the Celts THE Siege civ. I sort of like to think of the Celts as an “alternate British civ, the Wood bonus is somewhat analogous to the Town Center bonus, the Sheep bonuses are analogous, and the Siege and Archery bonuses are somewhat similar in that the Britons fire more shots at their enemy due to their range while the Celtic siege weapons outright fire more often.

Firstly, please.

Now, there are always 8-9 AoC streams on Twitch, as opposed to the rare 1 before HD. Right now, there is 100,811 HD accounts made. Thats quite a number as opposed to the 4,000 before HD. I know a lot a lot don't play MP, but there are quite a few that do. I know most of them are newer and not as experienced, otherwise they would have been on Voobly. So I'm kind of confused as to why some people expected every HD player to be on par with the veterans on Voobly. 

Anyway, and some of you do, but most don't. To get a community growing, you have to be apart of it. You don't even have to stream HD, because there isn't a HD version and regular AoC to choose from on Twitch. Just a couple days ago, some guy streamed and didn't even know farms produced food, it was his first time but he had 200 viewers.

I've started streaming a couple days ago, and so on) (I also know the ratings are kind of useless because some players are arguably better than their rating but it's the fairest way I could come up with). I will be happy to cough up some Amazon gift cards for the prizes and what not (who doesn't like Amazon) Just to get a community thing going. This is the place I thought I'd announce it.

Will AoC become a one community thing (all at Voobly or all at the HD version)? Probably not. But really, I think I heard Viper just got partnered on Twitch, so the viewers are there. 

I really want the community to grow

&gt;Steam should automatically update your game from 2.3 to 2.5. If you have been running the 2.5 beta

&gt;I’ve been jumping between 2.3 and 2.5 quite a bit over the last few days, including a performance improvement aimed squarely at the command lag. This feels like one of the most significant non-beta patches we’ve had since launch and we’re excited to have you check it out!

&gt;Read on for all of the details:

**Full list of Patch Notes (from 2.3)**

&gt;**Tech tree:**
&gt;&gt;* Implementation of unique unit with purple legend entry
&gt;&gt;* Tech tree should show up properly at all scales on both the left and right side. There were several clipping bugs when the window was at a 4:3 aspect ratio.
&gt;&gt;* Scrolling to the left or right in windowed mode should feel right. Before it would only scroll in some cases when you were well outside the window boundaries.
&gt;&gt;* Scrolling should be disabled when you are close to the bottom of the window so it doesn’t interfere with resizing.
&gt;&gt;* Scroll and close buttons are always centered now in any resolution/aspect ratio.

&gt;**Gameplay**
&gt;&gt;**Maximum Selection Size**

&gt;&gt;    * Increased from 40 (2.3) to 60 (2.5). Backed down from 200 in 2.4beta due to aforementioned reasons

&gt;&gt;**Hotkeys** 

&gt;&gt;    * Reverted hotkey changes from 2.3 that caused incorrectly functioning shift + alt control group commands
&gt;&gt;    * You can now hotkey groups 0-9. (An added control group over the original 1-9)
&gt;&gt;    * The hotkey reset button will not scroll the menu to the top of the screen anymore
&gt;&gt;    * Clicking reset hotkeys will restore the key to the default instead of making there be no hotkey for the item.

&gt;**Localization** 
&gt;&gt;* English strings are no longer locked inside language.dll
&gt;&gt;**Steam Stats / Achievements** 
&gt;&gt;* Single Battle Buildings Razed stat and Single Battle Buildings Lost stat was incorrectly using units lost and has been corrected. These stats/achievements will be reset on the official 2.5 release

&gt;**Cheats** 
&gt;&gt;* From 2.3, gold, and stone are now 10,000 instead of 1,000 and should reduce the wear and tear on your ctrl + v keys.

&gt;**Lobby / Quickmatch**
&gt;&gt;* Quickmatch should match players with the closest applicable ELO ratings and should use DM or RM ratings depending on which mode is selected.
&gt;&gt;* You can now adjust the speed of quick match games. It was getting stuck on Normal whenever you readied yourself.
&gt;&gt;* Lobby games are now sorted properly
&gt;&gt;* Regional settings for lobbies will be primarily based on your Steam download region settings
&gt;&gt;* You can filter lobbies and quickmatch by regional settings including: 
&gt;&gt;    * Worldwide Shows everyone on the patch
&gt;&gt;    * Far Within a continent or two roughly.
&gt;&gt;    * Regional Your region and surrounding regions
&gt;&gt;    * Close Only games in the same region as you
&gt;&gt;* Additional information in the lobby browser. Clicking once on a game will display added info including: 
&gt;&gt;    * Names of players in game
&gt;&gt;    * ELO of players in game for the associated gametype
&gt;&gt;    * Indication of whether the game is RM or DM
&gt;&gt;    * Other misc information (i.e. scenario name)
&gt;&gt;* Double click to join a game lobby

&gt;**Performance changes from 2.3** 
&gt;&gt;* Internal frame rate is capped at 60 (from 20).
&gt;&gt;* User interface updates 10 times per second as opposed to once per second. (mini-map
&gt;&gt;* Introduced pixel smooth scrolling over “half-tile” scrolling. You may want to adjust your scrolling speed options if you find it is too slow.
&gt;&gt;* Reduced “Command Lag”. This is new to the final 2.5 build. Previous builds (including 2.5beta) presented an optimized terrain rendering issue any time a building completed construction or a farm was placed. Previously
&gt;&gt;If you encounter any issues with frame rate unlocks, so you may eventually want to remove it later

&gt;**Leaderboards &amp; ELO Ratings**
&gt;&gt;The ELO calculations have been completely rewritten from the live version in 2.3 and follow the old MS Zone calculations. These boards will be reset again at the go-live for 2.5. Here are the known rules 

&gt;&gt;* Leaderboard ELO calculations are only considered for games that contain exactly two teams and no AI players. Any other combinations of teams are not considered for ELO calculations

&gt;&gt;    * There are two separate ranked leaderboards which encompass the following: 
&gt;&gt;    * Deathmatch games will be ranked on the DM leaderboard.
&gt;&gt;    * Random Map, Regicide, Defend the Wonder, and Wonder Race are part of the RM leaderboard.
&gt;&gt;    * Any other mode will not be considered for ELO score calculations and is unranked

&gt;&gt;* There is a minimum time that a ranked game requires before the game will be officially calculated on the leaderboard. 2 minutes for DM and 5 minutes for RM. Games under those time limits are considered pre-maturely completed and are not scored.

&gt;&gt;* A pre-game penalty is deducted for starting any ranked match. The 3 points is refunded back at the end of the game whether you win, or quit, irregardless of the time limits for determining whether an
&gt;&gt;ELO calculation kicks in (5 minutes RM

&gt;&gt;* Any MP game that is saved and restored later will be considered an unranked game to avoid exploitation.
&gt;&gt;We are now tracking additional stats per leaderboard that will detect players that exploit disconnections. This information is accessible now to 3rd party websites

&gt;**Crash Fixes**

&gt;&gt;* We have fixed a random crash affecting Windows XP users involving issuing move orders – which could cause games to occasionally crash during gameplay.

&gt;**Known Issues**

&gt;&gt;* It is **highly recommended** when moving to the beta build (or when upgrading between builds) to create a new player profile to avoid any potential conflicts during the upgrade. You can do so within the game by going to options

&gt;&gt;* If you do a fresh install of AOE II HD after having the game on your system

&gt;&gt;* We are tracking several rare crashes across multiple versions on windows XP during campaign play and will continue to investigate to improve stability.

&gt;&gt;* For some players the steam overlay may present a significant framerate drop when visible. We’re looking into this

&gt;&gt;* Please ensure you are using a copy legitimately purchased through official retail channels (Amazon, etc) and downloaded through Steam when attempting to play AOE II HD. We cannot support issues that may crop up with other versions.",AoC HD,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1374264467.0,Blank,

I am a scenario maker that have made a lot of multiplayer scenarios for Age of Empires 2: The Conquerors. After playing this new HD Edition for a few hours and playing some custom scenarios that were made for the old 1.0c game

When using the invisible object trick by changing the unit frame in Trigger Studio to 4294936223 (http://i.imgur.com/0mxmiyD.png) the object became invisible in the old 1.0c version of the game, like this: http://i.imgur.com/1q8iHp3.png. In this case, the unit is meant to kick another player from the game if deleted. If the object is invisible, only player 1 can select it by pressing the idle military button. So when player 1 resigns, his allies will not be able to delete the unit. In HD Edition, the objects are only randomly invisible, but mostly they are not, the other players can kick each others.

Shoreless water data has been changed so the blending of the terrains around it is completely different from the old 1.0c version of the game. This is how it looks like in the old 1.0c game: http://i.imgur.com/fB3NTz3.jpg, the shoreless water lacks the water animation that the other new water terrains has. Some more examples where the blending looks weird, here making it look like you can walk around the obstacles, but you can't:

Invincible units with 0HP is also a well-known trick used in many scenarios, for example in CBAv9 it is used on a king as a kill-counter. Here's how it looks in HD Edition: http://i.imgur.com/iLKs1eK.png, while it should look like this like it does in 1.0c: http://i.imgur.com/ZoFas5S.png.

Farm terrains have changed too much, and how it looks in the HD Edition: http://i.imgur.com/3iVTPBt.jpg.

Some other bugs that I've found and should be looked at:

When tabbing out of the scenario editor of the HD Edition causes the cursor to disappear. Cursor is really small when holding the mouse over a resource to task a villager to gather. And taking mapshots results in a black .bmp with only the relics visible and screenshots resulting in only the UI visible and the ""game"" itself is black.

Buildings are visible through fog of war as shown here:

HOW TO SET UP:
Go to scenario editor, you'll have a normal islands game.

However

Now, focused boom and defend going on in their island with most resources consumed. Although you could invade earlier, it kinda defeats the purpose and removes any challenge - you'll just be rushing like usual, but without the threat of retaliation.


I've played this game type twice, even with your 'Island Advantage'. The last match took us almost 6 hours spread over a couple of days.

If anyone tries this

AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW GOTH DAMN

SHIT MORE OFTEN


**GOTH DAMN GOTHERFUCKER

The Goths of AoE2 specifically represent a group of Germanic peoples who migrated into Roman Europe around the beginning of the 3rd century. However, Lombards, Alamanni, Gepids, etc. In AoE2, you first see the Goths filling in for Slavic tribes; you encounter the Goths as the ""Russians"" in the 4th Ghengis Khan scenario, then the Goths as the Poles in the 5th scenario. In the Barbarossa campaign, who are represented Goths, the developers wanted to include the Slavs but felt that the gameplay ideas that they had for an Infantry flood civilization suited the Goths more.

As I've pointed out before in these, and lacking the language of their opponents, they would refer to them as Cavaliers. So too with the Goths, except the Goths are viewed from the perspective of the Latin peoples of the Roman Empire.

We know the Goths migrated out of somewhere in Southern Sweden or so, Danish, Saxons, and other early Germanic peoples. They settled in present-day Poland, Ukraine, and Russia and were recruited by the Romans into their army as auxillaries. In fact, many Goths fought against the Persians in the Roman wars with them. The Goths were then pushed into Roman lands by the invading Huns

The Goths had split into groups led by the Tervingi and the Greuthungi. The Tervingi called themselves ""Vesi, as you can tell by their name, were mostly active in the Eastern part of Europe, although they did end up in many parts of Western Europe and the Visigoths were active around western Europe, though they were all over the place, as well. These two groups had their own succession of Kings and they fought each other constantly. The Visigoths often found a bit more favor with the Romans, having been ""given"" Spain (the Romans asked for their help in taking it from other Germanic tribes but the Goths were basically independant) while the Ostrogoths and Romans were pretty much at each other's throats for ever.

The Romans and Goths had numerous battles, and Ostrogoths all managed to reach Rome and attack it, quickly raiding, entering, and raiding the city. For a while, most of the old Roman possessions were held by these Germanic tribes; the Visigoths had Spain and parts of France, the Ostrogoths had Italy, and the Franks in present-day France.

The Italian Gothic kingdom was invaded by the Byzantines under Justinian, the Lombards. The Vandal Kingdom was reconquered by Justinian, as well, but fell later to the Arabs. The Visigothic kingdom in Spain actually managed to stay standing well into the Middle Ages timeframe. Most of Spain was conquered by the Arabs, Moors, and Berbers and the Gothic Kingdom of Asturias was left in the North by the 8th century. It was a very Latinized kingdom, however,"" to bring Latin culture such as Catholicism

A group of Goths living in Crimea (a peninsula in the Black Sea, Byzantines, Tatars, and Slavs.

The Goths occasionally fought with and was incorporated into the Hunnic and Byzantine Empires, as well, and if we were to expand the idea of the Goths in AoE2 to mean most of the semi-nomadic Germanic tribes during the migration period, then it was the ""Goths"" who invaded the British Isles, fighting with the Celts and each other. The Goths are related to the Vikings, and the Mongols, Turks, as well.

**THESE BONUSES BE SO BLACK THEY GOTHIC**

* Infantry cost -25% starting in Feudal Age

This bonus is the starting point to the Goths' entire playstyle, overwhelming their enemies. They are the Zergs of AoE2 and if you took AoE2 as pure, unadulterated history, you'd think that the Goths were the historical Zergs of the world. They actually were not, very far from it. The semi-nomadic lifestyle of many peoples in the worlds does not lend well to huge populations. The urban societies such as the Romans and Chinese had the biggest populations because they had stable food source, and also had the time and energy to invest in stuff like medicine. Historically, the Goths never had a numbers advantage, depending on the battle they would have the numbers advantage). The Romans in particular almost always outnumbered them. HOWEVER, and we know that the Romans frequently played with numbers. Funnily enough, the second interpreation

1357106597.0,15t9j1,A Few Non-Balance Suggestions For the FE Team,TheBattler,47,6,19,"I've got a few flavour and setting suggestions for a 1.1 release.

**Hun Building Set to Slavic Set**

1 - Look at the Slavic building set and tell me that it wouldn't fit the Huns really well

2 - The ""heartlands"" of the Hunnic Empire was the part of the world where the Slavs lived: present-day Poland, Slovakia, Ukraine.

3 - Even today there are many Turkic tribes living in European Russia. The Huns disappeared from Europe completely after the 6th century but their cousins did not. After they were gone Europe was invaded by the Bulgars and Avars, Kipchaks, Kazakhs, and Cossacks (sort of Turkic) all stayed around European Russia well into the ""Imperial Age."" Making their building set similar to the Slavs would imply a continuity between the Huns and those people who neighbored the Slavs.

**Spanish and Byzantine Set Into Italian Set**

1 - The Western European set is based on England's architecture. It doesn't make much sense for the Spanish.

2 - In a similar vein

3 - The Spanish would make more sense with the Italian architecture set

4 - Obviously, the Italian set looks similar to the Saracen one so you could finally infer that the Saracens imitated the Byzantines. Byzantine Churches look vaguely more like the Mosques than they do the Italian Churches but that's a price to pay for having the overall look more accurate.

**Indian Set**

Nobody's expecting you to make everything perfect in one go

However that Indian set is not 100% complete yet and I don't think the author will complete it. So it will take alot of time for your graphics guys to finish it: with the Huns and Spanish thing

With that done...

**Adding New Stuff In the Future**

I originally had wrote a bit suggesting a new civ but I realize that's kind of stupid.

What I really want to know is the possibility of adding to the expansion.

I remember reading apost on aokheaven's forums a long time ago from an Ensemble Studios dev and he implied that there's a limited amount of room for extra civs and map editor units. Is that true?

FE didn't add a far eastern civ

**Renaming Unique Techs**


* Celtic UT: Strongholds -&gt; Turtithe

Furor Celtica is Latin and the Celts need a Tech in Gaelic! Turtithe means ""Tower Houses

* Mayan UT: Tlatoani -&gt; Tal Ka'ak Tumen Pa

Tlatoani is the Nahuatl word for their ruler. The Mayans are definitely not a Nahua people. My lack of knowledge of Mayan grammar notwithstanding

* Italian UT: Silk Road -&gt; Monopolio

This implies the strength of the Italian UT more than simply ""Silk Road."" The Italians had a near monopoly on the spice trade from the Silk Road for centuries and the fact that Silk Road reduces their Trade Carts to 50% cost implies their practice of wildly inflating the price of their goods when they sell them back to the other European because of their Monopoly. Furthermore

* Teutons UT: Ironclads -&gt; Wagenburg

The Bohemians would use Wagons to as mobile fortifications and would frequently put artillery in these Wagons for protection. See where I'm going with this? The Teutons called them Wagenburg. Since we're never going to get Slavic War Wagons and the Bohemians seem to be considered Teutons (their descendants are the Czechs and Slovaks, just not in the Castle Age where this tech is available. Also, ""Ironclad"" is almost universally used to refer to ships. :-\

* Mongol UT: Nomads -&gt; Yurts

I think with the Hun bonus

* Viking UT: Chieftains -&gt; Shield Wall

Chieftains doesn't really make much sense. Shield Wall is one of the few documented Viking tactics used to combat cavalry.

* Hun UT: Marauders -&gt; Ataxia

Ataxia sort of means ""chaos"" and usually refers to a medical condition where one suffers from involuntary muscle twitches. I chose this name because it's sort of a synonym of Anarchy, which refers to blood being delivered to a capillary bed.

An Ayllo is an Andean Sling.

* Magyar UT: Recurve Bow -&gt; Saggittis Hungarorum

I'M KINDA SNAKIN' ALONG HISTORY YA HEARD AND I DO WHAT I WANT VILLA!! SO WE GON' GO BACKWARDS FROM WHERE WE CAME VILLA

YEH YEH

**EYYYY VILLA

The Korean civ in AoE2 is most likely based off of the Joseon Dynasty of 1392-1897.

The Gojoseon are in Age of Empires 1 spelled as Choson (Joseon). The earliest medieval Korean state is the Goguryeo dynasty of 37 BC to 668 CE. The Goryeo Dynasty ruled most of Korea from 918 to 1392

Before the Goryeo unification of the peninsula, Wang Geon, in turn conquered the Silla. To end the Middle Ages a rebel General took control of Korea to establish the Joseon Dynasty.

The polities of the Korean peninsula had to frequently deal with the Chinese and the semi-nomadic peoples such as the Mongols, only to fail.

Korea has also had an interesting relationship to Japan; the Baekje Dynasty were close allies of the Yamato and when they lost their territories to the Silla

The Koreans borrowed heavily from Chinese culture and transmitted it to Japan

**ANYONG HASEYO KOREAN BONUSEs BITCH**

* Villagers +3 LoS

If you look at it at face value, it's obvious the devs wanted to give the Koreans a more general economic bonus because the Stone Miner one is not very useful to any civ's economy. The Stone Mining bonus allows for easier flush protection in the Feudal Age and maybe faster additional Town Centerss in Castle but that's about it. I will describe it's use in gameplay and from there we get hints to it's historical basis. First and foremost, it allows your Villagers to find resources earlier especially when you first start and they're standing around your Town Center. Like the Chinese, the Korean states were strong in the timeframe of the European Dark Age and this bonus allows you to get a small head start on your opponents by allowing you to find sheep and berries before they do. It allows you to see enemies coming from just over the stretch of forest they're chopping down. Because they had to deal with incursions from around Mongolia, from China, and occasionally from Japan, the Koreans built many forts around their cities and borders to allow them warning of attack. The Goguryeo employed lots of scouts and spies to gather intel for them. With that said

* Stone Miners work +20% faster

The Chinese and Koreans were master fortifiers

* Towers +1/2 range starting in Castle Age

If you think about it, from China, and from nomads. They managed to survive somehow, and [the huge number of](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castles_in_Korea) forts and walls in Korea point to them surviving on defenses. Korean towers weren't especially notable and to be honest none of the civs in the game had especially ""notable"" towers. HOWEVER, the Koreans were an archery civilization much like their neighbors and you can imagine the archers who happen to be permanently stationed at Korean towers firing at anything that comes within 8+1 range were more skilled than Chinese or German archers because they relied so heavily on towers.

* Tower upgrades free; Bombard Tower requires Chemistry first

Another fortification related bonus. The Koreans possess a continuous civilization and probably innovated lots of fortification techniques long before most of the other civs in AoE2. The fact that the Koreans need to research Chemistry is not a result of this tidbit of history I'm about to tell

* TEAM BONUS: Mangonel line +1 range

I'm kind of excited to do the Mayans right now because they (along with the Aztecs) are so distinctly different from the rest of the civs in game

**WHATCHU KNOW ABOUT THEM MAYANS

The Mayans of AoE2 represent the historical Mayans who existed any where from 3114 BC (the beginning of the Mayan calendar) to the first recognizeably Mayan settlements in 1800 BC. In AoE, which is the nexus of Mayan civilization.

Unlike many of the civs in AoE, Persians, Byzantines, and Arabs were meticulous record keepers, and the Europeans would would become very good about it, as well. In contrast, they are fairly mysterious to history

What we do know is that there were many Mayan cities and towns, and trade between them. The Spanish ended up burning many of the Mayan writings, and some others have not survived time. Most of what we know about the Mayans come from inscriptions on stone.

I'm not particularly knowledgeable about the Mayans' history. Each city had their own line of rulers and it's own history and no centralized government ever united all the Maya peoples. It's easy to talk about the Holy Roman Empire or the Abbasid Caliphate, and the Post-Clasic from 900 until the 1500s when the Spanish arrived. The Mayan civilization in the Yucatan peninsual collapsed around the 900s, and there is evidence of droughts, famine, warfare population centers leaving, and migration out of Yucatan, though no one is certain what happened. Mayan settlements outside of the peninsual survived continuously

It's thought that the Mayans were contemporaries of the Olmecs

Certain Maya peoples fought with and traded with the Aztecs and were conquered by the Spanish. Fun fact

**MAYAN BONUSES**

* Start with Eagle Warrior instead of Scout Cavalry

The Mayan and Aztec civilizations have one, so they're not unique). Horses were in the Americas for sometime, but in the very distant past about 8000 BC. They were probably hunted to extinction by the ancestors of the Native Americans. Due to the lack of a strong draft animal, the Mesoamerican peoples (and in turn, many Native Americans) were fairly isolated and their governed territories were quite small. Compare this to Central Asia where horses were first domesticated, you had various peoples in contact and confederation over massive swaths of land. The Mayans and Aztecs had the wheel, but they didn't have much of a use for it due to a lack of strong draft animals. I don't know if the Incas used Llamas and the wheel, although the Eagle Warrior is actually an Aztec specific class of warriors, but the Eagle makes up for it's lack of speed (as well as it's cost of gold as opposed to the Hussar's cost of food) and HP in comparison with high pierce armor and a great attack bonus versus Siege weapons. It also has an attack bonus versus Cavalry, they can even beat Mamelukes but that depends on micro.

* Start with +1 Villager

The high point of Mayan civilization, which is completely before and after the Dark Age. So the Mayans get a small bonus to reflect that. I don't have too much else to say, really. During the Classical Period, Mayan population was in the millions, but it wasn't very notable unlike the Song Dynasty population.

* Resources last 20% longer

A weird but awesome bonus in game and not historical at all. But I'm going to analyze it and I have a pretty good idea about it. The Aztecs are given a similarly general bonus (Villagers carry +5), which really hurts them in the Castle Age and arguably the Feudal Age. The Mayan one in particular is interesting from a historical standpoint because of the pop culture description of a Native American. If you live in America and you think of a Native American, you get a variety of ideas and pictures associate with them. The industrial and imperial Europeans taking the land away from the nature loving and peaceful Natives. The genocide of the Native peoples, as well as the destruction of their environment paints the picture of a ""noble savage,"" living with the ecology in harmony. But if you really dig deeper, you'll realize that no matter who they are, the Iroqouis, the Aztecs, so the developers made the Mayans very defense-oriented (they planned for the Maya to be defensive, totally different. Many past archaeologists

* Archers

There isn't really much evidence for the Maya having used lots of Archers. Mesoamerican archery tech was pretty terrible compared to the rest of the world; they didn't have a big animal with strong bones like the West Asians did to make their Composite bows. They didn't have iron-tipped arrows because iron is hard to maintain in that part of the world. The Maya and Aztecs, their missile tech was just as good as Bows or Crossbows or Cannons of the world. The Spanish dreaded the simple Atlatl the most out of any weapon in the native arsenal. The Atlatl was a shaft with a cup to hold the projectile, and the shaft would act as an extension of the arm, held by the hand. Imagine the centrigual force generated by a yo-yo or a nunchuk, now transfer that into a projectile. That's basically how the atlatl worked. The atlatl threw ""darts,"" that were not quite small enough to be arrows, not quite long enough to be javelins. These darts would go straight through Spanish armor, especially at mid range, but the Maya get a bonus to their decidedly defensive Archers as opposed to the offensive Infantry of the Aztecs. If the game were a bit more historical

* TEAM BONUS: Walls cost -50%

A real obvious defensive bonus. Although most of the Mayan cities do not have defensive walls that stand to this day, gates, and towers. The Maya were excellent stone workers, and so this bonus makes even more sense.",,False,self,1342651009.0,t3_qvfbd

I KNOW

WELCOME TO ANOTHER DAY HISTORY VS ANALYSIS GAMEPLAY CIV 6: TURKS THE

**YER A TURK TURK TURK TURK TURK TURK TURK TURK**

The Turks in AoE2 represent the Seljuq and Ottoman Empires. In the single-player campaign, they are used as a Mongolic tribe in the first Ghengis Khan scenario, as the Sultanate of Rum in the Battles of the Conquerors Manzikert scenario, the Ottoman Empire in the Lepanto scenario, and as stand-ins for the Berbers in the Battle of Tours scenario as well as for an El Cid scenario.

Those peoples who identify themselves as Turkic span a very long group of people originating from the Steppes of Asia. They are related to the Mongols ethnically and linguistically, Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. The suffix ""-stan"" is also used for Afghanistan, Pakistan, and to refer to India as ""Hindustan."" It's a Persian suffix for ""place of."" Tajikistan is another similar country, Afghanistan, and the Magyars (Hungarians) are genetically related to the Turkic peoples, and then nearly a thousand (more like 900) years later

The first Turkic peoples were living in and around China and the Central Asian Steppes. They of course were horse people similar to how I described the Mongols in the last edition. The first Turkic state was that of the Xiognu Confederation,"" and if you watched Mulan, you'd realize that it's the same title as the main villain, Shan Yu, master of the Huns. The next polity to emerge was that of the Gokturks, and by then the Chinese were calling them ""Tue Jue"" and occasionally ""Turuk."" Gok or ""Koku"" means ""Celestial,"" and the Chinese would often add majestic sounding words to their names for important political rivals and allies.

The Gokturks were disbanded in the same way the Xiognu were; internal conflict because they were a bunch of nomadic tribes who insisted on having separate identities. Afterward

The Turks who migrated to Persia and Arabia were usually used as soldiers, the Arabs were the priests, the Persians the bureaucrats, and the Turks the generals. The Seljuq took over the Abbasid Empire for a while and held Anatolia (present day Turkey) for about 300 years, calling it Rum (Rome). The Mongol Empire attacked this area, and the Turks were divided into the Cairo Mamluk Sultanate and the Sultanate of Rum. Eventually the Ottomans would take control from the Mongols and Mamluks to close out the Middle Ages.

The Turks are related to the Mongols and Huns, for, and took on the characteristics of the Persians, Saracens, and Byzantines, and they fought many European civilizations during the Crusades.

**TURKISH BONUSES!? I KNOW**

* Gunpowder units +25% HPs

The Ottoman Turks were obviously not the first to use gunpowder; the Chinese were. The Koreans used gunpowder way before them. The Mongols and Europeans used gupowder before the Turks. But it's the Ottomans who created an empire with a huge emphasis on artillery. The Chinese mostly fought peoples whom they could consider to be Chinese, but their naval power and their ridiculously large cannons used during the siege of Constantinople. The Dardanelles Gun is an example of the super-sized cannons used during the siege. The Turkish Navy, armed with cannons, dominated the Mediterranean for a century until the Battle of Lepanto (they were still pretty good, just not dominant). The extra HP to the Janissary and Hand Cannoneers could be seen as a part of the Turks' zeal. The Turks were powerful soldiers and seen contemporaneously and historically as more zealous than the Persian and Saracens. It's easy to imagine the ""fanatical"" Turkish Jannisaries still fighting in spite of a few bullet wounds to teh chset.

* Gunpowder techs cost -50% to research

The devs were intent on making the Turks the gunpowder civ

* Gold Miners work +15% faster

The Turks didn't actually have prolific mining operations, from the trade itself and from being their de facto administrators. This bonus is also the only other trade bonus aside from the Spanish and Saracen ones. The Market is used because it is faster than sending Villies to gather resources. By making the central resource of the Market quicker to gather, it makes buying certain resources faster than actually having Villagers gather that resource. You can instead have 5 Villagers mine gold rather than chop wood and, for a few buys, it's more efficient to buy the Wood. As far as the Market goes, this is not so dramatic and strong as the Saracen bonus but it's still considerable. And this bonus is better than the Saracen one in general, anyway.

* Chemistry free

Again, and Byzantines, the Turks were a nomadic civilization. They quickly adapted and rose to the top of those societies. You can sort of infer that all of the Turks bonuses are geared towards this idea. The Gold Bonus means you have an advantage when going towards the Castle Age (200 gold), as well as advancing to the Imperial Age (800 gold). The free Chemistry means you get Bombard Cannons available immediately. The Gunpowder techs being -50% means you can research Cannon Galleons and Bombard Towers quickly. This is also related to the next bonus; you can have an army of Elite Janissaries, Bombard Cannons, and Hussars out faster than anybody else can.

* Light Cavalry

This is the Turks' most historically accurate bonus. They were among the many horse tribes in the Central Asian steppes, highlighting their religious zeal.

* TEAM BONUS: Gunpowder units trained +20% faster

Example 2:
I see often on gameranger people putting a 50NR 35NR, build as fast as you can, and pump as many troops as you can, wich is just stupid it's no more a strategy game, and I think it's due to the 200 pop limit cuz with a 75 you can't just rush easily, because having too much troops in the feudal age means that you don't have many workers which means that if your rush is crushed you'll probably lose when your opponent reaches the castle age, and it also forces people to scout often because you can't just sit tight and wait till imperial

FOUR-WAY MEGATRON YEAH!!!!

YO DWAG IZ YA BOI, I DID THE SARACENS THE DAY BEFO, NOW I DO JAPANESE TODAY TO MAKE UP FOR MY DRY SPELL RECENTLY.

**I WONDER IF YOU KNOW HISTORY OF TOKYO

The Japanese in Aoe2 represent...the Japanese. There's only two scenarios with the Japanese, there are only 3 instances when the Japanese fought a foreign power!The Japanese are in AoE2 partly because Japan is around today, a culture with immense longevity starting in ancient times (they were in the first AoE as the Yamato). However the main reason for the Japanese is because of their lack of real-life conflict in medieval times. You never got to see a Samurai army versus, say, European Knights in real life due to geography. It's a bit of a dream match that is possible in AoE2 and in pretty much every strategy game with medieval warfare.

In 663 the Korean state of Baekje fell to the rival state of Silla, non-Japanese and is even more interesting because this was before the Samurai culture and well-developed warfare techniques. The Silla had apparently staged a minor invasion or raid of Japan in 14 AD followed by a Japanese retaliation, and a Japanese empress was said to have invaded Korea and conquered parts of it. I say apparently because records of are scant.

Fast forward to 1274 and Mongols under Kublai Khan had finally conquered China and Korea, and withdrew for fear of a storm. The Mongols would try again in 1281 but the first conflict profoundly affected the Japanese. They built many coastal defenses that frustrated a landing of the Mongol fleet. In the haste to produce an invasion force, the Koreans and Chinese hired to build the ships made boats more suited to river fighting. As Japanese Monks prayed for deliverance, a huge storm known today as the Kamikaze (the divine wind) wiped out the Mongol fleet before they could land.

Finally in 1592 Hideyoshi invaded Korea. This conflict, which most of us played in Age of Empires 2. Japan was defeated and cut itself off from the rest of the world for 250 years.

Japanese pirates had been raiding China on and off for centuries

Japan had intermittent cycles of civil war and peace, presiding over a gaggle of small independent territories. These territories were theoretically just rented to nobles by the Emperor but since there was usually no Imperial Army, this was true Feudalism and the nobles owned their land. Japan was like Europe, except in Asia.

Japan takes alot of cultural cues from the Chinese, as well. There was always trade between Japan and China since ancient times.

Japan has been linked to Korea and China for thousands of years, Japan has been quite isolationist.

**THE JAPANESE LOVE TO FISH AND SHIT

* Fishing Ships 2x HP (+60)

The Japanese had a sea-reliant civilization. Obviously they originally got to Japan by the sea

* Mill

I'm not really sure where this bonus comes. HOWEVER Japan is a bunch of volcanic islands

* Infantry attack +25% faster starting in Feudal Age (+10/15/25 in 1.0c patch)

AoE is a eurocentric game and there persists a myth that the Japanese were peerless swordsmen wielding the best swords in the world. I would say that not only were the Japanese historically more reliant the bow and spear than the sword like everybody else, in the time it takes an Aztec Halb to get 4 strikes in (for 164 damage), a Japanese one will have gotten 5 in (185). Japanese Swordsmen also beat Aztec Swordsmen, and Aztec Swordsmen only get +4 Attack in the Imperial Age. Samurai also made use of pole weapons such as the Naginata and the Nagamaki, especially against cavalry, before widespread use of the sword.

* TEAM BONUS: Galleys +50% LoS

Japanese seamen had thousands of years of experience and it makes sense that they'd be able to see very far and wide. If I designed this game I'd switch the Viking and Japanese Team Bonuses for history's sake, or even Chinese seamen during the medieval period.

I've got a cool idea for a map

So Team Islands is a fairly well known map

Assume (for now) that there are two teams and equal number of players per team.

Each player of one team gets matched up on an island with each player of another team. Thus there would be n/2 main islands for n players. Gameplay, so you have to beat your matched up opponent first. This would lead to tournament-style dynamics, which I think would be really interesting.

Regarding the two team, *then some island gets 3*, no islands with one. If one team has more players, we can do multiple pairings, with the constraint that no island has less than 2 people.

Anyway, and I don't know if this is possible, it would be randomly-generated like one of the built in maps (black forest, team islands, etc.) so players can't adapt to a static map. Can anyone build this?

What would you change about the game or add? What WOULDN'T you change?

I'm all about streamlining the experience.

I would cut down the number of Ages to Dark-Feudal-Imperial. The new Dark Age would be more like the Feudal Age

The current Dark Age gameplay is repetitive and one-minded and I know that it originally started off as a way to make it easier for new players to play but you don't even have to be that good to get the Dark Age ""build"" down. I think that the game should start you off with a Town Center, remove the minimum range for towers and make Murder Holes a non-issue, so that it's easier to turtle in the Dark Age. Or maybe instead give the player enough stone for 2 towers early on.

The game also needs to be fun and dynamic at all times and also be fun to watch. So

I'm also not a fan of ""trash wars, and Hussars. I think that it's way more fun if the players get to use their cool, fully upgraded units in Imperial Age the entire game.

I'd sort of take a page from AoE3 and make Markets and Monasteries slowly produce gold for you, much less gold from using your own Markets as using another player's Market and you'd have to really build a Market far away for it to be worthwhile. You could increase the gold you make by placing Markets in between; the Trade Carts would obviously take more time having to stop at more Markets but you'd make more gold as a result. This would also force the player to defend his trade routes. Gold mines would be the fastest way to make gold, however.

I'd like to make Sheep, just not gold.

Actually stone isn't so much so. Maybe the game would be fine if Stone Mines held more Stone or maybe you could salvage Stone from enemy structures. You destroy the enemy Castle and then you can then send Villagers to gather, much longer than just pushing Delete) in exchange for his resources back based on how much HP the defensive structure had. 

The civilizations themselves could use a few tweaks. I don't think a few of them were quite accurate,,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1345668355.0,,True

Apparently someone decided it would be a great idea to play a fog-of-war game with all technologies and high resources. Okay

So I go castle in less than twenty minutes and hit twenty knights somewhere between Mister Green Player bowing out due to lag and Mister Blue Player quitting because his ally sent a few military dudes through his base. So now Yellow and Red are alone on the map against me, and Purple. We're pretty overwhelmingly going to wash them, right?

No.

I send my knights down to cut out the weak link

Following that, probably a good two or three thousand points under my score. I wipe both of his town centers, destroy his food villagers, massacre most of his gold and wood villagers, and finally lose my 20 knights and ~10 camels to pikemen and cavalry archers.

At this time

This is also what I was wondering. They are nowhere to be seen. So

So Yellow is basically down and out now, he doesn't have enough stone to build a new town center. I don't have siege stuff.

Yada yada yada, but with much smaller forces, mainly just harassing the AI-stasis resigned Red, Green, and Blue players. Yellow is the only enemy still counted as playing, and I think he's frustrated, because he keeps his fellas wandering around like insidious bastards.

I'm still in Castle Age. This is frustrating because I don't have a fuckton of gold

Finally, I'm lingering around the end of quadruple. There are Teal, Purple, and Orange military units standing around doing jack-all everywhere on the map.

Game ends. GG Yellow

**HISTORY LONGER THAN SARACEN HAIR**

The word ""Saracen"" was originally used by a few Roman historians during the height of the Roman Empire to describe either all Arab peoples, the Byzantine Empire and Armenia: the Turks, Persians, Berbers, Moors, and Arabs. The Saracens in AoE2 represent several historical civilizations, but especially the Abbasid Caliphate that ruled from Baghdad. 

The Saracens are also used to represent the Umayyad Caliphate that invaded Spain and France, and most prominently, the Ayyubid Dynasty founded by Saladin. So the Saracens are pretty much the Arabs.

The Arabs are a Semitic people, Akkad, Judea and Israel, and Yemen. Other related, but not quite Semitic, languages are spoken by the Berbers and Ethiopians. Arabic is related to Aramaic, which was the major trade language spoken by the peoples of the Levant. In the Bible and the Qur'an, Isaac and Ishmael

Around the 7th century the Arabs began to expand out from the Arabian Peninsula, with the Caliphate of Cordoba in Spain and Fatimid Caliphate in Egypt declaring independance from the Abbasid Empire. The rest of the Abbasid Empire would be divided into mostly independent kingdoms who swore nominal fealty to the Abbasids. The Turks were the real masters of the Abbasid Empire from 1016 until about 1256 when the Mongols came along.

Arab political power went into serious decline after the Mongol Conquest. The Mongols ruled the Ilkhanate that included most of modern day Afghanistan, and Syria. The Armenians peacefully submitted to Mongol rule, and they even attempted to forge an alliance between the Mongols and Crusaders against the Muslim powers. The other major political power in the Middle East was the Mameluke Dynasty led by the Turkic Mamelukes. Eventually it was the Turkish Ottoman Empire that became the premier Empire of the Middle East, along with the Persian Safavid Empire.

When the Saracens conquered the Byzantines and Persians, copying their art and architecture, and assimilating their administrative rules. For a time, the Arabs were the priests, the Persians the bureaucrats, and the Turks the soldiers.

The Saracens fought a wide variety of enemies, Franks, Teutons, and Celts during the Crusades, they fought the Goths and Spanish in Spain, they fought the Vikings on rare occasion (especially the Normans), they fought against the Byzantines, and Turks, and the Huns

**WHAT'S INSECT MY SCARAB? WHAT'S FISH MY BEAR CUB? WHAT'S BONUS MY ARAB?**

* Market trade is 5%

The Saracen's only economic bonus is one few understand well. Early on in the game Markets allow you to convert gold and wood, which is very slow to gather from Farms. The Market is more flexible than that but early game it's much faster to push a couple buttons than wait for a Villager to dick around on his Farm. For the Saracens this becomes very, very, very efficient. The Trade bonus is very accurate to history because the Saracens were adept traders. They had the best geographical position out of any contemporary civilization; the Arab Empires straddled 3 continents by land and sea trade routes. From Egypt and Syria, they could reach Europe. From Persia into Turkestan and China. From Southern Arabia they could hit up Africa and India. They were the best merchants in the medieval world, linking the world together, and they fought myriad opponents to keep their supremacy.

* Galleys attack speed +20%

The medieval Arabs were a very naval civilization; obviously they need ships to get to the places I mentioned in the last paragraph! They had numerous naval engagements in the Mediterranean. In their battles against the Byzantines/Romans, Sicily, Malta, Sardinia, North Africa, and Spain. The Arabs had gained control of Sicily, Sardinia, and it makes sense in history; the Arabs conquered land pretty quickly but had a hard time in keeping their gained territories against the Normans

* Transport Ships Carry 2x (actually +5)

They especially traded in the Indian Ocean and notably they spread Islam quite far from Arabia, and Phillippines having arrived in those places by sea. So it makes sense that their Transport Ships would carry more. The Arabs were notable settlers, and settled further areas than even the Vikings. This is an offensive bonus because you can put a few more soldiers on a ship and get them to your enemies. They attacked other lands by sea, and obviously had to land soldiers on their new territories.

* Cavalry Archers +3 attack vs buildings

I'm not entirely sure what to make of this bonus, making quick raids into enemy territory, taking as much booty (GAWD DAMN SHAWWWTY) back to their own territories in order to assess how profitable the enemy settlements for conquering. So you get Cavalry Archers rushing into enemy territory, killing Villies, destroying Lumber Camps and Mining Camps and Houses (slightly) faster than other Cav Archers, and then quickly retreating and frustrating enemy forces by hitting and running.

* TEAM BONUS: Foot Archers +1 Attack vs buildings

I'm not sure what to make of this bonus, either. Saracen Hand Cannoneers are better at demolishing buildings than other Cannoneers (except Spanish ones), so uh, yeah.

So we get a range-heavy civ with a penchant for raiding on both land and sea. And of course,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1355801137.0,,Blank,t3_s3axl

**HEY KID! I'M A COMPUTAH! STOP ALL THE DOWNLOADIN'! READ THE WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE!**

The Britons in AoE2 obviously represent the Kingdom of England, some of whom still occupy it to this day (the Scots, Irish, and Welsh all have celtic cultures and languages). Next came the Roman Empire, who began multiple invasions of the islands starting with Julius Caesar's first invasion in 55 BC. The Romans managed to conquer much of Britain by 410 AD, but the islands were so far away from Rome both in a sense of distance and in a sense of the natural geography in between that it was hard to keep them stabilized and Roman. Caesar had originally justified his invasion by claiming that the Britons (a Celtic people) had aided the Gauls during his wars in Gaul (present-day France). After the Romans withdrew out of Britain, waves of Germanic tribes migrated into Britain and settled it, Jutes, which is why we refer to these inhabitants as Anglo-Saxon. Later on

Great Britain is thus a cauldron of Germanic, and Scandinavian influences.

Obviously, the British Empire. Only the British Empire had colonies, protectorates, territories, and spheres of influences in every continent in every major part of the world. But that's for Age of Empires 3.

The Britons of Age of Empires 2 find their origins in an England divided by Germanic invaders and original Celtic inhabitants. The Germanic invaders established many small kingdoms on the island, Sussex, and Essex, which refer to the Saxon invaders (West Saxon, South Saxons, and East Saxons), Mercia and East Anglia ruled by the Angles (England was known as ""Angleland.""), and the Celtic kingdoms of what would become Wales and Scotland. These Germanic invaders are very, religion

The King of Mercia in particular was the first to call himself ""Rex Anglorum

Afterward, invaded England and took control of the English crown, and the Danes and Anglo-Saxons traded the crown for a bit. Finally, the Normans under William the Conqueror inavded England bringing yet another Scandinavian-influenced influence into England, this time with a bit of French. Due to the English King holding Normandy, this would entwine the Franks and Britons for pretty much all of history.

The word ""Briton"" comes from the Latin Britannia, so it is possible those names were transmitted to them from those peoples, and of course they bestowed that name upon the Roman conquered and administrated territory.

Thus the Britons are related to the Celts, Goths, Teutons, and Byzantines, and have fought with the Spanish, Saracens, and Turks

**BRITISH BONUSES BRITISH BONUSES BRITISH BONUSES BITCH**

* Shepards work +25% faster

Shepherding has been an extremely vital part of the British economy; in fact, it woudl be the British who would export Sheep to their colonies of New Zealnd. This bonus makes the British very, very fast at in the Dark Age. A little bit surprising that they would have such a specific and good bonus so early on considering that the Dark Ages were pretty ""miserable"" for England but hey, whatevs.

* Town Centers cost -50% W

The Britons were renown for their ability to colonize. Okay, Irish, and French pretty heavily, and a Town Center is a great way to do that encroaching. This is fairly related to the Frankish bonus in that sense because the TC and the Castle are both strong buildings, the Castle for direct defense and the TC so that you can make more villagers; only one civ can get a Castle bonus, so the Brits got the TC bonus (which happens to be a very great economic bonus). They certainly became THE colonizers (or maybe I should say ""colonisers,"" hee hee) after the Middle Ages were over, as well as the original Celtic inhabitants. The Bretons, as well as fairly far off Spain. Even the Romans were especially good at colonising territory. So with all of those influences, right?

* Foot Archers +1/2 Range starting in Castle Age

The Britons possessed one of the only European armies armies where Archers were NOT despised and actually well-trained and equipped

* TEAM BONUS: Archery Ranges work +20%

You may or may not have read in the manuals or other flavor text of AoE2, the Britons banned all sports on Sunday except Archery. They also had a feudal system involving archers rather than Knights. In fact, a royal decree known as the Assize of Arms of 1252 stated that all landholders must train with a bow, and more wealthy landowners must train with a longbow. That's why we get this Archery Range team bonus. The preferred weapon of Richard the Lionhearted, especially during the 3rd Crusade, was the Crossbow, and he used a ton of them. This was obviously before the British started using Longbows.

**AWWWW YEAH

* UNIQUE UNIT: Longbowman

The Longbow was first used by the Welsh agains the British during their invasion of Wales. The Longbow is a bow roughly the size of the person wielding it, which is obviously why they are created from the Castle. In fact, you would think that the British getting an Archery Range bonus when, ideally, they wouldn't even use the Arbalest is kind of weird. In real life, the British Longbowman was replaced by cannoneers and crossbowmen because it was so much easier to train a man to wield those weapons rather than the Longbow. So it makes sense that it's easier to train the Arbalests rather than the Longbowman. Longbowmen had one main advantage over cannons or crossbows, though; they had a much higher rate of fire, not reflected in AoE2 because they lack Thumb Ring. Longbowmen are best on defense

* UNIQUE TECH: Yeoman

A Yeoman occupied a position between the aristocratic Knights and smaller landowners. In fact, but it also gives towers extra attack. The Towers still aren't as powerful as Bombard Towers, but it's a decent boost and it benefits the idea of using an Archer heavy army.

In a few [forum posts on aokheaven made by Sandy Peterson](http://aok.heavengames.com/gameinfo/conquerors-expansion)

I did 2 Infantry civs previously and this is the last Infantry civ in AoE2. I'll be doing the Spanish next to wrap up this part of the series, Montezuma screwed Montezuma).

**THAT VULTURE CAME TO TRY AND STEAL YOUR NAME BUT NOW YOU FOUND A GUN! YOU'RE HISTORY! THIS IS FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE SUN**

In AoE2, along with the Zapotecs and Mixtecs. The other major groups of peoples to inhabit Mesoamerica are the Mayans, although there are a few others.

Our Aztecs are the last groups of Nahuatl peoples to immigrate to Mexico known as the Mexica (pronounced Meshica); their legends state that they came from far to the north from a place called “Atzlan” and scholars refer to the Mexica as Aztecs due to the word meaning “from Aztlan.” Linguistic evidence shows that the language of the Aztecs, as various Nahua peoples had been in Mexico since 400 AD.

Similar to the Germanic invasions in Europe

During the period of the Aztec Empire, was the most powerful due to an alliance it had created with the city-state of Tlacopan and the city-state of Texcoco. What we know as the “Aztec Empire” is more accurately described as the Aztec Triple Alliance.

The Aztecs were seen as very oppressive and barbaric by their neighbors, and after gaining favor with the King of Culhuacan as zealous soldiers they requested that they send his daughter to marry their King. So the King of Culhuacan sends his daughter and a month or so later he goes to see his living and married daughter. Instead, he sees *a priest wearing his daughter's skin as a cloak.* He gathers his allies and bumrushes the Aztecs and forces them into a the shallows in the middle of Lake Texcoco. The Aztecs were okay with this because they saw an eagle perched on a cactus with a snake in it's beak on an island in the lake. Their god Huitzilopotchli had told the Mexica to journey from the north to a place where they would find this symbol and settle there.

In the middle of that lake, and the city was connected by waterways. This island building method made for very fertile land to grow crops on that allowed the Aztecs to thrive until the Spanish conquered them mostly with disease and rallying the subjects of the Aztecs against them.

The Aztecs have fought and conquered the Mayans and had were eventually conquered by the Spanish.

**THE IDEA OF IMPEACHING A RULER COMES FROM AN AZTEC

* All military units train +15% faster

For their entire existence, the Aztec Army had to be dispatched directly from Tenochtitlan. When you play AoE2, you probably realize that building military buildings as a forward base near your opponents is a good idea but the Aztec buildings are very weak so it implies the Aztec's lack of colonies outside of Tenochtitlan. However your main base, your very own Tenochtitlan, is probably the best defended and you are able to field many units quickly from there.

* Monks +5 HP per Monastery tech researched

I can only find scant web articles about scant records about them, even better! This is a fairly expensive bonus, though, and it's kind of weird how the Aztecs need so much gold because they didn't really put much value on it.

*  Villagers carry +5

This is probably in reference to the way the Aztecs built Tenochtitlan and their floating farms. They created a system of agriculture using squares of dirt and mud floating on shallows called “chinampas.” These chinampas were made up of layers of mud alternated with decayed plantlife, then that means less total transit time between the resource and the drop off point making it much more efficient. In the Dark Age, this is actually a hurt rather than a help because you need resources faster than efficiently and you have to micromanage your villagers to get the food flowing but afterward this is a great economic bonus and it gives you extra oomph to your farming because farming is extremely slow. It's the only bonus that increases the efficiency of your farming.

* Loom free

I'm not sure exactly why the Aztecs get this bonus. It's probably the best bonus in the Dark Age because you don't have to worry about Loom at all

* Start with Eagle Warrior

Similar to how the Fire Ship is a unit purely from the pages of Byzantine history, bows, and shields so their light infantry status in game is justified In the Montezuma campaign the protagonist, Cuahtemhoc, starts off as an Eagle Warrior and is “promoted” to Jaguar Warrior. In real life and in-game, the Eagle Warriors were the most feared out of any Aztec military units.

* TEAM BONUS: Relics generate +33%

So this brings me to a point on the Aztec's reliance on gold. I'm a broken record when it comes to this, the Japanese are superior swordsmen, etc. So the Aztecs have hidden treasures of gold that they are hiding from their conquerors, and the Europeans KNOW the New World has gold because their units rely on it; the average Aztec army uses 100 Gold  per Monk plus the Gold to research the techs to improve their Hps and 20 Food and 60 Gold per Eagle Warrior. So the Aztecs also receive stronger benefit from Relics, and this bonus can be interpreted in a few different ways: the Aztec's didn't mine for gold but their faith is a “resource” of some kind, or that the Relics are their hidden stores of gold and it's easy to hide your gold when you're not out mining it, or...that gold is just money in general and my more esoteric interpretations are just overthinking it.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/uj5d1/viva_la_raza_historicity_vs_gameplay_day_17_the/

1361758749.0,1960yd,What Would a ___ Civ Be Like In AoE2 Day 2: The Lithuanians,TheBattler,35,1,11,"TODAY THE LITHUANIANS

TOMORROW THE MOORS

GWA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!

I'M A RAINY LITHUANIAN DANCING AS AN INDIAN

[SeaSquirrel](http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/18uwau/something_a_little_new_for_the_historicity_vs/c8i7tpd) requested the Apache for the last time, the Apache ended up being alot like the Maya. Heh, but we'll see where we can take the next few civs.

**LITHUANIAN HISTORY**

So [Sex_E_Searcher](http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/18uwau/something_a_little_new_for_the_historicity_vs/c8ia860) was the one who suggested this civ and he stated that the Lithuanians were the last pagan kingdom in Europe. That got my interest piqued. Also dawg

Indeed

Lithuania's stateship began when the Teutonic Knights began a Crusade into the Baltic regions, and converted to Christianity to seal the deal of peace. In fact Mindaugas was the ONLY king of Lithuania as he was said to have went back to Baltic Paganism. Lithuania became a Grand Duchy again although it would Christianize in 1387 fo good.

In those hundred years between Mindaugas and Christianization, and they ate up Kiev all the way to the Black Sea. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania was almost as big as present-day Lithuania, Ukraine, Belarus, and Latvia combined. Poland and Lithuania would unite, kind of like how Hungary and Austria would, to form a huge nation. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was the first Constitutional Monarchy

The Lithuanians frequently fought with AoE2's Teutons, and even had a fairly even contention with the Mongol Golden Horde. So I want to design a civ that has some aspects of the ""pagan"" civs in the game, like the Vikings, Aztecs, and Huns combined with the Knightly civs such as the Franks, Teutons, and Spanish. They should also be a late game powerhouse as their state was at it's greatest height by the Imperial Age especially after joining together with Poland.

I also want them to be kind of the polar opposites of the Teutons. The war between the Teutonic Knights and Lithuanians was very brutal

**LITHUANIAN BONUSES AND UNIQUES**

* MILITARY BONUS: Some sort of cavalry bonus. Free Husbandry?

Lithuania proper is located on the fringe of the Eurasian Steppe but they conquered large parts of it. So their horses should be pretty good but not as good as the other true horse civs. Free Husbandry would accomplish the goal of making their units opposite of the Teutons. It's resources saved and it makes a Knight rush fairly good. The Lithuanians should get a pretty good early Castle Age because that's when their political state emerged and that's when they expanded their empire.

* MILITARY/DEFENSIVE BONUS: Military buildings +20% HPs

The same way the Teutons have 3 small defensive bonuses (Tower garrison, I'd rather give the Lithuanians a few small Military bonuses in the same vein. The idea behind this is that even under constant warfare, the Lithuanians would be able to churn out soldiers to fight for them from their stronger military buildings. Your military buildings would most likely be on the border near your enemies so this isn't quite a defensive bonus. The Lithuanians would also get Masonry and Architecture, which means that in the Imperial Age their military buildings have the same HP as Byzantine ones but also have the added benefit of more building armor. Maybe even Castles could benefit. If we prevent the Lithuanians from getting Hoardings their Castles would have about 6720 HP, which would make them stronger than Castles with Masonry and Hoardings. This bonus also parallels the Slavic Team Bonus a little bit.

* MILITARY BONUS: Some sort of ""pagan"" bonus? Heresy free? Heresy costs 0 gold and researches in 2 seconds? Knights resist conversion like Hussars?

[Uhhhhh](http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/31450812.jpg). I'm not feeling too creative with the cavalry bonuses. [SO YOU GOTTA HELP US!](http://images.wikia.com/ideas/images/6/65/Hotel-Mario-Luigi-580x435.jpg). I came up with this bonus to reflect the pagan nature of the Lithuanians. I came up with the second bonus just in case the player doesn't want to research Heresy. If you don't, except with way higher HP. This is the opposite of the Teuton team bonus, which affects all units.

* ECONOMIC BONUS: A farming bonus. I'm not sure

Lithuania was all about the farming. Much of Lithuania's territory lay in present-day Ukraine, and nuts, as well as grain and sugar. Once the Polish and Lithuanian joined together, they grew a ridiculous amount of grain. So they should definitely have some sort of Farming bonus. The half the space thing is a bonus I came up with a long time ago for the Aztecs, since their whole thing was creating farms upon Lake Texcoco. It would still be okay for the Lithuanians.

* TEAM BONUS: Cavalry +2 Atk vs Cavalry

I know this is weird but I have a plan. I'm going to prevent the Lithuanians from having Halberdiers, you have Lancers instead of Camels and Eagles, and Polish Lancers are among the best. The Polish armies and Lithuanian armies would have been pretty similar.

* UNIQUE UNIT: Bajorija

A Bajorija is a Lithuanian nobleman, low HP, low Attack, slightly faster than regular Knights, and HP regeneration. They would be able to barely beat Knights 1v1 thanks to their Team Bonus. They'd probably be most useful for raiding, attacking Archers and Villagers.

* CASTLE UNIQUE TECH: Romuva

Romuva is the modern name for the Baltic religion followed by the Lithuanians. Romuva was purportedly a Temple in the Baltic area encountered by the Teutonic Order. Romuva supposedly had it's own ""Pagan Pope, honestly.

* IMPERIAL UNIQUE TECH: Commonwealth

And obvious reference to the Lithuanian-Polish Commonwealth. I'm not exactly sure what this would be. I was thinking of taking away the the Lithuanian economic bonus and making this into sort of an extra Mill technology. The Commonwealth made ridiculous amounts of grain and exported it to Western Europe. If it were an extra",self,t5_2sg7u,1361762292.0,,Blank,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1960yd/what_would_a_civ_be_like_in_aoe2_day_2_the/

My ghetto meter has actually run on empty

Currently there are 4 civilizations left to talk about: the Aztecs, and the Spanish. I'm probably going to move on to the Forgotten Empires civs, and I know that there is a user who's involved with that project here; I can't ask Ensemble Studios if my conjectures on their design choices are true, but I can ask somebody on the Forgotten Empires crew.

**HISTORY OF DEM PERSIANS**

The Persian civilization in AoE2 is seemingly modeled solely after the Sassanid Dynasty of Persia

In game, and inexplicably War Elephants in your face. The Ghengis Khan campaign features the Khwarezm Empire and the city of Samarqand as the Persians. Finally, the first Hun mission has the Persian Empire as one of the 3 enemies you can defeat, and I believe this mission references the Hun incursions into Armenia, especially considering that the Huns are firmly in Scythian territory.

During the Dark Ages, the Persian ""Knight."" When both empires were exhausted, the Muslim Arabs burst onto the scene and conquered many Roman holdings and all of Persia. From that point on, there would be no ""Persia,"" at least not in the political sense.

Persians would attain high positions in the Arab Empires due to them carrying on many Persian traditions, Ghurid, and Khwarazmian Empires. These Dynasties were actually led by clans of Turkish slave-warriors, Mamelukes in fact, who were first taken in by Persian benefactors. Eventually they rose to higher positions in society, including becoming governors of cities and then regions and finally of whole countries. The Persians endowed tons of culture to the Turks, especially architecture considering the Turks were previously steppe nomads.

Those Empires were eventually incorporated into the Seljuq Dynasty's empire, the Levant, Egypt, Anatolia, and the Muslim holy cities on the Arabian coast. The Seljuq Dynasty was still technically a part of the Baghdad Caliphate, and you could say that the Arabs were the religious leaders, the Turks the military leaders, the Seljuq and Khwarezm Empires were mowed down by the Mongols.

After the disintegration of the Mongol Empire

The final Persian dynasty of the Middle Ages was the Safavid Dynasty

So anyhow, they even had some small-scale conflict with the Chinese, they were conquered by the Mongols, and many Persians eventually took part in the Crusades especially the three-way conflict between the Mongol Ilkhanate, Mamluk Egypt, and the Crusaders. The Persians were definitely the forerunners to the Arabs and Turks and to an extent the Mongols.

**BITCH I RUN AROUND WITH MY BONUS POWERS LIKE I'M A PRINCE OF PERSIA**

* Town Centers and Docks work +5/10/15/20% faster; Town Centers and Docks 2x HPs

Every time the Persians were conquered, and infrastructure. When a new administration came into power in other parts of the world, often times they would cut out the previous traditions and replace it with their own ranks and bureaucracy. Civilizations that neighbored Persia or were under Persia's suzerainty would see Persia as sort of a golden goose, and why would you ever kill the goose that lays the golden eggs? They'd often inherit and adopt the Persian ways, such as their roads, trade routes, etc. These civilizations included the Macedonians, the Arabs, Castles, say

* Start with +50 F and w

The Sassanid Empire was among the strongest civilizations during the Dark Age. Nowadays the idea of the Dark Ages being particularly crappier (Dark was originally coined because we don't have many records of the period
low point in their civilizations just prior and during the Islamic invasion but during the majority of the European ""Dark Ages"" they were pretty well off. So you get this bonus. The Persians have a [famous refrigeration system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakhchal) for their food involving...uhh

* TEAM BONUS: Knights +2 Atk vs Archers

Persia used the Composite Bow to great effect, too. Persia was situated right near the Central Asian steppes, which meant that they would have also had to deal with nomads utilizing the Horse and the Bow. Their wars with Babylonians, Assyrians, Scythians, Turks, Arabs, and Tajiks showed them how to use the Bow and also how to defeat Archers. In fact
So it makes sense that Persian Knights are among the best archery counters.

**Livestream!**

Not a fan of reading? You can join me and the community team live tomorrow at 10AM Pacific twitch.tv/ageofempires – or right in the game launcher – for all of the info below and more!

**Steam Summer Sale!**

If you’ve been waiting for a sale

**Trading Cards**

I’ve been hearing a lot of comments recently around trading cards and the program Valve has started. Like many of you, we’ve got a lot we’ll be doing with AOE II HD down the road! 

**More streams &amp; Blogs**

Over the next two months, and streams for the franchise. Got a suggestion on what we should talk about for a stream? Preferences on any particular people we should talk with or include on a stream or blog? A favorite custom scenario we should demo? Let us know by posting here!

**Beta Patch 2.5**

We’re excited to announce our next beta patch, but wanted to give you the opportunity to check it out immediately! 

**Ladders &amp; Rankings**

Since launch, 2.5 beta onward will be using entirely new ladders, so you’ll be starting fresh. When we go from beta to the masses, we’ll reset the boards so everyone starts as a level footing.

How will the new leaderboards be organized? The core functionality will operate on a ranked ELO system, and with 2.6 and beyond may see implementations of new short term “challenge” boards we reset from time to time, decay systems, and more. For now though our focus is on implementing a meaningful competitive leaderboard. 

To do so, and are really looking forward to seeing what they do with the new ladders. 

**Launcher Updates**

Our game launcher has been a useful way to provide some patch update notifications, but will allow us to put up new information easier, and even create live streams right into the launcher. This particular piece will be finalized once we push 2.5 out to the public.

**Gameplay Changes / Updates**

Beta 2.4 was an experimental patch for us in many ways, and it allowed us to identify a number of issues to fix that would otherwise not have been apparent. 

One of the biggest modifications in beta patch 2.4 was the unit selection size. While the 40 from the original game was often cited as restrictive, but combined with the second challenge it affected gameplay more than we were comfortable with.

The second issue has to do with unit formations and movement AI. Over a decade ago the command structure and pathing for the game was handled in a way designed for 28.8 or 56k modems and Pentium CPUs popular at the turn of the century. The movement logic is something we're delving into

**Lobby Changes**

The existing lobby system provides some basic information, including their ELO for that ladder. 
The biggest lobby request we’ve heard is unfortunately surprisingly tough due to the steam matchmaking API. We’re not able to get ping numbers directly through steam, and some of the things we are looking into, but to help you select your games better, we’ve added in a lobby filter titled “region” with several settings. 
.

-----------------------------------

-----------------------------------

-----------------------------------

-----------------------------------

**Full list of Patch Notes (from 2.3)**
&gt;**Tech tree**:
&gt;&gt;* Implementation of unique unit with purple legend entry
&gt;&gt;* Tech tree should show up properly at all scales on both the left and right side. There were several clipping bugs when the window was at a 4:3 aspect ratio.
&gt;&gt;* Scrolling to the left or right in windowed mode should feel right. Before it would only scroll in some cases when you were well outside the window boundaries. 
&gt;&gt;* Scrolling should be disabled when you are close to the bottom of the window so it doesn’t interfere with resizing.
&gt;&gt;* Scroll and close buttons are always centered now in any resolution/aspect ratio.



-----------------------------------
&gt;**Gameplay**
&gt;&gt;* **Maximum Selection Size**
&gt;&gt;* Increased from 40 (2.3) to 60 (2.5). Backed down from 200 in 2.4beta due to aforementioned reasons
&gt;&gt;* **Hotkeys**
&gt;&gt;* Reverted hotkey changes from 2.3 that caused incorrectly functioning shift + alt control group commands
&gt;&gt;* You can now hotkey groups 0-9. (An added control group over the original 1-9)
&gt;&gt;* The hotkey reset button will not scroll the menu to the top of the screen anymore
&gt;&gt;* Clicking “reset hotkeys” will restore the key to the default instead of making there be no hotkey for the item.

-----------------------------------
&gt;**Localization**
&gt;&gt;* English strings are no longer locked inside language.dll
&gt;&gt;* Steam Stats / Achievements
&gt;&gt;* Single Battle Buildings Razed stat and Single Battle Buildings Lost stat was incorrectly using units lost and has been corrected. These stats/achievements will be reset on the official 2.5 release

-----------------------------------
&gt;**Cheats**
&gt;&gt;* From 2.3, gold, and stone are now 10,000 instead of 1,000 and should reduce the wear and tear on your ctrl + v keys.

-----------------------------------
&gt;**Lobby / Quickmatch**
&gt;&gt;* Since only a small % of players utilize the beta build
&gt;&gt;* Quickmatch should match players with the closest applicable ELO ratings and should use DM or RM ratings depending on which mode is selected.
&gt;&gt;* Lobby games are now sorted properly
&gt;&gt;* Regional settings for lobbies will be primarily based on your Steam download region settings
&gt;&gt;* You can filter lobbies and quickmatch by regional settings including:
&gt;&gt;* Worldwide – Shows everyone on the patch!
&gt;&gt;* Far – Within a continent or two roughly. 
&gt;&gt;* Regional – Your region and surrounding regions
&gt;&gt;* Close – Only games in the same region as you
&gt;&gt;* Additional information in the lobby browser. Clicking once on a game will display added info including:
&gt;&gt;* Names of players in game
&gt;&gt;* ELO of players in game for the associated gametype
&gt;&gt;* Indication of whether the game is RM or DM
&gt;&gt;* Other misc information (i.e. scenario name)
&gt;&gt;* Double click to join a game lobby

-----------------------------------
&gt;**Performance changes from 2.3**
&gt;&gt;* Internal frame rate is capped at 60 (from 20).
&gt;&gt;* User interface updates 10 times per second as opposed to once per second. (mini-map
&gt;&gt;* If you encounter any issues with frame rate unlocks, so you may eventually want to remove it later

-----------------------------------
&gt;**Leaderboards &amp; ELO Ratings**
&gt;&gt;* The ELO calculations have been completely rewritten from the live version in 2.3 and follow the old MS Zone calculations. These boards will be reset again at the go-live for 2.5. Here are the known rules
&gt;&gt;* Leaderboard ELO calculations are only considered for games that contain exactly two teams. Any other combinations of teams are not considered for ELO calculations
&gt;&gt;* There are two separate ranked leaderboards which encompass the following:
&gt;&gt;* Deathmatch games will be ranked on the DM leaderboard.
&gt;&gt;* Random Map, Regicide, Defend the Wonder, and Wonder Race are part of the RM leaderboard. 
&gt;&gt;* Any other mode will not be considered for ELO score calculations and is unranked
&gt;&gt;* There is a minimum time that a ranked game requires before the game will be officially calculated on the leaderboard. 2 minutes for DM and 5 minutes for RM. Games under those time limits are considered pre-maturely completed and are not scored. 
&gt;&gt;* A pre-game penalty is deducted for starting any ranked match. The 3 points is refunded back at the end of the game – whether you win, or quit, irregardless of the time limits for determining whether an ELO calculation kicks in (5 minutes RM, 2 minutes DM). It is designed to penalize players that pull the network plug to avoid finishing games.
&gt;&gt;* Any MP game that is saved and restored later will be considered an unranked game to avoid exploitation.

-----------------------------------
&gt;**Known Issues**
&gt;&gt;* It is highly recommended when moving to the beta build (or when upgrading between builds) to create a new player profile to avoid any potential conflicts during the upgrade. You can do so within the game by going to options
&gt;&gt;*  If you do a fresh install of AOE II HD after having the game on your system
&gt;&gt;*  We are tracking several rare crashes across multiple versions on windows XP during campaign play and will continue to investigate to improve stability.
&gt;&gt;*  Please ensure you are using a copy legitimately purchased through official retail channels (amazon, etc) and downloaded through Steam when attempting to play AOE II HD. We cannot support issues that may crop up with other versions. 
&gt;&gt;*  We’re investigating some double-byte language display issues (Korean, and Chinese) as part of the language system transition we are doing here.",AoC HD,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1373657242.0,Blank,

**WE WILL BE VINDICATED BY HISTORY**

This is the most boring section so I’m just going to try and talk about some interesting stuff that you probably don’t know about. Well

The word “Inca” means “Lord” in the Inca language,” which means “Four United Regions” and refers to each district or “Suyu” of the empire. The entirety of the people became known as “Inca” because the Spanish integrated the upper classes of their new colony into their conquest.

South America is home not just to the Inca but also numerous other tribes and one of the things that really got my historical loins stirring is the story of the first European contact with the Amazonians. A Portuguese explorer whose name escapes me entered the Amazons and there the natives told him about a great “white king” who lived far to the west and the riches of his empire.

This explorer guy actually convinced an army of Amazonians to try and conquer the land of the white king

I think.

So that was pretty crazy.

Another crazy thing is that the Inca traded with the Muisca people who lived in present-day Colombia. The Muiscans had a small confederation of tribes and villages and were part of the greater Chibchah people, and Costa Rica. We have evidence that the Chibchah traded with the Mayans and the Aztecs, and they also traded with the Inca. That’s the closest we’ve gotten to Inca-Meso contact.

There are some weirdos who think that a group related to the Inca migrated out of South America and made it to Mesoamerica and then called themselves the Purepecha AKA the Tarascans.

Out of all the civs in AoE2

**WE DOIN’ BIG INCA BE UNIQUE check ‘em out now BIG INCA ON BONUSES PEAK**

* Start with free Turkey

The Inca didn’t have Turkeys so right off the start you might think this is historically inaccurate. On face value it is, mule, camel, and the ox allowed far away civilizations to communicate with one another. Only the South American civilizations had a draft animal, the llama. I believe that this bonus represents this idea. If you also believe that the Incas represent a broader swath of civilizations, then you’ll realize that the Incas are a strong early game civ thanks to this and other bonuses. South America is home to the oldest civilizations in the Americas and this gives the Incas a strong base from which they derived their own culture.

* Houses support +5 population

I’m not really sure what this bonus is supposed to represent but I’ve got a few ideas. The Andes doesn’t have much wood, so when you combine this with their building Stone price reduction, you can pretend that the 15% of Stone for those buildings is secretly whisked away to the Inca Houses...or not, because that doesn’t really make any sense. The other main thing to consider is the fact that the Inca’s best tool was population. They always had the most manpower of any other state in the region. Their massive stone cities were built without the wheel and they needed a huge organized force to build them. Their armies were pretty huge and most adult males in the Empire were always ready for combat.  An interesting part of the Inca system was their use of diplomacy rather than conquest. They were conquerors for sure, but they often added other groups to their empire by lavishing their rulers with gifts and showing them the benefits of Inca society, thus avoiding conflict and adding a ready population to their polity.

* Villagers affected by Infantry Blacksmith upgrades

I can’t tell the exact historical significance of this, although this wasn’t moreso than European polities. But by the 16th century, there were more professional armies in Europe so the farmers and merchants and workers could be considered “soft.” Not so in the Inca Empire. Another thing is that the people of the Andes are hardier than people from elsewhere in the world. Their blood is thicker and their lungs can hold more oxygen, suiting them to an oxygen-scarce environment such as the high mountains. While the Incas didn’t have iron, they might have had more “iron” in their blood.

* Buildings cost -15% Stone

The Incas were expert stone masons. If you google search Inca buildings, and then they managed to place them on top of each other without any mortar to form pretty decent geometric shapes. That’s not to say the Incas just stumbled upon geometry: they also had buildings made of adobe and mortar that were more similar to Old World buildings and these were mainly for ceremonial places and temples. Their huge stone block buildings had rounded corners and edges and were usually sloped inwards so combined with their jigsaw nature, they have fantastic earthquake resistance. In gameplay, this means an Inca build a tower in the Feudal Age, and then build a TC in the Castle Age with their starting Stone, which is something no other civs can do. They are also the only civ to have cheaper Towers and Outposts, and have the Stone cost for TCs reduced.

* Team Bonus: Farms built +50% faster

Inca Farming was fantastic,

* UNIQUE UNIT: Kamayuk: Anti-Cavalry Infantry with slight ranged attack

Kamayuks are officers in the Inca army. They have huge ass spears that give them 1 range but this is not accurate at all. Pikes are supposed to be like 12 feet long, I think they lose to Champions up to around 5 units.

* UNIQUE UNIT: Slinger: Anti-Infantry Archer

I like to think of the Slinger as the true Inca UU. It’s a really great unit. It’s a ranged unit that slaughters Infantry (though, the Ram, and that’s why I think this dude is most useful. They also kill Trebs, and they only have 1 less attack than Arblaests. I mean, that’s actually rather significant but they do pretty well in the regular Archer role thanks to their UT which upgrades their foot speed. Anyway the sling is a weapon used by many cultures but it fell out of use in the late medieval period. The reason the Incas get a handy Slinger for the later stage of the game is because they made good use of slings as well as the ayllo. I’ll explain what the Ayllo is in a bit.

* UNIQUE TECH: Andean Slings: Slingers

“Andean slings” tend to refer to the semi-unique Inca weapon, which they call Estolica.

* UNIQUE TECH: Couriers: Eagles

This tech is a reference to the chaskis, the Incas would create [very unsafe looking bridges made of rope](http://www.proprofs.com/flashcards/upload/a4081993.jpg). These bridges would have to be maintained by the local villagers as part of their tribute to the Inca ruler. Another trait of the road system are the stop off points set at a day’s march from each other, which would be maintained with food by citizens in order to give the Chaskis and armies rest and supplies. Since much of the Incas’ state was in the mountains, so stairways were a common part of the roads. Llamas are very similar to goats and they readily climb up steep inclines but  Spaniards horses did not like stairs. Inca Eagles become as fast as Mangudai, and they are only slightly outdone by Light Cavalry.

* WONDER: Macchu Picchu

This Wonder appears to be a juxtaposition of several elements of Macchu Picchu. Macchu Picchu means “Old Dude Mountain/Pyramid, although it looks nothing like it. The little slits above the entrance looks like [this](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_7iQgfkaWJAE/S_RelLhzwBI/AAAAAAAABRI/mSqQQJJ6ewc/s400/Machu+Picchu+159++4x3+.jpg).

* LANGUAGE: Quechua

Quechua is pretty rad I guess. There’s a whole bunch of Quechua related languages in and around the Inca Empire, FUCK. One of the crazier things about Quechua (and Aymara) is that the past is in front of Quechua speakers while the future is behind, whereas most people think that we point forward towards the future while the past is left behind. I think the idea is that everybody has knowledge of what’s happened in the past while we can’t see the future or some shit.

1365371166.0,1bvjrk,Rating/Matchmaking/Lobby are Completely Broken,mariano54,39,5,18,"Hi, it is very hard to stay. Let me explain. I know there are problems with lag/connectivity

In Voobly, and try to improve your skills / increase your rating. Yes, there were many problems with voobly, but in general it was easy to set up a balanced game of up to 4v4. 

Now, quickplay sets you up with a similar opponent, and then ranks you on the ladder based on your performance. Quickplay here though, has many issues.

* It does not let you choose normal game speed (I don't know who made this horrible decision).
     
* If you choose random
     
* It does not let you change other game settings
     
* It does not match you with similar skill opponents!! How is this possible? This makes no sense. In a game where even the slightest change in skill/experience will make the game one sided

Ok so quickplay is not ideal

* No unrated games...
     
* No ratings displayed. How am I supposed to see how good people are?? Once again I have to specify (previous experience/no noobs) and yet I still have never gotten a balanced 4v4! Even if ratings are specified, since one can simply raise rating by playing quickplay and **winning every time** against average players. 
     
* Different regions for each continent. I have friends in Argentina. There are people with friends/family all over the world. We don't want to change some random file to fix this. Make this worldwide! People in Australia for example only see 5 games in the lobby.
     
* No custom Scenario lobby. Also custom scenarios don't have a different rating system. 

Now, but I don't think I can stand these matchmaking problems for too much longer. It is very difficult to set up an even game. I can imagine how frustrated better players would be. This rating system means nothing for them, since anyone can get to the top. There are no leaderboards, and you can't see another person's rating. 

I hoped that this HD version would revive the competitive scene of AoC. But it looks like this is not going to happen. I can't see any serious pro gamer playing the HD version with the current state of things.

However, and it will increase not only the long term survival of the multiplayer aspect, but also their profit!

**I want anybody who reads this to make suggestions for the civ attributes and tech tree.**

**APACHE HISTORY**

I'm not going to go much into depth on the history of the civs for this series because this is honestly the most boring part of each installment. I will try to talk more about how the civ's history would apply to their design if they were in Age of Empires 2.

The Apache and the Navajo peoples migrated from around present-day Alaska and Yukon to head far south to the American southwest. Their mythology features a migration narrative and their languages are related to the people of the north. Heck

Most of our info about the Apache during the extremely late Medieval period (I'm talking 1540s-1600) comes from Spanish expeditions after the conquest of the Aztec Empire and we can make some extrapolations from their later history.

The Apache were a very nomadic

The Navajo interacted with the Puebloan people and learned some parts of their sedentary culture. The Navajo grew crops so we can have them create Mills and Farms with little repercussions. Hell

Heck if one were to create some sort of North American expansion that included the Puebloan peoples

**APACHE BONUSES AND UNIQUES**

* ECONOMIC BONUS: Some sort of bonus relating to Hunting

While the Navajo did Farm, and this would include Forage Bushes, Deer, and maybe even Turkeys or Sheep or Fish. A hypothetical Apache player would get 196 Food from a Deer, which is another Villager. 175 from a Forage Bush, that's a whole Villager compared to a regular Forage Bush. They'd get 476 Food from a Boar, which is almost the entire Feudal Age.

* MILITARY BONUS: Related to Archery? Archers +10% attack speed in Castle Age and +10% in Imperial Age for 20% total?

I had an idea for the Apache. They'd lack Crossbowman and Arbalest but they'd bonuses and techs to compensate and ultimately save on resources and time in the long run. Their Archers would fire faster than any other Archer such that they'd be equal to the Arbalests of other civs. I think their civ should focus on high aggression.

* DEFENSIVE BONUS: Something related to Teepees. Maybe they fight better near their Houses? Perhaps they build Teepees instead of Houses. Teepees would still give +5 population but are weaker. Units can garrison inside but don't fire arrows. Military units nearby attack +10% faster when in LoS of a Teepee? 

In Age of Empires 3, and the Teepees would give nearby units a buff. The Sioux are not Apache, but their ways of life are fairly similar and a similar bonus could work. The idea here would be to encourage the Apache to build a forward  base. They'd have a strong Dark and Feudal Age and they could raid the enemy base, build a Barracks and an Archery Range, and build their Houses at their forward base. Think of how nomadic that sounds? Think of how warlike that sounds? Strategic? These are attributes of the Apache.

Maybe the Teepees could be a ""unique building"" of the Apache

* MILITARY BONUS: Start with Eagle Scout instead of Scout Cavalry

By the way, and one Defensive Bonus, I just came up with some random bonuses and framed them that way. A couple of civs should have 2 Military bonuses and a 1 Economic one. Or maybe be like the Teutons and have like 3 Defensive bonuses. I'm actually glad I had 1 bonus of each broad category just to demonstrate how this will work. Anyway, the Apache didn't have ""Eagle Warriors,"" but neither did the Inca. The Mayans didn't really, though judging by their imagery there had to be at least one guy who looked at their stone murals and thought dressing up as an Eagle for battle was a good idea.

* TEAM BONUS: MILITARY BONUS: Houses/Teepees +4 LoS? Archery Range units +2 Atk vs Gunpowder units.

I thought that the LoS bonus would go well with their whole Teepee shtick.

The Apache managed to defeat enemies with superior arms frequently so giving their Skirms extra attack vs gunpowder units would give them a unique niche compared to Eagles

* UNIQUE UNIT: Tomahawk?

I know that these guys are supposed to be an Archer civ

The UU should probably be an anti-Villager unit. See

* CASTLE UNIQUE TECH: Archers +10% Movement Speed? All military units 5% faster movement speed?

No other civ has faster moving foot Archers. I can't quite see this being too OP considering Cavalry Archers exist and plus it would be researchable only at the Castle. If this were a bonus and available all game

* IMPERIAL UNIQUE TECH: Archers +30% HPs

WE GONNA LEARN ABOUT HUNGARAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY




**LMAO MAGYAR HISTORY!? MORE LIKE MA-GAY-AR HISTORY HUR HUR HUR GET I PUT THE WORD GAY IN THERE LOLOLOL!**

The Magyars of Forgotten Empires represents the present-day Hungarian people starting with their very first appearance in Europe. The word ""Hungarian"" comes from the On-oghur Confederation that existed in present-day Russia near the Black Sea while the Hungarians ethnonym is Magyar. On-oghur means ""ten arrows"" in Turkish You'll notice that this is kind of similar to the words Avar, and that's because those guys were probably in the On-Oghur Confederation, too, and the original Hungarians intermarried with them but their language is completely different but I'll get to that later. Most Europeans believed the Magyars to be yet another wave of invaders from the same tribe that started with the Huns. It seems like the Magyars had no problem with this idea and probably identified themselves as members of a larger Turkish ethnicity at the time. Some of them even claimed to be descended from the Huns. For a long period of time you had Hungarians with Turkic names participating in European affairs, marrying and inheriting land. Byzantine Emperor would even refer to Hungary as ""West Tourkia"" and to the Khazar state as ""East Tourkia."" Tourkia is a cognate of ""Turkiyye,"" which roughly means ""land of the Turks.""

The Hungarians cameo in Age of Empires 2 fairly early during the Ghengis Khan campaign. The final scenario features a 1v1 battle between the Mongols and the Hungarian town of Muhi. Since the Magyars didn't exist back then

Our Magyars start off somewhere on the steppes north of the Black Sea. The Scythians, with some of them settling Scandinavia as well as far north in Siberia. A portion of these people were caught up with the Turks at this time, teaching the Magyars to use raise horses and fight as cavalry. We can infer that the Magyars did pretty okay and were not quite conquered because they retained their language. Langauges tend to spread because the ruling class who are frequently conquerors of a certain people will use that language.

The Hungarians were Christianized in around 970 and Saint Stephen was married to Giselle of Bavaria, due to their relations with the Holy Roman Empire the Hungarians would favor Catholicism even more and create prohibitions on Muslims, Jews, and Greek Orthodoxy.

Even as an identifiably European power, Cumans, and Kipchaks. When the Mongols invaded the Cuman-Kipchak Khanates, many refugees from that area went to Hungary. There was some pretty terrible uprisings as a result but that's another story for anotehr day. Trade was obviously important and when the Mongols invaded Khazaria, many of the tribes living there fled to Hungary. The Mongol Invasion would be a hell of a turning point for the Hungarians as they trusted the eastern arrivals less and less and suspected them of helping the Mongols. They would become an Empire. Thanks to how fucked up the European marriage and land inheritance system was, Hungary was ruled by members of the Angevin Dynasty, the same Dynasty from which Henry II and his son Richard the Lionhearted comes from. Hungary and Poland was ruled by the same Angevin ruler for a while

The Hungarians participated in a few Crusades. Frederick Barbarossa convinced one of the Hungarian Princes to join him with a contingent. The Ottomans eventually conquered most of Hungary and the land was partitioned between the Hapsburgs

The Hungarians fought against the Huns, Byzantines, Goths, Franks, Italians, and Turks.

**POTLEK POTLEK POTLEK**

* Villagers kill wolves with 1 strike

This is pretty much their only ""economic"" bonus. The Magyars are sort of like the reverse Byzantines, heaviest, dreadlock looking coat you've ever seen and was meant to fight wolves, with it's heavy coat acting as armor against wolf bites. So I guess you can imagine a Komondor walking aruond with his owner, killing wolves in one hit.

* Forging

The bonus that makes the Magyars so dangerous. The Melee offensive Blacksmith techs are not researched too often in higher level games until economies are stronger in late Castle and Imperial, and then your Scouts will kill Villies in 8 hits rather than 10.

* Scout Cavalry line costs -10%

The horse archer civs all get bonuses that benefit Scout Cavalry. Huns get 20% faster working Stables, and the Magyars get cheaper Scouts. This is something of a nod to their semi-nomadic roots but it's also definitely also a reference to the Hussars themselves who are built from the Stable. I had originally talked about Hussars here and ended up having nothing to talk about for the Unique Unit so I'll expound on the Hussar there. Present-day Hungary was very attractive to the horse archer civilizations such as the Huns and Bulgars because of the Pannonian Basin, a wide open plain that happened to resemble the steppes of Russia. It was a great place to raise horses so the Hungarians remained a great horse power for the entire Middle Ages. The Magyars have a pumped up Husssar as their UU but the regular Hussars is still useful because the Magyars lack Faith and the Magyar Huszar lacks an attack bonus vs Monks.

* TEAM BONUS: Foot archers +2 LoS

Owing to their semi-nomadic roots, hides, and wood glued together) in a reflex shape. They most certainly got the bow design from their time in Central Asia. This is akin to the Mongol Scout Cavalry LoS bonus, although not quite as strong as the Mongol bonus obviously affects their first Scout.

The Magyars are tough semi-nomads with a penchant for horsemanship and archery.

Actually I remember the Magyars having a few different bonuses than what they have right now: buildings cost -15% and foot Archers having +20% HPs. The building one might have been too strong of a bonus given how strong the Magyars are militarily,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1360460995.0,,Blank,t3_1881e6

**EL HISTORIA DE ESPAÑA LOOK AT THAT TILDE BITCH**

The Spanish in AoE2 seem to be more representative of the unified Kingdom of Spain at the end of the Middle Ages. Pretty much every aspect of the Spanish in game seems to reference the Spanish colonial period. We first see the Spanish in the El Cid campaign, where they contributed to a massive, Christian naval alliance called the Holy League that set out to do battle with the Ottoman Empire. The Spanish are obviously the antagonists of the Montezuma campaign.

In Age of Empires 2, Aragon, Leon, and Barcelona. Portugal's  first King received recognition from the Pope to be a separate Kingdom. Portugal's Medieval activity is pretty similar to the Spanish, anyway, with naval and colonization efforts. The Portugese and Spanish are seperate civs in AoE3.

If you remember reading about the Goths, they had adopted Latin and many Roman customs and thus they could be considered Spanish. The word Spain comes from “Hispania,” which was the Roman word for Spain and might mean “western land.”

Spain was defined by it's 800 year conflict with the Moors, and were eventually conquered by the Spanish. This was seen as Christianity vs Islam, although there were periods of toleration from both sides where knowledge flowed to and from each. Spain grew rich from the Moors who had translated Latin and Greek manuscripts on science, and they also had access to trade routes in North Africa that stretched to Arabia and thus even further east.

As everybody knows, with a large naval fleet, colonies for population growth, and trade.

The Spanish are related to Germanic peoples such as the Franks, Vikings, and Britons, with roots in Celtic Iberia, they've had conflicts with the Saracens, Ottoman Turks, and the Byzantines.

**PRIMAS DE ESPAÑOLES**

* Builders work +30% faster except for Wonders

The Spanish were probably not more notable as builders than any other European civ, Towers, and Castles all over the region. Many towns and cities in Spain would change hands between the Spanish and the Moors, and occasionally the Spanish would tear down Moorish Mosques and use them as foundation for Cathedrals. This bonus probably reflects more on the Spanish colonization efforts in the New World. At the tail end of the Middle Ages, Spain would create many colonies with fortifications and government centers quickly in their new territories and just like in game, this bonus is much more powerful late game than early. The Spanish had to create many colonies in the New World somehow and this bonus really reflects it. What is kind of crazy is that the Spanish had been colonizing long before the discovery of the New World as the Kingdom of Aragon conquered many territories in the Mediterranean Sea and colonized them.

* Blacksmith upgrades don't cost gold

My theory that the Spanish bonuses are meant to reflect a technologically superior civilization leads us to the Blacksmith. The Spaniards are the only civilization to receive a direct bonus to the Blacksmith. The most prolific Blacksmiths in medieval times were the Chinese, who were the guardians of the incredibly high quality Damascus steel. Spain was very high up there, though, as the Steel foundries in Toledo produced high quality steel, as well, perhaps the technique having been transmitted from the Arabs in Damascus to the Muslim conquerors of Spain. And yet before the Spanish and Moorish wars the city of Toledo, known as Toletum,” imagine the Spanish reliance on Steel in the conquests of the New World: Spanish and their steel crossbows

* Cannon Galleons benefit from Ballistics

The Spanish Navy was pretty damn powerful during the Middle Ages and for longer than this bonus would imply. The Kingdom of Aragon competed with Genoa and Venice in terms of naval activity in the Mediterranean, southern Italy, and even parts of Greece. The Kingdom of Castile, on the opposite side of Spain, took the Canary Islands and fought the Moors by capturing key ports on the peninsula. Spanish ships were important to finding and holding the New World, but the actual martial power of the ships came into play more often in the Mediterranean Sea in the struggle against the Ottoman Empire. Spain jockeyed with the Turks for control of the North African coast and was a key member of the Holy League during the Battle of Lepanto (and you control the Spains for the scenario in AoE2). The Spanish style of naval warfare was to ram and board enemy ships with their swordsmen and gunners, so it's a little weird that the Cannon Galleons get this bonus. In fact it's partly because of this style that the Spanish Armada lost to a British fleet which ironically won because their ships were designed with cannons and ranged warfare in mind.

* Hand Cannoneers and Bombard Cannons	fire +15% faster

Yet another bonus for gunpowder. Spanish HCs are better than Turkish HCs, the Spanish didn't quite have especially better cannons than anybody else but again, it's to highlight the idea of the most modern civ in AoE2. If you pretend that the Spanish also represent the Portugese, you can also pretend that the Hand Cannoneers are actually using matchlock muskets which the Portugese are credited with transmitting to the Chinese and the Japanese, which would make them notable users of handheld projectile gunpowder weapons.

* TEAM BONUS: Trade units generate +33% gold

The Spanish received a ton of trade from North Africa and held contacts with the Middle East, animals, diseases, and people. Spain became rich from the trade and it's probably fitting that they get this bonus (remember, it affects Trade Cogs, too). Spain was given dibs on the New World by the Pope, while Portugal got the Old World (and a bit of South America that would be known as Brazil today) and those guys brought about a virtual end to the Silk Road opening the way for Europeans to get to Asia by going under Africa.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/wdhee/juego_contra_la_historicidad_dia_18_los/

**VIKING HISTORY**

The Vikings in AoE2 represent not just the very specific ""Vikings, whether pirates, raiders, merchants, or settlers were ""fara i viking,"" going on an expedition. Vikingrs are the men who go a viking. However, due to the fact that AoE2 is about empire building over a long period of time (think about a multiplayer game where you advance through all 4 ages), Harald Hardraade of Norway makes an appearance leading an army of Berserks, and land in Newfoundland

The actual Scandinavian countries are a big mystery during the Viking Age. There are scant runic inscriptions on stone and very few records exist from the actual political states. We know from the myths and artifacts of Germanic tribes south of the Scandinavians that they were related to groups such as the Goths and Saxons and especially to the Angles and Jutes. In fact, and Norway. Attila the Hun, whose Huns played an important role in the early history of many Germanic peoples, is a character in a few Norse Sagas. Eventually we begin to get a much brighter picture 
of the Scandinavian Kingdoms during the Middle Ages

One of the most important aspects of the Vikings that some people don't really remember is the fact that they were settlers. They were well-known for their raids and incursions, becoming the Normans (obviously, north men). The Normans then went on to conquer Sicily and southern Italy, and most famously they conquered England. A group of Norse known as the ""Rus"" became overlords of the Slavic population in Eastern Europe, and they eventually became the ""Russians."" Some Rus warriors were enlisted by the Byzantine Emperor to be his Varangian Guard, which led to some interesting correspondence between the Eastern Roman Emperor and his ""Vassal"" the Western Frankish Roman Emperor about their shared experiences with Scandinavian dudes from the North. The Kings of Norway and Denmark were occasionally Kings of England and parts of Scotland and Ireland.	

But of course their raids were infamous and for good reason. The Vikings sailed down rivers and on seas, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Greece, North Africa, and Armenia. The Viking way of war would be to ride swiftly down rivers on their boats in lighting quick raids. Many cities had to be next to rivers, and then retreat as quickly as they came.

The Vikings Christianized and were then participants in European feudalism, a collective of coastal or near coastal cities in Northern Europe formed in 1358 to protect against other polities and pirates. Member cities included Berlin in Germany, Krakow in Poland, Stockholm in Sweden, Bremen in Saxony, Novgorod in Russia, Bergen in Norway, and London in England. Each city would provide for the others' defense
Other important events in Scandinavia was the Kalmar Union, Denmark was clearly the self-designated leader and internal squabbling led to it's downfall.

So the Vikings are related to the Teutons and the Goths as a larger, the Byzantines, and maybe even some Persians. If you consider the Rus to be Viking, then they had conflict with the Mongols, too.

**VIKING BONUSES**

* Warships cost -20%

The Vikings are one of the most premier naval civilizations; in history, Saracens, Turks, Spanish, and Byzantines come close but the Vikings have a deeply ingrained maritime and militaristic culture. At least, to their enemies. The Saracens colonized and explored a territory just as far and wide as the Vikings, but their naval conflicts were not characterized by the same ""zealotry"" as their land conquests (which is probably because they won AND lost alot of battles at sea). The Japanese relied heavily on the sea, but did not have many overseas holdings. The Byzantines conquered, and it allows the Vikings to dominate the seas in the Feudal Age

* Infantry +10/15/20% HPs starting in Feudal Age

Vikings were renowned for their fury in battle, and it means that when you pit one Pikemen versus one Paladin they actually perform almost exactly the same or better than non-Japanese Halberdiers because their extra sliver of HP means they can get one more attack-bonused strike on their mounted enemies. It's not the same story when there's multiple Pikes fighting multiple Paladins though, because more Halbs means more attack bonuses being thrown around while multiple Pikes simply do not have the same damage output. It also means Viking Infantry perform better against Archers; that flash +4 attack from Garland Wars or the extra 25% faster attack speed doesn't mean anything if they die before reaching their enemies. Due to how high pierce armor is and how low Arbalest attack power is, it works out to be 17 arrows to kill a Viking Champ versus 14 on every other Champion. This is similar to how the Celtic Champs are better versus Archers due to their foot speed.

* Wheelbarrow

I'm not 100% sure about this tech. The main trait of the Viking's economic prowess in relation to everybody else was their ability to colonize other lands
Goths and you can pretend you're playing Mass Effect). Vikings were also really good traders, probably second to the Hunnic house bonus. I suppose you could say that if the Vikings were to go off and build a new base in another part of the world, like Normandy or Sicily or Byzantium or Iceland or Greenland, they'd be able to quickly create a strong economy in no time. The bonuses also mean that when you are in the Feudal and castle Age, you do not have to let up on the creation of Villagers, whereas other civs might have to stop creating Villagers for a short period to research Wheelbarrow and Hand Cart. This *might* be a reference to the fact that the Viking Age was a result of Scandinavia becoming overpopulated, as the Vikings were colonizers as well as raiders.

* TEAM BONUS: Docks cost -25%

A fairly broad bonus to the Viking Navy; not only does it mean that you have more Docks and you can create lots of ships faster (and cheaper thanks to the other bonus), Scandinavia probably does not have huge numbers of natural Docks, at least not more than other 
countries and one of the key advantages of the Viking Longboats were their ability to be easily beached without Docks. However all the ships in AoE seem to be easy to beach and we can't just have the Villagers build Ships out of thing air (well

**HUNNIC HISTORY

The Huns are, a nomadic people who invaded Europe from the East sometime in the 4th century, and lasted only until the 5th. After that, they were absorbed by waves of other invaders from the East.

The Huns were chosen as an expansion pack civilization by Ensemble Studios because they were Conquerors. Ensemble didn't want The Conquerors expansion to just be a Renassaince expansion. By including the Huns, ES had to exclude other Eastern European civs such as the Slavs and Magyars. Forgotten Empires, an fan Expansion created by AOCZone, has designed, developed, and tested their own Slav and Magyar civs. Anyhow, just quick thing about the Huns.

The Huns occupy a very interesting place in history like the other Central Asian civilizations in history because they were both in Europe and in Asia, they left behind very few traces of their existence. We know that they were a horse people of the Steppes. We just don't know if they were an Iranian people like the Scythians, or if they were a Turkic people like the Turks.

The group of Huns themselves probably weren't homogenous; they were most likely a confederation of various races, Alamanni, Scirii, Rugians, etc. The Huns had their own language, and we only know from a few simple words and the names of their Kings that they might have spoken a Turkic language. One of Attila's sons was named Dengizich, and his name had roots in a Turkic name from which the very infamous name ""Ghengis"" came. The Huns spoke the Goth language as a ""lingua franca, their subjects

As you might already know, occupied the area we now know as Ukraine, and the Huns came from that direction and attacked them, causing them to flee to the Roman Empire's borders. You could almost say that the Huns, if they didn't start them, accelerated the ""barbarian invasions"" into the Roman Empire.

Some scholars associate the Huns with the Xiognu,"" or at least it's equivalent, is invoked by the White Huns , an Iranian people who invaded India about a decade after the collapse of the Hunnic Empire in Europe.

I like to think that the Huns represent a whole swath of Eurasian Steppe peoples, after all, as well as Hussars. They also have access to Walls and Towers, something the Goths don't have.

The Huns are related to the Turks and Mongols, Franks, Goths, people similar to the Vikings, Britons, and Teutons, and may have fought with the Chinese.

**HUNS AND THEY BONUSES HOME BOI**

* Don't need Houses

The main bonus that makes the Huns who the Huns are. It's a truly nomadic bonus. Not *quite* historically accurate for the semi-nomadic Huns, Stables, etc. The Asian Steppe Peoples used big, portable tents called Yurts (and you can see them in AoE2). These Yurts would have walls and ceilings made of straw or hide pieced together to form a sheet, and then wooden logs would form the support columns and beams for the sheets. It was a simple matter of folding the sheets up and bringing down the logs and then putting them in a horse drawn wagon and moving, then doing the reverse when you needed to camp. Hunnic armies, however, and would switch mounts when one of them would get tired. They'd cut their horses and drink their blood while on the ride

* Cavalry Archers cost -25%/30% starting in Castle Age

The majority of Hunnic armies were Cavalry Archers, even moreso for back then. A steppe rider was smaller and easier for their horses to carry! The Huns used a composite bow, probably among the first to be used in large numbers in Europe. Composite bows are made of a combination of wood, animal bone, and animal hide, with fats and tree sap used to glue the materials together. The result is a bow that is very, very resilient and allows for a very strong draw, so you pretty much have no reason to use Crossbowmen or Arbalests. This is accurate since the vast majority of Hun armies were mounted.

* Trebuchets +30% Accuracy

I'm not sure why the Huns get this bonus. They were really good at sacking and destroying cities, the Treb is supposed to be a common siege weapon for all civs, so taking it away from a civ would be kind of bad but giving a civ a bonus for something they didn't use is really weird. The Huns definitely used Roman siege weapons; they had a Battering Ram when they attacked Utus in the Balkans, and catapults and ballista when they could procure them intact.

* TEAM BONUS: Stables work +20% faster

Another cavalry bonus. This ensures that a Hun player will use both the Cavalry Archers AND their Stable units. The Huns in particular used lots of light cavalry, and thus they could be credited for the dominance of heavy cavalry during the middle ages.

**HOLLA HOLLA THE THE HUN TECH TREE PLAYA**

* UNIQUE UNIT: Tarkan

When the developers created the Tarkan, and run out. The reality is not so great. In actual gameplay, the Tarkan attack a bit slower than other units: something like 1 per 2.14 seconds. Most other units do 1 every 2 seconds or less.  Because of the slow attack, a group of Tarkans end up doing the same damage to most buildings as an equal number Knights, but they falter in combat due to their lower attack and speed. One thing that they ARE good at is destroying Castles, and they do so significantly faster than Knights. Don't try to use them on Bombard Towers though. Let's analyze them historically. If you look closely, the Tarkans are primed for raiding. They are armed with torches (which would explain their lack of battle prowess, they have high HPs and pierce armor, the Gothic Huskarls; Huskarls have extremely high piece armor instead of extremely high HP, so that kind of goes out the window.

    sacrifice.

* OH MAN WASN'T THAT HILARIOUS!?

* Mexicans are the most mentally tough people on the planet. They eat beans and rice every goddamn day and don't want to kill themselves.

* Actually what's quite interesting is that most civilizations subsist on some sort of grain + bean combo. Medieval Europeans and Mediterranean dudes would do bread and fava beans, and in ancient Mexico it was actually black beans and corn, while down in South America the staple was amaranth and quiche and potatoes. Heck the Chinese have been doing the rice and beans thing longer than anybody else.

I'm principally the overall designer

AI Scripters


Map Designers

Voice Actors

Writers/Historians

Trigger Editor

Playtesters (eventually)

I basically need EVERYTHING.

I plan on using Skype or something occasionally for design meetings and stuff.

The campaign is going to be like the ES campaigns on steroids. Better map design, more triggers, etc. But the general focus will be on build and destroy with one fixed force scenario just like in the campaigns.

There's a [MacBeth campaign at aokheaven](http://aok.heavengames.com/blacksmith/showfile.php?fileid=7523&amp;ci=9958a3ed8b30eb2431ec117d7ae376c1YToxOntpOjA7YToyOntpOjA7czoxNDoiU2VhcmNoIFJlc3VsdHMiO2k6MTtzOjM3OiJsaXN0ZXIucGhwP3N0YXJ0PTAmYW1wO3NlYXJjaD1tYWNiZXRoIjt9fQ==) that I thought was genius as well as a [Mayan campaign that was good](http://aok.heavengames.com/blacksmith/showfile.php?fileid=693&amp;ci=3d276a49e7d332eeb4c35d5e3107b617YToxOntpOjA7YToyOntpOjA7czoxNDoiU2VhcmNoIFJlc3VsdHMiO2k6MTtzOjM2OiJsaXN0ZXIucGhwP3N0YXJ0PTQwJmFtcDtzZWFyY2g9bWF5YW4iO319) about a semi-fictional Toltec invasion and they have most of the elements of a build up and destroy. So if you've played those

The campaign will be called ""Sapa Inca

**Outline of the Campaign**

* The first scenario will feature Viracocha and Pachacuti fighting the Chancas. The scenario will start with the player defending Cusco from the Chancas and then he will have to evacuate Viracocha off the map. The second leg will feature Viracocha's son Pachacuti arriving with an army to retake Cusco. He might even have to sneak into the city in a semi-fixed force section. The third section will have you build up Cuscos' defenses as well an army for an eventual invasion of Chanca land.

* The second scenario will be a semi-fictional pure build and destroy and feature the player as Tupac Inca Yupanqui defending Cusco from 4 diverse enemies kind of like the first Barbarossa and Montezuma missions: the Anti, and the Nazca. I had a silly idea to make the Chimu Saracens who would use huge llamas in battle (Mamelukes or...get this...LLAMALUKES), and the Middle Eastern set works as a stand in for Chimu architecture. The Anti would be Aztecs, the Aymara would be Mayans, and the Nazca would be Inca.

I'm going to scrap it but this is what I intended for the second scenario to look like:

https://docs.google.com/file/d/0By9K2ql9Dei5SmJ1a3FoTnh6dTA/edit?usp=sharing

Also Tupac will speak like 2Pac

* The third scenario would be about Tupac attempting to consolidate the mainland area and capture a number of cities before attacking the Chimor capital of Chan Chan. The player must compete with Chimor to capture 6 cities: Quito, and a few others that I haven't decided upon yet. Certain cities will have different objectives. For instance, the player will have to build a Wonder in Quito far to the north but they might have to destroy a Chimor built Wonder there first.

* Fourth scenario will be the Battle of the Maule River against the Mapuche. Tupac will be present in the battle as well as his son and successor Huayna Capac who was born in Tomebamba a couple decades ago. I'm thinking it should be sort of a Black Forest type mission except with jungle trees and mountains and stuff instead. I'm not sure exactly how it will play out yet.

* The fifth scenario will be an invasion of the city of Chan Chan, whose combat skills have diminished, and Huayna as Hero units. Once the player finishes that conquest one of the generals of Chan Chan, Biggansmallcan, will flee to the Galapagos Islands and the player will have to give chase in a naval battle. This would represent Tupac's legendary sea voyage in the Pacific.

* The final scenario will feature Huayna Capac in the final year of his rule. He dies pretty early in the scenario and his two squabbling sons take control of the throne.

1370224341.0,1fjyt7,Battle For Manchuria,Wolfpony,27,1,10,"It's cool to post text-based battle reports

A quick disclaimer; I'm ok at this game

Four-way match, up against the Teutons (blue), Goths (yellow), and the Britons (red). I start deep in Manchuria, in the westernmost point on the map. I start doing all the usual early game stuff, and begin exploring. As I do, I realise something - I'm the only one on the mainland. The other three players are all in Japan. Here is where I make one of my bad judgement calls: I should have taken a more active roll in the fighting

An hour and a half into the game, but it is still pretty intense. (I later found out that the Goths in the north and the Britons in the south had both tried to Drush the Teutons, and their rushes had kinda...met).

Fast forward another half hour, infinite gold (so to speak), and heaps of resources. At this point I'm considering building a wonder, just for the hell of it. This smugness wouldn't last long. While the other three still had plenty of resources, they had used a bit of foresight and realised that they wouldn't last forever. So they started talking to each other, and they came up with a cunning plan. They turned allied victory off and became allies, with the aim of joint defeating me, before resuming hostilities. They had made their own Nazi-Soviet Pact

The first battle is, and I have plenty of wood, so this battle is rather fierce. Eventually, however, my navy is destroyed and most of my docks blown up. I still have one left, located below Korea, and the remnants of my navy retreats to defend it. Here is another potential bad judgement call. I probably had enough wood to rebuild my navy and go on the offensive. But I might not have, I was relying on farms for food. I decided not to rebuild it

As that battle ended, but this battle proved their worth. They were maneuverable enough to get behind the British Lbows and other archers and destroy them, while my halbs and plumed archers defeated the cavalry/infantry attacks. This Battle raged on-and-off for a while, and finally ended when the enemy resources ran too low for them to continue.

Then the third battle began - the invasion of Japan. I sent my transport fleet, below the Britons. The landing is almost unapposed, and resistance in Briton's town is mediocre. I destroy his base and set up a small one of my own, even stealing some of his buildings. Then I move up to attack the Teutons. The fighting is heavier here, but still lighter than I expected. Their attacks are often hit-and-run, and they seem to be targeting my more expensive units, such as monks and trebs. There are Goths and Britons mingled amongst the Teuton attacks. I decide not to pursue them, and I finally understand why resistance was so light. All three of them had gathered their armies to defend the Goths. I assumed they had turned allied victory back on. Fighting is heavy, and blow up the Gothic town. They surrender

FYI villagers delete what they are carrying if you switch them to a different resource type (even from sheep to boar)

basically it seems if you get vills to gather something then they make a mining camp/lumbercamp or even farm/TC they still ""bank"" those resources instead of deleting them

no wonder I find booming so fucking tedious I've been making each villie drop his wood before building each farm this whole time.

Knowing this little fact is going to make this game insanely easier to play and I thought I would post because I'm curious if I'm the only one who didn't know about this feature (bug?).",self,t5_2sg7u,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1k24xn/so_my_mind_just_got_blown_watching_a_pro_play/

Age of Empires II: HD happened because a lot of people wanted to keep that dream alive. The technology has moved forward - operating systems change, there I was - just me and the wonder against 4 other guys."" often sadly followed by ""I miss that game, I wish I could still play it"". Not game stories after all, but human stories- about friends and family, victory and defeat - and learning about ancient cultures as a nice side benefit.

It deserved a second chance.

Because a few people were still keeping the dream alive, YouTube and Netflix hadn't been invented yet.

The fundamental libraries that the game was built on no longer existed

It was Summer 2012 - Microsoft said 'let's go bigger - what would you do?' - we felt that we really needed to fully support larger resolutions and wide screen - both full screen and in-window play (which meant re-authoring all of the game interfaces; we also sweetened the colors and retouched them for modern monitors and graphics cards). We wanted to definitely keep things compatible with the fan levels and content that had been created over the years

There was a much longer wish list but it was pared down by the realities of the schedule and the game assets that could still be found (we had to extract language files from shipping disks and rebuild it to get all of the localized text

I'm so proud of what we've created together with Microsoft - it *is* in every way Age of Kings and The Conquerors. It wasn't re-interpreted, Steam Workshop and multi-monitor support) added to the experience.

We had a great team here at HPE working on the game - a really incredible effort

1365993989.0,1cd5wi,Idea for AOE mod,AOEserf,27,2,23,"So my friends and I were discussing aspects about aoe which

Our idea was to have a mod that allows each civ a total number of units for the whole game. So if that limit was 500

This is to address the frequently used tactic of spamming units for any given task. 

I want to discuss the pros and cons of this.

The pros:
This tactic still calls for a lot of strategy and provides a reasonable proxy of attrition warfare. It targets economy and pure tenacity as requisites for victory. Keep pouring enough army into a town and choke their Econ,

The cons: 
I feel it allows for sloppy gameplay

This got us to thinking.  In real life, you lose the war. In aoe, so long as you have stockpiles of Econ, you can come back from one villager.

What if, you are only allowed to create 500 (or some other arbitrary number) units for the entire duration of the game. 

You would play slower, say, the franks.

Sounds like an easy mod and could create a fascinating dynamic. I can see sieges being more effective... Is it really worth losing 80 troops tearing down a wall and castle if I could just starve them out instead?

It would eliminate huskarl rushes entirely. It'd cause you to be more thoughtful with Econ instead of just spamming villagers because every vil is one less military unit.

What do you think reddit?

Tldr: A total game pop limit. Meaning you can have only X population for the whole game.

1365306931.0,1bu3bt,For those of you who can't get AoE II: HD to launch:,Delta-62,25,4,3,"1. Try opening the Launcher.exe directly from the AoE folder in steamapps(right click the game in Steam

2.  If it says you're missing mfc110.dll that means you need to update your Visual C++ runtime. There should be a copy of the installation files within the folder under _CommonRedist.

3. If reinstalling Visual Studio 2012 (what you need!) wont work because of an access restriction(see the error code) 

4. Now execute the vcredist_x86.exe and vcredist_x64.exe found in c:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Age2HD_CommonRedist\vcredist\2012 

5. Relaunch to test if it works

**If the VC redistributable installation fails:**

1. Open command prompt and run the following commands

   Re-initializing the windows installer engine:

    `Msiexec /unregister`
   
    `Msiexec /regserver`

 Do these if you have a 64-bit copy of Windows:

    `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\msiexec.exe \unregister`

    `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\msiexec.exe \regserver`

2. Check the permissions on the following folders:
`C:\Windows\winsxs  `  
`C:\Windows\winsxs\InstallTemp`  
“SYSTEM” should have full permissions and
“TrustedInstaller” should have full permissions.  

**NOTE:**  
Please make sure you are running the latest service pack of your edition of windows. It took me hours of troubleshooting to realize it wouldn't work for me because I had SP1 instead of SP2

**Here are the required operating systems for VC++ Redistributable:.**  

- Windows 7 SP1 (x86 and x64)  

- Windows 8 (x86 and x64)
- Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 (x64)
 
- Windows Server 2008 SP2 (x64)
- Windows Vista SP2 (x86 and x64)

- Multiple Montior Support (play AOE on two montiors) http://i.imgur.com/Ylb2aeE.png
- New anticheat patch. It has been totally re-built and now unlocks widescreen for non-premium and enables AoFE to have rated games.
- Rated AOFE! Cysion and Voobly developers worked together for the past few months to get this accomplished. Thanks guys!
- Widescreen for everyone on both rated and unrated games.
- NAT 2.0 http://i.imgur.com/K7rLTuN.png
- Live Streaming linked to the lobby (released a few months ago)

The Voobly developers have been working for months on a lot of these new features. I've been playing AOE since 1998 and I can honestly say in terms of new features this is the best year since then.

-----------------------------------------

Edit:  As many of you know

- The new anticheat has been in development for the last 3 1/2 months coinciding with the AOFE release.
- Multi Monitor support and widescreen both were added with the incorporation of AOFE....3 1/2 months.
- Widescreen previously had a backdoor hack vulnerability with the old anti cheat.  The new anticheat fixes this....3/12 months.
- NAT 2.0 was released February 2
- Live Streaming linking to account and lobby were added January 5

1375022484.0,1j7st2,Archer flush: Britons vs Mayans; optimal initial attack time,Philanthrapist,25,3,15,"Hello!

Britons have for long been my favorite civilization because of their archers, now with Mayans I'm having difficulty archer flushing.

With the Britons I had two main build orders: 

* 20pop feudal archer spam flush - 8 archers in the enemy base @16:15 with Fletching

This BO was incredibly badass. 8 archers @16:15 **with a 600 gold buffer** ready. With this BO I built a second archery range @17:00-17:30 and pumped out archers from both and didn't even halt my villager production at all

* 28pop fast castle/crossbowmen - 8 crossbowmen in the enemy base @18:50 with Fletching

This was the more high risk high reward BO. If my base was left untouched, +2 attack up on archers.

Now, although I could get castle age by 21:00-22:00 with this flush. I don't see the point of a fast castle age either... I mean I can't get Plumed archers out fast enough, I lack Knights, and the Mayan crossbowmen are mediocre. A fast-imp is out of the question for the setting that I always play, which is tiny Arabia 1v1.

So the match I had yesterday was a 2v2 on random land map although it came out much like Arabia. My ally was Huns (I think). My all was against Aztecs (red) and I was against some other guy that didn't use his UU (blue). I'm trying out a new strategy with Mongols

My start-up went well, I kill 2 villagers and move on before its built. Get quite a few villager kills but then get overrun by I think a couple of knights and a bunch of spearmen. I run off to Aztec instead and get a couple of kills there too but they all get killed. At home I'm booming hard. 3 TCs never idle.

Bit of a lull while I'm building up and I think by this stage my ally is getting pounded. He's all beacons and saying ""eagle warriors"" in chat. I say ""are you ok?"" and he says ""no"". Give a hell. I get attacked by my guy. 4 villagers

Aztecs is still making eagle warriors (possibly to counter my mangudai which I'm raiding his villagers with but he's also getting squads of jaguar warriors which are taking on my champs well and he has loads of castles in his base. He's also fully rebuilt his main base and villagers.  We have lots of battles all across the map with my champs and mangudais usually coming out on top. But when I push to his base I get mullered by TCs and castles. My guy comes hard (not). he builds 3 towers in range of my archery range and some knights or crap. I destroy the towers with trebs and then send 40 champs to his base. They made short work of his 2-handed swordsmen. 11. I destroy everything I can see and he's proper boned now

1375385657.0,1jijeq,[BO] Mayans Fast Castle for pockets - 17:30 Castle,Philanthrapist,21,2,18,"**Edit: This is NOT a 17:30 castle *age* - it's a 17:30 finished castle (the building).**

Hello!

I'd like to share one of my build orders for Mayans for pocket-positions. Since Plumed Archers are so cheap and fast they make for excellent hit-n-run economy raiding units

What you will need: 8 sheep

What you will get: A castle and one extra town center @ 17:30 with enough resources to start producing Plumed Archers without any idle time.

Here it goes:

~~------------------------------------------------------------------~~

**Dark Age**:

* Hit Loom
* Build two houses with your 4 idle villagers. 2/2 or 3/1 depending on their starting positions
* Once Loom is finished start producing villagers immediately. Put the first 2 produced villagers
* Put the next 4 on wood
* The next villager goes to build a Mill next to deer
* The next villager goes to build a house and lure boar
* The 6 shepherds -without the lurer- start boar collecting. Don't forget to send one of these 6 to lure the next boar once this one is low enough. Once both boars are finished let them go back to doing sheep
* Let the next 2 villagers join the villager who built a Mill next to deer
* The next villager creates a farm
* The next villager goes wood-chopping
* The next villager builds a house and creates a farm
* The next villager goes wood-chopping
* The next villager creates a farm
* The next 2 villagers create a mining camp next to gold and mine gold
* The next 3 villagers create a mining camp next to stone and mine stone. Don't forget to build a house with one of these three before you hit Feudal age
* Click Feudal upgrade (25 pop)

So far you have: 6 shepherds/boar hunters, 2 gold-miners, 3 stone-miners

**Feudal age**:

* Start producing 2 villagers
* Your 3 deer hunters should be finished with the three deer for some time already, all 3 go to mine stone
* Click Castle upgrade (27 pop)
* Once your 6 shepherds are done with the sheep it's up to you what you do with them. Observe, feel free to split them however you please. If you want a forward castle, you can send a few of them forward. I would recommend putting at least two of them on gold.
* Regulate your stone miners; send them to other resources if you know you'll have the 750 stone by Castle age

**Castle age**:

* Build a Castle (with multiple villagers

~~------------------------------------------------------------------~~

This BO is not one I use particularly often, such as stealing enemy boars. It is not fully polished either - I would guess it could be done with a 24 pop Feudal to give an earlier Castle time, but I just haven't tried it yet.

There is no other way. Sorry. I don't think a human player is capable of surviving against 7 AI on hardest through any honest tactics. 

Notes on the match:

* 7 AI (The Horde I believe
* 200 Pop limit
* Regicide (I wanted a quick end either way)
* Post-Imp
* Coastal map
* 'Aegis' turned on from the beginning. Wanted to see the worst case scenario
* AI rushed me within 30 seconds. I barely had 30 or so cars out to hold off the first onslaught. 
* Spammed cars
* Decided not to make more than 100 cars, so it was in my interest to finish the game quickly.
* Took 30 cars and went on a roving trip from civ to civ
* Every single civ was more difficult to defeat than the last. First batch of 30 cars were completely demolished by the 3^rd civ's king's death. Had to retake 30 more from my stock of 70 for the next mission. 
* That lasted for 2 more civs. Final bunch of 30 with only 10 defending my home base took care of the last two. 
* Total match time - 27 minutes. I was sure if the match had gone on 5 more minutes longer I would have been toast.
* Total units killed ~ 1800, units lost ~ 72

It was a lot of fun and a good way to test out the 60 FPS. I know this was not a serious game

I plan on playing a lot of games with people that are on the same level as I am and the most crowded platform will probably offer the most noobs. 
- Is it normal for a multiplayer game to play with a civ of your choice or is it normal to get a random civ? What about games with teams
- If it is 'allowed' to choose your own civ
- What speed should I be playing at? I always used to play on 'fast'
- I've found AoCzone and AoKheaven
- I've been reading up a little about the differences between each civ
- What's the deal with Forgotten Empires? It's great the community made it of course

Chinese Scorpions are best in game IMO thanks to their Unique Tech, all techs are cheaper to research for Chinese, so you can get to that point even faster. Unfortunately, Chinese lack Siege Engineers so they miss out on the +1 range which is very important for Scorpions.

Celts would be a close match, Celts can't ALWAYS have better siege :( Admittedly, they most likely do, but the damage output of Chinese Scorpions is just an amazing feeling &gt;:)",,False,self,1371359293.0,t3_1geb34

Start by building two houses with your starting vils and put all subsequent vils on sheep or boars. Do not build a mill or a lumber camp. The goal here is to pump out 14 vils as fast as possible. You can try this strat with more but I think it's too slow, send your entire team towards the enemy. While they are walking, research loom at the TC then delete it.

Rebuild the TC to the south of the enemy's TC and within firing range. Since vils exit the TC to the south by default, micro your squad so that some of them ward off the attackers while the others continue building. Once the TC is up, ring the bell, pick off anything that moves, then start pelting the enemy TC with arrows. Since your TC has double HP, this is a duel you are bound to win.

I have always been under the impression that Cataphracts are usually an inferior choice to paladins (which the Byzantines have) since they have 10 less health, but paladins do plenty of damage against these units anyways. The only benefit I can see would be against spearmen, but even then, why would you be running cavalry against them? Use cavalry archers or hand-cannoneers or champions etc.

A mill costs 100 wood.

A farm costs 60 wood and gives 175 food (dark age). The equivalent cost of a mill is 1.67 farms so as long as you get 1.67x the amount of food then you're quids in (in terms of wood). 1.67 x 175 food = 292 food.

A deer provides 140 food. Call it 130 with rotting.

4 deer provide 4 x 130 food = 520 food.

Hunting is quicker than farming but villagers will have to walk to the deer - so probably about equal. An advantage is you can put 3 villagers per deer rather than 1 villager per farm. Good for the high food demands of feudal and castle upgrades.

I played a 2v2 game recently (cheats were disabled) and I got to the feudal age the same time as my opponents.  We all had a score of around 700-1000.  The guy with 1000 score kept going up and up in score really fast.  He had 1500 by the time I had 900.  He was all over my villagers with Scout Cavalry.  He suffocated my base

My biggest question is how did his score get so much higher than mine before any combat took place?  Again

Is it possible he cheated somehow?  I don't see how anyone could be THAT good.

I hope you enjoy. Unfortunately I don't have a recording. Just forgot to tick the button this time.

So yesterday I spent a bit of time learning a build order for an Aztec Dark Rush. Aztecs because the free loom means 5 militia. So this story is about my first attempt at it online.

The matchup was a 2v2 with my friend CocaCola on Arabia. He was Huns, 4 on wood then as much food as I can get. the 13th vill gets 2 houses and the barracks. I scouted my guy early and found his berries but no wood, so anyway I attacked with 5 militia and the EW and the first thing I found was a little forward at the front of his base; A lumber camp and a barracks. I was expecting counter militia but none came out. I killed 1 or 2 villagers on wood but damn are militia slow at killing things! He ran. Then I went to berries where there were literally 10... Got maybe 1 or 2 more kills and a few hits and he runs home. I find he's mining gold and stone (nothing intensive) and chopping nearby wood with the EW and I just harass him where I can. 
 
By now I probably have 28  villagers and I had enough on farms and deer to get the feudal upgrade. I take 2 deer villagers (they were forward anyway) to his base. The others back on wood. I feudal and get 2 ranges up, 4 archers, and a couple of spears. Plus more archers all the time. He has ranges and stables and a few units but I have too many and he can't get a foothold. I've got a butt load of gold coz I left my TC rally point on gold but really short on everything else. I get a few more farms and eventually have the 800 food to castle. I'm getting mad kills with my archers/skirms. And the skirms can really take some TC punishment too. He's surely got nothing left...
 
I castle and build a siege workshop and a 2nd TC. He castles... WTF?! I could not believe my eyes. How did he have the food
 
My first gold dries up with like 20 villagers on it. Forgot to change the rally point! So I get them to build a 3rd TC on a new gold. Garrisoning protects most my villagers but he gets a few kills. My forward villagers build 2 barracks and I get out pikeman. I manage to get 8-10 and 3-4 Eagle Warriors from the barracks in my base. He gets a few cav archers so I get skirmishers too (still have those 2 forward ranges). Earlier I managed to sneak out my ram while the knights were attacking the workshop and I hid that behind my Pikes and Skirms. I build another siege workshop and 1 more ram. Red quits from CocaCola's attack. Nice one! I attack with rams.
 
The knights and cav archers come but since the rams are the targets I can protect them with the pikes and he can't really run away. He says ""gg"" and ""you guys are really good"" and quits.
 
The map reveals and he DOESN'T have a 2nd hidden base or anything. How the hell did he castle and get knights? Red was shite

In any equally divided game of 4 or more players, though any units or buildings not near their original town can be attacked.

We have played this format over and over again and few people want to go back to conventional random maps. It allows unexperienced players to hold their city

The format is played in conquest mode so that supporters can't build wonders and gather relics while they can't be attacked.

The format is insanely fun and eliminates the powerless position many new players experience.

If you have any questions or comments about my new format let me know. There is still a lot of gray area and situations that could result in new rules.

One con that I can think of is getting unlucky with random civilizations. In one game my team got dominated by Mongols, and Saracens while we were playing as Vikings, Goths, Mayans, and Huns. We were absolutely outgunned in the late game, and the format discourages rushing by nature.

What I'd like is to create a group of similar ""intermediate players"" so its easy to find matchups with people who are your same ability. Then you can get to know how good players are. The sort of level I mean is this. You can:

* Consistently get to castle age by 18-20 minutes (if you want).

* Rush or defend a rush in the Feudal age.

* Counter all unit types effectively.

* Attack effectively in early castle with knights or similar.

***Game Details***

Here is what I am thinking for game settings
&gt;* Version: AoE2 HD
&gt;* Random Land Map 1v1
&gt;* Size: Tiny (2 player)
&gt;* Resources: Standard
&gt;* Population: 200
&gt;* Reveal map: Normal
&gt;* Game Speed: Normal
&gt;* Starting Age: Standard
&gt;* Victory: Standard

***Competition Format***

&gt;[Swiss style tournament](http://challonge.blogspot.com/2013/01/swiss-tournaments.html)
&gt;
&gt;Players are given their pairings and will determine their own game time
&gt;
&gt;Win: 1 pt
&gt;
&gt;Bye (there will be a few): 1pt
&gt;
&gt;Loss: 0pts
&gt;
&gt;Tie (only used when results are not reported and holding up the tournament): 0pts


In terms of competition format, a tie for 1st place is very possible. They have a tie-break system for this situation built in the website which is basically strength of schedule. So if two people are tied for first, they add up the scores of each of the two players' opponents, and whoever had the stronger schedule is named champion. 

I suggest this tie breaking method:
If after all rounds are played, a round robin will be played. I think this is better than just naming a winner based on opponent strength. *Please let me know what you think.*

***Tournament Start Date and Length***

Let me know when you guys would like to get going. I think we should allow the rest of this weekend to get people signed up, but we can do more. *Again, I need input on how many rounds you would like to play.* I estimate a round taking about 3-4 days to complete. 

I know this is a lot of info

1365897811.0,1caqlu,Streamlined Hotkeys,banthur,17,3,3,"I have been working on an experimental set of easier to use hotkeys for AOE2. The basic idea is to make common tasks easier to perform.  

Here is a google doc showing the current iteration:  
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AlIy3ctG3WzbdDVWNUQyX29vcEZ6VERYZ0lKWHJiNEE&amp;output=html

The way this is laid out it is designed for heavy use of the ""Select Next ... "" keys and your hand will sit on the left half of the keyboard.  

Regular commands are on QWERT/ASDFG/ZXCVB
Select Next are on YU/HJ/NM  

[ QWERT ] [YU]  
[ ASDFG ] [HJ]  
[ ZXCVB ] [NM]  

This breaks the layout into two halves. Since multiple building select doesn't work too well in this game the layout is designed to optimize alternating hotkeys to spam unit production.  

For instance, the place your hand will naturally lay if your index finger hits Y. This means to macro out a bunch of milita you can hit Y-W-Y-W-Y-W and this for most gamers should come out extremely quick.  

The same holds for the other 5 buildings in the Select Next .. block. Archery range is H and its units are on SDFG. And so on. It might take some adjusting to use this setup but it should streamline macro'ing out units quite a bit.

As far as the building hotkeys V and B are build military/economic respectively and the more frequently used buildings are clustered closer to those keys. Some buildings kind of got shafted here although this is due to military and economic buildings sharing the same hotkey set (!!). For instance barracks and lumber camp can't have the same hotkey despite the fact that it's impossible to hit the barracks hotkey from the build economic page. Ah well.  

I'd appreciate feedback anyone has on how to improve these.

1365542897.0,1c0mv8,"Posts about Persians, Teutons, Koreans...",Pr0xym4n,15,8, so sorry for don't recalling all exact names).

The main problem was the big number of enemies with a good amount of health and attack stacked at one place.

I thought I could share my tactics and experiences.

First my main point:
If an opponent can built 50 war elefants and without you being able to see it coming and make the preparations

What to do:
- Scouting from beginning to the end. 
If you cannot get inside his base:
- Poke and focus his attention

Don't focus on making a biiiig army and then a final battle with all the units. This will most certanly not work against power units.

Ok but the question was

There are a couple of things you can do

- Know your enemie and his disadvantages
-- war elephants &lt;-&gt; monks
-- against the korean battlewagon also pike
...search the web or the original handbook (hrhr) there are lists with all units and their counters

- know that counter doesn't mean stronger!
A war couple elephant can pick apart a big amount of piks
Your advantage is the following: cheaper units =&gt; many units
Spam them
But don't send them in 1 by 1. Attack in groups.

- use your brain!
He uses slow units stacked together at one place?
Onagers will do damage. 
But think about their usage! Are there Paladins or scouts that can pick them apart?
Combine them with a regular attack!

- counter attack him! 
His focus needs to get away from his units!


Overall:
1) Try to prevent such events ;)
2) If he/she/it manages to put together such an army and can attack you
3) Work on your knowledge about units
4) enjoy the game!

Not having allied vision kind of sucks because you feel very alone

If they could share vision then I feel like people wouldn't give up so early since they can see if perhaps their allies are doing well

Suggestions would be cool. Ideas that I have include:

Free cartography at feudal upgrade

Option in game setup for 'share allied vision'

Only one player needs to research cartography for all to benefit?

*Introduction:
So this game happened years back when microsoft still hosted online matches. It was the first online match i had played and it was the match that made me love AOE2. I am not the absolute best storyteller and there are parts that are hazy but i know a lot of it.

*Game setup Map - Nomad resources - high map size - giant players -8 (all vs all) my civ - Huns win type - conquest only my personal play style - Defender/Economy

**Game start - As this was my first play online I clicked on the first visible villager and immediately built a town center and started the game per usual. ( i was located in the North east corner of the map

**Me being a defense oriented player I immediately built a wall blocking off that single path entrance. I made my way to castle age without any player sightings... odd I thought... but maybe they were being defensive like me. I was sitting on about 150ish villagers at the time mostly farming and I would sell the food at the market for gold. I decided to ""up"" my defense

**Once this was done I was starting to get bored... I had no enemies

**one of the remaining players must have been trying to be smart and go around the carnage in the center of the map, and pikes. As soon as they came in range of my towers and bombard towers they were dead... they had no long range units and they weren't expecting there to be a wall of towers.

**This is where the game got pretty interesting for me at least. The guy who had his troops destroyed by me must have gotten a nice look at my city and how well fortified it was
So 10 or 15 minutes later all of the sudden comes 4 full armies into my view... ""o fucking fuckshit"" Immediately turned to my seige buildings (I had a lot of them) and started pumping out scorpions... within 2 minutes I had over 50-60 scorpions and put them right near the enterence of my military camp and the only way into my land. All the while I am still pumping out scorpions. The enemies armies are now ""at my doorstep"" and having a massive number of scorpions really helps cut down enemies lickety split. I also started making the bomb guys... ( i can't remember their name) and the push cannon-ers. I think the part that ""saved me"" was that these 4 armies and 4 players were still tech. enemies. Once my troops started cutting theirs apart and they lost control over the entire group of soldiers their own troops started fighting among each other.

**In the course of 10 ish minutes their armies were either killed by my towers or troops as well as fighting each other in a massive ""moshpit"" of death. This was very exciting for me personally because when I seen their armies I thought i was done. Instead now I was sitting with a full army and tons of extra resources from never fighting before this point and they were sitting on limited resources and no armies... I had and armyyy they had defenseless lands... of course I selected all my military buildings and started mass producing soldiers. Taking the army I had from the last fight I swung it like a fist right into the first city I came to. These guys had zero time to start rebuilding their army so they were finished in probably under a minute.

**I like to think of the visual of my troops leaving my city like a swarm
the second city I came to was probably just as easy as the first outside of the fact they had some troops. essentially just picture tons of bomber units all over the screen just blowing up absolutely everything they could get to.

**the last two players were smarter and started banding together as well as sent a few villagers to run to corners of the map to try to rebuild. at this point I was starting to run lower on troops cause I used mostly bomber units to take out city 2. so my attack came a little later and I met a strategy much like my own. That is that they used a lot of long range units to try to cut me down. This worked for a little but ultimately failed. I destroyed their cities and every villager I could find... But both of them were still in the game... weird...
So I decided to rebuild my army and scout. I found them... They had holed up in a small walled area that they had just made town center for each as well as a castle and a few houses. each of them had about 15 units left. I rebuilt my army really quickly with trebuchets (sp) and calvery archers and so on and all as a group approached the hold.

**Upon making it to the hold one of the two remaining players ragequit. just boom resigned the game. now there was one guy left... with his 15 men and 1 castel and small little hold against most of my population limit in military units. Instead of smashing him.. I built a wall and towers around his hold so that if any of his units set one foot outside of the space he had they would get shot. at the time I thought this was hilarious

**I do admire this dude though... He knew he was beat and he knew he was screwed but he fought right up until the end of the game unlike the guy that ragequit.
That is the match that made me love this game, with a small force of the other players men facing down a giant at their doorstep.",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1369098260.0,,

***Rules***

**Settings**: The settings listed above are intended as a default. If the two players would like to play with different settings

**Civilizations**: The choice of how to pick civilizations will be up to the individual players, or use the same civ. If an agreement cannot be reached on how to set the civilizations, there will be a default civilization for each round that each player must play. This does not mean you can force the other player to use the default if you don't like their civ. If you agree to pick civs, you must stick to that. The default civilization for Round 1 is **Huns**. 

**Reporting results (recently updated)** : One of the players must send a screenshot of the end game screen showing the victory to me by email (jakedgaoe@gmail.com). This will be loosely enforced for the first round as everyone gets in the flow of things. I think this is the easiest way to verify the game result. 

***

***Tournament  Format***

[Swiss style tournament](http://challonge.blogspot.com/2013/01/swiss-tournaments.html)

**Number of rounds: 8**. This means you will have 8 guaranteed games.

We're using ""xOmicron's user patch 1.1"" which allows you to set the population limit up to 1, it's really difficult to take full advantage of the larger pop limit when attacking as the groups you can make (highlight troops, press ctrl+1/2/3 etc.) are limited at 30/40 (I can’t remember which) units like they always have been.

Is there a way to allow you to group larger numbers of units to allow for the fact that you can now have much larger armies?

**EDIT :** I spoke to xOmicron yesterday and asked him about the possibility of increasing the population limit. He said ""The group size is currently 40 units.

&gt;Effect0: change object attack (-2 to unit)

&gt;Effect1: change object HP (-10 to unit)

&gt;Effect2: activate trigger (previous trigger)

Basically, then activates trigger2.  Trigger 2 waits 10 seconds and removes the bonuses, then reactivates trigger1.

In practice

Is there a better way to do this part?

There's a lot of clunkiness in the interface - it's all pretty dated, going back to AOE2:HD is like returning to the stone age.

Age of Empires Online had a lot of faults on launch. PVP matchmaking wasn't even in for a few patches

Over the months though

There are a lot of things I'm liking a lot more in AOEO:

Interface improvements:

* Infinite unit selection
* Multiple building selection
* Attack-move (yeah)
* Better pathfinding
 - Flow-field
 - Clustering
* Faster pathfinding
* Better target selection AI
* Military quick select

Game design changes:

* Infinite duration farm (AOE3 did this right)
* Revised balance model
* Better siege AI (fires at clusters = more damage)
* Unit aesthetic is more discernible between types/roles

I could probably come up with a bunch more stuff if I sat down to think about it

1339642285.0,v0zwi,Even more novice questions!,Goldreaver,11,1,8,"Hi. I’ve been playing AoE II intermittently just-for-fun for 10 years now (not planning to stop: competitiveness is what killed all my interest in starcraft)  and I had a few questions:
 

1-Did you know that without the need of having an edge over the competition you can play a game for 10 years and still don’t know basic stuff? It’s true!  
  

2-Killing a boar (or deer) with a military unit (scout) will render it unusable (I used to kill a lot of mongol deer back in the day) but what if the last hit is made by a villager?
  

 

3- If I put an infantry or cavalry unit or even a monk or a king in an empty castle
  

 

4- Teuton bombard towers filled with 10 infantry units should shoot two bombs? Because they don’t.

 
  

5- What is the civilization with best infantry? Teutonic knights are too slow and the infantry doesn’t get any bonus

 

6- Is there any unique unit the Samurai can’t beat in a mano a mano besides the War Elephant? (No ranged kiting) I tried and it could even defeat a garland wars-elite jaguar warrior.

 

7-Vikings’ unique ships are better than Galleons? Why? Why does amassing Galleons beat everything else at sea?

 

8-Turks can destroy cities and siege weapons with their cannons

 

9- Since they lack bloodlines

 

10-Bloodlines and husbandry apply to cavalry archers and Conquistadores

 

11-  Best Archer civilization? British (wait. they don't get ring

 

12-Are there any upgrades to Hand-cannoners besides Faith and the blacksmith’s armors? (I.E: does ballistics affect them?)

 

13-Best cavalary civ? Mongols with kiting

 

14-Spanish villagers are pretty resistant to harassing. Since they’re stronger than Hussars and cheaper

hehe i thought that would be pretty funny. and I dont mean ''fake drunk''. it would need be to be a commitment on his part to actually be over the legal limit to start recording.

and no I'm not volunteering myself I can't be a commentator I don't even know what's a monk.

also what about an actual 1v1 between the commentators

or what about commentators casting games that they know little about and trying to keep up. Bolt doing aoc or turkman doing aot for example. hehe I know they browse reddit from time to times so if you see this do it ya twats!

...

I know the trade profit is proportional to distance. E.g. Long trade root = High gold per trip.

However

* Markets far apart &gt; Increased gold/trip but long travel time; or
* Markets close together &gt; Less gold but faster

(Assuming straight line travel/minimal obstacles)

Does anyone know how 'trade value' is worked out? Is it:

1. Linearly proportional to distance 
    * you travel further
    * Therefore there's no value in having markets far apart
1.  Exponentially increasing
    * Higher 'risk' of longer trade route factored in
    * Better to have markets further apart

Edit: another point

* shorter trade route requires fewer trade carts (population slots) to get maximum delivery rate (gold deliveries per minute) without causing congestion

Since I've ever started playing AoC multiplayer a few months ago, I am *absolutely* terrible in imp, especially late imp.

Just yesterday I played a very enjoyable boom-centered arena 4v4 game. Dark age till mid imp went great. I had a reasonably sized army of hand cannoneers, I lose my jam and go incredibily slow with producing units and whatnot.
I usually have one army, or military buildings. I always feel like it's too much pressure in imp, checking your economy whilst using villagers to create military buildings and castles whilst making units whilst making villagers. When I started playing multiplayer aoe2, I didn't have this problem that often funnily enough, since I didn't create many villagers and spend more time focusing on military.

This is the guide that most people use I assume when flushing. My question:does the guide skip deer because they are not consistent? While berries and boar will always be there? I'm used to getting food in this order: sheep - boars -first mill on deer - second mill on berries - farms.

but this guide says sheep - boars - berries - farms
I do agree that walking distance to deer is longer(and back when the deer are done), and I can use my second mill for farms later. I guess I just answered my own question - the 100 wood and extra walking distance is not worth it in a flush,  but this question still remains: why skip deer altogether and go directly to farms?

For your convenience:

[Main thread on Voobly forums


The Voobly community seem, and by-and-large fairly negative. Their comments range from scepticism as to how well the game will sell on Steam, to the effectiveness of VAC vs Voobly mods, to the way in which AoE:FE (&amp; pop. limits) won't be available (not true - Workshop). There are many naysayers aswell, predicting that as soon as the price drops, so does the curtain for Voobly.


I actually think that Voobly won't be affected that much. I really hate it as a service

1355895313.0,153feo,QUADRICENTENNIAL MODIFY THE GAME THREAD,TheBattler,15,7,17,"**MAKE UP NEW FEATURES NEW UNITS NEW FEATURES NEW WHATEVER. STATE YOUR IDEAS**

So I am working on an overall modspansion of the game inside of my head and on an Excel (actually OpenOffice) Spreadsheet. I'm going to learn how to use GenieEd to edit the game files some day but it's a little far off.

""Age of Empires 2: The Battlers"" would basically be like this:

* **3 Ages**

My game would be cut down to 3 Ages, and the Imperial Age. This would basically be like starting in the Feudal Age in the current game. So the old Castle Age would be my Feudal.

The Dark Age would be pretty similar to the current Feudal Age. Attacks mostly focused on attacking the enemy economy and slowing them down with very little chance to destroy the enemy outright. I'd make towers stronger

The Feudal Age would have a big change. Monks would be less random but they'd be more durable. All Monks would be able to convert Castles at a range, 4 Battering Rams would be able to take them down. But you would have a long range ""Siege Weapon"" in Monks (who would have a couple of range techs early on) to capture Castles. Also Monks would be much, much less micro-intensive. They'd attempt to convert enemies without your having to make them do it and have stances and heal units in an area around them VERY SLOWLY but automatically.

The Imperial Age would be where it all comes down

* **Slightly Different Units**

Well

--------Dark Age--------

*Guard (new name for Militia/Man-At-Arms)*: The idea is that the Guards are the bodyguards of the local ruler of your small village that consists of one Town Center

*Militia (new name for Spearman):* Common folk most commonly armed with SPEARS. Get it?

*Bowman (new name for Archer):* The word ""Archer"" is going to refer to Cavalry Archers

*Slinger (new name for Skirmisher):* Most of these soldiers don't really have a specific role in battle yet

*Scout (duh)*

*Drafted Ship (Galley):* Galleys are rowed warships. The navies of the Dark Age kingdoms were frequently civillian ships pressed into action.

*Fire Galley:* I feel like it'd make more sense for the more historically advanced civs like the Chinese and Byzantines to have access to a ship that counters the Galley in the Dark Age as a general advantage.

--------Feudal Age--------

*Retainer (Long Swordsman):* An evolution of the ""Guard

*Spearman (Pikeman):* Now the commoner with a spear has a role in combat. Spearmen is both the name for a dude wielding a spear and a role in medieval combat

*Eagle Runner (Eagle Warrior) -&gt; Eagle Warrior (Heavy Eagle Warrior from FE):* The idea is that he's just a Scout at first

*Composite Bowman (old Crossbowman):* You'll see where I'm going with this, Saracens, Japanese, Koreans, Turks, Chinese, Mongols

*Skirmisher (Elite Skirmisher)*

*Crossbowman:* So now the Crossbowman is a Hand Cannoneer before the Hand Cannoneer. I know it sounds like it doesn't make sense

*Mounted Archer (Cavalry Archer):* I don't like the words ""Heavy"" and ""Elite"" so the Heavy Cavalry Archer will be just Cavalry Archer.

*Elephant Archer:* I'm planning on having an Elephant Archer unit be a common unit for the Indian civs.

*Sentry (Light Cavalry)*

*Camel Rider (Camel):*

*Knight*

*Petard*

*Battering Ram*

*Scorpio*

*Catapult (Mangonel):*

*Moving Tower:* Siege Tower in the earlier age

*Galley:* The last battle to feature Galleys was the Battle of Lepanto. In 1571. Hmmm...

*Greek Fire Galley:*

*Demolition Ship*

--------Imperial Age--------

*Retainer -&gt; Man-At-Arms -&gt; Champion*

*Pikeman:* Halberdiers had different tactics than Pikemen

*Eagle Knight:* As an Aztec warrior society and social class

*Reflex Bowman (Arbalest)*

*Cavalry Archer*

*Crossbowman -&gt; Hand Cannoneer*

*War Elephant*

*Cavalier -&gt; Paladin*

*Camel Cavalry (Heavy Camel)*

*Light Cavalry (Hussar):* Light Cavalry is a role and a Hussar is a very specific corps of soldier from Hungary. This quite weird now that FE is coming out with the Magyar Huszar.

*Capped Ram -&gt; Tortoise Ram:* I also don't like the word ""Siege"" thrown about everywhere.

*Mangonel -&gt; Onager*

*Scorpio -&gt; Cannon (Heavy Scorpion):* Now, Chinese, Franks). Plus a Cannon makes sense as a technological replacement for a forward trajectory shooting weapon.

*Siege Tower*

*Bombard Gun:* ""Gun"" used to refer to a larger cannon for destroying immobile targets

*Galleon*

*Fast Fire Galley*

*Explosion Ship (Heavy Demolition Ship)*

*Gun Galleon -&gt; Bombard Galleon (Cannon Galleon -&gt; Elite Cannon Galleon)*

* **Civs**

My dream list of civs is:

Britons

Celts - They'd lose the Siege civ thing and be more more broad with good

Franks

Teutons

Vikings - With a ton more land oomph and less water craziness. They shouldn't taper out at in the Imperial Age quite like they do now.

Goths - They'd lose the Infantry spam thing and be more similar to the current Vikings (on land, less powerful later on. They'd have very few, super strong units in the Imperial Age.

Slavs

Magyars - They'd take up more traits of the Huns

Byzantines - They'd be more of an early game civ with strong Infantry and Cavalry than the current trash civ they are right now.

Italians

Spanish

Ghana

Bantu - They'd represent the Principalities of the Swahili Coast and the Kingdom of 
Kongo and be more similar to the current Mayans with cheap Archers.

Saracens - I like the idea of a civ with very few bonuses but a nearly full tech tree more so than the Byzantines. I think the Saracens would fit that bill a bit better since they were EVERYWHERE moreso than any other civ. No Mamelukes but they'd get Paladins instead! :-D

Turks

Persians

Berbers - They'd sort of replace the Saracens

Sindhi - Northern Indians

Tamil - Southern Indians.

Khmer - They'd be a Siege civ.

Malayos (Srivijaya

Chinese - I'd make them less of a generalist civ and focus more on weird unit combinations and gunpowder.

Koreans - I'd make them the main Siege civ to replace the Celts.

Japanese

Mongols

Tibetans - They'd have some bonuses relating to armor

Aztecs - They'd become a ranged civ

Mayans - They'd receive the Goths Infantry spam niche

Zapotecs - A bit of filler
