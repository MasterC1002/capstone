Future: Rodriguez (~1.3 WAR)

*P:*

OVERALL WINS GAINED: 9.4

It is reasonable to assume that the Yankees

With these replacements being ousted by the returning stars, gain 8 wins by the end of the season, finishing 18/20 games above .500, or with a record near: 92-72, good for a .567 winning percentage, which, given how weak the rest of the AL is, will land the Yankees in the playoffs either in the second wild card spot

First of all, and his fans to have witnessed. Jesus, the replays really made that look painful as all get out. As a man who severely injured his left ankle earlier this year I know how painful it can be and I'm sure his was probably ten times worse.

I will admit: I cheered when the impossible happened and he didn't make his superhuman toss to first to get the out on that play-- but then he was just laying there and all my joy honestly drained from me. No one wants to see that happen to any player

I hope he recovers well and that this injury is not career-ending. Also? If for nothing other than selfish reasons, but I'll respect it.

Over at /r/motorcitykitties almost everyone shares this sentiment. There is no rejoicing; the assholes who are engaging in such behavior are being downvoted. I just wanted you to know that although we are rivals not all of us are so callous and cruel as to rejoice in a fellow human being's injury.

David Adams - BABIP .316 - wRC+ 153 - WAR 0.3

**Now some of my analysis**

**Cano'**s career BABIP is .320, and if that returns to his average, we could be in for a real show.

**Gardner** is having an excellent year for a guy that has struggled to stay on the field. Gardner is right at his career BABIP (.319)

**Vernon Wells** and Lyle Overbay have been AMAZING for us this year, and now he is already at 1.5. Unbelievable. His power (ISO) his higher than it has been since 2010.

**Lyle** is under his career BABIP, but that could also be affected by the short porch and the kevin long effect. Great pickup.

**Ichiro** has a career BABIP of .346 (although in 2011 it was .295, compared to his average of 30-35%.

**Hafner** has been excellent in all categories

1350260226.0,11hi6b,My thoughts so far:,SPika,34,6,20,"**Offense**

* Cano - WTF man. You are supposed to be our #1 bat. A few bad strike calls

* Arod - He looks lost, but his mental approach is not there at all. Completely lost. Is the media, fans, and the pressure getting to his head? Probably, but whatever it is, he needs to snap out of it.

* Swisher - Needs to stop clowning around. We all know his antics

* Granderson - Two strikes, but it feels like well over 75% of the time he will swing at a ball in the dirt with 2 strikes. Seriously, I feel like he will always swing at it, hoping the ball doesn't curve down in to the dirt.

* On the other hand, even Teixera have been producing. Oh, did I mention Raul Ibanez? He is pretty much our entire offense now, but we cannot keep relying on him. With Jeter out now, even Cashman stated the best way to honor Jeter is for the rest of the guys to step up. Maybe it's just me, but I didn't see that fire in our lineup. Did you? 

* This doesn't feel so much like a team effort as it does a bunch of solo guys bundled together. Martin looked decent early on

* All season long, but the majority of our offense was based on homeruns. I hate when we had huge scoring opportunities with RISP, but the batters would still try to swing for the fences. A single might be better in some cases, because it'll get the lineup moving - what I mean is you don't have to rely on guys getting big hits...you keep the ball rolling!

* It feels as if our entire offense waits for the pitchers to make a mistake. Case in point: Valverde - he was far from lights out, but in the postseason, you don't and shouldn't expect average pitching. Should we start chasing border pitches and instead of putting up a homerun swing, aim for a bloop single or a solid liner up the middle?


**Pitching**

Starting pitching has been AMAZING. All of our starters have kept us in the game. CC, even Hughes kept us in the Baltimore game. Going on short rest, putting up zeros, getting out of jams, and not allowing a blowup inning - We can't ask for more. It's unfortunate when a botched call such as tonight's led to 2 more runs (although it most likely would not have mattered). Our middle bullpen guys haven't necessarily been getting the job done, and that is frustrating.

It is PAINFUL to see the team play like this. Thanks for reading. What are your thoughts?

1372736048.0,1hh2tw,This is how it starts.,Kroxzy,17,4,9,"Three things had to happen for the Yankees to break their 5 game slide:

1. HITS. The Yankees recorded double digit hits, they scored their most runs since May 16th, showing that they are truly improving from the clusterfuck that was mid-to-late June.

2. PITCHING. Though it didn't seem like it, allowing his only run outside of the 1st on a golf home run off of a great slider.

3. LUCK. Even though the Yanks hit well and pitched pretty well, which led to a game tying homer, the ""single"" by Ichrio off of an errant throw by Burton, and the botched pickoff attempt.

Though I would have preferred a game involving more of the first two and less of the third

**In Terms of Hitting:**  Wells is (hopefully) heating up, Hafner had good swings (the monster shot he hit foul that traveled ~450 feet) and Gardner continues to be a great leadoff hitter.

**In Terms of Injuries:** The injury bug has plagued the Yankees for the entire season. However, Nix, Romine and Wells are out of the starting lineup. This seems like it will happen around July 25-August 7th:

**Rodriguez** will begin his rehab assignment on the 2nd, hopefully, only 16 days of automatic outs from Adams. 

**Granderson's** hand has healed completely

**Cervelli** is taking batting practice, just in time for the first home series after the all star break.

**Jeter** is running, I expect a rehab assignment to begin later this week, with Jeter returning in unison with Cervelli.

This is pretty much all good news and will most likely result in the Yankees returning to their winning ways

Yes, relying this much on the home run for offense somewhat worries me.  It's completely infeasible to expect Russel Martin, Jorge Posada, or Curtis Granderson to keep up their current 60-HR pace.  Hell, I don't even think Mark Teixiera can keep it up.  A-Rod, well, you never know

On the other hand

And of course, thus making it all a wash.  So, I remain cautiously optimistic - it's all well and good when we're knocking out 2 HRs/game, but I would like to see at least the possibility of a little small ball diversity.

There I was, the road ended for Alex. There was no more dwindling hope on his behalf that the efforts of MLB would be hampered by the logistics of law. Instead, the writing was apparently on the wall. Alex Rodriguez wouldn't be playing baseball until at least 2015. It seemed impossible to circumvent this discipline. A-Rod's petulance sounded increasingly surreal. ""The only way I'm not playing is if I'm struck by lightning"" while being positioned in front of a Trenton Thunder mascot that held a lightning bolt added a comedic irony to the idea that A-Rod was out of touch with a reality dictating that he would finally be subjected to justice.

But here we are today. Reports have circulated stating that the Commissioner's Office will not exercise the best interested of baseball clause in an effort to ban Alex from playing during the appeals process. Just hours ago

The idea that Alex Rodriguez will be allowed to play during the appeal of his suspension is an absolute joke. I'm not going to talk about evidence

I'm just sick of this asshole. When I was growing up, that knowledge I possess of our club's legacy just reinforces the fact that Alex doesn't deserve to wear the uniform he is determined to wear tomorrow night.

I'm tired of making excuses dependent on legal rationale. I'm tired of justifying why A-Rod deserves a life-time ban. All I'm saying is that Alex Rodriguez is a cheater,,False,self,t5_2qqfw,False,,True

Anyway

* **He's played his whole career for the Yankees.** He's going to retire this year as a Yankee and will have spent his whole career this. This is why I have him over guys like Ruth and Clemens. Yes everyone thinks of Ruth as a Yankee

* **He's won World Series Rings.** This is what puts him over Don Mattingly, you have to win it all.

* **He's had an incredibly long career and aged gracefully.** It is is incredibly rare for a baseball player to still be playing at age 43

* **He's the only player in baseball history to be undisputed as to who's the best player at his position.** This is why he wins it for me. He is the only player you talk about who's the best reliever of all time. For outfielders you could argue Mays, you could have a huge debate, but Mo is undoubtedly the greatest reliever of all time, and for me that's the biggest reason he's the greatest Yankee of all time.
