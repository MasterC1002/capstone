**THE EVENT:**          
We have the ENTIRE [Monarch](http://www.monarchbar.com/) booked exclusively from midday to 8pm. And they have even posted us as event [on their website](http://www.monarchbar.com/events/eventdetails/23-jun-12-global-reddit-meetup-day-the-monarch/). (Complete with success kid). At 8pm their club night starts and we can stay until 2am when they close. If it's not raining
    
Show up as soon or as late as you like, drinking, food, etc. Then as the evening goes on, the music will get louder and it's more like a club. 

We're expecting something like ~~150-250 people~~ ~~200+ people~~ 250+ people **Everyone is welcome

**EXCITING:**         
We have another reddit admin attending this year and he's kindly sorted us out with a bit of budget!! We will likely be putting the money behind the bar... another reason to show up early :D
    
**Please post here if you intend to attend** so I can add you to the list of awesome people and we can give the bar an idea of how many to expect: 
(if you dont get your name on this list, there's not a guestlist at the door or anything)

1342777576.0,wv7qm,Thank you and goodbye. ,Stux,60,3,53,"So about a year and a half ago I moved London after spending 4 years in America. I was filing for a divorce from my wife of 3 years. 

Things were bad. I was miserable, all my old friends had moved on or just seemed uninterested in rekindling relations with me. I spent all day in my room just reading Reddit. Somehow I stumbled onto this place, LSC. ""probably just a bunch of boring socially troubled people"" I thought but who was I to pass that judgement so I figured I'd check out one of the meet ups. Curry Night, some douche called Die_Troller was organizing it. Although I didnt really connect with anyone that night it was fun so I decided to check out the penthouse party the following week. It was a blast, these guys are not boring, they're just like me! 

The big moment was when I organized a drink in celebration of my divorce

Let me get to the point here... Im in America

I'm posting this to say thank you to all of you who have been in my life for this past year and a bit. You've all helped me along through tough times and also given me some of the best memories I will ever have. Be it from our weekend in Prague drinking shots of hard liquor in a strip club, Lawerence trying to give a rose to strangers in Soho or taking bets on how long Chris will stay awake for...

And for all you noobies

If everything goes to plan I won't be back for a couple of years. 

*raises glass* here's to LSC meet up in FL ;)

I love and miss you all

So I got bored and made a mobile friendly site for LSC events.

You can check it out here: http://lsc.eu01.aws.af.cm/

It sorts events by date so you can quickly find events that are coming up and has a little calendar up top so you can see at a glance if there are events on a date. Clicking on a date also takes you directly to the events on that day.

Clicking on the title will show you the event details

It's pretty simple (and ugly) right now but is pretty usable so I figured someone might find it useful. Give it a try and post any feedback


Also if there are any developers / designers who want to lend a hand at making this more useful and less ugly then either send me a message or check out the project on github: https://github.com/dnharjani/LSC",,t5_2s87x,1374866536.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/1iylch/lsc_i_made_you_something/

1350850816.0,11ux7m,You guys are amazing.,Rockembopper,50,5,27,"Just wanted to thank everyone who came out to the London Pub Crawl on sunday. I had a blast and you guys really brought me back up from my slump/being stuck in london for the week. Had a great time with the pre-pub crawl breakfast club and thank you guys for really being my jumping off point. 

I enjoyed how everyone when they met me shouted ""OH, kisses, and drugs. ( I don't think the drugs guy was actually apart of the crawl) Some offered to wingman for me but I was to far gone to really be effective with my talking skills. But the effort is greatly appreciated most of my friends wingman skills are just giving me thumbs up from across the room. However, my friends don't have the interesting British, Irish, Scottish, French/Russian

You guys did your mission and you did a spectacular job. So well in fact that I ended up going back and forth between 2 underground station for about 30 minutes thinking I was actually taking different lines. 

Whenever

* Everyone is welcome! Old, first timers etc. Feel free to contact numbers provided if you can't find us.

**WHERE:** [The Blue Posts](http://www.allinlondon.co.uk/clubs_bars/venue-699.php)

**WHY:** This is the pub crawl with NO crawl at all. I've booked us the private room upstairs which will accommodate up to 40 people. No fee (YAY)

Does anyone want to DJ? If yes, you can fight amongst yourselves.

The bummer is the place closes at midnight. The good thing - it's in SoHo so going out again afterwards is NOT a problem if you're on a roll. Within a stone's throw from Piccadilly and Leicester Square underground stops.

I planned this way ahead so those from outside the area can make plans to get into the area. Start booking those train tickets

**What is GrMD?**        
reddit encourages simultaneous meetups all across the globe. This year's is **June 15th**. Since it's heavily publicised on reddit and it's a ""one off"" thing

**We need a venue**         
Any ideas? Previously we've used the Monarch which has been great to us but I think it might be a bit small now plus we will have the same issue of losing the exclusive use of the booked area from 9pm
      
**Our requirements are:**          
- No hire charge (although a minimum spend should be fine)       
- Room for about 350+ people        
- Room/sound set up for a band (eek)      
- Able to accommodate us from about midday til late              
- Ideally some outdoor space

~~More than likely it will be at the Old Nick pub in Holbourn (we had the whole pub to ourself last year). But I will confirm shortly. Late Afternoon to early morning.~~

**Confirmation:** Venue will be Old Nick in Holbourn. 5pm - 11pm. http://oldnickholborn.co.uk/

20-22 Sandland Street

They remember us (in a good way) from last year. We've got exclusive use of the pub. Normal pub prices.

Stay tuned will sort out late night venue. Or suggestions more than welcome. 

And again, so if it's your first time out or your 1000th, come on down. (After browsing through PortConflict's album, I've realised that was the night I met a whole bunch of people I hang out with every week for the first time). I'll post more details closer to the time.

So get costuming!

Notting Hill/Bayswater pub crawl:

Lunch time 12-3 : The Churchill Arms

Best Thai and Guiness in Town

Great beer garden

5-7 : Kings Head

My old local. Cheap booze &amp; food.

7-10 : Westbourne House

http://www.westbournehouse.net/

Good cocktails. Slightly posh. Will bring it down to our level :)

10-1 : Notting Hill Arts Club

Dance the frigging night away.

Any other late night venues/better pub venues in the area? Harlem is shut.

Crazy Homies (downstairs with the stripper pole and cocktails) would be great

Again, so work in progress. We could decide to go to East London in the end :)

You can check out the menu [here](http://www.labbaruk.com/pdf/cocktail-list.pdf#view=fit), but aside from that very extensive list, you are encouraged to be **inventive**!  Bring the bartender something you want your cocktail to taste like, or tell him ""I want it to taste like sunshine"" or strawberry and vanilla icecream or whatever.  They get experimental and have some excellent bartenders so get crazy!

**Pub Crawl VIII - Everything to Everybody**

Full details tbc but I need numbers for the activity

Off the top of my head:  
**10am - 12pm:- Meet up and breakfast  
12pm - 2pm:- Bowling at All Star Lanes Holborn  
2pm - 7pm:- Pub crawl round cheap pubs (pubs tbc)

11pm - 3am:- Clubbing @ venue tbc (Suggestions welcome. Cheapskates?)  
3am - 5/6am:- Food at Balans (I'll confirm alcohol is served until 6am
5/6am - 10am:- Empire Casino**  

Critique, feelings?

*Potential dates for May are: ~~7th,~~ 28th.*

There'll be a few surprises on the way as well :) And if anybody makes it from 10am - 10am they'll get an official ""I survived the r/londonsocialclub 24hr pub crawl"" t-shirt :D

Now

Can I get provisional answers in the form of
Positive Expletive: Preferred Date, If Drinking, If Cocktails, If Club, If planning to be in a fit state to continue, If Casino

though just really need date

e.g.  
FUCK YEAH!: 14th, drinks, cocktails, club  
or  
RIGHT TOOTIN'!: 7th

Once I have numbers I'll sort it out and put up an official agenda and confirm attendance the Monday before hand.

http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/y38hy/031112_halloween_party/

We are kicking off from the Old Nick Pub in Holbourn. 20-22 Sandland Street

5pm - 11pm. http://oldnickholborn.co.uk/

We have the entire pub booked out just for us.  So finding us is easy.

~~Late night venue will be confirmed shortly.~~

Late night venue is Temple Walkabout, London WC2R 2PH.
£5 cover.  11:15pm - 3am.  (Sorry only place that didn't care if we show up in costume).  We're on the guestlist under my name ""Brad Jayakody"".  My mobile is 07760389766 if you don't have it/need it.

Dan is providing his sound system for kicking halloween tunes (including karaoke mikes if the night takes us that way).  

Rosa has sorted out the playlist and is decorating the pub in a spooky manner.

There was be 3 trophies for best costumes, 3 as voted by the people (picture forthcoming).

There will also be a bit of gambling occurring.  £1 buy-in.  You get 2 votes.  At what time we clear the minimum spend of £500.  And how much we spend total in the pub by the end of the night.  Last year spend was £1700 I think.  Closest to each without going over wins 50% of pot.

And a Spooky Cake competition.  Bring cake.  We eat cake.  We vote on best cake.  Winner gets a kick arse trophy. http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/11wkzx/031112_spooky_cake_contest_the_halloween_party/

It's free to get in and free to do everything with the exception of the following:

* Speed dating (£10) - If you want to do this get there early because there are only 30 spots for each gender.
* Pub Quiz (£2) - General quiz with a few parts relevant to the topic of the night (zombies).

Quick overview of what goes on at these things:

* Childrenless hands-on science experiments
* Access to most exhibits
* Silent Disco
* Speed dating (check my flair :*()

Surprisingly this is not mine, let's suit and wedding dress up and go on an unromantic crawl of London.

Currently the ideas are:

* Rotherhithe tunnel.  The most polluted tunnel in London.  ""Nothing says romance is dead like a lungful of carbon monoxide."" - Fin.

Itinerary (TBD/Confirmed):

Unlike normal crawls, Covent Garden Cocktail Club &amp; Bethnal Green Working Men's Club are 100% stops.  The rest we may or may not be there and will hang around until we get bored or find something shiny.  We'll be in the area.  Ping me a message.

12am - [G-A-Y Heaven](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=G-A-Y+Heaven&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=53.800651

Our final destination which will involve a bit of a walk from Soho to Charing Cross. The great dame of gay nightclubs in London. Big club with multiple rooms/floors and all the usual trappings that go along with that. 

We really should arrive here before midnight as it'll also be cheaper (£5 vs £10 I believe) and avoid ungodly queues.

ALSO: We can also [print out vouchers for entry here:](http://www.g-a-y.co.uk/?content=41)


**Advice**

BRING ID. Most places will have a strict 21 and over door policy.

I think we'll fine for dress code (smart/casual)

My current thoughts are that the [Royal George](http://www.theroyalgeorgewc2.co.uk/findus/) pub from the pub crawl could do well

I will be bringing a magic bag of games:
[Settlers of Catan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Settlers_of_Catan): a game with the dubious honour of being the only time it is socially acceptable to shout ""I've got wood for your sheep!""
4 player ""construction"" and trading game, no expansions.  Bring 'em if you got 'em.

[Risk!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)) a classic table top strategy and luck game (some argue more one than the other - the debate rages).  Up to 6 players undertake the conquest of Australia **AND THEN THE WORLD!**  Best known for causing friendships to fray: ""If you attack me you will lose more than your armies.""

[The Order of the Stick Adventure Game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_stick#Board_game) is a game for up to six players.  Construct the dungeon as you explore

[Scrabble](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble) Word game for 4 players - make words

Magic Bag potentials:
Poker Kit - deck or cards and chips.  
Jenga.  Too much tension in a pub
Thud! The game based on the game from the Discworld books.  Two players.  

Will update this when I get home and look at my game shelf.  


Please post any comments, complaints, curses and blessings.

If it comes to that we can use the EU Tribes mumble as I have admin rights in my old team channel and I can just re-purpose it for the event. If we do it this way we can do it any day we want which is a plus

Last but not least - if we do manage to find a place to do this but we have a lot of people interested we can always combine the two options. I'm not sure how we'd decide who stays at home and who comes to the event but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Maybe a first come first served basis so nobody seems like the bad guy :P

We play in [Regents Park in Central London](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?msid=207627779850726004772.0004d3d52e8f5207eecb0&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=51.525567, YAY for £7 for BEER+BURGER!

**What If I cant play on Sundays?**


If you cant make it Sunday's or would like to play EXTRA



**Who can come along?**

EVERYONE IS WELCOME, age, absolutely anyone can play with us, and if they don't feel like playing they are welcome to cheer, take pictures or referee.

**How much does it cost?**

Playing footy is ABSOLUTELY FREE! Some of us do sometimes go to the pub across the road to have a drink after the game

Although FREE, no pressure if you cant or if its your first time coming.

**What kind of footy do we play?**

It varies! We have played from 11-a-side to 3-a-side

**How do I book?**

No booking needed

**Can I bring a friend?**

YES! BRING TWO! the more the better!

**I'd love to join in. Do I have to endure the embarrassing picking teams school playground style scenario?**

No! Our team selection seems to be quite fair, we then divide the groups by colour of t-shirt (we are racist that way) usually dark colours vs clear, after that, once we start playing if we see it's not even (and even if it's not) we swap a few players to make it more interesting. There is no bench, but you're welcome to take a quick breather or have a drink mid match.

**Can goalkeepers apply?**

We love Goalkeepers!

**Do you have multiple teams/games then?**

It depends on how many show up really. We had 17 turn up a few weeks ago so we stuck to 8v9 the whole time. The week before that we had 24 so we played 12v12 and after 90 minutes we split into 4 teams of 6 and did a mini league.

**What type of turnout have you had before?**

The turnout is now averaging around twenty to twenty five

**Do I need to bring anything?**

No, we normally have enough but too many is better than too few!


**I would like to play weekdays too

Keep an eye on the subreddit! We currently play 6-a-side games on Wednesday (Stratford) and Thursdays (Camden Road) they normally go on a ""First come first serve"" system and bookup quite quickly!

Colour format: CMYK
File format: PSD, PDF, EPS, AI

*please note: we don't accept 72dpi files as they are not adequate to create a quality job*

**A few tips to get awesome results...**

1. Create artwork at 300dpi - the larger and clearer the file
2. Use text wisely – small writing won’t show as well as bold

 * Myself and zombiecommand are going to be the organisers/judges. Lowercase_Drawer also expressed a preference for this

 * We've put together a spreadsheet listing the 80-odd items you can 'collect' a photo of. This will be distributed on the day (this is why the judges can't play). You'll get a higher amount of points for an item if you get it and no other teams do (or only a few do). There's also a multiplier for difficulty for some items, if you include a certain item in your photo when shooting something else, your score is 0. Sounds harsh? You love it. The idea is it adds a bit of drama and intrigue to proceedings. You won't know what the nullifiers are.

 * We'll all meet at a central location, photograph them, and return.

 * Judges will download your photos onto a laptop (bring USB cables / card readers!) and work out points and bonuses. After a few hours we'll hook the laptop up to a projector screen (if anyone knows any nice pubs that can do this

 * There might be bonus points

How does this sound to everyone? Are we all in?! Ideally this will happen on a weekend or bank holiday so everyone's available.

If you'd like to play

 * **Any dates you're not free (say in the next 2 months?)**
 * **If you'd like to be a team captain (teams will be 5-6 people so this depends on numbers)**

Note that we have a pretty hefty list now of suggestions for items for the hunt itself so we don't need any more of those.

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks

Thank you to everyone for filling in the survey

**When is it happening?** Saturday

**How many people can attend?** The venue said we can fit a maximum of ""about 50""

**How much is it?** The paintball place are kindly extending the Groupon deal to EVERYONE who is joining us, equipment hire, gun and 100 paintballs for £3!  Budget spending more money on more paintballs, lunch etc - I don't know how much these will be yet.

**What is this about a coach?** As we have so many people, and more fun :)  Cost should be about £10 each, possibly slightly less, will confirm closer to the day (Train is £12 and Taxi £4 each, or so)

**I already have a Groupon ticket, will pay the venue directly (again £3 for the same deal).

**What do I do now?**  I have to ask you to properly confirm again in this thread

This is going to be epic!

**I have changed the original 3 bedroom apartment. We are now all in the same building and have a terrace to play on! We will be residing in the same building.**



We have put down a deposit on a [three bedroom apartment room 33 WITH A TERRACE](http://www.prague-city-apartments.cz/product/about_en_RESIDENCE_KARLOVA.html) WHICH IS NOW BOOKED. [Floor plan](http://www.prague-city-apartments.cz/large_view_en.html?detailID=1003237&amp;photoID=22813&amp;res=600) 

It sleeps 8 people but we are going to have to book a second place. I have asked for 2 extra beds so we can fit all 8 there. It's a lot more spacious than the other place.
The rate will be exactly £149 each for the 4 nights (Split between 8). Pretty reasonable in my opinion.

I am not opposed to the idea in future, but this one it will operate like a regular crawl, just with more pubs and less time at each. In terms of drinks it is highly recommended you stick to half-pints or single shots. 

If you want to have a different type of drink at each pub please feel free to do so

Times and pub locations listed in the previous post, get to each pub, order and consume beverages. So, if meeting part way through the crawl please text me at:  to find out where we are. Also, if one other person can post his/her number as backup, it would be much appreciated.

**Edit1:** InsertRandomName has generously offered to allow me to post her number in case my phone's not working. It is.

**Edit2:** I'm heading out in a few minutes. Looks as though we should have around a dozen people for the start and pick up at least another dozen as the day goes on. I am amazed that there this many people willing to give the circle line a go. I think this is going to be a lot of fun. See all of you out there.

Just finished chatting to a few of the pubs.  I will get confirmation shortly

Pubs may change, horror, the weather is actually any good in September.

https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Crystal+Palace+Triangle&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en

**12-3 pm : The Grape and Grain.**  http://thegrapeandgrainse19.co.uk/

Anerley Hill

A fantastic boozer

**3-5pm : The Alma.** http://www.thealmapub.com/ 

95 Church Road, SE19 2TA

An okay little boozer in the corner of the triangle.  I preferred it before it got gastropubified.

**5-8pm : The Postal Order**  : http://www.jdwetherspoon.co.uk/home/pubs/the-postal-order-crystal-palace

2-33 Westow Street, SE19 3RW

Yes it's a weatherspoons.  Yes it's a bit shite.  Yes it has cheap food &amp; booze.  This is a pit spot to replenish.  Granted we also make any place awesome.  No beer garden though.

**8pm-2am: Westow House** http://www.westowhouse.com/

79 Westow Hill  Gipsy Hill

They have a pub cat &amp; table tennis table.  Sat nights are normally some sort of either band or DJ.  And after 11ish there is dancing.  Also large beer garden.  Free entry.  We're there until 2am.

**2-&gt;?** You are on your own.  Usual suspects my spare room &amp; couch is available for crashing

Night buses run to Brixton &amp; Elephant and Castle.  I'm normally coming the other way

Mobile is Brad 0 double 7 603 897 double 6.  But I will post/update this closer to event day with 100% confirmed details.

I'll be dropping Charlie off home during the second pub

Charlie will be attending at least the first pub.

Here's a [map](http://goo.gl/maps/J8Ei) showing where the suggested venues are. The route between the places will be decided on the day.     

Got a digital camera? (Yes.) Not sure how to get the best out of it? (Ummm… how do I switch this thing on?) Not familiar with all the features? (What do you mean I can do more with it then just point and shoot?) Come join a photowalk with tutoring from our resident professionals! All levels of skills and cameras welcomed. Heck

We're meeting at [The Water Poet](http://www.thewaterpoet.com/), since this is a place LSCers know well. I get out of work at 5pm, so I shall hang around there from 5.30ish. I presume we will venture onwards at around 6.30-7pm.  

Keeping in mind that we want to explore the settings of our cameras in different lights

I shall update this with more details of route and timings at some point. Also please let me know if I’ve forgotten some important detail.  

And just to keep things entertaining and suitably juvenile

Rules:  

* A bomb is qualified only if you’re not the intended subject of the photo being taken (i.e. you jump into the frame at last minute or to the background of others posing for a photo)  
* You must look in to the camera **edit** I'd say it's preferable to look into the camera
* **MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL:** you must make a silly face  

I shall judge this competition, proper photos too, so don't just go for quantity. The beauty of a good photobomb is the execution and the element of surprise. And don't forget the silly face! The winner will get a framed shot of his/her bomb and a drink. That is all.

If you don't have a bicycle, but it would probably be best to refresh your steed at the docking stations every now and then to avoid a large charge.

There are often a few of us who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub.*

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time. On average we're currently getting 18-25 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 35ish.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks

Since after the above people still asked...

**If you've never watched a US Election Result before**
Thanks to the US Electoral College system- US Elections are pretty fun to watch! There's constant news streaming in and celebrations when state results are announced. Nevermind the fact that it's one of the least fairest or democratic voting systems available (those who've studied voting theory will know)- we get a night of entertainment! 

**Location:** Is at the Lexington

This was the best place that had no cover-charge with a pretty good location for night buses. There's also loads of bars and restaurants nearby if anyone wants to pop out for a bit.  

**Time:** Looking to start around **6-7** to at least get the places

**Election Night Drinking Game!**: A drinking game will be invented for the night's enjoyment and potentially bingo if I find the time.

**EXTREMELY IMPORTANT UPDATE**

We have 50 or so people confirmed attending. The bar are operating a first come first serve basis and they've experienced a huge surge in demand so aren't doing reservations (They said they expect 200-300 people to show up). We need people to help set up camp and get stuff on as many seats as possible for redditors! Please help by coming as early as possible and dropping your stuff off. Then go enjoy Angel- eat out

So I thought **Sunday 1st of July** would be a great day to have on, although you never know how that will turn out this far ahead, but lets give it a whirl anyway. If they are wrong and its raining we can go teepee the Met Office instead.

[**Regents Park**](http://goo.gl/y0yO7) is probably our best bet, which should make you all misty-eyed for your bygone youth. 

If anyone has any football jerseys, which might be the handiest colours to get.

Everyone is welcome! There is no requisite skill level, with tag-in tag-out subs.  Even if you dont want to play, it should be good fun to come and watch us fall about the place, while you engage a can of beer on the sideline :) I'll be there for 2pm, and we can go for the traditional Sunday Kickoff time of **3pm**

After we're all worn out, I dont think they show the footy.

Let me know if you are coming

Give me a call or a text on the day or before if you need know anymore: 075 double zero 58 13 zero 2

Any LSC redditors out there with a bike? I was thinking of arranging a motorcycle ride? I'm not sure if this is in the ethos of social club

Any riders fancy a day trip?

EDIT: If most people are on 'L' plates I will make sure its a legal/achievable route for 125cc bikes and scooters.

EDIT 2: This was just a quick message to see if there was any interest. It seems like there is! I'll get a route and date arranged and make a post nearer the time (Ride will probably be late September)

Right now I'm thinking, have some lunch, ride some more. Then home with maybe a few beers in central once the bikes have been put to sleep. Possibly do London to Brighton and back on some nice scenic backroads. Nothing is set in stone for a route, I'm open to suggestions and we can take a vote if need be.

2 highest scoring teams at the end of all the games play off in the final.  

For those not involved in the current game of bowling there is karaoke and a Wii set up (could even play Wii bowling!) and while I doubt it'll be quiet with karaoke if anyone wants to set up a few ipod playlists we can get that on too.

Cost is £420 for 12:00 - 15:30 and would mean a slight delay on the crawl part

To confirm the date is Saturday the 28th of May.

The venue is **Autumn Street Studio Unit 3, it's just down by the canal *before* you cross the bridge to the Olympic park.

Disclaimer : Most of this thread is shamelessly stolen from [/u/fross](http://www.reddit.com/user/fross)

**What?**

A daytrip to Brighton.

**When?**

Monday

**Why?**

r/LSC invaded [Brighton](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/r46f7/090412_easter_monday_rlsc_invades_brighton/) last year, Sunshine (this didn't happen last time), fun, drink and stuff. We did get amazing pictures of people being soaked in waves though.

**Who?**

Everyone is invited. Sign up below


**How?**

Transport: Train tickets will be REALLY CHEAP if you book soon. If you get a Super Off Peak Day Return, or £5 each roundtrip from London Bridge! I've checked, it is valid that day, but it has to be bought 2 weeks in advance, which gives you until the 17th to book them.

Tickets can be bought [here](http://www.firstcapitalconnect.co.uk/)

~~I've got 1 4-person ticket so far

**Itinerary**

I am going to suggest everyone going by train get the 10:57 train from London Bridge which gets in at 11:55. (I have confirmed the train times listed here are compatible with the cheap tickets) The groups of 4 do need to travel together

•Arrive in Brighton about 12:00

•Go to the seafront

•Find something to eat - either a restaurant (suggestions welcome)

•After lunch, go to the pier, go shopping in the Lanes, go to a pub (if the weather is awful). Aim to meet back at a particular place (TBA) at 5pm. brit_pop recommends wearing JELLIED EEEEELS on the beach and eating vintage clothes (mmm, that texture).

•At 5, have some food, and so on. 

•About 9pm, but it is a work day the next day!

To add to the challenge I'm going to attempt to walk between each station myself. You're welcome to do it this way with me

The other major difference from the first time around is that I'm going to be raising money for Bowel Cancer UK (my charity of choice for my own personal tube walking). I'm going to ask that people make a £10 donation via My [JustGiving page](http://www.justgiving.com/randomlylondon) before they come along. I'm not going to make it a requirement

Only 4 LSCers have ever completed the whole thing

**FAQ**

Why is this held on a Thursday and not a Saturday?

The circle goes through large sections of the City where pubs are closed on the weekend. Plus

Where will it start/end?

Since I'm organising it's going to start and end in South Ken. Start time will be 11am sharp as that's when the first local pub opens.

Some of you might remember me as the odd fella from Secret Cinema handing out comps here every now and then

I bumped into [Project X](http://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/xbg4n/partycrashing_an_empty_festival_site_my_company/) here not long ago and checked it out with Jess (joosicat3).

Me and a few others sprung into action and decided to put on a **free** mini festival there this coming Saturday

1332198111.0,r46f7,[09/04/12] (Easter Monday) r/LSC invades Brighton!,fross,15,3,97,"This thread will be to provide information to help coordinate a trip and will be edited with more info as we get closer to them time.

**What?**

A daytrip to Brighton.

**When?**

Monday, coming back at night.  Or staying over if you want to.

**Why?**

I need to go pick up some speakers, Sunshine (hopefully), fun, drink and stuff.  I want to fling a frisbee close enough to the water to have someone trip and get soaked (now watch me do just that)

**Who?**

Everyone is invited.  Both LSC people and some natives from [/r/Brighton](/r/Brighton) who will be joining us.  Sign up below

Londoners

So far

fross, Lowercase\_drawer, Artificial\_Limey, miaoued, phenorbital, PoshNoob, jaymeekae (blessing the rains), UbikRubik, artiomchi, ruthmf

And joining us from sunny Brighton:

haywire

**How?**

Transport: There is only one car going down now, and buy it for 4 people with the Groupsave option, it's just £20, or £5 each roundtrip from London Bridge!  I've checked, it is valid that day, but I think you have to buy SO-PDRs 2 weeks in advance, which gives you until the 25th to book them.

Train groups (for the cheap tickets - think everyone will be on the same train anyway)

 - phenorbital - Lowercase\_drawer
 - Goldensilverware - InsertRandomName
 - Artificial\_Limey - PlussOne
 - ghettro - saiph


Needs ticket: ubikrubik, arseoutofthemselves (maybe)


***Itinerary***

I am going to suggest everyone going by train get the **10:57 train from London Bridge** which gets in at 11:55.  (I have confirmed the train times listed here are compatible with the cheap tickets) The groups of 4 do need to travel together

 - Arrive in Brighton about 12:00
 - Go to the seafront
 - Find something to eat - either a restaurant (suggestions welcome)
 - After lunch, go to the pier, go shopping in the Lanes, go to a pub (if the weather is awful).  Aim to meet back at a particular place (TBA) at 5pm.  Artificial_Limey has also recommended a **""life-changing"" cup-cake store** at http://www.angelfoodbakery.co.uk/gallery.php
 - At 5, have some food, and so on.  TBA.  At this point I will also trundle off with Kaer to pick up my speakers then join you later!
 - About 9pm, but it is a work day the next day! :(

&amp;amp;gt; £10 per bottle on all house wine
&amp;amp;gt; 4 bottles for £12 on selected lager
&amp;amp;gt; Bartender's special - only £5 on our advertised cocktail 24/7

Then move onto some of Wimbledon's other fine establishments.

This is meant to be a post scavenger club event so as not to clash or cause any issues.

Trains head from Wimbledon to Waterloo up until 00:48 and take ~20 minutes so it is even suitable for you Londoners that don't live in the south.

It's been one week since I left beautiful London, Alabama, so even tube strikes are better than no tube). I've been braving the 90+ degree weather every day (roughly 34 degrees C) and dreaming of summer showers and wind, real wind that doesn't feel like the air that shoots out of your oven when you open it. I've been waking up at 5:30 AM and passing the fuck out at 10:30 PM, and I am not amused, and I know this is all your faults.

Still, and the constant hustlebustle of London, and zoo lates and Sam Smith's pub crawls and Stux telling me I've been in London too long as I chew on a huge plate of burnt ends. 

I mentioned before to various people while I was drunk and probably at a Sam Smith's that London and London Social Club seemed to be very much a ""right here, and so people will rotate in and out. People go back to Canada. Massachusetts college boys disappear in the night. princessbunny gets deported to South Africa unless she gets a job. heresyourhardware and nonexcludable get sent back to Ireland, those paddy bastards. 

I'm glad I was there when LSC was so vibrant, and that the core group of people are all moved on. I hope that doesn't happen and you guys stay ""real friends"", instead of just ""people from the internet"". 

You're all beautiful, and I wish I had gotten to know you guys better while I was here. I'm glad I was a part of LSC right here, right now. You're all welcome in the south anytime.

Add to this a very special back2back session featuring three of Bristol’s finest; Krust, Die and Dynamite MC!

This event is bring your own booze. I'm going to have some of the usual beer, but if you want anything extra special, please bring it along.    
Also remember
Liverpool Street is right on the doorstep of Brick Lane, Liverpool Street Station over the road should you need to escape for any reason. There's even a McDonalds should you have a desperate craving for a double cheeseburger or McFlurry.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub
There are often a few who will eat there

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time. On average we're currently getting 18-25 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 35ish.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks

Since after the above people still asked...

This is at the AAA in Kensington, there's actually room to dance. (But I've only been once, so grain of salt.)

Pre-drinks at the Goat from 7pm. It's just a few doors down, which might happen. I think the actual band starts around 8.

The inspiration for this crawl is that the [Thames Clippers](http://www.thamesclippers.com/) serve alcohol

****

**NOON**
We will begin at noon at the [Trafalgar Tavern](http://www.trafalgartavern.co.uk/)


To get here, and walk east 8 minutes, past the ferries. If you feel like it, pick up your ticket for the **1643** Thames Clipper to London.

****

**2pm**
[The Gipsy Moth](http://www.thegipsymothgreenwich.co.uk/) is a 10 second walk from the Cutty Sark, and will prepare us for the journey.


As we're less than a 5 min walk from the ferry tickets, come back and drink more.

****

**425pm**
We embark on a voyage of bravery and sightseeing! We head to the Thames Clippers.

**443pm**
WE'RE ON A BOAT!!! A 35 minute ride with drinks

****

**520pm**

TATTERSHALL CASTLE Embankment.

****

**730pm**
We load into the Northern line at Embankment and head to Camden to queue at [KOKO](http://www.koko.uk.com/). The queue at 8-9 is almost nothing

****

**930pm**
[Buttoned Down Disco](http://www.buttoneddowndisco.com/) at KOKO. It is free before 10 but there is a queue so we have to get there early. I will print a zillion invites so we can all go free.

****

This is the approximate itinerary

THIS IS ENGLAND so we are going rain or shine. Probably rain. The boats are covered though

I am organising this to celebrate my birthday, pirates, parrots, etc. NOT NECESSARY so don't let it scare you but I like a good bit of dressing up fun.

Sign up here if you like

For those concerned! A thames clipper ticket is 6 quid, there's another 20mins later, so no worries. But drinking alone on a boat's just not the same.

* Meet new people
* Play their games
* Play our games

Contact on o77three2 o5three465

*ORIGINAL POST*  
Board game meetups are always pretty popular but I'm sure there's things we think we could do better :D

Would anybody be interested in designing a board game at a meetup instead?

£50 gets us  

* 2
* 20 blank dice  
* 1
* 20 miscellaneous dice (4x D4, D12, D20)  
* 20 D6  
* Some Sharpies  
* Some blank card

Suggested Format:  
£10 in each
We meet up on the 11th (or whenever) and dish out the equipment.  
Everybody goes home and makes a prototype and then we meet on the 18th to play-test. Split into groups of 4 or 5 (unless you make a 2 player game).  

Once we've tested everyone's game we pick one to develop further and see how far we can take it :)

Might be a silly idea

FAQ

I've never played a board game in my life - will it be alright?

The majority of people who came along last week had never touched a game (spare the dreaded Monopoly). Come down, which is excellent. Go for it!

I'm a beast at boardgames! Which ones I'll be dominating this time?

Last week we had Cards Against Humanity, the Resistance and Settlers of Catan. This week I'm adding Munchkin, Ticket to Ride, Citadels, San Juan, the Games of Thrones Board Game. If you've got your own that you wish to crush us with (literally or figuratively), bring it along!

Do I need to bring in anything?

A few pounds/guineas/knuts/credits/groats for the barkeep to provide you with quenching ales

Can I bring along some friends of mine?

The more the merrier. Literally. Bring as many as possible. Willing or not.

1350916133.0,11wa25,[26/10/12] Rockaoke - Star of Kings - Kings Cross,jaymeekae,13,3,44,"Thursdays are now a day of mourning since our regular rockaoke at the Richard Steele has been pulled due to noise complaints... but we should be ok by friday so lets head down to Kings Cross and show N1 how it's done.

Here is a rockaoke FAQ!    

**What is rockaoke? Is it karaoke but only rock songs?**      
No! Rockaoke is like karaoke but with a LIVE BAND!     
     
**Wow
I know!     
       
**But how will I know what words to sing?**        
They have the words printed out!      

**But how will I know when to come in and stuff?**         
Well it does help if you know the song reasonably well but the band is there to help you out
     
**What if I am not a very good singer?**      
Great! Even better! Just rock out more and no one will notice!     
          
**Do any of the band members have cats?**     
Yes!       

**I really would rather do this at The Richard Steele**     
Well i know
         
**Is it ok to come if I am new/have never come to a lsc event before/have just arrived in town/am shy/don't like to sing/am a girl/only have one arm/am not really sure about all this?**        
Yes! Everyone is welcome except those underage or people who do not like fun.   
         
**I do not like fun.**        
Have you tried living in Belsize Park and writing letters to the council? It might be right up your street!   

**SHUT UP RAMBLING WHAT TIME DOES THIS HAPPEN?**
The band starts at 8 or something I guess I dont know, or if they dont do that any more, then you can congratulate them on their improved rockaoke event hosting skills.       
       
**WHERE?**       
~~The Richard Steele~~ NOPE! This is not at the richard steele *tear*... it's at [Star of Kings](http://www.starofkings.co.uk/)

This may be a bit of blather

Basically a baking and perhaps cook off challenge.  Cakes

Baking is much easier as it does not require us to have access to a kitchen.

So there are a few options:

* We take over a pub/room
* We attempt to do an outdoor event
* We hire a kitchen - can both cook on day (bonus points) or bring in pre-baked goods.
* Someone offers up their house for 40+ ppl.

The list of quotes I've got for venues are as follows:

* http://www.cookeryschool.co.uk/
* Underground cookery school, £1000 for 4 hours
* A Commercial Kitchen in battersea
* West London University Kitchen
* Dephna commercial Kitchens
* Scotch Malt Whisky Society Tasting Rooms

I've also got a lead on a cafe that shuts on the weekend that we may be able to use for cheap.  But I will only get confirmation on that in a fortnight.  But at the moment I'm planning to go with SMWS.  It's the private room with about half a dozen tables and can easily hold 40 people.  No beers on tap

No kitchen

Assume we'll start at 4pm.  Judging starts at 6pm.  Once judges have tasted the work and marked

The following is myself throwing out ideas:

In order to cover costs and award some prizes.  If you wish to be a judge

If you are attending and not bring home cooked baked goods

If you are attending to compete and bringing baked goods

Which means there will be prize money awarded to first

You don't have to cook for the masses

Anyway, so shall be fine tuned, but keep the date free if you wish to bake/eat.

There will of course be ample opportunity to sample previous brews (the best part of brewing is the waiting for the next stage)...

**edit to add info**

Am based in South London (SE25

Next brew day will probably be on Sunday the 12th of Feb.

Start to finish takes about 4 hours.

Next brews are likely to be a Russian Imperial Stout and/or an IPA

If the weather really

The only gate open is the Monkey Gate at the North of Regent Park.   Here's some much better instructions on how to get there.  

http://bakerstreetastro.org.uk/info/location/

From the e-mail I just got from them.

&gt; And as if that wasn’t enough, we’ll be giving away yet another telescope with accessories to one lucky prize-draw-winner on 18th January, courtesy of the Widescreen Centre and the British Astronomical Association. 

&gt; On the 18th there will be no less than three planets for you to observe, don’t worry: we have plenty of friendly people who’ll be happy to give you a tour of the constellations, point out bright stars and planets and show you the deep sky wonders such as the Orion Nebula and the Andromeda Galaxy. I’ll be getting nice big images of Jupiter on a camera liveview screen and looking forward to seeing the beautiful yellow and blue double star Almach.

&gt; The skies will already be dark at 6pm as we start setting up the telescope deck at The Hub - so please do wrap up warm and consider bringing plenty of clothing layers to keep the winter chill at bay. Although there are pathway lights from Monkey Gate to The Hub (see map)

For those that don't know, galaxy formation and all the geeky astrophysics stuff :)

Anyway, ping me when you get there and I'll come get you at the gate.

**When**: Sunday the 4th of December. Lunch at noon

**Where**: Roast lunch at [The Prince Regent](http://www.theprinceregentw1.co.uk/) at 12pm - area reserved under Rosa. Address is 71 Marylebone High Street, Great Portland St and Regent's Park tube.

**How much**: Winter Wonderland is free entry

**DRESS CODE SUGGESTION: CHRISTMAS JUMPERS ALL THE WAY!** Or anything Christmassy/hipster if you feel like it. Think Ironic/Ugly jumpers party. 
somabc really really *reaaaally* encourages you to wear red trousers too.

1315321176.0,k6ggw,17/09/2011 - Camping reminder and sign up time!,Le_Chuck,11,1,65,"Deep in the dark recesses of almost a month ago I posted about an LSC one night extravaganza of camping (read: getting drunk in a field with a fire and lots of other LSC people). The date is rapidly approaching so it's time to get this organised.

For those who didn't see the original post/can't remember:

We'll be staying at [Debden House](http://www.debdenhouse.com/Campsite/Campsite.html) which is conveniently [located](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=ig10+2nz&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=51.65512,-4.064941&amp;sspn=21.27781,39.506836&amp;z=15) right on the edge of Epping Forest (with access to the forest from the site) and close to Debden tube (central line, which thankfully has no planned engineering works for that weekend). We will be staying on their firefield, so we'll be able to have a campfire and possibly barbecue*.

Detailed [prices](http://www.debdenhouse.com/Campsite/CampingPrices.html) are available on the website, I'm happy to help with getting that arranged. We can be on site from midday onwards (and have to vacate by the following midday) so we can have a good afternoon of walking in the forest/playing games/whatever you want to do.

You will need to bring your own drink and food (I will update if/when I manage to arrange a barbecue). I'm currently trying to sort out a monstrous load of marshmallows for everyone as well

If anyone wants to drive to the site

We already have a gazebo (possibly 2) but if you want to bring anything else in that vein

*Does anyone have a barbecue that they're happy to bring? (We can work out a way to get it there and back safely) I have just remembered the concept of disposable barbecues

**Does anyone have a spare tent they don't mind being used by a fellow redditor?** Also

We will be taking the 10:50 from paddington
Things we are thinking about doing in Oxford:

* Visiting The Natural History and Pitt Rivers Museum (contains actual shrunken heads)
* climbing University Church tower to get a good view of the town.
* renting a bike and cruise around town.
* depending on weather may try our hand at punting or small boat trip.
* attempt to meet fellow redditors from r/oxford.
* drink.
* eat.
* be merry.

* alexn - Jericho street fair(canel street) selling ice-cream at G&amp;D's
* mishpotato
* Gnz
* chrismint - Bar in Jericho
* nudiraf - cellar bar later on.


**EDIT**

   **PLANS**

* People traveling by train meet at Paddington at 10:40
* Meet-up rest outside Oxford Train station at 12.
* Walk down high street for about 10 min. 
* Drop by the Missing Bean
* We can either have lunch first(Chiang Mai Kitchen or Burrito place around the corner) and then climb the tower or climb tower first.
* Continue down high street for another 5 min to Magdalen boat house (pick up water if you have not already done so)
* Check out Magdalen's Fellow Garden
* Begin punting :-). I’m guessing we will start around 1:30-2pm
* Finish punting :-(. Due to time we may only be punting for hour.  If we are having fun we may look at dropping some things from the itinerary and continue punting.
* Walk towards the Pitt Rivers Museum. 15 min walk.
* Wander around Museum for an hour. Most likely won’t see everything in this time
* Head towards Jericho street fair. 15 min walk.  
* Buy ice cream from G&amp;D's. Meet alexn
* Enjoy fair
* Locate pub in Jericho.  Enjoy drinks. Guessing we get here around 5-6pm.

Itinerary ends at this point

Will plan on dropping by the cellar and catch up with some other redditors. Other than that we will just wing it until we drop. 

Trains run until midnight

I have dropped the bike rental as it made a few things awkward

I'm concerned that after the epicness of Pub Crawl VIII, but perhaps less physically endangering.

I propose the following:

 * We, based around photos (as opposed to buying/collecting things). Examples could be: a photo of your team in front of the London Stone, a picture of your team on a boat on the Thames, proof of your team eating at a traditional fish &amp; chip shop, a photo of someone from your team with a real Pearly King.

 * Everyone else up/down votes these suggestions and we pick off the best 20 or so. We then pick a date (ideally a weekend/bank holiday) and divide into teams (maybe 5 or so people each but depends on numbers).

 * The first team back to the Princess Louise (of course) with all of their items wins. 

**But wait

 * **The team who manage to provide photo evidence of a reddit meme in action will win an arbitrary number of bonus points** as determined by the votes of the other teams. This could be you posing by a statue of a soldier and shouting ""AND MY AXE!"" or maybe you've photobombed some tourists with some F7U12 faces. Either way

 * After the winners and losers get their prizes

Who's in?! And who has ideas for the kind of things we could add to the scavenger list?

EDIT: jaymeekae raised some good questions/points:

- We should have a wide range of activities (say 50 items) with different points depending on the level of difficulty

- Teams should stay together and not split up to go and get items. This is a group task!",,t5_2s87x,True,,THEIR,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/hojlx/ladies_gentlemen_of_lsc_i_present_the/

The reason that I am deciding to organise this trip is not just because I think redditors would get a kick out of it but also because my Grandad was not only one of the lead engineers in building of the computer but he also rebuilt the current version that is in the museum from scratch.  I have not been to the museum since the exhibit was fully finished and as my Grandad died last year I think it would be a great opportunity to go and see it.

As far as I can tell there is nothing more extreme than the circle line pub crawl when it comes to drinking. And

We would need to start early (around 10am) and it would work best on a weekday (pubs in the City are usually closed on the weekend). I know this may exclude many people who have 9-5 jobs

Of course like all meetups it would be open to everyone. People would be more than welcome to come along and drink at every pub (or even at all). Just keep in mind that the pace would have to be much faster than normal (less than 20 mins a pub).

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub
There are often a few who will eat there

*I usually get to the pub for 18:00 - 18:15, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time. On average we're currently getting 18-25 people turn up, this has ranged from 2 (once!) to 35ish.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm  ******* **is it OK if I come along?**

Brad had the idea of getting people to suggest dares or challenges for me (and the crew) to complete. That sounds good to me.

~~Do any of the band members have cats?~~

It's free to get in and free to do everything with the exception of the following:

* **Speed dating** (£10) - If you want to do this get their early because there's 30 spots for each gender. There's usually a male shortage too
* **Pub Quiz** (£2) - General quiz with a few parts relevant to the topic of the night.

http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/events/events_for_adults/Lates.aspx

Quick overview of what goes on at these things:

* Speed dating (you get a free drink!)
* Playing around with the science experiments
* Dressing up as a cockroach and touring the museum
* Doing a pub quiz we never win
* Silent Disco
* [More events](http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/events/events_for_adults/Lates.aspx) - ie

Poker, actual details (buy in, rebuys, etc to be worked out, but probably around £25 depending on what other people think).

Venue seems to be my house (SE25 / Norwood Junction) but am open to other offers ;)

We'll make sure to have a few hands as a dry run for people who are a bit rusty or who haven't played before.

**More details:**  
^This ^is ^just ^what ^I ^was ^thinking

* No Limits Texas Hold'em (if there's enough people and/or interest then maybe some Pot Limit Omaha Hi-Lo Poker or other poker variant)
* £25 is going to be the max buy in
* Maybe tournament style (1st place gets 75%

Transport:

* Train to Norwood Junction (take the Woodside / Clifford Road exit) and then a 7 minute walk
* Train to East Croydon

I've messaged everyone with my address and number

I'll provide a case or two of beer and there's coffee and tea on demand

I have 4 packs of decent cards

One of England's oldest cemeteries. Apparently it's like the set of a horror film in there.

I have heard all about this cemetery it sounds/looks incredible. We will be visiting the West cemetery. £7 to get in and it's on a first come first serve basis so we need to get there a little early. [tour info here](http://www.highgate-cemetery.org/index.php/tours)

We will meet at Archway station (On northern line) at 10am... Hope to see you there. **Each tour takes a maximum of 15 people.**

[Website](http://www.highgate-cemetery.org/index.php/home)

 **What is the difference between the East and the West Cemetery?**

""The West Cemetery is very slightly older than the East (about 20 years) and has larger architectural structures. The East has a larger number of notable people buried in it

If you're coming from the station it'd be a bit faster to walk down Shepherds Bush Road and then enter brook green on the right rather than the normal route to Latymers down Hammersmith road and entering brook green on the left.

There is also a pub quiz on in the pub Monday nights

We'll be out back in the beer garden



I'll post my number on the day for those who would like to contact me. It is difficult to get signal in the garden though.

*What do you get if you combine Mondays, Buddies, Curries and Quiz? MURB QUIZ. Happy now?*

So. Seeing as our beloved /u/Verbify is re-creating that heady feeling of summer 2011 with Bar 55, though? Well really, one would have to be a dedicated Surbologist to give a full answer, but basically it's London but with more shrubs. I think it might technically be in Surrey. It's inside the M25 though, a fact that often reassures.

OK, and you do not have to possess Surbitonianity. (Look at me, for instance, I'm going because it's half way between London and Woking.) A taste for curry might be good though, because afterwards we can go to the East India restaurant - YAY! - where the food is half price if you pay cash. It got a great write-up in *The Surbitonian*, and apparently isn't a money-laundering front at all!

I've booked the downstairs area which can accommodate 15 - 20 people with 2 gaming tables and 2 consoles set up for people to play. Should we get more people the upstairs area has 3 or 4 more tables and another couple of consoles.

The bar already has a pretty decent selection of board games available to play, Gears of War, King of Tokyo, Resident Evil Deck Building Game, Battlestar Galactica, plenty of others. People can of course bring whatever they want to play themselves though.

Video game wise I reckon we can set up a Tekken or Street Fighter Tournament of some sort and duke it out to determine the champion (it'll be me).

For those of you who just like to drink (you know who you are) there's also bottled beers at I think £2.50

For those of you wanting food I'm not sure the do have cakes and ice creams as well as offers on meals

Ordinarily there'd be a min fee to cover the use of the space

While you can of course rock up on the night I'd appreciate shouts of 'In!' if you're coming so I can gauge whether this is going to be worth it or not.

* CPR Training

&gt; Join nurses from the British Heart Foundation to find out all you need to know about CPR to leap into action and save a life.

&gt; Have British Heart Foundation advertising campaigns have shocked the public into looking after the old ticker...

* ... and much more!

Mubz usually starts at around 8ish

A few redditors have mentioned to me about putting together a 5-7 aside astroturf football game, everyone is welcome if you want to play! Its would just be a bit of a friendly kickabout for fun and fitness, maybe followed by a cheeky pint or two if you can look the opposition in the face afterwards.


If we do have the interest I would be happy enough to book and arrange it, let me know if would be interested, what day of playing would suit you best, and what location would be best. I'll try my best to find something that suits :)


On location and times, Kensington or Whitechapel. Also peak times for games are weekday evenings after work, so booking these times also tends to cost a bit more, whereas weekends are cheaper. 


Anyway


P.S. To let you know what level of ability I am at and show I'm no George Best

The key facts:

* We'll be looking for a catered chalet in one of the popular resorts in either France or Austria (Though Italy and Switzerland could also be options)
* In a majority of Chalets, but only for six days, as staff have Sundays off. Airport transfers are covered in a majority of cases.
* The accommodation can vary between £250 -&gt; £800 alone. Flights can vary depending on airline
* Lift passes can be almost £200 for seven days.
* You **SHOULD** get travel insurance that covers winter sports. This can be an additional charge on top of your regular travel insurance.
* The date of the first week of February was chosen due to the French school holidays falling later in the month
* The resorts cater for all skiing types, you can, but I imagine that would get very boring quickly.
* The UK is **NOT** part of the [Schengen Zone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area) which allows visa holders to pass unrestricted within. You would need a Schengen visa to be granted by the country we decide to fly into. EU passport holders will still need their passports.

For the spiel.

Scotch Malt Whisky Society is a non-exclusive private club (i.e. you pay £100 for membership

http://www.smws.co.uk

They've got a deal with most of the major distillers to bottle unique casks. Most bottlings are only in the range of 200-300 bottles

Friday's all whisky drams are capped at £6 (except for Tartan at £24.50). Few Friday's ago I enjoyed a very nice 34 year old Speyside Lossie from Glen Moray - for £6 (retail price of bottle £160).

http://www.smws.co.uk/venues/19_Greville_Street

Here's a guide to the codes. 

http://www.jdawiseman.com/papers/trivia/smws-distillery-numbers.html

The bottles are normally numbered with distillery.number of cask sold.

BTW, it's totally fine as well. The staff know their stuff and have managed to convert a few drinkers into loving whisky.

I'll be there from 6pm. I can only sign in 2 more guests, all the staff know me and chances are there will be a few other members there that I know who will be able to sign you in.  Worse case it's a £10 cover.

This is shotgun shooting against moving clay targets in a variety of different stands.  The only shooting you can easily do in the UK is with a shotgun.  No handguns at all and rifle shooting is fairly tricky to get into.

It is not cheap.  For a shared hour lesson

Full price list over here.

I've taken a few people down who have never shot before.  They walk you through everything

They provide everything

Bisley shooting ground is interesting.  Last month when I was down a re-inactment group was shooting a German WWI machine gun.  And the armed police response unit were practising with their Heckler &amp; Koch submachine guns.

It's an hour drive there.  Bisley is 30 miles west of London.   First 40 minutes of london traffic suck, shoot for an hour or two, then come back.  

I doubt there will be much interest

Went down today and chatted to them, this is members rates, normally it would cost you £120, so I'm saving you money :)  We do a 20 shot mini comp to pick the best shot.  And do a driven game shoot at the end.  4 people line up, they fire clays over you head while you all shoot at once.

Time will be 11am-1pm for the shoot.  Need to be there at 10:30am.  If you're getting a lift you need to be at mine by 9:15am (I'm a 15 minute walk from Crystal Palace Station, you're out of luck.  Also need to confirm exact numbers the Wednesday(8th Feb) prior.  If you pull out after then and no-one takes your place, you owe me £40.

The game starts at 7pm and we can arrive any time up to 8pm but let's aim for 7pm anyway. We'll swop phone numbers to meet up anyway

**Don't forget to bring a print out of your ticket.**

Here are the details from the organisers:

**Start:** 

The game starts at 7pm at [a secret location]. We release players in groups of six to eight people, arrive early. If you don't mind what time you are released, you can arrive any time up to 8pm. 

**What to wear &amp; bring:** 

A mobile phone is useful to find friends and ask for help if you get lost. Some money is good. This is a game not a race, stand up to exposure to zombie gore* while keeping your phone and valuables safe then you are getting close. Oh, also, we love costumes, so feel free to let rip with your favourite zombie survivor character.

**Weapons**

No weapons! This is a game of tag. There is no fighting back, frying pans, cosmic death rays, throwing stars or cutlasses etc.",,False,,True,t3_ls445

* The journey is about 280 miles.  Plan to do it in 5 days, plus take an extra day in Brittany saying hi to our cross-channel cousins, then a day in Paris before taking the Eurostar back (or longer if you want).

* Some people are talking about driving alongside

* Probably best if you have a bike

* You have 6 months to be fit enough to do it!  But as mentioned above this isn't the tour de france

* Staying in BnBs along the way - it's a quite popular route so there are regular cycling-friendly spots.  Another possibility is pack tents in the car and do it the cheap way

We already have a rollcall!  Though this is all tentative and just looking for discussion

It looks like [Richmond Park](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=&amp;sll=51.436247,-0.272942&amp;spn=0.062923,0.154324&amp;z=13) it is, it is fairly hilly but we can go at the pace of the slowest person. 

Rough Start Time - Approx 1000 -1100 meet in Richmond Park

Meetup Point - Probably Roehampton Gate [map](http://www.theaa.com/images/travel/maps/cycles/London_Cycle_Map8.gif).

Lunch - Aim for around 1400 in Richmond on the bank of the Thames.  You can either bring or buy there

Distance/Route - Undecided currently, and even for beginners, at an easy pace, this is quite dooable.

Bikes and kit - Boris Bikes have been mentioned, especially when paired up against normal bikes (mountain/hybrid/road).  Bike hire might be possible if you want to. I have a road bike, so the route will be mainly in very well worn tracks of roads/paths within the park.  I don't have much kit in the way of puncture repair, pumps or spare tubes, so if someone has, it would be awesome if you could bring them along.

Getting there - Closest Tube is East Putney on the District (just checked and the District is running this weekend).  It's a 2.5 mile cycle from there to the Roehampton Gate.  I think Barnes Station might be a bit closer

Safety - Helmets if you have them

There are often a few who will eat there

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks

Now

I'm in talks with two rehearsal studios, so that means loads of room and both of these studios are located within 10 minutes of walking distance from Old Street station.

I'm making a list of attendees, and I'll PM you with the details once they are available.

1. xska (drums)

* not question if your art skills are 'good enough' to attend this event (if you want to draw live models in a safe environment

The South London board game evening is striking early this month! We're having a night of joy and boardgames beginning at 5.30 PM on Sunday May 12 to Oxfam bookshop on Kingston's Old London Road (near the fallen phone boxes).

FAQ

**I've never played a board game in my life - is it gonna be safe?** 

Sure

**I'm a beast at boardgames! Which ones do you guys play?**

Depends on what people bring in. Usually it's stuff that can be grasped quickly: Munchkin, San Juan, Settlers of Catan.

**Do I need to bring in anything?**

We have tea and coffee in the shop as well as some biscuits

**Can I bring along some friends of mine?**

Yeah, so I know if I need to get any more tables/chairs in.

I wasn't thinking of a lunch somewhere at the end after this ride (mainly because I don't want to carry my lock around with me) but if enough people would be interested in such a ride I'm happy to change the plan.

In terms of equipment and other things to bring - bike, drinks, a snack of some kind, waterproof (for those sudden rain showers), pump and spare inner tube (for any unfortunate incidents) and any thing else you might take along with you on a bike ride. Hopefully between us we should have enough to deal with most eventualities.

http://www.inthehiddencity.com/

Given a series of clues and you go from location to location in London as you solve them (including pub breaks).

http://www.inthehiddencity.com/how-it-works/

£16 per team.  I'm aiming at team size of 4-5.  Enough for creative problem solving

The Clue Hunt we shall do is Bar Breaks.

http://www.inthehiddencity.com/bar-breaks/

It suits us the best I think.  One 30 minute and one 45 minute pub break during it.  If this does prove to be fun

(12 clues

We shall start at 2:30pm on the dot.  Meet up at 2pm in the National Gallery Cafe.  My mobile is Brad 07760389766.  If you ain't met me

National Gallery

I'll prob get there around 12 and wander around the National Gallery.  I love the National Gallery.  None of this modern art crap.  So ping me earlier if you want to join me.

So we should finish up by 6:30 pm or so.  Leaving time to do something in the evening.  I expect some of us will find a nearby bar for a few follow up drinks.

If you've never joined us before, we can make the teams slightly bigger.  But telling me you're in now, allows me to add another team now.

&gt;Jonathan Haidt, and why it is the defining characteristic of humans, Haidt will show why we cannot dismiss the views of others as mere stupidity or moral corruption. Our moral roots run much deeper than we realize. We are hardwired not just to be moral, but moralistic and self-righteous. From advertising to politics, morality influences all aspects of behaviour. It is the key to understanding everybody. It explains why some of us are liberals, others conservatives. It is often the difference between war and peace. It is also why we are the only species that will kill for an ideal.

&gt;Haidt argues we are always talking past each other because we are appealing to different moralities: it is not just about justice and fairness - for some people authority, or learn some moral psychology. His hope is that ultimately we can cooperate with those whose morals differ from our own.

Here has better directions to get there:

http://bakerstreetastro.org.uk/info/location/

Basically near the zoo entrance at the northern end of Regents park there will be one gate open.  There are lights along the path and a few people walking back and forth so is fairly safe.  Also one of the amateur astronomers who helps organise the event is a copper.  The cafe is open for coffee

The only way the event is cancelled is if it is pissing down rain at 6pm.  Otherwise if it's cloudy it will go ahead.  Last time was all overcast so all we did was target the telescopes at the BT tower and an apartment block nearby...  But I got to talk telescopes &amp; stars with people so I was happy :)

1308252913.0,i1hg5,Imperial War Museum - Sunday 19th June 2011 ,Stux,9,2,48,"Hi

So I propose we meet at 1pm at the McDonalds in Waterloo station

Few points I'd like you all to read before any of you motherfuckers decide to sign up.

1.  This is a museum meet up. That means you should be interested in what we are going to see as it is quite long and in depth.

2. It takes about 3 hours to go around properly. Be prepared for this

**3. There are only two points.**

I only put this here because of the fact we never got around to seeing anything at the science museum meets. This was due to lack of interest and conflict of interests.

Given the great response we got from people wanting to play dodgeball (in the dodgeball thread)[http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/fmkxx/official_dodgeball_thread/] and the number of people that have said that they can do the 18th I've booked the court at [T47](http://t47.co.uk/t47-sports-venue/) for 8pm.

[T47](http://t47.co.uk/t47-sports-venue/) is located ""just 2 minutes walk from London Bridge"" [here](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=t47,+UK&amp;aq=&amp;sll=51.503079,-0.084142&amp;sspn=0.006545,0.016265&amp;g=t47,+47+St.+Thomas+Street,+Southwark,+London+SE1+3QX,&amp;hnear=London+SE1+3QX

**Edit**: We're at 18 at the moment and while I expect one or two people may drop out at the last minute due to un-forseen circumstances it looks like we'll be subbing people in/out during the game so that everyone gets to play. Whatever system we use we'll try to make it fair for everyone.

**Edit 2** Down to 15 players due to things coming up at the last minute. If anyone can't make it let me know.

Hi Everyone

I'm going to be wandering around Central London tomorrow taking photos and I figure what better way than to do it with some fellow photogs from reddit. Here's a list of places I plan on hitting. I know it's a bit cliche but it's mostly the tourist stuff along the thames river. I'd love to have a London native that knows some places off the beaten path.

   * London Dungeon
   * St Jame's Park
   * The pirate ship 
   * Southwark Cathedral

I was thinking about meeting up around 11am and starting the photo walk about 11:30am. It looks like starting out at the London Bridge or Tower Hill underground station and working our way north along the river would be best. Also if any of the places mentioned above are not worth the time please do let me know.

FAQ

I've never played a board game in my life - will it be alright?

The majority of people who came along last week had never touched a game (spare the dreaded Monopoly). Come down, which is excellent. Go for it!

I'm a beast at boardgames! Which ones I'll be dominating this time?

Last week we had Cards Against Humanity, the Resistance and Settlers of Catan. This week I'm adding Munchkin, Ticket to Ride, Citadels, San Juan, the Games of Thrones Board Game. If you've got your own that you wish to crush us with (literally or figuratively), bring it along!

Do I need to bring in anything?

A few pounds/guineas/knuts/credits/groats for the barkeep to provide you with quenching ales

Can I bring along some friends of mine?

The more the merrier. Literally. Bring as many as possible. Willing or not.

Are you sick of not being able to play magic on a monday?

Do you want to play against redditors IRL?

Come along to Farringdon at 7pm to play in a pub. I've got a box of m14, I've got reddit on my phone.

EDIT : So we're clear

EDIT 2 : Bring your own sleeves.

EDIT3 : Pricing - Taken from a later post :

I'm not going to sell for profit. I bought a box of 36 from magic madhouse (just under £80[£79.95]), or for £10, playing a 4 booster draft with 1 pack for the top 4. Or £10 each with the ""finals"" being sealed. But I'd rather decide that in person.

I've yet to play a free draft though.

It, but will most likely cost more so I highly recommend buying in advance.

There are a whole number of bands playing throughout the day

XII Boar - [Smoking Bones](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_Ye8YuWiQc)

A Trust Unclean - [Cryogenic Slumber Party](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJiQNgXbjEA), there is no doubt they will put on a great show.

Reign Of Fury - [World Detonation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLpn7j8AeWw), fast trash metal. This isn't even the full version of the song on the CD, which is even more awesome.

Gravil - [Enemy Within](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WrjhA5PpLQ)

L Sol Tace - [Army Of Darkness](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfE8BHPjnUE) fantastic groove metal. 

Ancient Ascendant - [Driven By The Dark](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwdcKWiFCnE), and have also toured with Enslaved. I have seen these guys before, and they put on a brilliant show.

Collapse -[Acolyte](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv1965gd4EQ)

Right, however I am not 100% sure if the bands will start instantly, sometimes there can be 20-30 minutes to get everyone in, sometimes they start straight away. XII Boar will be the first band on. I'm not sure how long the night will last for, previous gigs I have been to finish at different times.

The Camden Underworld is located behind the Worlds End Pub

If you plan on drinking, but you will be allowed to leave and be readmitted as much as you like, your wrists will be stamped on entry.

Anyone coming who has never been to an extreme music gig before or is not really acquainted with extreme music, having once been a newbie myself, the extreme music community is very welcoming.

I will hopefully be with a couple of mates, and drinking, though not too much. I have long hair and will be wearing a black band t shirt, you will get that joke if you go.

**IMPORTANT**: to my knowledge there is no wheelchair access to the Camden Underworld

Don't hesitate to ask questions

Edit: those who replied who are in, I'll have access on my phone.

FAQ

**I've never played a board game in my life - will it be alright?**

Sure

**I'm a beast at boardgames! Which ones do you guys play?**

Depends on what people bring in. Usually it's stuff that can be grasped quickly and played within an hour or two: Munchkin, San Juan, Settlers of Catan.

**Do I need to bring in anything?**

We have tea and coffee in the shop as well as some biscuits

**Can I bring along some friends of mine?**

Yeah, so I know if I need to get any more tables/chairs in.

There are often a few of us who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week

*If you're very very shy don't hesitate to text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks

Since after the above people still asked...

I will be arriving into London from Brisbane at stupid o'clock in the morning and know that if I don't make daytime plans I will go straight to bed on arrival and make my body clock confused and upset.

**Charitable Donation:** Also I'm asking each full participant to [donate £10 to support Bowel Cancer UK via JustGiving](http://justgiving.com/randomlylondon). If you're coming for part of the time £5 is fine. Please of course give more if you can afford it. (For more see FAQ)

**FAQ**

**Q:** Why is this held on a Friday and not a Saturday?

**A:** The circle line pub crawl is almost impossible to do on a Saturday due to the number of pubs closed in The City. Friday is the next best option.

**Q:** Why aren't we doing the Hammersmith Branch?

**A:** In 2009 the Circle Line stopped being an actual circle. However

**Q:** Is there any walking involved?

**A:** My original plan was to walk the whole route myself (along with anyone else who wished to join me) and have everyone else go by tube. This was an idiotic idea. Trying to coordinate two groups would be next to impossible given the level of drinking. Instead we'll likely walk between some stations as it can be faster than taking the Tube in certain situations (e.g. Monument

**Q:** Will you make long winded speeches about the tube?

**A:** Only if you misbehave (or want me too).

**Q:** Is there anything I can do to help?

**A:** Thanks for asking and yes there is. If you're coming along for the whole thing I'm asking that you [make a £10 donation towards my Tube Challenge for Bowel Cancer UK](http://justgiving.com/randomlylondon) (£5 if joining part-way through). In a recent r/LSC survey people said they wanted to be more charitable

It's not mandatory

I've picked this charity because both my grandparents on my Dad’s side of the family died from Bowel Cancer

Bed Peace for Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde*
David Mabb
18.00-21.30
In the display cabinet to the right of the William Morris Bed there is a small pamphlet called Chants for Socialists published by the Socialist League in 1885. In it Morris “provided fiery new words to well-known popular songs and hymns: accessibility and familiarity were more important than musical originality”.  Morris’ radical socialism and disenchantment with parliamentary politics developed from his opposition to the Tories’ support for Turkey’s war against Russian Tsarist forces in the late 1870s and the eventual betrayal of the anti-war movement by the Liberals especially when they returned to office in 1880.

John Lennon’s and Yoko Ono’s ‘Bed In’ (1969) was one of the most significant (public) events that took place in a bed during the last century. John and Yoko spent many days in bed in several cities during their honeymoon as a protest against the Vietnam War. As well as having a constant stream of visitors and conducting many interviews

In Bed Peace, will be projected onto the headboard for five minutes. The video would then start again.
