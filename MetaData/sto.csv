**WHERE:** Bajor

**HOW:** Simply reply to this post with your entry, so be sure to read them carefully. They are as follows:

* You can only enter for one (1) lockbox/lobi store ship. So pick whichever one you think you're going to love the most

Seems pretty simple. I'm sure somebody out there is already misinterpreting them

A couple of final notes, and I'm not going to penalize you for it if your schedule doesn't allow you to be online. I'll mail all the prizes that I couldn't award in person after the event.

I don't know if you (the nonspecific reader) have been following the various issues that RA and /r/STO members have been having recently with STO and Cryptic, and she lost a bunch of stuff - including a Recluse carrier. If memory serves, it took them over a month to get back to her ticket - and that was only after she posted a rant on this very subreddit. Even then, all was not well.

PWE support told our K-Vox that a rollback was the only way. So she'd lose everything that she had gained in the month since coming back, it was that or suffer the loss of a Recluse, so she accepted. And then... nothing happened. Eventually, she grew frustrated, and sent a rather colorful message to PWE support. Fin.

Whether you know this story or not

**Any devs that happen across this:** Understand that I don't want to knock on the work you guys do. I love STO, support an organization that treats its customers - paying and not - like they're not worth the time to even respond to. I have, in the past, run many large giveaways through this subreddit, containing mainly lockbox and lobi ships financed by my wallet. I have spent more thousands on this than I care to think about, and I would love to continue doing so. But I cannot.

As long as Cryptic and PWE refuse to even acknowledge this is an issue, that if you consider yourself a player with integrity, you do the same. I regret that I must refrain thusly, but as much as I want to give money to Cryptic, I cannot give it to the cash machine that PWE appears to be.

Very Rare Matter-Antimatter Warp Cores have five possible traits. The Type of core is a Power Level buff, the third is a battery-style Capacitor power, and finally a Slipstream/Transwarp Buff.

**Type** determines which subsystem gets a power bonus and capacity buff.

* *Overcharged* adds to Auxiliary.
* *Hyper-Injection* adds to Engines.
* *Field Stabilizing* adds to Shields.

**Skill Buffs** add +X to a specific Engineering skill section:

* *[Eff]* - Starship Warp Core Efficiency
* *[Coi]* - Starship Driver Coil
* *[EPS]* - Starship Electro-Plasma Systems 
* *[Rep]* - Starship Subsystem Repair
* *[Bat]* - Starship Batteries
* *[SEP]* - Starship Engine Performance

**Power Level Buffs** add +X to a specific power level capacity (Weapons, Auxiliary), and add +X% of the affected system to another system. For example, [E-&gt;W] would add +15 power to Engine power capacity, and +7.5% of Engine power to Weapons. These are denoted by an *[X-&gt;Y]* modifier.

**Capacitors** boost a selected power level for a small amount of time. Basically, E for Engines, S for Shields, W for Weapons).

**Slipstream/Transwarp Buffs** affect your Slipstream/Transwarp with one of four modifiers:

* *[SST]* - +X% to Slipstream Turnrate
* *[SSS]* - +X to Slipstream Speed
* *[SSR]* - +X% to Slipstream Cooldown Rate
* *[Trans]* - +X% to Transwarp Cooldown Rate

So

* +7.5 additional Shield Power
* +16.2 Starship Warp Core Efficiency
* Adds 7.5% of your Weapon power to your Shield power as bonus power.
* Weapon Capacitor: Repairs disabled weapons systems
* +20% Turnrate while in Slipstream.

Last night


_____


Ausmonauts


@Destiny77 (Known to most as ""Iceman"") has passed away.


Iceman came to the Ausmonauts from Federation Special Ops, the very last thing one would see in Ker'rat was that name above Iceman's infamous Bird of Prey - ""Talk to the Hand"".


It was a fitting name for a player and a friend who took perverse and even delightful pleasure in besting the PVP community's 'elite' where they thought they were safest. On style and class


Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.


To Iceman; fair winds


R.I.P. my friend...


___________________


The Ausmonauts made tribute to Iceman by converging on his favoured stomping grounds (Ker'rat) in strength. Our ships all bore only one name - ""Destiny77"". For a very long time, but he loved STO and his fleet until the very end - and we will dearly miss him.


We ended the night's observance of Iceman's passing the only way we knew how: a round of fleet PVP with the kill count set to a fitting 77. The way we see it


We gathered on the starbase at the end of the evening


We shot for the moon and made Tier 5 - and in the same breath


We plan to honour him a little more permanently

While this is definitely great news, to *read the subreddit rules*. Not every [gaming subreddit](/r/gaming) enforces rules, but [some of the better ones](/r/games) do, and I count r/sto among the better ones.

**All rules apply when making a new submission and when commenting.** This is all in an effort to keep this subreddit as friendly as possible. I know many of you are great people but there will always be bad grapes

Lastly I want to say that I have very little patience for vicious personal attacks on other users. I understand that sometimes we get into heated arguments, and repeat offenders will be banned. It's also a good idea to extend this rule to RedditChat as well.

This new patch seems to be the last straw for me. Instead of just adding progression in terms of gear

With the changes to EDC/Omega Reputation, some mk x/XI blues and we are golden.

With the lockbox ships

I may be jumping the gun here

Everything in this game requires dilithium. Crafting, reputation ""missions"", and now even Doff recruitment/grinding. I'm not going to spend hours grinding dilithium so I can spend hours grinding romulan marks. These two systems should be independent of each other to offer incentive to do one or the other. If I were a fresh Vice Admiral, I should be able to decide if I want to grind romulan Rep or omega Rep and not be penalized or forced to do both concurrently. Or make it so after completing one, I can advance to the next one and not worry about the first at all! Personally I think that leads to too much dead content though.

And back to Rep

Look

And who the fuck thought charging huge amounts of dilithium for DoFF reassignment/general recruitment was a good idea? You should be fired.

TLDR: stop adding dilithium sinks without increasing the dilithium gain and cap. Cryptic

**The Seventh Biannual Giveaway Bonanza of Great Justice**
----------
----------

It's that time again, and there being a wider selection of top-tier prizes.

**New Giveaway Rules**
----------
----------


 - Each person is now only allowed to enter for a single ship. I may adjust this as entries roll in, regardless of where it came from or how much it's worth. This means you can't enter for both a timeship and a timeship shuttle, it's one or the other. Again, I may change this, depending on how things pan out.

 - As previously, you're welcome to approach me directly, but I'd much rather you not snag an expensive ship and sell it, depriving someone else of something they might have gotten use out of.

 - Also as previously, it's a great deal of fun. **I'll edit this post with the time, date, and location once I've figured that out.** Right now it looks like we're talking next week, probably Friday, after 9PM EST.

 - Finally, unless you have it in your flair. Just tell me what you want to enter for, I'll be sorting through it as we go.

**The Prizes**

1353367956.0,13h78z,Nequencia Alpha Trading Guide - Quick way to earn 60 Romulan Marks,existemi,38,5,35,"Hey All

Found this quick grind a few days ago and it's helped rack up an easy 60 Romulan Marks every day.

For the daily **Tau Dewa Sector Patrol Mission**

**There are three scenarios that I've come across and here are the easiest solutions:**

**Scenario 1:** You receive **Isomagnetic EPS Conduit** and need to trade for **Plasma Manifold**

* Pakled - Alpha-Matrix Compositor
* Saurian - Reaction Assembly
* Rinketian - Plasma Relay
* Pakled - Matter Injector
* Saurian - Plasma Manifold

**Scenario 2:** You receive **Reel of Fiber Optic Cable** and need to trade for **Plasma Coolant**

* Kibo Cri'box - Isomagnetic EPS Conduit
* Pakled - Alpha-Matrix Compositor
* Saurian - Reaction Assembly
* Rinketian - Plasma Relay
* Pakled - Matter Injector
* Saurian - Plasma Manifold
* Benyentic - Plasma Coolant

**Scenario 3:** You receive **Manual Sealing Stem Bolts** and need to trade for **Plasma Conversion Sensor**

* Orion - Isomagnetic EPS Conduit 
* Orion - Phase Compensator 
* Tellarite  - Plasma Infuser 
* Rinketian  - Power Converter 
* Ferengi  - Solar Energy Converter 
* Kibo Cri`box - Plasma Conversion Sensors

You can burn through the sequence in less than 90 seconds and have 20% of the Patrol Mission done. Wash

I've made an excel sheet with each merchant's trade options

* Before about level 40, ship, etc.  Feel free to have fun and experiment.  However, **silver (non-subscribing) players can only respec their skills by purcasing a one-time-use token from the cash shop**.  So that’s something you may want to take some care with.

1374939325.0,1j5wf6,New to 50? Read me! A guide to being a new 50 that I have been working on for the past few weeks.,KunduzCity2012,41,4,19,"So if you are reading this, you travel through this sort of closed loop pipeline where you don’t hear about any of the endgame stuff in STO

* RedditChat – Type /channel_join RedditChat. Enough said. Hundreds of Redditors all in the same chat channel grouping together, so there will someone available to answer your questions pretty much 24/7. Even if you have no interest in joining a Reddit fleet, I highly recommend that you join this channel. 

* Fleet – Get in a fleet! There are many fleets available. Reddit has two Federation fleets: REDdit Alert (RA) and Reddit Star Empire (RSE). RA is often full and also has a complete starbase so there are less donation opportunities for fleet credits. More on fleet credits in a moment. RSE is the spillover Federation fleet and offers more opportunities to obtain fleet credits (fleddits). It is important to know that RA and RSE are essentially the same fleet: officers are the same, for the Klingon players, there is the House of Snoo (Snoo). Snoo has a different ruleset than RA/RSE but is not too different. Joining any of the Reddit fleets is as easy as joining the RedditChat channel and asking for an invite.

* Fleet Holdings – The bottom at the bottom right of your map is the fleet window. You can also push CTRL+G. Each fleet has a Dilithium Mine, you can see that there are projects running. You can donate to these projects: you can donate fleet marks (a form of currency, more on this later), duty officers (you may or may not be familiar with duty officers or DOFFs yet), commodities, experience points (expertise, used as currency beyond level 50) and dilithium (more on dilithium later). In exchange for donating to these projects

    Fleddits are a form of currency needed to buy high level items from the fleet starbase and embassy. Often, shields, engines, etc. It is important to get into a fleet and donate in order to stockpile the fleddits you will need. Once you donate and receive fleddits, they are yours forever, even if you leave the fleet or take a leave of absence. They belong to you, not the fleet. The Reddit fleets require a minimum number of donations to be promoted within the fleet, the fleet holdings offer many passive abilities

* Duty Officer System (DOFFing) – You’ve probably heard this a lot. When I was leveling up and sitting in the RedditChat channel, assign them to active space/ground rosters and send them on missions. The overview tab shows you a lot of data about your DOFFs. You can have a maximum of 400 if you buy more slots with Zen, which I recommend. More on Zen later. The overview tab also shows you the commendation levels. All categories reward you with a token to buy DOFFs from a personnel officer (Starfleet Academy or First City? for Klingon players) each time you level. Rank 1 and 2 let you buy a free green (uncommon) quality DOFF. Rank 3 lets you buy a blue DOFF (rare) and Rank 4 lets you buy a purple (very rare) DOFF. Some of the categories also give you additional abilities. Diplomacy unlocks locations for you to Transwarp to. At Rank 3, you also get Diplomatic Immunity (FED) or Maruading (KDF) which lets you travel to enemy sectors to obtain different DOFF missions. Engineering, Medical, and Military let you replicate emergency hologram DOFFs. 

    Under assignments, many DOFF missions which reward you various types of commendation XP. You can also get dilithium ore, other DOFFs, expertise, trade goods and equipment. You can fabricate warp cores and singularity cores with your engineering section. If you get a critical, you can obtain very rare (purple) equipment that will sells for millions on the exchange! Your DOFFs have traits that will increase your chance for success and critical success while reducing the chance for failure or disaster. Common (white) DOFFs can die during disasters. Green, blue and purple DOFFs won’t die,000 experience in a commendation category (Rank 4)

* DOFF Star Cluster missions – There are star clusters around the galaxy. They are off the edges of the sector blocks. Zenas Expanse (ZE), D’kel Star Clsuter (DK), Eridon Nebula (EN) and Azlesa Expanse (AZ) in Klingon space. Eridan Belt (EB), Khazan Cluster (KC) and Afherri Nebula (AN) in Romulan space. Finally, B’Tran Cluster (BC) in Borg space (Gamma Orionis Block). These star clusters have 7 part DOFF mission chains. They require colonists that you can buy from the exchange or obtain from the Resettle Colonists DOFF mission found commonly on your current map. At the end of these 7 part chains, you unlock repeatable “Support XXX Cluster/Belt/Nebula” missions in these zones. These DOFF missions last 4 hours and can be performed once per 24 hours. However, they are not always guaranteed to be available. There is a spreadsheet that people corroborate on to track these missions (bit.ly/doffs1). These missions are popular because on a critical success

* Marks/Reputation System – There are 4 types of marks. Fleet Marks (flarks) were mentioned previously. They are obtained in a variety of ways: from PvE missions (more on that in a second), Epohh raising on New Romulus, ground missions on Nukara Prime, etc. These marks are used as currency in the reputation system. If you push “U” on your keyboard and click the Reputation tab, you will be looking at the Rep system. You can see that it laid out very similar to the Fleet Holding system. You can queue and fill projects that reward you with a particular reputation. The system goes from 0 to 100,000 with five tiers along the way. Each tier lets you choose an ability from that particular faction and locks items you can queue and donate to in order to obtain them. The reputation system is a very good source of equipment. There are two reputation granting mission: one rewards 800 rep and one rewards 2000 rep. So it takes about 36 days to reach maximum reputation. The projects require reputation marks and various commodities purchasable from commodities brokers. This will be a big drain in your energy credit (EC) budget, but rewards you with abilities and the potential to unlock very rare MK XII gear for both space &amp; ground. The sooner you start on these

* PvE – The PvE “endgame” in STO revolves around Special Task Forces or STFs. There are many of these in the game. They reward marks, the reward, and the average time. You can do these by queuing blind (entering a pick up group or PUG) by that is not recommended. There are always people in the RedditChat channel willing to run STFs with you. This is the main source of dilithium and marks in the game. 

* Dilithium – Dilithium is a required currency for almost all purchases in STO. Gear from the reputation system costs dilithium and reputation marks while gear from the fleet store costs dilithium and fleet credits. There are two types of dilithium: ore and refined dilithium. Ore is very plentiful: you get it from STFs, the better. Refined dilithium is also used to donate to fleet holding projects. 

* Energy credits – The main currency of STO. You get this as rewards during story missions, XI and XII gear from STFs and Foundry missions that you can sell on the exchange. EC is very weird – when you need it for reputation commodities, you always seem short. Then once you’re done with the reputation system, you have too much and there isn’t much to buy. 

* Zen – The microtransaction currency of STO. You can get Zen by selling your refined dilithium on the dilithium exchange. Lifetime subscribers get 500/month stipend. Otherwise, more inventory space, more bank space, more DOFF slots, refined dilithium, special DOFFs, BOFFs, etc etc. STO is a game where a surprising amount of people pay for Zen although recently some Redditors have embargoed the system until the customer service/ticket system is changed to be more productive. 

* Transwarp – This is overlooked a lot. I didn’t know about it until well after 50. I thought it was only an ability that certain ships had. The button below the beam out button on the left side of your map is the Transwarp button. You can Transwarp across the galaxy to various locations. You can unlock more locations by achieving higher Diplomacy ranks through the DOFF systems. Some ships like the cargo freighter

I hadn't logged on to STO in a week or two, then got stuck during the combat in the promenade. I gave up, aborted the mission, and lazily went to ESD to pick up some regenerators and a more appropriate kit from the bank. Of course, I got carried away with abusing strangers using my Thermal Dampener and Party Popper (if you've ever seen me in ESD or DS9 you probably know how much I enjoy those items) and ended up goofing off until the message came up: ""Attention Captains: The Shard will be coming down in 30 minutes for routine maintenance"" or whatever.

*Holy. Shit.*

It all came to me at once: It was 11:30 PM here in Oregon

I initiated a tactical ass-hauling to DS9, some were just chittilychatting about the event. In my drug-addled state it probably seemed like fifty times more exciting than it actually was. Anyway, I realized there was no way that I could possibly destroy the Jem'Hadar fleet *and* turn in the mission in just 5 minutes... Until Liza burst into the battle in the most badass way possible, and we both kicked everyone's ass in a crygasm of simultaneous feelings of brotherhood and impossible pressure.

It was beautiful. Where there were once intimidating purple battleships, MANLY tear rolled down my cheek in the midst of our sudden and super exciting victory.

*But I didn't have the Shard yet.*

I beamed down to DS9

So in the next few weeks

1) Shipyard/Military V

2) Starbase V

As you are no-doubt aware

Due to this

For now

Some recommendations to save up dilithium:

1) Trade in 5 contraband for 2000 dilithium from the security officer on ESD

2) Do Foundry missions. The mission ""Left to Die"" is a featured mission and can be done quickly. Do it with a full team of 5 and you'll each get a significant amount of dilithium. Otherwise

3) STFs! Get dilithium from doing STFs and

4) Starbase 24. 480 dilithium per run.

5) Deferi Dailies. Get about 2200 dilithium daily for doing it.

6) Eta Eridani Dailies. Distress call at the Alhena System, and, if you have 10 computer core fragments, destroy captured vessel at Donatu.

Nonetheless

See you online!

1360325087.0,184lm5,Poor Man's EC Collecting Guide,RockyCoon,41,4,50,"Here's a method I use to get a lot of EC in a month (10 Mil+)

* Get a Federation

* Get yourself an escort of some sort. (Advanced Mirror Escorts and Patrol Mirror Escorts are cheap on the Exchange

* Go to Drozana Station (for all factions.)

* Open the Foundry. (Shortcut Key is 'J' and hitting the Foundry Tab at the top of the window.). Look for the Mission called 'One and Done' via the 'Browse All' Tab on the Sidebar

* This is an easy mission that also qualifies for basic foundry rewards.

* ***Alternate Mission:*** There is an alternate mission called 'Looting Range FED' and 'Looting Range KDF' that I find more quicker once your ship is powerful enough and can make a lot of powerful, the start locations can be found on a terminal outside of the transporters on Earth Spacedock and just by the transporters in First City.

* Do the mission. An escort/DPS Ship makes it fly by quickly. Complete it to the end

* You should now have a crapload of commons, if you got lucky. Increasing your difficulty to 'Elite' will increase your chances of blues and purples, and possibly higher mark gear.

* The Bartender on Drozana should give you 50% sell rate. Sell your junk there! If you want to know if a vendor gives you a 50% rate, they buy at 50%.
 
* You should make anywhere between 500, depending how lucky you are, by selling to the vendor directly. Sometimes it may be less, and sometimes it may be way more. (My personal best has been a 980,000 EC run so far.). Shields and deflector dishes are the ones worth the most selling this way. 

* Certain items are worth more on the exchange, and are usually heavy dual cannons with desirable effects (Like Doubled up [Acc] modifiers,.) or tactical consoles of desirable weapon types such as phasers or disruptors. 

* You can repeat this until you stop getting expertise for killing ships, you can switch to it and continue to farm loot for EC.

* I add this to my dailies list when I do dailies. It's a good way to make a chunk of change fairly quickly and meet your daily cap in one run.


A Smooth Easy 450

* **I found out recently that you can get an uncommon Science Console - Field Generator,** easy as a re-playable mission reward.* These don't drop at all in the drop system, being only craft-able or via the Powered Alien Artifact Doff Assignment, so it makes them moderately valuable.* It's a KDF mission called 'Friend or Foe' and one of the earlier missions in the game. It's quick, short and easy, and replays will yield the Mark Level Appropriate Uncommon Generator. They currently, as of this posting,000 to 500

Another Method to get a lot of EC in one go is:

1360441585.0,187iw9,[Announcement] RA Fleet Rules Part 1: General rules for Reddit Alert,thecipher,37,8,11,"---

**PART 1: GENERAL FLEET GUIDELINES**

---

**GENERAL RULES FOR REDDIT ALERT**

* Don't be a jackass. Should be self-explanatory, as it is the single most important rule we have.

* Be honest. Honesty is a virtue in this fleet and we expect honesty from all our members. We do not

* The main chat channel

* Politics and Religion are topics that can quickly turn into slugfests, in the general chat we don't want people to be scared away by any debates which some may consider offensive or at the least distracting from STO.

* We do not support hatred

* No begging. Ever. Period. Not in fleet Chat, and it reflects badly on the fleet.

* Generally speaking, we can create an IC channel specifically for roleplaying.

* Be respectful of other players. If other players are being disrespectful to you

* Be mature in your dealing with others. If you have a problem with someone, SOLVE IT. Maturity isn't a measure of age; it is a measure on how you deal with problems, and with conflict. If you do have a problem that you do not believe you can solve on your own, you can contact an officer by whisper, in-game mail or reddit private messaging.

* Your behavior reflects directly on your fleet. Act in a civilized manner at all times. Exceptions can be made if your behavior is In Character in a roleplaying setting - if this is the case though

* Members are welcome to make up events that can be played out in a fleet setting

* Absolutely NO botting, without second chance, and all other major fleets will be warned about you.

**WARNINGS**

When a fleet member does something that goes against our fleet rules and policy, we will give out 3 warnings, followed by removal from the fleet if the offender continues their misconduct:

* First Offense: Warning whispered to the offender. Make a note of it in the officer notes.

* Second Offense: Warning whispered to the offender. Make a note of it in the officer notes.

* Third Offense: Warning made in fleet chat. Also

* Fourth Offense: Offender removed from the fleet with no further warning.

**REMOVAL**

* Kicking members from the fleet is of course not something that we're interested in doing, and how we should deal with each. For anything but the most serious offenses, removing a fleet member will need the approval of 3 officers.

* Too many warnings: See above. If the offender keeps offending

* Playing on a purchased account: Removal from the fleet. We value skilled players willing to put in the effort of leveling from 1-50

* Buying currency (like EC or zen) or leveling services from people and companies not sanctioned by Cryptic: Removal from the fleet - we do not wish to be in any way affiliated with this sort of business practice.

* Serious offenses: Should a fleet member commit what the officers deem a serious offense (threatening someone in real life, they can be removed without warning. This should be reserved for very serious offenses only, and if used, the removing officers should post a detailed explanation of this in the officer forum.",,False,self,1360477832.0,t3_187iw9

- I know a number of you invested in Phased Tetryon Boxes. The exchange got overinflated yesterday with a great number of boxes in the exchange

Tip of the Week - 

- Did you know that there is a consumable item called Deuterium Surplus that can give you a temporary engine and defense boost? Go to the Alhena System of the Eta Eridani Sector Block and contact the Ferengi there to get the ""Defense Contract"" mission. You will have to protect 3 deuterium tanks from True Way forces. If you successfully protect the tanks, you can receive Computer Core Fragments in the mission. 10 will grant you access to the ""Salvage Dispute"" mission at Donatu II. Reward is 1440 dilithium.

Defense Contract is a daily mission while Salvage Dispute is repeatable when you get 10 Computer Core Fragments.

See you online! If you have anything you want added to next week's State of the Fleet

**PART 3: RANKS

---

**RANKS AND PRIVILEGES**

- Benefits as per Ensign
- May access the Fleet bank (expanded access)
- No alts allowed

**Commander:**

*The commander rank is reserved for those of our veterans who have put not only time, a Commander is allowed one alt in the fleet, along with their main character. This is the highest non-officer rank you can attain in Reddit Alert.*

- Benefits as per Lieutenant
- May have 1 (one) alt in the fleet

**Captain:**

*Our first officer rank. Captains are those who have chosen to take on extra duties to help make the fleet a nice place for everyone to play in. The basic captain duties include queuing up Fleet projects, Admirals and Fleet Admirals are all allowed one alt, to help ease fleet management.*

---

**PROMOTIONS**

*We've been working on codifying our promotion process a lot, you will be promoted. However, mistakes will happen, and if you qualify, but have not been promoted yet, it is okay to contact an officer about your promotion. It's likely that you were just overlooked by accident, when an officer last went through the fleet roster for promotions.*

*Lieutenant to Commander requires you to go above and beyond in terms of contributing positively to the fleet, we can't see everything that goes on. If you as a member see someone that you think is deserving of being promoted to commander, we would appreciate it if you send a recommendation by in-game mail to one of our officers. He/she can then pass it on and we can include this in our deliberations.*

**Recruit -&gt; Ensign:**

* Member for 15+ days
* 20k Fleet Contribution

**Ensign -&gt; Lieutenant**

* Member for 90+ days
* 45k Fleet Contribution

* No set time
* Not an automatic promotion

**Captain -&gt; Admiral/Fleet Admiral**

* Done at the discretion of the current Admiralty
* Not an automatic promotion",self,t5_2rfq3,1360776068.0,,Combo,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/187ix5/announcement_ra_fleet_rules_part_3_ranks/
1360441575.0,187ivs,[Announcement] New fleet rules for Reddit Alert - An introduction.,thecipher,39,8,23,"Greetings all.

As most of you know by now, an inactivity policy and so on.

In the interest of full disclosure, should the need arise. There are a few things that will need some special attention here in the transition period to the new rules:

1. **Alts:** We have a new, found under [**Ranks and Privileges**](http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/187ix5/announcement_ra_fleet_rules_part_3_ranks/), only those of Commander rank are allowed an alt, and they only get one. In the interest of helping the fleet run smoother, we have had to allow Officers to have one alt as well, so that we can be more consistent in queuing up projects and such.

1. **Removal of existing alts:** With our new alt policy in place, so that new people can join. Depending on how the new alt policy works out, we might set up a weekly day where you can swap characters in Reddit Alert, but we have no formalized plans for this just yet. For those who do have alts in the fleet and who are not Commander rank, we will give you until **February 12th** to remove them yourself, so that you are left with the character you most want to be in the fleet. On February 12th, we will be going through the roster and removing any surplus alts from the fleet.

1. **A new home for alts:** Our Mirror Reddit fleet is active again

1. **Invite Rights:** Since we now have a proper promotion policy in place, so you should still be able to get an invite when needed.

We hope that these new rules will bring some much-needed clarity and structure to the fleet

Well, rage at trying to find a parking spot at the mall, bring out the Festivus pole, and skate around Q's Winter Wonderland 45 times. That's right, it's Christmas tomorrow!

This year has been amazing for the fleet. We've had some ups and downs but we have prevailed. With STO going F2P and through Season 5, both Snoo and RA, have some of the most advanced Starbases in the fleet and are just speeding through embassy development. Hell, I expect the diplomacy stream for RA to be complete in the next few weeks. 

What matters most is our community. Whether you're in RA, if not, the best community in Star Trek Online. Need an STF? The fleet's there. 20-man? The fleet's there. Help with Q's daily race? The fleet's there. Real life help? The fleet's there. You are all amazing and deserve a pat on the back.

On behalf of the Admirality, drink lots of egg nog (if you like it of course!) and be merry!

All the best

**Tip of the Week** - 

Quick tip for all of you folks running Starbase-related fleet actions.

If you're running a fleet action such as Fleet Alert

Here is a list of [Military Operational Assets](http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/12vcu6/military_fleet_requisitions_and_you_a_guide_to/). They are very handy and can make fleet actions easier

I will be posting guides related to the engineering and science fleet operational assets in the near future.

I feel that we as a community of Star Trek Online players need to work together to confront Perfect World Entertainment and their piss poor customer service.  Continued silence over the matter will only prove to PWE that they can continue the status quo
  
Going back and tallying up the money I've spent on this game, and by proxy, Perfect World Entertainment, roughly $400 of my hard earned money.  Now, depending on your own fandom and zealousness that may seem like a trivial amount of money, to others, it may seem like an enormous amount of money.  

Regardless, and to a larger extent, Perfect World Entertainment, should consider themselves lucky to earn both our passion and our money.  Because let's face it, at this point, as a free-to-play game, we don't have to give Cryptic or PWE one single dime of our cash.  The money we do choose to put into the game should be seen as an affirmation of a product that has thus far exceeded even the wildest dreams of players who at the start those many years back found an uninteresting, and short Star Trek themed MMO. 

As Star Trek Online transitioned from a subscription model to a free-to-play model at the beginning of Season 5, and with that I'm sure a parallel increase in GM tickets being created.  It would seem to me that although the dev team experienced an increase in manpower, the customer service department did not.  

Should we as a community of Star Trek Online players continue to ignore the problem at hand?  Perhaps it is unfair to the devs to consider a boycott of all purchases, or the money stops rolling in.

These are just my thoughts summed up, a petition can be created.

1. Firstly the name of the fleet. There will be three rounds of voting, and a final. I will set up a separate thread where everyone lists their ideas for the name of the fleet. The top fifteen will be put in a new round of voting and the top five will be chosen for a final round. The specifics of each round will be posted later.

2. For this fleet the Fleet Admirals of RA and Snoo will talk to and choose from existing Captains and Admirals of RA/Snoo and other highly motivated people to be the Fleet Admirals of the new Romulan fleet. We will talk to the interested persons and figure out who will make good fleet leaders. However none of these will be existing Fleet Admirals of RA/Snoo with the exception of one

3. The Fleet Admirals of RA/Snoo will be Captains/Admirals in the Rom fleet just to help with projects

4. Aside from the head leadership of the Rom fleet no other officers will be chosen by the Fleet Admirals of RA/Snoo. Rather after that point it is up to the leaders of the Rom fleet to choose their officers and how the fleet will be structured. It will likely be a copy/paste of RA rules with some modifications, etc... is up to them.

5. If another Reddit Romulan fleet is created for whatever reasons that is fine and we welcome their participation on /r/sto

Either Windows 7+ or Dragon NaturallySpeaking (not tested) is required. You may have to start speech recognition the first time by using Windows -&gt; Speech

I wrote this in Python using Dragonfly with SAPI 5.4 backend. The program writes a default configuration file. A number of default arguments are provided in config.txt. The format for all arguments is [here](http://pythonhosted.org/dragonfly/actions.html#key-action)

There are some issues with shifting

This works pretty well for RP

I don't expect this to be particularly useful

Some of the commands I have been able to get working with some consistency are 

    Power to All Shields
    Power to Forward Shields
    Power to Aft Shields
    Power to Starboard Shields
    Power to Port Shields
    (Go To) Full Impulse
    (Go To) Maximum Warp
    Scan the Area
    Scan Anomaly

There are also a few entered that I haven't had chance to test, which would eliminate the need to keep shouting out or spamming spacebar. 

*EDIT* - There seems to be some confusion as to the configuation file. You can add or modify whatever commands you'd like using the config file that appears after you run the program for the first time. The default is [here](http://justpaste.it/2dir). A sample modification is [here](http://justpaste.it/2dis) which shows how to add some of the suggested commands.

1345691072.0,yoc4e,How to ACT (A semi-comprehensive guide),Skookah,32,3,18,"**ACT**

Advanced Combat Tracker, if not the best combat tracker and log parser utility for a wide variety of games, and as we all know, commonly held beliefs are never wrong. It can use a variety of plugins to parse logs, and has a nested options menu that was clearly designed by a programmer as he went along. We love it dearly. Grab it from [here](http://advancedcombattracker.com/download.php).

**The Plugin**

You're going to want to use the latest version of Aria's plugin

Launch ACT, and you should be good to parse - but wait! There's more!

**The Log**

Your first instinct may be to use the Import/Export tab to parse the log, and in the first section (Miscellaneous) you'll see a Log File subsection. Click the Open Log button, browse to your logs folder (for Steam users you'll find it at %steamdir%\steamapps\common\star trek online\Star Trek Online\Live\logs\GameClient) and select your CombatLog. Note that ACT will automatically cull the file as it gets larger, preventing the absurd parse and load times you'd otherwise get.

**The List**

Before we get started, under Output Display in the Options tree. Make sure the big bold setting is checked, ""**Export to Clipboard after combat.**"" Next, tap the Add Preset button, next to the Clipboard Formatting dropdown. You are, of course, welcome to tweak this to your heart's content. Some tips, and ""Prefix Allied statistics"" unchecked. The way I have Per-Combatant Formatting (the useful one) set up is as follows: [{NAME15}: {ENCDPS}   ] (without the brackets,"" make sure your new preset is selected

**The Name**

We're almost ready to get parsing, to the Miscellaneous under Data Correction. You'll find a 'Default character name' text box here. If you're using the latest version of Aria's plugin (and why wouldn't you be), it won't use your character name, it'll use your account @name. This is to make it so you don't have to change things around for all your alts. Put your @name (with the @) in this text box, and hit Apply. Now you can finally head back to the Main tab, where the data will soon be pouring in. Feel free to explore the Options tab further - ACT has dozens of cool and potentially useful options beyond the scope of this guide, and indeed my ability to comprehend.

**The Data**

We're ready to do some combat, or a full blown ESTF if you're feeling randy. Before combat (many people do it before the map change), type '/combatlog 1' into the chat box without quotes. This will enable logging of any combat events that occur within a certain distance of you (if you can see the numbers, it will log them). To quote our own River, ""Whatever the distance, if you can't see gray, the log is gonna have a bad time."" If, you can see ACT while you're in STO

**The Post-Game**

Once you're done combatting things, the first thing you're going to want to do is lord over the rest of your team how high your DPS is. If you set everything up correctly in the ""List"" section, you should be able to just hit Ctrl+V to paste the results directly in to chat. Of course, this will only give you the DPS figures for the last encounter. Sadly, you're going to need to go back into ACT, right click on ""All,"" and hit your preset under ""Export Custom to Clipboard"" to get the right numbers in. I'm working on a way to fix/get around this. Now you can inspect your results thoroughly - and believe me, and not one of the specific Encounters. ACT registers, how long they were involved, by default

**Other Cool Features**

There are really only two features that I both A. find interesting enough to mention and B. know enough about to talk about. The first is simple - in the Main tab, graph, or both. Secondly, if you right click on an Encounter (or All) in the encounter list, you can select 'View Encounter VCR.' This will essentially play back the entire encounter, showing you who did what to whom, and how much, and it groups all same-named entities together as one

Slowly losing control over yourself was really disturbingly well done. Revenge and escape sure felt sweet after that. Also, Memory Lane mission and going back to Virinat... I really liked that place.

**PART 2: OFFICER GUIDELINES**

---

Your position as a fleet officer, not just in terms of the effort you put into helping the fleet along, but also in terms of just being a player. For this reason, we've chosen to write up these general guidelines on how to behave:

* Every officer should be subscribed to /r/racommand and the RAcommand channel in game (ask for an invite). It is where we talk outside the game and any new rules and such discussed

* Any major issues or decisions should be discussed on r/racommand. While it's fine to talk about them on the officer channel in game

* We hold officers to higher standards than enlisted men. As such while it's fine to joke around and mess with people

* Treat people with respect

* Have nigh infinite patience with people. If they don't understand what you're saying

* If someone is harassing you

* Promote use of Fleet facilities.

* Be active on our subreddits (/r/sto, and try to provide as much help as you can there, in terms of well-documented information (preferably with links or somesuch).

* Attend as many events as possible

* Encourage others to attend events as well

* Keep swearing to a minimum

* Occasional swearing is allowed, including TeamSpeak.

* Set an example for others to follow

* While we expect any RA member to set a good example to the rest of the server in how we deal with people, but your fleetmates will also look to you as the example on how to act. Therefore, try to be aware of what you're saying and doing, and how others might understand it.

* If ever there is a problem you're not sure how to deal with

* We highly encourage officers to take the lead in organizing fleet events, and similar. Officers should set the example and encourage our members to talk and generally just enjoy the game.

* The most important rule of all: We want EVERY fleet member to have FUN playing STO. Never forget that ultimately it's a game and the goal is to have fun and just enjoy oneself.",self,t5_2rfq3,False,,Combo,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/187iwq/announcement_ra_fleet_rules_part_2_officer/

So I was doing Cure Space Elite with Reddit Continuum but we were short one, who will wipe out the probes and then the cubes.

He began complaining in the fleet action window that there should be only one Kang defender, without fail.

Our instincts told us to just leave and create a new fleet action, which is a dead giveaway that he was either trolling or had no fucking clue what he was doing because leaving a private fleet action doesn't result in having the STF abandon penalty.

**Chat log:** http://i.imgur.com/nHrS8.jpg

He also complained about our ""incompetence"" in the EliteSTF channel afterwards and I was shocked to read that the other channel members agreed with him

1330541120.0,qbnda,"Message from the ""Leadership"" of REDdit Alert",dscoleri,36,6,19,"I have been keeping quiet through all this drama but I feel at this point it is doing more damage keeping people in the dark and I need to go on the record and clear a few things up.

**On the Past:**

First off everyone knows this mess is really over drama between Zam and the current leadership of Reddit Continuum. Whatever has happened in the past is the past and Zam is no longer in the fleet. 

**On the Current Status of REDdit Alert:**

I took around 6 or 7 months off so many of you may not know me. I was one of the two people that founded this subreddit. I was also one of the original 5 people that created the in game fleet. I was also the one that came up with the name. I thought of the name and then it was voted on. The people of the subreddit chose that name. That is how this fleet was intended to be run from the beginning. This fleet is a democracy not a dictatorship. This is for you guys to have fun. During my absence certain fleet admirals took it upon themselves to rule with an iron fist. Let me be clear

**On the Divide:**

I do believe that this split hurts redditors. I feel that both fleets are weakened and that we are stronger as a whole than split. I just want to go on the record and say REDdit Alert has done everything in its power to reconcile and bring the fleets back together. I personally extended an invitation to the leadership of the Reddit Continuum. My offer was for them to reunify with REDdit Alert and join our command staff. I did not ask them to play a subservient roll but offered shared leadership of the fleet. In fact

**Message to Leadership:**

While I don't agree with them I recognize their right to form a fleet. No mods are to remove any posts or moderate in a biased manner against Reddit Continuum (note: no mods have done this I just want to make this policy clear). They will be given a fair opportunity to grow. If I find that any mod is removing Reddit Continuum posts that mod will be removed from the subreddit. You don't own the subreddit

**In Conclusion:**

If you would like to join the new fleet go right ahead there will be no hard feelings. For anyone that would like to stay I can assure you that you will be pleased with the new leadership. Everyone involved in the drama either stepped down or left for Reddit Continuum. REDdit Alert will be a drama free Fleet from this point on, and have fun, this I promise.

I'm sure some of you know me

In this time I feel I've gained so much out of STO and forged nice friendships with some of you in game. I am in a position now to start to give back to the community

* If you would like to enter the draw, only posts made in this thread will be entered). 

* A RNG (me rolling dice or online RNG) will determine the winner. Deadline for this is month's draw is **SUNDAY THE 31ST OF MARCH**.

* Obviously this is going to work on a fair amount of trust, one entry per person and please actually buy the 1000 Zen with the money you receive - I can't MAKE you do this, I'll just be very disappointed if you don't.

* Should for whatever reason I am unable do the giveaway one month due to personal/unforeseen issues

- RA has unlocked Transwarp Conduit IV. You can use it to transwarp to any of the Cardassian sectors (including Beta Ursae). Transwarp to the starbase and have your ship approach the transwarp conduit to use it.
- Amazing work to both RA and Snoo for their Starbase progress! All that's left is the minor personnel projects and the long grind to Tier V. Keep it up guys!
- There seems to be some confusion over project assignment in RA. The general consensus appears to be to finish Tier V military first. However, please keep an eye on the provisions for the base and throw in various provision projects as required. Thank you!
- The major issue with fleet projects right now appears to be dilithium requirements and, this is an excellent way to acquire 900+ dilithium and 50 flarks every half hour. Team up with 4 other fleet members to get over 4000 dilithium and 250 flarks in a group.

**Tip of the Week** - 

Q's Winter Wonderland is here! Let's talk!

There's lots of stuff to do in Q's Winter Wonderland

When you first arrive at Q's Winter Wonderland, do holiday Epohh missions with the Romulan, trade holiday commodities at the GPL console, trade holiday commodities for holiday items, and access the tailor.

One of the key reasons you're here for though is to acquire the Breen ship! To get it is not an easy task

You should feel honored! [The Great and Powerful Q](http://i.imgur.com/KzqEA.png) has decided to give you a chance to amuse him. 

The PVE race takes you around the map against an NPC opponent. Beware though

Next is the events. Every half hour the Snowman event starts. You and everybody else on the map will be attacked by snowmen. Grab snowballs from the piles around the map (and equip in your equipment!) and destroy the snowmen with the snowballs. You can also, the Snowman Overlord will spawn in the large lake. You must destroy the Overlord (which can also be healed by his Snowman Minions). Once he is destroyed, you will receive some holiday commodities. Fight the Overlord 20 times to get the Snowball Hero accolade/title.

The other event is the PVP race, has a pit that can be difficult to escape. The prizes for this are Winter Epohh tags that can be turned in to research winter-themed Epohhs (6 tags are required to start a winter Epohh doff mission). When you reach the end, make sure you claim your flag as prizes aren't earned automatically! Even if you don't make 1st, 2nd or 3rd, you're rewarded with 2 winter Epohh tags.

There are a number of accolades to earn -

* Snowman About Town - Locate all intractable Snowman scenes in Q's Winter Wonderland. 
* Ice Racer - Run the PVE race 10 times.
* Fast and the Flurrious - Win the PVP race once or compete in the race 20 times.
* Snowball Hero - Fight against the Snowman Overlord 20 times.
* Snowshoe - Crit an Epohh research doff mission.

Extra Tidbits - 

* Snowball piles randomly reward holiday commodities and Epohh tags.
* Snowballs will melt in your inventory after 1 hour.
* Frosted Boots will let you skate and perform stunts on the large lake.
* If you let a tribble consume a winter-themed food item (available from the holiday vendor)
* While Q's Winter Wonderland is active

 * FED vs KDF queues are pathetic due to KDF low numbers.

 * Many KDF missions are just copies of FED missions (Drozana Station Devidian arc

 * It's anti-fun.  It makes things needlessly complicated and annoying.  Remember how annoying it made queueing for STFs?  Not to mention transferring Dilithium between our two Reddit fleets...

 * If you want a reason to say why you can take a Federation guy on that KDF mission where you blow up Utopia Planitia

 * **Let's look at the in-universe reason:** There is no longer ANY point to the FED-KDF war even existing.  In the storyline *from the very beginning* you learn a shadow force ^*cough*Undine*cough* is manipulating the Klingons and Starfleet into war.  Then you find out through the Romulan and Undine arcs that ANOTHER shadow force are manipulating the Undine!
   * Surely the player-character would bring this information back to Starfleet Command / Klingon High Command, the Borg?  You'd think the whole ""STF"" thing would spread to the governments.  It's a common trope in literature to have two forces who realize they are manipulated to band together to fight a common enemy.
      * Unless, see Fed mission *Divide et Impera* and the fact the FED didn't believe Worf when Worf tried to warn them)
         * So why don't FED root them out?  We know what chemicals are needed for Undine to maintain their form.  Unlike Changelings
              * WTF is Section 31 doing about it?
   * There are subplots involving removing war mongers like B'Vat who just want the KDF and FED to fight forever because Survival of the Fittest and all that.  We killed that guy.  Even the KDF thought he was nuts.

I want a sense of movement and progression in the story.  I want to stop seeing ""supply the war effort against the KDF!"" when I'm level 50.  The KDF-FED war is silly.  It should 'end' (environment / NPC dialogue changes) when players progress to Level 50

Diplomatic Immunity and Raiding Party should make it possible to actually DO things in each other's space.

- Stay tuned for next week's State of the Fleet for another big news item related to Subspace Radio and RA/Snoo!

**Money Matters -** 

- Current dilithium price for zen is 158 dilithium for 1 zen
- Prices of Mini-Doff packs have gone up considerably lately (likely due to doff demands on Starbases). Previously acquirable for less than 100k

**Tip of the Week -** 

Did you know we have a Teamspeak server? If you have a mic install the Teamspeak client from [this site.](http://www.teamspeak.com/)

Once you install it

Server password is available in-game from a senior officer or just ask!

Fleet Events -

- Congratulations to REDdit ALERT for achieving Military Rank IV last night! 10 days to the shipyard being available

Money/Business Matters -

- Today's Dilithium/Zen price is 158 Dilithium for 1 Zen
- Key prices have dropped to around 1.35-1.4 million.
- Another reminder to watch your zeroes when you submit something to the exchange. Don't want you guys losing out because of a minor mistake.

Tip of the Week -

This week's tip brought to you by Barbarossa!

Evasive Maneuvers and Engine Batteries are your friends in STFs! With time and big-hitting targets a problem

When you're playing ISE

This is also very helpful when it comes to KASE. If you blitz a gateway (take it down)

As well, and if you're pulling her aggro, you want to get out ASAP.

**PART 5: BANK RULES**

---

**WITHDRAWING**

1. Take what you need

1. Treat the bank like the ""take a penny, but also try to donate your own, good items that you don't need.

1. Don't take items with the intent to sell them or give them away to non-fleet members.

1. The 24 Hour Dump is the exception to the above. You make take anything in there

**DONATING**

1. Only donate rare (blue) and very rare (purple) items to the fleet bank. Exceptions include:

1. Combat support items can go into the Combat Support tab. Overflow goes into the 24 hour dump.

1. The 24 Hour Dump can contain anything that doesn't fit into the other bank tabs

1. In the samples tab

1. No lockboxes in any of the tabs

1. Only rare or very rare tribbles may be donated

**THE REDDIT SHOPPE**

The Shoppe is basically a store, at a highly discounted rate compared to the exchange. The items in the Shoppe are donated by fleet members, and the money earned from sales here will be used towards improving the fleet. This can be buying resources to fill fleet projects if we're stuck on a particular one, for competition prizes and so on. The procedure for using the Reddit Shoppe is as follows:

1. See an item you want. Contact an officer who is online at the time.

1. The officer then checks the price on the exchange.

1. You then donate 50% of the market price (ie. if an item is worth 2 million on the exchange

1. The officer checks the bank log and verifies that the money has been deposited.

1. The officer mails or trades you the item.

That's all there is to it. The prices will change on a day-to-day basis, you're always sure to get a good deal from the Reddit Shoppe. Furthermore, you are also helping out the fleet by basically sponsoring future events and such.",,False,self,t5_2rfq3,,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/187iyh/announcement_ra_fleet_rules_part_5_bank_rules/

Here we go again

Note-Worthy Game Events -

- The 1000 day anniversary of STO is here! [To celebrate, a free starship slot, and a Starfleet Veteran or Empire Veteran title for the forums.
- Until November 12th, there's an added perk: You'll get [every single subscription perk, including the 1000 day ship.](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=706971) Thanks to DMercenary for the correction, even after the sale, you'll still receive the perks, you just pay full price.
- [Just announced
- Season 7 is expected for launch in November
- [Season 7 dev blogs have started!](http://sto.perfectworld.com/blog/?p=709721) A new STF is coming based in Unimatrix 01 called ""Into the Hive"". Only ground photos have been shown.

Fleet Events -

- Another great turn-out at DJ Creamy/Boss' party at the Subspace Radio starbase and DJ Puddytat's ship party. Lots of fun was had!
- As we are very close to Military Tier IV, so we're ahead of the wave with those as the Tier IV military fleets are focusing on military more so than engineering and science.
- Although the Terradome run last Saturday ended in failure
- Snoo's Starbase progress has been running smoothly, the most advanced KDF starbase in the game! Getting close to finishing up Tier IV science.

Money/Business Matters -

- Today's Dilithium/Zen price is 159 Dilithium for 1 Zen
- Key prices are stagnant around 1.5 million ec.
- Markets have been over inundated with Starter Packages in the past few days. Worth 300 Zen, it's good for reselling or giving to a new toon (good low-level gear, an experience boost, 2 boffs and the ""Academy Graduate"" title).

Tip of the Week -

Minor tip

A lot of times, keys, etc. you want to buy in bulk instead of singles. At times, this can be an advantage to you.

Often people will place items in bulk on the exchange for cheaper than what the current price for them is on their own. How do you find these though

If you look at the top left tabs, the cheapest per unit will appear. Thus, if, say there's single batteries for 200 ec, but a bulk of 20 for 2000 ec is on the exchange, that bulk item will appear at the top of the list.

Warning though - Never use the all tab. It is currently ""broken"" and doesn't list all items when you enter search criteria. Make sure you're selecting specific categories when searching for items!

Be on the lookout for opportunities for stacking resistance debuffs with your attacks, for example: [Gravitic Anchor](http://www.stowiki.org/Ability:_Gravitic_Anchor) (3/3 omega bonus) makes a nice improvement to your TPDS for some [really impressive spike dmg](http://i.imgur.com/oAZJg.png).

FAQ:

&gt; Why 2 torps/2 torp consoles?

Unless you're point blank to everything you shoot at (which will get you shot at a lot more than you will like)

&gt;Why disruptors? Whynot X energy weapons?

After looking at my breakdown of [what weapons did what damage](http://i.imgur.com/1y7e0.png)

&gt; But Kit! Isn't (random single target ability) moar dps?

In your one cherry picked example

&gt; Take a look at the boff skill set I'm using currently. It's been doing well for me and there may be things in there that you like as well.

Does it do more than 8k dps? No? Then why would I want to look at it?

&gt; I see you put skill points in ability X

That's great

Now, so bear with me.

***Part One: What To Expect When You're Expecting To Epohh Farm***

First thing's first: you need four Active Epohh Tags. You get those by completing the daily Epohh Collection mission from Toreth in the aptly named Epohh Fields. You get a minute and a half to tag as many Epohhs as you can. I've gotten around 20 on my own

Once you get four Active Epohh Tags, and send them to work.

Twenty four hours later

All told

***Part Two: The ~~Doctor~~ Ambassador Spock Method For Raising Epohhs***

So you have your fistful of Epohh Research's. Go talk to Toreth, Mountain, or Ruins. Doesn't matter which. I like River, because they're blue.

Now, plus Evolved Epohhs. If you Crit an Epohh Raising assignment, your Epohh will Evolve. As far as I can tell, it grants no bonuses other than having a really smart Epohh or something.

Go to the Epohh Researcher appropriate to whichever Epohh you bought.

All Epohhs start as Pups. You want Epohh Elders. To do this, and finally Adult to Elder. You'll need two Science DOFFs with Efficient and/or Eidetic Memory. Start the DOFF mission, go get a beer and a good night's sleep, and come back the next day.

Repeat until you have an Elder Epohh.

***Part Three: Your Empty Epohh Nest***

So you have an Elder Epohh. Nicely done! Time to send him/her/it off to Epohh College or something. Hop on back to Toreth

Select ""400 Romulan Marks""

The best part is

Do you find yourself snoring in KASE? Does CSE take too damn long? Do you just have too much hair on your chest for your own good? Then read on

* KASE

KASE, you already have been doing it for a while. Don't stop burning the gates, just blow up the left one, and rush right to deal with spheres. You can, however, help make things go faster if you play defense. For starters, volunteer to handle left probes if you're capable of high DPS with some survivability, if you are feeling frisky

* ISE

In ISE, if you're doing over 10k, and you've got people in your group more geared to support, help them on their generators before switching back to your own, but don't ever stop shooting at something. When the gens are gone, park yourself so close to the transformer that you're touching it to maximize DPS. After AoE burning all the spheres down, pop an engine battery and evasive maneuvers to rush to the right side

* CSE

For CSE, then shifts middle, doing the same, while taking out middle-spawned raptors. AoE is king here. When a top probe pops and a Negh'var spawns, focus your attacks on it, because you do NOT want an isometric charge ruining your group. You should easily be able to finish with almost 10 minutes left on the clock.


*****DISCLAIMER*****

These all require a few people in the group to have above-average DPS. If you're all pulling 3k (5k for an escort is just as easy as 3k for others)

Just did a successful run of the new Vault fleet action. Figured I'll give you guys a heads-up so you know what to expect.

- The Fleet Action is only available during specific hours
- The Vault consists of 3 sections - Main entrance
- At first
- Obisek's ship (a Bird of Prey) can be healed once in the game by an action button. Use this wisely.

- In the first room
- Once you clear the room

- The second room will have 4 cores and have constantly respawning Birds of Prey. Ensure you have adequate protection for Obisek. Twice, 2nd time we had about 10 seconds to spare). You must destroy all enemy resistance by the countdown.

- Third room is the theleron generator. Make sure Obisek is protected. The room has everything from Scorpion fighters

- Obisek will need your help with 1 thing in the third room, it's protecting him and destroying the D'Deridex. Again, this is timed. Once the D'Deridex is destroyed and Obisek is done disabling the generator, the mission ends and you get a Reman Datalog. 

- The Reman Datalog can be used in doff missions available from the tactical department on your ship.

EDIT - Reman Datalogs are used to build the new Prototype Reman set which consists of, deflector and engine. The shield is acquired from the regular Romulan mission.

- It's like a chain to make a better set. You first have to build the rare Mk XI pieces with your tactical officer. Then you give a piece to your engineer to build the rare MK XII pieces. Then you give it to your science officer to build the very rare Mk XII pieces. Rare Mk XII costs 10 datalogs,,False,self,t5_2rfq3,True,,True

The smaller fleets on the other hand grow very slowly.  New members are added sparingly and only when members know and like someone.  There's no need for votes on things

However, and frustrations mount.  It becomes impossible to teach so many people at the same time, and only serves to create more of a divide.  

Truth be told, you can be part of some of the most involved players in the game with the aspects that interest you.  Here's a list of some of the best:



**EliteSTF**  -  Filled with players who run elite stf's and know how to run them well.  They do every one with a strategy

**Accolades**  -  For players who like to grind titles and accolades

**Dorado**  -  For new players who need help with missions

**STORP**  -  For players who like to roleplay

**OrganizedPvP**  -  For PvP players who are sick of losing in PuG's.  

**RedditChat**  -  Allows you to be part of the Reddit community in STO without feeling like you have to be friends with everyone who browses the site.  The best part of Reddit is that you don't have to agree with everyone or be best buddies with everyone.  You can speak your mind



I myself am in a small fleet of people who all get along, I know where other RP'ers are and where to find them.  I PvP often with the help of OrganizedPvP and win most all the games we play, or lose games that are truly epic and not just because I'm stuck with baddies.  I make conversation in RedditChat and feel connected to this site, but am miles away from the drama that comes with the diversity of mind that reddit brings.

The Mirror Reddit fleet will be re-tooled into a Romulan Themed fleet, but to also lend some structure the the whole fleet experience:



* **NAME:**

* The Mirror Reddit fleet will be renamed to something more appropriately Romulan-y. We will resume the name voting that was started a while ago

.



* **RULES:**

* The re-tooled Mirror Reddit fleet will use the current Reddit Alert rules in full, but simplicity and ease of administration are the main ones. Think of this Romulan themed fleet as a branch of Reddit Alert, rather than a separate entity.

.

* **LEADERSHIP:**

* Keeping administration of the Romulan fleet manageable was our main concern, we will use the current one. This will cut down on the overall administration needed to run both fleets, as they will be treated as one entity by the officer group.

.

* **RANKS:**

* The ranks for Mirror Reddit will be re-done, this might seem a bit harsh, but our reasoning for this is because we want the ranks, and therefore the characters, to be completely transferable between the two fleet. If you're an ensign in Mirror Reddit, then you're an ensign in Reddit Alert, and vice versa

* The rank names in the Romulan themed fleet will likely be renamed to something more appropriate

.


Our main reasoning for these decisions is one of simplicity. We already have all this stuff in place, and our members will know what to expect, both of the fleet, but also of the leadership of said fleet.

* **Q:** **What will happen to the alts I have in Mirror Reddit currently?**
* **A:** Nothing, and likely have to make a third fleet for alts. With over 300 open spots in Mirror Reddit currently though, this is not an immediate concern.

* **Q:** **Can I still get new alts invited into the Mirror fleet?**
* **A:** Yes, and you can have as many alts in Mirror Reddit as you'd like.

* **Q:** **Will the re-tooled fleet be for Romulans only?**
* **A:** No

* **Q:** **I signed up to be an officer in that thread on r/sto. Are you going to make me one?**
* **A:** If deemed necessary, you do so for both fleets, and that we expect a high level of activity and dedication to the fleet. As of the time of writing this, we are not planning on adding any further officers, but we are constantly keeping an eye on how things are going, and whether we need more people for officer work or not.",ANNOUNCEMENT,self,Combo,

1375222031.0,1jdo1z,STO Review. My perspective after 1.5 years.,,45,20,68,"The main appeal of STO (to me) is the obvious one

Total Biscuit has a term that he uses for this type of gaming, and are willing to overlook some of it's faults because of it. Admittedly, at first, things seemed pretty swell. The campaign was quick and relatively painless, the progression was satisfying, and the game seemed to offer a good variety of Star Trek like gameplay with an obvious emphasis on combat. By the time I leveled to 50 I was having a good time, and I quickly went back to create other characters of different classes to try out different aspects of the game. Soon, and eventually PVP. I won a Jem'Hadar attack ship and worked tirelessly to outfit it with all the ridiculously priced purple consoles it could handle. I ground through the reputation systems and the ""adventure zones"". And after all that

I've recently taken stock of how much money I have spent on Star Trek Online and realized that for that amount I could have tripled my Steam library. Now, typically more than on any other game ever, and certainly far more than it deserves. Why does it not deserve this? Because it's flat out not a very good game.

The best example of this has to be PVP. I spent an incredible amount of time and money building my attack ship up so that it could compete in PVP, so you spend half of every match spinning in a circle (corkscrew) because you can't go straight up or down and the maps are broken and everyone always hides at the top. With some few exceptions where two high level ""pre-made"" groups are going at it or where a pug group just comes together, there's very little to the tactics of it either. You all concentrate fire on one target, cycle through your abilities as fast as you can over and over again until they blow up, then do it again. And again.

The worst thing about STO is the obvious cynicism behind it. Other companies might produce more content for you to explore with your characters

This cynicism also conflicts with the whole Star Trek theme park experience. Want to fly a proper Federation ship? Go ahead, it bugs me that I essentially have to fly my Jem'Hadar attack ship or the Andorian escort because all the Federation escorts are dramatically inferior. Cruisers, which have been mostly the focus of Star Trek, are essentially useless, although at least they are durable.

I wouldn't resent STO so much if it hadn't asked for so much. But it demanded that I spend all this time leveling up it's systems and endlessly repeating the repeatable missions. It demanded that I log in everyday to flip over ""reputation projects"" that are as exciting as filling out a work order and to ensure that my fleet doesn't kick me out for being inactive. It required that I spend money to reallocate my skill points even though they have already made more money off me than any game ever has. Every single console on my ship is a considerable ""investment"" of time and / or money

Last, basic things like tool tips don't even work. Red Alerts haven't worked since I started playing a year and half ago. Even the login screen bugs out every second time. Some of my characters eye color is bound to parts of their uniform, and so on and so on.

Part of this is that I have realized I do not want to play MMO's at all anymore. I don't want to commit the time. I don't want to feel that I ""have"" to log in everyday. Gaming shouldn't be a chore or an obligation. It's supposed be recreational. I shouldn't have to spend hundreds of hours grinding in order to play a decent competitive match. If fact

So, unethical business practices and a sloppy technical foundation. If you were considering trying STO out I would strongly encourage you not to bother, in the same way I would discourage you from giving money to a pyramid scheme. Some of you, no doubt, really enjoy STO and I don't begrudge you for that. But, if quality in games is important to you, if you want to be able to expect more from the games you play, which produce a crappy product whose only purpose is to suck from the teet of the franchise

It has three sections which take place on an Undine  replica of DS9. You first wipe out a bunch of Undine. We had no problems there.

1) We need to formally select a name

2) While we're at it with the name

3) Probably the most important thing here, but I think it’s smart to select at least more than one.  Here are some ways we could go about this:

a) People carry over their rank from either REDdit Alert or House of Snoo (ex. if you’re say

b) We could set up some sort of poll/election to decide the leadership.  If we choose this option

c) We could just let whoever wants to be an officer

d) We could let the officers of RA and Snoo decide internally.

I’m not attempting to endorse any one of these options

&gt;The wtex files are the native texture format used in STO they pose no thread at all. The zips contains wtex and txt files
The wtex-es work the following way:
There is a Localdata folder inside your Star Trek Online\Live folder. That localdata is an active directory. Which means
The replacement file have to have the same filename and the same folder location as the original file. Use a different name or different location and the file will not be loaded for replacement.
Also the replacement file has to have the same file type. You won’t be able to load up a JPG even if you rename it to wtex.

&gt;You need to extract the content of the texture zips into your Star Trek Online\Live\Localdata folder

&gt;To remove the mod all you need to do is to remove the files, but since there are more mods, if you delete the entire Texture_Library folder, you practically remove every mod.


&gt;These mods DO NOT change or modify any core files. So you don’t have to keep a secondary copy of the game files. If you want to remove every mod and go back to vanilla STO you need to delete everything from your Star Trek Online\Live\Localdata folder.

&gt;These mods are CLIENT SIDE ONLY! This means

&gt;Now about patching. The files in the localdata folder have the precedence over the data in the hoggs. That is the reason patching should not be a problem. However
- If a patch changes a file that you mod in your localdata, if the devs replaced the mouse cursor today, I would not notice that at all, since my modded cursor is loaded by default. I would only see the patched cursor after I removed the modded cursor.
- If a patches changes the name or the location of a file

&gt;When you add a new mod

&gt;The client checks all the mod files when you launch the game. This means they will not cause crash during game. If a file is bad in any way

1369801390.0,1f900s,Addressing the REDdit ALERT Fleet Capacity Issue,FoxtrotBeta6,21,0,40,"Greetings everybody

Today, our memberbase has been so active that we won't have anybody falling under the inactive period for around a week, and that is if they do remain inactive for this week.

So this leaves us with an issue of capacity. We had a similar issue with S7 came out but overtime

In the meantime

1) As Reddit Star Empire and RA share ranks, the officers, place a join date as a note when you join so you won't be reset for time when you are eligible to rank up. We can also make a note about your contributions to RSE to transfer to RA.

2) I am instigating a temporary ban on adding alts into the fleet for Commanders and officers until such a time that the fleet capacity issue simmers down. Feel free to add your alt/s to RSE in the meantime.

We, unfortunately, a 500 fleet member limit really limits us. We are currently one of the largest, if not the largest, of all communities in STO, and we only want to be the best for all of you. Alas, when a spot comes up and you have a toon in RSE than you originally wanted in RA

Thank you very much for your understanding!

It occurred to me that there's some confusion about how it works (not to mention I wanted to know the details myself)

[*For an aux2 batt setup to work correctly, or ATB) innate passive ability, which allow a single bridge officer's skill to cool down as if there were two copies. I equipped these three technician doffs for this experiment. I should also note the second of aux2batt's benefits is the power boost it gives to weapons, shields, and engines when activated. This power boost is what the experiment was designed to track.*]

So...for simplicity's sake, and EPTS1. It's probably the most commonly used setup and is also quite useful, I've found. I reset my power settings to 50/50/50/50, which in my ship is actually 63/71/71/63. 

The raw data is below. 

| time of skill activation | W/S/E/A power level| skill activated|  power boost given to W/S/E/A |
| ------------- |-------------|-------------|-------------|
|--:--|63/71/71/63 (baseline)		|	|
|00:00|63/71/71/82 |EPTA1	|---/---/---/+20|

|00:32|63/90/71/82 |EPTA1	|---/---/---/+20|
|00:33|70/98/79/63|ATB1	||

As you can see, and engines (descrip says +22.1 for 10 seconds). For some reason EPTS1 gives a boost of +27 to shields (descrip says +19 for 30 sec). Even after power was flushed from auxiliary to everything else (i.e. - battery, not to be confused with ship devices), auxiliary power levels gradually recovered after a while and increased to the level set by EPTA1. 

What's interesting is that the second ATB1 didn't boost anything at all. This is due to the fact that there is virtually no power in auxiliary to send to the other three power reserves. At first glance of the chart

So what does this all mean? You can get a nice power boost to W/S/E by using auxiliary to battery, W/S/E power will drop back to their baseline settings. However, don't think this means you don't need to chain aux2batt, because it still needs to be activated constantly for skill cooldown reduction. 

This fluctuation between ATBs will be less evident in most ships

Well

**TL;DR** aux2batt will really bring out the blue in your eyes.

So I was looking at stowiki a bit and noticed that there are three dual type beam arrays which all have the disruptor modifier

* [Spiral Wave Disruptor](http://www.stowiki.org/Spiral_Wave_Disruptor)

* [Plasma-Disruptor Hybrid Beam Array](http://www.stowiki.org/Plasma-Disruptor_Hybrid_Beam_Array)

* [Polarized Disruptor Beam Array](http://www.stowiki.org/Polarized_Disruptor_Beam_Array)

All three of these get the bonus from the [Disruptor Induction Coil	](http://www.stowiki.org/Console_-_Tactical_-_Disruptor_Induction_Coil) allowing for minimal to no DPS loss. In theory I could be procing on each broadside salvo:

* 2.5% chance to cause -10% Damage Resistance for 15 seconds
* 2.5% chance to lower the target's power levels by 25 for 5 seconds.
* 2.5% Chance: 171 Plasma Damage
* 2.5% Chance: Disable 1 Subsystem for 5 sec

So on my cruiser my current set up is:

What I'm not completely sure about is whether or not by doing this I would be just weakening the procs overall so having three meh ones as opposed to one great proc. In theory you could get the Polarized Distruptor with 2x [Acc], so not as great as the other two but not bad. Part of my thinking is that as a Tank there's no way in hell I'm ever going to be DPS champ, but if I can proc several different things on my target (or several targets with FAW) I can aid the team even more than just soaking up damage like a sponge.

Personally I think this would be a terrifically fun build that's a little bit different than just one type of beam array. With this set up you've got four different color beams coming out

Edit: Also from what I've seen from basic research is that you can only proc on a target one of each type (such as if you've proc'd to disable the subsystem

Edit 2: Also looking at the various weapon modifiers:

* CrtD: +20 Critical Severity
* CrtH: +2% Critical Chance
* Acc: +10% Accuracy
* Dmg: +X Damage

Yes by using hybrid weapons I'm losing another one of these modifers. But this goes back to being a tank. More crit severity or chance or damage isn't going to make that much difference, so it deals a bit less damage and only has +7.5% Accuracy compared to the others, hence why I'd only run one of them.",,False,self,t5_2rfq3,,http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/19uyx0/a_good_rainbow_cruiser_or_a_study_in_abusing_dual/

2. Once you have the Epohh Tags go to the Researcher where Q is. 

3. Start the Doff mission""Research Tagged Epohh"" (the Winter version and the one in New Romulan is different and are separate missions). Try to increase the crit chances so you get one with a Bow or Earmuffs and hopefully an adult epohh.

4. Once you run the above mission continue raising it until it's a Elder.

5. Once you have an Elder (hopefully one with a Bow or Earmuffs) go to the GPL Conversion Unit -&gt; Store -&gt; Winter Epohh Trade In. 

6. Exchange the Elder epohh for 100 or 200 Romulan Marks. The epohh with a bow or a Earmuffs get 200. 

This is a very easy way to make enough Rom Marks without having to grind them via PvE missions. 

I just finished Tier III just by getting the Rom Marks from the Winter event. I also got the Zero Point console (500 Marks). Currently have 1300 marks to spend. 


edit:

Note: Also do the same thing with the Epohh mission in New Romulan. I believe the Elders there give 400 Rom Marks. Not in STO right now so can't check.

After running an almost perfect Starbase Fleet Defense fleet action just now

This is a new fleet action (20 people) involving the defense of your starbase against hordes of attacking fleets (similar to the 5 man starbase defense mission

This works best with full teams. Make sure you communicate via the team chat and RedditChat over who's doing what. You need to work together as a team to defend the starbase and outposts. 

- Before the match begins, South or West. These are the areas each team must protect. Because the first freighters have names such as ""Alpha Group"" assign those as well to prevent direction confusion.
- The first objective is to protect freighters as they go toward the perimeter (there's one group for all north, west, hence why you need teams assigned). Once you approach the outposts on the perimeters, enemy forces warp in (2 waves) that you must defeat. Give the freighters tactical teams to help their protection against the enemy forces.
- Once all enemy forces are dealt with
- Alongside defeating the forces, Tactical team, Engineering team, etc.) is extremely helpful. Always keep an eye on the starbase even when on the attack to make sure the base remains intact.
- Once these hordes are defeated, etc.) and defeat the hordes and  prevent sabotage. The less damage the outposts sustain, the more fleet marks you get.
- Final wave requires you to return to the Starbase where flagships will warp in with escorts. Defeat the flagships in your specific compass direction (4 groups beam in, etc.).

That completes the fleet action. Your progress determines your fleet marks.

Team work and communication is key in this. Make sure you know where you have to go and you will do well!

So I'm gonna break down how i got my D'kora for $50 and a few days of work.

**Step 1**

* Buy $50 of Cryptic Points
* Dont buy keys with these points.

**Step 2**

* Exchange your ~4200 Cpoints for dilithium. I've found the best time do exchange your dilithium for Cpoints is around 9 PM PST. This is when the most people are playing the game

* Do the Math. Say you converted 4200 Dilithium for 310 Dilithium per point. That gives you 1

**Step 3**

* Buy Uncommon Unreplicatable Materials from the vendor at Memory Alpha (they can be bought in stacks of 100.) They cost 1, or buying off the exchange, so yes, they are rare.

* Do the Math,000 Dilithium. Divide that By 1000 (cost of each unreplicatable material). Your able to buy 1302 Uncommon Unreplictable Materials. 

**Step 4**

* Sell Uncommon Materials on exchange. You need to get at least 65K Each. These Mats sell for 70K most of the time,999K. Other players who play the economy will buy them up almost instantly
* Selling them in singles is how i sold most of mine. They sold really fast. I would list 35 singles
* Use a alternate character to list even more, they will sell overnight.

* Do the math,630,000. Almost enough to buy the D'kora.

**Last Step**
* Sell any Powered alien artifacts you get over the time your selling the mats

**Final Notes**

* The best time to find a cheap D'kora is 9pm PST.
* This is a guarenteed way to get the ship, and having no Guarantee. 

* You could also speed up the process by selling rare and very rare doff's off of alts if you wanted to. I didnt have to do that

* Protip: on exchange, except instead of hitting submit, click your mouse on a blank spot of your screen. This will automatically put comma's in your pricing field, and it will also auto remember your auction price, so you dont have to enter it over and over again.

Hope this helps some of you :)

Before you spam me with questions I will try to answer some of the more important ones below.

-----

&gt; Why are you leaving?

I don't really play STO anymore, etc.). My last logons to STO consisted mainly of roster checks, chat lurking, and other administrative stuff. I think that a FA who actually plays often and is passionate about the game like I was should take my place.

&gt; What happens to us?

I think that there are many capable hands in the fleet who will step up and take leadership, and it took the help and dedication of many players, myself included, to make r/sto into a subreddit where everyone is welcome. Hopefully [the posting rules](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/sto#PostingRules) will keep it that way. Even if you aren't in either of the Reddit fleets, everyone who creates meaningful discussion is a valuable part of this subreddit; it's what makes small subreddits like r/sto good and draws more subscribers. Never forget that.

&gt; What happens to you?

I'm graduating university as an engineer (fuck yeah engineers) at the end of this year so I'll be busy starting life and all that business. As for games, and it's also frequented by the developers (yay John Smedley). I know that some of you will probably be interested in playing with me. Currently it's in beta so you will need to grab a beta key in order to play (they're being handed out everyday... look around).

I will remain moderator of r/sto for the time being since it's still growing

1342457596.0,wnfyz,Nukara Ground Invasion - Exterior - A Guide,FoxtrotBeta6,21,2,9,"Hey folks!

After playing on Nukara for a few hours straight last night, provides some amazing drops and is great to run with in a crowd! I figured a guide would be great for this new ground invasion to help you guys out. This guide covers the exterior missions, and not the interior ones.

Similar to Defera Ground Invasion, Hard and Zone-Wide. Each difficulty level has it's own transport area (Base Camp Alpha [easy], Beta [medium] and Charlie [hard]). Indeed, these are a hell of a lot easier with a full group of people, a requirement for hard, but you can do the medium missions alone.

The main drop for each mission is a Tholian Equipment Pack (basic for easy, they're like lockboxes in that you can still get the good gear (the Tholian ground set) even from advanced boxes. The boxes also drop EVAs (with ground buffs) and anti-Tholian weapons (very rare Mk XIIs are amazing!). 

First runs of each mission reward fleet marks (5 for easy, easy and medium don't have a cooldown but don't reward fleet marks for around 20 hours after you complete the first run. You still get the requisition pack reward though.

Let's get started.

-**Easy** - 

- Industrial Espionage - With each Tholian spawn point you'll see a little machine generating a rift. Clear the Tholian or two from the area and shut down the machine. Destroy 15 and you complete the mission.

- Scientific Espionage - This mission is great to run even if you're running the medium missions, they have a chance of dropping a blue science report. Collect 30 blue science reports to complete the mission. If you go on a mad killing spree, especially in the medium zone, you can complete this very quickly.

-**Medium** - 

- Rescuing Redshirts - In the medium zone, and you get credit for the rescue (this works faster in a team). This mission is very easy to finish in a few minutes if you focus SOLELY on the crewmen and ignore the Tholians, especially if you're in a team. I personally solo'd this mission in 3-5 minutes, so it's great to farm for advanced boxes. Save 15 redshirts and you can turn in it.

- Closing Doors - Before you can start this, this is a lot easier if you're on a team. Sometimes you'll get a messaging saying that the ""code is invalid"", so just keep trying until it works. After you shut down the rift, either a Tholian Lieutenant will spawn or a fellow crewman (their rescue will count for Rescuing Redshirts and they may give you more Tholian codes). Shut down 15 rifts to turn it in.

-**Hard**

-Transdimensional Tactics - 

This one is a doozy and requires 5 people. You'll need to enter a cave near the transport point of Base Camp Charlie. Once in there

For this mission

When you activate the console on the platform, which will also start covering more of the ground, so be careful!). Stay on the platform and use snipers to take down the lieutenants and rifts. If required, tread carefully off the platform to get the rifts farther away.

After the rifts are destroyed, the platform is your friend now) and Tholian Trappers will spawn from the rifts. Have engineers utilize cover shields and/or wedge yourself between the Tholian consoles on the platform. These trappers will grab you with webs and try to pull you into the liquid. Kill the trappers to prevent getting pulled in.

After these trappers and rifts are destroyed

Once the leader is killed and the rest of the trappers dealt with

I hope this helps you all!

It isn’t fair to claim, which is in turn purchased with actual money.  Fleet credits are often earned with dilithium for many players, which means that they too are connected to real money.  I do not appreciate the squandering of these resources.

Under the January 17th 2013 patch notes, this change was not included in the patch notes.  I do not appreciate misinformation.

I understand that the development team must work to balance the game.  However, to acquire.  Changes of this nature have happened before, and it's time that they stopped occurring.  If this trait is not to be changed back, I think I speak for those affected by this change that we would appreciate a refund of the cost of these extra Romulan bridge officers, or at least some form of recompense.

I know that the game developers sometimes browse this page, hopefully at the very least they will not do things like this again.

Other Stuffs -

- In other news, a bug has been discovered where KDF can enter ESD and have been moving various personnel around. You'll likely be seeing security personnel with weapons out and misplaced personnel. Either search around or switch to another instance.
- This week's Spotlight on the Foundry is [Keeping up with the J'Sens](http://sto.perfectworld.com/news/?p=705501)

- Key prices are stagnant around 1.4-1.5 million ec.
- Cheap mini-doff packs are appearing a lot more often now due to the overinflation of the packs available. At 4 doffs per pack

Tip of the Week -

- Efficient Saurian/Lethean officers

Unlike other boffs, come with an extra space trait called ""efficient"".

They sell for a lot of money on the exchange

Efficiency basically improves your power management when power levels are set low on various systems. For instance

This is extremely useful

See you online! If you have anything you want added to next week's State of the Fleet

After you complete each of the 14 Colonization chains

Cryptic, which lets you turn an Uncommon/Rare/Very Rare duty officer into three of the next lowest category of duty officer. So, a Very Rare becomes three Rares.

Along with that, *Fabricate Prototype Console from Alien Artifact*, needs five Engineers with Resolve for Success, with Crits on Efficient, Stubborn, and Cunning.

There is a Tellarite Personnel Officer at Starfleet Academy, an Engineering specialization, or both.

Tellarites with Stubborn and Resolve fetch around a million EC on the Exchange. Tellarite Engineers with Stubborn and Resolve fetch 20 million plus. Very Rare Mk XII Consoles net between 3 and 50 million EC

So

The only caveat is because the Grind to Craft ratio is 3:5, but those can always hang around until you have other Rares to combine them with.

Do you see where I'm going with this?

TL;DR - it's possible to ""farm"" the Support Very Rare DOFFs, and get a Very Rare DOFF that's worth between one and twenty million plus EC with the right traits on the Exchange, or assemble a team of those DOFFs to craft Mk XII consoles and either keep them, sell them, or give them away.",,False,t5_2rfq3,True

I decided to take some action seeing as how no one really did anything. I browsed the fleet roster and removed anyone who has been inactive for 45 days or more to make room for players who are active.

If you got booted and are reading this, you will be invited again, no questions asked.

A total of 64 people were removed from the roster, seeing as how Reddit Alert has passed its exponential growth phase (I hope). However, we can still expect to gain new members since STO itself is still actively being developed.

**Summary:**

* Members of Reddit Alert who have been inactive for 45 days from today (25 March 2012) have been removed from the roster to make room for active players. 64 people were removed due to inactivity

* If you have been removed from the fleet and wish to return

I want everyone's input on this. I know I took initiative without informing the other officers, again, any input is appreciated.

-----------------------------
NEW INFO (UNCONFIRMED)

The ""Territory Control"" is a **GROUND COMBAT** mechanic.

The Dyson Sphere Zone is the size of a **3x3 SECTOR SPACE GRID** and there are **THREE DYSON SPHERES.**

Rep system is changing for the voth one. No normal rep system you get loot when doing stuff and can be mkxii stuff.

The new zone is not one zone

There will also be battle zones in which PCs will enter in groups of 20 plus boffs (I missed this part but it was pretty clear boffs will be limited). The battlezones will be territory control where the players battle the Voth for control of the sphere, if everyone leaves the Voth will eventually take it back.

It sounded like there will be multiple zones on the surface of the dyson sphere

The sphere somehow ties into the Iconian storyline, but if you haven't finish it.

Swenid, we are picking up unusual readings from the Hfihar System. The Federation database matches them to Species M-113."" says Swenid. ""Salt Vampires! Beam me down at once!"", demands the Captain. ""Captain, we are still 7.4 lightyears away and Starfleet Regulations clearly..."" ""To hell with the regulations! Maximum Warp!""*  
  
  ~~~  
    
**0. Introduction - Check out the corpse on the street
  The map is divided into 4 districts: Mining, to get the mision started, is to investigate the body (marked on the minimap). Just approach it and a regular interaction option appears. A message appears and the timer for Act 1 starts.  
    
**1. Curfew**  
Each district has 32 Romulan Civilians who are in need of saving. The team now has to approach every civilian to tell them to go home. Remember, but don't run away too far from your assigned district, ever!  
The catch is that some of the civilians are actually representatives of Species M-113 -  they show their true hideous face after telling them to go home. Shoot them all. In fact shoot whenever you see one immediately
Salt Vampires also have the ability to confuse you. A confusion which either designates you a target to your allies, STOP SHOOTING and be extra careful with powerful abilities like Orbital Strike.  
However
  
  **2. Fortify the buildings**  
  Each district has 4 buildings, run to a building and fortify it (regular interaction option). Notice the health bar for every building. Protip: you can have fortification materials in your inventory even after this phase, which means you can basically repair a building in the next phase. Usually though this is not the case - it is more important to fortify the buildings to full health in this phase.  
  Market building 4 is bugged, don't bother with building 4. Take extra care of it in the next phase though.  
    
**3. Protect the buildings**  
Each team member announces which building they are going to protect. The fifth team member floats. Focus on the 'Subterranean Entrances' from which the Salt Vampires come crawling. If an Alpha spawns (a captain level Salt Vampire), turrets, redshirts, tricorder scans - all very useful. But don't use damage dealing abilities that can kill civilians. If you do this I will personally visit and slap you.  
  
  **4. Escort the civilians**  
  After the buildings have been successfully protected (or not) the civilians must be escorted to a shuttle rendezvous point. Each district has its own rendezvous point and path to it. When in doubt where to go, you can actually resuscitate them.  
    
**5. Protect the civilians**  
Once everyone has reached the shuttle rendezvous point
After everything is said and done
  
  
**Hear this:**  
  - Read team chat  
  - Stay inside your district  
  - Focus on Subterranean Entrances and Alphas (call them out)  
  - Don't kill the civilians  
  - Resuscitate civilians who died  
  - Make use of your abilities, Orbital Strike, Security Team, Lunge, etc.  
  - Stop shooting if the Salt Vampires confuse you!  
  - Help your team mates  
  - Be a good sport  
  
 I probably forgot a whole bunch of things
Good Luck!

Mine is the Heavy Escort Carrier. After buying it a couple months ago, it can load dual cannons (which I am a huge fan of), and has a great array of Tac-heavy stuff that tunes very nicely to me. It's also a beast of a ship that feels very tanky at times (for being an escort of course). Also the fighters come in very handy for a bit of extra DPS, or to ward off little crap you can never see. And torpedos (I'm loving the torpedo point defence and the photon torpedo launcher (with high-yield) combo. It's like throwing buckets of water at enemies, except it's torpedos rather than water)

That is:

* In Front of Admiral Quinn's Office on Earth Space Dock.
* In Front of The Council House in First City.

You will be then prompted to start the mission called 'Temporal Ambassador'.

You **DO NOT** Start it from Q. Q's thing is a different

You will get **BOTH** A Tier 3 (Normal) and Tier 5 (Retrofit) version of the ship for doing the mission **DURING THE EVENT**.

Just seemed to be a lot of confusion about that going around in general.
 
 
 


SOME Other Tidbits are as follows

* Event Runs Jan 31st-Feb 14th
* Federation Characters **Level 6 and UP** can start Temporal Ambassador. Klingon Characters **Level 22 and UP** can Start Temporal Ambassador.
* Your Class/Career has nothing to do with if you get the ship or not.
* It is unknown if the Tier 3 version of the Ambassador and Kamarag will be available after the event
* Q's Prizes are: Anniversary Gift Box Containing a Random Item
* Q is in Club 47 on ESD

* Tip: Party Poppers seem to be the one you'd want to be mainly farming. From below: 

&gt; Look up the prices of old poppers on the exchange. 2nd Anniversary popper goes for around 1.6 Mil and the 1st Anniversary popper goes for 8 Mil. The event is only 2 weeks and getting them is harder this year the in the past. Skip the lame prizes and 500 Dil and farm poppers.

I came to this conclusion because Star trek doesn't feel like a cohesive game yet. Star Trek has many fun but separate elements however,pvp,Fleet missions,starfleet academy,)

I do see a cohesive game developing with the incorporation of Commendation Xp into more aspects of the game.  Cxp now converts to Fleet Marks which incorporates the fleet starbase. Well done on that plan.

I must say 

I love the fact that the exploration missions are random however my criticism is that they are not in context, linear, with no permanence, development or story progression. 

Using Cxp to roll play a colony ship 

Foundry is of course a great outlet 

The person I talked to who I think is having the most fun playing this game is a guy who plays real life star trek RPG with friends

Let's have a discussion about how to farm dilithium quickly and efficiently. Here are a couple of my personal tips and tricks that I use:

* Since I don't play every day, so it's possible to accept a daily, wait 20 h, then complete the same daily twice in a row for double the rewards.

* Join the REDALERT channel for real-time Borg alerts. If you are Level 50 and have decent equipment

* The ""Investigate Officer Reports"" daily rewards **1440 D** each time it is completed. Quick foundry missions are made by The_Grand_Nagus. For Federation

* Combine ""Explore Strange New Worlds"" with an exploration mission. If you are Level 50

* The security officer on ESD/Qo'nos/DS9 lets you turn in ~~3x~~ 5x Contraband for an easy **2000 D**. If you have Contraband or spare energy credits to purchase them on the exchange

* Elite STFs reward **960 D** each time and take about half an hour each to complete. You also get Borg Neural Processors

* Starfleet Academy and KDF Academy have a midterm daily which you can use to quickly grab **480 D**. This takes less than a minute and you can guarantee your success by using [this page](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhYCXe6RfDINdFk0WTBXYzNxU2ZzNGV5UEw2aGdQbmc#gid=61) (Interactive Path to 2409).

**How to find the assignment**

The assignment you want is called Experimental Warp Core Upgrades (or if you're a Romulan

It's an engineering assignment that can be found (rarely) in sector space

*Some info about how department head assignments work:*

* Each sector block (Sirius, NOT the sectors inside a sector block such as Bajor/Cardassia/Kalandra inside BU) will have its own set of department head assignments.  
* Department head assignments are unique to you. Other people are NOT guaranteed to see the same department head assignments in the same sector.  
* Department head assignments CAN be shared by inviting people to your bridge and having them talk to the DOff contacts on your ship.  
* Department head assignments reset every 20h

If someone says they got the assignment somewhere

**TL;DR**: fly to every sector checking your engineering department head until you find it. If someone says ""I found it here

**How to do the assignment**

The warp core version of the assignment require 2x Matter-Antimatter Specialists and 2x Science. Matter-Antimatter Specialist is the success trait for all 4 slots (which is likely a bug since M-A Specialists are in Engineering, and Teamwork are the critical success traits.

The Romulan-only singularity version requires 2x Gravimetric Scientists and 2x Science. Gravimetric Scientist is the success trait for all 4 slots and Cunning

The assignment takes 8 hours and has a 24 hour cooldown from when the assignment completes
