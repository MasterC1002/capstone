1362458861.0,19ot3b,Common mistakes Ball Python owners make,Pareeeee,54,7,45,"I've noticed a lot of errors in BP husbandry while browsing /r/snakes and /r/reptiles. I'm making this post in the hopes of helping BP owners prevent injury and sickness in their snakes.

**Common Mistakes BP Owners Make**

1. Heating with a bulb - what's so bad about this? Well, and secondly, bulbs dry out the enclosure too much. Ball Pythons require 60% humidity, and up to 80% while in shed. Too high humidity can cause respiratory infection. Heat mats or heat tape should be the only heat sources used for these snakes.

2. Not using a thermostat - this is a common

3. Using a Screen Lid or Screen Cage - While BP's do need ventilation, changing the percent of the area covered until the desired percent is reached. (Lid can be modified with a number of things, such as bristol board, cardboard, damp towel, etc.)

4. Underfeeding/Overfeeding - Remember this rule of thumb: feed a prey item that, but it will cause you a lot of headaches down the line: feeding mice. I've never seen a ball python that was of the size to be sold that couldn't handle a rat pinky. If you must feed mice, your snake is almost certainly of a size to be eating hoppers. If you feed mice you will have to switch them to rats one day, and balls aren't big fans of making changes. They will likely resist, it will likely be a huge headache. You will try scenting and braining, you will try priming and disguising, and if you're really unlucky your snake may not reliably eat for years after that. If all you have in your area is petsmart to buy feeders from

5. Improper use of glass terrarium - While the ideal enclosure would be a [plastic tub](http://i.imgur.com/O6aFgGM.jpg)
Ball Pythons live in burrows in the wild, glass tank can be very stressful to them. This can be rectified by making a couple simple modifications: provide plenty of hiding places, and blank out the back and sides of the tank to ensure the snake feels less exposed.

6. Feeding live prey **unsupervised** - This can lead to [serious injury or death](http://i.imgur.com/3tj07GO.jpg). Rats can *easily* kill an adult Ball Python.

7. Not providing a ""cool area"" - All reptiles require a ""cool side"" to their enclosure. They can not thermoregulate if there is no place to cool down. This ""cool side"" should be 80-85F.

8. Housing non-breeding pairs together - this can lead to [cannibalism](http://i.imgur.com/hPf7MG3.jpg)

9. Using ""Heat Rocks"" - pet stores still sell and promote these dangerous pieces of equipment. Because they heat unevenly and can have spikes in temperature

10. *Not properly securing the cage - leading to the eventual escape of the animal. A pile of books or rocks or bricks will work until the day it doesn't. Ball pythons are amazing little escape artists and what may work for years will one day fail and you'll be left snakeless and amazed. If your animal does escape don't give up looking for it too easy. They turn up sometimes months later, with missing snakes start by looking everywhere that you think the snake could possibly be, then look everywhere that you know it can't possibly be.* - thanks /u/blackboxstar for this addition

11. Using hides that are too big/too small - in order for a snake to feel secure, each large enough that your snake can fit its whole body inside, but small enough that the snake will feel safe and protected. Place one hide on the cool end and one on the warm end, over the under-tank-heater. A hide that takes up most of the enclosure is too big. - thanks /u/lapagecp for this suggestion

12. *Not knowing exactly what your husbandry numbers are - You should know what the temperature is down to the degree. You should know whether it changes at night or when the door opens. You should know what it is on the warm side and the cool side, invest in a heat gun.* - thanks /u/blackboxstar for this addition

**Warning signs that something is wrong with your husbandry:**

* [Bad Shed/Shedding in Pieces](http://i.imgur.com/jiNX86O.jpg) (can be removed with a bath and handling with a wet towel)

* [Retained Eye Caps](http://i.imgur.com/Egk5Y7U.jpg) - [Link 2](http://i.imgur.com/Yiokv9U.jpg) (can be removed carefully and gently with wet wash cloth)

* Rubbing - which can cause marks such as [this](http://i.imgur.com/vCbyfxP.jpg). Sign of stress

* [Burns](http://i.imgur.com/wfTnmeP.jpg) **take to vet**

* Respiratory Infection (Whistling or clicking while breathing

* [Mouth Rot](http://redtailboafaq.com/pictures/mouthrot-infection.jpg) - [Link 2](http://i.imgur.com/ZMOug6T.jpg) (uncommon but serious

This is a cautionary tale - and even though her wounds were caused by a botched live rat feeding attempt

I don't quite remember how this lady found me, was terrified of ""Monkey Wrench"" but was unhappy to see her son neglecting his pet. 

She tried to feed the snake by leaving a live

I found out that Monkey Wrench was being kept in a 100 gallon glass aquarium with a mesh lid, and a water bowl with wood shavings as bedding.She had escaped several times. After hearing the mother's tale I knew that this was going to be a challenge. 

The son did not want to sell or give away his snake, awful stuck shed all over her body, and mild scale rot aside from the obvious injury on her head.

[Inital Intake Photo - Pre stuck shed removal](http://i.imgur.com/E2bTvAs.jpg)
[Post stuck shed removal](http://i.imgur.com/Eo542sJ.jpg)

I did not want to get my hopes up - I figured I would give her my best shot and if her health continued to decline the kindest thing to do would to have her euthanized. I took her to my local exotics vet the next day and he gave me 2 weeks worth of broad spectrum antibiotic that I had to inject daily into one of the muscles on her back. I applied polysporin to her head once a day.

[Five days later](http://i.imgur.com/SdJC59Q.jpg)

After five days she seemed to be improving

She would make the most awful gasping noises and could often be found with her head and neck pressed up vertically against the side of the tub. At this point I decided

I named her Manasa

A couple of weeks later
[First shed!](http://i.imgur.com/x0wyVZQ.jpg)

I was thrilled to see how well she was healing up! I was convinced her eye was still gone, I let her sit in my lap for a few minutes. I noticed she seemed really uncomfortable and was dragging the side of her head along my shirt and pants. After a minute or two she settled down and I happened to look down at her. The scab had fallen off! Her eye was deflated but visible, and was leaking what was most likely ocular fluid out of a small hole in the center. I was a little grossed out but I figured her eye would dessicate. Surprisingly, the small hole scabbed up and her eye filled back out within a few days. 

Things only got better from there. 

[Second shed!](http://i.imgur.com/LbmOQAa.jpg)

A few months after taking her in she started eating again. I am so glad she had a decent body weight to start out with or she may not have made it.

So here we are

* [Her bad eye](http://i.imgur.com/E6MVcnn.jpg)
* [The top of her head](http://i.imgur.com/hIJ7NZB.jpg)
* [She's a gorgeous normal](http://i.imgur.com/V6Tkbll.jpg)

So

* Before purchasing your pet, things to expect, local vets that see exotics - in this day and age there is most likely a web forum that can provide guidance and answer any questions you could have. There is no excuse, especially with commonly kept reptiles like ball pythons.

* If you find out your are doing something wrong with your pet, but that comes with the territory and can be avoided if you do extensive research beforehand. If you are questioning any advice you have been given (which I suggest - it's OK to be skeptical) then post on that web forum you have hopefully already found. :)

* If your animal is injured or sick then take it to the vet, especially if you don't live in a larger city. This is a part of your homework before purchasing your animal.

* If you're feeding live food **ALWAYS** supervise your animal and **NEVER** leave the rodent in for more than a few minutes. If your snake is shying away and is obviously not interested

* Make sure to observe your animal's behavior. Learn about signs of stress. The signs are not always obvious

I hope none of that came off as condescending. 

If anyone has any questions please feel free to ask. :) I hope you have enjoyed Manasa's tale!
