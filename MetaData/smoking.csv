I'd ask that if you see any non-food related smoking posts, etc, please flag them. The filter catches most, and even more get flagged, but I still find some occasionally that made it through.  If you see it, flag it.  I'll get rid of it ASAP.

I invited some friends over tonight and made bacon wrapped dates stuffed with blue cheese, and a butterflied chicken. I brined the chicken. Made some cornbread and coleslaw along side. 

Everything turned out so great! I used methods described on amazing ribs and virtual weber bullet as a guide line

1373461973.0,1i06sk,Smoking on a gas grill (not for the purists),GrizzlyDog,22,6,5,"Caveat:  Yes.  I realize this is not charcoal.  I much prefer charcoal to gas.  I would recommend if you are serious to forget my information and buy a WSM or a Weber Kettle grill.  It is superior frankly.  But if you don't here's an alternative.  So for the guys who are going to post ""Just buy a WSM"" or whateves - I know

**Gas grill smoking:**

Here's how I've done it.  I've been smoking with a gas grill for a while myself and it can produce a pretty good result!

Take off one of the end grills and 'flavor plate' (or whatever they call them) that sits on top of the actual burner/venturi.  You know

I have replaced my 'flavor plate' thing with an actual steel grill from an older BBQ cut to fit.  I have it set so I can adjust it's height (creative modifications).   This way I can adjust how close to the flame the smoker box is if it's catching on fire, I take it off and toss another pre-loaded smoke box to continue the smoke.  I find each box lasts about 30-40 mins.  I have 3 or 4 boxes.  I like [these](http://imgur.com/k0ss654).  I use anywhere from 3 to 5 per smoke.  I get smoke rings on my ribs and pork butt just fine.  Flavor is there too (not as nice as charcoal mind you-but sufficiently awesome nonetheless!)

My ribs take about 4-5 hrs like this.  Butts ...well of course they vary and are done when *they* decide they're done (10 hrs?)

Use the other 2/3 of space that still has the grill plates for cooking.   

Use only the burner/venturi where you've removed the top grill for heat and smoke.

[My gas setup](http://imgur.com/pedjHgl)  note: I was done - just blazing the green stuff (what's that?) at the end.

Practice heating the BBQ up to a steady 200-250 degrees.  

When you're sure of that, or whatever.

Now all you have to do is watch the temperature (NOT THE STUPID LID GAUGE (junk)!!!!!  GET A GOOD THERMOMETER - LOTS OF INFO ON THIS AROUND!)  and the smoke.

Now here's another thing I don't necessarily recommend **because it can be dangerous.**  Hear ye

The back of the grill between the lid and the actual grill usually has a long space for venting out the back.   This creates a lot of air flow through (and smoke).   I have taken *thick* fiberglass rope used for sealing wood-stove doors and run it along that space.  I've attached it with long sheet metal screws with washers at the head and with the screw running *through* the rope and into the lid to keep it in place.   I did this and immediately found DANGER!  HOLY CRAP DANGER!  These grills are *clearly* designed to *vent* the heat.  I was getting my BBQ up to 800 degrees FAST!!!!   I pretty much could have melted the damn thing in

So I wound up cutting out about 7"" of that seal so there was *some* venting of the heat (and smoke).  I did this on the far side away from where I put the smoke boxes so the smoke will travel *across* the meat.   This helped

As dangerous as this modification is - it *does* help maintain a more constant temperature with a very low flame on one burner (saves gas too!).  I don't worry about it when it's running like this because it's just not enough heat to melt my deck.

So it's a cautious modification, maintain temp, etc.   You don't need to do this though if you're antsy about safety (or warranty ...MAJOR VOID!).

My ribs and butts work just fine.  They are [tasty](http://imgur.com/bgZ6YPj) and I have no problems finding people to help eat them (or anything I smoke really).

Also, steaks etc.   The nice thing for steaks though is I *let* it crank up to that 700-800 degrees danger zone (carefully monitoring it!!!!) and cook my steaks over that intense heat (watch your face opening the lid).  I get a really good Maillard reaction on the outside and juicy sweetness of red and pink on the inside!  Much like Amazing Ribs has described with his super hot steak cooking methods.   Again, gotta babysit that grill the WHOLE TIME!

That's my info.

Edit: I commented on the gas usage below in one of the threads.  I have to say I simply don't see the kind of major propane use people seem to talk about when I do a day of smoking.  I did 10 hrs on these pork butts on Saturday.  [Here](http://imgur.com/u9xOxOc) they are at about the 7 hr mark.  The bone just pulled out beautifully when they were done at about 195 degrees-ish.  I used a tank that I did ribs on 2 weeks prior to that and in between cooked steaks and dogs

I made small cuts in the pork and push nearly all pieces of garlic inside the slits

I let it sit in the refrigerator for 18 or so hours. I was aiming for a 6p dinner and with a 6.25 cut, 1 hour rest in the cooler post cooking, and 30 minutes for ""crisping"", so I got up at 4a to start.

I made one modification of installing a raised charcoal grate ala the [brinkmann modifications](http://home.comcast.net/~day_trippr/smoker_mods.htm). With the one bottom air hole, it was, during my first few smokes, a challenge to learn temperature control, but I've learned to, use the door to raise and lower the temp along with my home made damper [http://imgur.com/v89Eg](http://imgur.com/v89Eg) which is the bottom of a soda can bolted to an extra curtain rod.

Since the start of the grilling season this year I have been posting photo's of my smoked meats on reddit.com/r/smoking and received a lot of positive feedback.  With every post though I would inevitably get asked about what my process was.  For most subreddits this would be the kind of thing that would go into it's FAQ or what not.  However everyones style of BBQ is different so I decided to write up a document that would give the basics of Texas style BBQ.

Around the world BBQ is more popular than ever.  My guess is that it serves as a connection to our past  and satisfies that primal urge of cooking raw meat over a flame.  Across the globe you will find many styles of BBQ.  From in-ground pit smoking, favored in tropical locales, to the backyard charcoal pits found all over the USA.  

The means and methods of BBQ are many and varied; however, positively no sauce.  Now some folks will argue over the use of the offset smoker vs an upright, or even the newer ""egg"" styles.  However, no one will argue over the abstinence of sauce.  Sure BBQ joints all have a sauce, but that's mainly to placate out-of-towners who don't know any better.  Or, as I call them, heathens!  

I can hear the screams from people in the Carolinas now where sauce reigns supreme.  There's a reason for this though.  You see in Texas we want the meat to shine through.  If we, no matter how good it is, on our meat has just masked any flavor the meat had.

This isn't to say saucing is always bad.  If I'm having a pulled pork or brisket sandwich I'm definitely putting some sauce on it.  But if I'm eating ribs?  All I want is a dry rub.

When I started writing all this down I didn't think it would be all that much.  Now it's been a week since I started writing and what I originally thought would be a quick 250 word post is now sitting at just under five thousand words!  I want to stress though that I am not a professional and this guide is not meant to take you on to be a BBQ cook-off champion.  It is simply meant to help you be a better cook in your own backyard.  

So let's dive in and find out what goes into making Texas BBQ.


**Chapter 1**: *The Cooker &amp; Other Supplies*

**The Pit**

There are numerous styles of BBQ pits

It's not uncommon to want to do a brisket, a medium size horizontal offset will be perfect.  For a frame of reference, my smoker's cooking area is about 3 1/2' x 1 1/2' and I easily did 9 racks of ribs for a party recently (using 2 rib racks).

The single most important thing to look for when shopping for a smoker is the thickness of the steel.  The thinner the steel the more heat will escape.  A nice thick housing is best.  That said you will pay more for a thicker cooker so keep that in mind.  

Now, they are correct.  But guess who has the easier time moving their smoker around -- those with their standing upright, or me with my offset on wheels?  I'll take wheels every time; not to mention the vastly increased cooking area that the offsets provide.

So which one should you buy?  That's really for you to decide.  If all you can budget for is a WSM then get it!  If you have some money to burn then I've seen some at my local store in the four figure range!  Like I said though

If you do decide to go the offset route I highly recommend modifying it.  Unfortunately, a tuning plate under the grill should be in place to force all the smoke to the other end before it can pop up and run back over the meat to the chimney mouth.

That said

Grillinfools.com has a great pictorial on how to make these modifications.  http://grillinfools.com/blog/2009/03/16/offsethorizontal-smoker-modifications/

If your smoker did not come with a built in thermometer then the first thing you need to do is add one.  Since you're already adding one I recommend you add two!  You will want one on each side so that you can easily monitor both sides of the cooking area.  When you install them be sure to place them so that the sensors are at meat level otherwise they won't give you an accurate reading. 
Other Supplies

Aside from the cooking pit itself

The way they work is by simply wadding up a bunch of newspaper (I use my junk mail!) and shoving it into the bottom and then filling the top with wood chunks.  Then just light the paper on fire and in about 10 minutes you'll be ready to start.

Another item that you will need is a shovel.  Not necessarily a big one, but I prefer to add the flavor of Apple Cider Vinegar.  You can also use a fruit juice if you prefer (Apple juice is very common).  

You will also need some clean dish towels and some bath towels (this may sound strange but you'll find out why a little while later - I promise!).  Finally most meats need to be wrapped at some point during the cook.  One popular wrap is foil

The last thing I want to talk about before we get to the wood is a fire pit.  The single biggest mistake I made when starting out was to just add cold wood to the firebox as the temperature dropped below my target.  The problem with that method is that it can take to long for the new wood to ""catch up"" to where you need it to be.  For this reason I started using a fire pit.  Cold logs are added to the fire pit where they are turned to coals

The added bonus of the fire pit is that it keeps me warm at 2am when I'm cooking a brisket for the next day!

Finally we get to the wood.  This is considered by some to be the most important thing when it comes to Texas BBQ

For starting my fire I use hickory chunks

The important thing with wood is to get it aged.  That means you want wood that's been sitting in a nice dry place for 6+ months after being cut.  This will provide you with a nice long burn with plenty of flavorful smoke.
Prepping the Pit

The last thing that you need to do before you start cooking is to burn in your new smoker.  This means filling up the firebox and letting it go for a few hours to burn out all the oils that were applied to the metal during construction and shipping preparations.

The last thing you want is for those chemicals to get in to your food and make you sick.  Usually you can tell when the process is done because you won't smell any more nasty/funky smells coming from the pit.

While your doing this you can calibrate your pit by laying out slices of bread across the cooking area and seeing how dark each slice gets after 5

Once this is done you will want to put in a bowl for water (or another liquid of your choosing).  This bowl can go underneath the main grill and should be placed near the firebox to ensure that it boils off and releases it's steam to assist with keeping the meat moist.  When you're cooking make sure the bowl is always full of whatever liquid you chose to use.

Next question: Since it seems that I would have to use a relatively small amount of coals to keep a consistent 225F (my target)

A little bit of rub on the ribs will not do the job, if it is not falling off, there is not enough on there.""  So I opened the ribs, rinsed them off, patted them dry, and began caking it on.

(third total smoke) I followed the directions more or less from [amazingribs.com](http://amazingribs.com/recipes/beef/texas_brisket.html) and it tasted really good.  After about 4 hours I put it in a tin foil tub with some beef broth I had left over from the injection.  I covered it well and stuck it back on the smoker. I went with the crutch since it was my first time and I didn't want to risk having it taste like crap.  I like beef a lot more than pork and will most likely be doing these a lot more often.  

What I noticed was that it I didn't have a definite smoke ring.  I put in a probably (6) 2 oz chunks of hickory and a couple half burnt chunks from my last smoke.  The wood I am using I bought from a firewood lot and came as split logs.  I cut them down to smaller chunks myself. I guess it just seems like I am not generating much smoke.  Maybe it was that I ""braised"" the smoke ring out of the meat.  What do you think?  When you use the crutch do you guys add any liquid?

I know that this isn't the only way to prep and cook a brisket, here's how I do. What about you guys?

-=-

If you're a seasoned smoker

**To brine or to rub?**

The rule of thumb when deciding whether to brine or rub is fairly simple. If you have lots of surface area but not a lot of volume (like with ribs), in this case, a brisket), use a brine and let it work its way through the meat over time. More specifically, introduce extra fluids to the meat. In this case, inject with a solution of your choice. With briskets, I let the meat do the flavoring for me

**Rendering...**

The key ingredient to any well-smoked piece of meat is temperature. Three temperatures for brisket, but that's too hot for my tastes.

The second and third temperatures are the point and the flat. These two muscles in the meat are marbled differently and will reach your target meat temperatures at different times and at different rates. I use the temperature probes that I bought with my [Rock's BBQ Stoker](https://www.rocksbarbque.com/) and keep tabs on both of the probe temps on my iPhone or iPad. 

Probe placement makes a difference, or you'll get bum readings. For the point, I'll insert the probe near the center of the muscle, also orienting it along the longitudinal axis of the meat. Be mindful to not punch through the interstitial fat layer, since the fat will increase in temp much faster than the muscle, and you'll get bad readings there, also.

**Ssssssmokin!**

A common misconception with smoking is that visible white smoke is necessary to impart the smoke flavor and to give the meat a ""smoke ring."" The truth is that the flavor you seek does not require visible smoke as a carrier. In fact, and that's bad juju, boss. So long as your fire is hot enough (and oxygen scarce enough) to char your smoke wood, you're doing alright. Charring the wood produces nitrates which interact with the myoglobin in the meat, and that's what gives you the smoke ring and smoke flavor.

A note on the smoke ring is that it's easy to get a smoke ring by using sodium nitrite curing salt on the surface of the meat. The salt reacts with the myoglobin and voila

Science!

**Quit yer stallin'!**

About 3 to 4 hours into the cook, and as it works its way to the surface and evaporates away, it draws heat away and cools the meat. This is the same as the effect that sweat has on the surface of your skin; that is, you're watching evaporative cooling taking place.

There are two schools of thought on what to do with the stall. The first is just to let it do its thing. Maintain your chamber temperature and monitor your meat temperatures

The second school of thought is...

**Crutch much?**

The ""Texas Crutch"" or, humid environment for your meat to cook in. You can achieve this by putting the whole durned thing into a covered aluminum pan with a cup of apple juice or some such fluid, or by double wrapping the brisket in aluminum foil with 1/4 cup of apple juice and putting it back in the cooker. Alternatively, you can just use butcher paper and wrap it like a burrito, but I've never done that, so I can't comment on its effectiveness. No matter how you crutch it, you'll see the internal temp bust right through the stall and start climbing to your target temps.

Two important things, aluminum, liquid, and heat get together for an orgy of science and electricity that will cause the aluminum to melt, welding (fusing?) it to the steel pan.

**Targeting...**

The target temperature for a brisket is debatable. Something we know for a fact, and haven't been displeased with my results.

**Rest and Relaxation**

At this point

What I do is line the bottom of an empty cooler with a towel, meat, and all. The towel doesn't act as an extra insulator to keep heat in the cooler, it's just something to keep from melting the bottom of the cooler. You do, however, want to close the lid to trap the radiating heat inside of the cooler.

I monitor the meat temperature during the rest

**Aaaaand CUT!**

The two muscles in the brisket have grains in different orientations in relation to one another. The grain of the flat runs along the length of the brisket, then you've cooked too long. Try pulling the meat from the cooker at a lower target temp next time.

The grain of the point runs the width of the brisket, but I just leave it be.

Serve the meat immediately upon slicing

I checked on it and dropped to 210f so I added more coals and it shot up to over 300f and I couldn't get it down(my smoker isn't modded yet and has no adjustable vents on top or bottom) so I put in the water pan and now it went to 200f and is slowly dropping.

The only issue is that the walls are too thin to retain sufficient heat.

My initial attempt with the smoker ended up burning through the chips way too fast

The meat ended up absorbing a lot more of the smoke flavour than I expected but needed to be cooked still afterwards as the surface barely received enough heat to even effect the rub. The total time in the smoker was probably ~3 hours minus all the time messing around with changing the wood chips and messing with the temperature(at which point I decided to cut my losses and cook it because the temps weren't getting high enough).

**My questions for you guys are:**

* What temps should I be aiming at to provide sufficient smoke without burning through the chips too fast?

* Is there a time relation between cold vs hot smoking that I can use to calculate how long to cold smoke before I cook?

* Are there specific recipes that you could suggest that work better with cold smoking than hot?

I realize that I could insulate the smoker to raise the internal temperature but I thought I'd give cold smoking a shot.

Day Before: ""Today""

1. Can you put on too much yellow mustard ?
2. Can you put on too much rub ?
3. My rub and mustard turned into thick brownish paint is this normal ? (Kind of worried as here in Australia this type of cooking is rare and I have never seasoned anything with more than a light sprinkle of spices before putting on what you Americans call a Grill and we call a BBQ).
4. 3.2kg / 7lb Boston Butt in the fridge wrapped in plastic with mustard + rub.

Day of the smoke: **(Is it acceptable to drill a small hole in the side of my smoker for my probe wires ? I will have no problem holding heat as I live in the sub tropics.)**

1. 6am start, 9kg Gas + spare 9kg gas I use for my grill, Gas Smoker I seasoned the other day.

2. Temperature is fairly hot here during the day 30 C / 86 F My Smoker while seasoning was holding at around 130 C / 266 F in the afternoon on lowest setting. I would like to stay in the 225 / 250 F range but would 250 - 300 F still give me a good end product ?

3. Where do I place my meat probe ? Into the centre of the tubes ? To me the tubes seem to be the biggest part of the butt with no bone close by to put the temperature off. Am I thinking correctly here ?

4. How many chunks should I start with and how do I know to add more ? **&lt;---- This is really the only thing that is giving me a little bit of panic.**

4. I am ready for the stall

5. What temperature should I remove my butt ? I have read about this and every ones idea is different. I would like an easy juicey pull but would also like to carve the money muscle and tubes. Suggested temps please ?

Are there any charcoal rings that I could employ so I don't have to use so much charcoal to get a smoke?  It took an entire bag of briquettes just to fill it up halfway.

I used the Minion method and had to close every single vent, then towards the end I was finally able to crack only one of the dampers at the bottom.  Anything more and the heat would skyrocket.

In the end, and I am excited to own this product.  I noticed that the ribs were cooked perfectly in terms of smoke flavor, but that the smoke flavor/color did not permeate all the way through the turkey legs.

12 Drummies and 10 Thighs and
2 Full Salmon Fillets
CAME OUT AWESOME!


I have been reading that you can simply marinate and then just Air Dry the thin beef strips until they become Beef Jerky?   It seems like this is old meat that you wouldn't normally eat.   Is this okay to do?

2. How different is doing an all-wood smoke relative to charcoal (i've used briquettes and lump).  More maintenance? less?

3. is there anything else i should be aware of?  How consistent is the smoke flavor across multiple smokes?  I generally use briquettes and wrap pecan chunks in foil to smolder slowly.

as always

oh! this is a test run for the *important* smoke.

UPDATE:  The smoke went very well this sunday.  It took some time to get the fire going.  What I really needed to realize was that it takes a bit of wood to sustain some coals, i put one full log on that had not fully turned to coals, i think two would have been better.

Chamber 1 would hold the electric smokers. Standard sealing door on the front, up through Chamber 1, exhaust to Chamber 2 and then on out the roof. Chamber 2 would be for cold smoking.

Hot mode:

* Chamber 1 hot mode: hot smoke on the MBES and standard Big Chief usage. 
* Chamber 2 hot mode: just passes the smoke through.

Cold mode:

* Chamber 1 cold mode: just uses the Big Chief slightly open to generate smoke.

I want to make sure I'm going to do this correctly.  I'm planning on doing a pork loin as it was recommended for beginners.  Does this sound right?

Night before: make dry rub and apply to meat

Day of: take meat out of fridge to come to room temp.  start full chimney of chunk charcoal and put in side fire box.  take a handful of wood chunks and place on the charcoal.  Wait for temps to get to 225* or so and throw on the pork loin.  Check temps every 30 mins or so and adjust vents as needed.  Cook loin to 155* and then foil it and pull.  Let it sit 20-30 mins and slice and enjoy!!

Am I missing anything?  Do I need to soak the wood chips?  Any flavor recommendations for pork?  Do I need a water pan where the smoke enters the cooking chamber?  Do I need to put the charcoal from the starter onto more unburned charcoal or will I be ok with one starter full since this won't take very long?  Sorry for all the questions

**EDIT 1**: Thanks for all the help.  I'm going to pull the meat closer to 145* now and foil it and let carryover take it the rest of the way.  

I have a couple other questions though.  My firebox has the charcoal tray and it also has grates.  The charcoal tray has a bottom and grates on it as well.  See pic [here](http://www.chargriller.com/components/com_virtuemart/shop_image/product/Ashpan_Fire_Grat_4cb401ca68104.jpg).  Do I put the charcoal on the charcoal tray grates or do I put it in the tray itself?  And should I remove the cooking grates in the firebox when smoking?

* I've been trying to figure out what 'blue smoke' is? How to achieve it

* I understand that smoking meats with propane is a 'no no' cause the byproduct of burning propane is water that doesn't mix well with the smoke. So why the water pan in so many pictures of smokers?

* Do I really need a rib rack or do you have some suggestions of alternatives?

* I've got a few meat thermometers and I'm not sure they're any good. Is there a simple cheap way of testing / calibrating them?

Fast forward 7.5 hrs the 2 chickens I put in tasted FANFUCKINGTASTIC! Though I had 2 problems that I'd like some advice on before trying again.

Unfortunately due to the days events I didn't get started till mid afternoon. I figured it would take 6 hrs tops for  2 - 3.5 pound chickens. It took over 7.5 hours.

My question is

Second (and more serious) problem: Black soot like substance on the birds. The top chicken had more soot on it than the bottom chicken. What can I do to prevent this? I suspect it is a venting problem. I was playing around with the vent covers to keep my temp where I wanted it. I alternated all of the vent covers including the top one on the lid from fully open to 1/2 open depending on the heat.

1358784597.0,16zrtd,PartyQ Review,ishavedtreebeard,7,1,7,"For Christmas my wife bought me a PartyQ to use with my Weber kettle and Smokenator. It's been a little chilly lately and I've been too busy so this past weekend was the first time I was able to give it a go.  

**Setup**: The PartyQ was super easy to install. All I needed to do was drill a 7/8"" hole in the side of my kettle. I ended up going with [Meathead's](http://amazingribs.com/tips_and_technique/smokenator_tips.html) suggestion and drilling the hole next to the Smokenator and slightly below the cooking grate. After that you just pop the PartyQ into the hole and screw it in place with a supplied wing nut. (Incidentally

**Brisket Prep**: I bought a 10 lb brisket from a local meat market ([Bichelmeyer Meats](http://bichelmeyermeatskc.com/). If you live anywhere near Kansas City, the ingredients are a trade secret.)  

**The Cook**: I fired up the grill at about 7:00 AM. I packed the Smokenator with Kingsford Competition Briquets and apple chips (I thought I had enough chunks but I was sadly mistaken and ended up having to settle for chips.) I used about 10 lit coals which is more than I usually do but it was fairly chilly and windy in KC on Saturday so I wanted to make sure I had enough heat.  

Once the Smokenator was loaded up it took about 30 minutes to get up to temp. The PartyQ manual said there could be some overshoot with the temp when firing up but I found that it brought it right up to 225^o and held it there. 

The PartyQ held the temp at 225^o all freaking morning like a champ. For about three hours I watched it like a hawk but it hardly fluctuated more than five degrees in either direction. At one point my wife and I left for about an hour and a half to get coffee and groceries and when I came back it was still pumping along at the perfect temp.  

**I Done Went and Fucked Up:** After lunch I started playing with my son and then he fell asleep with me on the couch watching basketball. During that time I neglected to keep an eye on the fuel and as a result

I was afraid I'd fucked it up but after finishing it in the oven to a final internal temp of 205^o and then letting it rest in a cooler for a couple hours until dinner time it actually turned out very tasty and the moisture level was just right. And this cook was the first time in five briskets that I got a really good smoke ring. I'm not sure if it was because I used mustard instead of olive oil to coat the brisket but that was the only thing I could think of that I did significantly different from my previous cooks.  

Overall

Next time I do a smoke on a chilly day I might just try using a stack of charcoal against one side of the smoker plus a water pan so I can use more charcoal from the beginning.

It arrived on Thursday

I smoked the meat for 7 hours, but I highly doubt it). It kinda tasted similar to when you grill something on a big campfire, just in an extremer way. There was a very nice smokering though, so in terms of smoking I'd say it wasn't a complete disaster :D

**Problems/flaws** I'm aware of (but often can't tell if they are important and a big factor in why my smoke didn't go as planned):

* not knowing how to handle a smoker (specially the different airways

* had to open the lid to messure the inner temperature every time I wanted to check it (which was way too often)

* The taste of the meat was very strong

* no idea how to handle the exhaust fume cap

Normally I would just take the instructions advice but after watching you tube videos I have seen a combination of MAX HEAT with wood 3-4 hours and MAX HEAT no wood 3 - 4 hours.

Would a low temperature smoke for 45 - 60 minute smoke actually season this ? Or should I do something else ? 

Not bringing the smoker up to at least cooking temperature seems a little strange as the paint could still give off some pretty nasty stuff right ?

You can also use this in a gas or charcoal grill to get smoke flavor on whatever you are cooking. You can use as much or as little pellets as you want as long as there is enough to keep them lit.

Those with the skills, if you lack the materials, skills, equipment and/or time..... it is well worth the money. It will use any pellet, chip or dust sold for smokers.

Using electric smokers is out because there will be no access to electricity. A wood smoker might work but the issues I have are it would be bulky

The solution I have and would like you guys to comment on the feasibility of is as follows: I would build a criss-cross of driftwood that looks like a log cabin. Part way up I would build a ""shelf"" to smoke the fish on and then continue the walls up further. I would then cover the whole thing with a tarp and then get my fire going in the middle of the ""cabin"". I would leave an opening near the bottom so the fire can breathe. The walls would be far enough away to not light on fire.

Since I'm sure it's somewhat easier to look at a picture [here is a sketch I made up](http://imgur.com/9QtT1N3).

I guess the fire would need to be more embers than fire? From what I can read slow cooking is a slow process and can take a few days? How often will the fire need to be tended? Is this even a reasonable idea?

I got a 5 lb bone-in cut of pork butt from the local butcher, so I didn't open the main door at all.  I used the MB internal temp gauge that shot the temp to my remote control.

I cooked at 210* for about 4 hours

Internal temp smoothly moved up, but wouldn't go any higher.  

I ended up pulling the butt out at about 8 hours when it was still at 177

I cut it up and it was delicious - especially the end pieces with the crust (bark?) on it.  The pork cut a lot more like a pork tenderloin than pulled pork though.  Have at me, I would get better results if i ditched the electric.  This is my introduction / lazy man's approach to getting into smoking.

Being my first time with a real smoker, but great, and everyone was happy.

Now that that's over, as it has the warming plate on the fire box, the prep table is wire instead of wood, and the legs are bolted on to the body, instead of being that rolled tube structure with wheels I've seen otherwise. Can anyone ID this smoker?

Also

1) (unrelated to this smoker) How do vertical smokers like the WSM work? I thought that if the meat was over the coals/heat source

2) All the grates were missing on this smoker, but they're halfway up the body of the smoker, isn't that high? It seems like you waste a lot of space this way and wouldn't be able to fit things like turkeys in there otherwise.

3) How does a gas conversion work? I seem to understand that you can replace the charcoal with a gas burner and lava rocks

4) I went through two 5lb bags of wood chips in smoking this turkey. Based on what I've read

5) Do you want to add thermal mass to the smoker body? I bake a lot of bread and have a 40lb marble slab in the oven which helps out a lot. Do you want the same kind of thing in the smoker

Maybe a lot of my questions are better answered in other places

I am thinking about building an electric UDS. I learned about UDS here and did many google searches but have yet to see anyone showing instructions on how to build thoroughly.

I never owned a smoker before

I would like to go with an electric smoker as I think it'll be easier for me to set it and forget it while I'm at work. I have a PID temperature controller that I'll be using for building my homebrewing equipment as well. 

So it looks like I need a barrel (which I can find with a lid for $35 locally apparently). Thinking about an oven heating element which can be purchased at around 15 to 20 bucks. 

I know that I need a tray for drip pan, and of course something to put the meat on. 

Now while building it, wood chips and lastly the water bowl. Is this the order I should be following? Or should it be more like: Heating element at the bottom, wood chip bowl next, and water bowl to also use as drip pan etc?

Also what about the horizontal order of these things like what has to be or shouldn't be directly above/below of each other? I'll be going to home depot to find one of these things assembled and check out how it is but considering I really haven't seen any before I'm thinking I might not be able to find one to investigate.

Thanks for all the help in advance.",self,t5_2qkku,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/smoking/comments/1dvy4o/anyone_built_an_electric_uds/

But I've never smoked anything.


So I've been reading around online and I still have some questions:

* Should the chips be on one side (indirect heat) or spread over the whole surface of the tray?

* I've seen some suggestions that I soak my chips in water for an hour or two and other arguments that it doesn't make a difference either way. What say y'all? Are we soakers here?

* Is 225 the magic temperature for my pseudo-smoker? How closely do I need to adhere to this number?

* Is there anything obvious that I'm missing or not thinking of?
