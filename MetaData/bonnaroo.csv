1371650153.0,1gnl1f,My spiritual moment at Bonnaroo,cmcdonald1337,449,44,50,"I had a deep and powerful connection with a complete stranger. Just one brother helping out another

So it was Thursday night and I was at Alt-J with my two friends and my girlfriend. I was a bit dehydrated and a little burnt out.

I started feeling a little woozy and I broke out into a cold sweat (never a good sign). Suddenly My face went super cold and I fell HARD, so this was a bad situation.

So I was out cold for a solid 20 seconds at this point. One friend went to get a medic while my buddy and my girlfriend tried to get me up to no avail. My girlfriend (god bless her) shouted desperately for help.

Suddenly this guy comes out from the crowd and grabs my hand. He jerked me up to my feet (I weigh 170, put his other hand on my chest and said ""Look at me! You're right here brother, you're good. Just breathe, drink some water you'll be fine"" and I snapped right out of it.

In that moment, and he genuinely wanted to help me out. I never got his name, but I gave him a huge hug and a thank you before leaving the crowd. I could tell he felt that bond too, we shared a spiritual moment. He was just getting me back to real life, and was willing to do just about anything to keep me on my feet.

If you had the patience to read this, and I'm going to treat them all accordingly. Thanks Bonnaroo, I love you and I'll see you next year.

1368023230.0,1dxlgw,The 50 Bonnaroo Pro Tips I compiled 2 months ago!!!,Aristartle,155,19,90,"**This is a repost

**Edit #2** I also had a Bonnaroo Beginner's Thread that people enjoyed. If this is your first rodeo



Here are the tips

**Food and Water**

1. Get dry ice. Wrap it in a towel

2. Bring double the water you need

3. Buy a camelback. Check woot

4. Bring real food. Use the above methods to keep it frozen. Eat this the first couple days to ensure it doesn't go bad. Cook it on...

5. A grill. Again

6. Bring a lot of snacks to. Even if you don't eat it all, delicious, and easy for on-the go.

7. Make yourself eat breakfast. As in food, you'll have energy early and late.

8. The 'Jesus Tent' is a good place to check out for breakfast. Free water, and coffee. While you're there, they have free phone chargers you can use. 

9. Get the Fish Tacos. Just do it. And the nearby lemonade. Be warned

**Campsite**

10. Get a flag or balloon and fly it above your tent. 

11. The sun is going to bake your tent very early. Get a silver tarp, it will create a pocket of hot air above your tent and you'll still bake. **Mylar blanket/sheet works much better than a tarp for this purpose, but may be noisy if you aren't careful.**

12. Bring a collapsable water container for free easy showers. Fill this with free water at night

13. Have some sort of shade structure. Eazy-up canopies seem to be popular, blankets, sheets, etc.

14. Have a battery operated fan

15. ""Unpack quickly. While you want to be neighborly

16. Have one of he following three: An air mattress

17. Have some sort of pee bottle. Its gross

18. Earplugs may make it much easier to sleep some nights due to late night shows you may not want to see

19. Have towels. You don't know what you may need them for.

20. Have a mallet for staking things in the ground.

21. Do not forget your chairs. Bring one extra for the one that will break. 

22. Have a safe to lock valuables up

**Clothing**

19. Footwear is important. Do not rely on flipflops. In fact

20. You know to bring cool stuff

21. Underwear

22. Bring a bandana! Or a hat. Or both...

23. Sunglasses are also a good idea...

**First-Aid/Health Items**

1. Sunscreen. Use this excessively. Bring extra.

2. Any toiletries you want to use or normally use. 

3. A tub to soak your feet in with some epson salt may help reduce soreness and increase stamina for the next day.

4. Alcohol Wipes/ **Baby Wipes** are a good idea. Sanitize your privates

5. Babypowder for your thighs. Chafing may attack at anytime. And remember

**Misc

1. Have a headlamp.

2. Beware of cops on the way down and the way home. The closer you are to Bonnaroo

3. Fill your tank within 20 miles of Bonnaroo. You need the gas for waiting in the line

4. Facing the main stage

5. Cinema tent = Air conditioning and some unexpectedly good flicks 

6. Know how badly you want to see comedians. The line can get pretty long because so many people want to go. Last year Aziz was worth it. It all depends on your interests

7. Check out new things. New people, new food, new anything. Bonnaroo has so much to offer. Experience as much as possible.

8. Bring extra toilet paper.

9. Go to the bathroom at the gas station you stop at before going in. You will wait in line. 

10. Have extra lighters.

11. Don't think Thursday and Sunday aren't worth it. Come as early as you can

12. Bring toys, a deck of cards, a frisbee, etc...

13. Explore! This lets you find new things and get better acquainted with Bonnaroo. The more you explore

14. There are other entrances besides the main gate. If the line is really long

15. Hug the people in the free hug shirts.

16. If there is any chance you may try a drug for the first time (be realistic with yourself going in) then read up on it before hand. Know what you are getting into and don't freak out.

17. Share with your neighbors. 

18. Ask and you shall receive. ",self,t5_2rg7a,1368067563.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/1dxlgw/the_50_bonnaroo_pro_tips_i_compiled_2_months_ago/

* **Obstructed view:** make sure you can see out your back window!

* **Riding too close on someone:** make sure the person in front of you has plenty of room.

* **Not using turning signals to shift lanes:** use them blinkers!

* **Littering!:** We're supposed to be green anyway
&gt; **ALSO KNOW THAT THROWING A CIGARETTE BUTT OUT OF THE WINDOW IS CONSIDERED LITTERING IN TN, that's usually an easy one)

* **SEATBELTS!:** Buckle up.

* **Make sure all blinkers

* **KEEP YOUR SPEED DOWN!:** Theyre lowering speeds all through TN! Keep an eye on your speed and don't go over!

* **If you pass a car (especially a semi)

* **Avoid passing too many people altogether:** Just goooo with the floooow man.

* **WRITING ON YOUR WINDOWS:** Bonnaroo bound all over your windows is just asking to get pulled over!

* **Have your co-pilot man your cell phone!:** Avoid having it in your hand at all. The naughty texts can wait

* **Wear some plain clothes on the way up:** Your awesome, scant festival wear is awesome at roo, but try to wear some normal garb on the way up. The loud clothing is a cop magnet.

* **Keep your eye on the road!:** Have a passenger grab the next CD or the cell phone you dropped in the floor. Taking your eyes off the road for one moment can cause you to swerve.

Also remember to keep an updated insurance card and registration in your car. Don't forget your ID! MAKE SURE YOUR VEHICLE REGISTRATION IS UP TO DATE. If it's not

**Know your rights.** You don't have to consent to a search, even if all you wanted was to get on your way to get in line for roo.

**When you get to Roo

**Download the app WAZE!** It's a social GPS where lots of Roogoers (including my crew) will be reporting cops &amp; speed traps in real time! Make sure your copilot handles this as well. ;)

**If you like to, try to avoid it on the way to roo.** If you DO get pulled over, the second they smell anything, they'll have probable cause to search your vehicle. No bueno.",,False,self,1371014169.0,t3_1g6edi

**Getting to Bonnaroo**

Let's start with getting there.  I wouldn't recommend bringing anything with you when you go.  Why bring sand to the beach?  If you're bringing to sell then you should already know the risks.  Talking about how to get things in over a public forum is a bad idea. 

A) You're labeling yourself as a dealer online and I'm going to wager it's not the best idea.  B) You're making the tips and tricks of getting things into festivals more widely known and thus less useful.  

The only tip I'll give you if you're bringing things in, and nicely trimmed hair will help.  Looking like a dirty hippy is going to raise red flags.



**Getting Your Goodies**

So you've gotten into the festival and not been arrested. Congrats!  Now set up your camp very quickly and decide one of two routes.  If you're there early then dealers will be walking around camps.  Wednesday night until Thursday at about 5 or 6 pm is when the dealers are most mobile. Sit in your camp


Some things are more common and festival appropriate to ask for than others, I promise.  

Protip: Don't be fucked up while you're looking for drugs.  It's easy to be taken advantage of or with pupils the size of saucers ask a policeman if he knows where some molly can be found.  Keep everything you get either on your person or in your locked car

**Particular Drugs**

I wouldn't recommend trying anything you're not familiar with at Bonnaroo

**Dosages**

If you intend on buying anything it makes sense to have a scale with you.  Not getting ripped off is a plus

**Pot**

It's everywhere, security looked at me, laughed, and gave me a little nod.  Virtually nobody there cares if you smoke at any point in time.  Don't bring your own glass piece as it WILL be taken if they find it at the check, bring rolling papers and buy a $10 one hitter when you get there.

**MDMA**

Don't buy ecstasy pills please.  I'm not talking to the responsible reader who has their own testing kit

If you're going to take it know the following.  A) Bring gum, molly will dehydrate you, you will be dancing, you will be sweating.  Please don't be stupid, this is the number one cause of shitty times at Bonnaroo.  You already should be drinking 10+ bottles of water per day, so what's 4 more?

**LSD**

It's much more common on the early days than the later ones to stock up.  Roughly $10 per hit from what I've seen, especially in a setting with 100,000 people.  There is bunk acid at Roo just like any other festival.  Being a good judge of character is really your only hope for avoiding bad acid 100% of the time.  As with Molly I'd suggest increasing your water intake.

**Shrooms**

They come in to forms generally, there are bunk chocolates so be careful who you buy from.  Prices on shrooms are much higher at the festival than I've ever seen outside of it at $40-60 an eighth.  As with anything, increase water intake and don't do it if you're not experienced.  Shrooms has a lower freak out rate, but a higher feeling ill rate.  Perfect ways to ruin an evening if you don't know what you're dealing with.  As with acid, it's most common on Thursday and Friday and more difficult to acquire on Saturday or Sunday.

**DMT**

DMT will be there

**Others**

I'm not experienced with anything else really.  I know opium and cocaine are there in smaller amounts

**Closing Thoughts**

Please be smart. Here are a few basic rules I have always followed at Roo in regards to such things.

1. Don't bring anything with you.
2. Drink more water if you take anything.
3. Don't take anything you're not experienced and/or very familiar with.
4. Don't get so fucked up you can't enjoy the music.
5. Have a buddy to do things with
6. Don't feel pressured to do something every night or even at all

Check out http://www.erowid.org/ for all the information you need on any given drug you are thinking about trying.  The more literature you read on the subject

- Frozen lemonade is huge

- If you get lost

- Drink/Do drugs at night… the heat is not something to mess with 

- Make a rendezvous point with your friends to that if you get separated during a show

Post any thing you've learned to do to make Bonnaroo more enjoyable here.

u/sirhobotooth offered this great advice that prompted this thread: 

Want a free ""almost"" shower every morning? Pick up one of those collapsible 5 gal water containers with a spigot

I'll add another tip here as well: 

Those toilet seats can get extremely gross. You can grab an extremely cheap toilet seat for very cheap at a dollar store or something like that, and use it when you go near your camp...

Additions:

u/kmentropy brought up a great point about being a good neighbor. Let me add to this and say for anyone prone to feeling awkward meeting new people, the more likely you'll begin to 'feel' too awkward to just walk up. Do it when everyones wrapped up in the excitement of just getting there and help people set up camp. You'll be guaranteed friends for the entire weekend.

I did have a few quick thoughts on what I did enjoy and what I do think could be improved upon

Loved:

-The vibe!  Absolutely everyone I talked to was interested in meeting new people and were glad to make friends and get to know one another.  I made a lot of great new connections from people all over the country

-Staffing / security: Aside from one unfortunate omission, welcoming, etc.  I really felt cared for my entire time there and felt as if I was in a safe environment.  Even the mounted security were extremely pleasant and compromised and worked with my wife and I when we were having difficulty getting our truck out of the roadway for our spot.

-I was also really happy with the sound on the main stages.  We could hear bands clearly when we were far away, I thought it was great.

-Prices for concessions / dinner: I was also pleasantly surprised with how relatively inexpensive most things were.  They were higher than they'd normally be in the ""real world, Jim and Nick's BBQ was my favorite!

-Bonnaroo ""magic.""  I don't know if it's a typical experience or if I was just really lucky, and even got to meet The Lumineers after we went to the Ed Helms comedy show.  I'd read from some attendees that this kind of ""magic"" happens, but I wasn't really planning on having as much good fortune.  I'm a believer now!

Didn't Like:

-I ran the Roo Run 5K Saturday morning, and there was a lot of miscommunication beforehand about many of the details that still were never fully explained on site.

-I'm also not a huge fan of those who somewhat inconsiderately put out blankets or lie down so close to what clearly are standing only areas.  It makes it incredibly difficult to navigate around without stepping on someone

-The pit line for the Lumineers that my wife and I waited four hours for was a real mess.  About half of the line cut in front of about 100+ people, but still had to rely on baseless and largely inconclusive he said, she said information to conclude who cut and who didn't.  From what I saw, the pit lines seemed to be very poorly organized in general.  I'm not sure why they don't just hand out numbered tickets in a way similar to the way the Comedy Tent is handled.

-I know it's luck of the draw, nevermind a spot far away from an entrance.

-I also wasn't entirely happy with how the Mumford / Jack Johnson situation played out, really looking forward to seeing Mumford and I'm still bummed out about it, but not too badly since nothing could have been done anyways.

I don't think I need to say that things have been dicey lately in the great US of A. 

With that in mind

Security will be tighter this year, a determined mind will find a way. 

I challenge you, then it probably isn't. Don't be afraid to report something that is out of place. It is better to be safe than sorry. They are few, and we are many. 

All I am asking is that you be aware of your surroundings. You don't have to be paranoid and afraid

I refuse to let that fear dictate my actions. I will be having a fantastic weekend and am looking forward to some artists I've never seen. I will not let my family and friends fret over my safety should they suddenly see Bonnaroo in the headlines. I've enjoyed this festival for many years

I wish you all a great weekend! If you happen to see the Blackhawks flag in the back of the Walmart

tl;dr is that MDMA use can disrupt your brain's serotonin levels as well as ability to restore those levels. 5-HTP

**Food and Water**

1. Get dry ice. Wrap it in a towel

2. Bring double the water you need

3. Buy a camelback. Check woot

4. Bring real food. Use the above methods to keep it frozen. Eat this the first couple days to ensure it doesn't go bad. Cook it on...

5. A grill. Again

6. Bring a lot of snacks to. Even if you don't eat it all, delicious, and easy for on-the go.

7. Make yourself eat breakfast. As in food, you'll have energy early and late.

8. The 'Jesus Tent' is a good place to check out for breakfast. Free water, and coffee. While you're there, they have free phone chargers you can use. 

9. Get the Fish Tacos. Just do it. And the nearby lemonade. Be warned

**Campsite**

10. Get a flag or balloon and fly it above your tent. 

11. The sun is going to bake your tent very early. Get a silver tarp, it will create a pocket of hot air above your tent and you'll still bake.

12. Bring a collapsable water container for free easy showers. Fill this with free water at night

13. Have some sort of shade structure. Eazy-up canopies seem to be popular, blankets, sheets, etc.

14. Have a battery operated fan

15. ""Unpack quickly. While you want to be neighborly

16. Have one of he following three: An air mattress

17. Have some sort of pee bottle. Its gross

18. Earplugs may make it much easier to sleep some nights due to late night shows you may not want to see

19. Have towels. You don't know what you may need them for.

20. Have a mallet for staking things in the ground.

21. Do not forget your chairs. Bring one extra for the one that will break. 

22. Have a safe to lock valuables up

**Clothing**

19. Footwear is important. Do not rely on flipflops. In fact

20. You know to bring cool stuff

21. Underwear

22. Bring a bandana! Or a hat. Or both...

23. Sunglasses are also a good idea...

**First-Aid/Health Items**

1. Sunscreen. Use this excessively. Bring extra.

2. Any toiletries you want to use or normally use. 

3. A tub to soak your feet in with some epson salt may help reduce soreness and increase stamina for the next day.

4. Alcohol Wipes are a good idea. Sanitize your privates

5. Babypowder for your thighs. Chafing may attack at anytime. And remember

**Misc

1. Have a headlamp.

2. Beware of cops on the way down and the way home. The closer you are to Bonnaroo

3. Fill your tank within 20 miles of Bonnaroo. You need the gas for waiting in the line

4. Facing the main stage

5. Cinema tent = Air conditioning and some unexpectedly good flicks 

6. Know how badly you want to see comedians. The line can get pretty long because so many people want to go. Last year Aziz was worth it. It all depends on your interests

7. Check out new things. New people, new food, new anything. Bonnaroo as so much to offer. Experience as much as possible.

8. Bring extra toilet paper.

9. Go to the bathroom at the gas station you stop at before going in. You will wait in line. 

10. Have extra lighters.

11. Don't think Thursday and Sunday aren't worth it. Come as early as you can

12. Bring toys, a deck of cards, a frisbee, etc...

13. Explore! This lets you find new things and get better acquainted with Bonnaroo. The more you explore

14. There are other entrances besides the main gate. If the line is really long

15. Hug the people in the free hug shirts.

16. If there is any chance you may try a drug for the first time (be realistic with yourself going in) then read up on it before hand. Know what you are getting into and don't freak out.

17. Share with your neighbors. 

18. Ask and you shall receive. ",self,t5_2rg7a,1361548428.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/1905wc/here_they_are_50_bonnaroo_pro_tips_for_your_added/

I got to the gate and my car randomly selected for search by the state troopers. My heart sank. My license was suspended at the time for unpaid traffic tickets. Thankfully I had no drugs on me. My only passenger was a 16 year old kid I was ""keeping an eye on"" for his parents benefit.

One of the troopers asked for my ID I gave him my passport card. Its the only ID I have since my license was confiscated. The trooper got angry and demanded to see my drivers license. I told him I didn't have it and he asked if it was suspended or revoked. I was honest and said it was suspended and gave him the Number to run it.(cops usually appreciate it if you have the License number memorized if you don't have it

Another trooper was searching my car and found a shit ton of alcohol. Two handles of Vodka and to 24 packs of beer. he came up to me and said

The trooper running my ID came back, all troopers ain't as nice as me."" then he drew a star on my windshield and we got back in line. 

I get to the campsite and we start unloading the car. I open the trunk and right on top is all my beer and Vodka! At some point one of the troopers must have sneakily put it back into my car! Those troopers were awesome.

This year though....was so different. I have never felt so welcomed and loved by everyone around me. 

Were there any special moments to you this year caused by the environment and people around you?

I found a purse during Radiohead. There didn't seem to be anyone around me whatsoever so it would have been easy to just take it

I would have felt too bad though. I had nothing but love for me in my heart from how amazing and welcoming everyone was all festival long. Instead, cards, a really nice phone, and so on. 

I thought about taking everything for myself, not taking anything, but keeping the bubbles. I had this long plan to take the purse home with me, find the owner on facebook since they had an ID inside, and mailing it to them.

Let's face it: the lost-and-found at the festival isn't that great. I had little-to-no hopes of the owner ever getting her shit back through it. 

I took out the bubbles and started blowing them hoping someone around me would be like ""shit man

1371704122.0,1gpj9o,My First Bonnaroo Experience (and Thank You to Sir Paul McCartney),norrel,37,2,14,"Going into Bonnaroo, and on top of that, that I witnessed Paul McCartney's set that everything changed for me

&gt; Before I go any further, a Vietnam war vet who was a strictly country music person, and my great-grandmother, who probably to this day doesn't know who The Beatles are. My parents themselves are not big Beatles listeners either, so long story short, I just never had an outlet or connection to them like most people probably had growing up, so I never had the chance to become a fan.

&gt;In fact, was my first time hearing a lot of Beatles songs, specifically *Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da*, *Blackbird*, *All Together Now*, and of course first time hearing Paul's Wings and solo stuff like *Here Today*. 


Before Paul's set, and just so happy to be around so many beautiful, happy people. A really nice girl I met looked at my face and told me I was crying, and I replied ""I am?"", and lo and behold, I check and I'm actually crying tears. I was crying because I was so happy. She was nice enough to wipe my tears away for me.


Now, and listening to every word Paul was singing. ""You were only waiting for this moment to be free"" was what really hit me, and I could just feel all the sadness and weight I had been carrying(pun very intended) over me for the past year just evaporate. When he followed up with ""Here Today"", and started talking about John, I already knew what kind of song it would be. The entire time, I just thought of my Aunt Lynn, and all the things I wished I would have said to her


""Live and Let Die"" was the moment where I felt like an entirely new person. I finally felt free, but only because I just could not comprehend that I was actually at Bonnaroo after SO many years of wanting to go ever since I was in high school, and actually seeing Bjork and St. Vincent, two people I thought I'd never really get to see. 


I had an amazing first Bonnaroo. I don't want to know where I would be right now if I had not went

**Getting there**

There are tens of thousands of people attempting to get in to the farm at the same time. There are lines, but bring a map or GPS of the area. It will greatly help with confusion.

**Lines and Car Checks** 

Again, there are car searches. These greatly vary in intensity though. The vast, vast majority of the searches are conducted by Bonnaroo volunteers. If you know the rules going in, know how much alcohol you are allowed to have, know not to have glass bottles, and more obvious rules, you likely can get through with little to no trouble at all. Again, and not very invasive

There are random searches done by state cops. These are VERY invasive. You don't want this done, maybe even less. There are no official figures on this that I know of. 

I know many of you are wondering, not being permitted into Bonnaroo, and possibly even worse punishments. It depends on what you have and how much. Anything you want will be inside. People get it in and if you ask fellow Rooers, most will at least point you in the right direction. That being said, it is possible. This point is up to you. I'll repeat, know the risks, plan accordingly.

**Once You're In**

If you are General Admission, and a canopy. Thats really it, unless you get lucky. Don't expect sprawling amounts of space. You'll be right up against other Rooers, but don't worry, everyone is friendly. 

Other options are group camping, except tent city. Tent City is an area very close to Centeroo where you can camp, but only with your tent. You park your car and take your gear down, expect a hike...

**Now What?**

These are the best tips I can give you regarding once you are in the farm:

1. **Know where your spot is.** Triangulate with 'landmarks' around your area

2. You may have heard

3. **You can't really sleep in**. When the sun comes up

4. You need **water!** Lots and lots of water. Be safe. Get a 24 pack of bottles per person. Who cares if you don't drink it all, monitoring intake, and not having to carry lots of bottles around.

5. Also, or just eat quick. Clifbars are great, healthy, give you energy, and easy to grab and go, or pack and eat later. I always take a grill and pack a cooler with food to cook. I'm the one relaxing with a full, delicious meal while the others don't eat so they can save money for later...

6. Related to food, and sometimes you can't walk anymore to get to one. Oh, and it can't hurt to take some **extra toilet paper** with you. Keep it at your camp, and late at night if you have to go, take it with you. That way if the johns near you are out, you can use them while everyone else goes searching.

7. There are lots of vendors throughout the camping area and Centeroo. You can get all sorts of cool things, lots and lots of pipes. Cheaper than you'll find anywhere else, too. 

8. **Sunscreen.** Don't be that guy that turns into a strawberry. The sun can ruin your time very quickly. Take precautions.

9. If you find a section of time with no acts you want to see

10. **Expand your horizons.** Bonnaroo has a lot to offer. Check out performers you don't know

**What To Bring**
* Tent
* Tarps
* Canopy (optional)
* Air Mattress (optional)
* Coolers
* Water
* Food and Quick Snacks
* Pots
* Camelback
* Backpack
* Extra Underwear
* Babypowder for possible chafing
* Bandaids for foot blisters
* Extra shoes
* Cool Clothes
* Spray bottles (spray yourself to cool down)
* Camera
* Map
* Sunglasses
* Hat
* Sunscreen
* Extra key for car to hide
* Flag (for above tent for easy location)
* Toilet Paper
* Lawn chairs and a folding table
* Small safe for hiding valuables in car
* A belt

One last thing: **on the way home

The guy I'm with held onto it, and not going to lie, made me feel uneasy. He then decided we weren't going to smoke any of it and sneak everything in. Well, it was going smoothly until he was speeding right past Memphis. We got pulled over, they say if it's personal we'd just step on it and go. Guys still said no, and for some reason the cop likes my 'honesty' even after the fact, we get in line for Roo at about 2

I own a screenprinting shop and was planning on printing some t-shirts for Bonnaroo to give away to new neighbors I meet. But I was curious if anyone going to 2013 want a limited press bonnaroo/ redditor shirt? I'll deliver at show.

I was thinking preorders as well as a possible meet as greet to get rid of the rest. I am also down to do group camp shirts or any other idea for the Fest!

Edit: I will be posting the design and an online order at Electroganic.bigcartel.com ASAP

If anyone has any ideas please post them!

From reading everyone's comments so far
Bonnaroo is a happy place, those hardships are so far away and insignificant it's like they do not even exist. You're in a place where everyone is essentialy your best friend for a few days. I remember going and befriending so many people, it almost overwhelmed me. Of course, I don't remember everyone's name, but coming from Bonnaroo, I sort of expect a certain camaraderie when going back. There is no slanderous gossip, heart wrenching lies, but in the end, we are all the same outcasts and misfits who walk around in barely any clothing... and no one cares.

The highway patrol targets cars with out of state tags every year before Bonnaroo hoping to find drugs. They will use any excuse to pull you over. Then they will ask if they can search your car. Many people say yes and get caught with drugs. If you get caught for simple possession of marijuana they often will tell you, but in my county at least, the judge makes you come to court.

We get lots of calls from people

Anyway, worse than the employees at Pretzle Maker. If you bumped elbows with someone and said, ""oops sorry"" they were more likely to say, ""What the fuck?"" than ""You're fine"".

Maybe I sound ridiculous, I rest my hand on the bar because obviously my feet were starting to hurt. This middle aged couple freaks out and the guy tries to pry my hand from the bar. Then the woman bangs her elbow down on my fingers to try to get me to move. I said, ""I'm not taking your spot, my feet are just tired."" and the woman procedes to say, ""I ain't got no bar to give up."" and squeezes as close as possible to the guy next to her whom she didn't even know and then tells him about how terrible I am and how long she's been waiting there.

So the year is 2011 and it's my first trip to the Roo. My group is 3 cars deep and we are all waiting in line to get in at about 11 pm on Wednesday night. We'd been there since 7 and been moving very slowly since then. We are all stretching our legs and walking around on the side of the road for a bit when we see that cars start moving again. We all scramble for our cars and I jump in my buddy's 15 passenger, van that had all of the groceries we just bout at that Walmart that's close by. Keep in mind, it's only me and my buddy in the van. At the time, he was sporting a magnificent beard and long flowing hair. The dude looked just like Jerry Garcia. When we get to the front gate, a volunteer motions for us to pull over to the side where a state trooper was waiting.

The trooper tells us to get out of our vehicle. At this point I knew exactly what was happening. We got ""randomly picked"" to be searched for drugs. Now, the trooper kept berating my friend with questions about where the drugs were and telling him to give them up. The dog was barking and we could hear him going through the grocery bags. Finally, the dog and his handler come back around and say that they couldn't find anything. The trooper finally takes his eyes off of us for the first time and tells us to be on our way. We made it through the gate and joined up with our friends and had a great trip, but lesson learned.

We're just 12 days away from the best week of the year and I know everyone is extremely excited to make it down to the farm. Posts coming from the community have been extremely helpful not just to first timers

Lately the amount of drug talk on r/bonnaroo has been going up. I'm not here to harsh on anyone -- what you choose to do with your body is your right and I'll defend it to the end. However, and TAB playing at the Kennedy Center), other communities have cut down on the amount of talk about illicit things in order to protect the community and insure that people will still feel comfortable posting. Drug talk tends to reinforce some negative stereotypes about festival patrons that the majority of Roo'ers don't fit into, and I think it makes the community look bad. For reference, Inforoo and other forums have specifically banned it for reasons relating to the Bonnaroo name and AC/Superfly.

There are other communities where drug talk is allowed (see: r/trees, as a group, to take that on. However, most of people I know who do festivals don't want to be associated primarily with something so generally verboten. I'm opening this up (karma-free) to elicit a discussion about how everyone else feels about it. If you think its alright, say so. Don't like it? Speak up. But I think its something that the r/bonnaroo community needs to decide on. 

NOTE: I have spoken to the Mods about this already -- we agreed that this was the best forum/way to discuss.

I had lost all of my friends from my campsite early in the day so the walk back would have been pretty boring in any other circumstance
Moments after going under the arch I was greeted by four ladies dressed as topless fairies (just wearing wings and bottoms). They had escorted me to a ""cardbord stripclub?"" Then disappeared the sign read ""show dem titays"" Normally I don't just go to cardboard jankie strip clubs but It was destiny that had brought me this far.  After what I thought was thirty mins of watching two girls ""dry"" humping each other I decided I really needed to get back to my tent. I would have made it too if it wasn't for a group of three guys looking for a fourth player for a beer pong competition. We played until the sun came up (two games).
When I finally had reached my tent my buddies had me breakfast waiting
TLDR: Just go to Bonnaroo!

twas the eve before Bonnaroo
crunchy grooves were heard playing

Our wristbands were registered
with hopes of lines moving quickly

The stump of a pipe held tight by my teeth
the smoke it encircled my head like a wreath

with bandana over my face
i pulled up the Centeroo map using my Bonnaroo App

Then over on Shakedown there arose such a clatter
a Wook selling paper with a name: The Mad Hatter

Away to the Other Tent
though the search was ancillary

and there upon the What Stage arrose a psychedelic site
Thom Yorke wishing us a Happy Bonnaroo

Music festivals, I can rest easily for the next several months of my life knowing that somewhere out there, I touched someone's life; maybe through enhancing an experience they were having with their own consciousness with a friendly hug and a good ol' ""I love you"" or maybe just because I took the time to sit down and smoke a bowl with them to show that someone cared, it all means the world to me.

Luckily this year we will not be carrying ANY illegal contraband with us because a friend is meeting us out there with all the party favors already.

They've been around for a few years and most Canadians know of them.  They recently traveled through my city.  They sold out two nights at one of the clubs here.  At $30 tickets

I saw them last summer at a festival that was also in my city.  They pretty much rocked it and were a highlight for me.  They played at the same time as John Mellencamp.  I don't regret skipping Mellencamp. :)

I'll be at their show this year at Bonnaroo.  I imagine most other Canadians that are making the trip will also check them out.
