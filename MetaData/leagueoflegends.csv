1355097226.0,14kn0k,I don't want to receive honor anymore.,Damiascus,9197,6571,1585,"Before reading this

My client crashed midway through a game two days ago, I noticed that I had received an honor from that game, the ""honorable opponent"" one, to be exact.  I originally thought someone DDOS'd it, but the fact that I received honor from it was weird to me.  I couldn't really remember what that game was about, since it was so short, but luckily, despite it not showing up on my match history.

I played Nocturne jungle for that game, and I had a pretty standard build for about 15 minutes, which was a madred's razor, some boots, a vamp scepter and a few health pots up until the point that my client crashed.

Upon re-watching it, I saw that he simply had no name. Stranger yet, he was also a Nocturne player.  From the beginning, he sat still in his base.

I might as well describe to you what happened during the game.  We started out normally, with every player being in the 6-10 level range, save for the enemy Nocturne. It was at 15:13 when I used my ultimate to get what seemed to be an assured kill on the enemy Soraka.  This is when the game crashed...or when I thought it crashed.  My recorder thought otherwise.

In the replay, it was during this glitch that my client froze and closed on me. But in the replay, after the glitch, it showed us all still playing...this REALLY freaked me out, but I kept watching. Apparently, my ""character"" secured the kill on the Soraka, recalled and continued to jungle. That's when I read the eerie message... ""...has reconnected."" The no name jungler on the other team got back into the game somehow and started to jungle.  I felt uneasy watching him.

The other lanes kept at each other, the Ezreal, and it was the enemy Nocturne who killed him. He never respawned either. I froze in my chair, watching people die, one by one, each death leaving a lasting impression on me.

The Nocturne that I was ""supposedly"" playing did everything I would have done, to the point that I was gripping my desk.  I can't really explain why, but it's a nerve-racking feeling knowing that if your character died, they wouldn't come back... I kept telling myself it was a glitch, but after what happened next, I found it hard to.

There were only 3 people left. Me, a Diana. At this point, my eyes were glued to the screen, and I couldn't help but watch as my character pursued her. This was the death that disturbed me the most. My character ulted towards her, as I normally would have done, and met her at her wraith camp. Just as my character got there, I saw the enemy Nocturne standing still in the passage to their red buff...he just stood there and watched my Nocturne destroy the enemy Diana.

After her death

The minions didn't move, I checked my settings on the recording. The chat box was unchecked. I remember my fingers shaking a bit as I clicked to check it.

The no name jungler had been typing throughout the entire match after the apparent crash. All he said, ""KILL THEM ALL. KILL THEM ALL."" Up until I had killed Diana. I felt my heart sink when I read those words, decorated across my screen. What he said soon after was what sent chills throughout my entire body.

""Thank you for your assistance.""

And that's when the game ended. No nexus was destroyed, I found that none of them played another game after that one. I'm still checking every few minutes, hoping that one of them will get in a game soon.  I don't really know what happened to those people, and I don't think I want to know...

I have since deleted the recording from my computer.  I don't want anything to do with that replay...

I just recently posted the 40-0 akali bronze game and somehow it hit frontpage. I wasn't expecting it to get much attention and it was never meant to be hurting anyone or making people feeling bad. My only intention was really to show some tips for my ~50viewers I had that day. I am not an experienced steamer yet and also english is not my native language so I am sorry if some people felt like I was just trying to stomp bronze players and ""brag"" about it. I just uploaded the video because I was just like well 40-0 sounds fun. Didn't have much other intentions.
So I am sorry if I made some people feel bad but I just tried to be informative for people that want to learn about LoL.

1360666852.0,18dekb,How Riot and ESL are not paying tournament prizes.,snip3y,6992,4739,769,"I'll try to be as short as possible

I'm Snipey and I belong to Team Synthesis

We've been playing go4lols and as everyone knows Riot sponsors tournaments with RP prizes. Normally what you get is 5€ in RP for 4th place, the same system applies to the stuff I'll be talking about.    

Our achievements:

* 3rd place at go4lol #119
* 1st place at go4lol #122
* 1st place at go4lol #123
* 2nd place at go4lol monthly finals december
* 4th place at Slap.dk Roccat Challenge
* 2nd place at eSportsHeaven Roccat Challenge


A grand total of 85€ in RP (PER MEMBER!)

Not to mention ESL owes us 500€ (for the team) in cash money for 1st places at go4lols (200€+300€

The sad part is we're not the only one, this is more than most people earn in 1 or maybe even 2 months.    

My rough estimate is that this goes back up to 6 months, but others say that it's been over 7 and they still didn't get it. Patience doesn't pay off if we just sit and do nothing.    

I've reopened ESL support ticket 6 times and only got 3 answers (+2 tickets for cash prize), who then sent me to ""tournaments@riotgames.com"", I've sent 2 emails there and got no answer, went back to Riot support who told me they have nothing to do with this and that I should talk to ESL (that was the second time I was talking to Riot), then ESL told me that we should wait a couple of weeks to get our prizes and nothing has happened for over 3 weeks again. There were 5 questions and 5 replies from Riot to support tickets, but the problem is it was coming from different people. ESL and Riot were just trying to get rid of me and tell me to go to the other guy, they had a ping pong match and I was the ball.    

I don't know who is incompetent here ESL or Riot

**tl;dr ESL owes 1k € in cash money and Riot owes a bit under 1k € in RP to players of just two teams.**

EDIT: Thank you all for your support and upvotes
EDIT: Oh yeah
EDIT: I can't even count the amount of posts from people who are saying that they have the same problem! DO SOMETHING!

EDIT: For the ones who are saying that ESL hasn't posted the results to Riot, proving that we've won prizes for these tournaments and as I've said the e-mail hasn't been answered (that's where support first sent me to) and after I asked support what's happening again, they've told me to go back to ESL, eventho they could clearly see which team and which players are supposed to get the RP. Riot is ignoring us too.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is my proposition:

http://img534.imageshack.us/img534/4117/v1ed.jpg

(fake case)


**My 3 main ideas :**

1/ Get rid of the Pardon/Punish buttons

2/ Add the Champion-Selection-chat and the After-Game-chat

3/ Give the possibilty for judges to highlight sentences in the chat

-------------------------------------------------------------------


**1/ Get rid of the Pardon/Punish buttons**

All players reported in the tribunal have not the same level of toxicity. While some are just reported for saying 'easy'
When I am reviewing cases it just makes me feel bad to click the same button for these two kinds of players.


The Solution:

Replace the 2options buttons (Pardon/Punish) by a 'Ladder of Toxicity'. 

The judges don't choose to punish or pardon the player but indicate on a ladder from 1 to 5 the toxicity of the player

1 : no reason to punish

2 : small reason to punish

3 : good reason to punish

4 : really toxic player

5 : EVIL SATAN TEEMO



In this way: Judges would feel more comfortable in their decisions. There is no more Good or Bad Decision for the judges
More other


**2/ Add the Champion-Selection-chat and the After-Game-chat**

This is something frequently asked for the Tribunal.

In several reported-games you can read in the commentaries of reporters 'insult in after-game-chat' but the Guidelines of the Tribunal are clear: 'All summoners are innocent until proven guilty.'
Adding the after-game-chat would diminish the toxicity of player after the games.


**3/ Give the possibility for judges to highlight evidences**

Reviewing case is a hard work and takes time and concentration.

A judge reading the chatlog looks for evidence to place the player on the ladder of toxicity. But reviewing 20 cases means to read 100 chatlogs


We could make a system in which

Once a sentence has been highlighted by a Judge it is visible in red by the other judges that are reviewing the same case. 

The attention of each one benefits to everyone.

(look the example in the drawing at the top of the post)



Here are my propositions

Thx

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**TLDR;** Tribunal could benefit from some changes: replace the Pardon/Punish buttons by a Ladder of toxicity – add the after-game-chat –and judges could highlight evidences in chatlog.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**Edit:** Frontpage =) - In response to comments:

- To avoid ""highlight pollution"" there would be a limit of 1highlight per case per judge. And to appear in red sentences need to be highlighted by several judges

- ""*Highlight would influence other judges*""


**Edit2:** Glad to see I introduce a good debate. The tribunal is a good thing. I remind you I only suggest ideas to make it better again. I did expect down-votes as it is a hard question and only small ideas,False,self,t5_2rfxx,1373294651.0,,thresh,t3_1huyc8

This was when I realized what I had to do.

It all seemed to happen in slow motion, turned around, and charged back at the enemy team. he took a swipe at their carry, let out a howl, and fell.

I’ve been playing League of Legends for about 3 years now. I’ve been sitting at almost **exactly** 1200 elo for that whole time (Silver V 4 life!). So

I’m also an entrepreneur. A while back, but they want us to prove people are interested before forking over the money to develop it. 

So

*****

##The Idea
**In a nutshell:** Voice chat that works *inside* your browser and lets you invite people simply by sharing a URL. No downloads or any other BS. 

Here are the essentials in case you’re not into scrolling/reading. 

* **Our website:** http://ggnoob.net/ 
* **Our cheesy marketing video:** http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q-ZFXmfaTk 
* **A mock-up of what it would look like in action:** http://imgur.com/lCjMx0w 
* **Here’s where you can sign up (this helps us with investors the most):** https://confirmsubscription.com/h/i/FA5207DE3A26A4A7  


Gamers need to chat. But most voice chat systems just kind of suck. You have to download a client. You have to buy a server (or know someone who has a server). You have to exchange account or server info. You have to set up your audio. Blah blah blah. They are just a complicated

But the biggest drawback of these platforms is that you need to know people beforehand. That’s a huge problem for League of Legends. You don’t want to give some random bloke your server information or your Skype name in champion select. 

We figured it was time for something 100x easier

* Log into GGNoob
* Click one button to create a temporary room
* Share the URL (in champion select or wherever)
* Whoever clicks the URL is taken your room and is able to chat

That’s it. It’s the easiest possible process we could think of. The idea is loosely based on the now-defunct [PentaCall]( http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/13vupg/easy_web_based_team_voice_chat/). PentaCall was an awesome idea, it was run by one guy (who seemed to quickly ran out of money to fund it), and it could only be used with League of Legends.  

GGNoob solves these problems by creating an investor-backed

****
##Where we’re at now
At first

* **Problem 1:** It is extremely difficult to find someone to develop something like GGNoob without hiring a big agency. We went through 4-5 independent developers before realizing that they just didn’t have the resources (or time) to do it. We needed a bigger team. 

* **Problem 2:** Any time you host thousands of people on a single website, you need a Flash server. On average, that costs about $200/mo per 200 users. Obviously, we imagine having a couple thousand users. If that was the case, Flash server hosting would cost us a **several thousand dollars per month.** And we just don’t have the budget for that yet. 


*****
## The Business Model

Obviously, similar to Twitch.tv or League of Legends itself. 

* You'll be able to use 90% of the service for free

* You'll have the option to upgrade for $7/mo or whatever

* No ads! We think ads hurt the user experience

* We're not sure what the upgrade features will be yet, and extra big rooms (for bigger MMO clan-type stuff, etc.)

Earlier this year I went through a heartbreaking divorce and my ex wife took my daughter out of state.
While we still lived in the same house my 2 year old daughter would sit in my lap while I played (and yeah I occasionally ate a ban warning because dirty diapers were more important than helping my ADC gather CS).

She loved watching me play and occasionally slammed the keyboard to ""help""...which often landed me right into a gray screen. I didn't mind
She even wanted to be Annie for Halloween and I was going to be Tibbers. But due to the divorce that never transpired.

Fast forward to this thanksgiving, spongebob, and other 'little girl' things.

Now he goes everywhere with her; to the bath, etc. she calls him ""daddy's Rammus"" says ""rawr...OK"" when I ask what sound he makes, throws him across the room yelling ""powball!"", and will surely perplex and annoy her mom when she goes back to her.
I want to say thank you not only for a great game I thoroughly enjoy

Now daddy and Daddy's Rammus can keep my little girl safe from counter ganks.

Thank you Riot and happy holidays r/leagueoflegends! I look forward to lurking you all more for season 3!

1370477588.0,1fra6p,"True ""mage"" AP mids really need to be looked at.",Washbag,5065,3151,1861,"Hi all

I'm a D3 plat mid laner.  I'm by no means the best

I wanted to talk a bit about the archetypal ""mage"" type champions - full ap champs that are squishy

* Veigar
* Cassiopeia (had to look up the spelling on that one)
* Annie
* Brand
* Viktor
* Malzahar
* Syndra
* Zyra
* Xerath
* Lux

There might be some debate as to other champs that might fit this category

Out of the champions listed, I really think the problem is bigger than that.

----------------------

There are four major problems that I see:

**1) Raw AP itemization sucks**

* Every champion on that list has mana issues, or catalyst.  All these items mean is you just spent 700-1200 gold in order to be able to play your champion satisfactorily while bruisers, ad's, and assassins don't have to worry at all.  None of those items contribute to what you do best - mid-game bursting.  A Diana can focus on building a mid-game Abyssal Scepter while you are trying to finish your ROA that won't be fully charged for another 10 minutes.  A mid lane Zed can get a brutalizer while you are stuck building mana/seeker's armguard.

* Defensive itemization is bad.  If an ad champ is having trouble vs AP then he builds a 1400 gold hexdrinker.  Bam - immediate mr, Kassadin, Elise, etc.) is having trouble vs AP then he builds Abyssal.  Also, both of these groups can just get an MR item, such as a negatron, and will not sacrifice much damage and can later build that item into something useful.  If a pure AP caster is having trouble against either of these people then his/her options are very limited.  For armor you have to build seekers and then WAIT for it to give you stats.  I don't know why the fuck they decided that was a good idea. ""This Zed is blowing me up

* Late game damage is subpar compared to AD carries/bruisers

* You're stuck with Sorc Shoes 95% of the time

**2) Lots of champions can counter you in midlane.  You counter almost no one.**

When was the last time you heard someone say ""Shit

The fact of the matter is that these AP mids are not tailor made to counter any other champion.  Even Veigar

**3) These champions are restricted to mid lane**

None of these champions can go full AP carry anywhere other than mid lane.  Lee Sin can play jungle, Diana, Vlad, etc etc.  It's a disadvantage for picks/bans because once you pick Annie the other team knows for a fact what is going mid and what is going top.  It's also indicative of a problem if an entire class of champions will get eaten alive by pretty much any top laner in the other solo lane.

**4) Mobility creep left us behind**

Most top laners/junglers have a way to reach the back line.  This means that by the time you get your full combo off you are usually dead as shit.  It's not very rewarding to have to blow your load as Malzahar on one champion and then die shortly thereafter during every single fight.

Maybe this is an issue with itemization or base stats

I know the Riot design team's been working hard this year. Much too hard to even consider implementing anything like the snow-based holiday map from last year.

And don't get me wrong, and artwork. 

But I don't think I'm alone in wishing that Riot would do SOMETHING - just a LITTLE something for the holidays.

Therefore, you bring back the Santa hat on Baron. That's all. No complicated christmas-y effects or snowfall, no blinding-white snow textures that bother half the playerbase. It would literally be less than 10 minutes of work for one of the developers, and a 30-second patch. Just a hat.

Riot plz.

If people agree

Happy holidays everyone!

Here is a short and very crude animation of how it sort of works:

http://i.imgur.com/z4hCyUd.gif

Sorry

I'm sure you're all aware of how each camera mode works, that surrounds your character. You can move your mouse cursor like you would in free cam to see other parts of the map. However, this 'barrier' prevents the camera from going a certain distance from him/her so that he/she is always on screen. But, when you click to move around the camera follows your character around the screen like it would in locked cam, the only difference is you are not in the centre of the screen.

I feel this would be a big help for people on purple who want to extend their view down towards blue's side and it will help people to remain aware of where their character is at all times.

So

Edit 1: Wow, it isn't supposed to be better than free cam. It may have some slight issues and bugs to work out, if it were actually implemented into the game. This would be just another option for people who want to have a locked cam, but want a little more map awareness. And yes, I now know that Bloodline Champions has a similar feature. Anyway, thanks :D

1373233824.0,1htoaa,A Warning to New LCS teams and rising Amateur teams,MegaZeroLoL,5789,3950,1254,"As many of you know, managers have a tremendous amount of power over the players and before you hire a manager

I've always believed that the majority of the team should have power (3/5 members), all roster swaps, and he pretty much owns the team and can sell it to anyone he deems necessary. In my case, our manager decided to pay himself over 3x that of our highest paid player. Now there are some contractual rules that are there to help the players, but I'm not positive if I'm allowed to get into them. Riot has been helping out our team and trying to sort out the situation, but we still haven't received any of the 'stolen' money. I do take full responsibility for letting this situation happen, it was all just very unfortunate because at the time

Now that was just a personal scenario from being in the LCS, this is perfectly legal and it's due to the fact that managers have complete control over a team. This seems like a major flaw in eSports, especially at its current stage. Most of the players are very young and trust people blindly. They don't take managers seriously and usually just hire a friend or a popular player. I'm not saying every team does this, but because the manager role isn't like a real sport yet, you put these young players in a situation where their career can be totally ruined just because there's someone that controls their fate.

I have a couple of ideas to help improve the situation and I think the easiest thing would just be give power to the majority in the team (however I'm sure the community can come up with better ideas so feel free to comment!) Another idea was to have a background check/interivew by Riot before someone is eligible to become manager. Being a manager of a professional team is a job

1376256243.0,1k5yje,Fiora's R is hideously broken.,excusemewtf,4426,2585,988,"**EDIT:** I did not mean ""broken"" as in overpowered. I meant broken as in it is not a skill that functions in any logical way. Please read what is written below before shooting off some reply about how it is or isn't overpowered - I didn't mean unbalanced

I honestly don't know if a single skill more broken than Fiora's R. The way it works mechanically is seriously ridiculous. Allow me to explain.

Fiora's R is a series of 5 attacks with bonus damage. The first one on each target deals a very high amount with any that follow dealing 25% of that. They apply on hit effects and Hydra will splash them (meaning that Hydra + Black Cleaver on Fiora makes her R an AoE armor debuff) but her ultimate has some tremendous downfalls

Here's a short list of things that ruin Fiora's ult - I could list more

Jax's E completely negates the damage. For the whole ult
Pantheon's passive blocks a hit. If it's the first hit
Blinds cause it to miss.

All of that is fine - a solid Fiora player can play around all of it, knock off Pantheon's shield, whatever. But there is another really dumb aspect of this skill that requires a bit of explanation first.

Each hit of Fiora's R has 3 parts. The first is a teleport. The second is a ""check."" The third is a hit. Despite what the description suggests you are not untargettable for the check phase - you can be hit with skills and die. Basically, then you hit them. Then this repeats for the next hit (which will target a different champion if it can.)

Once you're in your ult

If at any point a target becomes invulnerable, it will stop and no more of her attacks will resolve. Zhonya's cancels her ult immediately, along with things like Yi's Q, or STEPPING INTO A BRUSH WITH THE RIGHT TIMING. And there is nothing Fiora can do about this except make sure she never ever uses her R in the presence of someone with Zhonya's, an untarget-status ability, or a bush anywhere within flash range. Basically Fiora's only answer is to not ult at all ever.

[Here](http://www.twitch.tv/excuseslol/c/2734132) is an example showing Yi fizzling Fiora's ult on the 2nd hit. Costing a kill on Darius (and likely Yi too) if only because she doesn't end her ultimate on Darius like she should have

tl;dr riot pls Fiora's R is the worst skill mechanically in the game (except maybe rocket jump) and has been like this since the day she was released. It's her ULTIMATE. One of the primary reasons she is a weak character (besides lol meleeadc)

**EDIT #2:** Sheesh

**EDIT #3:** Fiora players rejoice - Riot has heard and RiotVolty has confirmed he is making her R a priority.

&gt;***""2? or 1?""***

*""How much money do you have?""*

&gt;***""400.""***

*""Get two.""*

----------------------------------------------------
At this point, stuck with Doomy, the intensely persistent troll Nasus.

A level 1 team fight breaks out

Trist types: *""Nasus come mid""*

&gt;***""i am mid? not bot?""***

*""Just for now!""* 

I give up first blood

-------------------------------------------------------------
We come out of the skirmish 2 to 2

*""Play defensive.""*

&gt;***""should i hit mans?""***

A couple seconds later

I am in stitches at this point

Again he asks:

&gt;***""hit mans? or no?""***

*""huh? go ward""*

&gt;***""like this?""***

It hits me and I realize

-------------------

At about 6:30 minutes in

&gt;***""sry. not strong""***

*""Its okay

At about this point, calms him down and tells him to focus on late game.

------------------

At about 9:00 in

*""hey doomy. where are you from?""*

&gt;***""?? jp""***

*""japan? woah""*

&gt;***""ya""***

*""why play on NA servers?""*

&gt;***""better player""***

*""i thought asians were supposed to be super good at this game o.o""*

&gt;***""korea""***

Now I can't tell if this guy is going super troll mode

-----------------------------------------------
At about 13:00

*""yeah

Then I see the Nasus walk by, **'An Enemy Has Been Slain'**. I look up and Doomy is dangerously low.

Olaf says: *""sorry buddy

&gt;***""it ok. i alive.""***

---------------------------------------------------------

At 17:30, but they're both getting dangerously low. 

Trist jumps in at the last second

&gt;***""GJ TRISTANA""***

*""Im sorry D: no mana!""*

&gt;***""it ok""*** 

-----------------------------------

At about 19:00 our Olaf dives a tier 2 tower for a kill on the enemy top laner, out of mana. He runs, spending Ragnarok and Ghost running, baiting them right into the rest of us, we grab three kills. We chase the enemy Kassadin down to mid but he escapes with a sliver of health.

Doomy runs in out of nowhere, and then nonchalantly dodges the ult arrow from the just-spawned top lane Ashe (I don't even know) and tanks the second tower, strolling back to safety, no fucks given.

&gt;***""[All] Doomy: BIG DOG""***

---------------------------

25:00 in, headed straight for Trist who is out of position. Doomy flashes in, taking the arrow and subsequent Sona ult, allowing the rest of us to focus down their carries one by one, chasing them back, and taking the two mid towers in the process.

We attempt to take inhib tower, willing to come back for the tower another time. But Doomy, with no fucks left since team select, stays the extra millisecond to take the tower down. As a result, the enemy Mundo and Sona, fully refreshed, are on him

As my team attempts to flee and kite them away from Doomy, peeling their team away from us so that we can escape.

I run alongside him, and he is too low. Doomy falls, martyred for the team and an inhibitor tower. 

*""im sorry doomy D:""*

&gt;***""it ok***

&gt;***team live***

&gt;***dog die""***

Manly tears were shed.

------------------------------

Afterwards we push for the win
In the post-game lobby

This was his first.

**Doomy's Profile:** http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/12041#profile

Apologies for the low resolution. I'm going to start streaming soon so I'm mostly testing settings right now and did not intend for this replay to be public. But subscribe if you like! (pls :D) Should be more LoL-based hilarity up soon.

EDIT: Wow I really did not expect so many people to be bothered to watch the video! Thank you so much! And again, you should at least catch the team fight at the 25:00 mark. That's the big line and martyr moment. Tried to capture the feeling in text but there's nothing like watching it happen.

1373751626.0,1i8mhp,Hecarim is the Ruined King of the Shadow Isles,VegaD,4587,2775,575,"**Hecarim is the Ruined King of the Shadow Isles brought back to life by Karthus to kill the only person opposing the higher power in the Shadow Isles

We already know that the Shadow Isles were once a thriving kingdom that fell when the king's daughter died, there are only a few ways left that Mordekaiser could have betrayed the king. Either he killed the king himself, or he did something behind the curtains that helped the kingdom fall and become cursed. If it was the first one, why would the altar warn hecarim about Mordekaiser? He would know what Mordekaiser did. We also know that Mordekaiser's armor and undead status are a punishment or curse, that he seeks to get rid of for some reason. 

**When you really think about it, cause an entire kingdom to fall, and become the cursed land of the dead?**

So, **Karthus enters the Shadow Isles, accepts undeath, and becomes a sort of god of the place with the ""*Keys to life and death*""**. But wait, why a couple centuries? The events of the current Shadow Isles have actually taken a very long time to flesh out. **Sometime between their creation and now, the beings Thresh(The soul collector) and Yorick(The gravedigger aka body collector) came into existence, and Yorick's lore states that he's been digging in servitude to the Isles for centuries.**

The fact that they came to existence in the Isles through dying serves as proof to what Elise says about the Isles being death's gate. *""That was when I understood that death was another world and I was at its door.""*

Hecarim's creation was shortly after Karthus gained his powers. The soul of the king was floating around the Isles along with all of the other souls kingdom's residents.*Off tangent here, and it is now Elise's job to offer souls in masses to try and strengthen it*.

Many quotes and lore lines support Hecarim being the reincarnated king:
""Remember who you once were
""Mordekaiser is not to be trusted
""others still believed him to be the creation of some hateful necromancer."" - Straight from the horse's lore. Some hateful necromancer sounds exactly like a guy that hates the living and has the keys to life and death themselves.

Lemme know what you guys think :D 

**Tl;Dr** No

**Obligatory front page edit: Thanks so much for the upvotes guys :D are lore investigations something you all would like to see more of in the future? I absolutely loved doing this**

**Important Edit: I've decided to post smaller tidbits, and will post to both regularly.

1364486690.0,1b6lxe,Some useful LoL websites that EVERYONE should know about,cable729,3410,1606,474,"###Personal Stats (Summoner Information)

* **[Quickfind](http://quickfind.kassad.in/)** - Gives you all the quick information you want to know about your summoner. When it was created

* **[LoL Summoners](http://www.lolsummoners.com/)** - You remember how Riot took down the ladders? Well these guys put it back up! It may not always be up-to-date

* **[LoL Team](http://www.lolteam.net)** - Ever wonder if you should be scared of that enemy Shaco? Well pull up this site and type in your name and you can see how many games everyone's played of that character, and more.

* **[LoL Nexus](http://lolnexus.com/)** - Similar to LoL Team

* **[Pro Builds](http://www.probuilds.net/)** - This is a really cool site where you can see what builds the pros are using **right now**. You get to see their item order, gold, team, runes, masteries, and even a picture of the pro! All this in a nice-looking site that is super polished.

* **[Spectate Us](http://spectate.us)** - Type in a summoner name and select a region. If that person is playing a match right now

* **[LolKing](http://www.lolking.net/)** - LolKing has been the place to go for stats for a long time

* **[Elophant](http://www.elophant.com/)** - Elophant recently got a full makeover. ~~They used to be a pay-only service that all the pros used

* **[Elobuff](https://elobuff.com/landing)** - Powerful statistics. This is a pay-site as opposed to LolKing and Elophant.

###News/Pro Scene

* **[Lolplay (League Vods)](http://lolplay.tv/)** - Missed the LCS last weekend? No problem, first blood, or whenever you want. They also have tournaments that aren't LCS.

* **[Riot Esports](http://na.lolesports.com/)** - They have a great site with a lot of information. They have articles on past games, interviews, you name it. If you love professional esports, this is the place to go.

* **[Esports Calendar](http://esportcalendar.com/)** - Contains all the up-and-coming tournaments. Times, games, etc.

* **[Surrender at 20](http://www.surrenderat20.net/)** - Do you remember [MMO Champion](http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/) from WoW? This is basically the same thing. News aggregator, and more.

* **[Reign of Gaming](http://www.reignofgaming.net/)** - Pretty similar to SurrenderAt20. They also aggregate news, including solo, competitive, jungle, threes, and dominion.

* **[In2LoL](http://www.in2lol.com/en/start)** - This looks like a news site that's more focused on the Pro scene. They also aggregate Vods and Livestreams. There's a calendar on the right counting down to the next games too

* **[LoL Portal](http://www.lolportal.net/)** - Another news site

### Guides and League Information

* **[Solomid](http://www.solomid.net/)** - My favorite place to go for guides. Their guides seem to be more detailed that Lolpro and cleaner in general. My only complaint is that they play a 30 second video ad at the top of the page. However

* **[LolPro](http://www.lolpro.com/)** - Where TSM Snapdragon has solomid.net

* **[Mobafire](http://www.mobafire.com/)** - A highly controversial guide site. It's a great resource for newer players

* **[League Wikia](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/League_of_Legends_Wiki)** - A wiki specifically made for League of Legends. This is the one I use.

* **[Leagueapedia](http://leaguepedia.com/wiki/League_of_Legends_Wiki)** - Another wiki option. They specialize in documenting the pro scene.

* **[Is LoL up?](http://islolup.com/)** - Tells you if the servers are up.

### Other Stuff

* **[Leaguepedia Fantasy](http://www.leaguepediafantasy.com/)** - Are you a fan of fantasy baseball/football/etc.? Then surely you'll want to visit Leaguepedia Fantasy! I believe this is the only site to offer a LoL Fantasy experience.

The jist of it is that the game mode works very similarly to the current draft mode. The champion selection process will start each team will ban three champion. Champions will be selected in the same format 1-2-2-2-2-1. The major difference here is that as you are choosing a champion your icon doesn't light up with the champion you chose

* Episode 1 - First Blood (8:53)
* Episode 2 - Seoul Searching (12:09)
* Episode 3 - The ""CLG Curse"" (17:54)
* Episode 4 - A New Hope (11:56)

Originally envisioned as a story about CLG’s quest to win the Season 2 Championships

We have decided to distribute this film through a “pay what you want” model. CLG decided to finance the film ourselves in order to remove ourselves from the expectations or restrictions sourcing funding comes with. At the same time, so we feel it is important for anyone to be able to view this film if they are interested and unable to donate. There are many realities regarding teams, sponsors, leagues, and more which go completely unmentioned to the general public. CLG is just one story, and we wanted to give our fans and the community a better view behind the veil of eSports.

If you are able and choose to donate, filming and production wages). Additional revenue will be divided between CLG and its players, current and former (EG/CLG EU), to help recover the streaming revenue they lost due to own3D.tv’s collapse.

I’d like to thank everyone involved in the production of this film. On the behalf of everyone in CLG and Machinima VS

After calling the role already filled they refuse to communicate or compromise on what roles they would be willing to play. I then decide that rather than have a gimped team I will take one for the team of complete strangers and dodge the queue.

**AND THEN** the greatest injustice in the entire game is bestowed upon me: A queue dodging penalty of an entire hour. I just saved three people from playing with this moron who based on current observations would make a terrible team mate.

My suggestion would be this: When the notification shows up in the bottom right telling you who left your game. The four remaining team mates would vote on whether leaving the game was justified. If if three of the four say yes the leaver would serve no penalty And if half say yes they would serve a slightly reduced penalty.

This suggestion keeps with the ""For the players. By the players."" Philosophy of the Tribunal.

Once someone has your password that's it

Riot could save a **lot** of time and money in support tickets(the wait time is anywhere from 3d-1w) from stupid people like my self if they tighten up how easy it is to completely hijack an account.



A few things that other games/services do:

* Require email action on email change(this allows the original owner to always recover the account if their email isn't compromised)
* Require a small access code sent by email/SMS when a new location/computer is detected

* Additional layer of security in the form of secret question

**I wrote the following for our fans and my fans specifically as I feel I owe them an explanation.**

-----------
Some of you may have expected some form of statement from ourselves; while some may have feared it
*******
Over the past two years of being a team we have lived together in Korea, reaching 3rd/4th behind Azubu Frost &amp; TPA (*ps: still bitter about losing to Frost, we almost had them in OGN!*). While friendship is one of the core values of our team and our popularity in the community – we are at heart competitive players, and as any competitive player *(in any sport)*, we want to win. We don't play League of Legends 10 hours a day and think about it in our sleep, critiquing each other and ourselves as individuals because we want to participate – we do this because we want to win and unfortunately that is not the case right now.
*******
**“So what gives?”** - A good question, but it's not a simple fix and we have come to the point now where we are running out of time. We are currently bottom of the table and only a month away from play-offs which we won't even qualify for if we are not top 6, never mind making it to World Finals.
*****
We never really needed a manager, believe me.. I looked! After our weak performance in the opening of the second split, we witnessed considerable roster changes from other teams who were facing a lot of internal and external pressure at the time. Consequently, Christoph 'nRated' Seitz was released from Fnatic and while we found this surprising news, we saw this as an opportunity to pick up the analyst we always wanted. Not only is he a very capable player in terms of skill, he has a sharp mind when it comes to decision making in game and as he is a friend, we are able to respect his opinion and observations of our team both in and out of game.
*****
**""What role will nRated play in the team?""** He will play several roles
*****
Is it enough? Will it get us from the bottom of the table to the top? Obviously it's not the answer to all of our problems

**I've taken the decision to take a step back temporarily**. While my performance has been scrutinized, as a team we realize that we are running out of time, it's 4 weeks until play offs, we are not where we need to be and we cannot tolerate being anywhere else but Worlds. I don't know and we as a team don't know if substituting me will be beneficial, but we want to try it out now.. rather than later.. *(as we need results now)*.
****

**We depart for LCS Tenerife tomorrow**, we want to have them to actually utilize them actively.
****
Going forward, identifying strengths and weaknesses. The idea behind this is to improve our performance as a team, not to act as a threat to the starting line up *(even though this added pressure can result in people stepping up their game, which is a good thing!)*.
****
--------
**I'd like to thank the fans for their continued support and express that we do understand their frustration. I hope you understand my decision for doing this

Thanks to all our supporters and we hope we can do better in the LCS for all our fans! I'll likely be able to stream along with the rest of the team once we're situated in the house I'll do my best to create some very educational content!**

Hi reddit

I'm frommaplestreet, sometimes even a substantial lead, and then not being able to close out the game and eventually losing them. It was pretty rough, but we're confident we can shore up some of our weak points in the upcoming weeks and learn how to commandingly close out games. To do this, there a few things that we definitely need improvement on - communication and synergy being the main two.

In order to best work on our communication and synergy

Since the day after our qualification we've been actively seeking a place in southern California to live, slow realtors, lack of credit, lack of work history, stubborn owners have all substantially slowed down what should have been a relatively clean process. The problem seems to lie in a breakdown of communication between us, an agent, another agent, and the gist of our request isn't being properly communicated to owners. It's been incredibly frustrating and super time consuming. So we've decided to turn to reddit for help.

What we're looking for is a house that has most or all of the following features:

* 4 bedrooms (3 bedrooms would put us at more than 2 teammates/bedroom
* 3 bathrooms
* within ~50 miles or ~1h30m drive of Santa Monica 
* Access to extremely high-speed internet that would support 5 people streaming and playing constantly (Verizon FiOS
* willing to do a year or shorter lease
* **willing to work with 6 guys who have no work history

We are able and willing to work around price. We can pledge to be exceptionally clean. We won't throw parties. We won't be noisy. We just need to get everyone under one roof so we can take our play to the next level.

So then reddit

A few things that I don't think will be super helpful at this point: links to listings - we've explored zillow, craigslist, padmapper, etc etc etc and the problem lies in the lack of qualifications, not the lack of listings. Realtors that you know - again, realtors have been half of the problem, we need to go directly to homeowners and landlords who are sympathetic to our situation. Money - while we are very gracious to your donation, we've found several places well within our price range and are getting hung up on other parts of the process. Telling us to lie on the application - that's something we've ruled out as a team

Presently, the more we impose on our hosts, and the sadder we become. That's why we decided to see if any of you could help us expedite this process. Any of you willing to help us will have our eternal gratitude, and maybe we can see what we can do about repaying you in more tangible ways as well.

1350385487.0,11kcdl,"HUGE informational thread about JUNGLE CHANGES, SEASON 3 ITEM OVERHAUL,  SEASON 3 CHAMPION REMAKES, and SEASON 3 FEATURES.",MegaFoch,1749

The discussion about this all started with **Morello's** reply to a summoner's comments about the Jungle being too ""safe"" and the lack of being able to out farm an enemy jungler to gain some sort of advantage.



""Yes
------------------------------------------------------
""Jungle changes will have a big impact on single-target junglers especially.""


**Statikk** continued to expand on the jungle changes and revealed more details of what Riot is aiming for



""We've actually been working on changes for the jungle in anticipation for Season 3 and though I can't really give all the details here because we are still iterating

There are a multitude of issues we're tackling and they are very much intertwined. The current dominant jungle strategy (GP10 Support / Tanks) is fairly stagnant and the overall current jungle playstyle in many cases severely limits potential strategy and choices in other lanes/roles as well.

One large problem is that efficient farming of the jungle has very little pay off compared to constantly applying lane pressure by camping / ganking. Overall junglers severely lack in gold unless they successfully gank and snowball the game from the get-go and/or opt for a GP10 strategy.

The approach we're currently taking is to significantly increase the rewards of jungle camps over time (junglers already have a huge impact on the early game). To go along with this though

This is not the only thing we're changing in the jungle for next season




**Statikk's** response to a Summoner commenting that this is just Riot reverting the last set of jungle changes:


""In some ways

We aren't going all the way back to the extreme of the old jungle where you would just get crushed unless you were Warwick

The biggest difference here though is that we will be offering itemization that will help champions who need that extra boost in the jungle. Champions who are already super strong in the jungle may opt to not build these items
------------------------------------------------------
""Well a lot of the directional changes we're making for Season 3 are to make sure there are niches for the various jungle types.

For example

When we do these changes for Season 3


  

 


                                               **SEASON 3 ITEM OVERHAUL:**

**Morello**

""We are adding a lot of support-oriented items with this in mind

Zero CS is needed to keep support viable (it's actually always been the optimal way to play, peel or set up kills. Making the lane fight for CS is inferior to that.""





**Morello**


""Definitely looking at this - we'll be getting away from same starts.""




**Morello** remarking they are aiming to make Attack Speed / On-hit builds ( think Malady + Madred's Blood Razors ) viable:


""Actually yes - we're trying to make that a viable build.""


                                  




                                                **SEASON 3 CHAMPION REMAKES:**

**Morello** shared that Karma and Heimerdinger are the current focus regarding ability rework



  ""Some priorities have changed

And none of these will make progress till after Season 3 changes go out.""


**Morello** about a little status update on the Heimer remake:

""Xyph is working on an overhaul


**Morello** about why it takes so long to complete reworks and why Riot doesn't just divert other designers to help clean up the champions who need it the most.




""This is because resource allocation is very complex. I'll give you a fast answer about it here though

Essentially, for example) those resources are tighter. Additionally, one designer is all a project needs (and more in many cases is damaging) - IronStylus put it pretty eloquently when he said ""no matter how many mothers you throw at it, it takes nine months to make a baby.""

Testing is actually the tougher thing, but new champions really don't effect it - we just hired enough people to do both (since champions are cool and important too). We actually just added more to a ""reworks team"" also to increase this output.

Could we do anything faster if we literally dropped everything and only did that? Sure







                                                  **SEASON 3 FEATURES:**


**rjcombo** made mention that Riot will be aiming to improve the ladder system


""I did reveal several features we're actively working on in an earlier post in this thread




**rjcombo** on a built in voice chat feature for League.


""We've done some research on this and are not convinced native VOIP is highly valuable for improving the community experience

That's not to say we'll never add VOIP to the game. It's just not a high priority.""



**rjcombo** also spoke very briefly about the a possibility of seeing an achievement system in S3

&gt;""It's unlikely we'll have achievements for the start of Season 3, we'll be very focused on making sure players aren't encouraged to do silly things to earn rewards""






I'm sorry for the formatting



edit1: 

   
                         **Mastery Changes for Season 3**



**Morello** mentioned:

""In Season 3



                                     **Champion Scale**

Why some champions are so much taller or scaled up than others



**RiotNarya** said:

""Yup, off scale. Compare MF to some of the Sona models for example. Those are both female champs of approximately the same height, etc. and they are very different. Don't have an exact timeline but it's on the radar!""

* You get the whole wraith camp for yourself

* You have 2 gp10s and boots at the 15 minute mark [sic]

* You get focussed by the enemy bot lane (more of a masochist-like good feeling

* The AD Carry brings a ward to the lane as he sees that you can't afford any at the moment

* Your AD carry survives with about 10 hp because of your clutch shield/heal/peel

* THE BRUSH IS YOURS! The enemy support doesn't even dare stepping in there anymore. That's my territory now and I'm gonna do whatever the fuck I please in there (mostly walking back and forth and in and out)!

* There are 2 enemy wards in the range of a single pink ward from you.

Apparently doing bad in one game coupled with people trashtalking you in chat without you falling for their provocations is enough to warrant being banned. There's clearly something wrong with the tribunal if a case like this gets punished solely based on the number of reports without bothering to check the actual circumstances.

Doesn't matter what the percentage is. It is important that to receive an email for when you get pardoned. 
My reasoning is that in real life

You are a student right? Spending thousands of $ (or your parents do) for education in a prestigious university.

One night you get drunk out of your mind (don't say I don't do that

I.e. - I am a student

The police levels with you and gives you a warning - in other words you are pardoned. At this very moment you realise how close you were to ruining it all and you are rather thankful for the 2nd chance you get.

No item has a better fit anywhere on anyone than the Hydra on Pokeplank. Gangpoke? Too sexual? Anyhow

You want reasons? What, here's why:  

1. **Parrrrrley procs Hydra's AoE passive.**

2. **Hydra's use effect stacks Tear of the Goddess.**  
As if you need more than the first reason, waiting to be able to afford your stuff.  

3. **Parrrrley crits = Hydra crits.**  
Could Tiamat Fiora Ult crit? No and yet everyone who played her got 3k Elo and a Mustang from Riot with custom Tiamat rims. Gangplank already has 99% crit chance from Trinity Force and Infinity Edge

1369663774.0,1f4yba,Vi's sister; a theory,Twibs,4230,2529,739,"In the Howling Abyss we hear

**Assumptions made:** someone in the Riot design team is a DC comic fan.

_________________________

We hear that Vi grew up in Piltover

We learn from her lore that she is very technologically apt

She begins life as a criminal

From this I have come to the conclusion that Vi's sister is Sona.

_______________

*Wat.*

_______________

This is where the assumption comes heavily into play - in DC comics there is a character known as **Ravager V** - Rose Wilson. She has above-average physical ability including strength, but now fights on the side of good.

_________

*umm*

_________

The point of this though, he preferred the use of **non-violent means**. He also inherited the ability to astrally project himself and control the motor functions of an enemy - similar to how Sona's music immobilises hers.

This is where I see a parallel to Sona - as well as the shopkeeper saying they look similar

________

*That's a bit of a stretch*

Quiet you

*Bite me*

______________

This is all well and good, their father; Slade Wilson aka Deathstroke.

Deathstroke has a superhuman intellect as well as enhanced physical abilities which he **gained from a serum** he was injected with - and subsequently injected Rose with to grant her these qualities.

As well as his **superhuman strength, he has the ability of **regeneration at a greatly accelerated rate**, which grants him **immunity to poisons and illnesses**. [Sound familiar?](http://images.wikia.com/leagueoflegends/images/7/77/Singed_OriginalSkin.jpg)

To add to this, where a certain girl grew up. My theory is while Sona was left in Ionia, Singed perhaps took some *subjects* back to Zaun for trials.

And this last one is just for fun, whose power is to transform from [Human to Cheetah form, gaining enhanced strength](http://images.wikia.com/leagueoflegends/images/0/03/Nidalee_LeopardSkin_Ch.jpg).

_____________

TL:DR - Sona and Vi are sisters

Start the match as Ashe, being forced to choose another hero that has not yet been summoned yet - some other AD carry, or pick a completely different champion to mix it up.  Come back as Alistar or an AP hero. 

Just a fun thought for a new mode-type. You'd see more champions and variety.  You might see forced ganks to get rid of certain champions.

The short answer is, tanks can do damage to your ADC, as do the tanky bruisers. Enough damage infact, that by the time your ADC gets to the enemy carries, they'd get burst in a second.

I know I'm not the only one who has had to explain this to belligerent ally bruisers and tanks. Ones especially focused on 'squishies' are usually the ones who leave their carries to be chased down by tanks and bruisers

&gt;I'll try finding the Riot post, at least, they're going to tone down on it from here on.

&gt;E: Found it. It's in response to the whole ""females in costumes""

&gt;""So.. we talkin' Anivia 'n such as well? There's a few things in the works that would qualify here. I myself am very much for pushing the boundaries in what we'd consider monstrous females. In my opinion we probably could have gone crazier with Zyra and Elise especially. We've milked the ""girl in a costume"" thing pretty dry and we need to look towards character design rather than costume design. We'll certainly still have women in costume

&gt;One of the reasons that I'd love us to not be relegated to humanoids for such female creatures is that characters like Zyra and Elise can be problematic when making skins. There's not a ton of features or large distinguishing parts of their bodies that can serve as landmarks for change. If we're unable to make some distinct silhouette or fairly massive internal detail breakups

&gt; So yeah. There's some stuff in the works. I think it fits the bill

**League of Legends Announcer Packs**

Once in a blue moon for the last three years, and people in general that we should have announcer packs! For example: Jax: ""Double kill."" just picture that in your mind as you play your favorite character, it brings a new stimulation of satisfaction in playing league of legends itself.

As a gamer all my life, Jayce, Power slam!"" from Vi. Interactions, taunts, laughs, jokes, bluepill animations just makes the game so much cooler. I even changed my language pack to the korean sounds/in-game text just to feel like I'm playing a completely different game.

Now I don't know if there is a story behind every announcer (every region) or why we haven't had these announcer packs or if it's because it isn't seen as a higher priority, this would be a great idea to maintain people's addiction to the game. I wouldn't even mind hearing Phreak have a soundpack where it'll be like ""Tons of damage!"" for a penta kill.

**TLDR**
I would drop 50 bucks on just for a choice of a new announcer
**This is only a suggestion that has been poking me in the brain for a very long time. I have even made petitions to see what people think and I have finally reached my ""Wits end"" in thinking about this subject.**

Gentleman Cho'gath does not have new spell animations and simply has a Voice over and Visual change.
This applies to Brolaf as well as the only spell animation change is his Undertow which would have looked ridiculous had they not made the minor change.

According to Riot's own tier list these two skins belong in the 1350 RP as they ""go above and beyond the quality of 975 RP skins but don’t quite reach legendary status."" 

Solution? Revisit these skins and add spell visual upgrades to make them worth the 1820 RP or simply abide by your tier system and put these skins where they belong and refund players who have bought them as 'legendary skins' 470 rp.

TL;DR- Gentleman Cho'gath and Brolaf are not worth 1820 and belong in the 1350 skin tier.

edit: It has been pointed out to me that this is the same with Nunu Bot ~~and Red Baron corki~~ and I believe those skins should also be reduced in price or further developed.

1372281504.0,1h4vgm,7-point Criticism of the New Draven Passive,magzillas,4368,2704,981,"I don't think there's much room for argument that Draven's laning phase is pretty stupidly strong.  Now

But I digress.  The point of this post is not to contest that Draven is or isn't OP.  Rather, and certainly in line with Draven's intentionally ridiculous, over-the-top design, Adoration serves not simply as a nerf to the Lanes of Draven, but a problematic, and potentially frustrating, replacement to wicked blades.

For those who aren't in the know:

&gt; **Adoration:** Whenever you kill a minion or catch a spinning axe

I'll try to keep my criticisms as organized as possible.

----------------------------------------------

**Problem 1: It compounds reward with reward.**

* If you're not getting kills

* If you are getting kills

-------------------------------------------------

**Problem 2: It compounds detriment with detriment.**

* Losing half of your stacks on death is perhaps what I despise most about this new passive.

* You're already out several CS and experience because you died.  But this passive adds insult to injury by ditching half your stacks.  That's real fun

* You might say ""Magzillas, there's nothing fun about losing half the stacks you worked for when you die when the stacks are literally all it has going for it.

* Inhibits the ability of this passive to serve a comeback purpose.  In such a situation

-----------------------------------------------

**Problem 3: It leads to a dead end.**

* This is a problem also present

* This passive is designed such that it will become useless when the Draven hits 6 items and full consumables.

* It's a bit of an extreme scenario
 
-------------------------------------------------

**Problem 4: It means nothing to the Draven playstyle.**

* Wicked Blades wasn't the most interesting passive

* Other champions typically have a passive that is integral to their design or playstyle, Darius, Tristana, Viktor)

* All Adoration does is make the Draven want to get kills...but that's no different than what Draven already wants to do.

---------------------------------------------

**Problem 5: It doesn't make any sense.**

* A typical champion passive involves something intrinsic and self-contained within the champion.  

* Apparently we're now in the Hunger Games

* Basically

* Admittedly

-----------------------------------------------

**Problem 6: The arguments for Adoration

* I've heard three main arguments supporting adoration as opposed to a wicked blades rebalance.

* The first is that a **rebalanced wicked blades would do nearly nothing early game and that apparently that's no fun.**  But this apparently isn't a problem for Xerath, or Syndra, whose level 1 passives give them a whopping ~5 armor, nothing, ~12 health over 4 seconds on spellcast, and nothing, respectively.

* The second is that **Adoration leads to super feel-good moments when you kill someone and get a bunch of gold.**  Yea, or grabbing a CS thanks to the bleed.  And as mentioned, losing half your adoration stacks as you stare at your death screen definitely does NOT feel good.

* The third is that **Adoration can be balanced because ""there is a value where its underpowered

----------------------------------------------

**Problem 7: It kills the fundamental theme of the blood brothers. (Draven and Darius)**

* Keyword is blood.

* New passive does not involve blood.

* Draaaaven is not pleased.

* See [this comic](http://i.imgur.com/fpck2zV.png) submitted by /u/Baalhrezem

-----------------------------------------------

**Some potential solutions**

So

* Retain wicked blades with early-game nerf.  Adjust spinning axe to interact with wicked blades

* Convert wicked blades from a static value to a value based off of Draven's bonus AD.

* Replace wicked blades with part of blood rush.  E.g.

* If we're really dead-set on keeping adoration, and lose half on death.

-------------------------------------------------

**Acknowledgment:**  This critique is meant to be constructive.  I can certainly appreciate that Riot is addressing a balance issue with Draven


Thank you for reading.

Some of you may readily recognize the name 3xecutioner as he is often playing in the featured spectator games on the front page of the client. He was permabanned earlier this week

For those of you that can't access the forums,"" but the second, which in this case is supposed to give a detailed explanation of the unique beast that is a permaban (Lyte has stated that all permabans are accompanied with a unique Riot explanation), was just another form letter.

3xec claims in the thread that he has opened 2 support tickets

This whole thing is further complicated by 3xec's claim within this thread that one of his final games before being banned was played with Riot employees

So far, or Riot response on the forums. I should make it clear that I have no affiliation at all with 3xec, it's just an interesting topic that I think needs some more attention. 

Surely we don't have ALL the information

EDIT: I'm not sure when it was moved to the tribunal section to the forums, the tribunal had absolutely no involvement in this decision. Curious.

EDIT 2: Just got removed from front page. zzzzzzzz. There might be one incoming anyway

EDIT 3: Just received this message from the mods. ""The reason this was removed from the front page is because: Don't make accusations without sufficient evidence to back up your claim. Witch hunt."" Which is weird because, and no one is being witch hunted. A quest for more information, for a response, is not a witch hunt. The direction the comments have taken is not only something I have no control over, but it's the community's voice. The mods just removed a post that took top post on front page in an hour and a half. But there's no Riot-reddit collusion going on...

EDIT 4: It appears we've been reinstated? 

EDIT 5: And we're down again. Color me confused. Witch Hunt- An investigation carried out ostensibly to uncover subversive activities but actually used to harass and undermine those with differing views. Really? That's what I was doing?

1365651976.0,1c43rv,Draven's Spinning Axe to be reverted; Volty reflects on his design decisions,RiotVolty,2795,1173,475,"Summoners
I'd like to go in-detail with some recent changes to Draven's Spinning Axe and what you can expect in 3.6 (barring major disasters and other issues which would delay the change).  TLDR: We're reverting axe placement to be like it was on release.  But I'd like to take an opportunity to share some thoughts and details with you on this.

Patch 3.5 included these two changes to Draven's Spinning Axe:

Spinning Axe
Now leads Draven more accurately when he is benefiting from Movement Speed increases
Axe drop location will no longer be placed partially inside walls / terrain

The first change modified the calculation for how far to lead Draven when he moves after throwing the Spinning Axe. In particular, and this was aimed at making that much less common.

With these goals in mind, Ghost, and the like.  In contrast, the calculation employed at Draven's release only looked at your base movement speed and flat modifiers from things like boots.  The release formula was much more consistent, something which I valued when I first developed it. But since then I felt that I could sacrifice consistency in favor of giving Draven players more control.

In any case, it often lead you too far for you to realistically catch or want to catch if it was so far away. We were aware, prior to shipping the change, that this was generally going to be the result. I did not anticipate that this was the incorrect thing to do at the time however.

Draven players have been very talented in developing playstyles which are suited to the particulars of how Draven has worked since his release. Most notably

The change in 3.5 was very disruptive to this playstyle, which is likely the 3.6 patch.

This series of events has caused me to reflect on how I might do things differently in the future. For one

One final note: the second patch note, we have also now blocked the Spinning Axe destination from falling on the opposite side of terrain. This was much requested and long overdue, and I'm excited to get that out to you ASAP.

Thanks everyone for your feedback and patience. See you in the League of Draven soon!

Volty

After playing this game for almost 2 years

After you reach level 5 or something, you are starting to look into getting your first rune page. This is where I discovered how stupidly expensive they actually were.

Without double IP boost

What are the standard rune pages?

**AD Runepage:**

AD Marks/ Armor Pen Marks: 1845/ 3690

Armor Seals: 1845

Magic Resist Glyphs: 1845

AD Quints: 3075

**Total cost**: 8610 / 10455

---

**AP Runepage:**

AP Marks/ Magic pen Marks: 3690/ 3690

Armor Seals: 1845 (If you haven't already bought an AD page with these runes

Magic Resist Glyphs: 1845 ((If you haven't already bought an AD page with these runes

AP Quints: 3075

**Total cost:** 10455

--- 

Now these are just the standard runes, is just too much.

Let's say I get 120 IP each game (this is considering that I win every game), and a lot more in reality, because you don't win every game.

Now, and 350+- IP per win. But it's one of the most expensive RP purchases in the store. 

IP Boost 30 days + IP Boost 50 wins 3490+2560 = 6050 RP. That is 35 Euroes / 45 Dollars.

--- 

Like this isn't bad enough

810 IP per rune. That is 7290 IP for 9 Marks. I personally don't think this is an acceptable price to charge +  it takes an enormous amount time to farm up this IP.

Not only this
 
Riot is pretty much forcing you to spend money on RP

/ I guess this was kind of a rant


---

EDIT: Putting in a comment

*One of the main reasons runes need to be removed.*

*I ask you reddit, you can unlock every champion and all the runes just by playing the game."" You're right. You can. After MANY years of playing you can. I've played this game for 3 years now, with almost 3000 normal games, and about 1000 ranked games. I've only purchased ONE champion with RP, and every other bit of RP I've had has gone to skins. I currently own 83 champions, and 3 rune pages because I refuse to spend any actual money on unlocking shit that should be given to us for free (champs and runes, or just champs if they were to remove runes). Players with a larger champ pool, when all players arent on an even playing field.*

*Think of it this way. I'm playing Chess competitively. If it was based on Riots model, and I don't have any.*

*Or if you want to go to a more physical sport. It'd be like me playing football in tennis shoes against someone in cleats

*Players with a full champion pool can trade champions much easier than those who can't. Players who a full champion pool can LEARN more champions than those who can't!. B-b-b-but free weeks! No

*""But you'd never be able to master all 100+ champs anyway!"" Also not entirely true, making you better at the game and playing against said champion.*

*I understand why riot does it

DotA 2 does it right
*

Tip #02: Wards are needed not just for playing passively

Tip #03: One of the best times to engage on the enemy is when they go for a last hit. Every AD will last hit

Tip #04: When trading hits

Tip #05: Good supports know the CDs on their spells. Better supports know their AD's. The best supports know their opponents'.

Tip #06: Summoner spells are expensive. Having summoners up

Tip #07: The best time to engage is the opponent's worst time to get engaged on

Tip #08: In lane
HP

Tip #09: When playing a ranged support vs a melee support

Tip #10: When against an AD with Cleanse

Tip #11: When playing a melee support vs a ranged support

Tip #12: When laning vs an AD with Cleanse and you have a CC ult (Sona, use your ult asap to blow Cleanse. Cleanse has 210 sec CD, while ults have ~120 sec CD. This gives you a one minute window to ult full effect.

Tip #13: Observe the opposing lane's patterns. If they are passive most of the time and suddenly go aggro

Tip #14: Keep tabs on opposing wards. Wards only last for 3 min

Tip #15: When on purple side and you want to hit level 2 faster

Tip #16: Autoattack. Use your autoattack! As a ranged

Tip #17: Explore new starting options. You can now start Rejuv Bead and Faerie Charm for a faster GP10 or try Flask for high sustain!

Tip #18: Sightstone is actually a gp10. Each ward you dont buy is 75 gold saved...

Tip #19: Decide before the game

Tip #20: Watch this. No

Tip #21: Janna hard counters Leona in lane. Janna nados makes it impossible for Leona to engage with Zenith Blade.

Tip #22: Use your Explorer Ward for temporary vision. Its perfect for warding the enemy lane brush or to secure a buff level 1.

Tip #23: It can be okay to use stuns on tanks. If your AD kills their tanks faster than their AD kills your tanks

Tip #24: The Biscuteer mastery potion is the only pot

Tip #25: Having trouble landing Nami's Q in lane? Predict where the enemy AD will stand to last hit a low HP minion and shoot the Q there!

Tip #26: When you use Help, Pix stacks on top of them and your Q will land 100%.

Tip #27: Damage is calculated

Tip #28: If the world is about to end

Tip #28: When playing Soraka and you expect a Flash + ult

Tip #29: Blitzcrank's Rocket Grab actually fires from his right hand. This means if you position correctly

Tip #30: Lulu's E is one of the few spells that gives vision of invisible targets

Tip #31: When playing Blitz vs a target with an escape

Tip #32: When fighting 2v2 bot

Tip #33: ADs typically have a longer CD on ther summoner's. Season 3 patch inceased summoner CD's

Tip #34: Many skillshots have a range slightly beyond the range indicator. knowing the full range of Blitz Q and Zyra E is rather important!

Tip #35: Control the minion wave. If there is a huge wave pushing towards you, there is a huge wave pushing towards them, push the wave to the tower before backing, or you'll lose waves.

Tip #36: When enemy targets you

Tip #37: Janna shield is a funny spell. In lane the shield is good to block dmg. But in fights

Tip #38: Try turning Line Missile Display on/off. It's inaccurate on Blitz

Tip #39: Sightstone should ALWAYS be bought and be either the 
first or second item (first would be early Philo or Ruby Crystal for HP).

Tip #40: It's typically better to get a half charged Nunu ult on 4 or 5 enemies rather than a fully charged ult on 1 or 2!

Tip #41: When you are playing with a Thresh

Tip #42: When using Dark Passage on Thresh

Tip #43: Free harass is best harass

Tip #44: Use brush to surprise with spells. Champs like Zyra and Thresh have long wind-ups

Tip #45: If you want to check if a brush is warded

Tip #46: When trying to all-in vs a Vayne past lv6

Tip #47: Leona's Q resets your attack

Tip #48: When playing support Alistar

Tip #49: Always hover over players' summoner spells when you hold Tab and determine if they have summoner spell CD. Never get surprised

Tip #50: Be nice to everyone in solo queue

I thought this would be a fantastic idea for newer viewers. My idea was maybe in champ select when there is that downtime right before a game. The announcers could quickly go over the champs skills and ults. 

He doesn't know a whole lot of champs

He knows even fewer ults. He knows Crescendo and ""The thing that makes the ring that no one can get out of"" (Jarvan's Ult) and he has learned the summoners.

My father doesn't really get too excited about things anymore. He stopped watching football a few years back and dislikes baseball. It's actually pretty funny to watch him watch a game. His favorite team is Curse and his favorite player is Voyboy. When Curse wins he's happy for a while, so for that I say thank you Riot, and thank you Curse.  

[Here is his request for Riot](http://imgur.com/a/J1fGx)  

It says the following:
""My name is Jim

RIOT PLS"" 

TL;DR - My dad is old and doesn't remember/know all champ ults. RIOT PLS give a desc of champs in matchmaking. 

**EDIT:** Thank you for all the support for my father. Whether you agree with the idea or not

Common Questions:  
Q: You dad's not old! Why doesn't he just play LoL???  
A: The reason my dad is ""too old"" is because he was exposed to Agent Orange in Vietnam and has lost a lot of his hand eye coordination as a result. The too old thing is a joke between my dad and I.   
Q: Just have him go to the wiki. That will help.   
A: My dad isn't exactly an expert with computers. I think he's still using his TI 64. Do you think his 20MB hard drive would hold the League??  
Q: Why don't you just tell him what they do?  
A: When I'm here
Q: I see you have a second monitor. Why don't you pull up your client/website there?  
A: That is my computer we're watching on. If I'm not home

1375670022.0,1jpsbh,The 10 types of people you meet in bot games,cubemstr,2916,1315,1300,"1) The First Win Guy.

Just an average league player who was busy most of the day

2) The losing streak guy. 

Poor bastard has played 10 games today, but he'll probably play Amumu and keep cry on all game. 

3) The Level 30 with only 2 normal wins

How did this happen? No one is quite sure. Either he never plays anything other than bots, but he's not gonna win by himself either. 

4) The actual newbie

Hey, but still. He'll probably have 10 farm at 20 minutes, and buy the recommended items in order, but you can't really fault him for it too much. He's level 7. The bots will get fed, but you can handle it. 

5) The guy who plays like he's a newbie.

His ranking says Level 30

6) The Guy who thinks he's Froggen.

Locks in Anivia. Tries to all in at level 2. Dies. Respawns. Dies again. Blames teammates. Rage quits. 

7) The Power Gamer

At 5 minutes in you see that he bought Sword of the Occult and a Mejai's. 5 minutes after that he starts roaming around the map into other people's lanes and killing everyone before leaving. By the end of the game (15 minutes in total)

8) The Guy Trying out a Champion for the First Time. 

He just bought ~~Zed~~ ~~Kha-zix~~ ~~Kennen~~ Zac and wants to figure out his mechanics before jumping into a PVP game. His build order will be precise to what players in LCS are building

9) The ""Group Mid and Push Plz"" Guy

Apparently he only has like 10 minutes to play. So rather than doing the rational thing and just not queueing up

10) The ""DON'T TAKE MY FARM"" guy

1366109989.0,1cgdck,I'm colourblind and i can't see Zac's blobs,Viciouswall_euw,4746,3147,425,"Hello everybody
With the magestic green ground of sommuners rift i founded dificult to see where were his blobs landing.

Ofc when i'm clearing the jungle, if i step one of my blobs is a pure accident because i have to focus my view on the Game and the champions.

Some curious facts:
- As everybody knows
- 1 in 10 males have some tipe of colourblindness
- some tipes ofcolourblindness dont affect your dayly life. (I discovered at age 22 in a friends meeting talking about my 2 year old brown shirt
- 6% of all males have Deuteranomally (what i have
- Finally

I just can't tell how much colourblind mode helps me. But this dont change champions colour.
I even considered to buy Zac's skin just to help me with this situation.
Instead i came here to allert the community and to help some people realize they are just like me.

This prblem CAN BE SOLVED easily if Riot does one very small change to the blobs... Turn their outline to white instead of green. Maybe if only colourblind mode is enabled or something.

Sorry for the wall of text and i hope i dont get hate because i'm a minnority.
If someone would like to put this as a RIOT PLS i dont Mind at all. That would be An. Awsome change for a lot of people.

Btw, he must be Overpowered =P (joking)




TLDR: people with Deuteranomally have to make an enormous effort to see Zac's blobs especially in teamfights

EDIT 2: WOW Front page! Thanks guys! Im glad more people can see this and hopefully word gets around thats really what i want! Gonna go to bed now and tomorrow Ill look at all comments and reply. Thanks again! 

EDIT 3: Wow. It is unreal the response i got and I really appreciate and enjoy all your comments. Basically to sum up the comments you all made theres a few things I can take away: 1. People are worried about smurfs. Okay yes smurfing is unfair in this case but we can't technically take away someone's right to create a new account
Another thing evident in the comments was that overall this is a great idea! You all had little things you would take away or add in different cases but overall everyone agreed that this SHOULD happen. And thats why this is great. We all want more competitive fun in the league scene and these tourney's bring it! I love everyone for getting involved and appreciate all the comments. Thanks again guys it means alot. And what would this post be without a ---- RIOT PLS give us our amateur tournaments! --- Would love to hear more if anyone wants to dm me,False,self,t5_2rfxx,1363634814.0,,,t3_1ahq0e
1376064921.0,1k171j,I'd recommend not making World Playoffs plans based on the assumption you can get tickets to every one of the the studio days,Tnomad,2639,1063,341,"Hey friends

A lot of the people that have been talking to me and messaging me recently have been asking for advice on World Playoffs/Champs travel plans. Many of them are basically assuming they'll be able to get tickets to all

This is kind of concerning to me because I'm afraid people will book flights and hotels under the assumption that they'll be at the studio.

I don't really know anything about the studio location

I'm really afraid that the tickets are going to sell out in like... 5 seconds and then people will be shocked that they didn't get one. Right now

I apologize if I'm wrong about any of this

I played  game with my friend

When we try to queue again it says that we're still in game. Even though the Defeat screen clearly showed up and we even saw the summary screen. It says that ""several"" summoners are already in game

We both relog

And this is jsut one example. I mean why can't you accept invites while spectating? And why can't you take a look at your friendlist while ingame? Both features exist in Dota 2.

I don't think Riot should copy anything from Valve (they're different games and suitable for diffrent persons. They both have their thing) BUT I think they should just straight ouy copy their client. Because seriously. The LoL client is awful

And please don't tell me Riot can't afford making a new client (Yes I have actually recently heard things like that from people). I mean to listen how stupid that sounds. The company with the most played online game in the world backed up by the worlds 3rd largest internet company (Tencent) wouldn't be able to afford a new client?

1365586281.0,1c1xp7,League of Legends has the worst tutorial possible,NeedlefeetLoL,5400,3839,1081,"LoL has the worst tutorial for a game that I've ever seen. I just started up another smurf to play with a friend of mine who is new to the game and I decided to play the tutorial because why not. This is when I realised just how bad the tutorial is and how much it could be improved. The main problems I see are:

* **Thornmail is presented to Ashe as her only item.** There is no explanation of itemisation whatsoever. It should be explained that a carry, AD is used on your abilities when the (+X) is orange and AP is used on the green (+X). That armour and MR are soft capped, just like speed. Something that points out that BOOTS DON'T STACK.
* **Locked screen.** Locked screen presents so many disadvantages and I've never really played a MOBA or RTS with it. It's terrible. Players should learn to use unlocked screen as it helps with a lot of sniping abilities and map awareness. Since the first time you play you have a locked screen
* **Bonus damage.** Ashe starts with 30 damage from nowhere that allows her to melt through the minions. When new players get into game and don't do the same thing, you know, you *can't die* in the tutorial.
* **Heal/Revive as summoner spells.* Recommending Heal/Revive on an AD carry. Really? REALLY? Why not a brief tutorial about how using Barrier/Cleanse could save your life.
* **No last hitting instructions.** How do players know that the most efficient way to farm is through last hitting? I learned towards level 30
* **Increased gp10.** Confusing for players to get 3k gold in a few minutes as opposed to tens of minutes. Also doesn't explain gold generation and just how much of an effect it has. That might stop level 10 supports from taking half the cs. This isn't really one of the major problems though.
* **Proving Grounds rather than Summoner's Rift.** I sure as hell don't know where I'm going in this 3-laned behemoth. You mean you can not be in a lane and kill the jungle creeps instead? You mean I'm meant to tell people when the enemy in my lane is missing? You mean there are neutral minions that provide certain benefits/amounts of gold? None of this is explained. I had no idea what jungling was until around level 20 and I had no idea that blue or red gave buffs.


I know that it's been mentioned that the tutorial needs updating, so why not just teach the stuff that isn't complex and is cornerstone to any player.

**tl;dr:** The LoL tutorial teaches you very little of use and misses out key basics that likely leads to the terrible playerbase that we see today.

_______________________________________________________________

**Edit 1:** I suck at Reddit formatting.

_______________________________________________________________

**Edit 2:** I see that there are so many downvotes. I assume this is because everything I rant about is covered in Battle Training. I DID acknowledge this, a tank Annie, no last hitting. This being said, I actually had more fun playing with the new players than I do at my own elo. They weren't flaming each other and they weren't bound by the meta. Very refreshing. Anyway, the point is that they displayed the skills of someone who had played the tutorial (since it forces you to learn) and either played and ignored or straight up missed Battle Training, so my post still stands. The **tutorial** needs to be changed. Perhaps it should be split up into Beginner Tutorial and Advanced Tutorial, one which explains the basic mechanics, map awareness (MIAs) and warding. LoL is

**tl;dr:** I know that Battle Training addresses most of these issues but it doesn't seem to have an effect on low level players. It is also easily dismissible and I stick to my guns in saying that the tutorial should be changed and is currently more harmful than helpful.

______________________________________________________________

**Edit 3:** A lot of people seem to be misunderstanding what I intended with the itemisation part. Example builds explaining what stats do and the fact that certain abilities scale with AD or AP. I don't mean ""Ashe must stack Phantom Dancers, it is all that you can buy"".

EDIT! A question about the detailing on her face, here's the answer to why her face looks like it does:

So, but it's something that Team Diana talked about way back in the day.. is that her mark is a physical brand. The Solari elders literally took a tool and burned that mark into her face. Though, they were so blinded by ignorance, or maybe they liked irony so much, that they branded her with the ancient symbol of the moon. This scar burned her hair, giving her a larger forehead. After she flipped out, surrendering all her humanity to deep sadness and pain, they were burn marks and scorches coming from the magicalmoonlight affecting her eyes and causing her tears to boil on her face.

Counter arguments:

-Build health instead of armor

   This doesn't mitigate their damage output

-Stacking cleavers doesn't increase the armor reduction cap

   It's not the cap that's important its the fact that with multiple cleavers you can reach that max 30% reduction faster.  Any ability like heartseeker strike or rake that hits multiple times will deal much more damage on subsequent hits since the max armor reduction can be reached with the first or second hit.  Also the stats offered by TBC are just too perfect for AD casters

-Just CC them to death

This is production level code

I know you're coming out with a web based client at some point, CCP, and Blizzard all have much more stable clients without the need to move to a web based solution (which I personally see as a cop-out). Not to mention the client lacks snap-to-screen in windowed mode, and when playing fullscreen windowed crashes happen when running multiple monitors. 

I'm not hating on Riot or anything here, maybe once a year per player or something. Right now I crash maybe once per week. If you need help put out a hiring call, many people specialize in stability. 

In my opinion as a programmer we have to draw a line at what is acceptable production code

EDIT: Keep in mind this is a technical observation, not generating stacktraces, not using WinAPI correctly, just obvious, freshman in college type of coding oversights.

I apologize up front for this post propably being a wall of text in the end

As you all might know

Today marks the 11^th consecutive day at which I am not able to properly play nor even login due to a “connection error“. At random intervals I was able to login, which I did. They told me a tech specialist will contact me “soon“. Finally after five days said tech specialist contacted me but apparently did not read anything I wrote before. Instead he asked me for logs I've alredy sent and suggested solutions of which I already told them they won't work for me.

This is just my story. Other people might have experienced something else, sometimes even before every game. People who can not complete one game without disconnects. People who have started playing on a diffrent server. People who have given up completely and lost the faith in Riots competence to fix this problem.

So while this may not be a problem that affects every single player

All we've heard so far are soothing words, understatements and the usual and oh so very shallow „we're so sorry“. The lack of communication and the fact that they are forcing the players to go through all kinds of liabilities (sending logs, trying out solutions, restarting etc.) for a problem that was not caused on the side of the players is an insolence.

We finally want some answers! What is the situation? Is there any progress? Are people genuinely trying to fix the problem? How long do you estimate it will take to fix it? Are sales/TPA skins being extended

It is time for someone to step up and tell us what is going on and more importantly fix those problems once and for all!



**TL;DR: Many EUW players have severe problems logging in and/or playing for more than a week now. Riot does not help us nor properly communicates. Somebody help us!**



*Edit: Just to clarify: I do not want to hate on Riot here. I love League of Legends and I love Riot. All I want is to finally get some answers and ultimately be able to play once again. Also this is not a discussion about compensation but rather a discussion about server equality. While compensation also plays a minor part in that



*Edit2: Big thanks to each and every one of you for reading/supporting this post and contributing to the discussion. Also a shoutout to Jaraxo who helped me

I honestly did not expect such a massive feedback but it just shows how urgent this problem is and how many people are actually affected. Let us hope that our message reaches the right people and we will no longer be ignored. Riot hopefully acknowledges those mistakes and learns from them for the future. They need to step up their communication and make server functionality and equality their priority.

Stay strong my fellow summoners! We will master this crisis and one day we eventually shall meet again on the fields of justice! Cheers!



*Edit3: Seems like we are making progress folks. Riot recently updated one of their threads


*Edit4: Last night a hotfix has been applied and the connection error should be resolved for now.

1364757119.0,1bdeox,Getting Fit while watching streams! Why not?,snoopeh,4356,2835,671,"I think about a week ago someone mentioned how they were during games asking their team &amp; opponents to get involved and do exercises per kill/assist &amp; objective - this inspired me to try encourage it in my stream as well

A large portion of this sub reddit actively watches streams on a daily basis.. why not turn it into an activity/exercise routine? I understand you might not be physically fit enough to do 100 pushups or situps in a game - but start somewhere.. set yourself realistic goals and try and do it on a regular basis.. YOU WILL IMPROVE.

I was going by the rule on my stream of 10 pushups/situps per kill &amp; 5 for assist - it's achievable even for the not so fit among us. I remember when I could barely do 10 pushups, it might (like it did with me) end up in you eating a bit healthier and doing some running. Make sure you don't overdo it and try incorporate it into a balanced life style change at the same time ;)

So next time when watching the LCS, try this instead :)

1374018370.0,1ig77x,My thoughts on Rengar and why Riot shouldn't go through with them,OnlyRengar,4567,3045,1100,"Rengar Changes* sorry can't change title =P



* Before we get into my thoughts I would like every one to know I have been playing Rengar since release and have been with him through all his OP and UP times. These current changes are taking Rengar back into time and it really confuses me why Riot choses to take a unique play style like Rengar's and just dump it for another usual Tanky DPS champion.



Here is my post from the league forums on the topic.


I'd personally like to talk to you in private if that is possible ^.^ but these are my thoughts on your current changes

* General
- Health Regen

This looks good

* Unseen Predator
-Now becomes visible at the beginning of the leap

This actually sounds like a pretty big nerf
(Don't forget this also means people will actually be able to flash out of your leap now)

* Savagery 
- Attack Speed removed (Temporary for now - planning on putting something else here)
Ferocity Bonus: Savagery
- Damage lowered

Looks like you have pretty much dumped on Q's face

* Battle Roar
- Damage increased
- Cooldown decreased
- No longer grants Armor/MR - instead grants damage reduction from Physical Damage/Basic Attacks
Ferocity Bonus: Battle Roar
- Heal unchanged
- Now deals damage based on Rengar's level

So pretty much with the nerfs to Q it seems we will be seeing the tanky Rengar come back with Sunfire/Visage and spilt all day. With the base damage and cooldown reduced on this ability it will allow him to clear quicker and even though the heal isn't scaled on health it will still heal more than it would with health scaling if you don't only stack health but build resistances.

The change from Armor/MR to damage reduction from AD sounds a little troublesome

Another problem that arises with this buff to W is the return of AP rengar. If you reduce this abilities cooldown and buff its base damage

* Bola Strike
- Damage increased
- Bonus AD Ratio increased
Ferocity Bonus: Bola Strike
- Now deals damage based on Rengar's level
- Root duration increased

Once Again with these buffs towards his base damages on his E and W it seems you guys want him to return to his tanky state? Now rather than Rengar sniping off an opponent he seems to be one who roots them up deals a bit of damage and allows his team to clean it up.

* Thrill of the Hunt
- Cooldown decreased
- Duration increased
- Movement speed increased
- Enemies will now receive a particle over their head when Rengar can see them; Additionally

I don't get the reason you add this, taking away his global fear to other lanes and making it really easy to just play passive till the symbol goes away.




* Over all thoughts -
Riot seems to make no sense with Rengar, than once that got nerfed he was unseen for a long time. At the moment Rengar is coming back into play slowly because people finally found out they can just build him full assassin. I was totally fine with this because this was how riot wanted Rengar to be played. And now with these changes it seems like you guys think assassin is to broken on him so your changing him back to this tanky champion. I personally hate these changes as a Rengar main as it totally kills his playstyle and pretty much makes him this new champion. With these changes I feel Rengar will have a lot of problems trying to fight in teamfights as he is really easy to peel if he doesn't finish off an opponent with his first leap. With the current changes Rengar seems to now be a big lane bully with increased base damage on his W and his E. He will return to maxing E or W and now with scaling damage on ferocity will just spam W in lane to heal from it. His laning will be godlike and he will just push top non stop. There is no point of him trying to roam because people will easily walk away. His ult will be used to dominate top harder, by either running away or by 2v1ing while waiting for your ferocity to recharge in ult. The thing is you wish to make him a champion who is a sustained fighter, but the problem with that is he only has 1 leap out in the open and is melee. Not a lot of melee fighters are viable at the moment because they are so easily pealed, it really saddens me you make his ult visible to all and I truly believe it will be the one of the most useless ults compared to what it is used for now. 

If you wish to continue with these ult changes I beg that you atleast give everyone the icon/ sound so it isn't so obvious where Rengar is going.

I would really like to help you guys out with these changes, I've sent both of you requests and hope I can contact you guys!

Not everything might make sense because I'm sort of just ranting and I just woke up but oh well =)

-

So hopefully the true Rengar players will support me here and show that this change isn't for the good

So after a few weeks of absence, and 5 Plat-Dias on the other one. Then you obviously play the game, and afterwards your opponent gives you advice and tips, what you did wrong and how to improve it.

So this Idea beign generally awesome in my oppinion, i can't even start a single game cause either no one replies, or we get stuck with 5-7 players.

So, feel free to join the chatroom 'Platinum vs Silver' on EUW (I know it exists in NA too, but I'm not sure how exactly the chatrooms called)

Let's hope we can bring it back to Life! :)

Its extremely useful to point these out to your jungler so they know where the enemy can see and how long it will be before the ward runs out. Perhaps also include a timer in the chat like when you kill dragon/baron. Or would that just make calling those types of things out easy mode.... I dunno

**Edit**: After reading the comments, we should be able to choose which pings we wish to have at hand on our  4 direction wheel, similar to hotkeys. The suggestion about having a marker of some kind that lasts for 3 minutes is also ridiculous, although i am fairly certain that was sarcasm.... but i have found you can't really assume that sometimes... 

As for most of the complaints that say this is dumb and it would just be followed by more pointless pings (brb, thats absurd to think that riot would let LoL get that micro'd. This is just a small addition to eliminate the need to type ""ward"" if things get hectic in lane which they can do easily. A lot of people dont rely only on the smart pings 100% of the time anyway. Its often a mix between the new pings and the traditional pings and typing. 

Don't be getting all retro/hipster/oldskool league on any sort of innovation

**2nd Edit**: Need is such a strong word. How about (in a olden southern female voice) ""Golly gee, of course, if it's too much trouble fo ya, I know I could get along just fine without it.""

1366742727.0,1cyb6g,11 Things I Learned While Jungling My Way to Diamond.,NeoDharma,2770,1277,537,"Hello!  I am a Diamond IV Jungle and Support main.

I've been playing off and on since closed beta

I reached Diamond a month or so ago, I took stock of what I thought I could be doing wrong, and re-evaluated my roles.  This started out as just an exercise for myself, but after showing a friend, I'm taking his advice and posting it here.

I think this list could help a lot of Bronze-Gold junglers improve and move up

**EDIT: Thanks so much for all the feedback!  This got WAY more attention than I ever expected!  To clarify on a few things..  Yes

**#1 is based on the assumption that you can play 3-4 junglers equally well.  Picking a jungler you can't play well just to fit the team comp could be a mistake -- you'll have to make that decision yourself :)**

**EDIT2: I've changed #10 based on the great criticism provided by you all.  Thank you!**

*NOTE: This is all just my opinion

So

##Things I’ve learned while Jungling to Diamond (In No Particular Order):

**1.	Pick your Jungle based on team composition

* The Jungler has to fulfill different roles depending on the team composition

* Example: don’t just blindly pick Eve because you’re awesome and expect to carry with ganks.  If you’ve got a Chogath mid and a Renekton top

* However, so you’ll want to play a jungler like Nasus or Volibear to fill that spot.

* If you are first pick, or you can build damage if your team needs that).    Also, picking a front-line tank jungle is rarely a bad thing.

* I’d recommend having 3 or 4 “main” jungles that you are comfortable with

**2.	Watch opponents’ items.**

* This is especially important when it comes to your first double-buff gank opportunity.  If the enemy Top Laner has Red Elixir and 4 HP Pots

**3.	Patience pays off.**

* When you’re going for a gank

**4.	Ganks can be successful without netting a kill.**

* Burning enemy summoners will let your lanes have an easier time

* If your lane is having a hard time farming and you can push their laner back to base

* In some particular situations

**5.	Keep Track of Enemy Summoners**

* Enemy blew flash the first time you ganked?  Come back!  Especially jungling someone like Maokai

**6.	Counterjungling is dangerous!**

* A lot of people want to “outjungle” their opponents and take their buffs, especially in Solo Queue.

* Watch the position of your lanes vs. enemy lanes before you go into the jungle.  Especially when invading near bot lane (invading red when you’re purple side or blue when you’re blue side).  Getting caught in the enemy jungle is an easy way to get yourself killed

* If the enemy jungle is ganking a lane and you’re across the map unable to help

**7.	Dying with double buffs early is one of the WORST things you can do.**

* On behalf of top laners everywhere, your level 3 dive SOMEHOW doesn’t work, etc.,  not only did you just feed a kill to the enemy team, but you probably just lost your top lane in the process.

* As mentioned previously

**8.	Keeping up in Experience is very important.**

* This is especially true when playing very gank-heavy early jungles like Lee Sin

* When your lanes go back

* Level-wise

**9.	Buy Wards.  LOTS of Wards.**

* Yeah, pick up a few wards.  

* If your top lane doesn’t have a ward

* Giving your team more vision not only helps them avoid ganks

* When you think you want to try dragon soon

**10.	Your job is to get your LANES fed

* *EDIT2: You guys have posted some really great reasoning to disagree with this point.  I've always tended towards a more support-oriented jungle role, especially for the bruiser/carry junglers that are common.  The thing I've taken away from the feedback on this point is that gold distribution is an interesting thing, and should be considered depending on the jungler you're playing.*

* If your laner is in danger of dying

**11.	Communicate and Be POSITIVE!**

* This is more general than just jungling, more efficient use of your time, and better winrates!

* If you want a smiteless leash so that you can gank top with double buffs

* Ask your lanes where the wards are

* I will often ask “how’s top lane going” if there hasn’t been much action there.  Your laner will usually tell you it’s fine

* If you’re going to be leaving a lane alone to focus on another area, bot lane be careful.”

* (Obligatory but true) -- Don't rage

1350317064.0,11il9l,TPA Toyz opinion on other mid laners in WC,suryd,2293,807,822,"**From his facebook**


以下是一篇關於參加S2大賽12支隊伍的中路玩家分析，排名不分先後。


Below is a list of my analyses of the other midlaners in WC


**SAJ_NIXWATER** - 雖然他沒有頂尖的對線技巧，但是為什麼他們能夠取得S2的資格甚至打敗DIG多抱2萬5獎金回家？原因在於他們隊伍了解到自己隊伍的缺點找到最適合他們的META，雙中。這個META讓他們把缺點都藏起來了，迫使對手需要重新適應整個遊戲風格。


Not the best mid-laner mechanics-wise


**SK_ocelote** - 對線技巧不錯，但是不足以在世界頂尖選手中取得優勢，也是一位喜歡在6級前遊走GANK的中路選手。年代的過去，他的蛇女再也沒辦法在舞台上壓制對手，球女在S2資格賽對上CLG.EU曝光，小組賽再也選不到。簡單來說是在這次比賽自信的角色並沒有很多。


Good laning mechanics, and his Orianna was also revealed in his games against CLG.eu, so you could say this time round he was not playing with champions he was very confident with.


**CLG_Bigfatlp** - 曾經第一季的神，遇誰壓遇，怎麼打怎麼嬴。第二季的到來，我也不知道到底是jiji退步了，還是其他選手慢慢的跟上腳步，相比起來他跟世界頂尖的選手對線技巧比起來稍微有點不足，導致小組賽中路都拿不到太大的優勢。振作阿JIJI!


Once a god in S1, I am unsure if he deproved, or if everyone improved, but anyhow his skill his lacking compared to other midlaners. Work harder, jiji!


**iG_Zz1tai** - 擁有一流的打線技巧，喜歡用雪球角色，例如蛇女，斯溫等等角色。跑線能力偏低，因為他喜歡一直壓制你中路，就是因為太依賴使用雪球角色導致他整系列比賽在後期表現得不太好，跟他對線需要更加小心，後期會戰要嬴不會難。


Extremely good mechanics


**WE_Misaya** - WE目前來說算是一個全新的隊伍，兩位新成員加入，雖然台柱微笑依然佔領世界前三強AD。隊伍上的配合度不夠，而這次比賽他選用的角色包括Orianna，Vlad，Ryze。Orianna並沒有玩得非常純熟，而Vlad跟Ryze卻並不是隊伍中致勝的關鍵，嬴是穩穩的，輸也是穩穩的。


WE is a new time as of now as two members have recently joint in, and his Ryze and Vlad play, while stable, was not spectacular.


**NaJin Sword_SSONG** - Orianna的操控者，在韓國S2資格賽他的Orianna表現得非常好，8強對上我們運用一些選角心理令他兩場都沒辦法選到Orianna，對線技巧不錯，一些中路視野掌握度不夠，除了Orianna以外他需要熟練更多的角色。


Master of Orianna, but his control of mid-lane with regards to scope is imperfect. He also needs to learn more champions.


**TSM_Reginald** - 也許他已經了解到自己再也找不到S1那種侵略的Style，他往後唯一有比較大影響的只有Karthus，當一個對線技巧不足以讓你打出優勢跑線能力也不足的時候，Karthus將會是最好的選擇，穩穩的農，大招就是全球支援。也許他會選擇S3中淡出職業生涯？我不知道。


He has already realised he can no longer play his aggressive style of S1


**DIG_scarra** - 西門夜說.NA，也許大家覺得我在釣魚，我並沒有:D。有一定的對線技巧，愛嘴炮，自大，把自己整個形象都破壞了。整個年度裡面最大型的比賽卻選擇了Kata，我相信這十二支隊伍裡面都不會希望自己隊伍的中路選手只玩自己想玩的英雄，下場就是被賽前排名12的隊伍打到爛掉。


westdoor0204 of NA. Some of you may think I am trolling, ruining his image. His Katarina pick was a poor one, and he played a champion that he wanted to play, rather than what was beneficial for the team, causing his team to place last.


**M5_Alex.ich** - 雖然這次比賽他被單殺的次數很高，不得不佩服的是他對遊戲的認知與經驗，這次比賽選用了EVE，Gragas，Zliean。EVE毫無疑問的把IG跟我們都打爛了，實在是想不出任何應對的方式，他會選擇用Zliean是因為他的被動與復活吧，對團隊幫助極大，只是有點過於執著在這個角色了，另外他拿手角色Gragas卻是上個版本被nerf過的角色，當然不會是致勝的關鍵，Alex絕對是我遇過經驗最多最讓人有壓力的一個選手。


I got 1v1-ed by him multiple times and died. I am impressed by game experience and his use of Eve, he seems to have tunnel visioned too hard on Eve and Gragas post-nerf is less of a potent champion. Despite this he is one of the players that have made me most nervous throughout the whole tournament.


**CLG.eu_Froggen** - 很多採訪都有問到我那一位選手最難應付，我的回答是Froggen，為什麼？他是一個永遠都住在中路的玩家，個人操作技巧以及反應都是最頂尖的，隊伍給他的配合也是超過正常中路所得到的，試著想想看一級的Karthus會拿到四鬼、三狼、藍BUFF，導致Snoopeh的各種落後，當然我也很明白他們隊伍整個核心就是Froggen。而賽前我也跟隊友說CLG.eu在這次比賽幾乎不可能取得勝利，為什麼？因為這不是Froggen的年代，他曾經用過的角色一一被nerf，百份之百被ban的冰鳥，Orianna他也許不喜歡玩，幾乎就剩下Karthus了，這真的非常可惜。


Interviews ask me who the hardest midlaner to face is, and he doesn't play Orianna, so all he can play is Karthus. It's a waste.


**Azubu Frost_RapidStar** - 決賽的對手，對線技巧不錯，但是在於中路視野控制跟四鬼的控制力不足，導致幾乎每一場都被我outfram，還有一點就是對上我們卻把Orianna放出兩場，不知道是隊伍的討論還是他自己的個人決定，這就好像對上Froggen不ban冰鳥卻又不選的情況是相同的，值得尊敬的對手，擁有最頂尖的Skill shot技巧。把Lux演化成另一隻角色，非常厲害的一位玩家。


I played against him, and he got outfarmed every time. They also let me get Orianna twice - this is similar to not banning Anivia against Froggen. He is extremely proficient, especially with Lux.


**TPA_Toyz** - 至於我自己嘛....沒什麼好講了XD 只能說這次比賽的表現我很滿意。


I have not much to say with regards to myself except that I am satisfied with my play.

So i see a common mistake when the time comes to take baron.  
Typical scenario:
-lets go take baron!
-let the lifesteal/heavy AD tank baron
-why is it so slow when our tryndamere is in 99-0-0 ?  
  
Because Baron decreases the AD of the closest target by HALF!  
so if you have 160 ad it will be 80.
  
Please do a little favor to your team and tank baron if you are not playing an AD heavy champ.  
  
tldr: baron decreases the closest target's AD by half

""According to the Shinto religion, which is a celestial being. (Ahri's abilities are likely based off of a Celestial, since they're capable of teleporting, throwing spheres of light at enemies, etc.)

Idea: Start with one tail

Level 1 -&gt; 1 tail
Level 2 -&gt; 2 tails
Level 4 -&gt; 3 tails
Level 6 -&gt; 4 tails
Level 8 -&gt; 5 tails
Level 10 -&gt; 6 tails
Level 12 -&gt; 7 tails
Level 14 -&gt; 8 tails
Level 16 -&gt; 9 tails


Once Ahri is level 18, fur turns gold, and gains a slight aura. Have Inari, whom Kitsune are messengers for, talk in place of Ezreal's onboard computer. And so on.

It's been pointed out that Ahri is a Kumiho and not a Kitsune. Which makes it easier. Just name the skin either 'Kitsune Ahri' or 'Inari's Messanger Ahri'.""",self,t5_2rfxx,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1hd60y/an_idea_for_ahris_ultimate_skin/

1375035328.0,1j85jn,Draven's New Passive: Almost useless,Aldo13,4990,3514,1095,"So I've played Draven. A lot. I mained him on release for quite some time and he's the champ I've used the 2nd most in ranked. I'm not the best Draven or the most knowledgable about Draven
His new passive sucks.

I get the idea behind it, and by the time mid to late game came around, I would have around 700 gold max from my passive. That was an ideal game and by the time I got that gold *I was already fed, so it made almost no impact.*

Others games where I do okay

I understand Riot wanted to hit his passive for laning (it was OP and it NEEDED it) but completely scrapping it for this was unnecessary.

The worst part is that Riot wanted to nerf his early game, but I could easily throw an axe every 2 attacks or even every attack when I juggled 2. Thats like having a 104 AD steroid that doesn't scale with crit. And they removed it in order to ""buff"" his late game with some extra gold. Not to mention that gold becomes useless after your build is done anyway (although that probably won't happen often).

My suggestion would be this:
Give him back his old passive

Now its damage is HALVED early game, allowing it to scale harder into late game (like Riot wanted).

I think they and the level-req on T3 should be removed for two reasons.

1. They are a waste of IP when you get to level 20
2. Level 1's with full rune pages can't happen since rune slots are already gated by levels.

edit below:

Alright

Another way would be to make runes scale but I don't think it's a great idea since that either makes the rune really cheap at level 30 or really expensive at level 1.

So

Runes should also be removed from the shop when you have the maximum amount of them. (Preferably with a already-own-the-max-amount-checkbox) ",self,t5_2rfxx,1374840214.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1j1f2o/remove_tier_1_and_2_runes_completely/
1360481025.0,188l1m,It never gets easier.,SlurpeeMoney,3264,1794,201,"It never gets easier. 

Teemo doesn’t feel the blade as it pierces his body, bits of viscera dripping from its length. He didn’t see her coming, and now he’s going to die.

Again.

He knows it. He can feel it already, impotent panic. He’s felt it a thousand times before, and he remembers each time vividly. Dying is not the sort of thing you forget. Stabbings, shootings, arcane lightning, the white-hot burning of a turret’s ether, the searing pain of Baron Nashor’s acid breath… He’s died a thousand deaths

It never gets easier. 

Every time, she’ll play him that healing song she knows. He might have a potion; he doesn’t have a potion; why doesn’t he have a potion? 

He lies in the grass, the water flows crimson with his life’s blood, and he marvels at the way it clouds and swirls before his vision slowly darkens and he finally lets go.

It never ends there. 

Out in the world, it never ends with death. That was the old way, when brothers and sisters would kill one another over a petty land squabble. That was war. Here, death is a matter of inconvenience. It’s a penalty for poor strategy, for being unprepared. A single champion might die a dozen times over the course of a conflict, and no one bats an eyelash. 

The conflict has run a long time. The ancient magics that hold him to the service of his summoner grow weaker as the battle rages on. They take longer and longer to pull him back from the brink of void. His consciousness hovers, every time, that this is the time they won’t bring him back. That all-consuming, instinctual terror of death seems to last forever. 

Without warning, a bit of dizziness, but he doesn’t have time to think. Ahead of him, he can see Fiora piercing a half-dozen minions, pushing relentlessly towards the first turret, and that requires the whole of his attention. 

He runs

He can’t avoid death forever.

It’s a reality of the arena.

And it never gets easier.

Adding new ""subitems"" for various starting options.

for example:

**Short Sword** : 4 AD 180gold|                     


2x **Short Sword** +40g builds into 1x **Long Sword**



**Fragment of a Ruby Crystal**: 200g +70 Health|




2x **Fragments** + 75g builds into  **Ruby Crystal**



think you all get the point
same for Amplyfing tome

**of course

this would open up an incredible amounts of starting possibilities

you could start short sword + fragment + 3 pots for example
or whatever u desiere.

just an idea :P


EDIT: For those who think this will ""delete dorans as starting items"":

Dorans ARENT starting items at all
You buy dorans to get a HUGE early game boost when u get Firstblood or similiar things or if you need some backup for mana reg or whatever.

THOSE ITEMS are ment for the start:
If you just want more AD without having to start without wards/pots or similar situations




Edit2:

Only thing I want to be added
So no Price changes

PS: excuse me for my bad english :/

Examples
* **Short Sword**
* **Amplifying Page**
* **Cotton Shirt/Armor**
* **Ruby Shard**
* **Sapphire Shard**
* **Magic Muffler/Hood**
* **Knife**

Pretty self explanatory. A guy in chat says ""i play Maokai as a tree"" we understood that he was going jungle in some way, like you see in the pictures, and stood there till 15:00 That is when the rock ulted him and made him run.

No, he bought 2 items and then ran to the red buff and just went willy nilly all over the place.

**I will not say his name, judging at his match history.

And at the start of the game he said ""Hi this is SIV HD

Oh and no, but he just said it for copying SIV HD, like most people do.

Seemed like he was drunk or something like that, that is what drinking does to you. Don't drink alcohol kids, or you might get banned.

**TL;DR:** Don't play while drunk

No hard feelings

I talked to him after that and added to my friend list to help him out later, but thats not the point.

Is this community really that rotten that we are gonna bully new players for shit like that? I mean, not for competitive play, you are gonna win anyway, you are gonna get 71-0-11 with your khazix (u soooo guuud), why are you making another person (real person, he exists outside your screen too) feel bad (he doesn't know the community. He probably don't have thick skin for that level of toxicity)?

Damn, but DAMN I'm pissed now.

* [The average number of games per day is 864000.](http://www.riotgames.com/news/riot-games-celebrates-end-league-legends-season-one-registered-players-surpass-15-million-over) So

EDIT: Wow! I didn't expect this post to get as popular as it has. Here are some more:

* Draft Pick (banning 6 and no repetition on either side) would give you a possible **9,446,164,120** (quadrillions) of possible games. primerion pointed out that if I included the bans as possible unique choices then the number would come out to **5,089,954,010,192

* I'm using combinations and permutations for my maths. For Normals it would be 108! / (5! * 103!).

* The next new champion that Riot releases will create another **1,706,730,465** (quadrillion/million billion) new possible games.

-The First Law of League: As an enemy Garen remains MIA

--Schrodinger's Corollary: If Garen is not visible on the map, Garen is simultaneously both in and NOT in the brush.

-The Second Law of League: A champion must obey all orders given to it by a summoner

-The Third Law of League: A player choosing an unconventional role / build / character on the enemy team will carry his or her team to victory. The same player with the same role / build / character on your team will be 0/13 by the end of laning phase.

--Shaco's Corollary: The performance of a friendly Shaco is inversely proportional to the performance of the enemy Shaco. Or

-The Fourth Law of League: Any player saying ""mid or feed"" will do both.

-The Fifth Law of League: If there is a Teemo present on either side when a team fight begins

-The Sixth Law of League: Any action is worth the result as long as one types ""WORTH"" into all-chat afterwards. [DLSev] 

--Doublelift's Corollary: Only the first calling of ""WORTH"" dictates worth. All other callings are subsequently nullified.

-The Seventh Law of League: Winning or losing is secondary to having both teams understand who is to blame

--ELOH Corollary: It is statistically impossible for you to be the cause

----ELOH Corollary 2: The first ally to notify his or her team that the game is lost by entering 'gg' nullifies the LP loss

-The Eighth Law of League: When a mistake is made

-The Ninth Law of League: Any time the enemy team will engage a powerful neutral monster

--Smite's Corollary: In the event your jungler does have smite available for dragon

-The Tenth Law of League: Any spell with a substantial cooldown that would be critical to winning a fight will come off cooldown approximately 2 seconds after your death. [DownvotesAllYourShit &amp; Trophaeum]

--Death Defied's Corollary: If playing Karthus

-The Eleventh Law of League: Responsibility for failure is inversely proportional to farm priority. Everything is the jungler's fault

-The Twelfth Law of League: If all five members of your team are playing roles and champions they generally enjoy

-Lane Victory Exclusion Principle: If one or more of your teams lanes win their lanes

-Hecarim Uncertainty Principle: It is impossible to know where Hecarim is and how fast he is moving simultaneously. [SamIAm1223]

First check http://www.lolsummoners.com/ladder/euw/2
That will give you an idea of just how many people are currently in Diamond 1 on 100 points now with 0 incentive to play solo q.

Why is it 0 incentive? Because when we win we get +0 when we lose we lose LP and then fall out of the ""Queue"" for promotion series

I understand that challenger is for the very very best but currently challenger tier is for the first 50 people to rush through the ladder and get promoted and diamond 1 is for the people who have the ability but weren't fast enough.

And as a side note I appreciate the attention the rioters and generally everyone in this thread have provided as I understand that I am in a very small percentage of the player base and unless you are a pro it's normally hard to get messages out so Thanks

1374959393.0,1j6hjl,Riot should team up with Twitch and create a Twitch Twitch skin,Jrrj15,3639,2206,507,"Create a Twitch Twitch skin. I figured it would be a cool idea like how Smite created the Ymir twitch skin for people who streamed Smite.

He could wear a robe with the Twitch logo and Twitch colors on it. All his poison marks could be purple and when he has max stacks on his target instead of the crossbones it could be the Twitch logo above their head.

Abilities:

Q~ He could disappear into a puff of purple smoke.

W~ Throws a purple substance instead of a green one.

E~ Pretty much the same thing that normally happens except purple also if 
the mark of the Twitch logo is above their head it explodes with a little cool animation.

R~ The Twitch logo could appear over Twitch for a short second then disappears and his bolts turn into Purple bolts of lightning.

I'm a terrible artist so i'm not going to draw this but if someone would like to that would be awesome!
I just got this idea today while playing Twitch for the first time. Thoughts?


The comments on the last post had tons of great ideas like the poison marks being Twitch emoticons like Kappa and also ideas for special Twitch related jokes.

Reposted because the mods deleted the last post.

+ Finding a manager that is a pro player or ex-pro player that could bring some great experience as well as potentially be able to attract some top talent
+ Pubstars do not necessarily make a good 5s team
+ Talk to existing teams (LCS and non LCS) to be able to find what their current structure is
+ Have multiple paid (but not as much) teams / a ""farm league"" like sports teams do to source new talent
+ Possibly not a ""house"" to be able to go overseas for the non-US teams (not my favorite idea yet)
+ Reach out to some non-organization bound teams that already have a great image: Cloud9 and Square Duck
+ Build on a well-established team - what would users like to see, tutorials, guides, riot-integrated webapps, ???)
+ Host a big tournament with cash prizes
+ Documentary TV series of up and coming players
+ Contest for all-expense paid trip to visit and hangout with the team/go to a tournament

If you are 0/3 after two ganks and you haven't seen your jungle in a while, I'll still drop a ward for you now and then, but turtle up, farm or go roam mid, something besides pushing and yelling at me. 

Take a second, mid is 3/0 and the jungle is currently 0/0/6. You don't need to start crying about another lost game yet.

Let's say you go 0/4 because you decided you're the best and will make your comeback because of your L337 skillz and push your lane to the enemy tower. When the enemy top laner who has 3 kills on you already is standing behind his tower spamming laugh

After the inevitable wrecking don't spam ping your tower that has a quarter life expecting someone to abandon their lane or an easy gank for a futile situation. When they get there the enemy will be gone as will the tower. That would be the bad decision that loses the game, take my wolves, get some items, contribute to teamfights.

If the chatlog is full of ""nice gank!"", bad jungle no ganks."" You sound immature and foolish.

This is the same pull that I think a lot of pro players feel - they want to come up with the thing that completely changes the game

In LoL, it has very specific boundaries that can't really change. Nobody has sent Annie to bot lane. Nobody has tried playing no Jungler. The greatest thing that I believe has happened was Dignitas's famous ""protect the Kog'maw comp"" with an AP soraka mid and a Mundo jungle.

What happened to that team comp? Riot nerfed it into the ground. What happened when we saw a focus on global ults? Riot nerfed them. What happened when people realised you should max W on Ezreal and it's great? Riot nerfed it. I understand why they nerfed them

As I see it, each ability should do, and how they should be used. When they are usable outside of these roles, these possibilities are taken away in some form. By now I'm sure you all can see where I'm going with this: Riot, how you believe a champion should work and how they do in reality are allowed to be 2 different things, and if you see a champion being played in places you didn't foresee ( e.g. AP mid Soraka, Lulu everywhere) you really shouldn't see this as a bad thing. No

When Terrans in SC2 realised that Blue Flame Hellions were a big deal, but they kept them usable. Today (as far as I know) Hellions are still perfectly usable and a great unit. Is AP Soraka viable? is mid Lulu? probably not. I expect the same thing to happen to AP Rengar in a few weeks.

So what's the solution? It's actually kind of simple. Don't be so quick to swing the nerf bat. That's all. If something is being played a lot, that's what you'd expect because it actually is broken. Nerfing Malphite because he beats the bruisers that he is supposed to beat and has a good teamfight presence is not OK. I am certain that AP Soraka wasn't OP. I am certain that AP Janna wasn't OP. I am certain that AP Rengar isn't OP. Nerfing those was/is a mistake, because they remove the choice for innovation.

If AP Soraka beat every other AP after like a month of collecting stats


Thanks for reading this and I hope you take this into account in the future.

TL;DR: Don't nerf something when it is played differently to how it was intended

PS: Don't adopt this policy until after Season 2 is over

""i think riot should fix lux's e and gragas' q to insta pop upon reaching it's location **if the spell was activated again whilst in flight.**

players with higher ping find it extremely difficult to successfully pop these spells instantly and use them effectively

this is a relatively simple fix that probably has been mentioned before and i fail to see why people with higher ping are put at an even bigger disadvantage because of this

Curse plays to win. Our number one goal was to finish in the top two teams in order to achieve a first round bye in the LCS first season split. From our perspective, you would know that we are an intense group, sometimes to a fault, with a reputation for working and preparing for games exceptionally hard.
 
In this particular case, for example, teams who have secured their spot in the playoffs will often rest starters, try different plays and compositions in order to better prepare for the upcoming playoffs. For us, nothing is more important than winning when it counts.

1349751262.0,116cm2,Season 2 Finals personal experience: ocelote.,oceloteWorld,3705,2315,868,"Hey guys. Ocelote here from the hotel.

Ill be sincere letting you know that reading all the stuff im reading thru these days is making me not feel comfortable.
Community is missunderstanding everything quite a bit

Some of us work hard, talk about and even practice in a daily basis... And then? The catastrophe happens. Internet issues, discussions about some teams cheating, rumours surrounding us.... All this, killing the purpose of reaching professionalism. And all this, in the S2 Grand Finals. Disaster.

Im in eSports for quite long already, and thats why Ill give my honest oppinion about this topic:

1. First of all, amateur or even casual ones.
2. No company put in practice the ideas Riot is bringing until now. Let's Open our eyes for a moment, Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers stadiums (NBA) are hosted. Near by Los Angeles Convention Center...
3. So much on the line.
5million prizepool year? Probably multiplied for Season3?
We are living a dream
4. The meta changes however the community wants to. As one of the most important reasons buffs/nerfs and changes are done is the feedback from the community.

When it comes down to this event:

1. Proplayers got treated extremely well. Before, good meals, cabs/shuttles, tickets to visit fun stuff, rioters taking care of us, chance to practice before playdays... Im pretty sure every professional competitor will agree with me on this one.
2. Remember when internet went down? Me, not at all, Riot's fault. There was literally nothing Riot could have done better. But that's something Riot will never say. That's not the way they handle things. And that's definitely something laudable.
3. Remembering when internet went down again, gaveout stuff and entertained the crowd however they could. (props aswell to every shoutcaster that was casting by then) Deman, Jatt, DJWheat; not counting Phreak, Rivington and Rachel.

About cheating:

1. Cant really blame players for using their senses in a moment when everything is on the line. (implying iG probably did it versus us). Nobody cant say ""I wouldnt do it"", where you just want to win. 
Im not defending them, sometimes you can't even control yourself.
Lemme put it this way
He knows it's bad, everything is engaged in a different way.
2. Riot commited the mistake of making able that to happen, for sure.

All these points are meaning that we should really lend a hand right now. Have patience

Grand Finals are soon

Im not gonna be playing there, as the respect for this sport and my opponents keep me here. So no, Im not gonna take the early flight and Im gonna make sure I enjoy one of the best shows in eSports, ever.

See you there.

You could have an EU

""welcome to summoners rift"" could be said by Phreak. 

In the time between the welcome and the announcement of minions   spawning you could have Rivington ask who wants to see team red win with a simulated audience cheer and kobe could ask who wants to see blue team win with the same fan fair. 

As the game progresses you could have recorded lines for towers falling

Basically this addition could make your average solo queue game feel like an LCS match and would be great with replays coming out soon as you'd have a bit of mini commentary built in! 

Feel free to chime in with other ideas and of course riot pls. 

TLDR: riot could make a mint off  LCS announcer packs. 

Edit: wow I never expected my idea would gather so much feedback thanks to everyone who has tossed in their ideas and let's hope the money people at riot see this :D",self,t5_2rfxx,1365011610.0,,dignitas,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1bl0tc/lcs_caster_announcer_packs/

Let's say the current botlane meta divides into two sub-metas: 

* **Aggressive** kill oriented/poke lineups 
(Support preferably with CC

* **Passive** farm oriented/sustain lineups 
(Support preferably with sustain

Now speaking of Support summoner spells, to make the killing easier. 
But what about a farm lineup? 
Exhaust and heal are the defensive options

Imagine a sustain/farm setup, the only additional gold gain on support are his gp10 items and runes. He's doing a damn good job, by keeping ADC safe and sound, but a well played kill lane support will have his additional gold from assists, whereas a passive support has nothing to compensate the gold and *build* difference. 

How about we make CV a viable passive support pick

I love the idea of making CV a viable Support summoner spell

**EDIT**: Bonus gp10 OFF CD means early game you wouldn't use it as much, that has majority of vision on the map, and CV would be the summoner spell that should compensate this.

**EDIT 2** I will sum up other CV enhancement ideas that were mentioned here &amp; in previous thread. I assume that two CV balancing threads in two consequent days mean that people actually like the idea of bringing that rusty summoner spell back into the meta. 

**EDIT 3** **Bolding** the most poplar sugestions. 

* Flat passive gp10

* **Gives assists if enemy is killed with vision granted by CV**

* **True vision (including wards)**

* Stealth detection

* Isn't visible to the enemy team

* % bonus XP gained

* **Merge it into a new *On use* item**

* Flat bonus stats (armor

* AOE buff/debuff when used in teamfights

* +Gold on spotting enemy

* +Gold on cast

* Increased gold on assists

* Lingering vision leaves a debuff that grants bonus gold on kill

* Longer CD,False,self,t5_2rfxx,1365196587.0,,tpa,t3_1bqhis

1367849840.0,1dsjww,Why isn't there a Division 2 planned?,Zankman,2709,1327,607,"Quite simple

Right now, how bad the promotion tournament is (flawed, rather) and so on.

One of the more common topics is ""If these amateur teams keep disbanding because they can't play in the LCS, compete but at the end of the day they simply won't be able to stay with the elite."" 

The obvious question is - why not have LCS Division 1 and 2? 

Both could have 8 teams. The Div 1 teams would fight for the top prizes and places in World Championships

Instead of having weak, which would make more sense and would certainly be more fair - and exciting. 

""Amateur"" teams would fight for Div 2, but when and if they *do* get to Div 1, we would know that they are ""worthy"". 

Obviously, regular and competitive *professional* environment to practice, develop and grow in. It would help elevate dozens of teams *and* the league(s) itself. 

The **issue** with this is obviously a possible over-saturation in competitive content (I personally wouldn't mind, an increase in expenses. 

So

Would they cast all Div 2 games?

What would be the prizes? 

How many teams would be promoted to Div 1 (and how many would be relegated to Div 2) at the end of each split?

So, however, I'm feeling like it is **necessary**.
