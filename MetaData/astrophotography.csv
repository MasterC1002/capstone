For examples

* /r/Fitness 

* /r/Coffee

* Photography: http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/photography

Topics could include:

* Starting equipment for Astrophotography

* How to stack photos

* The difference between 30x 1sec exposures and a 1x 30sec exposure

* A checklist for deep sky objects

There have been some terrific explanations in the past

Even a list for 'Best of M31/42' would be neat.

Some time ago

So...presenting the [New FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/wiki/index)!  Ta-Da...or something.

The FAQ will be implemented with Reddit's new Wiki system

The immediate changes you'll notice:

* The [Useful Astrophotography Stuff](http://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/wiki/useful_astrophotography_stuff) list that used to inhabit the main index page of the Wiki now has it's own page

* The [Wiki Index page](http://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/wiki/index) now contains the initial FAQ

* The button at the top of the page that used to say ""Wiki"" now says ""FAQ"".  Focus groups show that users prefer links be labeled what they are.

---

I also want to say a few words about a couple of community members who've agreed to give some of their time and energy to helping expand the FAQ over time.  

/u/PixinsightFTW and /u/spastrophoto have graciously agreed to help manage and develop content going forward.  Long time /r/astrophotography  members will immediately recognize those two users as some of our top contributors of absolutely **stunning** content.  They bring a great deal of knowledge and experience to the table

Please be sure to thank them, just a collection of random internet nerds who like spacey stuff...try not to hassle them with your latest script for a new James Bond film, ok?  ;)

---

If you have any suggestions for FAQ content

And finally, make use of the ""Talk"" feature at the top of each FAQ page...that's what it's there for!

Those videos are also a great time killer while waiting for your exposures to finish ;-).

---------------------------

**Beginner**

---------------------

*You don't own a telescope? Simply do your first astrophotos with your DSLR camera and borrow somebody's basic tripod. It really works!*

**Edit:** *This also explains the principle of light-

- [Video: Astrophotography without a star tracker (Just a DSLR and tripod)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0JSTF8SGi4)

-----------------------------

*You just got your first telescope on an equatorial mount to do astrophotography and have no clue how to set up the mount?*

- [Video: How to Align an Equatorial Mount](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plx6XXDgf2E)

**Intermediate**

-----------------------------

*You own a basic telescope but you've never thought of connecting your camera to it before? Help is here!*

- [Video: Attaching an SLR camera to your Newtonian Telescope](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYTmsfpL0M4)

- [Video: Attaching an SLR camera to a Cassegrain (Part of a video about how to photograph the moon)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSvPaQIwQ4A)

- [Video: Different methods of attaching a camera explained (Contains ads/product placement by Celestron)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJZxI6fD0wE)

----------------------

*You shot your first astrophotos and something seems to be wrong with the telescope? You can somehow never get it into the right focus? Don't worry - the small variantions that you could not see while observing visually are usually first seen when taking a photo. How do you fix this?*

- [Video: Collimating your Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope in just a few minutes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqRVIDj4aZA)

- [Video: Collimating a Newtonian Telescope](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1asF3m2Mh0)


--------------------

*You want to take a picture of the sun? Great idea

- [Video: Safe Solar Viewing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxnK7MGYIA)

*All the special terms are confusing you? AltAz? Equatorial? These tutorials will explain the basics of telescopes and telescope mounts and all the typical terms.*

- [Video: Astrophotography P2: Choosing &amp; Using Telescope Mounts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQB6UnrTEEM)

**Advanced**

*So you took your first photo. What's a very fast and easy way to process it in Photoshop?*

*All the advanced astrophotographers are talking about ""guided"" and ""unguided"" photos. What does it mean? Or are you already thinking about getting an autoguider?*

1368567544.0,1ecax0,[MOD POST] - Introducing the /r/Astrophotography Top 50 Challenge,EorEquis,45,1,33,"Greetings and salutations

The Top 50 is a list of 50 objects that can be imaged using various techniques and equipment that we discuss here every day.  (See below for download links for copies of the list)

The list was put together as something of a ""kitbash"" from several sources online and in print.  Heavy consideration was also given to targets that are particularly popular here in /r/astrophotography.

* The targets range from very easily imaged to extremely challenging.  
* There is a rough balance of targets best suited for the Northern hemisphere
* There are targets best imaged at every different part of the year.
* There are DSOs

The point of the list is very simple...it is designed to present every member of our community, or experience, a chance to chase down several seasons' worth of exciting and enjoyable shots. 

This isn't a contest.  It's not about who takes the ""best"" image of so-and-so target, or try new methods, or maybe return to an old target you haven't shot in years.

Now

* Image 15 of the top 50
* 25 is Silver
* 35 is Gold, all get you a month of Reddit Gold from yours truly. :)
* Anyone who happens to image all 50 will receive ""Platinum Flair"" and will win the subreddit. ;)

---

A few housekeeping details:

* There is a new imgur account, viewers can see everyone's M42, or everything /u/JoeImager has shot.
* ""Submit"" images as you always have.  Simply start a post with the image and acquisition details as always.  Just PM me afterwards with a note that you want this image included in your APSubreddit imgur gallery.
* YOU are responsible for keeping track of your list and what you've shot.  I ain't keepin' 7k spreadsheets over here.  ***lol***  When you reach a ""level""
* Obviously, we ask that everyone submit images taken and processed starting TODAY, rather than knock off a quick 15 old images just for a piece of flair. :)
* If anyone would like to contribute a version of the list ina  different format/spreadsheet platform
* This post will soon be linked in the sidebar

**Download The List**

We hope this will be a fun adventure for both our active imagers as well as lurkers who ""just look at pictures"".  Somewhere down the line

1359742927.0,17pg7v,My advice for anyone who wants to start in the wonderful world of astrophotography ,Fogboundturtle,42,1,28,"You can do some pretty amazing thing with an limited amount of gear but this is a help guide for someone who wants to move from the 30sec unguided setup to imaging for hours in Narrowband.

**1. Learn the sky before**
Learning the sky is a very very important skill when you want to do astrophography. There is night where your GOTO (assuming you got one) will not cooperate. Finding target once the camera is already place in the focuser and focus perfectly. you need to rely on your finder or finding scope to frame your target. 

**2. Get the best mount you can.**
If you can

**3. Go monochrome CCD**
don't be afraid. It sounds like a daunting task but its not harder. You can do so much more with a monochrome CCD camera. Some camera like the Atik with Sony sensor camera requires no darks. That makes the capturing process shorter.

**4. Don't underestimate the importance of a good focuser.**
If you telescope doesn't have a smooth 0:1 dual speed focuser. Its a great investment. Focus is hard at it is to achieve. You want a focuser that will allow you to dial precisely. Motorize focuser is even beter.

**5. Test everything in daytime the first time**
You want to setup your setup in daytime prior to attempting at night. You want to make sure the camera, filterwheel is all responding prior to trying it the first time.

**6. Don't worry if you fail at first.**
It a pretty steep learning curve. Everyone goes through that at first. Success is measure of previous failure.

**7. Save up
Better gear just work better. Its make the whole process easier and you will get better result faster. This could be the difference between continuing and quitting.

**8. Start with a shorter focal length telescope (wider field of view)**
this goes without saying. The wider the FL of the telescope

**9. Processing is 9/10 of the work**
Processing is a big part of Astrophotography. You could spend more hours stacking/processing then actually capturing photons. You may want to learn MaximDL/PixeInsight or Photoshop.

1376228989.0,1k563k,[MOD POST] : New Posting Guideline #1 - Appropriate Submissions.,EorEquis,42,12,6,"Hi gang

It appears /r/astrophotography has lost some of its direction of late.  A larger and larger number of submissions have ""skirted the fringes"" of true astrophotography

The number of reported links

As a result

&gt; Astrophotography refers to images of astronomical objects or phenomena exclusively.  Images and discussions posted in /r/astrophotography should have, or the topic of imaging them.

Here is some further clarification of this guideline :

Astronomical objects or phenomena include, nebulae, satellites (natural or manmade), planets, moons, meteor(ite)s and meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses

These **do not** include weather phenomena (sprites, images that focus on a terrestrial object *as the main subject* but happen to have a starry or dark background (/r/ExposurePorn, /r/photography, or /r/itookapicture might all be better places for those), or questions about ""What is this thing in the background of my image?"" (/r/Astronomy  might be better for these)

We are NOT...let me say this again

The point here is that the central topic, discussion about taking the picture, or just general fellowship with other APers is fine.

We're approaching 10k subscribers, and on to more, as a community that offers breathtaking and informative, **but highly topical**, content.

1356884641.0,15odbs,Cataloging your images in Google Sky,EorEquis,31,4,6,"So this morning I stumbled across a new way to catalog my astro-images.  

Obviously this isn't ""new"" as in never existed before, so i figured I'd share.  If this is old news to you, please forgive the duplication, and/or offer improvements or tweaks to my idea!  :)

[Google Earth](http://www.google.com/earth/index.html) comes with its own version of Google Sky, Google Earth.

One of those features is the ability to import .KMZ files, and scaling/orientation information.

Turns out that if you plate solve your image at [Astrometry.net](http://nova.astrometry.net), an image.kmz file which you can download and import into Google Sky.

Once you've done the import

[Here's NGC 6992](http://i.imgur.com/QO0u7.jpg) in Google Sky originally.  And here it is with [my image overlayed](http://i.imgur.com/NLsY1.jpg).  

You can create separate folders for your images by type, and begin building a catalog of your own images inside a virtual planetarium.  :)
