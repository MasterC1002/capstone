1374155151.0,1ik3ni,Tips for getting hired.,dontbthatguy,45,7,27,"A lot of people come to this sub looking for career advice

1. Get in a position to apply. Many municipalities have requrements. GED/diploma


GED/diploma is an easy one. I mean c'mon man if you don't have a diploma pull a Billy Madison and go back to school. 

EMT is a requirement on many applications. Even if it says EMT needed at application

CPAT is self-explanatory

FF1/FF2 is in my opinion the last thing to worry about. It's fun to volunteer and is great for experience

2. Take every damn test around.

I don't care if you only want a big city, ""I'm not a smart man."" But what happened was I started to see the same written tests WORD FOR WORD! And with repetition I got better at them. Also I started getting much better at oral boards which come later. I was set to even travel for tests with friends that wanted to get hired. 

3. Pay attention and fill out your application fully and neatly. 

My cousin applied to my department and couldn't hand it in so I did it for him. For shits and giggles I thumbed through it to see if it was complete and sure enough it wasn't! Are you kidding me?! This could be the career of your life and you botched the god damned application?! Also Pro tip: Photo copy the filled out application because when it comes time to fill out a different application all the information you need will be right there. (A lot of times they ask for references and I always forgot peoples addresses and numbers so having a photocopy of my last app always helped)

4. Time for the written. Take it seriously.

You can google written test tips. I can't offer much here I always scored in the 80's to start and after taking a few tests, 'cause they really weren't my forte. 

5. The oral boards

This really is a post in itself and we should probably do a oral board thread for tips, what is your favorite color, ect. Prepare for it! Write out your answers, then turn them into bullet points you want to hit. Then rehearse. In front of a mirror, or in front of friends. My college roommate and I used to just constantly bounce oral board question off each other. It will help. Get a suit. Don't show up unless you are dressed for the occasion or you will look like a moron. Also bring resumes. Even if they cannot accept them, you look like a champ waking in with some resumes prepared to give out. Relax and realize the guys across the table have sat in the same seat you are in. They want to see you do good. Also you deserve to be there. You made it that far so be confident. Again this subject deserves a post in its self so hopefully we can make that happen soon. 

Lastly

Some of you friends may get hired after the first test

Some other things I wanted to say, call the HR department of the city. They are usually very helpful. 

That is all I can think of for now ladies and gents. I hope that helps someone out there. Sorry for the wall of text

And sorry for any typo's. again I am not a smart man...

First edit: They all say number 1 because they are all IMPORTANT! Nah I have no idea why that happened. I swear I wrote 1, 4, 5 for the tips but what ev.",,False,self,t5_2ray9,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/1ik3ni/tips_for_getting_hired/

fire started inside the local chemical plant and in a blink of an eye it  exploded into massive flames. The alarm went out to all the fire  departments for miles around. When the volunteer fire fighters appeared on the scene,000 to the fire department that brings them out intact."" 

But the roaring flames held the firefighters off.   Soon more fire departments had to be called in as the situation became   desperate. As the firemen arrived

From a distance, that little run-down fire engine roared right past all the  newer sleek engines that were parked outside the plant. Without even slowing down, it drove straight into the middle of the inferno. Outside, the other firemen watched as the Hackberry old timers jumped off right in the middle of the fire and fought it back on all sides. It was a  performance and effort never seen before. Within a short time, the Cajun old timers had extinguished the fire and  had saved the secret formulas. 

The grateful chemical company president  announced that for such a superhuman feat he was upping the reward to  $200, asking the chief, ""What are you going to with all that money?""

In a way I am writing this post to simply get things off of my chest

Today's call started off like any other call for our FD.  It's that time of the year that a lot of us rural volunteer departments love to hate, but, that's when I heard what a lot dread.  Turns out this was no ordinary brush fire.  It was a brush fire that was caused from a structure igniting.  The home was abandoned and the surrounding area overgrown.  So, I knew shit was getting real.

Fast forward to the scene.  We had managed to knock the fire out

After a few intense hours of worry our assistant chief reported in on his condition.  He suffered a fracture in his C2, and chest.  

I'm sure some of us have had men down

My wife and I moved into our apartment when this complex was completed early last year. We feel safe because the building is up to the latest standards for security, and is restricted to senior citizens.

Recently an overloaded circuit ignited a fire in one of the third-floor units. It was almost midnight when the alarms sounded

Many residents are physically challenged — some wheel-chair dependent

A full evacuation was mandated

The men and women of these departments went to each unit to ensure that all were out and safe. Many people needed to be carried

Pretty much on a first name basis with them. Saved my mom's life more times than I can count by quick smart thinking.

My gripe is with guys that walk around like they are the shit and think they are better than everyone else and usually aren't able to back it up with skills and experience. 

Don't get me wrong I like a little cockiness (confidence) and swagger. We do a job people aren't willing to do and that's great. But don't walk around and look down on people. 

Here's why. I was working with a guy my age from a volly dept. He had a slight disability causing guys to not want to pair up with him. I didn't mind, but the guys on his volly department made fun of him for it.

I told him to tell who ever made fun of him for that to go fuck themselves. 

When a new guy comes on

I guess what I am trying to say is I know there are a lot of young guys here and that's great. I am one as well. When new guys come or guys with little experience come around, or interior certified doesn't give you the ability to walk around like a king and make fun of guys you think you are better than, that's bullshit. Leave that shit at home. Instead be proud. When a new guy isn't picking up the skills as quick, work with him, train with him. I am sure when you first started there was something you sucked at. The brotherhood is earned, but that doesn't mean you have to cast out new guys because you think you are better than them. Make them feel welcome. The time to act cocky and nock someone down a peg or two is when the guy fresh out of FF1 thinks he knows it all. That's when a little tough love to get him back in line is warranted. 

I know I rambled on a bit here

All I am trying to say is if you are a firefighter

There.  I’d like it to be known that the headline of this article was pretty hard to write.  The fire service, most of it not.  I’ve routinely thought that I was in the “justified” group when it came to my “fire ego”.  I read more than anyone else I know, I’m always thinking up new ways to train, and then going to do it. I run a damn BLOG on the INTERNET.

I’m what I’ve heard referred to as a 4-10.  That’s someone with 4 years on the job who acts like he’s been here 10.  And damnit if it doesn’t hurt to say that.  The (not)shocking truth is

I’ve been in this weird position for the past year or so where I felt like I figured out what I DON’T know

We were training at a class A burn building – basically a concrete structure with big barrels full of hay and wood that get set on fire, and there’s a chance that it might wind up segueing into another, yet related article where I attempt to justify my complacency, but we’ll see.

For the first few evolutions, which is very similar to herding cats at some points.  One of my firefighters tended to either ignore my orders or just absolutely refuse to do something then go off and do his own thing.  As aggravating as it was, I didn’t have much control over the situation (which brings us to the “I’m a bad leader” part of the story.)

So after dealing with this guy most of the day, gotcha. Oh wait, he didn’t tell us to grab tools or anything and now we’re all sitting over here by the door doing nothing.  Did I do the right thing and say “Hey, we need tools!”? No.  I was too wrapped up in the fact that I couldn’t get him to listen to me earlier in the day that I was going to let him flop on his own with no help from me to “see how it feels”.  I’m apparently really vindictive at times.  Of course, after the evolution was complete, it turned into a complete shitstorm focused mainly on the RIT team and our inability to really do anything at all besides stand outside and play grabass. But hey, I wasn’t the leader, reasons

 

Holy shit.  Did those things actually come out of my mouth?  Did I really just justify why I let my team fail by using spite as a reason?  Did I really just say that and IDLH atmosphere complete with fire was SAFE and UNREALISTIC?

The shameful truth is, I absolutely would.

I LET MY TEAM FAIL ON PURPOSE TO PROVE A POINT

As I’m sitting here writing this, sure, some hay in a barrel is no where close to a real structure fire.  That’s an actual fact.  But it doesn’t change anything.  I’ve always been about giving 100% in training and studying in order to make myself a better firefighter, but it caught up with me and I had a 12-year-old temper tantrum melt down that could have possibly gotten someone injured.

I’m changing this.  I’m going to do my damnedest to make sure that I never let myself get to this position ever again.  It’s unacceptable in every way possible.  It wasn’t the ass-chewing that made me open my eyes

And here’s my final thought on the whole situation – it’s statistically impossible that I’m the only one out there who is going or has gone through this.  In the words of the famous street poet Ice Cube

So what’s next for me?  Leadership classes.  I need to learn how to lead.  I need to re-learn how to be part of a team

And this was the hardest post that I have ever written (there’s that ego again.)",self,t5_2ray9,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/1dj5ca/im_a_terrible_firefighter_and_a_terrible_leader/

The severity of what happened yesterday afternoon didn't really sink in until the last few minutes before arriving on scene. If I'm out the door quick enough

Things started to get interesting when an ambulance tore past myself and the urban fire truck in the same direction. I didn't make our tanker this time

Then I noticed the very large, promptly throwing my gear on. Helped where ever I could. Urban Firies were extinguishing the truck which was well alight as well as a few other volunteers from a neighboring brigade whilst we supplied water and other small stuff.

Didn't take much notice of the debris on the road until the adrenaline wore off a bit whilst I was asking our officer for something

I'll spare the more gruesome detail and I hope I haven't bored or annoyed anyone with this reflection. I just want to get this out there amongst fellow firefighters and not bottle it up, for all of the bad stuff that the pager dishes up, a sense of pride and reward is felt for being able to be there at the worst of times to help restore normality as best you can to those desperately in need.

They say 'firsts' stick with you. First fire, and I would say something like this definitely will. Don't bottle things up. Do talk to your fellow firefighters. Do take up counseling. It does help.

1375628124.0,1jojv9,Let's talk about RIT training,CptnKickass,21,1,14,"What's gonna happen if one of our brothers or sisters goes down in a fire? Everyone always says, but let's be honest

We've been doing this training every shift, and 2. I'm paranoid about posting personally identifiable information on the internet. Sorry.

Ok. Let's start from the beginning.

My Lt and I are inside a building fighting fire. A burning truss falls out of the roof, and he's a 240 pound 5 foot 8 inches guy. So with his gear and BA, I'm looking at 300 pounds of dead weight that just hit the floor. What do you do?

First thing's first, he's not. Things to check include his mask seal, do you hear air leaking from his face piece, how much air does he have, is there something on top of him you'll need help or equipment to get off of him, is there anything impeding you from dragging him. Next thing to do is call a mayday. There's a few important things to think about here. When we take our PASS tags to IC at an incident, it's got our individual names on there. I know most places preach to not ever use names on the radio, do it. The IC needs to know who specifically went down, there's still clues that can be very useful to the RIT guys coming to help you. Are you on a carpet floor? A tile floor? Did the last door you went through swing towards you, or does the vaulted ceiling fade away into the smoke? If you tell me you're in a room with carpeted floors and you swung the door in to the room you're in now

So you've radio'ed your mayday, but it has carpeted floors, and I swung the door into the room to get in here. He's got 2,000 pounds of air left, but his face piece is cracked.""**. It's **very important** to tell them ""**I'll be attempting rescue**"" versus ""**I'll be finding a safe place in the room to await rescue**."" That will give RIT and IC enough to get an idea of where to find you. **Now** that you've given your radio report, activate your PASS alarms on both your and the downed firefighter's pack. Giving a radio report with a blaring PASS in the background is a son of a bitch.

If he's got a flashlight, stretch him out to the largest profile possible. Regardless of if you're performing the rescue, or you're waiting on additional man power, you can go ahead and put him in an SCBA harness. An SCBA harness follows these specific steps:

1. Grab the waist band of the SCBA. Do not let go

2. Slide your hands back to the middle and unbuckle the waist strap.

3. Run one strap through the middle of the downed firefighter's legs

This will give you a make shift harness, you can run the handle diagonally from his shoulder strap to that waist strap and have a make shift way to lift and carry the downed firefighter.

Let's say there's a window you can get to, and if not, make sure you know what you're about to drop your guy onto. Next, consider ways to get your guy out the window. Have a pike pole or a sheet rock puller? You can hook the working end of the tool on the window sill and set the handle on the ground, creating a make shift ramp. Slide the center of the downed firefighter's body (face down) as much onto the tool as possible, then pick up the handle and use the tool as a fulcrum to slide him out the window. It'll be uncomfortable, but it works if they're too heavy for you to just pick up. You may just be able to slide them to the window, put them face down and head towards the window. You want to start by grabbing under the shoulders, body shaped like an L, they will bend out of the window rather than bend back into the building.

Let's say you're in a residential single story single family house, to kick through some sheet rock into an adjoining room. And any firefighter worth just about anything can fit between those two studs. If you kick through and find a room on the other side, look for an exterior door or window. If you find a hard wall you can't get through, you know you've likely got an exterior wall without any windows or anything. See if you can make a purchase hole with an axe or halligan in the wall, so that guys outside might find it and cut or break the wall open for you to egress through.

Next

* Get comfy on the floor. You're going to want to move as little as possible. Slow your breathing as much as consciously possible.
* Take your pack off
* Turn your air off at the bottle. Take slow half-breaths, and repeat. 

My Lt waits until I've been working out and am dog ass tired, and has me do this to see how long I could make it last. I've gotten 18 minutes out of it.

Last thing I want to bring up in this post is ladders. Forget everything NFPA/NPQ/IFSAC taught you about throwing ladders

For extension ladders, the bedded length is 14 feet, and each ""click"" is 14 inches. When approaching a building, the butt man should always be in charge of ladder placement. As you approach, size up your height and any overhead obstructions. How tall are you? I'm 6 feet tall. If I stood against that wall, it would take a little over 2 of me to reach that window. I'll call it 15 feet off the ground. My butt needs to be about 1/4^th the height of where I'm going. So my butt needs to be about 4 feet off the building. Bam, thrown down my butt once, and for every 2 feet of distance from the building to the butt, right where I need it to be. Too short? Yank it up another click. Too long? Grab the butt and pull it away from the building. It's better to come out too tall than too short. Too far to the left or right? Roll that bitch. Stand to the side, they can take a beating.

Sorry for the wall of text, take it to your station and train with it. Please feel free to throw in and contribute your own thoughts/experiences/methods here, if nothing else, I'd like to take them back to my crew to train with.",,False,self,False,t3_1jojv9

 I've been involved with my local volunteer department for around 6 months. Not that long, so obviously she has been involved in my life longer than firefighting has. It is something that I have always wanted to get involved in however, due to my previous job, I was out of town a lot.

 I absolutely LOVE being involved with the department, the next meeting night (Tuesdays) we are arguing over it again. I try to see her side of the argument, that it interferes with family time, but I can only see it as her being selfish. I have my training/business meetings once a week in the evenings, and the occasional calls that I am able to make outside of my work schedule. I would love to get her involved with the department so she can understand things better, but she has no desire to do so. I can however understand that she herself is busy as well. My wife is a full time college student, works part time, and I'm thinking this MAY be where her issue is with me taking off to the department. Its not like the balance is largely off Kilt

I've been a member of the Fire Service for just about three years; in that time, many hours on the highway.

Two weekends ago, it was the remains of the barn)

It was big

Allow me to Tarantino it a bit

Our Deputy chief had laid into the beers after we wrapped it up (around 4:30) and continued to do so all the way up until we went out for supper at a local restaurant (8:30-9:30ish)

One of our lieutenants was driving the now quite-intoxicated deputy chief home

Myself

[Also worth note; the fire was visible from our station

There

When our captain tried to get our Deputy to stop sending foam to the line

We attacked the fire

Our chief then arrived on scene. Our captain pointed out our deputy

From there

Our Deputy was then being ridiculously belligerent

At this point in time

I say our own safety because;

1- It was clear that the chief had no control over the scene anymore
2- The deputy chief was still prevalent on the radio
3- Our chief failed to make the steps necessary to ensure his crew's safety.

 
I will own up to walking off a scene; that was ill-advised. But at the moment

After we had left the scene (The heresay I received, was also drunk.)

Today

I don't think the residents of my county are safe with the current chief and deputy; they actively condone drinking on the fire scene

I want to know what I can do to get an investigation done into the matter.

My lieutenant and captain were also dismissed.

**TL;DR:** Drunk Deputy Chief on scene. Chief refuses to remove him. Deputy runs pump - fire fighter gets injured. My crew dismissed from the department for walking off of the scene.

1357516617.0,1635oo,Why I became a Firefighter...,spacitymedic,23,7,77,"When joined the fire department in 2011

When my house burned on a year that my dad hadn't paid our dues, filled their trucks, charged the lines, and then checked to see if we were on the roster. We weren't. That night, I watched my father stand at the end of the driveway, tears pouring down his face, illuminated by the glow of the 2000 square foot bonfire. I watched the only home I knew go up in smoke because the firefighters refused to help. And I never respected a firefighter after that.

That is

I had been an EMT since 2007 and didn't feel like I was doing enough by working in the emergency department at Local Hospital. So my friend Jason suggested that I see about becoming a first responder. I went down to the station on their meeting night and ran into my friend who introduced me to Chief. He was excited to have an EMT who was eager to participate and answer medical calls in the area

Uhm...no. I'm not a firefighter, I received my radio and my trauma bag. I was given an o2 tank and all the airway supplies I would need for any sort of respiratory or cardiac call. I was ready to go.

That night after the meeting

Quickly, and then began dispatching drivers to the trucks. Jason was his go-to-guy since he lived so close to station 2. Everyone had their routine and everyone stuck to protocol. It was organized and structured. No one just jumped on lights and sirens and broke the speed limit. There was no confusion as to what your job was because everyone followed their leader. When Chief spoke, everyone listened.

Jason was told to pick up the Brush Truck 3 and get a size up on the fire. My heart was racing, and carefully, but quickly, made our way to the fire. The way the inside of the cab was illuminated with red and filled with the piercing whine of the siren made me sweat. I didn't really know what to expect. The last fire I had ever seen took away from me everything a 4 year old would hold dear, aside from family. I just sort of fell into this situation and there was no way I could have prepared mentally for it.

When we arrived

I, watching flames creep up the sides and tops of heavy brush and crunchy June leaves. My mouth open, and eyes wide, I was slightly frozen there in the midst of so much chaos. Bystanders were gathering to watch Engine 3 roll up and attach to the hydrant. Cars were slowing down at the intersection to rubberneck at the scene. So much was going on all at once and I had no idea what to do.

""Desiree! Desiree!, he marched headlong into the fire, blasting the brush with a full fog. It crackled and popped. Some of it roared. I stood there, pulling the hose off the reel and walking it down towards him, keeping as far a distance as possible from anything that looked hot, smokey, red, or just plain dirty. 

The thought of a propane tank no less than 30 feet away from me scared me to death, I would later realize. 

That night, either. Not untouchable noblemen who wore medals everyday and marched to the sound of Glory Glory Hallelujah. 

These ordinary men

Now, you have to prove yourself. You have to show up early and leave late. You have to do the dirty work. And not only do it, you have to do it without being asked. You have to go that extra mile, roll a hundred hoses, cook a few meals and wash a few dozen turnouts. You have to clean up what's not yours and take a little bit of crap from the guys around you. What's more- you have to dish out too. And that's just around the firehouse. 

When it really hits the fan, and God forbid, carry theirs too. You have to be that hand on their back and swallow any fear you have. Keep it down deep in your gut till it's over because the love you have for your brothers every day... is greater than the fear you have right now. 

I earned my place. And looking back at that first fire

Together we have been through a lot. We have buried one of our own in 2012. The heaviest weight I will carry is not the casket, for which I am forever in their debt. ""Thank you"" simply won't cut it. So, today, I write to tell you about the men who changed my way of thinking. How they proved themselves to be exactly nothing like what I thought. And how I decided I wanted to be like them, more than anything in the world.

God Bless all my Firefighter Brothers and Sisters. Be safe. Trust each other. And fight the good fight. I love you.

Unfortunately I decided to follow the poor directions on the popcorn package tonight and chaos soon ensued. It said to place 1/4 cup of oil in a pot along with one kernel of popcorn, I noticed the pot started to smoke so I removed the lid and then BAM: the hot oil had been craving oxygen so up she went up in flames as soon as I removed the lid. In a panic, I did the worst thing ever and picked up the pot and tried to blow out the flame. Boom! Mega fireball in the kitchen as beard hair, eyebrow hair, eyelid hair all got singed. At this point, having received a fireball in the face, I decided to drop the still flaming pot while I looked for a cloth to put over it. This did the trick and the fire was out. 

Anyway

So to you firefighters out there

Dispatch tells us that the Key Holder lives across the street and is on scene. We get on scene and I assume command. There was another Captain driving the Tank that said we should just check the panel and reset it and go home. I said

So

I hear this all the time on the radio. Crews showing up and checking the panel then clearing. It defeats the purpose of the fire alarm in my opinion.

What does everyone think? Do you have any examples that I can take back for training that shows the benefit of checking the building?

1362350635.0,19ln7b,Wildland firefighting summer 2013 application questions.,PatagoniaBound,13,0,6,"Hey all

About me:  I graduated last summer from college with a BS degree in Biology.  I took environmental coursework/labwork and was also a teaching assistant for an ecology lab.  I recently found out about wildland firefighting and was immediately intrigued.  I've been reading up all about it and figured it is something I REALLY want to do!

I have some questions about requirements and the application process and would really appreciate if anyone could help me out.

1. I know it's late in the season for applications (USAJobs position closing is 3/29) how stiff will competition be? 

2. What rank would I qualify for?  I see a GS-05 requires a college degree and some training like the S-290 course.  Is it possible to attain these after application and before the position start date or must they be completed before application?

3. I'll be applying through the USAJobs website
