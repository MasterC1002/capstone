You get $100

The game will run 3 months

No stocks can be bought for less than $2.  (this prevents someone from putting all $100

All symbols and markets are open to be played.

Each trade will cost a $10 commission.

Selling on the margin is disabled

You can not trade in partial shares (must purchase in full share increments).

The password is:  **narwhalbacon**



The more people play the more fun this is

I personally know very little about the stock market, it is quite educational.  It can be as complicated and time consuming as you want to make it, we used to have guys who would flat out day-trade the game, and others who made a few purchases and then let it ride for the whole game.

The AmA will be running for a couple of days to ensure no one missed out.


I apologize in advance if this sort of information is not welcome in this sub; if so


Cheers!

Well, it actually ""smiles"" because there is fear of upside movement. 

We're seeing that right now in the oil market. $OVX has gone from a low of 25 from late last year to 44.15. That means the options market is expecting a monthly percentage move of about 12.75%. To get that number

So I think this is a bit of a fade. Yes, very strong move in USO probably won't happen.

What are your methods? Do you know a good way to do that on an Android device and on the go?

Please post your ideas!

I've given this topic some thought and here's what I've been using so far:

* Youtube daily market updates/review/etc. Search YT for these keywords and set time filter to 'today' and you will see a really small list of users who post such stuff. Unfortunately mostly it's only related to forex. I can use it on the go through YT Android app however which is a big plus.

* Bloomberg app. Not very useful since the amount of news is staggering and their stories are very long. I usually end up reading the headings.

* RSS feeds. One Polish portal has brief analysis/commentary section to which you can subscribe. And RSS can be easily picked up on mobile devices... Unfortunately I haven't found an English equivalent.

* BBC Business News. I can read it on mobile

* FT and WSJ app. Most news are locked though and their apps are of questionable quality.

I'm a kind of a person that likes to have everything in one place. As you can see my situation now is to flick between several apps which is no fun really.

Can a non-billionaire either avoid loss or even profit from these ""wildly inappropriate"" prices?",bunabhucan,48,18,38,"It seems like the argument is that short term volatility should not have a bearing on long term (years and years) price predictions.

Do we see these ""wildly inappropriate values"" in warrants or LEAPs or is it just in the 15-20 year put options sold by Berkshire (as described on [page 16 of the 2007 annual report [PDF]](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2007ar/2007ar.pdf))

[exact quote from 2010 annual report [PDF]

&gt;**Both Charlie and I believe that Black-Scholes produces wildly inappropriate values when applied to long-dated options.** We set out one absurd example in these pages two years ago. More tangibly

&gt;We continue
accused of shoddy accounting if we deviated from it. Moreover

&gt;Part of the appeal of Black-Scholes to auditors and regulators is that it produces a precise number. Charlie and I can’t supply one of those. We believe the true liability of our contracts to be far lower than that calculated by Black-Scholes, or for Berkshire Hathaway itself. Our inability to pinpoint a number doesn’t
bother us: We would rather be approximately right than precisely wrong.

The ""absurd example"" is on [page 20 of the 2008 annual report [PDF]](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2008ar/2008ar.pdf)

&gt;So let’s postulate that we sell a 100- year $1 billion put option on the S&amp;P 500 at a strike price of 903 (the index’s level on 12/31/08). Using the implied volatility assumption for long-dated contracts that we do

&gt;To judge the rationality of that premium
2% inflation it will be worth roughly 14¢). So that will be a factor pushing the stated value of the index higher. Far more important, the Dow-Jones Industrial Average increased by about
175-fold


&gt;Considering everything
occur – is 50%. Under these assumptions

&gt;But if we had received our theoretical premium of $2.5 million up front
Let’s look at my example from a worst-case standpoint. Remember that 99% of the time we would pay nothing if my assumptions are correct. But even in the worst case among the remaining 1% of possibilities – that
is

&gt;The ridiculous premium that Black-Scholes dictates in my extreme example is caused by the inclusion of volatility in the formula and by the fact that volatility is determined by how much stocks have moved around
in some past period of days, getting a quote every day on a farm from a manic-depressive neighbor and then using the volatility calculated from these changing quotes as an important ingredient in an equation that predicts a probability-weighted range of values for the farm a century from now.)

In hedge funds though when they charge their 2% management fee and 20% on gains how do they fund these fees? Do they collect these fees at the end of the fund or do they sell some of their holdings at the end of each year to collect their fees?

I'm assuming most people responding will understand the premise of how the Accredited Investor standard applies/works. Essentially

There are a few problems I see with the standard:

(1) Wealth is an poor proxy for sophistication - For example Lady Gaga, on the basis that they haven't had 2 years of $200k+ income, unless there's some special exemption for them that i'm missing here?)

(2) I get the argument that these wealthy people can afford to hire investment advisors and so they can basically ""buy sophistication"" by hiring someone. But even most lay people can hire an investment advisor of some kind and besides

(3) $1MM is a very low number that leaves in a lot of people that are not going to be very financially sophisticated (on average) such as late career doctors and lawyers.

(4) We have many financial certifications (and other practices such as Law and Medicine) that require the passing of tests to demonstrate ample sophistication to practice

It also occurs to me that the standard probably contributes, by preventing the ""poor"" from having access to the earning mechanisms of the ""wealthy.""

Just stumbled on this via the chrome web app store and thought it was quite cool. It basically offers a system that takes the available financials on a publicly traded company and gives you a fundamental ananlysis. 

Pros:

* Clean and simple interface
* On-screen explanations of metrics
* A comprehensive FAQ
* Free

Cons:

* Only covers 4 exchanges (NASDAQ, TSX)
* Only provides information on companies with 5+ years of financial records
* Does not take into account possible gaps in records for valuations given to stocks
* Only uses a limited amount of metrics for its valuation

I'm a sophomore in college and got my first finance related internship this semester. This is my third week. I'm supposed to work until December and I'm not getting paid (just compensated for lunch and transportation).

The problem is that it's not really related to finance and it's basically a sales role at an analytics company. And I really suck at sales with English not being my first language and just being a shy person in general. I basically get yelled at every day. I'm pretty sure the company REALLY needed interns and that's why I got an offer. I don't really like the people in my office

More information on the company: it is an outsourced analytics company. All research work is done in India and no one in the NYC office does research.

What I do: I make cold sales calls

Since this was the first offer I got

I really wanted to quit, keeps telling me that she'll be in a difficult position if I quit. And she promised me that she will put me in contact with different people if I do well (she used to work in IBD). I'm afraid she might talk bad about me to her contacts if I quit. Since I don't have any relevant work experience, I need something on my resume too.

But every day it's just frustrating because I feel like I'm not improving at all and I keep getting yelled at. I'm sure sales skills are probably a good thing to have

Since I only have two more months

**TL;DR:** Sophomore majoring in finance doing sales internship. Job sucks and I'm not learning a lot. Boss who used to be in IBD says she can put me in contact with people if I do well. I don't have work experience. Should I stick with the job until I get done in December?

Since there seems to be a lot of ""im in school and need guidance/help"" posts

I started undergrad at Stetson university as an international business major. After a difficult conversation with my neighbor (M&amp;A Lawyer) about how this degree will help me I decided to switch to finance (Sophomore year). Sophomore year I really wasn't ""following the markets."" I wasn't into finance because; a) the coursework was fairly mundane and b) I didn't know the scope of what I could do within the industry (from I-Banking to VC to being a broker to Investment Management to trading). 

That summer I started to tentatively follow the markets during my study abroad in Austria. 

I came back Junior year with a fresh appetite for learning the material and really applied myself

I started applying aggressively to all the bulge bracket bank websites for internships in August/September of 2007 (keep the time frame in mind as it is important). I didnt, 3 interview total; 1 behavioral 1 technical/current event 1 getting to know management (ie you have it in the bag). 

**Bolded because I cannot emphasize this enough -- without this internship I would never ever ever ever be in the position I am in now. I can comfortably place 100% of my relative success on this internship.**

I did very well during my internship

Senior year I got my first taste of the buyside with my experience in a student managed endowment class. 10 sutdents about $13 million of capital and buy/hold/sell reports every half quarter on any equity (first semester). Same set up except on debt securities second semester. All around an incredible experience and actually gave me selling experience/research experience/valuation experience and a feel for what I would be doing in the real world. This course made it onto my resume because of how amazing it was. 

I did a 13 month mating dance with the bank I interned for

Finally

**What I Do**

I basically oversee money from institutions/pension funds. We specialize in liquidity events and developing balanced portfolios while delivering alpha (yeah

My job:

Basically follow the news. Look at everything from geopolitical (we've been super busy with Egypt, equity &amp; debt, or derivatives. Its a fun job and I get to work relatively sane hours (5.30a - 6.30/7p -- weekends if I want, not really req'd since markets aren't open). 

My daily routine:
This is basically what I did in Miami and what I imagine LA will be like.
4a - Swim for 30 minutes
5.30a - get into office -- read news, emails etc
6.30a - watch how we open
6.40a - 1230p - debate ideas with MD, put on trades (if we do anything that day), research, work on my own models and team models.
1p - watch the close
1.01p - pee for the first time all day since 6.30
1.05p - 4.30 work on models
4.30 - 6.30 - meetings (if none day will end at 4.30)
7p - gym
9p - dinner

Salary;

I make less than 80k base and more than 50k base. Bonus will probably be based partly on performance and be part discretionary (i'm hoping around 20k -- pretty low actually). 

I know I'm probably missing a lot of stuff so ask away

This group is extremely competitive but I managed to make it to the final round of interviews last year (approximately 15 of the 45 or so that apply).  At that point I had to make a stock pitch for Chevron.   I feel like I should mention that I'm a finance major and that I've done some investing in equities with my dad when I was younger (around 13 or 14 years old).  He just ran me through the very basics though.

Back to the story, ROA, dividend payout, free cash flow, etc, as well as a few liquidity ratios.  I also examined some intangible things such as Chevron getting access to an important drilling area near Russia and the fact that the dollar was depreciating at the time

I feel like I had very little confidence as to what was most crucial to look at before I started preparing

So I guess my question is, some it's just examine the graphs, the business structure of the company, or even just take a look at the business's competitors and determine if the company's shares are currently incorrectly priced.  Or is that how it really is, and everyone has their own opinions on what is best to look at?

I'm interested in asset management and I'd like to start investing on my own as well, which can be done without CAPM honestly.  Like what do Morningstar and Bloomberg and YahooFinance look at when they give out their analysis on equities?

First and foremost, and different jobs.  It has made sense for me, for multiple reasons, to have a national bank that offers excellent online services due to me not really being grounded in a specific location.  

I, I was getting tired of big banks and their bullshit.  I made it a point to go to BofA and see what the hell was going on.

Here is what the new fee is:

* $5.00 fee per month if debit card used
* Fee not implemented if you use debit card to withdraw cash
* Fee not implemented if checking account has a minimum balance of $5

The BofA representative was very adamant in stressing the fact that it is not a $5.00 fee for having a checking account.  Please also keep in mind that all big national banks are now going to be doing this as well starting 1/2012.

For me

* I maintain the checking limit
* I use credit cards for everything and pay them off monthly (builds points

That being said

* If you are grounded in a specific area
* If you are looking for national banks
    
    Charles Schwab
    
    Ally
   
    ING
    
    USAA

The four banks above offer free online checking.  They can do so because they are not heavy on brick and mortar locations.  My suggestion would be USAA.  If you are military, you still have access to their checking.  This is a pretty good kept secret that not a lot of people know about.  If I did switch banks, it would be to USAA.  Online banks also reimburse ATM fees, including the hefty ones found at strip clubs or bars.

So there you have it.  I hope this helps clear the air about what is happening with big banks and gives you some alternatives to look at.  Keep in mind that it is not advantageous to banks like BofA to give you free checking on an account that has $127.50.  Really

1) Integrate with wordpress

2) Add a blog section where I list daily articles from various sources

3) Run a weekly spotlight on one independent blog (after all

4)Eventually... develop this into something like jockspin

1365182040.0,1bqsvn,Does increased regulation increase the cost of lending? Why?,StupidQuestionAsker,40,20,13,"Hi


I'm working on a presentation on banking regulation and I came across this article that states that the cost of lending increases with increased regulation. 


Here's the quote I'm confused about. 


*INSEAD Professor of Banking and Finance Jean Dermine cautions some of the proposed regulations are going too far. In a new white paper entitled ""Banking regulations after the global financial crisis, the new banking regulations threaten to keep too much money in the vaults and not enough in the economy. ""This is an overreaction,"" Dermine told INSEAD Knowledge, ""because we should not forget that banks are extremely useful in the real economy, to finance lending to consumers and small and medium-sized companies. If you come with stringent regulations, **the cost of lending is going to go up tremendously**. The cost of bank loans to small firms will increase.""*


Can anyone kindly explain why the cost of lending would increase? I'm guessing it's because since banks would be required to keep more in reserves


So


But how is this a cost to the bank? Is it that less in the quantity of loans (which would be an asset to the bank) means less earnings?


I'm confused. Please help.

Abstract: If one is looking to cash out investments all at once before 59.5 years of age

Example: Home interest payments ensure that you'll be in the 15% income tax bracket for the next 10 years.  You take the money you would have invested in 401k and instead purchase the fund/investments directly yourself that the 401k plan would purchase.  You make purchases of the investments every month.  When it comes time to sell, not single status) you bump up into the 33% income tax bracket, and the lump-sum sale of 401k is now 3% more costly to you than if you had bought your own stock from the beginning... except there are some unaccounted for factors:

- When purchasing stock directly
EDIT: quick search shows $10 per trade on Etrade.  So $120 per year... only $1200 over 10 years.  The 3% is going to tower over that $1200 after 10 years!
- what else might I be missing that would cut into the greater profits that appear to be available using the ""buy your own method"" ?

1) Obviously no one is going to offer downside protection without requiring compensation

2) What exactly are the tax advantages?  From what I've read, all else equal.  So what exactly is the advantage here?  Are the gains also tax-free on the back-end?  How can you extract these gains before death?

3) Similar to #2, how is this different than investing all your money in a traditional portfolio and extracting money from it as you need it for other investment opportunities?

4) My understanding of insurance is limited to the perspective from investment theory.  Basically that, fees, etc. ever change and if you refuse to pay the higher costs can your plan be canceled?

Treat informal interviews like a formal interview. You cannot be over prepared for an interview. 

The interview went very well. I met him in his office. We talked for over an hour. He introduced me to the VP I would be working under if I accept the offer. 

Oh top of this job I also got interviews from several commercial banks and investment banks (1 bb and 3 middle-market). 

So I will be very business the next few weeks. haha

I am honest quite shocked by the amount of the interviews I am receiving

A few months ago I met and got to know the SVP in the corporate banking department of one of the big 4 banks. Evidently I impressed him some how

I am not too familiar with informal interviews. Does this mean that I have a fast track to this position since it is a position he overlooks?

I've interviewed for a few shitty data-entry positions with some local firms in varying industries for the summer (not many people want to take a chance on a sophomore with a 3.1) and I'm waiting to hear back.

EV = Mkt. Cap + Debt - Cash

(Of course, and ""cash"" all cash-equivalent holdings.) 

Now here's my question. Imagine a company that has 0 debt. As that company's amount of cash on hand increases relative to its market cap, if there was a company that had zero debt and had somehow accumulated cash equivalent to its market cap, then its enterprise value would be 0. But a company with no debt and lots of cash should be worth *more* because of those factors, shouldn't it?

I see why debt and liabilities must be added in the formula, I don't see why you still subtract cash. 

Wikipedia seems to say that it's because you'd have to pay out that cash as a dividend to the people whose shares you're buying. But why would you? Or is it that you subtract the cash from the ""market cap"" price tag because you could use the cash to buy the equity? But still

1) For really no reason at all since my second year in college I've harbored an unusual interest in how to value common stocks, then options, then REITS, and so on. 


2) The only books I've read since high school are the Intelligent Investor, The Snowball Effect, Security Analysis 1962 ed (like half, that shit is huge), The Essays of Warren E. Buffet, etc. 


3) Warren Buffet is my motherfucking hero (with Munger as his kickass sidekick). 


4) The only income I've ever had was a high school job at Round Table Pizza


5) Finding companies with high ROE, P/E ratios literally gives me a boner (alright just figuratively)


6) I don't even care what I'm ultimately paid as long as I can sift through balance sheets all day and have enough money left over after living expenses to allocate some capitol of my own.




So what I ask of you r/finance is: Am I just a starry-eyed noob who's romanticizing finance because I haven't had any true exposure to the industry yet? Or should I stop dicking around and DO something about it? CFA level 1? Am I even qualified to search for internships?

I'm new to the finance scene. I have a batchlors degree in computer science from a very reputed college and I was working in CISCO. Currently I'm working at a start-up company(having strong tie ups with SAP AG) that does data mining and analytics on Big Data. I'm really good at coding, probability and stats exams. I won't say that I'm perfect though. I have my fundamentals in economic theories strong. I'm a ""partially-trained-newbie"" when it comes to finance though. 

I have been wanting to move into Finance

But recently I came across MSCF program at CMU and similar programs in colleges like Columbia, MIT, BU etc. When I looked at the program structure, I thought this has the perfect mix of CS and Finance and Math. I felt that this is what I have been looking for... Oooh...also I wrote GRE quite recent and got 170/170 in quants and 154/170 in verbal and 4.5/6 in Analytical writing...

Bell would go around and find state employees who were nearing their pension retirement. Maybe one or two years out from their retirement, which cities pay what portion of the pension seemed to be based on a formula as to how long the worker worked in that city.

So, I might work 28 years in (random city, CA). Then, Bell offers me 3x my salary, and I clearly go to Bell. Two years later, I obviously retire, and Bell gets the benefit of me living in their city and paying city taxes on my pension

So who ends up paying? Well

Was Bell raping their own city's residents by overpaying me? No, it's a great idea. Yeah, for two years you pay a huge salary, but if the people retire in your city, you collect taxes for the next 30 years on their wildly inflated pension.

I'm not really sure how to formulate this question, and I'm not even 100% sure how the models work in practice (i.e. constant volatility in the models is clearly presumptuous, constant rehedging to delta hedge in the face of transaction costs seems difficult).

But, does the Treasury yield curve ensure that there is no bond market arbitrage as there could be under some bond pricing models, and if the yield curves are based on market information, how does the market ensure that those bond prices do not allow for arbitrage?

Maybe more importantly

Perhaps I'm confused or just missing something obvious

Any insight is appreciated

EDIT:  A FOLLOW UP:

So I see that due to pretty simple reactions, to take advantage of.  So here is my question about the current market:

If stock markets and the market for Treasuries have to interact in a way that does not allow individuals from take advantage of risk free interest rates that would allow them to take a position in assets and lend cash in a way that allows for arbitrage (or at least react to each other fast enough to close it quickly), come about to influence the opportunity for arbitrage and/or the market?  Wouldn't institutional investors, having knowledge of how the two markets interact, have enough information about (at least directionally) where yield curves are going, which would allow them to more accurately value options, and potentially take advantage of that situation?

I understand so far (I Guess). But then in the Total Columns on the right, and divides it by the Discount rate. (Discount rate is 10%, so effectively making it 10 fold).

The average investor believes the 2000 and 2008 and 2011 declines are/were temporary, 2006, 2001, and 2010. A level which is measured in inflating dollars. Accounting for inflation we are at where we were in the early 90s and late 80s.

In recessions, or already knew, holding cash is just as bad of an investment. They will then turn to hedges against inflation, real assets, further devaluing the dollar. They will turn to commodities and energy the only things in the past decade besides entrepreneurial investments which have increased in value. Meanwhile, the fed *has* to print more money to account for the deflation of the recession, less they risk their debt becoming more expensive to pay off...further devaluing the dollar. Two fundamental forces acting on the increase in the value of assets. And there is a reciprocating effect, as usual in the end of the fractional reserve banking cycle. The same thing happened in 1979 when silver prices were $100/oz and in 1938. And pretty much every 30-50 years since fractional reserve banking was first used (TMK) in the 13th century.

There is a notion in the investment community that gold and silver are the next big tulip crazes, the *only* way out is real assets. Last one out is a rotten egg, and will be spending the rest of their lives regaining their lost value.

Firstly a little bit of background, for example imagine river networks where the main river has tributaries which in turn have smaller tributaries which themselves have smaller tributaries (and so on...). What he attempts to do in this book is apply this theory to financial markets. 

In the book Mandlesbrot sets out to portray two key points; that price charts are self similar and that prices don't vary in the conventionally assumed random manner.

The price charts point is fairly obvious to anyone who has been following financial markets for any reasonable length of time. Take away the time axis of a chart and you could really be looking at any time period. It is the second point that made me think and that led me to write this review

What Mandlebrot basically says is that the widely held view that price varies randomly on a trade-by-trade basis is incorrect. If this did happen then a 5% fall in price today should have no effect on how the price changes tomorrow. What actually happens is that volatility clusters so when there is a big shock on any given day then the following days are more likely to experience price changes of that magnitude (direction isn't quite so predictable unfortunately). This again may seem fairly obvious to people following the market but theoretical models such as Black-Scholes and CAPM use the concept that price follows this random motion. If the stocks actually followed a gaussian distribution then the price should not vary as much as it does in real life. This gives us undervalued expectations of risk. 

In the book he suggests that price changes actually follow a power law. This results in the fact that a big change in price one day leads to a higher probability of a big change the next day as well. He states that different stocks obey power laws controlled by different powers. This means that some do move seemingly randomly in a gaussian distribution but others move much more wildly. It also means that if you were to try to predict a more wildly stock using a traditional method that you are likely to get caught out by large shocks. 

What do others here think of this? Is there a reason why incorrect theories are still so widely used? Does anyone work in finance and use his theories in a professional environment?

What I did not like about the book was the style Mandlebrot wrote it in. It come across that he is very bitter that few of his ideas really took off. He writes as though he is much smarter than you (which he obviously is) but that he is scolding you for having got it wrong for so many years. 

Overall I would recommend this book for someone interested in finance and maths however I would warn you that it is quite tough to finish. You pretty quickly get the jist of the book and then it is just endless examples of why he is right and everyone else is wrong.

So
123200 * .7 = 86240 (Equity)
Margin Loan is $36

Critical Price = (amt borrowed/#shares) / (1- Main. Margin)

So

Small amounts as in $500-$1000,,17,6,35,"I remember reading part of a book ""The 16% Solution"" about buying tax lien certificates as a way to get up to 16% interest on your money. Is this still a practical thing to do? It seemed like half of the strategy in this book was to buy liens against houses and therefore you had to scope out the property beforehand to make sure it was worth owning in case the debtor never paid

What I would really like is some kind of way to buy debt from a credit card/debt collection agency or some such other company that is in the business of controlling debt.
