A couple friends and I ""explored"" into this boat that's been grounded in an inlet in Vancouver. If you want to get more info on this boat, that's the best my phone can do. I'll update with better quality photos if I get them from my friends.

THE FULL STORY: We bought a $50 inflatable fishing boat and a 12 pack of beer

On the boat, we tried to break into the fridge. (Video 2) My guess is that the padlock on that door was put there after the boat was abandoned, as when we managed a peek into the fridge, it was mostly empty except for some tall leaning item that we could only get a glimpse of. I think something was hidden in there. We weren't able to do anything to the safe (found in Video 5) as it was pretty solid.

(The freaky ass shit part) The first friend that got in the boat, it was bizarrely comfortable with us being so close to it. Someone brought up how crows are real bad luck in some cultures. Now, referencing Video 6, my buddy has already dropped off the other two members of our party onto the beach as we were ready to leave. (it was almost 3AM) We chose to have a little more fun in the boat and did a little more wandering. We came across a door we hadn't noticed before. This door was completely different from the rest of the doors. It was bolted shut with plywood. Reference Video 3; at the 30 second mark, when I adjust the brightness level on my flashlight, I'm actually shining my light on the very door I'm talking about. I'm not really sure how we missed it. I noticed some of the drywall around it had been kicked in, trying to gain access to what was behind the door, so I decided to finished the job. I kicked in the drywall closer to the ground to find more drywall behind it. So I kicked at that to see how far I could get. Well, sounding exactly like the kicks I was just giving it from around the spot I was kicking it. Me and my buddy looked at eachother to make sure we both heard it. And then it did it again, and whatever was in there was confined to a space no larger the 15 square feet. Deciding we'd had enough and not wanting to be anywhere near that door any longer

I'm going back  very soon with a bolt cutter and a prybar. I will update when I come back.

In case you were wondering

NOTICE: This happened the night of April 31st, and I am the original poster. However I am lazy so here's the cut and paste from the post I've already made. This thread was also posted to the creepy subreddit, but was removed by a moderator. I was suggested to post it here.

EDIT: I realize that I break a few forum rules in this story. This thread was meant for the creepy subreddit.


EDIT:Everyone is going to hate me for this

I do promise to deliver though. I will without a doubt be back to that boat in August to deliver for you guys.

1372962034.0,1hnajo,I was chased by police when checking out an old pool building today,RaptorSitek,93,11,18,"So much andrenaline

Anyways, small tourism-centerd city, where old people can chill out and shit. I like how peaceful this place is, but it gets boring fast. I decided I'm going to scout around the old abandoned pool, and see if it's worth coming back with a camera. This is how the place looked few years ago, now there is a high fence all around the place:

http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8474/8116672243_1e00135333_b.jpg

(none of the photos here are mine btw

I parked my bike around 100 meters from the building

I jumped over the fence and went for the front doors, I seriously felt like I'm walking around some abandoned military institution in DayZ. 

http://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/79079216.jpg

I found some fairly new beer bottles and hooligan signs, and decided it's time to come back. Sadly, this is where I let my guard down, I was out in the clear and didn't notice the police car parked behind the fence. Someone probably noticed me when I was walking around the outdoor pool, and called the force. It wasn't until I reached the fence, when one of the police officers shouted.

It was probably a dumb idea, and took a sharp turn after I was sure they couldn't see me anymore. I had no idea what to do at first, so I just lied down in some bushes and decided to wait. After few minutes I heard some steps around 20 meters from me: they were still looking for me. That's when I realized staying in one place will just get me caught, and my only way out is, well, finding a way out of the complex. 
You see, there was a biggest working graduation tower in europe.

http://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/79078642.jpg

The one you see on the photo is open for tourists
I scouted the wall for any holes, but workers were walking on the path between me and the tower.
I had to time it well
Just when I heard steps closing in behind me, and was no more than 2 meters away from me. I power slided under the tower, and crawled to the other side in mud, with less than one meter of space between ground and ceiling. The creeking sounds the tower made were terrifying, it was claustrophobic and dirty, but I felt so fucking happy I couldnt give a single shit.

I went around the tower, when the police car I've seen before went right past me. If I didn't take off my dirty jacket after crawling under the tower, they would probably recognize me.

I got some pizza afterwards. Best. Day. Ever.

I know underground school tunnels aren't really urban


**TL;DR**
Some friends and i discovered unknown secret tunnels under our high school. Over weeks we discovered and mapped out a big part of the tunnel system. 


[WHOLE PHOTOALBUM](http://imgur.com/a/wCbdH)

I'm now 18 and only have memories and pictures to look back at. 
Last school year (2011/2012) I was an exchange student in USA, and started school. This happened exactly one year ago. 

It all started with a friend of mine (senior at the time) came to me and said he had something crazy to tell me. It was kind of a rush hour so i didn't have time to stop and listen. Later that day we met in lunch break and he told me that he had been in the schools maintenaince room and had seen a dark square (3x3 ft) in the wall down a staircase. He that it was some kind of underground tunnel system under the school. I thought he was stupid and didn't think much about it. 
Now in the school i attended for a year and the daily routine consisted of normal classes and a 9th hour/homeroom in the end of the day

I forgot all about his  little tunnel story and almost two weeks went by till we came by the subject again. I was sitting peacefully in 9th hour and doing my homework when i saw someone knocked on the door. I looked up and there was my friend
He wrote me a pass and I walked silently but determined out. Christian basically bombed me with the information that he had been ""in the tunnels"". I thought he was being crazy again and laughed at him

A few days later I couldn't help my curiosity. I had to see if this was true. In 9th hour I got a pass to go to the restroom and knowing I had limited time i rushed down the long hallways with a friend to the mechanical maintenance room. I quickly entered, down a staircase, down a ladder, into what seemed like a small pool around 7 ft deep, in the corner was a little square entering. I could barely spot it with my phone light. I crawled down and had a quick peek inside. After this i was eager to crawl in and look, but i had already been gone for 20 minutes, and i knew that would only cover for a long toilet visit, or when I did it

[Entering](http://imgur.com/a/wCbdH#M5Sg1EM)


The next day I couldn't wait for 9th hour. The day went by so slow and it seemed like forever till the class started. Thinking that the teacher wouldn't write me a pass if i asked to go to the restroom right after a 6 minutes break, ran down the stairs, down the ladder in to the pool and went in the tunnel. I had asked Christian to meet me there at 3:20. He showed up and told me that he actually didn't go in that hole, but in another path about 6 ft long that went into the basement in the other side of the room. 
I checked it out and it wasn't even a path
Everytime we took a right or left turn there were turns both ways, excitement and a crapload of dust and dirt in the air, it got really hard to breath in there, and we went out. Up in the normal school light we were sweaty, and covered with an orangy dust powder.

[Christian](http://i.imgur.com/pN9vCym.jpg)

We had to see more. But we needed to plan it out. We couldn't just go to the restroom every day and coming back looking like we attended World War II. Teachers would get suspicious, gloves, painting masks for dust, camera, change of clothing, blueprints and pencils. I managed to steal a whole block of passes so we could fake signatures and write passes to study hall, library or other teachers classrooms to cover up our actions.
Also we needed a different time to enter
We came up with bringing a mirror to look around the edges when we exited the room. 
In the school there was a red blueprint painting hanging in the wall. I took a snapshot of it and after 15 minutes with my enormously bad photoshop skills i made it black and white and printed some copies out. 

[Blueprint we drew on](http://i.imgur.com/b9EKbhe.jpg)

We were now ready to note every single little turn we explored under there. We also got two other friends involved

[We were PROJECT BELOWSCHOOL](http://i.imgur.com/f87aNSE.jpg)

Friday night there was a basketball game at the school. 
What a perfect opportunity. School was open and no one in the hallways. We packed bags from home. Once the game was on, a flashlight guy, a map writer and a camera guy at the end. We had also purchased 1000 ft of line that we tied somewhere in the maintenance room. and took with us in. It functioned as a kind of safety so we always could find our way out. After almost 2 hours in there. We went out. We had discovered endless turns and paths and about 700 ft of tunnel was mapped down. 

[Underground](http://i.imgur.com/RyDQacv.jpg)

The following fridays we planned to go down there again. We knew the routine, classrooms and and all the other rooms. I'm a big guy 6'4"", and i had quite some trouble crawling around down there. One of the times i was freaking out because I was running (as good as possible down there) and I got breathless because of the dust. After that I never did anything physical exhausting while in the tunnels. 

We went down there about four times and the last time was the most interesting. It was only me and Christian

[Hardees cup](http://i.imgur.com/andGS3I.jpg)

[Cans](http://i.imgur.com/DmrT9WM.jpg)

We continued and saw a yellow pipe running across the path. We spend about 5 minutes discussing what it was
We continued into a big wide space. The feeling of standing up for the first time in three hours was amazing. It was exactly under the staircase. There was a metal plate in the wall

[Under the staircase](http://i.imgur.com/0hM84eA.jpg)

[Metal plate 1](http://i.imgur.com/gkYteFf.jpg)

[Metal plate 2](http://i.imgur.com/HLApYWx.jpg)

We had found another entering. Unfortunately it was locked. We also looked up in a hole with a bunch some pipes and wires and discovered a bag of funions shoved up in there. How the heck did these come up there? We took a few pictures and took the 25 minute journey crawling all the way out. We jumped through the little hole to the basement and exit through there. No one saw us. Monday morning we went above ground of where we were on the friday. We looked down the thermostat of a radiator and concluded that the bag of funions were down there

[Bag of funions](http://i.imgur.com/iLvE1F4.jpg) 

The basketball season ended a few days after there.
Even though we talked a lot about going back
Later on we explored some abandoned buildings and train wagons, but I got my rush from them. We told a few people about it and showed them the pictures, but it's kind of forgotten to this day. Only my memories and pictures keeps this alive.

Here are the whole picture album. Unfortunately I didn't take enough photos
Iv'e decided to hide our identity since I haven't asked or have got their permission to post their faces. I am the guy with the blue gloves.

 Well, dead animal water. Deep water. As you progress further in, the edge gets smaller and smaller, and eventually you have to shimmy around large square columns that make you hold yourself above the water. Water that is 5 feet below you your feet.

  We do make it past the water seriousness with no issues and make it to the turbines and, but Gatsby drank half a back packs worth in about 2 hours. When we where ready to leave he was sloshed and there was nothing we could do but try and help him make it past the seriousness. 

  First couple of columns where fine and he handled it well. 4th column, one of which resulted in him landing on the ladder's top step directly on his back with his back-pack still on and I thought he was going to be paralyzed. Luckly he was fine.

  The struggle finally ended after 30 minutes when we took his back-pack from him and he was able to claw himself back on the ledge. He was soaked and dry heaving as we made our way out.

So yeah tldr: Friend fell in horrid water and thought we couldn't get him out.
