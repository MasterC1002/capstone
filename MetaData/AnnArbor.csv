We have decided it is time to close Tree Town Toys storefront.  Our lease is up at the end of the year and upon a review of the retail environment, and wanted to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of you for your support and patronage.  We have watched your kids grow over the last many years, and are honored and privileged to have been part of so many lives here in Ann Arbor.
 
This was a difficult decision for us, it becomes more of a challenge to find the time to do everything our businesses demand and still be there for our kids. Ultimately we decided that in order to prioritize our family, a tough business decision had to be made.  Our retail operation takes tremendous resources to operate at a level that we are satisfied with.  When we weighed our options we decided to close the Tree Town Toys retail store.  This allows us to focus on other business, Dragonfly Depot (http://dragonflydepot.com), which provides websites and order fulfillment for independent retailers and charitable organizations.  Most importantly, this allows us to focus on our family.

There are so many amazing people to thank. We’ll start with you – our customers.  We have come to know so many of you personally through Tree Town Toys.  Thank you for choosing to support local businesses like ours.  Thank you for letting us be a part of your family activities and your children’s growth.  Thank you for joining us for so many in-store activities.  Thank you for helping us create amazing events that have positively touched so many lives of people around the country and around the world.  We cherish the time you spent with us.  We consider ourselves to lucky to be part of the Ann Arbor and Detroit Metro communities.
 
To all of our staff and employees – current and past, played together, and celebrated together, and without all of you we would not have been able to do the amazing things we did.
 
To First Martin and Chris Grant

To all of the toy manufacturers and reps we’ve worked with over the years – and there are over 600 of you - thank you!  The last few years have brought some real turmoil to the toy industry

To our fellow toy store owners around the country - thank you for making the toy business special and for providing humor and insight when we needed it.  
 
We will honor gift cards in the storefront until we close and encourage customers to use them while they can.  Our website http://treetowntoys.com is operated by our other business

Thank you all!  Tree Town Toys wouldn’t have been the same without so many of you.

**Edit2:** So it looks like we have enough interest to something this week and/or next week. Let's schedule this to either appeal to the weekenders vs. the weekdayers.

Suggested Meet-up Locations/Events:

&gt;* The ann arbor comedy club would be a great non-bar meet-up as well and usually has 2-3 funny acts. Andy Pitz will be there the 17th-19th.


&gt;* A tribe called quest documentary is playing at the state theater this month [TBA].


&gt;* Bars! The Pig, the Blue Tractor, Old Town, ABC, Ashley's (Last times venue), Habana, the Blue Leprechaun, GT Charley's


&gt;* Babs' is a fav of mine. . .not sure how many people there would be so seating could be interesting.


&gt;* Espresso Royale also happens to have a ton of space and they're always hosting various other meetings


&gt;* Zap-Zone on Carpenter and proceed to play some laser tag.


&gt;* Hell Survivors paintball in Pinckney for a future meetup destination


I'm down for setting up a Meet-Up this weekend and/or next. How many ann arborites could do either or? Friday-Saturday are both available personally.

**Edit3:** I've posted in the comments for meet ups this week vs. next week. Up vote your preference and I'll tally them to see which week is best for the community and also to get any idea of est. attendee's for reservation purposes. Unless we want to flash mob lol.

**Edit4:**Aside from an ""official"" Meet-up I'm willing to set up plans if they are groups that can't attend an official large meet-up but would still like to do something in the mean time.

How my site was taken down in a web-washing attempt by false “hate crime” victim Justin Zatkoff  
By Mark | November 11
  

  I apologize for the interruption in service yesterday, it’s because [I wrote about Justin back in 2006](http://markmaynard.com/2006/10/beaten-down-by-a-gang-of-gay-liberal-thugs-in-ann-arbor), when he was severely beaten in Ann Arbor. The story went viral in conservative circles, as you may recall, as Zatkoff, a student at Oakwood University, was, the executive director of the Michigan College Republicans. Furthermore, which proclaimed the attack to be a “hate crime” perpetrated by “liberal thugs.”    
  

&gt;  Justin Zatkoff, Mich. was rumored to be targeted by militant leftist groups. Zatkoff, pictured above, did not know his attacker, and no money was stolen.    
&gt;  
&gt;A source close to Zatkoff reports:    
&gt;  
&gt;Justin may have been 1. randomly attacked (but not robbed??)
  
  
  As hard as it may be to believe, nose and nasal cavity were not broken by the members of BAMN, who, to my knowledge, have never done anything more radical than march around campus with signs advocating for affirmative action and immigrant rights. No, he was beaten by a friend in Ann Arbor after drunkenly provoking said friend. The following comes by way of the October 1, 2006 issue of the [Michigan Daily](http://www.michigandaily.com/content/alleged-political-hate-crime-not-what-it-seemed).    
  

&gt;  …Last Thursday, issued a statement urging students to “Keep (Justin) in your prayers” during his surgery and to “Travel in groups when possible, especially until the elections are over.”    
&gt;  
&gt;Carlson also included a link to the post on truthcaucus.com alleging that it was liberals who had beaten Zatkoff.    
&gt;  
&gt;The police report tells a much different story.    
&gt;  
&gt;Police said Zatkoff received his puffy purple left eye during a fight with a high school friend.    
&gt;  
&gt;Zatkoff was at a friend’s party on the 1100 block of White Street on Sept. 23 when he engaged in what the police report called “horseplay” with a friend. Fueled by alcohol
&gt;  
&gt;“When Zatkoff drinks
&gt;  
&gt;Another one of Zatkoff’s friends eventually admitted to police that it was he – not a gang of angry liberals – who punched Zatkoff.    
&gt;  
&gt;After learning of the friend’s confession
&gt;  
&gt;“I wanted people to be warned of it and be careful
  

  Well, by the name of Lawrence Paul Zatkoff. (*Judge Zatkoff, I’m told, is best known around these parts for [accusing federal agents of entrapment in a discrimination case against Ypsilanti landlords known for refusing to rent to families with children](http://annarborchronicle.com/2011/10/28/ypsi-housing/).*) Given that their shared last name isn’t terribly common, and that Lawrence is a graduate of Detroit Mercy School of Law, where Justin now attends, my guess is that the two men are related. I’m tempted to add something at this point about nepotism, given that Justin Zatkoff, stating that such policies gave students of color unfair advantage over their white counterparts
  

  So, is looking to clean up his online image. And, in order to see that accomplished, he sent out a slew of cease and desist letters citing the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) on October 31. (He maintained, in my case, that I didn’t have the rights to use the photo of him with the black eye, which accompanied my 2006 article.) Unfortunately, the company that hosts my site didn’t let me know until Thursday, on Friday, I guess you could say
  


  Being a bleeding heart liberal, upset and embarrassed when he got his ass kicked by a friend for being… to quote the Michigan Daily… “obnoxious” and “out of control.” I can easily imagine how someone in that situation might tell police, as Zatkoff did, that he didn’t know his attackers. I cannot begin to fathom, however, how he could allow the “hate crime” lie to spread across the internet, knowing full well that it wasn’t the case. While it’s unclear to me as to whether or not the idea to blame the attack on “liberal thugs” actually originated with Zatkoff, but the student members of BAMN
  

  But, if he’d written to me and explained that he’d learned from the experience, and was attempting to move forward with his life, I likely would have wished him well and removed the image without a second thought. Instead, however, he took legal action, forcing my site to be taken down. (Granted, to me, who thinks that he can bully people into assisting him in his quest to rewrite history, when I wrote
  

  [note: *According to a short update on the [Michigan Liberal](http://www.michiganliberal.com/diary/12887/) website in 2008, has also ""faced allegations of illegal campaign finance activity, immoral behavior (including posing semi-naked for sexually explicit photos), (and) corruption."" And, it would seem, this is not the first time that he's threatened to sue. ""In a weird twist of events,"" According to the report by Michigan Liberal
  

  And here’s the irony… Because of these recent threats of legal action over copyright, and, now, as a result of his actions, he’s going to experience the full force of the Streisand effect (the phenomenon whereby an attempt to hide or remove a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information more widely). Yes, a huge storm is forming off the coast, ready to blow inland. [Memes are gathering](http://www.quickmeme.com/Republican-Justin/?upcoming) on the horizon, a whole new generation of Americans will know about Zatkoff
  

  [update: *I've just been alerted to the fact that Justin now has his own [ArborWiki page](http://arborwiki.org/Justin_Zatkoff).*]

(Their article was on Zatkoff’s having been fired from his position within the Republican National Committee’s “Victory ’08″ Campaign, “after he stole 300,000 pieces of campaign literature from Michigan campaign headquarters.”) Another site, by the name of [Sadly No](http://www.sadlyno.com/archives/37833.html), is openly mocking his request, saying that the image that they’re using, falls under fair use. (I’m glad to see that not everyone has buckled under the pressure
  

  Oh, but [he’s petitioning Google to stop indexing pages](https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/copyright/owners/1995/Justin-Zatkoff/) that mention this sordid past.    
  

  All of this has me wondering if perhaps the College Republicans offer a Web-washing 101 course at their annual convention. And, consulting with young, conservative political operatives who want to hide their campus activities before heading into the real world. I suspect it could be quite lucrative.    
  

  The bottom line is that we can’t just let these things slide, regardless of whether or not they have a relative to pull strings and get them into law school. And, while we’re at it, I should add that the College Republicans, like the rest of the Republican party, need to undergo a serious reformation. I’d argue that these actions of Justin Zatkoff’s did not take place in a vacuum, but were informed by the culture of the College Republicans, impressionable conservatives may have served their cause well for a time,,1352663592.0

---
Requirements

- At least 18 years of age
- Must have your own vehicle
- No major traffic violations - DWI
- Must be available between 4pm and 1am Friday and Saturday.
- Must be available between 4pm and midnight at least a couple other days during the week.

---
Pay is $7.40/hr + tips + comp per delivery. I think the comp is currently $0.80/delivery. The owner changes it occasionally as gas prices fluctuate.

The possibility that you'd actually be working from 4pm to 1am any Friday or Saturday is extremely slim - unless you really want to! I just need some flexibility in scheduling. I'm happy to work around school and/or another job or three but when most of my crew has restricted schedules it can make it difficult to properly staff the business. Right now I could really use some people available from Monday to Wednesday as things are pretty tight those days.

The job is pretty easy. When you're not delivering you'd be helping out by answering phones, cleaning and so on. I can be a tough boss - I'm obsessed with making excellent product and providing excellent service, and based on our sales my obsession is paying off - but I try to keep things as light and fun as possible. We're always joking around, listening to music, just trying to have a good time while still working as well as we can.

To cut to the chase, but its not nearly enough. I'm terribly depressed about all of this...so I've decided to do something about it.

I enjoy writing, no hurting anyone else...other than that, I'm pretty open. In addition to trying to better my situation, I figure that keeping this up for a few months would allow me to meet a bunch of people I wouldn't meet otherwise, and do some interesting jobs that could be inspiration for future writing. So...need a ride to class? An essay? A handsome date to the prom, a la a romantic comedy? Solve your problem, help out a fellow denizen of A2

I recently adopted a one year old cat from the Huron Valley Humane Society. As it turns out

I've put a lot of thought into it and have decided that it's for the best to relocate the new little girl. Rather than take her back to the shelter

Here's a picture:
[kitty](http://imgur.com/oYLUc5L)

A little more info:
She's fully clawed
She's the most affectionate cat I've ever met.
She has no problems with other cats
She's tiny

I would also include all of her cat accessories that I got for her; litter box

If you or anyone you know are interested in adopting this adorable furball

Thanks.

As one possibility to make things work, rental of a room while units in certain areas become open.  I'm a 24 year old male young professional.  I am traveling super-light at the moment, everything I have fits in my small sedan comfortably.  I make a comfortable amount of money, so there would be no worries about payment or leeching off of whoever I would be renting from.  I am open to most price ranges (within reason!).  Basically, my options are to settle for an apartment that I can move into now or find a place to live for a month while other availabilities I have my eye on become open.  If you know of anyone who has a room open, needs a short-term fill-in while they look for a longer-term solution, has had a roommate just move out, please let me know.  I'll also likely make a post on craigslist,self,

There is also a nice unfenced backyard and BBQ area -- with an actual grilling pit (THINK OF ALL THE BACON EXPLOSIONS WE CAN GRILL OUT THERE!). The house is located next to Miller Nature Area, and is located on the #18 bus route. Alternatively it is only about a 10 minute bike ride to the UM campus. You will be sharing the house with two males, both 2nd year graduate students (Microbiology/Immunology and Immunology), who are social, active, and tidy. Rent runs at $550/month plus 1/3 of the utilities. The place would be available starting August 8th. We do have a dog (super friendly, so unfortunately we can't take any small karma machines (cats).

I haven't even found a place here that serves spicy peanut curry! What gives? Are there any hole in the wall joints I should be checking out? Any certain tear-inducing dishes at places that I wouldn't think to go? 

I appreciate hot food that has flavor. I could easily cover my food with Tabasco or Red Hot but then it would just taste like vinegar.

Reminders:

The Smithee Awards are free!  Monetarily free.  Any time lost is your own. 

There will be unhealthy snacks and drinks of colors not found in nature
(except perhaps in certain unsavory documentaries).  

The movies will contain incidents of violence (VIOLENCE!), and CAPITAL LETTERS (YELLING!).

Another reminder:  The Smithee Awards is a celebration of a certain type of cinematic excess.  We show five clips per category (Most Ludicrous Premise, and the audience votes as to which clip is the ""winner."" There are 19 categories, so the whole event lasts for several hours.  The audience is allowed to come and go as they please -- but there will be no one admitted after we have closed up for the night.

At the end of October, and food and beers and whatnot, no problem. But hotels? Not so much. So we ask of you this: anybody wanna put up a couple of big-dreamin' road travellers?

**A little about us:**

We are two twentysomething kids, live music, cats and dogs and birds and frogs. We don't ask for much: just a couch or a floor, or even a yard in which to pitch a tent (literally speaking, folks). We're well-mannered and housetrained. If you're up for it, we'd love to see your city from your point of view. Play the tour guide!

**What we can do for you:**

In exchange for your hospitality, wash your windows, vacuum the curtains, whatever. We can also guarantee reciprocation: come crash at our place in Brooklyn, any ol' time you'd like!

We realize this is a couchsurfing kinda situation, and reddit's yet to let us down.

We'll be in Ann Arbor on 10/30 and 10/31. If you can help us out

Here's a little background - I'm 23 years old, I've experienced all sorts of regional differences and local mannerisms.  I keep coming back to Ann Arbor.  

Some of that isn't by choice - my family moved here when I was in elementary school and stayed till middle school

Here's where my disenchantment begins - I returned to Ann Arbor with high hopes - I'd fall in with an awesome artsy crowd (more nerd than hipster, sell things that I make on the side, get a crazy cool job in copy writing or editing.  Unfortunately, none of these things have happened.  I do some part time work for a family friend, which is fun and would be a reasonable job if it were full time and reasonably secure (educational copy writing and editing mixed with general secretarial duties).  I babysit, I mow lawns, I make balloon animals at parties, but technically

I always figured that I'd sell things at the farmers market as a last resort.  I make some pretty neat things out of glass and metal, the farmers market is a giant political cesspit.  The people I spoke to in order to be part of it are so darn rotten that I'm now kind of jaded as far as Ann Arbor goes.  

In a way, though, I'm feeling like some sort of bad graft.  There's really nowhere else I'd rather be.

I'm not normally a whining person and it is probably a terrible decision to go and complain at reddit when I am so new, a friend?  I need to be convinced again that Ann Arbor is the best place.  ",,False,self,t5_2r5tm,False,,

1351647991.0,12di5r,How to vote on the ballot?,aelendel,22,15,13,"Hiya

My fiancee did a ton of research into the ballot proposals and wrote up a little bit about each one. Here you go if you want to see a short summary about how they actually will work

&gt;2012-1 Emergency Manager Law - vote no


&gt;    The powers of EMs to break contracts are voided by Proposal 2 anyhow. Moreover, and a better solution might be to facilitate rezoning and restructuring of charters and school districts instead.

&gt;2012-2 Guarantees the right of private and public sector employees to unionize and engage in group bargaining - vote yes

&gt;    Private sector workers are already protected under federal law and will be largely unaffected. However, and restructuring to accommodate new unions may get expensive, but in my opinion the benefits and protections far outweigh the costs.

&gt;2012-3 Increased renewable energy goal for 2025 - vote no

&gt;    While I do think switching our energy dependence to renewable sources, this law potentially outlaws solar power ( not renewable on a human timescale, part of a definition used in the wording of the law). It also only limits rate increases caused by the switch to renewable energy sources. Energy rates we pay can still increase significantly due to increased coal shipping costs, etc. Finally, there are all sorts of loopholes for utility companies to postpone meeting the timeline laid out in the law. All in all, it was a nice idea, but please try again.

&gt;2012-4 Some sort of collective bargaining rights for in home caregivers - vote no

&gt;    Like Proposal 1, which was good and bad (slammed with union fees, and very few of those eligible take advantage of the training those fees pay for). Finally came the ability to opt out of the union, although nonunion workers are still obligated to pay the fees. This new law wouldn't really change any of that mess, but it would enshrine it in the state constitution. Where all of those rights are already covered by Proposal 2, anyway. In other words, this one's another unnecessary

&gt;2012-5 Requiring a super majority in both houses of the state congress to raise taxes - vote no

&gt;    This is another law that is not what it seems. While it may seem this law will protect us from higher taxes, along with pursuant funding issues and delays in public works projects. And it's not like Michigan doesn't already have enough of that going on... This law would only further hobble the legislature without actually providing any of the perceived protections implied in the wording. Not a good choice.

&gt;2012-6 Requiring a public referendum on any future projects connecting Michigan to Canada - vote no

&gt;    This final proposal is yet another law that is not at all what it seems. The push for this proposal came almost entirely from the owners of the Ambassador Bridge, in response to plans to build another bridge in Detroit in order to better accommodate the heavy, often gridlocked shipping traffic bottlenecked by the current system. The proposed referendum would not even follow normal procedure for receiving public approval of new works, completely bypassing the legislature in an unprecedented move. Furthermore, it could also negatively impact Michigan's other major ports in Sault Ste Marie and Port Huron. Essentially, this is a poorly framed power grab by the owners of the Ambassador Bridge to legitimize and perpetuate their current shipping monopoly in Detroit, thinly veiled as being in the people's interest. Besides

&gt;For more information, nonpartisan Citizens Research Council of Michigan's in depth analyses of these ballot proposals at http://www.crcmich.org/election/index.html.

&gt;For even more detail about what you specifically will see on your Michigan ballot and where to vote, with links to all the candidates who have websites. Remember, we're also voting for Congress, mayor, people to run our state universities, and judges, among others this election.

&gt;Finally, and vote informed!

As I mentioned, showing me around, or possibly getting together a Reddit meetup while I'm there. I'd love to attend a meetup if we could make something happen, but I'm also definitely interested in maybe making a couple of friends in the area to do things with one-on-one or in small groups or what have you. If I enjoy Ann Arbor as much as I think I will, I'll be back in the future, so it would be nice to make some friends in the area. I've messaged a few of you already but thought I would put this all together in a post and see who all might be interested. 


Here's my ever-expanding list of things I'm planning to do while there. Feel free to recommend any other awesome thing I shouldn't miss out on:

* Top of the Park

* Explore UofM (includes feeding squirrels in the Diag and spinning the cube)

* Kerrytown shops and farmer's market

* Pinball Pete's

* Michigan/State Theaters

* The Ark

* Graffiti Alley

* Fairy doors

* Leslie Science + Nature Center

* Museums

* Nichols Arb

* Zingerman's Tour de Bacon (anyone want to do this with me? Some of their locations look to be a little further out and I'm thinking might be more fun to visit with someone else than by myself. Plus

* General downtown wandering



Also, does anyone have an extra bike/lock they'd be willing to loan me? I'm 5'4"" if that helps any. Not terribly familiar with bike measurements or what size I need and all that.

I'm finding it a bit challenging to rent a place from such a distance. Budgetary concerns make it such that I really can't make a trip up to apartment shop, or renting to anyone from a distance. So even if I find a place I like on Craigslist (which I have), I will apparently seem like a scam artist if I try to rent it from here. Oy.

A few more details:

1) I will not have a car. I'm more than happy to take public transit everywhere, coffee)

2) I have 2 dogs. Both female mutts, accustomed to apartment living one ~50lb, one ~30lb. A bit more challenging to find a place that will take big-ish dogs.

3) I'm happy to do a sublet for the summer and then get a new place when leases start in August.

4) I'm hoping to stay below $900 if possible.

So... does anyone have any experience or insight? Any other tips for a southerner moving up to the mysterious midwest?
