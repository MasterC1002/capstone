After two years of nothing but absolute hell, cheated, lied to, and betrayed. It was the last straw.

That night I was sitting in my car when I put my 9mm pistol to my head. I was going through my life, or my father.

I immediately drove to the nearest mental hospital with nothing more than the clothes on my back. I told them that I was certain I wouldn't live through the night if they didn't help me. I was 'incarcerated' there for 6 days.

While the time spent between group therapy meetings and speaking with the psychiatrist was the most extreme and excruciating boredom I'd ever experienced

Basically my life was like a game of Jenga. My life was like a new tower- organized, pieces of my life were taken away, lost, or pushed away. Eventually it came down to that one critical piece supporting everything else, and when it was removed, everything came crashing down.

I learned that my mistake was basing my happiness and emotional well-being on whether others accepted or supported me. I tried to force others to like and accept me

I know now that I must first **become the person that I want to be.** This isn't an issue of not ""accepting myself""

I am going to finally lose the weight that has made me so insecure.

I am going to eat healthy.

I am going to go to therapy.

How? I was naive and I told everybody about my diagnosis. I never had to deal with the stigma of being Bipolar. I have never had to deal with the ignorance and it burns like magma in my gut. 

For example, she was tells me that her friends are just lazy to work because they are on disability. That her one friend should just get over being depressed and get out of her room.

**It's like the idea that bipolar disorder is a serious disability is completely off her radar and that we're just lazy.** 

Or another family member telling me that ""Everybody has ups and downs."" Or ""You'll get over it."" I mean

**But now that I have finally been diagnosed I should just use the power of positive thinking to miraculously cure my brain.** 

The ignorance

I have also yet to run into anybody who isn't bipolar who understands that episodes can lead to psychosis and delusions that are very similar to schizophrenia. 

**In fact

It upsets me that bipolar disorder is looked at as almost a joke and yet so few people even know what it is.

They think that manic episodes are the only defining feature. The fact is many of us have relatively light manic episodes. We may only have one or two major manic episodes in our past. The rest of the time many of us are suffering from serious chronic depression. 

I don't have to preach to the choir here. But you know what I mean. It's like bipolar is a punchline instead of an illness.

**The general public assumes we're just lazy. Or psychotic psycho killers who should be locked up with criminals.** 

Or just making excuses. You know

**In general we don't tell people with MS that their debilitating illness is just an excuse and that they should work harder.**

You get breast cancer or prostate cancer and family and friends actually cares enough to ask you about it. 

To offer to help you out when you need it. 

Breast Cancer: 98% cure rate if diagnosed early.
Prostate Cancer: 95%  cure rate if diagnosed early.

Bipolar Disorder: NO CURE

15-25% increased risk of suicide.
Average -9 years of life.

&gt; You are not normal. You’re not inferior to other people, and the only people who will empathize are those who have been there. It’s like someone handed you a spoon, when everyone else has a shovel, and you’re expected to dig the same size hole. It doesn’t mean you’re worth less than them if you can’t do it. You might feel that way sometimes, because “normal” people expect you to be handling your problems the same way they do. They might think you’re making excuses, or just not trying hard enough. It hurts to have people frustrated at you because you just can’t do something they can. You’ll get frustrated at yourself. It’ll feel like you’re not good enough. If you were, you could deal the same way everyone else does,** it’s just that the tools you were given mean you have to work harder than other people. You’ll notice that “normal” people also lack that little voice in their head that constantly tells them they’re not good enough.

&gt; Also, when you screw up. Lying might seem like the solution, but trust me when I say it’s not. You’re lying to yourself when you think, “I could do that if I tried, so why bother trying?” You’re lying to other people by pretending to be okay when you’re really overwhelmed. It sounds like a cliché, but there’s **no shame** in needing help. You don’t have to do everything by yourself to make up for being “born inferior” (you are not inferior). Nobody expects you to be perfect. Stop punishing yourself. You shouldn’t aspire to be better than everyone else, and you’re not worse than everyone else right now. You are you, but I’m not sure yet)

&gt; Your high points don’t negate the low ones. Going from a crying mess of a person to a happy teenager who just needs to wear long sleeves to cover it up **doesn’t mean it’s fine.** Just because you’re not feeling low doesn’t mean you never did, and you need to own that. Stop disconnecting from it. Control is so hard to come by in your life, you need to at least have control over **having** a problem.

&gt; Now, and deal with one thing at a time, or even half a thing. Remember, the tools given to you aren’t as effective as everyone else’s, so it’ll take more effort to solve your problems. There will be days where you wake up and don’t even want to get out of bed. Be gentle with yourself, and realize that punishing yourself for not pushing hard enough is even more unnecessary strain.

&gt; Between you and me, thinking about all the things you’ve done wrong. Criticism can still feel like a punch to the gut. You’ll still be angry at yourself for screwing up. You’ll still be angry at other people for not treating you kindly, while simultaneously feeling like you have no right to have such great people in your life. You’ll be aware that your (fairly rock-solid) relationship is really just a fragile thread keeping your head above water. Going to class will still be a struggle. Going to bed before sunrise will happen 75% of the time. Homework assignments will get lost. You’ll have times where you daydream about swerving into oncoming traffic.

&gt; But seriously. Stop it. Just stop. Stop thinking you’re not good enough. Stop focusing on everything that’s wrong with you, you’re not alone. You’re not normal, but **that’s okay.**

1320752657.0,m4pm2,PSA: References to alternative medicine as treatment for bipolar disorder will not be tolerated in this forum. We now need your suggestions to be backed by peer reviewed articles. ,KingOfZalo,56,11,137,"There might be many ways of treating bipolar disorder. The best result would be that the person affected feel better and have a well functioning life. Even though there are standards


On a regular basis we get posts here in r/bipolarreddit about alternative ways of treating bipolar disorder. Some think that we are the new branch of evolution and that medicine only disturbs our natural abilities. Others think that the moderators of the forum are representatives of “big pharma” and that this causes us to block all posts about alternative treatments. Others again feel that everybody should smoke a lot of weed and that this will fix all our problems. After a discussion


We wish to address suggestions to treatment of bipolar disorder through various supplements that can be defined as alternative medicine. We, science and facts. If there are activities, food, herbs or other things people believe people can benefit from - we will accept a debate around this as long as these posts can be backed up by science. If yoga helps you - good! If exercise helps you - great. If smoking weed helps you - ok - but for all cases – if you suggest it as treatment you need to show us some proof that it might help others. This proof should be delivered through references too peer reviewed
articles. But – in the case you suggest that people switch their Lithium with vitamins or sugar pills - your post will be moderated and your account will be followed by the moderators. Why? We think Bluesatin said it well: “If your bipolar was suppressed with multi-vitamins


“Public acceptance of alternative medicine has been fuelled by a sense of disillusionment many have come to feel toward all authority figures in these troubled times. The rush to dethrone physicians is born of an odd mix of social envy, the latter arising from a number of admittedly over-reaching promises upon which biomedicine has yet to make good. Disaffection has also been prompted by a growing feeling that medical care has become too rushed, overly-technical, and depersonalized. Other detractors are unhappy at the lack of cures for certain chronic conditions which biomedicine does not always manage as well as sufferers might wish. This disenchantment has been intensified in some quarters by a renewed willingness to entertain grand conspiracy theories. An anti-science and anti-physician backlash has resulted from this need to believe that secret plotting on the part of powerful self-serving cabals underlies society’s shortcomings. As a powerful institution with political aims of its own, medicine has filled the role of villain for various conspiracy mongers. Proponents of alternative medicine have been quick to capitalize on this climate of suspicion because it supports their claim that their rejection by orthodox practitioners is merely a ploy to protect the influence and earnings of the medical establishment. Unfortunately, many in their audience seem incapable of separating whatever misgivings they might have about the socio-political activities of doctors as a powerful, self-regulating profession from the question of whether the treatments biomedicine has at its command are genuinely better than those of the “alternatives.” Barry L. Beyerstein


“Holistic medicine tends to fill the void some feel has been created by the technocratization and depersonalization of orthodox medicine. Alternative healers provide comfort and possibly add to the quality of life for those for whom neither they nor orthodox physicians can offer a cure. Its emphasis on interpersonal relations, the “alternatives’” tendency to divert patients from more effective, scientifically proven therapies are costs to them, and its popularization of pseudoscience and magical thinking are costs to us all. The burden of proof remains on the proponents—our demand should always be for objective evidence, for as Francis Bacon warned, “...what a man had rather were true he more readily believes.” Barry L. Beyerstein, Ph.D.



TL:DR   r/bipolarreddit demands that you post links to peer reviewed articles if you are suggesting some way of treating bipolar disorder. Any suggestions that the moderators define as “alternative medicine” will be deleted and the user posting this will be banned.

1368659648.0,1eeyus,Tips for doing a lot of dishes,inanis,48,6,26,"If anyone else here is like me and has major issues with consistently doing chores I have a few tips. Over the past few days I've been steadily working through a few months of dishes and other chores to actually clean the house. Here are a few things I've found helpful:

* Don't do everything at once! I'm sure you can do it all in one day when your super manic and you stay up until 5 am scrubbing your bath tub

* Pick one type of dish and wash all of them. It helps you pace yourself and it also helps with a sense of accomplishment. I like working in this order: plates, cups, cookware. If I just do one sink full of dishes I feel like I haven't gotten anything done and don't do dishes the next day.
* Don't hide your dirty dishes! Hiding them is like giving up. If you can't cook because your stove is covered in dishes don't put them in the oven

1294008497.0,ev419,PSA - DO NOT SELF-DIAGNOSE / STEPS TO GETTING HELP,michaelnero,48,6,40,"Lately /r/BP has seen a rash of threads where someone states they believe they have Bipolar Disorder due to internet research or anecdotal evidence from conversation. 

While it's absolutely necessary to admit there may be something wrong - Self-diagnosis can be a damaging experience. This is known as ""[Labeling Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labeling_theory#The_.22mentally_ill.22)"" (a form of self-fulfilling prophecy that may color how you interact with your doctor.)

&gt;[Self-diagnosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-diagnosis) is prone to error and may be potentially dangerous if inappropriate decisions are made on the basis of a misdiagnosis. Because of the risks, and patient care organizations. Even physicians are discouraged from engaging in self-diagnosis, because doctors too make mistakes in diagnosing themselves. If the self-diagnosis is wrong, then the misdiagnosis can result in improper health care, including wrong treatments and lack of care for serious conditions.

Recognizing there is an issue, and this may help you get perspective, you need to realize that **you are not qualified to definitively diagnose yourself.** That Abilify, Celexa, Zoloft, or Cymbalta commercial might seem like it's everything you've ever felt, but that's the point. They are trying to sell you a product.

We don't want you to feel like you are being looked down on. Remember that anyone on /r/BP is willing to lend an ear, and armchair psychologists in the quest to get treatment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**STEPS TO GETTING TREATMENT**

1. **Seek out a psychologist for initial diagnosis.** Typically they will delve deeper than a psychiatrist in this regard

2. **Outline a time frame of when you remember feeling this way.**

3. **Jot down events

4. **Make a list of ""out of the ordinary"" symptoms you have noticed.** This may range from changes in sleep patterns to sexual addiction to consistent irritability. Steps 1 - 3 will help your doctor diagnose and gauge the severity of the situation.

5. **Make a log of your progress week over week after your initial doctor visits.** Note how therapy has adjusted your ability to cope

6. **Never stop taking or adjust your medication without consulting your psychiatrist.** Many medications require ""step down"" periods

First

Just thought I'd post an update that we're still dating! I've learned so many things about bipolar disorder in the past year and a half. I've seen her lows, her psychosis, and everything in between. It's not easy. It's pretty freakin' hard, actually. But I will say it's all been worth it.

A quick update: 
-She finished school and reduced her work hours

-She became more and more receptive to the idea of seeing a doctor... as of right now

-She's currently having success with an antipsychotic+antidepressant, that actually improved her symptoms. 

Don't let anyone tell you that having bipolar disorder condemns you to being foreveralone. If someone you're interested in is scared off after they find out

According to the doctors and pill counts
Septmber 20th

So down then went

First it felt like gravity was cut in half...my head was swaying around and I couldn't walk straight...then the lights started to get bright and things started spinning a bit... at that point I freaked out and called 911

Then I colasped on the front porch clinging for dear life to the railing as the world around me started literally spinning around.
I ended up pulling several of the wooden bracers off the porch railing completely un aware of what was going on. 
The paramedics had arrived by then and they started to do testing and discovered I wasn't able to walk.
After they got me into he ambulance the spinning went to fullon rollercoaster dips and dives
After that memories became so blurred. I remember shrill screams of fear and panic.
but This wasn't over yet.
about 45minutes in
I remember at one point trying to scratch my noise and my arm cam flying up in my face so hard that I busted my lip open and gave myself a gushing bloody noise.
I remember just crying and screaming ""I'm sorry I'm sorry please don't leave me here""
I also remember trying fuirtlessly to stop the spinning and gravity shift with my feet

Then came the throwing up. which was isnanely painful. My eyes hurt so bad from the lighting
2 police officers were holding me down as the violent thrashing was getting too dangerous for people to be near me and with medical equipment and the already several bloodied lacerations on my wrists and hands they had to hold me down until I tied down to a hospital bed.
And then finally came the insane fear and paranoia. I was so scared of being seen naked
Every noise made me scream with fear
I was so scared and the world was so insanely spinning 
And then....

Nothing. I had finally sucomb to the drugs affects. I was slipping away.

I spent a week in the ICU

They simply hooked me up to IV's and hoped it would help. The simply didn't know if I was going to survive so the nurses tried to make it as comfortably as possible for me as I died.
but my body had ejected enough of the drug durning the vomiting spells that there wasn't enough to be absorded to be lethal.

I woke up 6days later in the ICU, I couldn't walk or even tell where I was.

over the next few days I was moved to a high risk unit and was watched closely as I slowly regained consciousness.
I spent another week being helped around because I couldn't walk yet.
After I was stable enough I was sent to the mental health unit to be evaluated and tested.
3 1/2 weeks in the hospital.

and now no doctor will prescribe me lamictal

The way my moods are, not smart when I've just started quetiapine but I cannot bear feeling that way and I had to take the edge off; I self-harmed last night and I don't want to do that again- it's best described as like squeezing an orange and all that comes out is gallons of pus.

1342573594.0,wqfct,Psychiatric Service Dog: The best thing that has ever happened to me!,notcoolawesome,36,2,33,"quick background: I have BPII and have been repeatedly hospitalized. I have now been stable for over a year but still have panic attacks. I am 20 and in college. I completed my first semester of college last semester after a few attempts that ended with me in the hospital. Needless to say, but my dog was there for me every time i needed him. He made it possible for me to get through an attack and get on with my day. It changed my life. I was able to complete all of my courses and finished my first semester of college. I was so happy after my last final that i just sat there and cried and held my dog. (people were stopping to ask if i was ok lol) Since then,
1336569730.0,ten9i,It never gets easier. You just get better at it.,LaurenClassic,42,7,7,"A year ago we discovered that I have Bipolar Disorder type I. Saturday

After spending two years in a Lexapro-induced hypomania with horrendous, I was taken off the Lexapro at the beginning of my senior, I crashed. It was most assuredly the worst four months of my life. I lived on someone else's couch because I couldn't be alone. I cried every day for several hours. My average rating on the How-Much-Would-You-Care-If-You-Died-Today scale stayed around a 2.

However, many failed attempts with medicines such as Lamictal and Abilify, my psychiatrist finally put me on Lithium. I guess you could say I have a love-hate relationship with it. I've thrown up in three buildings on campus because of it. I shake all the time, I get disoriented fairly easily, I'm always thirsty--these are just some of the side-effects I have dealt with. Yet, it worked for me (along with a couple other things). I stopped crying. I went home. I pulled my shit together and passed all my classes for that semester. My psychologist was there the whole time, ready to talk or listen, these two doctors.

Anyway, it is. You're not the only person crying for no reason, nor are you the only person digging yourself into a deep hole of debt because you just had to this or that. We're all struggling in some way. Success is just a matter of seeing that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Every bad decision you make will one day lead you to a good decision. There is something good in store of every single of us, whether we can imagine it or not. Life isn't over because you're in the darkness right now. It just means you better learn to appreciate the sun.

Living this life never gets easier. But you learn more bout yourself and observe more about the world than anyone else because of it. Let gifts make it worth it.

1327004272.0,onql2,Can the mods weigh in? r/bipolar vs. r/bipolarreddit,bennyearl,42,7,40,Before it gets too big I thought the mods of r/bipolar and r/bipolarreddit should weigh in with their thoughts of the two sites.  Reason being is that it slightly confuses me and I really don't want to have to check both sites to discuss the same information.  It might be just me so feel free to downvote this if you disagree but I am hoping to start a conversation with the differences between the two sites.  I understand r/bipolar lets you post links and pictures for karma.  I know that it was dormant for awhile but has since been rejuvenated.  My thought is that one could be used for funny pictures and links and the other could continue to be self posts.  However I think the mods should either merge the two (if that is even possible) or embrace each other by linking to the other subreddit in the sidebar.  Too often newbies will come to site and the information will be splintered and they won't know about the other subreddit.  My two cents.  I would love for the mods of both sites to weigh in with their rationale if they don't mind.  Thanks!,t5_2qzru,True

1342579250.0,wql3j,Things I've Learned Since Getting Diagnosed With Bipolar Disorder...,rachdone,33,2,5,"I was diagnosed with mixed-episode

1) Learning how to deal with bipolar disorder is often a case of trial and error.

This can refer to finding a medication combination that works (I’m currently on my third try of medication) or finding ways to cope with the complexities of this disorder on a day to day basis. You have to find things, that can help you get through each day, and so often this process lacks consistency. Writing helps me cope—I’ve found that it’s much easier for me to write about things I still can’t talk about. It helps me get the overwhelming tide of feelings out.

Find something that helps you feel a little bit free. This will most likely not happen in one day


2) Be kind to yourself.

For me (partly because my story includes abuse), and have to cancel plans at the last minute. I get trapped in a horrible cycle of thinking, one that leaves me convinced that I’ll die alone with wild dogs fighting themselves over snacking on my dead body. Right now, when I’m not symptomatic, this seems funny; when I’m drowning in my mind, it feels inevitable.

Even if being kind to yourself feels stupid, you should still do it.

What this can look like: buying yourself a cupcake, taking a hot shower, going for a walk, making a playlist of songs that make you happy, or something else entirely. 

3) Have a plan of action for when things get really

Bipolar disorder has one of the highest suicide rates for any mental disorder. Take steps to keep yourself safe. No matter what, or like a nice statement that was great for everyone else, but not for me. 

This is going to look different for everyone else. Here’s what I do.

I am unbelievably lucky to have two best friends, FYI.) I’ve spent two full years in CBT (cognitive-based therapy) and try to find a way to handle the emotional changes myself, but when I can’t, I ask for help.

DO NOT BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR HELP.

That works for me when I’m depressive. When I’m manic, paranoid, talkative (I’ll stutter or repeat things), irritable, and the like. I have too much energy, and the slightest thing (a post on Facebook, someone not responding to a text message as quickly as I’d like

My essay was extremely anecdotal and personal; whereas the Indonesian's was very technical and statistical. The prompt was based around how one would go about eradicating stigma by 2020.

I won $500 and read my essay at a public forum near the headquarters of the IBF, which was awesome.

This is just one example of the fact that mental illness doesn't have to stop you from achieving goals and improving as a person. And people who suffer and recover from mental illness have a unique perspective on life and suffering

Here is the essay: 

*""My World Is Your World""*

I walk into class, Whitman, Twain. Others. Success stories. Reminders of what is possible inside my world. Our world.

The bipolar world.

I sit, “Words Hurt”, “If You Only Knew Me”- on the student television show. I recognize their causes and struggles with a mixture of great respect and weary indifference. I’ve heard it all before, I’ve seen the beauty of social progression towards
acceptance.

But there’s something missing.

Enter May- Mental Health Awareness month. My mind has become increasingly preoccupied with the serious lack of education and consideration in the public school system for mental health awareness.

One could say that I have experienced the full and direct effect of such prevalent ignorance amongst today’s youth.

I received the diagnosis of Type II Bipolar Disorder at the young age of thirteen. For nearly four years I catapulted through the air; soaring up and up and up, and I could not agree more.

That is why I take offense to the erroneous vision of mental illness. The stigmatized, such disgust at the very thought of being “crazy”, a daily experience I find to be incredibly upsetting and painful. I know that I am not alone in this.

Society has painted such a “comprehensive” portrait of this disorder; people can hardly tear their eyes from it. They refuse to listen or attempt to modify their reinforced views.

Some things need to change. By 2020

In order to do so, we are that much closer to ending the stigma. I no longer want to feel ashamed and afraid of my identity, and I want the silent community of people like me to shed their fear and embrace their identity for our world to see.


Looking back at it, it's about the past horrors of my illness. 

Let's work together to keep fighting the stigma!!

Edit: 
Here is the poem. This is the original one I wrote


*A Goodbye*



For me it started as thus;

A fire

Low and beautiful 

Jumping up

Catching the walls 

Growing brighter

A glorious inferno

A thousand spiraling words 

Pouring into my eyes

The brilliance of colours that I could not name 

Clothes removed in a high speed chase 

The warmth of euphoria and false love

At once all-consuming and terrifying 

A blazing

Now careening

Falling towards the earth

The walls crumble and collapse inward

And I am left in darkness.



For all the brightness in the world

This- yes

This was the inevitability of a stone sinking

To the bottom of the deepest ocean.

This was the other blindness.



Caressed by tears

In a chokehold of empty space 

A sea of blankets and dark eyes


Knowing nothing. 

Seeing nothing. 



The never-filled plate

Piled high with worry and need 

I’m feeding a hole that only grows. 




Hands pass me by

No; I don’t want to play today. 

There is nothing- 

There will only be nothing.  



The many possibilities in the kitchen 

Give to me temporarily 

What I need 

Permanently. 



Peace.

All I want is peace. 



Looking back at the thing now

You and I 

We murdered friendships

Achieved brilliance 

Longed for death

Stopped time. 



To the monster that I knew so well-

Goodbye

Thank-you all for your thoughtful comments and help.

This morning I talked with my the mental health resource people in my employee assistance program at work

I called the local health authority to find out what to do next

I talked to my wife, and that the nurse I spoke to had told me that I should not leave her alone with our girls until she had done so.

I added that if the doctor thought that you were Ok

She was quiet for a while

I couldn't find anyone to watch the kids, and keeping her comforted.

After a few hours, the nurse came out to talk to me, and was surprised (and happy) that I had a written timeline of what happened when.  She took it off (and I presume copied it).  

When she returned, I was surprised at how disoriented my wife had become.  I'm assuming its because of the exhaustion (she has hardly slept at all for the past few days).

We were interviewed together

Partway through the doctor came in

He asked her if she would stay overnight and take some medication to help her sleep.  She (surprisingly to me) agreed.  He prescribed two medications, but I forgot to write it down at the time, and he disappeared shortly after).  They also took blood-work to try to check for physical causes.

She is now in the hospital sleeping.  She agreed to one day

I don't have any sort of a diagnosis from the hospital yet.  The nurses in the Mental Health Unit said that the direction from the doctor at this point is to get her rested.

One comment that the nurse made was complimenting me for doing the right thing so quickly.  Apparently it normally takes much longer before the professionals get involved.

Thank-you to you all for helping me find the right things to do

Edit:  Learned one thing new today.  For here (Manitoba), now that she's in, she can not check herself out.

The meeting was held in a nearby church inside a small conference room. Chairs and love seats were turned inward surrounding a coffee table filled with mental health pamphlets and a strategically placed box of tissues. We were a circle of solemn faces, some in pairs, some alone. And we were united with one goal: support for the mental illness affecting our lives.
There were tragic stories of loss as well as inspiring stories of hope. Mothers, wives, friends. Each of us, in clockwise order, took our turn guided by the encouraging kindness of our group leader. Some had lots to say, while others uttered very little. It was obvious who had told their stories before. Theirs were told with stoic poise and sometimes slightly uncomfortable humor. Those who were new to this were obvious too, as tears streamed down their faces as they spoke of their suffering.

Since I sat nearest to the group leader, to share the grief that clouded the room.

“I'm here because of my son. In the fall of 2010 he wanted to kill himself...” I began to tell my story aloud for the very first time. Sure, but never had I laid it out so openly, so raw, to a group of total strangers.
I told them everything. My voice quivered as I told them about the gun my son acquired at the mental hospital. Tears swelled up when I confessed the fear I felt for my very own child. My stomach clenched as I spoke so freely. My story just told itself.

My listeners were more than kind. They hung on my every word. They nodded in recognition of my feelings

When I'd poured out everything, a renewed sense of strength that had grown inside of me. I'd emptied my heart into the laps of strangers and in return, I'd gained hope and understanding from them. I was even marked a “success”, a “survivor” a “model of strength”. The people there listened to my story with hope of learning something from me. That's what was the most surprising. While I attended the meeting hoping to find support, after sharing, I discovered I actually provided support and hope to others. That was the best part of all.

But that doesn't answer the question of why we have this delusion in the first place. I will offer my opinion and would love to hear any other. During mania, the explanation for all of these thoughts doesn't exist, but we need an explanation nonetheless. I think that by calling yourself God, you have found a convenient way to ""explain"" or make sense of all of your irrational beliefs, which is that everything is happening to your liking, therefore nothing really needs an explanation. Bipolar people become god during mania to feel comfortable with the unknown, just like religious non-bipolar people believe in God for the same reason.

I saw my pdoc today. I wasn't quite sure what to make of how I was (and am) feeling. A weird hypomania, and able to maintain a clear, focused train of thought and conversation. That's what I figured it must be at least. After all, if I'm happy and motivated, it must be hypomania. But I've never felt quite like this before. She said she's seen me through a few different states (true on account of my rapid cycling) and that she thought I seemed stable for once. Is this actually ""me""?

Well, still feeling fine. Called a cab for a ride home, a torrential downpour started immediately, and they left me standing in the rain in a t-shirt and shorts for 45 minutes. Disappointed, sure, but not raging. Called and canceled very matter-of-factly and took the bus. Still not freaking out or brooding. Might not be able to make it to the volunteer orientation at the animal shelter I was planning to go to tomorrow on account of my car being broken. Oh well, I can just go to the one next week

This is fucking amazing. I have seriously never felt like this before in my entire life. This is better than any hypomania ever. My hypomanias, I'm not pissed off about things I have no control over or can't change, I'm not stupidly giddy, my mind isn't racing but also not dulled, I'm going out and doing a lot but not recklessly, I have no pressured speech or flights of ideas, I'm not physically shaking from enthusiasm. And I'm not emotionless or numb. I'm just... content. And happy - and this feels different from manic-happy - because I can take a step back and see that in the big picture, also feeling frustration when things go wrong

To make sure I don't swing hypomanic from here, sleeping regularly, and various other lifestyle changes.

I'm a little afraid that this is just transitory and I'll be back to hypomanic recklessness and agitation or depressive brooding soon

I told him that I'm overwhelmed and not sure what route I want to take. I don't know how often the psychiatrist will want to see me once I go on Lithium. Once a month? A week?

I told him I thought he was a blackmailing asshole

I am an inmate. I am a good person who's done something incredibly stupid. No one was hurt

From inside my cell

I want so bad to be normal. To know what it feels like to think normally. I am blessed. I am cursed... I am bipolar.
I think it all started in grade school. I would do anything I wanted simply because I didn't know how to control myself. That little voice of reason in your head that tells you right from wrong? Yeah, right before recess. That's when I had my first realization about how differently I think. I remember being so excited for recess and then at the next split second, I was incredibly sad for no reason. Today I am so relieved now to know that I'm not a freak. I'm just bipolar.

If you catch me on the wrong day I may be so depressed it's sickening. Then again

At the moment I am incredibly manic. I can't slow down my mind. I have nothing in my life to excite me but I feel like running up a wall. Today for lunch the prison is serving peanut butter and jelly. That makes me jump for joy.

Being here now. All this could have been prevented. But my illness had hold of me.

Three years ago I was living at my mother's house. I was so up and down it scared my family. I did something that broke my mom's heart. I was so depressed at the time. I was 18 years old

I planned to commit suicide.

Luckily

My mom and uncle devised a plan to help me. I was given an ultimatum. I either go to a young adult mental health hospital to get help or I move out. Now I had nowhere else to go. Nowhere. But...I chose to move out.
I wish I had gotten help. I wish I had saved my future but I didn't. I remember packing my things in a manic rage and heading out the front door. I went to the only place I knew I was welcome. Somewhere that helped me destroy myself.

I knocked on the rotting door in front of me. The door opened. He opened it. I told him the situation and he invited me to stay. The house was disgusting
There were no rules...at all. I am someone who has always had structure which helped me and my everchanging mental state. But here there were no rules. This let my manic self soar past the point of no return. I didn't sleep for 3 days. I remember the feeling so well. I should have been tired

Then it happened.

Like the world crashed down on me. I became so sad. So depressed. My illness helped convince myself that I had no one in my life that loved me. One extreme to the other. Think of the saddest moment in your life. Now think of the happiest. Now
I lived house to house

I remember being talked into going to a mental hospital for an outpatient program. I did it. I completed the bullsh*t program easily and promised to take my life seriously. Now listen. The only way to help someone with their mental illness is to have them help themselves. I didn't want the help. I didn't think I needed it. So the program didn't really help me. I wasn't ready.
Fast forward another year. I'm 20 almost 21. In a manic rage fueled by idiot ""friends"" and grain alcohol I landed myself in prison with very serious charges. My only escape is writing and a 15 minute phone call to family. I'm finally taking my life...my illness...seriously. And I actually WANT help.

I want help. And I need help.

Structure. Militant structure. Wake up, work out, rec time, lunchtime, lock in. Prison is extreme. Prison is unbelievable. It is my life.
Three months ago I made a choice...that drunken choice...I regret everyday. My life is the hardest it's ever been. I'm locked up with murderers

I hope I am out by next birthday. I turned 21 in here. Most people remember their 21st birthday as a fuzzy blur. I was locked up in a 6 x 12 cell with two full grown angry, this is extreme. Twenty-one years old and I've had more excitement, ups and downs and pain than most people have in a lifetime. But don't focus on the negatives. I am alive. I am relatively sane. I am getting mental help that I need. I am sober. I am learning to be happy again.
Now, in prison, I can be happy anywhere. I know I can appreciate life 100 times more than before. The negatives may outweigh the positives at the moment but that's only temporary. Everyone has a path. Whether you believed it's predestined or you make it yourself, everyone has a path. My path has been one of extremes.

Hopefully

Appreciate the little things. The feeling of a breeze. The ability to decide what you do, is starving, or is locked up. Even me. I have it better than some people. I'm thankful to have a loving family, two parents, a brother...and a good lawyer (sorry, prison humor). Anyway, I appreciate the little things.

Sometimes in here

Take a second to step out of your life. Imagine being in one big room with men who all thrive on hurting people. It sucks. That plus never getting sleep without nightmares of being sentenced 3-15 years. This is my reality. I may not step out of prison for several years...all because of a mental illness that I never took seriously. I've always done things the hard way. This is the hardest way possible.

I have been diagnosed with depression for a number of years.  In the last six months my psychiatrist has put me through Wellbutrin, Remeron, Cymbalta, and Pristiq for depression.  Yeah, that's a hell of a lot -- he even forgot which ones I was on half the time when I visited his office.  I'd also been taking Trazodone for the insomnia that Pristiq causes.

Last week I went from being extremely sad to extremely happy (like overnight), active, and anxious over the next week.  I slept five hours a night despite the sleeping pills.  Toward the end of the week, I got extremely agitated, way anxious about everything, was piled high with regret about everything that had ever happened in my life at once, and wanted to commit suicide just to get the hell out of my racing head.

I went to my therapist in panic, so I called the hospital; when they didn't return my call for a good three hours, my friends drove me down there in person.  The staff told me I would not be permitted to leave for my safety.

I was then committed to a psych ward for 2 days (despite no psychosis or delusional symptoms).  I was stripped of my dignity and all contact to my (awesome) friends who are my only real support through all the ups and downs of what I thought was just depression.  The doctors barely spoke to me but told me I was a danger to myself

My mom flew across the country to ask them to let me out in her care, but the nurses and doctors didn't laugh at a single fucking thing or even give the slightest indication that they actually cared.  To top it all off, my psychiatrist fucking *forgot* to give me Prisitq while I was in the hospital, and Pristiq allegedly has the worst discontinuation syndrome of any SNRI.  I have what are apparently called ""brain zaps,"" and they're here constantly, and they're extremely uncomfortable (not quite painful, but close).

At the end of the day, but I don't trust psychiatrists any more.  They did the worst possible thing for my mental health (cut off all social contact with the sane), stripped me of my dignity, and completely fucking failed to give me any actual help.  I'm not taking the Pristiq because I'm already in the depths of serious discontinuation syndrome and if I decide not to continue psychiatric medications I'm sure as hell not doing it twice.  I'm not going to start the Seroquel either, because honestly the possibility of metabolic syndrome among other side effects just doesn't seem worth the potential gain.  Especially if Pristiq alone may be responsible for whatever happened last week.

I trust my therapist, and how long should I expect it to last?

I can no longer remember sequences of recent events. I'm dimly aware that time is passing

My brain knows exactly what to do. This is a frighteningly familiar path, I've lost control and shot skywards like a manic rocket.

The mind is never quieted. Every thought, and nothing will ever improve.

Feeling anything but pain is impossible. Anhedonic states are incredibly frustrating - not so much in their inherent sense of displeasure and apathy

Despite my lingering self-awareness

Sleep is necessary but dreaded. Wakefulness is the only way to stave off the dreams, and murderously efficient.

The dreams change, and it is the thing I hate the most.

In those eternal heartbeats, content merely to be at my side. The waves of jet black hair flow gently down, down towards her naked breasts, rising and falling slowly in slumber. Lost, perhaps, in her own moments of dreaming, she sighs gently.

For a brief spell I am caught by the old enchantment, all is well; no pain or darkness could ever overwhelm the fortress of our passion for each other, and those walls will never crumble. None of the tortured imperfection of my mind can deter her. Nothing can stop us.

Our future is unassailable: the family, all the dreams and pleasures of life packaged up neatly and represented by the promise of what is yet to come - all symbolized in the intertwining of our resting bodies. In that corporeal crystal ball I can perceive all the happiness and joy that I crave: my unborn daughter, the beach house atop a rocky cliff, snow-capped mountains in the distance, quietly humming fans in a datacenter... all the random and unkempt snippets of thought that can still bring a blip of light to my world.

And then, to feel that warmth again in my soul, to cling to any shred of the positive that I can possibly unearth.

Everything dissolves - not quickly, that love cannot die.

The awful truth barges in

And even as I breathe in sharply - half from the brutal shock of it and half wishing for one last whiff of her scent to be lingering in the air - I know that I lie here alone.

Alertness returns in a surge of agony. She is a lie - a falsehood, to wrack my emotions with tantalizing impressions of what will not be.

I've noticed a lot of people

One of the major things that got me thinking about this is that people with Bipolar II are not supposed to have mixed episodes, which disqualifies me from a BPI diagnosis. I'm certainly not qualified to diagnose what officially constitues a mixed episode, but this experience has definitely made me feel like while these constructs are useful as diagnostic tools, they don't necessarily encompass the breadth and complexity of Bipolar Disorder. 

The other thing I've noticed is that there is a very widely spread misconception that Bipolar II is a ""milder"" version of Bipolar I, according to one study I read, ""individuals with BPII use significantly more violent and lethal methods than do individuals with BPI."" (This quotation is from the second link at the end of this post) I think this probably has a lot to do with the fact that while hypomania is a milder form of mania, the depression that people with Bipolar II experience is equally intense and usually occurs with greater frequency, as people with BPII cycle more rapidly. There's also the fact that hypomania, despite its reputation for creating elation and productivity, is not always a positive experience--mine will often manifest as insomnia, over-sensitivity and anxiety. So defining Bipolar II or even Cyclothymia as ""Bipolar Light"" seems incredibly problematic to me. As suggested by ""Psychosocial Impairment Associated With Bipolar II Disorder"" (link number three)

So anyway, take some deep breaths and just focus on dealing with whatever symptoms you're experiencing and getting to a healthier place. I'm unconvinced at this point of the objective existence of said boxes. I think it's important to remember that while these distinctions are helpful when it comes to diagnosis, at the end of the day they are relatively simple constructions imposed upon what is an incredibly complex disorder, of which science doesn't yet have a thorough understanding. 
That's my two cents, here are a couple of them.

As always, unable to summon the energy even to stumble down the hall to forage for a half-assed meal.

This time around

The title pretty much sums it up, vaguely platonic sense like some artists might express, but virtually overwhelmed with eroticism and lust.

There is no satiation for the appetites in this frame of mind; no light of moderation glimmers in the stifling tunnel of endless nudity and sexuality. Female attention has become a double-edged gilded sword - priceless and coveted but almost repulsive in its enigmatic aura of lethal danger. It is safer to suffer this onslaught from within the walls of silence and imagination; to dare give voice to the thirst in real life would certainly spell immediate ruin. I have a good life - too good to sacrifice over a diseased

The slightest scent of sweetness becomes the mingled sweat and perfume of an imagined lover. The warmth of blankets and bedding echoes the presence of another body that does not lie there. I lie in mute torment, debilitated monster like me.

All lines between reality and fantasy have long since blurred. The day is a haze of inattentive daydreaming; the night is punctured by waking moments

No matter how many times the tatters of my healthy mind try to remind me, loathing my own self-image of a leering, slavering man lost in a jungle of obsession, loving every moment and breathlessly careening forward into the abyss of unrestrained carnality.

I am alone, or enjoyable pastimes; so how could I be made to suffer over a want of these things? But love is another matter, and it rings dully and horribly true that we always want most that which we cannot have.

The mere fact that words are flowing freely is a warning sign unto itself. I never write unless I am on the verge of a major episode, only a parched paucity of words and a gnawing desire to communicate things which lurk beneath the surface of understanding... until it all descends into hell. The great irony of my condition is that I communicate best when I have the worst, most unspeakable things to say.

I fear now, and simply vomited my prose onto the digital page in vain hopes of catharsis.

I wrote a little review on the quality of its depiction of manic depression - (love story aside

This movie may illustrate the real *life* of a bipolar person (one who experiences relationship problems and impulsivity), and planning to read all of Nikki's books is an example). This behavior is hypomanic but still not severe enough to match his diagnosis and the hype surrounding it in the movie - he's taking 2 antipsychotics and lithium and is supposedly ""severely ill"" but doesn't have depression (not shown) and doesn't have full mania. And his hypomanic tendencies are showed only 2-3 times. The rest of the movie focuses on his anger problem, for which he needs treatment more than anything. Unfortunately, the movie does a disservice to manic-depressives because it implies that this aggressive behavior is natural or typical of most or all manic-depressives, which is NOT true. They portray a bipolar person who doesn't have actual bipolar symptoms - they illustrate him struggling with his anger problem, being provoked easily, and violently exploding at people. But these angry bouts do not co-occur with depressive or manic symptoms - they're just part of his  personality. So this movie may illustrate the *life* of a bipolar person (hence why so many people here are relating to it - but should absolutely not be generalized to all bipolar people)

In real life, I am frightened. Interactions with strangers or people I don't know well often frighten me. I don't know how to get beyond small talk and form real relationships with people I don't meet through a friend. I don't even really do any activities that let me meet lots of people.Attention makes me uncomfortable; I want the conversation to proceed in a predictable manner and I want to feel a sense of control throughout because a lot of the time I feel like I can't think of replies on the spot.

I thought it was all just my social anxiety getting worse and worse. I knew I had trust issues and a paralyzing fear of rejection that I feel is completely warranted after all of the fuckups and failures I have been through. But I realized it is more than that. I am afraid to be myself. Maybe that's part of the fear of rejection and my self esteem is really that shot. I would rather just not open up at all than take any sort of risk even if it means no possible reward of connecting with others. Just hide behind witty comments and irony and hope that random improbable conversations will come up where I can showcase my intelligence. Hope that if I dress well people will just come up to me even though I feel unattractive.

Having to compromise your dreams so you can live a feasible life is maybe for the better in some ways

It can be really hard though to have these grandiose

Some of the dreams I have had that probably won't come true, c'est la vie.  Travel to Portugal or Marseille, France, go to the Mediterranean and learn to sail.  Learn another language.  Start a band and play, harmonica or guitar or drums.  Learn to play Clair de Lune, Hungarian Rhapsody no 2 and C.R.E.A.M. on the piano.  Go to a music festival or rave.  Fly with a wingsuit. Get some poetry published, write a novel.  And I won't even get into the fantasies about girls

So most of those I can still do I guess

Here is something my psychologist(who I haven't talked to in 3 or is it 6 months? I have been doing well by myself I believe, ideas only carry you so far, has to have action and will.

We've never faced anything like this before and we aren't sure what to do. If he goes to the hospital without any ID, so we're worried that he might not go with the EMS. The nearest family member lives 11 hours away, or else we'd be driving to find him.

My dad left me when I was two.  He left me with a bipolar mother.  She was on her 2nd marriage at the time... one out of the four that would devastate her.  When he left

The care home was across the street from us and after school I would go there.  Over about a year I was raped by the caregivers

My mother got married when i entered the first grade. He was a violent man. A lawyer.  I grew up with five women, but he'd give me the courtesy of a free arm.  I would catch it or get nailed. 

My new stepfather threw me against a car when I was in 4th grade and broke my nose.  I remember my mother apologizing for me.  I had acted up

He started cheating on my mother when I was in 6th grade maybe... right after he lost a city council election no less.  He beat my mom good.  

I'm 28 now... I looked through her box of pictures... a mess of material from the past all thrown in... and there were pictures of her bruised and puffed up face.  I got used to the cops coming to the house.  I got used to hiding in the closet.  

They divorced when I was in 7th grade... At this time

During 8th grade, broke a lot of glass, and threatened my new stepfather.  The cops were called and calmed me down.  But after they left I broke everything in the house.  They came back and they strapped me down to an ambulance and took me off to the ""basement.""  I was institutionalized twice in the next year.  Bipolar.  Type I.  

My mom couldnt handle me and so she decided to ship me off to a different country to be with my father at 15.  He tried to be a dad

I met a girl and got her pregnant.  Abortion was illegal in this country so we had to go to a back alley doctor.  I was so fucked up that I forgot the date of the appointment and so she went alone.  We thought everything had went well.

Four months later, she gave birth to a still born baby.  I called our doctor and he told me to cut and tie the cord.  The baby?  I remember exactly how he looked...  Her mom took the baby.  I never saw HIM again.  After all that, as I was lying next to her as she was resting, I fucking fell asleep.  Can you believe that shit?

I spoke to her years after.  She told me she was hospitalized for PTSD.  She had tried to kill herself.  She relives that moment over and over... and every time I fail over and over again.  

Later that year I was arrested for grand theft auto and possession.  It worked out for me

I went back to the states when I was 19.  I got my first job at a theme park and I went back to school.  I isolated myself.  I started even sleeping in the bath tub.  Because of something... i started burning myself.  Hate.  Regret.  Desperation.  I dont know. 

I had a bad relationship.

After all that I went to community college.  I took psychology, english, and histroy.  I stayed there for 3.5 years.  I read and I studied and I tried to bury everything from the past.  And I did that well.  

Right before I went to a UC

But at law school I just fucking crashed.  I convinced my psych teacher that I was adhd...  He filled me with a bunch of adderall... you know what happens next... I just couldnt handle the pressure anymore.  I felt like I had been racing to be something I wasnt.  

I left after a year... with 40k in debt.  I moved down south to be with my girlfriend.  I love her dearly.  I'm taking all these psych classes in hope of going to grad school in psychology.  We're getting married soon.... We just had our first pre-marital counseling session...

But im so tire fellas... im tired.  Im crying right now.  I don't know if I can go on...  Every day I pretend that my life has been the same as everyone elses... i smile and wave and shake hands... im charming... 

My pre-marital counselor referred to me as disabled last night... I try to give my fiance so much... but sometimes i just cant sleep... and sometimes i just feel down... I try to compensate... but sometimes its not enough...  Im just tired guys... and i feel like burning myself....

Ordinarily I wouldn't share these kinds of things with anyone; the stigma and ignorance that surround mental disorders is staggering

I went to a local support group earlier this afternoon. It was an overwhelmingly positive experience; there's nothing quite as reassuring as starting to describe your torment and having someone else jump in and finish your thoughts for you - knowing that other people walk through the same chasms of hell. But even in that context, I felt like just a projection of my self; as if I was playing a role, watching myself do and say things that seem real but are just shadows of the truth.

I've been through enough psychotic episodes to recognize the sensations around depersonalization and dissociation. It's not dissimilar to what I feel now

Part of all this is chronic isolation. I live alone, stacked in the dining area. I go to work, pretend to be normal and OK, and then come home and go to sleep. There are no gaps, no openings into which reality might creep unexpectedly. I live in a bubble of my own making during the day, and then disappear into unconsciousness when I get home, racing to escape the prospect of having to contemplate my life.

There are social occasions in there, grabbing dinner, getting together to play some music, whatever else. Superficially, it seems fine; well-adjusted, normal, call it what you like. But nobody in this area aside from my doctors even knows I'm bipolar. I have fabricated a lie about myself so intricate that it conceals all evidence of dysfunction - often even from myself.

Most of the time, I don't think about it at all. But at times like this, especially after openly talking about my situation for the first time in my life (outside of some posts here), it's impossible to escape.

There are so many aspects of my life that contribute to this isolation and alienation... too many to list, unfathomably foreign. And as time goes on, it seems that I do nothing but reinforce this situation with every choice I make.

What I find so frustrating about this is that it is utterly opposite of what I actually want. There are nights, dusted lightly with the scent of hair that never tumbled across it. The blankets huddle against the hips and breasts of the woman that doesn't lie beneath them, and in the air is the faint breathing of a soul I have never met.

In these moments of confusion, to know, even though it is false, that someone shares my life so completely that she would stay with me through the darkest and weirdest places I have to tread.

Biology, evolutionary conditioning - I don't know where this comes from, why it holds such sway over the deeper recesses of my mind, but there it remains. On the one hand, I don't feel incomplete; I hold no delusion that I lack a ""perfect person"" to come into my world and make everything better. Quite the contrary, I'm more or less happy with my state of affairs, with few exceptions; I'm well taken care of in all the material ways that matter

So long as I can banish the specter of _her_

I've heard all the answers before; everything from ""there's no perfect person"" to ""you'll find the perfect person someday"" to ""meh."" None of them ring true; all of them are easy to dismiss and easy to argue with. It's as if part of my brain wants this fantasy to become real so desperately that it refuses to listen to reason, will heed no logic.

I feel like no solution can be acceptable, I will simply walk away in disbelief.

All the things I wanted to say - like that I do believe in things, which is what agnosticism would imply, and that leaving christianity was one of the best things that ever happened to me - I couldn't say any of it.  She sensed that I was uncomfortable, and basically just went on to say, ""God saved my life when I was recovering from my mental illness.  I'm going to try to get you back on the God side.""

 I'm having problems locating the happy medium between how empathy is manipulable

I'm framing this in what is probably a false dichotomy, sometimes hourly. Is there a benefit from experiencing life from both extreme angles, or should somebody like me really try to focus on one or the other? (Cut the losses and choose to be either a nice, empathetic person who risks getting royally f'd over, or adopt a 'balls-to-the-walls' attitude that works his ass off and takes no prisoners.) I'm thinking sticking to some easily-remembered principles would be beneficial. Something I can habitually revert to regardless of my current mental state.

It could mean all the difference if you become severely ill and symptomatic and cannot advocate for yourself. (More information in expanded text including links to resources).,,21,1,9,"From the [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_directive):

&gt;An advance health care directive, advance directive, or advance decision, are instructions given by individuals specifying what actions should be taken for their health in the event that they are no longer able to make decisions due to illness or incapacity, and appoints a person to make such decisions on their behalf. A living will is one form of advance directive, leaving instructions for treatment. Another form authorizes a specific type of power of attorney or health care proxy, where someone is appointed by the individual to make decisions on their behalf when they are incapacitated. People may also have a combination of both. It is often encouraged that people complete both documents to provide the most comprehensive guidance regarding their care.

The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) has a Mental Health Advance Directive template on their site as a PDF file. You can download this PDF file

Here is the link to NAMI's template (Warning: PDF file!): [http://www.namigainesville.org/images/Psychiatric%20Advanced%20Directive.pdf](http://www.namigainesville.org/images/Psychiatric%20Advanced%20Directive.pdf)

Here is another link to the National Resource Center on Psychiatric Advance Directives: [http://www.nrc-pad.org](http://www.nrc-pad.org/). This website provides further resources and educational information concerning creating your own Advance Directive.

I recommend using NAMI's template to work from. Depending on what resources may be available at your outpatient clinic/therapist/psychiatrist's office they may be able to provide you with their own version of a template for an Advance Directive (I know that in New Jersey

To get into it a bit further, I **AM** the Messiah come to save the Earth. Something happens and an ambulance and police are called to deal with me because I am acting quite inappropriately in public and have become rather disruptive.

If I have filled out and filed an Advance Directive

I can also specify which medications I have been on before and whether or not they have had any success. I can specify that I am not to be placed on certain medications for various reasons. I can give my mother power of attorney over me because I trust her to make sound decisions regarding my mental health care.

For me, I have no desire for sleep or food. My eyes are opened wider and my senses feel heightened. Remarkably jovial and talkative, talkative to the point of interrupting sometimes, I feel like I need to comment on everything. Those closest to me say they like me hypomanic, but they are more than ready for me to calm down. Hypomania creates a caricature of myself. Invincible. Bigger than life.

One benefit of hypomania for me is productivity. Once my boundless energy is bridled, papers are filed, and exciting new lessons are developed. I never slow down and neither do my students. For middle schoolers, a hypomanic teacher is quite a treat. I talk a mile a minute, cracking jokes and pacing about the room, and we bounce from one activity to the next. Not many papers get graded, and tangential thoughts may invade my lessons, my hypomania

At home, since I see no reason why everyone can't unload all of their clothes from their dressers and get organized too. My hypomania once even inspired me to paint my office. Now that was a mistake. Not only did I choose a yellow the shade of an egg yolk, I painted with such unfocused energy and lack of precision that once completed, it looked as though the sun crashed into the corner of my house and splattered all over my office walls. Needless to say, I had to hire my ex-husband to come and repaint it. Talk about humiliating.

Another symptom of my hypomania for me is this incredible urge to create something and follow it through to completion to the exclusion of anything else. For example, I will not get up unless I am forced to by the demands of family or work. Even then, while begrudgingly meeting my commitments, I feel a magnetic force pulling me back to the piano. It takes all my strength to fight it. Confession: there have been days where I have gone to work and instead of going straight to my classroom to prepare for the day, I've snuck into the music room and spent my half hour prep time playing the piano before the music teacher arrives. Being creative becomes my primary focus. Then, on those same music mania days, I will return to the music room during my free period and see if the piano is available. Again

For me, even if my symptoms lead me to do dangerous or careless things like shop too much or drive distracted or worse. I crave that sense of elation so much I am willing to risk it. Nothing bad will happen to me, right? I am invincible!

Often at the end of an episode (not strictly hypomanic, and the long hard look in the mirror on Sunday morning is often brutal.

I guess I should preface this by saying it's been an extremely difficult and tumultuous year. Beginning May 2012 and continuing into this past winter, said goodbye to many of my best friends (we all graduated college and were flung either back home or all over the country) and generally lost my sense of self. Landing a high-stress, low paying job in my field means I always have a lot on my plate at work, and until a few weeks ago I was back in my parents' house to save up to move. The depression is waning slowly but surely, and I think I've made some progress, though that loss of ""self"" is taking a little longer to dissipate than I'd like. However, there is one bigger enduring problem.

Before I go further I think it's also worth mentioning that I'm what many people would call ""intense."" This is something I've never particularly liked about myself, and a trait that makes me arrogant and obnoxious for others. Again, this embarrasses me, but as far as I can tell it is genuinely part of my personality, and not part of my disorder.

A silly incident at a party recently (made a minor ass of myself in front of a couple of people after I'd gotten a few drinks in me; could've happened to anybody, is what bothers me the most. The low is always accompanied by a sense of crushing shame, and I am having trouble deciding whether or not I do indeed deserve to be ashamed. Aren't I still the person that said that annoying or over-the-top thing? Aren't I the guy that really just shouldn't have done ""that,"" gone ""there?""

I've been on Lamictal since I was 17 (approaching 23 now). My psychiatrist and physician have both said that my disorder seems to be mild enough that a very basic stabilizer like Lamictal should help me keep it together.

Does anyone have any insight on recognizing and managing the beginning of a hypomanic episode

Finally, or even something darker (maybe some kind of anti-social or narcissistic tendency)? Is it that loss of self I mentioned earlier (I reiterate, occurred over the course of a long and difficult year) that's making this harder? Or am I just being a jerk about keeping myself in check?

But no, so I walked up and started again, trying to help this guy understand and he just goes off on a rant about prices and stuff I have no control over and I just watch myself snap. It was terrible.. I slammed my fists on the table and yelled about not giving a fuck, to just leave and that I didn't care.

Well, and of course it went away pretty quick and I felt better. I figured he'd call next week and file a complaint, not sure what would happen to me then.

But then he called. He apologized for being rude, to me? I apologized as well, he forgave me and hung up. Wow.. what a roller coaster.

I known for the last 6 years I'm Type II Bipolar. I'm on medication but it doesn't completely help with the depression and i still have low level mood swings. I know some people are able to maintain a job dispite this but I don't know how they manage it. 

It seems with me I'm ok for awhile but eventually the stress starts getting to me (even if it's like cashier or something not high in stress) and I start having crying spells and panic attacks at work. I've had to call people to calm me down enough to finish my shifts. 

This has happened multiple times on and off meds. Every job no matter what I try. Any advice on how to maintain a job without getting swamped with depression or panicing? Or if not..

* I would be lying if I did not say that getting a disability lawyer to award me my Social Security benefits didn't help tremendously. Without my benefits a one month supply of Seroquel XR and Trileptal generic would run me between $800.00 and $900.00 USD.
* Daily exercise. I work a very active job and I generally walk between 9
* A healthy diet. I can expand on this if anyone would like me to. I've read that bipolar people tend to do well on high protein diets and my diet is certainly high in protein. I also eat a lot of fish as the Omega-3 fatty acids are great for we bipolar folk. I've read that straight from the fish is best so I try to cook fresh fish often.
* Strong
* Strengthening my relationships with my immediate family.
* Periodically reading everything I can get my hands on about bipolar disorder. I have to ask my psychiatrist for some good recommendations.

There must be others who aren't on medication. Why not share some of our experience on what life is like for varying degrees of Bipolar living off-meds (for whatever reason it might be).

disclaimers:

*Please don't attack me, links, anecdotes, encouragement and reasons why you should try it if you never have before. All I'm saying is that it wasn't for me and I wish I knew then what I know now. I'm open to meds in the future if need be, but as for right now, No thank you.*

**I am not suggesting that you stop taking medication. I don't know you

* Life without meds is messy and fucking difficult. I have ruined relationships and had to seriously accept some ugly truths about myself. It hurts, the nature of feeling, has matured and changed as I've tried to come to grips with my irrational pointless extreme moods.

* No matter how difficult it gets

* If it gets so bad that I feel I cannot keep that vow

* I will not go on medication unless I am 100% dedicated to doing it. No half assing, or 100% off them. It will still be extremely difficult, but I must be dedicated to finding the right substance / mix / doctor / dosage for me. I must accept that it will take months to accomplish this.

* I must accept that certain people / triggers / substances / situations must be avoided for the sake of my well being. I have to put my emotional well being as a higher priority to my impulsive desire to have fun and exciting experiences. If you seriously can not do this

* You can build a new you on the ruins of who you are. Positivity is possible. It might not be the life you expected to live when you were young, and knowing your patterns, will help a lot. Having a private accessible outlet, like a journal or sketchbook or tape recorder, is essential.

Me: 40/male/South America/Bipolar 2

There are many reasons to decide to be forever on your own because of bipolar. Maybe it's the inability to be what someone else expects, maybe you don't want to pass it on to your unborn children, maybe you feel ugly and don't ever go out there.

For me it was a decision made in my 40th birthday. I decided to definitely stop the dating game. Too many failures and they translate into too many frustrations. Also

I've decided to deal with it by going back to many activities I've left behind since I started living my ""single"" life (my last meaningful relationship ended 8 years ago). I've come back to yoga, and sometimes I may even have a one night stand, but it'd have to be something kept simple.

Hi every, but if you don't want to read I will, of course, include a TL;DR.

I am a 27/F. My problems began in my second year of college. Up until then I had been a stellar student; graduated High School on the Honor Roll, Scholar/Athlete, the whole deal. Started working in a pharmacy at the age of 16 and had decided my dream was to become a pharmacist (and not just for the money, I swear!). Got accepted into every pharmacy school I applied to, decided on going to college in Boston. Had a great first year at school, despite coming down with mono that spring semester. Second year of school rolls around and funny things start happening to me. Suddenly, I can't sleep. I don't mean, I mean awake for 36 hours and body won't sleep. I know things aren't right so I see the school counselor who told me it was nothing and wanted me to bring in a tape for our next session so he could tape some ""soothing sounds"" for me to fall asleep to and told me I didn't really have a problem. Needless to say, but now I had people telling me that I was fine and needed to just get past whatever it was

It wasn't until 2006 that I decided on my own to seek professional help because things weren't getting better and I had been in a relationship I was unconsciously sabotaging through my behavior (weird manic episodes, respectively. 

Things were okay for a while after that; I didn't feel full of crazy anymore, over my school, not well-being] I never thought it an option to *not* go to school. I had no plan, well to be honest I had many plans: one day I was going to become an EMT, another day a laboratory technician, whatever sounded like it could get me a job at the time. Took a smattering of college classes that didn't really lead to much, but raised my GPA enough to get into a local private college where I decided to just get my undergrad in Biology so I could at least attempt to go back to pharmacy school in the future. 

Family relationships have ultimately crumbled; my mother co-signed on my initial loans for college and when I was on hiatus they began coming due and I just didn't pay them. This has led to them going into collection, which she reminded me about non-stop and I feel like a fucking tool. We haven't spoken since last August. My father's side of my family (parents divorced) treats me like the black sheep. They have great relationships with each other, but no one talks to me unless they have to. It's...awful, and hurtful. I know I've let my family down in so many ways because of what I've been going through, but they all seem just as happy to write me out of their lives.

Fast forward to the last two years or so. I am trying and failing at college once more because I cannot get out of bed some days. Have taken two online courses through the university, at my own pace. Every other course is a D-. Now the sleep thing is happening again. I also have a job. It's a great job in a pharmacy I like, but some days I just cannot get out of fucking bed. And when I say some days, I mean most. About 8 months ago my boss had to pull my health insurance because I wasn't netting 20 hours a week. Now I net between 8-10 a week. I am actually surprised I have not yet been fired, and I really think it may just be a matter of time now.

I truly don't know why I can't get out of bed/leave the house. My alarm goes off, not today. just don't feel like it."" I have no health insurance so I cannot see a doctor. Well, I could, but it would cost quite a bit of money out-of-pocket, money which I don't have because I work so few hours. A vicious cycle is happening. I haven't been able to afford my meds so I stopped them a few months ago. At that point, I wasn't convinced they were doing anything anyway, but couldn't see a doctor to get adjusted or re-diagnosed. 

So here I am. I am almost 10 years outside of high school with no college degree. I look like a lazy fool in front of my work colleagues. Because I have no degree I have a generally low-paying job and I have a ton of debt and a credit score that can't buy me a bicycle, I've contemplated suicide more than once. 

I think my next step is to apply for SSI/SSDI (not actually, and there is one school (here in the States) that has a completely online program for my Pharm.D, and I am one class away from having my pre-requisites complete to be accepted. Only problem, I'm positive my GPA will not qualify me anymore, and I have to give up my dream.

In middle school I started having relationships with overage men and tried various plots to escape from home and start new lives in faraway places. 

I struggled throughout High School until my hospitalizations Junior year where I was diagnosed bipolar after a SSRI induced mania. 

Throughout my life it was like everyone was so scared of what I'd do next that

It's been a year and the meds work. They make me stable and I can have smooth emotional states where I have a continuous energy level, invite me to hang out. It's what I've always wanted...to be included.

But so much is gone. I never knew how much of me would die at the hands of mood stabilizers...My opinionated, my creativity, my intensity, the devastating quality of emotions and sensation....

I went off my meds and now I'm depressed beyond anything I've experienced before. I went off because I need to do some creative writing for a class project...but I also want to be *interesting* again. I want to feel like the person I've been all my life.

But, but what about...just me? 

Between not inducing the hypomania I need to complete the project that is due in days and coming to the realization that I am naturally an unlikeable person...defective.

Im not suicidal but I give up. I have been a writer my whole life and have been published a few times or journalism. I know I can write. Im working on a novel and I believe that my unique experiences in life is going to give me a valuable unique perspective on life. 

Im at the earliest of early stages of starting a magazine with a man I met through reddit. 

I have projects that I am working on 

Im just lost. I have maybe two friends that I see about once a week. I have the semblence of normal but I dont have an apartment and I dont have a car and I dont really feel like I have more than 1st world problems which are problems but not really.

How bad are hospitalizations for ones life happiness? I feel like a freak because Im not psychotic enough to be a true mental patient and I am not healthy enough to be a true upstanding member of society. I have a college degree and a disability diagnosis from the government.

This is all I do. I sit and I write and I am trying to create my first novel story and its going well. I love the story I am writing. I am working on a franchise manual for a vegan restaurant and he loves my work.

this might be the last slow year I have but this could be my entire life 

I dont need a kick in the ass 

I need to take my psychosis and paint pictures on reality that people can learn from. 

This is what I tell myself. I tell myself that I live with my parents in a nice house and this is an opportunity to write. To pen that novel and see if I have a novel in me. 

We spoke and I am going to be not applying for work for the next year and work strictly on my novel. I am 345 pages into it now and that is after spending 2 months working to get my last book of poetry on amazon.

It took me ten years to graduate from college and i majored in five degrees before i finished with english literature. i know mental health problems are heavy in the literary world and i am no different.

I want to start something but i dont have the resources to begin. I tell myself that there is no difference between you and a CEO of P&amp;G they just have been doing it longer. We all sit at the same keyboard its your mind state that dictates your future. 

My parents basically tolerate me and my brother wont talk to me and my sister wont acknowledge me and my other brother lives in california. 

I know if I went somewhere and just lived a homeless life I would be satisfied if the weather was nice. 

Im a bum. Im not corporate

I know I probably sound strange but does anyone else have high intellect  and a strange life history involving mental health problems?

I tested into the 92% percentile of the air force entrance exam some two years ago. I did well on it.

I feel like my intelligence should know how to get out of this and land me entrepreneurial work that can lead me to sustainable life. 

How do you start a business with nearly $100 a month total? I mean I dont know I am trying to help people by writing books for them and have a client right now that I am working with. I have my own book and a friend is also interested but he probably isnt serious.

I take the bus to get around town but that turns a simple chore into a day long procedure which ruins the ability to get a business started. Im just kind of lost is all.

I have high functioning problems the ability to start a business but the mental history that symies that. 

This doesnt even feel like a post that will make much sense and this is the type of person that I am and this is what i talk about and this is why I am ignored but not really ignored because this is pseudo intelligent speech but its not really.

I dont even hate life I just look at it. Do you ever stare at life? Just looking at it wondering how this could be real? I mean isnt just a life enough? Do not all of my problems stem from greed? The want of money? The want of family life? The want of success? Isnt that greed and the essence of greed but isnt that even a thought that gives me permission to be poor.

Arent I trying to give myself permission for this life I have? I am seeking permission for living with parents at 31 and writing and doing nothing else. I know people have to work and they provide me with everything I have but I am not one of the workers

I doubt that I will ever see the light of day financially to even live in an apartment.
I doubt that any woman could ever love this. 
I doubt that I will ever see my own child at the dinner table eating their tofu sandwich.
I doubt that I will ever find someone to love me in this entire world because I know that if I find that person I will screw it up.

I've felt this way all my life. Or at least, I'd still have endless energy. Other times I'd just be an empty husk of former life. My thoughts always raced. I'd get extremely angry at myself and was prone to doing things like hitting myself in the face if I felt I had done something extremely stupid. I'd wish harm on myself when I fucked things up.

I went through my high school and college years like this. I dated people and had some very meaningful relationships. I tried to put all this away in some deep drawer somewhere inside me. I told myself they were just personality flaws I had to work to change. When I failed

I'll admit, I prided myself on my mind. I was convinced I was overcoming things by power of will and I already knew I was smarter than most of my peers. People have done nothing but confirm that. Mental illness was actually my biggest fear in life because I thought that without my mind I was nothing.

Last year, she was my teacher. I don't know what it is about her, but I liked her from the moment I saw her. It wasn't physical attraction. I thought she was cute but that wasn't it. She looked like a nerd (which is a complete turn on) but that wasn't it either. She looked intelligent, which is a must for me, but that wasn't it either. I still don't know what it was. I didn't fall in love right there. I just really liked her and told myself ""Her, I will date her."" And I did. I dated the grad student who taught me (she's a redditer too but I doubt she'll see this and I don't want to drag her into it) and it was great. It wasn't manic like my other relationships. I got depressed a few times but there wasn't anything too bad. All in all, it was the most normal time of my whole life. I knew she was leaving the city (and state, we drove from Florida to New York to return her parent's car. I had agreed to help her drive it up and she bought me a plane ticket back down. I figured it would be a free vacation and a last outing with the girl who was soon to leave. We realized on the trip that we had failed at out goal: we had fallen in love and we didn't want to say our goodbyes. She was moving across the country but I agreed I'd follow her 6 months later once I graduated and was applying to graduate schools. I've never been happier than I was that week up in New York. We loved each other and for once in my life it all felt real. We daydreamed of the not-so-distant future and I guess I was a little more honest than she was. I really did want that future. She left on her trip and we began to be long distance.

With her gone, although I tried. She couldn't wait for me. She had suspected all along she couldn't wait, but she said she genuinely wanted to try for me. To this day I'm still not sure if I'm honored that I'm that desirable or offended that my well-being was played with in such a way.

That was the breaking point. My defenses had come down and so much stuff that had never been dealt with was now out in the open. I've been in therapy with both a psychiatrist and a psychologist for 3 months and I haven't gotten any better. My psychiatrist keeps telling me I need to be patient and I'm trying to believe her but its just too hard. I'm becoming impatient with trying to get results from a medicine and my condition is getting worse. I can feel my sanity slipping from me. Instead of hearing someone whispering to me I get the distinct feeling something was just whispered to me. I get easily distracted by sounds and I focus on them; They amplify in my mind until they are all I can hear. My thoughts race; I think so fast it feels like by the time I finish one thought I'm already halfway through another. 

I know some people have it worse than I do. I know some have it better. I don't know what I expect from this but if you read this far

1294446830.0,ey7ub,PSA: Antidepressants Alone Can Trigger Mania In Bipolar Disorder,applextrent,21,2,17,"**Disclaimer:** *I am not doctor

**Antidepressants (SSRIs like Prozac, Lexapro, and SNRIs like Effexor, etc.) alone can trigger [rapid cycling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder#Rapid_cycling), [hypomania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania), [mixed states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_episodes), or [mania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_episodes) in someone who is bipolar. If someone is bipolar and taking an antidepressant they should also be on a [mood stabilizing medication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_stabilizer) (Lamictal, etc.) or [atypical antipsychotic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypical_antipsychotic) in addition to an antidepressant ([1](http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=11217)

Within the last several years many people have sought help from their doctors for depression with anxiety, [mixed states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_episodes), or [mania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_episodes) shortly after starting treatment on antidepressant medications, and then are diagnosed with [bipolar disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder). When this happens it means that the person likely suffers from some form of [mood disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_disorder). It is important to see a psychiatrist to determine which mood disorder, as there are many mood disorders, as well as several forms of bipolar disorder and they are treated differently. A general doctor is not qualified to make a diagnosis, you must see a psychiatrist or psychologist. Since [bipolar disorder is a spectrum disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_spectrum) between mania and depression it is not the same as [unipolar depression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unipolar_depression). With what is now known about bipolar disorder we know that antidepressant medications alone can trigger [rapid cycling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder#Rapid_cycling), [mixed states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_episodes)

If you are only on an antidepressant and believe you are bipolar and experiencing [rapid cycling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder#Rapid_cycling), or [mania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_episodes) you should contact a psychiatrist immediately. If you do not have a psychiatrist you can contact your insurance company for a referral, or if you are a student you can contact your schools counseling department. If you do not have insurance you can find more resources on our [Do not self diagnose; Steps to getting help PSA](http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/ev419/psa_do_not_selfdiagnose_steps_to_getting_help/).

--------------
Bob and Tom are sharing a hospital room. Separated by a curtain they acknowledge one another's existence but no words are exchanged beyond

When the doctor enters the room, as he did today, Tom makes his way to the hospital for a special injection to find relief from the pain.

The doctor asks Tom, ""I was at an 8 and now I am relieved at a 4. I feel so much better."" Tom is still in a fair amount of pain, but it's to a degree that he can now tolerate.

The doctor then moves to Bob. Bob is in because he broke his big toe. He had it set and was given a boot to wear. The doctor asks Bob the same question, ""I was at an 8 when I broke it, a 5 when I came in and I'm at a 4 now, but only when I walk on it."" Bob is honestly still in some amount of pain. But is Bob's pain as severe as Tom's pain?

We can assume the Tom is in a fair bit more pain than Bob. But if we look only at the subjective scale that each of them used

I would rather not copy and paste the text of these two articles. Some of the information included in the articles is incorrect and

On July 6, slowly getting more eccentric as the days went by, but I am a bit 'weird' on any normal day so people thought it was just a phase I was going through. I was a heavy abuser of many different types of classical and designer psychedelics, stimulants, and cannabis, which I feel heavily contributed to the severity of this particular episode. I woke up Sunday morning and was receiving special messages from the TV news, from the radio, way far out there on another planet. I had many delusions, and an FBI agent at times. I am not religious

I easily could have died, for treatment. I am very lucky to still be here, and not just from this incident. I have come so close to death on many other occasions.

My family, as the police searched the lake but could not find my body (some of my clothing was found at the lake bed), and my body did not rise to the top after a certain amount of time (it was assumed that I had entered the lake and drowned. I had entered the lake, but I got back out again). I was presumed dead. I remember hearing a bird calling my name. I followed that bird for most of the day. I waded, swam, and floated through Farrington lake for a good part of that hot summer day. I was eventually picked up by a New Brunswick (North Brunswick?) police officer, who dropped me off at the New Brunswick train station with cut up, pockets full of mud, what with the resurrection and all.

I have had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder since I was 17. I am now fast approaching 31 years of age, being in and out of treatment (inpatient/outpatient) for going on 14 years), in hopes that I may somehow one day get it printed. I am one of the few who was committed to the adolescent state hospital Arthur Brisbane Child Treatment Center (due to poor care children have died there). Fortunately Arthur Brisbane was closed down many years ago. The place was a shithole.

(Here are two articles about the Arthur Brisbane Child Treatment Center:)

* http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/16/nyregion/inquiries-to-focus-on-conditions-at-child-centers.html

I have also been recently considering making bits and pieces of my story available online in the form of a podcast/MP3 download (I could do Youtube, Youtube has a HUGE audience. If I do get my story together it will take time to put together a manuscript and get my documents in order. I'd like to do this in the near future.

I haven't ever posted the news articles before, mainly from this manic/psychotic episode of 2008. I now no longer user this username anywhere online apart from /r/bipolarreddit.

First

2012 has been an incredible year for me, stopped beating myself up quite so much over every little failure, started taking better care of my body, and became more physically active.  Outdoor sports were pretty central to this whole process, and have helped me to improve my fitness and my mood control.  I've also spent more of this year on the manic side of things than ever before- although I've gotten a lot better at channeling it into healthier avenues of expression; more running, physical activity, and cleaning

I have really embraced the Jekyll and Hyde/Hulk metaphors, they are; and ""manic me"" is the one I consider to be my true self. Even though Manic Me sometimes does regrettable things (hence the username), he at least *does things.* Which got me thinking- how would Manic Me communicate with Depressed Me?  After all, the two are never in the room at the same time.  

Well

So I did.

My forearm now says, he will be forced to think about it, and maybe even follow the instructions.  

It says ""Always keep moving forward.""  

Loosely interpreted

It's a message from Manic Me to Depressed Me.  It's *the* message that Depressed Me needs to hear

I'm 18. Growing up, good creative outlets - I was very hypersensitive, but luckily I was never exposed to anything that really messed me up. When I was 12 I started to sense something was wrong. I'm an extremely introspective person and am always aware of myself. I know when something is wrong - but this thing that got inside my head made me very self-deprecating. My mood fluctuations, my constantly shifting senses of self-worth, my growing confusion, I attributed it all to puberty.

For 6 years this thing grew inexorably. My sense of self-image was distorted. I was absolutely convinced *everybody* loved me one day, then be normal, then be bad again. It was primarily depression, but there was a few brilliant moments of what I can only describe as hypomania. Every time I started to think something was wrong this evil little voice in my head, this thing that hated me in its entirety, would just kick me to the ground telling me what a shit I was for thinking something was wrong. It told me I was an attention-getter, it hounded me for feeling worried about myself when I had the best life.

Then shit got really intense for about a year, I had a great group of friends, I was really coming into myself. But on the inside shit started to break. I can only describe it as having a sharp metal screwdriver shoved into my sternum 80% of the time. At times I was brilliantly happy, and philosophical, and life was *beautiful*. At other times I'd have to escape to my car or bathroom to scream and bang my head against a wall, or I'd fall into fits of paranoia and seize up because I was *convinced* the world was too big to be real, and that I must just be a part of an experiment. I didn't understand where my emotions were coming from. They were so powerful but I couldn't attach them to anything.

Then one night I had what I can only describe as a visual hallucination (I had a couple more minor ones afterwards but none of them were auditory, I was not suicidal; at that point in my life I was more spiritual than I have ever been. Part of my brain remained firmly rooted in rationality and it never let me do anything stupid. For that reason, the shrinks didn't pressure me about seeing a psychiatrist, even though they highly recommended it. I think they realized that I was waiting for another scary thing - another hallucination, or manic episode - to happen before I finally motivated myself...

Then one day it disappeared. I literally woke up in early December and it was gone. Nothing in my life had changed. There was no great epiphany, astounding gift that I took for granted because I was so preoccupied with the pain and paranoia. Now it's gone and I can't get it back, but I am finally functioning like a real human being and not terrified of myself. I'm really confused - what happened? Is this possible? Can my brain just change overnight?

It is troubling because I never got an evaluation from a psychiatrist. I stopped talking to my shrinks since there was nothing to talk about (they all told me to call them first thing if I ever feel like it ""came back). I don't know if this is normal

#1

The single most important thing to your recovery is finding skilled, and it cost me 5 years plus every relationship I had plus every thing that I owned (including 2 houses).

If you think the helping professionals that are working with you suck, borrow, steal, lie, cheat...whatever it takes.  It probably takes less than you believe, but even if it takes more find these people.  This is a fight for your life, and the right people on your side are the only way you have a chance.

For the record

#2

Listen to these trusted professionals...they have real wisdom that will change your life in unbelievably good ways.  If your impulse is to resist what they have to say, invest your entire existence in believing what they have to say.

#3

You might need medicine.  They'll tell you.  You might need specific kinds of treatments or therapies.  They'll tell you.  Listen to it all very carefully

""You are accountable for your own thoughts and feelings"" 

and 

""Choose the thoughts that you attend to carefully"".

I don't know what she wants or why she decided to start talking to me again, he instantly came up with all these ways I could have avoided putting myself in the problematic situations in the first place. I just kept feeling so stupid that I didn't have this knowledge that so many other people picked up on; I guess this is what I could have learned if I wasn't busy destroying myself with drugs for three years before diagnosis. My friend even invited me to come out with him a few nights so he could set me up and teach me some tricks but that frightens me more than I can describe; I am afraid to be in an unfamiliar environment with unfamiliar people having to constantly put myself out there and constantly face rejection while everyone else there actually knows what they are doing and has confidence.

Now she stopped contacting me because I fucked things up. I just starting revealing personal details at an all too inappropriate time and part of me feels like I subconsciously did it on purpose

I'm sick of rejection and failure. I actually had the courage to ask this girl on a date in December and she didn't even respond. I felt so stupid and looking back at what I said it was completely fucking stupid. I can see why she didn't respond. I wish I could actually think for two seconds before I opened my mouth

I'm sick of this shit, only for them to randomly pop up again. How did I become so pathetic? Why the fuck am I so weak and emotionally unstable? Everyone else can brush off rejection and handle their shit, why am I such a miserable piece of shit? I'm still too afraid to approach people thanks to that fear of rejection. It seeps into other aspects of my lives and is slowly eating away at me. It's a never ending cycle of failure and pain and misery, why am I so fucked up emotionally?

All my friends are getting into relationships and enjoying themselves. I haven't even met someone I could potentially date since my ex and I broke up in August because I have been too fucking afraid to even try. Why am I so alienated and isolated from everyone else my age? University has just been overworking myself and fear of failure and the even worse fear that another breakdown could be right around the corner. I've missed out on so much and I can't even meet people. For all my intelligence I can't figure out any of this. I'm sick of watching my roommate bring women home and then listening to them fuck while I lie in bed alone knowing it's going to be that way for a long time. Why am I so fucking stupid? What is so repulsive about me? I thought I was a good person but apparently no one can see that. Am I just inherently unlovable or did I do this to myself by being such an emotional cripple?  

I just don't want to be alone. I've been dealing with this for years and it seems like that can't change. I am sick of being taken advantage of. I'm just sick of everything. WHY THE FUCK CAN'T I BE A FUCKING NORMAL HUMAN BEING?????

I don't know what the point of writing this was supposed to be. This has always been a painful point for me and yesterday just brought it right to the surface. I was too upset to make it to my classes today, especially because it's a friend, and I have no medical equipment or anything. I just can't get a fucking break.

As a quick summary, and that he was coming to take her away.

I was going to give an update last weekend

How are things going?  Well

She actually asked me to read the letter to make sure it didn't sound 'too stalkery'.  In it, and said that she'd love to meet up for coffee some time 'as a friend'.

The letter certainly had some assumptions in there that would confuse him.  She talked about how she saw him at a hospital (which I believe to be part of the delusion

We've had talks about where we are at.  Her statements are that her head says she should stay with me

And when we are talking about the future, or staying with the status quo.  She does not seem to recognize the possibility that if the connection between us has been lost that we could work at it to rebuild it.

But

She has talked to me about moving to the West coast from the centre of the country.  In her mind

I've explained to her that there is no way I am even willing to talk about moving until we have decided about our relationship.  She seemed to think it would be a good idea to move over there 'as room-mates'

I also told her that right now my focus is on trying to restore our relationship.  But, and that may not include her living with us as room-mate.

On Saturday we had a discussion where I explained my fears to her.  That we would move there, and that with the added hours I'd need to work, I wouldn't be able to take care of the girls, so would lose them too.

Her response was she was afraid that if we split before moving

I got a kick out of it when she spouted out one day that she didn't see why she had to be the one to move out and find a new place if she left.  My response was

But

Today we had our first couple's counselling session (a month or so ago she wasn't interested in the idea as it would be a waste of time).  I have no idea if this is going to help or not

One thing that was quite remarkable that she mentioned last night is that she sometimes still feels like she's getting better.  I encouraged her, and starting to be concerned with more things than just herself.

There is still a lot of room for improvement

Right now, but the thought of anything physical between us - even holding hands - disgusts her. We were talking this evening after the girls were in bed, and she said that she wished she was still attracted to me, and that we had a connection.

This is possibly the first time that I've heard her say that since her hospitalization, so I don't have any objective statement on how things are going.  

However, that is telling me that since he hasn't moved her to a maintenance dosage, he must still be shooting for improvements.

This is a throwaway, and I know I’ve been a little different since I was about 14 or 15. I’d go through these cycles, and every few weeks it was as if I were a different person. When I was depressive, I’d have suicidal thoughts, as many of us do, and when I was manic, I was ridiculed for being so hypersensitive to everything. 

When I was 15, and through all of his. We seemed to be on opposite schedules, which is kind of funny in retrospect, but we were both very obviously bipolar. For lack of support, we clung onto each other. As our relationship became more and more destructive, the harder it would be for us to separate. When I was manic, I’d realize that I couldn’t talk to him anymore, I’d always come crawling back. 

Now, even though any kind of relationship with him ends with me crying, shaking on the ground every night. I feel like I need him. I know this obsessive behavior is beyond unhealthy, but I can’t help it. 

I never thought I’d be bipolar, and the next she’d hit me for crying, followed by apologies the next week, and more verbal abuse after that. Unfortunately, I’m 17, and my family is convinced that mental illness is invented by big pharma. 

It wasn’t until my general doctor suggested finding a psychiatrist and looking into bipolar, and it’s nothing compared to this horrible beast I feel inside of me whenever something strikes me wrong. 

After visiting a clinic and being diagnosed with Bipolar II

My mother always told me she called the psychiatrist to try and get an appointment, that I realized it wasn’t me. 

I’ve waited so long to get this off my back to someone I feel could actually understand me. I feel so helpless and trapped and burdened by what I am, but you guys know how it feels.  

I guess I’m asking for advice

**EDIT**: Thank you everyone for your kind words and advice

Yes, I gave up. I didn't know where to look, where to start, and absolutely no one in my life wanted to help me. I couldn't even figure out where on Reddit to turn to for help financing college. The whole process is like a mountain of bureaucratic crap that I could not navigate, my chest is getting tight thinking about it. 

Bipolar disorder runs in my family, so they deserve special treatment. They refuse to acknowledge that maybe I don't get along with them sometimes because I'm bipolar too. This is also how my friend is about my bipolar. He thinks his is more important, so I should have a panic attack because it inconveniences him. 

Regardless, but I really care about him, even if it's difficult for him to return the favor. He's also my only channel that understands me. He's the only other openly bipolar person I know, and he's the only person that will listen to me talk about what I had for breakfast as well as pat me on the back when I'm in hysterics because the push pin wouldn't go into my wall correctly.

I was released back home and haven't returned to the psych ward since. My prescription was fairly standard - Seroquel, an anti-depressant.

After a month or two, coming from other people who could somehow read my mind and were trying to control me. I found a way to obtain marijuana again, and I was working at the time (at the same job as I am now, fortunately) so I was able to fund my own habit. But my parents eventually found out.

I treated people like shit

Well, they weren't going to see me kill myself mentally under their roof.

I had some savings

I later brought my guitars and amps down with me. I'd like to say that it was music that saved me

After a girl I had loved saw me manic, half-baked, to win her back when I finally decided to sober up for good and make music a sustainable career; to finally re-enter society and stop listening to the voices in my head which I fully acknowledged as auditory hallucinations for the first time.

It didn't work out that way though. How could it? People rarely change.

I had a hope though, helping to make the world a better place in my own way and as a human being worth admiring.

Friends, it is in all of us to make life better for ourselves, and to bring real happiness to the ones you care about. 

I stopped all drug use

1324747402.0,np9iq,a probably unpopular question that should be asked and i'll do the dirty business...,QiChi,29,10,90,"How many people are posting on this reddit who are not diagnosed as bipolar but think they are and *in posts say the* **are** *bipolar?* How do you

A lot of people think they are ""bipolar"" but aren't. You may be cyclothymic or something, you could be nothing, you could be anything but I feel until you are bipolar as determined by a professional, don't give yourself qualifications you don't have. You can be ""sure"" from ""research"" you've done and other people could have told you you're ""bipolar"" and you could ""fit the criteria"" but that's not how diagnostics work. If you *want* to see bipolar in yourself, well, you'll see it! 

**It could have reprecussions beyond what you intended.**

I find it insulting and degrading to be honest. This disease has ruined my life.

As for people who are posting as SOs and friends of people with bipolar asking questions

HOOOOOKAY edits:

My solution is people who feel they may be bipolar but are undiagnosed should say ""i think i am bipolar and..."" instead of just ""i am bipolar"" when responding to posts. ADHD and BPD and schizophrenia (and arguably MDD) share traits with bipolar disorder. In case someone is mistaken in their feeling, a sign of responsibility, magnamity, courage and respect. 

Also, undoubtely. Just, suffering bipolar without help is not the way it has to be. 

I agree people who think they may be bipolar should reach out into this community, the pending bipolar posts, the i think i have bipolar and connect to this replies...that sits very well with me-i think it makes them more likely to reach out for support in the real world.

I don't think anyone here would be happy to know that we had a hand in someone's drinking
I do think personal attacks on me are unwarranted and not progressive. Putting me down doesn't help you or me or the problem. Reddit is a sort of think tank. I admit I lost it, not people**.

Also, pro drug use, or pro suicide comments made in anger. if you're really having it balls out with someone, just...don't say things that we all know you wouldn't say in the real world to me if you could see me...i think everyone who got upset, including myself, are good people who got frustrated.

**Special Thanks to anyone and everyone who noticed I was posting in a bit of a hypomania and was out of control and acted to make people aware of this to protect me from being attacked...which was only escalating the hypomania.

1307211630.0,hrmfl,"What does being ""Bipolar"" mean to you?",Jahmon,20,2,24,"Hey all

I discovered this Reddit recently, and hear the experiences of others, makes me very happy.

A bit of a tangent

I personally don't like to associate myself with the term ""bipolar disorder"", it carries unpleasant connotations. That is why I refer to my experience as part of a condition, or simply as my experience. I am not denying that I have a chemical imbalance of some type, and I am taking medications to help me exist comfortably in 'normal' society. I simply don't embrace the rest of what the 'disorder' implies. Personally, I've had many beautiful experiences with this condition, and I've learned a lot from the negative, so I disagree with people who treat my experience as a crippling illness that I will never recover from. 

As I said, and think it is offensively narrow-minded. I refuse to accept a label that, to me, places me in an almost sub-human category. Though I have made mistakes, and behaved in socially unacceptable ways (which I don't want to repeat), I will not distance myself from my mind and psyche. To do so would be denial. 

So, as opposed to what medications you are taking and how they affect you, and the pressures of getting by in daily life (unless it is relevant to what the disorder MEANS to you).

I'm curious :)

What are your experiences using weed to self-medicate? Or just to manage your condition? Ultimately what I'm asking is


For me, I could be wrong and the weed could even be the thing responsible for triggering manics. However, I personally use it to stabilize my mood. Since I'm always anxious, it helps me relax. Synonymous to someone having  a glass of wine after they home from work, except that I'd rather take a hit. I've also stopped drinking. For a number of reasons but mainly because I don't like myself on alcohol (only hard alcohol, I love a good beer with dinner) and because I just prefer weed and it's mellow loveliness. I adore it for helping me relax but I'm also afraid that I withdraw from social interactions because of it. I don't know... what are your experiences with it?

I've been paying my Sister $500 a month to take care of my two dogs and paying for health insurance for her (which is about $400 a month) since January. I moved to San Francisco for my business, and I thought she loved them.

I left them with my Sister trusting her to take care of them. A month ago she stole $700 from me

Not a word since I got this voicemail informing me she gave the dogs away. She lied to my Brother and a few other family members claiming I didn't love them anymore and didn't care (I'm amazed no one contacted me to confirm this
 
I never in a million years thought she was even capable of doing something like this without saying a word to me. In retrospect I should have never trusted her.

Next 6 years,ended up  living in parks, started using crystal meth and fell deep into deep into pychosis.  Had to call 911 and have him sectioned under the mental health act ( had no idea at the time what a totally exceptional experience we had with the police, they were terrific)

First hospitalization:  3 weeks , all I might add paid for by our Province. Thank God for our health care system....really feel for the other folks posting here that are struggling to manage without!

Second Hospitalization: December same year, he had a minor legal infraction (graffiti) so rather  than taking him to the hospital, the police took him to jail and then released him the next day with no assessment and no notice to us.  After three more days of struggle, finally got the right cops at the right time to bring him to the hospital… 3 week stay .

Third Hospitalization: January,  now has a warrant and is taken back to jail and again not accessed!  We turned up in court, and working with the court appointed lawyer, the crown prosecutor dropped all charges, he was accessed and taken to hospital.  Turns out he and another  patient had been doing crystal meth while in the hospital during the last visit so of course he ended up back so fast.

The Author explains that there is this idea that has developed in medical history that mental illnesses are fundamentally different from physical illnesses; that they are a disease of the mind and not of the body (and of course vice versa). He continues to explain how this distinction is misguided and actually helps to perpetuate social stigmas around psychological disorders. Mental illnesses can include many physical symptoms (fatigue


**Here's where he starts relating this to public attitudes (if you don't read the article at least read this part):**

""Unfortunately, still encourages many lay people, and some doctors and other health professionals, to assume that the two are fundamentally different. Both are apt to assume that developing a ‘mental illness’ is evidence of a certain lack of moral fibre and that, if they really tried, people with illnesses of this kind ought to be able to control their anxieties, their despondency and their strange preoccupations and ‘snap out of it’. It is true, that most of us believe in ‘free will’; we believe that we ourselves and other people can exercise a certain amount of control over our feelings and behaviour. But there is no reason, phobic anxiety or depression should be able to exert more control over their symptoms than those suffering from myxoedema or migraine. There is a further and equally damaging assumption that the symptoms of mental disorders are in some sense less ‘real’ than those of physical disorders with a tangible local pathology.

So, and when I left, the sun came out of the clouds, and I felt very positive.  The feeling has stayed with me, and I've been a lot more upbeat.

As I mentioned in the last post, when I said I had picked up my wife at the hospital she had been visibly upset and had to leave the table.  

I gave her the flowers, and thanked me.  I was blown away!

She went out with a support group to the theatre in the evening.  She was very anxious prior to leaving, and whether she would meet her soul-mate there.  Of course I wasn't happy that she's still having thoughts about the guy, but I was very happy that its changed to being worried about seeing him rather than wanting to see him.  And, when she came home, she had had a great time with no issues.

I've told her that she is welcome to talk to me about anything, she's not confident when the last time she saw him was.  (The last time would have been 10 - 11 years ago, when he was the HR person at a company she worked for....)

She still firmly believes he's her soul mate

She's helping around the house

A friend and I had done some drywalling in the basement to get a retreat set up for her, and the girls were watching in the TV room.  She asked if we could watch in our room, and so we were lying on the bed watching TV for a while.... 

I've made sure she knows that while I understand she doesn't have any desire to be in a relationship with me right now

So

Do they seem to be getting better?  I think so.

We went out as a family to the zoo on Saturday.  It was great to get out and do something with everyone.

1327619019.0,oy9ul,"""Is it possible to undergo a profound crisis involving non-ordinary experiences and to perceive it as pathological or psychiatric when in fact it may be more accurately and beneficially defined as a :spiritual emergency""?",swoodmings,19,3,21,"&gt;Spiritual emergency: “Both a crisis and an opportunity of rising to a
new level of awareness.” 

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2009 after I had entered a state of ecstasy so powerful I thought I had died and was headed for heaven. It was the most profound and important experience of my life. Unfortunately, and institutionalization. So, rather than ""being saved by God"", I was hospitalized, put on heavy medication, and told I couldn't recover.

After two weeks I crashed and was back in consensus reality: which made me really depressed. I did not know what happened

Then I found others who had similar experiences and put their crises in a more positive story (see examples below), and learned how to manage my feelings in some sense. This new look was the best thing that could happen to me. I haven't had any true depression in the three years after the first experience (while before I truly was a manic-depressive) and with the support of friends and my new outlook on what the bipolar manic crisis was I was able to work through it when it happened again in the beginning of 2011.

What helped for me was putting my 'disease' in a positive narrative instead of the devalued story that people are trapped in. Especially [Sean Blackwell's BipolarOrWakingUp videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=iv&amp;annotation_id=annotation_458663&amp;src_vid=Db8AYSrs2kk&amp;v=BnsTNEXMRL8) on Youtube told me the story that I thought it was. In a nutshell

I highly recommend his videos (watch the first 5 which takes about 40 minutes) for a different outlook on bipolar disorder. Watch them [HERE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=iv&amp;annotation_id=annotation_458663&amp;src_vid=Db8AYSrs2kk&amp;v=BnsTNEXMRL8).

**What are your thoughts on this? Can you equate the bipolar manic crisis with nirvana in Zen, he also looks at the negative sides: like [paranoia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZIQSCu4K_0) or ""[the dark night of the soul](http://www.ofspirit.com/bobolson40.htm)"".)


Similar ideas can be found in [the book Stormy Search for the Self](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Stormy-Search-Self-Personal-Transformational/dp/087477649X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323120366&amp;sr=1-1) and [the ""spiritual emergency blogspot""](http://spiritualemergency.blogspot.com/)

(NOTE: if you are like me and exploring alternatives to the mainstream psychiatric system

/edit kilokhan said that there need to be peer-reviewed articles to support the argument about alternative treatments. There happens to be a project that treated people without medication (in a more ""spiritual"" way). This (suppressed by NIMH) 'Soteria' method without medication is just as or even more effective than with. See for example [this](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1939-0025.1975.tb02556.x/abstract) and [this](http://journals.lww.com/jonmd/Abstract/2003/04000/Treatment_of_Acute_Psychosis_Without_Neuroleptics_.2.aspx) article about Soteria
&gt;a sustained emotional relaxation became a main therapeutic focus which was not primarily achieved with neuroleptic drugs, open, family-like, protecting and relaxing setting as possible.

That type of treatment without medication proved to be just as effective or even more effective than with drugs.

But the big days seem small, a year?  Who knows anymore.  I can't keep track.  My past is present.  Everything that happened to me decades ago -- my whole life -- isn't so much passing before my eyes.  No.  It's just all here.  SItting on my shoulders.  Crushing me under the weight of it.  I am simultaneously conscious of everything that I have ever done.  I'm conscious of every way I've ever looked at a problem.  I'm conscious of every book I've ever read, every song I've ever heard and every movie I've ever seen.  It's all here.  All of it.  Right now.  It cripples me.

I close my eyes and I see, in vivid detail, a cacophony of images screaming towards me like a surrealist's flipbook.  I can see the perfect moments but they're fleeting.

It's what makes me want to change -- myself and the world around me.  It's what makes me see the things that I see on a daily basis.

I'm honestly not sure what comes after the pain.  I've never been in this mindstate long enough to wait that out.  I have days of the pain to flip through.  Weeks.  It makes me afraid to close my eyes.  I can see it in my mind's eye either way,False,,t5_2qzru,False,,,t3_li2dr

I've been baker acted 3 times in my life. Twice in middle school

This most recent time, they just threw me in there, no explanations of rules or anything about the place. It was a very confusing and scary experience. There was an old lady that kept talking to herself about murdering girls. They also kept the drug detox people in there as well. We were kept mostly in two small areas of rooms. There was a room with tables and chairs, then another area with a locked up TV and rows of chairs. There was about 25 total people in there including me at the time. The only ""activities"" available were they had a few coloring papers printed out and some crayons. Then whatever they had playing on the TV, which one of the entire days was nothing but football.

The first night I was there, he spoke to me asking me very.. manipulative ? questions for like 3 minutes and wouldn't listen to anything else I had to say explaining what happened. (These days I tend to be very in touch with what's going on with me.. I recognize what happened, why it happened, why it shouldn't have happened and knew how I was feeling.) Those three minutes were about it.. I talked to one of the workers there at one point who said afterward she was 95% sure I'd be let go after just another night of observation to make sure everything was okay. 

The next day.. no word of me leaving, ""oh. you should have said something to me before the doctor left, which he already has."" it was about noon at this point I think.. Gee.. thanks for letting me know about that and what times that asshole of a psychiatrist would be there. 

The whole experience was both depressing, a book to read and some word search books to keep me busy. (Although I had to return the crayons to the staff when I was finished using them.) You sleep/wake up when they want you to. They kept forgetting about me though because I guess when they brought me in, there was no beds in the rooms available so they just had me sleeping in one of the isolation rooms. I didn't really mind that though, I would prefer being alone to being in a room with several other strangers. They feed you terrible, unhealthy, disgusting food. (isn't a healthy diet a part of mental well being?) One of the lunches was 2 rolls with two packets of peanut butter.. (is this prison?) There is an outside closed off area but I can only remember being let out there like once for 15 minutes during my stay there. (isn't fresh air/sunlight also important to your well being?)

The whole conversation began because when I was depressed on Sunday, so I knew he didn't have much time to talk. There was nothing wrong with that. What was wrong was the way he tried to rush me off the phone and after listening on the other end I knew why: his gf, who doesn't like me, was there. This hurt considering she has done some terrible stuff to me in the past.

I called him the next day about it, even when I was depressed because ""it could've waited a few days (even one day is unbearable)"", ""you're not like your cousin (who attempted suicide the previous week)"", and ""it would've taken a long time (it's not about the amount of time with me)"". That (long) conversation turned into him saying he couldn't be there for me anymore.

After I said that I could see he has decided that my behavior is unacceptable as a patient (as I had already decided he's unfit as a therapist for patients who require dbt) and he's still shakily trying to write down names for me. I reiterated how frustrated and upset I was and that I didn't know what I was going to do (and caught myself almost threatening suicide, because I'm upset and feeling let down and abandoned by this guy and desperate that I can't get help

I basically make it home and crash (sleep). I wake up and decide that I need to figure out what my deal is, the posts are awful posts about how terrible people's girlfriends are and the typical attacks on women in a male dominated enviroment, and then I proceed to read about borderline personality disorder on wikipedia. At this point I feel like I'm doomed with a terrible, frightening, and untreatable disease. Reading people's posts I feel like the Frankenstein Monster in the novel, where the villagers are going to hunt me down with pitchforks shouting ""Crazy Bitch. Burn the Witch!"" There was a short period of time (maybe a half hour or less) where I felt really, really bad and frightened that I could be borderline. 

For some reason though, which sounds like a fate worse than bipolar, I didn't know this was possible. Reading Marsha Linehan's works in the past I had more of a empathetic concept of borderline personality disorder, she really is probably the only person who treats this disorder kindly. I think I do have some of the ""traits"", which are going to make it difficulter than bipolar (because meds don't help entirely solve the problem), but Linehan makes is sound solvable. 

It's still a little scary though. I know I say things that upset people, I've read about terrible, horrible things men have done to the women who are with them, and I think how the hell is it that they have someone in their life and I don't? Not that I want a dysfunctional relationship, but I would really like to meet and be with that (monogamous non-cheating) person who understands me, who can see past the ""disorder"". I also have a lot of tolerance (and am faithful in relationships) for other people's crap, and people have thanked me for listening and being supportive of them when they feared others wouldn't (though I wondered at their lack of support, and that it's ""natural"", though I worry that there are still remnants that I haven't overcome). The end result is that I can see and understand abuse from both sides

1363011826.0,1a2zgb,Update: February update for my situation,shell_shocked_today,15,0,13,"Good morning

Its been a while since I've posted an update, in Sept, my wife had her first manic episode (that we're aware of) and ended up being hospitalized for six weeks.  The diagnosis was bipolar with psychotic episodes.  

One of the key delusions she had during this period was that she was a princess, pulling all the strings making events happen in her life for the past two decades.

If you're interested in seeing the whole drama play out

I'd love to tell you that everything is back to normal now.  I really would.  Unfortunately it would mean that I would be living in my own little dream world too....

Not much has changed since my last update.  My wife is still on Olanzypine (20 mg daily).  Her common complaints are that she feels emotionally numb

She still has an attachment to her former manager, and that is what she is missing.

Originally she had committed to working with me until July before leaving.  Now she seems to have committed for another year

She enjoys cuddling and holding hands and talking in the evening, but that we're good friends.

We had gone to a therapist available through my work's employee assistance plan, we have our first session with a psychotherapist.  Hopefully enough time has passed that my wife is ready to start working on the relationship.

Recently I posted an update wondering whether she might be entering another episode.  It appears I may have been premature on that.  She had had a week of bad sleep, she has gotten a presecription for a sleep aid to be taken as needed, has had two weeks of good sleep, and seems back to normal.  Obviously one thing I need to be watchful for in the future is patterns of sleep disruption.

One thing that is good is that a 'bad day' now is so much better than what a 'good day' was a few months ago.

Thanks for reading

**TL;DR**  No real change in our status.  We're starting to see a psychotherapist today.

In September my wife had her first 'major' episode, who would come to take her away.

One of the things I noticed with that episode is that **everything** that happened was related in her mind -- there were no coincidences.  And any random person who did anything **had** to be related to the manager or be operating on his orders.

My wife is on Olanzypine (20 mg daily), **must** be related  to the manager because he had blue eyes.  

She spent a half hour last night talking about how all the different people from 10 to 15 years ago must have all been working together with the former manager.

Now, or whether she had stopped thinking like that.

And

She had an appointment with her pdoc today, so I don't know which one)

So

 * talk about my concerns to her?
 * wait and see how this progresses before doing anything? (I'm hoping the sleep will help restore her balance)

I'm leery about talking to her pdoc about it

(For anyone looking for the backstory

**Summary**

My wife was diagnosed with bipolar at the end of August, and that a white knight (former manager) was coming to rescue her and take her, and our two girls, away.

**Current**

Its been a long

We kept Christmas / New Years low key, and my wife was definately *not* in the Christmas spirit.  Normally she is big into decorating the house, getting everything ready, etc.  This year, she put minimal energy into it, and even the tree wouldn't have got done if I hadn't started it...

Christmas day went well though, although she started getting distant as the evening went on.  I'm assuming because of the 'expectations' of relationships, intimacy, etc. that are associated with midnight.

After New Years, cuddling.

Then, obsessing over 'the guy' that she has been crushing on, and being distant from me.

But, we hug regularly, and cuddle at night.  So, big improvements have been happening!

As well, she's present, and we are able to socialize and have fun together.

And, so she is **starting** to have feelings towards me again.  And that things also feel right when we are doing family things together with the kids.

Yes, and 2013 is looking a lot better...

TL;DR 2012 sucked.  2013 improving.

So, and the doc is now giving her some unaccompanied passes as well.  

She spent last weekend here, and then will be discharged on Thurs.  As she has misunderstood some of the timelines that the doc has told her in the past, I'm not putting this one at 100%, but it seems to be close to what the doc told me last week.

However, and we talked about it.  She still believes that her white knight, her soul-mate, is coming from Australia for her.  

But, and was proud that she hadn't 'freaked out'.  When she was admitted to the hospital, she was suffering physical reactions (racing heart, out of breath, feeling faint) when she thought about the guy.  Now she thought she saw him, and just proceeded on with the girls and me.

And, she has no interest in trying to work on restoring our relationship.  She has flat out refused any counselling at this point, as it would be a waste of time since ""there is no spark between us"".  Right now she wants to set up a room in the basement and move in there.  She's come to realize that she won't be able to move out right away without totally disrupting the family, and probably making us lose the house.  She wants a stable environment for the kids, (and me to have custody) and has agreed to wait to the end of the school year before actually moving out.

I like that - it gives the meds more time, that she will want to work on the relationship after she makes further progress.  My response to him was that I realized that at the end of the process she may still decide that she doesn't want to be with me - I just want her to be able to make that decision rationally.

The pdoc does not THINK she will take the kids and run, I've advised the school that I would like to be called if anyone tries to take our daughters out of school (I can't stop her from taking them out as she has not been declared non-competent, and there is no legal custody document).

Questions for the peanut gallery:

1) The day that she comes home happens to be our 9th anniversary.  It obviously would not be a good idea to make a big deal out of it.  Yesterday, and had to leave the room to collect herself.  

On the other hand

2) Should I talk to her about her delusion?  Or just let her bring it up when she is ready?

3) In the past she has NOT been good at remembering to take medication.  I think she wouldn't intentionally 'forget' to take them

I experienced full-blown psychosis and went into a dissociative fugue. Time stretched on endlessly and when I woke up in the morning I felt like a week had passed. My friend had to get on the phone with other people I knew just to convince me that I was alive. To say that the experience was overwhelming would be a serious underestimation. I started bawling with joy just because I was alive. I went to sleep thinking that I needed to either try to sleep and wake up from this coma or try to kill myself out of it.  


I always assumed that I knew enough and did my research on drugs. I have tried weed, and shrooms. Right on wikipedia it says that lithium users can experience a dissociative fugue. Drugs can be very fun and introspective when used properly, but here I fucked up big time. It is a miracle I am even alive given my state of mind. I was stupid and assumed nothing could affect me even with my disorder. 


To end on a more positive note something snapped in me through this experience. I don't know if it is because I felt like I went through a near death experience but I woke up today and knew exactly what I have been doing wrong with my life in the past year. I devoted my life to weed and escaping and lost my high school sweetheart of 2.5 years. I had no motivation and my grades were terrible. I blamed it all on my ADHD and bipolar. I never took responsibility for anything in my life. I have to live and deal with this disorder but it doesn't define me, but don't let them control your life. They can make conditions a lot worse and impede a normal recovery from an episode. And for anyone on lithium who has or wants to take LSD: Use extreme caution. Even if you are not on lithium LSD can cause you to go manic or psychotic. Don't be an idiot and fuck around with this disorder. I am lucky that I didn't get hurt, and that I woke up feeling reborn and ready to take on challenges I've been avoiding. This is the only life I have and I'm not going to let my disease determine my fate. And to all who feel hopeless, aimless, lost or confused, don't give up. You are still you and no matter how bad things seem to get only YOU can decide to do it right or not. Don't skip your meds. Don't spend all of your time just wasting away. Recognize that you can deal with the ups and downs and be the awesome creative person you are meant to be.

This lead to my second hospitalization and a medication change (which is so far so good).

Now for the gritty business.

I just suffered from the first episode I've had in about 6 years.  It was one of the WORST mixed states I've ever had.  I hadn't had a full night of sleep for close to a month, but I also lacked any motivation and felt very hopeless.  My anxiety was overwhelming and I was having several strong panic attacks a day.  Some were so bad that I would collapse while holding my chest.  After suffering for as long as I had I decided that I needed help and admitted myself (with full support from my SO) to the local emergency Psychiatric ward.  I've been there for well over a week now and I have been switched Seroquel every night and Epival twice daily.  I am feeling much more stable and am luckily suffering zero side effects from either medication.  My SO took it upon himself to move us out of our old apartment (which was one of the key reasons I had stopped sleeping, ant problems and the like) into a great new apartment.  I've been spending more time talking about and dealing with the things that I've been bottling up inside and I'm hoping that my bipolar will go into remission for several years again, if not longer.  As hard as it has been to be stuck in the hospital day after day, I feel like I made the right decision.

Two weeks later I went to see my boyfriend who lives about 100 miles away which is when my moods started going out of control. For the last two weeks I have been at rock bottom I repeatedly hurt myself and attempted suicide while I was with him. There were many times that I was close to being hospitalised and the local mental health unit was called at one point during the week.

The whole event is fuzzy but I know that it was hard on my boyfriend.He had to call the samaritans at one point just to keep himself from losing his own mind and I saw him break down because he had to cope with 3 days straight of little sleep and making sure I didn't hurt myself.

When I got home I was still struggling and my best friend here on the request of my boyfriend had to keep an eye on me and make sure I went to the doctors. This meant abandoning his first date with his without explanation.

My mum drove across the country at record speed to look after me and take over when my friend needed sleep.

I am back on the tablets now and slowly getting control of myself. I feel stupid for getting this mess but if anything good has come out of it I am finally getting proper psychiatric help instead of the doctor going here take these meds and nothing else.
 
My boyfriend said that when he was talking to the Samaritans he was asked if he considered leaving me. Apparently when he said that he wouldn't they then asked if it was because I was unstable.He said no it was because he liked me :P.

When my boyfriend first saw me have a episode he didn't run instead he came here and asked you for help.

So Thankyou to my Mum, and thank you reddit for helping my boyfriend help me. There is so much support here and I read stories of people in horrible situations and I am happy to see all the support that there is.

I'lll start off with some history about myself without getting too personal.  I was diagnosed with Bipolar when I was 14 years old, and diagnosing me was challenging.  I was originally diagnosed with depression, as I hadn't had a manic episode, however a short stint on Paxil changed that.  From there I had been on many medications, and am now happily on Lithium and Trazadone.  It took a very long time to find a medication balance that I was comfortable with, and even once I did I felt that something still wasn't right.  I felt like my moods were stable, but I was still exhibiting a some of the symptoms that I was informed were related to bipolar.  I was having anxiety issues, and other times I would be totally numb.  When I went over this with my psychiatrist, even with the medication.

In working now with youth at a counseling center, I saw that a lot of the symptoms between the two are almost identical.  Things like:

* Anxiety
* Overactive sex drive
* Anger/Irritability
* Numbness

The list is a lot longer

The reason that I'm saying this, as I tend to trust health care professionals, but there might be something else going on.  I've always felt that it's worthwhile to find out, so you can begin to get the right kind of help right away.  Counseling can be a great side treatment to help deal with the Bipolar regardless, but I feel that it can be more comforting and validating to know exactly why I feel the way I do.  It's nice to give it a name.

For one, dramatic, wishy-washy or what-have-you thing, situation, or un-diagnosed person as 'bipolar.'  
Example:  ""Becky got mad at me when I forgot to pick her up at the airport.  She is SO BIPOLAR."" or ""I hate it when the garbage disposal doesn't work. It can be BIPOLAR sometimes.""

People draw their swords when the term 'retarded' is used, it is extremely hurtful on my end. 
What do you do when someone says this enough to bother you but you don't want to disclose your diagnoses to them?  



On another
Another thing that I have experienced is, un-diagnosed and un-medicated.  I started to realize there was something terribly wrong.  I studied night and day, I never did anything for myself, no friends, no hobbies.  Just school school school, trying to keep up academically.  I worked harder than anyone I know has ever worked at school or their career.  But my grades were terrible, and getting worse and worse, I got diagnosed through the school's medical and counseling centers with Bipolar Disorder and began seeing a psychiatrist. I was never advised to take a break from school and get healthy and get my shit together so I could be more successful.  They loaded me up with so many drugs then that I had to drop a class because I slept through a test because of side effects
That was a year and a half ago. I have worked at the same vet clinic for 3 years and have advanced from an assistant, promoted to head vet tech and office manager. I have been stable for 9 months and regularly see a therapist.  I work 55+ hour weeks and I am still ok and have friends and a life now.  I have learned a lot about how to manage this disorder.  But I just feel like I need to finish what I started, and get my degree.  I have now changed my career plans,  and want to be an animal behavior counselor. This entails changing my major to Psychology.  I spoke to the dean of the college and he flatly told me that he believed I want to study this area in order to understand my disorder better, and that he sees people like me trying to change their degree to Psychology all the time.  He sent me to an advisor.  She basically gave me the same vibe, even though I discussed how a background in psychology would be most beneficial to me in doing what I want to do.  She gave me her card and told me to email her with any questions, and then never answered any of my emails.  These two people are the ones who decide whether I get re-admitted to the university and neither seem too eager to give me the time of day.  

What do I do?  Would anyone else consider this discrimination?  Has anyone ever dealt with something like this?  I am not sure how to move on with my education or career with complete resistance on behalf of my school due to my psychiatric history.  I feel like if I was anyone else they would have been happy to help me get back into school (and take my tuition dollars)

*here's part 1 if you missed it.

*When Will It End? My life in New York - This panic attack. Over? 
*Not yet. There’s too much to do before I die. I had about 15 dollars in my pocket. 
*I was travelling in a Toronto train station when the symptoms began to take hold. 
*I thought it was the two cups of black coffee and the 8 vodkas the night before - pushing me into overdrive. 
*I was definitely abusing my brain, understand, or describe why it was different. 
*I spent two hours in transit on the train, dry heaving, calling friends long distance and trying to ask them for help in some way. 
*I was in a different kind of panic. I told my best friend I thought I had a mental illness, just breathe, and understand that you can control this on your own."" 
*Over the course of the next couple months or so
*I needed a doctor of some kind. I soon learned that a milligram of Xanax or four ounces of courage would put a stop to the shaking
*When will it end? I kept thinking. After I find love? After I make my movie? After I get some sleep? And morning after morning, 3 AM shaking and immediately shoot four ounces of anything, and turn on some kind of media to distract me from the anxious thoughts. 
*It was very surreal and at some point got peaceful. it was a dangerous cycle to get used to. First it was Vodka, 
*or the song that reminded me of that person that broke my heart

*
*
*


*Part 2

*I was lifted into an oasis of humility. I started to get that peace and love was so simple
*Especially on a particularly crowded C train. It was obvious to me. 
*It didn’t seem obvious to the rest of them. Nothing really phased me for a while. The nausea was gone. 
*The suppression of the urge to order white pizza at 1 AM was quickly overcome. 
*I was so stoned once, little Mexican dude, just started laughing at me with no remorse 
*because my little apartment basically erupted a thick spreading cloud of smoke into the hallway. 
*He just laughed. And laughed
*He knew
	*Crazy. Yeah. I’m crazy. I told my psychiatrist that my mom stole my Xanax just to get more. 
*I learned about Pharmacy’s. I learned that you can take the same prescription to several different pharmacy’s to obtain the controlled substance before your dose changes in their system. 
*At some point in January, and the outrageous amount of vodka and whisky I consumed gradually stopped helping me sleep. 
*And when I couldn’t sleep, meditative media that made me feel that everything was going to be okay.
•I was back. I was back to waking up at 3 or 4 am, and drunk before sunrise. 
*I had no clue how bad this was going to get. A good friend told me it was ""just a phase"".

My daughter is turning 10, talked in full sentences at 8 months old, but had a VERY short fuse. As soon as she was 1 1/2 we knew we would need to get her help - she screamed for hours about getting dressed in the morning, getting changed for bed, brushing teeth, the length of her sleeves, being at the store, and were told it was sibling rivalry since we had just had a second baby. This did not explain the night terrors that would awaken us with screams almost every night that she could not awaken from for 30 minutes or more.  We dealt with this with patience and we bend over backwards to help her cope. We live in a very expensive area but I stay home with her and even homeschool her part of the year so that each school year she can start going gradually rather than jumping in suddenly.  She has social problems so school does seem to help with that.

Fast forward 6 years.  She has extreme anxiety, and so much frustration with everything she's doing that we have difficulty doing anything together. We can't take her anywhere without a blowup, and unless she's watching a movie or playing video games, she's hyper and making random sounds.  It's difficult for us because we know how smart she is, and yet she can't seem to sit down for a minute to just enjoy what is happening to her at the moment.  We start to see a cycle - a week of relatively good behavior and stable mood, followed by a week of screaming and insane laughter.

We finally get a new family doctor, at age 7-8 it has a side effect of having her start developing breasts early and we decided to take her off of it.  She seems to remain very stable for 6 months, and almost 'normal' or whatever people define as normal. She takes a break from the psychologist for a little bit, and some of the stuff she does just seems more like regular kid stuff, although now reflecting back probably not.  She doesn't understand appropriate sexual boundaries with her siblings, starts swearing at me when she's in trouble, but is able to get dressed without screaming and actually enjoys going to school.  The sexual stuff isn't extreme

Then we hit 9 and she begins spiraling into depression again. She begins to sometimes say she wants to die. We get referred to another pediatric psychologist who supposedly specializes in this kind of thing.  We spend a year going back and forth every two months (because he's super busy), and it doesn't explain any of her other issues. It just defines her as disobedient, which she is to the extreme. He puts her on fluoxetine (Prozac), which barely does anything for 6 months and then gradually does nothing. We cannot increase her dose because it is as high as it can be for a child. We do an assessment, which says she's typical for ADHD. She's beginning to have trouble at school for the first time, mostly because she is having inappropriate conversations with groups of boys at school, then getting teased for it and bullied.  

So I go do some reading about ADHD
She falls into everything on the left column, and moving my next appointment date two months farther into the future (which means we had to wait 4 months instead of 2).

I am heading back to our family doctor who is awesome and I'm sure I'll get more results from him, especially about medication?  Abilify and seroquel were going to be the next possible medications for her. Thanks for reading this long thing!

TLDR: My 10 year old daughter has struggled with cycles of depression (even sounding suicidal) and hyperactivity with crazy laughter since she was little. She can be obsessed with sexual topics. She can sometimes be extraordinarily helpful and then the rest of the time she is the most disobedient child ever.  I have been struggling to help her and fight through the maze of the medical support available to us.  They say it's possibly ODD and ADHD but I have doubts.

I had a late onset of bipolar. My symptoms started at age 29, been degrading steadily since it all started.

My old friends are way ahead of me in almost all aspects; they have a family, even when I am without symptoms.

So I’ve been establishing new relationships since, feelings, relationships, the future, the past, music…) no one follows or answers anything. So in short, I guess the intellectual level is pretty low, but I feel so alone when I'm with them that many times I just come back home and watch the same movies over and over.

But, they’re growing apart… getting better jobs and establishing with SO’s. Also, when I met them I still had a sparkly personality so I guess I was cool and fun to be with, which is now shadowed because of a permanent state of anhedonia. I feel they’re starting to figure out I’m not fun anymore, and who can blame them. I’m really not passionate about anything anymore… I literally have no desires for anything! This has led me to desperation and, even being unstable, I requested my psych that we do something. We lowered the stabilizers a while ago but I don’t feel any change.

I had been treated for major depression for about five years prior and tried several different types of medication and nothing worked.

When I took the medication the right way, it worked. (I say the ""right way"" because for a long period of time I would take it sporadically, which just made everything worse...) Everyone in my life noticed a big difference in my moods. I still went through mood swings, but they were more manageable. My psychiatrist said that I am more than likely Bipolar Type II. 

I have not been medicated since March. I felt perfectly normal for a long time

I apologize for the lengthy background information

What got through to you when you felt alone? What can I say/do/get others to do to show him there are more people that care about him than he realizes? How can I show him that while his parents are his parents they do NOT need to be his only source of support and love?

The doc talked to me about overnight passes for next weekend, I don't want her to have an overnight pass.  He took note of that, and took the overnight pass off the table for the time being.

Last month I received an unexpected letter in the mail saying that due to 3 F's

This meant I no longer had insurance and no financial support except for my part time 4-8 hr/wk job. I went through several emotions when I received this news. The first was relief because I struggle in school. But then I felt like a wreck.

So here's what I did:
* I immediately called my county's behavioral health department and set up an appointment to see a counselor and psychiatrist so I don't run out of meds.
* I contacted my university's Office of Disability Services and my Graduate Director to see how I can get back in.
* I finished all the required work for the F that was supposed to be an I
* I appealed to the department who appealed to the Graduate School on my behalf (that's how the appeals process works at my uni) and I'm going to class now
* My appeal was granted and I'm currently appealing for my financial aid.

Good right?

Despite this

I'm happy that I'm back in school

&gt; I hate myself. Why do I have to be the way I am? I go against the grain of society and life. I'm not fit for success in this world. I'm doomed to repeated cyclical failure. I see the hole in my path and I still fall into it. How am I ever supposed to live a good life? I'm always going to fuck up. This will never stop happening. I keep writing these appeals and I say I'm better now and this time I won't fail, I'll just become unmotivated and depressed. I'll just regret the fact that I was born and stay in bed. I'll want nothing more than to end my life. But the guilt and the fear of doing so stop me. Yeah I can attribute these feelings to my illness and seek help. But when does it stop? When does the misery end? When do I stop failing enough to be successful so that I can be content? I just keep screwing it up over and over. What happens when I can't appeal for my money because I got fired because I'm incompetent at my worst times? How do I keep a job? How do I get a job after losing another one?

Shinzen Young (a meditation teacher) has this equation that I've found helpful. Pain (both physical and emotional, if you reduce your resistance to your pain, it will decrease how much you're bothered by it. I know, being sad/depressed and not being as bothered by it as you're now probably seems foreign and ludicrous, but right now, I'm feeling quite  a lot of sadness/depression at my solar plexus for example (sensations that is) and it doesn't bother me that much. Sure, it sucks, even though it's not particulary pleasant. And it doesn't make my do anything I might regret later (for example a suicide attempt). I'm not saying you'll reach this point instantly when you start to meditate



The resources I'd look into is basicmindfulness.org and at Shinzen's youtube channels (just put in Shinzen Young in youtube and you'll find them). His teachings are technical but it's worth getting through.



Check out /r/meditation and here's a video series where you can check out how Shinzen Young works with intense emotions:

It's the only thing I had courage to do. You see, I had no clue anything was wrong with me.  I was a creative bright kid and I thought the sky was the limit for me.  And, then, everything snowballed starting at the end of freshman year. 

It wasn't until my senior year of college (after a term-off from school) that I realized I had a mental illness (with the help of some professionals). but, after one successful period, I thought I was cured.

The next term, and everything snowballed again. I was forced to go on medical leave for over a year in order to figure out my problems. 

Over that time, worked tirelessly with my therapist and psychiatrist. I lose weight, got a summer job, and was going to start my last year and a half of school in the fall of 2010. Life was on the up.  At the time, I was taking trileptal.  It seemed to be doing the trick.

Of course, similar signs started to show. I started to forget to take my medication, and here's what came next: Anxiety. Missed classes. Prolonged procrastination that ended up with me never doing major assignments.  I somehow scraped by in 3/4 classes...but, my academic probation forced me to have to get a C in all of my classes in order to stay at the University. 

Near the end of the term, then, I would go park somewhere. And, just sit. I wouldn't know what to do or where to go. It was a nightmare. And, then, after much consideration, in the middle of a peaceful winter night, A LOT) into a tupperware bowl

I started to feel really funny 1/4 of the way through, I wrote a bunch of cliched suicide notes on my computer. I didn't really know what to say in them, so, I wrote what I could. And, that was that.

In the following morning

I guess my body really tried to stay alive.

And, after failing and being millimeters away from being kicked out of school (I received the letter and everything). And, guess what guys?

I graduated. After over 6 years of struggling, I averaged a 3.8 GPA. It was an unbelievable fight, but, life is really different now. 

So, even when there isn't.  I'm living proof. 

But, and need a doctor who is willing to help you find the right medication. But, if that's not immediately possible, find support--whether it's in your community, in your family, or with your friends. That's why I succeeded. 

TL; DR  I attempted suicide a year ago because I failed out of school.  I fought to stay in school and graduated this past month. Anything is possible.

To begin, my shrink decided to play with my dosage and fool around with all sorts of meds.  By the time I turned 18, I had essentially run the gamut on SSRIs.  Wellbutrin made me anxious, prozac made me feel like a cow, zoloft made it so I couldn't take a piss, and each drug dulled my sexual arousal to nothing.  

Needless to say, I was a wreck) and I was essentially by myself.  And I can't lie, I thought about ending it.  Alcohol became a great way to soothe the pain.  My drug use went up as well.

Despite all the pain, but given the circumstances I was pretty pleased.  Soon after I went to work.  

Flash forward three years and I found myself cycling through the same bouts of depression and mania.  Some months I was up

This same type of cycling continued up until a few months ago.  I was fed up at this point and looking to make a change in my life.  I decide to see a highly recommended psychiatrist in my area.  I'm hesitant, not important just thought I'd mention it).  Low and behold, this new guy is awesome.

Day to day I swim through a pool of idiots. I struggle not to drown in all of the stupidity. This pool is state prison. I miss having conversations that aren't about ""fu**ing the police"" or ""true gangstas"" or ""robbin erribody"". I was raised by two smart, and now I've been thrown into a population of people who think ""education is for fags"". In here I feel smart which I think is sort of funny. In school I struggled with math, but here I'm considered a human calculator. 

I should have joined the military like my family wanted me to do. I was so close to joining the marine corps...but like an idiot I chose to stay home for a girl

I haven't slept in three days. I've been exercising constantly and chugging coffee like I'm dying of thirst. Sometime soon I'm going to pass the f**k out. I wouldn't want someone so unstable to be handling an automatic weapon

I'm sure the thought of ""where did I go wrong"" has crossed my parents' minds. That leaves me feeling like a complete waste of skin. My parents didn't go wrong. I was destined to do something extreme and impulsive. I've always done things literally the hardest way possible. I was just a raging storm of bipolar and always have been. When my brother and I were younger

I'm as bipolar as the sun is hot. My hand is literally shaking like I have a tremor. Sometimes I scare myself. I can't slow down at all. The world seems to be moving so slowly compared to me.

I can't operate within the normal emotional and physical spectrum. I exceed the norm. I feel like shit. But at the same time I have a mixture of a live wire and rocket fuel propelling itself through my veins. I'm struggling right now. Thoughts flood my head. Thoughts that are totally irrelevant and random. They make no sense and I can't stop thinking. I'm sick of them harassing me. I need to be medicated properly. And I need sleep. I'm fighting a nuclear war in my head and I'm losing.

I'm fighting. With everyone. Coworkers, even my boyfriend. Who is/has put up with way more crap than anyone should or have to. I had a meltdown last night because he made a remark about the laundry. Yelled at him to leave the apartment because I wanted to be nowhere near him and I wasn't capable of leaving.

My work has been so slow the last month that even though I am a full time employee, because that way I can get unemployment and use what little of a paycheck I'm getting to carry me until I find a new job.

But the boyfriend's birthday is in two weeks and I won't be able to afford a gift or even a drink at the bar for him. And he spoiled me on my birthday. Made me feel like a princess and got me all this awesome stuff and I know it shouldn't be about stuff or money

Hi there again, anything, and I broke up with my boyfriend and moved back in with my mom because of it. A couple nights after that I was thinking way too much and managed to get myself 20 minutes of sleep before I had to go to work. I woke up feeling fucking fantastic. Like I could take on the world, ya know? 


Well, said that I'd be back in 5, bit my tongue, and walked outside to my car. As soon as I got there I started crying and hyperventilating. I've only felt like that a few in my life, and it was *terrifying*. I managed to gain my composure back within a few minutes (thankfully, my panic attacks get out of hand real fast) and used one of my good old trusty coping mechanisms to somewhat detach myself from my thoughts and autopilot my way through the morning. Sure, the alarms still made me want to start punching people, but it was so surreal that I didn't act on any of my impulses.


Now, and any night that I do get 6+ hours of sleep I can barely drag my ass out of bed. I'm still depressed when I don't sleep, but I'm every other kind of feels on top of it, too. The suicidal ideation is so intense. So vivid. Yet I've resisted all the urges to self-harm. I have Klonopin for sleep and I've even only taking the recommended dose for that. Without it I probably wouldn't be getting more than an hour of sleep. There's also the racing thoughts and fantastic ideas, but I have no willpower to start planning past ""Best idea ever!"". Ugh. Visual/Auditory hallucinations that I just don't give a shit about, too. I feel like a blender.


I've been like this for about 2.5 weeks now, and an even more confusing story as to how I managed to get a therapy session for tomorrow. Maybe she'll at least be able to talk to my psychiatrist for me. Only 100mg of Lamictal isn't doing shit for me.

------

And now on with our continuing saga....


I think that the final delusion may be starting to crumble.

The other day we were talking about everything

She was talking about what I believe was her initial delusion - 'the guy' was at a hospital where we were visiting a friend of hers

My answer was that it didn't matter if he was there or not (she knows I don't think he was there

But, after that, she's been starting to say that she is feeling sad that she isn't feeling a connection between us.  

Again, she was telling me she had not emotions about us, and that she felt emotionally numb.  The fact that she is feeling sad is an improvement!  And I've seen her smiling and lauging at the girls, so I know she is also feeling some happiness.  

Yesterday, feeling emotion is a *good* thing! Frankly I would prefer her being mad / pissed off at me than feeling 'nothing'.  And yes, I know that my feelings there are normal.  *grin*

There have been a few more baby steps in the past couple of days.

1) When we're watching a show on TV

2) She pulled me close to cuddle in bed.  Not asking

3) Last night she was looking over old photos of us (YAY!) and when I got home later in the evening, and wondered what happened to us.  The great news for me with this one is that now she is acknowledging that we DID have something.  Prior to this, she wasn't sure if we ever did or not! 


Now that the final delusion is falling

I think the odds of short term success for our marriage may have just nudged above 50%.

At some point I want to have a talk with her that she's not going to like....  She's said a few times that she wishes she knew whether 'the guy' was married or gay because it would make her decision easier.  I'm going to talk to her about how if she wants to stay

I'm trying to figure out the best time to talk to her about this is.   She seems to be starting to emotionally recover now

We are also seeing a therapist together for our marriage.  This person is trying to use Emotional Focused Therapy (http://www.amazon.ca/Hold-Me-Tight-Conversations-Lifetime/dp/031611300X) to try to rebuild the emotional attachments between us.  I know its helping me realize how I've contributed towards her feelings about the the relationship.  Even if my wife isn't in a state yet for it to help

I hope you all have a great Christmas season!  As a side note

I know that its going to be tough remaining in this relationship

I was diagnosed bipolar a few years ago and have had my fair share of mood swings. We all know the drill. It's not pretty. I've been depressed for a long time. I recently decided that I need to find my happy, but beneficial.

Today, and I found myself thankful for a lot of things, not the least of which was the subtle reminder that no matter how shitty I feel there's a world of good, positive, things that I'm lucky to have and I'm simply not paying attention to: I slept in my contacts two nights ago and tried to take them out in yesterday morning. I scratched my eyeball doing this and spent the day in an immense amount of pain - my eye was hurting, it was sensitive to light, and it was weeping. This morning I woke up and it was no better. I was worried I'd done serious damage to it. I called a doctor's office and they gave me a same day appointment. It's easy to take something like this for granted, doctors that are willing to see me even though they probably want to get home to their families. I have health insurance

This may seem a little bit cheesy, and couldn't really afford to see a doctor, the fact that I live in a place where there ARE doctors is amazing. I spent two years living in East Africa, and it's easy to forget how much better off I am than most people on this planet.

* 2 - Tells me that she does not have the time to compose a letter for a university I will be attending in the fall. I am trying to receive some accommodations at my future university
* 3 - Does not explain to me what certain terms mean. According to my intake notes I am now Mood Disorder N.O.S.

Some things that the supervisor said:

* 1 - Regarding my questions about certain medications interacting with my psyche medications
* 2 - I should not ask questions because my appointments with my pdoc are for maintenance purposes
* 3 - It is assumed that ""self-described"" means that I was previously diagnosed. I was not told this previously from my pdoc. I responded that an explanation from the pdoc would have been sufficient for me to understand this term. Which leads to...
* 4 - Supervisor telling me that the clinic does not have time to explain things to me.
* 5 - Doctor's don't answer questions about the medication
* 6 - That I should be thankful for my pdoc to sign a form required for me to receive benefits (which I am
* 7 - Why did I leave my previous doctor if I say that my previous doctor was very informational when it comes to my concerns. (I replied with
* 8 - And finally


I'm not quite sure how I should feel about this situation. I do feel that I don't want to go back there anymore. Was I overreacting? Is it wrong for me to be concerned about my own health?

I'm bipolar II with ADD, and substance-abuse issues. 

I've been hospitalized more than 10 times for depression, etc. 

Regardless

I do that with the help of Wellbutrin XL, Vyvanse and YAZ. (I take Concerta daily; I switch every few days between Adderall and Vyvanse are because they're relatively new to my regime, and I'm uncertain if I like them. Adderall flattens me out a bit but Vyvanse makes me anxious.)

I'm aware I probably won't have children; I've been pregnant before and chose to terminate it. I suffered extreme postpartum depression, and put my then-husband through hell. (Postpartum depression can happen even if you choose to terminate the pregnancy.)

I'm wary about being in a committed relationship again. Relationships make me anxious; they usually trigger major depressive episodes. I've had serious suicide attempts in most of my major relationships. The pain these events cause my loved ones is too much to bear. 
 
I rarely disclose my mental illness to people I work with or to my university. I disclose my illness to friends, and the like. It's rare for me, though, to request accommodations such as deadline extensions. 

I'm annoyed when I hear people use mental illness as a reason for why they cannot manage their lives or why they treat loved ones badly. I've treated loved ones badly as a result of my illness, yes--who caused harm and hurt.

I had been on and off again with this person for 8 years now and while I am not happy that she found someone new before our relationship ever ended I do find myself looking forward to new relationships. Hopefully with someone who likes me for me: kooky and bi-polar.

Also when I was much younger I found it much easier to cope with physical pain as opposed to emotional pain. It was almost like I felt TOO MUCH

Also during manic phases I have thought I was incredibly attracted to people but then they do ONE THING that I don't agree with and I flip like a light switch.

Well

See where it's gotten him.

He is currently incarcerated in our state prison. Inside

All this time, they believed him and gave him a generic anti-depressant and a low dose of a mood stabilizer. Not the meds he'd been on in the past, but at least they were something. Then he was experiencing bad side effects so he reported them to the psychiatrist making her rounds on his tier that day. This was her response:

""So maybe you're not Bipolar!""

You can imagine my shock when my son told me a medical professional said this to him. Isn't it her job to diagnose and treat mental illnesses? Yet she can speak to a patient like this?

But the worst part was what she did next.

She took him off the anti-depressant completely. She told him that in order to receive any more treatment

So for the last several months I've been trying to acquire all of his records to prove that he IS, I called his regular doctor who was unable to call the doctor at the prison- this is because the diagnosis did not come from his regular doctor, it came from a psychiatric hospital. Makes sense.

So then I went the route of requesting his medical records. Sounds easy enough. But consider the fact that he's 21 years old. This means every single medical professional he saw in his lifetime required a separate release form signed by my son. So, sending them to him to be signed, having him send them back to me, and then sending them to the correct establishments in hopes of receiving the records. This was a nightmare. Thankfully, the nurse at his regular doctor's office helped me with this and eased the stress considerably.

We were almost home free when we realized that the release forms we'd been using were not accepted at certain mental health facilities. 

Back to the drawing board.

Thankfully

After FIVE MONTHS

So Maybe he IS Bipolar like he's been saying all along.

Seeing a room that's warm and glowing with a fireplace reflecting light on well fed happy faces, while I stand in the snow muted darkness. 

I still don't understand people, what they mean. I feel both torn and empty, part of me dies to connect, it feels like starvation, yet I don't know how to bridge the gap, I can't pass through glass walls.

I am afraid to even to try to find a door, the turned backs, the dropped hints that I am doing wrong, that I should have the common sense to behave the right way. Asking if anything's wrong. No of course not. Fake white smile. Wondering how their teeth are so white, pressing my lips down over yellowed teeth, wondering what else looks wrong to them, at the same time hating the superficiality of it all, hating reflections.

Hating my face as it reflects back in the mirror, falling short, yet pressed to do more. I deformed my body with food and hid in sleep and dreams of a better place and caring people, as the years clicked by, and woke up realizing I had missed all the places I should have visited along the way. The sharing points of life. The parties of youth, first loves, adventure, concerts, all things that lend a common nostalgia that I can't even share. Feeling the tension build

1369968677.0,1fdq96,I'm just not sure what I should do anymore.,masterofwolves,12,0,18,"**I've posted here before a few times about feeling alone

In high school I had several friends. I wasn't really popular but there were a lot of people that I knew

I had one friend, right before I went off to college in Pittsburgh. Side note; I live in Ohio.

I met a great group of friends at college and we were thicker than thieves. We called ourselves the wolf pack, no matter where life would take us. Well, after freshman year my finances fell through and I was unable to attend college.

When I came back from college I didn't see any of the friends that I had from high school, and (in what could arguably be a manic and unwise episode) moved in with her at her home in Pittsburgh. During this time I remained in contact with my friends from college and even visited them one or two times, and tried to keep in contact with Joe but wasn't successful.

Some shit feel through and I had to move back to my home in Ohio. My girlfriend and I, since I do not have a car (due to bipolar issues and financial issues). I have been home for five months and haven't really seen anyone yet. I have hung out with Joe one or two times in the entire five months that I have been home, just three or five times in the last year. That's about it.

I'm not sure what to do anymore. I'm getting really lonely sitting at home in a small town with my parents. I'm working a job at a local pizza shop, say that they or busy, or just straight up lie to me so they don't have to hang out with me. I have literally caught people lying to me. I'm not really sure how to make new friends and there aren't any people my age (20) left in this town.

I'm really hopeless. I'm so alone that I'm having suicidal thoughts

I don't know what to do. Do I post a status on Facebook calling people out on their shit and telling them how alone and miserable I have felt and been for the last five months? Do I just give up and accept the fact that I am going to be living alone with my parents for the next two years?

I just feel like these people whom I really care about and want to hang out with, take advantage of me for my skills and equipment and stuff but never want to actually do anything with me.
I sit alone while they are out having fun, nor have the skills to do.

I just feel like I am a fucking stupid loser, but I never get anything back for anything that I do, I feel like I am not appreciated for anything, like I am just used like a machine or something.

1356271578.0,15br0d,Your Bipolar Story/ My Bipolar Story- [Long Thread],Ahhcrapp,14,2,5,"I thought it would be beneficial to read other people's experiences with Diagnosis/hospitalization/medication.  This illness is often kept under the carpet

I will begin

My story-

As a child I had quite a normal middle-class upbringing with the exception of being violated (I have to keep the details it to myself here).  I was not accepted well in school.  I kept a lot to myself.  My feelings/emotions were always very high.  For example, having feelings that show can be seen as a weakness, so I got pretty good at keeping my feelings to myself.  

Keeping feelings and things to myself proved to be beneficial.  In college

Fast forward 7 years-  I had a house, four kids, and a lot of responsibility.  Things were going well at work, but the responsibilities were very high.  With four kids and a wife at home, it made for more stress with work/time/money.  That is when the breakthrough came in the form of panic attacks.  I had panic attacks (PAs) as a child, but only in claustrophobic situations.  These PAs would come on at the most inopportune times ie. during a presentation/performance review.  It got to the point that I had PAs daily.  One PA lasted over an hour.  I of course kept it all locked inside me until it started to affect my work and life to the point of not being able to function.  For 2 months I went from my main doctor to a psychiatrist to therapy.  I was given Xanax and Paxil.  Over the course of 4 years, I learned to deal with things.  With medication

As a child, I found myself lured to the web for ""relief"" for lack of a better word.  The main problem in our bedroom has been my very high sex drive and her low sex drive (nothing new there).  

So there I am, I know that it would hurt my wife, but I do it anyway.  Chat turns to email, email to text, text to calling, calling to sexting.  One night my little internet friend sexts me while I am fast asleep.  My wife sees the message and, long story short our relationship is in tatters.  

Fast forward 3 weeks, the fog is lifting and the sun is coming up on the horizon.  Up ahead, there is a concrete cattle chute for loading cattle onto trucks.  I had a teacher that died from hitting one of those when his accelerator stuck.  I don't want to face people at work.  I don't want to face my wife at home.  A thought enters my brain-  Death would be better.

It's Friday, and xanax.  I mix them all.  The kids are in bed, we are arguing.  I say goodbye and that I'm sorry.  I never deserved you in the first place.  I am sorry, goodbye.

I'm in the hospital

1354113631.0,13xni2,My personal experience for mental healthcare in the UK,ninjacat57,12,0,15,"Hi

Im bipolar. I was diagnosed ten years ago with it but slipped through the cracks and was left to fend for myself. Over the past ten years Ive destroyed countless friendships and relationships and myself.

Starting at the beginning of this year the condition worsened to the point where i quite literally couldnt function and decided that it was time to get some real help. This is my experience.

I first completed a questionnaire the doctor gave me and was referred to a mental health care unit with Community Psychiatric Nurses and counselors. After meeting with a CPN i was told i needed to see a pdoc.  So my care was split into two places. PLACE 1 is the CPN action team with psychologists and counselors. PLACE 2 is the pdoc

PLACE 1 Told me i desperately needed to speak to a pyscholgist and would get me seen asap which should be within two months. That was in February. I am still waiting and have had no further contact off them.

PLACE 2 
Started seeing my pdoc who quickly re-diagnosed me with bipolar but refuses to tell me which type. The only notes he takes are on ripped up bits of paper on his desk and asked the EXACT same questions each time i see him. I am the one who has to tell him which medication i am on and what dosage as he doesnt know. 

So far in last ten years ive been given up to 14 different types of anti depressents to try. They send me completely loopy each time. Went toxic on 800 mg of lithium (my last visit to pdoc he tried prescribing me that again and i had to tell him i had already tried it and the outcome and his reaction was 'oh well

The 'episode' im referring to is where i had completely lost control of my emotions for 48 hours and cried non stop, i was told off for swearing down the phone. Apparently i said the word 'bloody' but have no recollection of doing so and then was told i was being silly and should take the tranqs the pdoc gave me. Oh i forgot to mention the diazepam and lorezpam i was given have absolutely no effect on me. 

So now I'm unmedicated been told by my pdoc that he has come to the end of types of medication he can try me on! but now only wants to see me every 4 months instead of fortnightly!

Yep unmedicated and doesnt want to see me because he cant fix me! Im going crazy

Seriously can someone suggest something? Anything i could try?  Please dont say i should smoke weed. I get that suggestion a lot. I have tried it briefly and it just makes me even more paranoid than normal. Im desperate for some help. Im sick of having a brain that wont shut up, making my son frightened because he doesnt know which person im going to be on a day to day basis and basically im just tired of life. 

Theres got to be something out there than can help.
