The single mod of /r/FIFA13 isn't interested. He has, /r/FIFA15, etc are going to be as inclined to play nice either. 

I'd like to see the mods of /r/FIFA get on this

But a lot of people see the good that it would bring a community to have a one stop place for all things FIFA the game. Others who don't mind migrating won't take long to convince that everything will be okay once they see how awesome it can work to grow as a community and stay solid together.

In previous discussions

As you can see

So

**Is there an interest in creating a very specific subreddit for all of the EA Sports FIFA series similar to /r/EA_NHL? One that will be active and implement even a few things that help bridge a community together? For OTP, Tips, Tricks, News, Videos, FIFA13, FIFA14

If so

If we want to make that place /r/FIFA

*So

1365386994.0,1bw3d3,Game Tip: How Not Beat Yourself With Goal Kicks,crocajun1003,42,6,19,"Posted this over on /r/EA_FIFA
_____
After playing for a long time in Div 1

* 1. Clinical finishing
* 2. Not Beating Yourself

One of the big ways players tend to beat themselves is on Goal Kicks. In this tip
________________
The goal kick may be the closest thing to a positioning ""glitch"" in Fifa 13 as it puts the team taking the kick at such a disadvantage. So much can go wrong. If the kicker attempts to pass to one of the CBs or FBs at the edge of the box, stronger CBs. This can lead to a quick counter with a powerful header from a CB to a forward leaving the team that took the kick's defense out of position and chasing. These against the run-of-play scoring chances can change the game and should always be avoided. 

So what do you do on a goal kick to maintain possession and avoid easy giveaways? Here's what most of the top Div. 1 players I've seen do. 

Chip it to the full back. That's it. Don't boot it. NEVER pass it along the ground. Chip it to the full back. If your taking the goal kick from the right side

This method has proven to be the best way to maintain possession off a goal kick without the potential of giving up scoring chances. The chipped pass is much tougher for the defending team to cleanly intercept and create a shot

If your opponent decides to defend the fullback, put 3 bars power and just kick it out of bounds. 

On the other hand

Fifa 13 can be a tough game with often small details determining the difference between winning and losing

When EA became aware of this issue, Messi's, etc. being sold and bought for around 5k coins.

Now, as top players will be relatively common and therefore not worth much. In addition, the glitch has given several players an unfair advantage, as they were able to benefit by exploiting it themselves or by being lucky and at the right place to pick up an amazing deal. On the other hand, others claim it is unfair to those who have acquired players by legal means to lose them again. 

Since there was also a substantial amount of coins generated through this mechanism, however, also possible that since a select few users are hugely rich, the absolute top players will be so expensive that they will be unreachable for the rest of the community. Since the ""wealth inequality"" between the top 5% and the rest is currently so large, chances are that they will only compete amongst each other for the absolute best players.

Anyway, the workings of the forum are far more primitive than Reddit, and the same can be said about the average user.

**TLDR edit: Users found an exploit, which would mean that everyone loses their progress so far, including the players from their starter packs.**

I've gotten bored of FIFA 13 really quickly due to seasons, I started with ~ 1.05 million coins, and now I have around 2.5k. 

The best player I got (value-wise) was Pirlo or UP Turan.

That's ridiculous. I'm not angry and I'm not ""fed up"" because I wasn't going to do anything with the coins anyways, that's not good enough.

I know that the ""economy"" of FIFA is supposed to be expensive

I'm a decent trader and at my peak of my coins I had around 2.5 million

(P.S: I tried to make this not sound bitchy although I'm guessing it does.

Right. Let's say your player is a centre back - [Chiellini
He has four links:  

* To the LB  
* To the GK  
* To the CDM  
* To the other CB  
   
If you want him to get 9 chemistry
Here's how to get points from the players he's linked to:  
  
* For 1 point - someone from the same league  
* For 1.5 points - someone from the same team  
* For 1.5 points - someone from the same nation

This replay I saved of an UT game I was playing earlier perfectly shows what I'm talking about: http://www.ea.com/uk/football/videos/ugc/155118001

I have the ball at the top of the 18 with a striker up near the penalty spot, as I have noticed the computer misinterpreting passes more often in the higher difficulty modes as a way to artificially make the game more difficult), and instead end up passing the ball to my striker who proceeds to take an off-balance shot that gets blocked by a defender. 

This is the point where I proceed to want to throw my Xbox out the window. My winger who has just made a great run into the box, which they eventually do. The video cuts off before you see the other defender waltz in basically uncontested and clear it, but you can clearly watch my winger stare at the deflected shot, and even though he is about the same distance away from the the free ball as both the keeper and other defender (if not closer), he mindlessly trots AWAY from the ball, all the while I'm frantically trying to switch players to him to manually force him to go to it, but really had no chance from the beginning because the computer has already forced his movement away from the ball and effectively removed him from the play.

This situation happens to me MUCH too frequently. Anytime there is a free ball up for grabs, but instead the 'locking in' system is used instead. Additionally, the lock in system appears to be (in my opinion) favored to select defenders over forwards to lock into free balls in an attempt for the game to make it more difficult for people to score. I don't know if this is just FIFA's attempt to provide more balance to attacking vs. defending, but watching players who are close to the ball and have a great chance of winning possession just quit and make no attempt whatsoever to contest possession is absolutely infuriating.

**TL;DR - FIFA should program all players nearest to free balls to GO TO THE BALL instead of defaulting to the typical 'lock in' system the game uses,,False,,t5_2qxh7,False,,True

_________________________________________________________

This play is so simple and so effective I'm not sure why everyone doesn't do it. Here's how it goes: 

When you're defending a corner kick, and the player **further up field** is usually an attacker. 

Select the player further up and send him up field along the sideline as high as you can. Ideally

When the corner kick is taken, cross, chip through ball) to the player you've sent up field. 

The up field attacker should receive the ball with no defenders around him

I've scored more goals off of this simple maneuver than I can count.

1375095519.0,1j9pvb,Which stats are taken into consideration for card stats?,Pimp-My-Alpaca,18,6,12,"So, Vidal

**Pace -** 

This should be the easy one. Just (sprint speed + acceleration)/2. However it is not so.

      |Reus | Messi | Vidal | Chiellini
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
Card Face (CF) Pace | 90 | 93 | 80 | **80**
Sprint Speed | 88 | 92 | 80 | 76
Acceleration | 92 | 95 | 80 | 82
Supposed Pace | 90 | 93.5 | 80 | **78**



So, which was 1 off too. So I decided that I should look at a different stat.

**Dribbling -**

This was harder, Zlatan has 37 balance but 87 dribbling)

      |Reus | Messi | Vidal | Chiellini
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
CF Dribbling| 84 | 96 |**82** | **53**
Dribbling| 86 | 97 | 82 | 52
Ball Control| 79 | 96 | 84 | 54
Agility | 89 | 94 | 76 | 60
Supposed Pace | 84.333 | 95.666 | **80.666** | **55.333**

So this time it was half of the players wrong. And i can't think of another stat that could balance this. For example, finishing, free kicks, positioning and vision. None of these would make sense to count in to dribbling.

I really couldn't be be bothered to check other CF ratings

As of this I have come up with three possible answers

1. There are numbers that multiply each stat relevant to that topic. E.g. Dribbling is more important than agility when it comes to the CF dribbling

1. Each CF rating is different for a position - makes next to no sense

1. EA can't do basic maths - unlikely as surely they'd have an algorithm for this

I understand that if the game recognized you are winning, disconnect, and count a win for a fraction of the effort.

At the very least instead of having utilizing a method that completely screws the player, DNF% and getting penalized for something that's not the user's fault.  Not to mention conserving our contracts that go to waste on these occurrences.

I'm a serious player(emphasis on player, playmaker. I'll let my play speak for itself.

Philosophy is key. I'm so fucking frustrated with pro-rank matches, and counter-attack to infinity like juveniles. That's for pro-ranked, rookies. My philosophy is UNSELFISHNESS. Joga Bonito. Work the ball in the box. Keep possession, pass and move, with fluid movement. Open lanes and beat offside trap with 1-2 passing. Tiki-taka when opponents try extremely high pressure traps. Smart, high pressure defense including mids to recycle possession and unleash deadly counters if appropriate. Maintaining at least 60% possession will lead the way with creative players who can open up chances, and smart defensive tactics.

I need players who:

* Don't x-spam 
* Pass 
* Know when and how to create chances.
* Play their position
* Active  
* Mature (*Prerequisite*; Puberty)
* Did I mention don't x -spam


This is a brand new club as of today. So patience is key. It''ll take work and time.

1348664230.0,10i5kn,FUTonomics- The CAM,theshadykoala,14,1,22,"Source website for statistics- http://www.futwiz.com/

The CAM is an integral position in any FUT team. It provides the striker(s) a player to play off and gets someone in between the opposition's midfield and defence. It is my experience that a CAM is VITAL for someone who like to play a quick passing style.

The question is what makes a good CAM?

In my opinion the stats that need to be focused on when using a CAM are:
Agility and acceleration to glide past defenders and open space
Long shots- the CAM will often find the opportunity for a long shot as the defenders try to track the run of the strikers 
Ball control- a good CAM needs to be able to keep the ball close and get the ball under control quickly
Vision- for those OP chip through balls
4+ star skills help but are not necessary
Traits: long shot taker

The best CAMs will have a rating of 75+ in all these catagories. A quick search reveals what you would expect. Players like silva

But who are the most undervalued CAMs in FUT.

1. Renato Augusto- 1200
2. Matias fernandez- 1500
3. Samedov- 600
4. D'alessandro- 1200
5. Thiago Neves- 900
6. Emanuelson- 800
7.Vieirinha- 800

These players meet the requirements to make a great CAM while being very affordable. Give them a go and you will not be dissapointed

________________________________________________________


PKs can be excruciating. At times it will seem like you never guess the right direction. PKs can frustrate players to point of completely losing their mental edge. And shootouts? Losing a shootout can put anyone on suicide watch. So what's the secret? The secret is to take your head out the game and trust the odds. 


**PKs**

Pick a side right now. Left or right. Chose one. From now on this is your side. Every time you get a PK, oh well, the odds will come back to you eventually. 
This simple tip has allowed me to be a much more level headed player and not think myself out of matches. When my opponent blocks it

**Shootouts**

Shootouts are a bit different because an intelligent opponent can eventually catch on to your game. I haven't lost a shootout since I don't know when. Here's the shootout secret. 


On your first PK, on the next four, resume going in your chosen PK direction. 


For goalie, resume diving in the same direction.

P.s if you are one of those Brazilian Gold Squad pace whores in the lower division purposely doing this

Context : Faced 5 full gold squads in Div 4. All pace whores. Against my shitty bronze squad. LWLLL

Now I am in danger of being relegated. 

Edit 1 : 

**My likes about the new system :** 

I do like the system of having divisions, and when you win divisions you get coins aswell. Superb, way better than last year, where you just played with no real ""league"" or ""win/loss"" objective in mind. 

The design is nice

**My dislikes about the new system :**

Can't see the rating of my opponents teams.

Pace whoring is still a pain in the ass for us financially poor players.

In lower divisions like Div 5 and 4. There are full gold squads. It's like a scenario where Barcelona have been put into the Npower league. 

**What I wanted to see in the new system :**

Less pace whoring.

Kits numbers could be changed.

Customised formations.


I haven't tried anything else besides ""Online season"".

1.)Draft system; 


I plan on entering everyone's name in this website (http://www.random.org/lists/) 
-This helps randomize a list of names I enter. The randomizing will be Frap'd if requested and posted on youtube
-The draft will take place 1-2 days After game release.&gt;&gt;&gt; (Negotiable)&lt;&lt;&lt; 
-The results of the list will show the order of draft picks each round. This will work like the NFL. For example
-Once the draft order is decided, the draft will be done by the order in which the list chose. For example, if Scott is the #1 pick he will be the first to comment with the name of the player he will be drafting, then so on etc. etc. until the first round of drafting is completed. 
-Once you drafted a player, and there's simply an except or decline reply. 


ex. I want Joe's #1 draft spot in the second round. I drafted Rooney first round. I make a comment in the ""1st Round Trades"" post like this 


Brian- @Joe My Rooney for your 2nd round draft pick? 
Joe- Yes 


He now owns the rights to Rooney


2.) Who are the Draft-able players; 


This won't be too hard to explain
-Draft-able players will only be holographic gold players. NOT LIMITED to this image&gt;&gt;&gt; 


ex. (http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-g-i_CSpRRyM/T7wmlF97laI/AAAAAAAACiI/uhM5Au23oWo/s1600/MOTM+Orange++Players.png) 


-All player regular gold or below will be free for all to use. 


ex. (http://i.ytimg.com/vi/yc5-3NcvB-g/0.jpg) 



3.) Rights to players; 


Whomever you choose to draft
-whether you choose to play the player you drafted or not
-You can have multiple drafting strategies; Do you want to draft to counter your biggest threat or draft to make the best team you can? The decision is yours. 



4.) Schedule 


Our season will run with the same fundamentals as the champions league but instead of a qualifying round


(http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2013/competitionformat/index.html) 


-Depending on the number of participants
-Before assigning people to groups


ex. Group A.- Consists of Player B, Player L 


-To randomize different groupings, Player B, Player C, Player D.....etc. 
-After assigned your letter



5.) Game results 


After a game is played, your team letter and opponents. You will attach a screenshot of the match facts with score. The text of the mail will have the score and red/yellow card summary. 


ex. Subject: 10/1 Group A: TEAM A vs TEAM F 


4-1 Team A. 


Messi- Yellow 
Pepe- Yellow 


-It's your responsibility to produce the games based off the calendar on time. (which will be made and shared to keep the season on track.) 



6.) Yellow/Red Cards- 


Yellow/Red card tracking will be tracked based off the honor system. 
-It's your responsibility to keep track of who will have to sit out in-games. It's too much information for my admin and I to keep track of. However


7.) Forfeit system 



As a result of a forfeit
- Take your score from your most recent win and apply it to the game your opponent forfeited. If you do not have a score from your most recent win
- The player who forfeited the match receives a score of 0 on the forfeited match. 


Ex. in game #1


This system was developed so players are not punished for their opponents forfeiting. On the contrary


FAQ 


-Q: When does this season start? 

A: 1 week after release date. 


-Q: I wont have enough coins to buy my drafted players by the time the first game comes

A: Mostly everyone will be in the same boat. That's why all regular gold players and lower are free to anyone. To forecast

-Q:How long do we have to play our scheduled games? 

A: 2-days to decide on a time on the calendar and play against your opponent. 2 day period is implemented so the group stages can proceed on time. A calendar will be made


-Q: If 2 days pass and my opponent never played me what happens? 

A: You refer to the forfeit system. 


-Q: What will we be playing for? 

A: Coins. The first season buy-in will be 5


-Q: Who gets the winnings? 

A: First place receives 70% of the winnings; Second place receives 30%. 


-Q: What about injuries? 

A: Injuries are too frequent in Fifa


-Q: Will the good people be handicapped? 

A: No there is no handicap system 


-Q: The way the drafting system is

A: It works both ways. You can sacrifice the top rated players for a mediocre team with players nobody cares for. Everyone will be making sacrifices and will have teams that will sometimes be a little random

**B. Games Played**

(*if you sub someone on

Also, but doesn't get a goal or assist in either, still include him as such:
Radamel Falcao, A 0

*  Only the five major leagues (Barclays PL, Italian Serie A and Spanish Liga BBV; just to keep the data more compact.

Of course this is entirely for fun, although I'd be impressed).

I would like to enrich the dataset before I do anything with it, i'm always okay with giving it out of course haha, just ask

One thing to note! If you play as an International team, separate from, Barcelona - Messi. :)

One being Tim Krul. He's a 79 overall, is an 81 overall rare. To me it doesn't make sense. Krul started the last World Cup qualifier for the the Dutch, and is the starter for a much bigger club. Does that always matter? No. But most of the time, bigger club means better keeper. Not only that, but Krul started over Stekelenburg (82 overall, rare) not Vorm. Meaning Vorm is the 3rd keeper for the Dutch, yet Krul is the lowest rated. 

Staying at keeper, and madly expensive at the moment. His he better than Cech, Hart, Krul, De Gea, or others? Well he could be, but we haven't seen much of him yet in a spurs shirt. He didn't even start today against QPR.

My idea for Fifa 14 or 15 is centred around Career- Manager mode

**The idea:** Introduce a leveling up model in Manager mode that incentivises players to start their career mode with poor quality teams and build up their profile and career. 

**How would it work:**

* Players start as an unknown manager.  They can choose to start at a small club or a Barcelona or an Arsenal.

* As managers successfully meet their objectives and improve their teams

* The factors determining the 'Skills' awarded will include the quality of the team
Quality of club: performing fantastically with a lower tiered club
Style: Or playing a possession strategy successfully may give you Skill bonuses relating to passing and vision of players.
Achievements: the bigger the achievements the faster you acquire Skills.
Management: the more successful you are in managing the transfers

* Some Skills earned may be tied to a particular club

* Skills may also be lost based on bad performance.

* *IMPORTANT:* the player as the option of carrying on their career or resetting the timeline so that their achievements are not lost.  E.g. If you start by managing Portsmouth for five years (2013-2018), i.e. recorded as being between 2008-2013. This is to avoid the problem of ‘ageing’ of players and losing the opportunity of playing with the current best players because you started with a lower team.

* Every other club has managers like you

**Skills:**
So the Skills awarded to managers could come from a wide range of areas:

* Attacking
* Morale – e.g. Never Say Die Skill
* Transfer market skills – e.g. A negotiator Skill may give you the upper hand in buying players for cheap
* Management skills – e.g. Fostering Skill would enable a manager to get more rapid growth from his youth players.

The possibilities available are too many for me to list

**One Additional Feature**

I would also make a change to the growth system FIFA uses for its youth players.  At the moment,,False,,t5_2qxh7,1360579666.0,,True

1349251786.0,10v6nk,Some FIFA problems I've noticed - from a FUT Online Player. ,mxray,8,2,11,"I'm a long time FIFA player, I won D1 H2H several times). 

First I will highlight the 2 that are the most frustrating to me. 

**--- First ---**

There are 2 types of players that I face online.

1. Players with similar level teams
2. Players with clearly worse teams

When I play group 1 teams, and the better player wins. I consider myself a good fifa player and I end up winning a majority of these games, with the occasional 1-2 point loss. 

When I play group 2 teams, I need to play absolutely flawless. A majority of the games however I feel like the opponents team is boosted in some way. All of the bounces go to their team, the tackles come easy, and if they have a pacey team they destroy me. I pass the ball and it goes too far/too short to the wrong player, and it gets intercepted.  I have lost at least 15 games by 4+ goals, and zero of them have been against a team at my star level. 

I think that there is some kind of handicap present or something going on that makes a teams crosses, and defending lackluster when playing a much worse team that knows what they're doing. I'm soon going to create a squad with the best 78-82 level players I can find/afford and test this theory. 


**--- Second ---** 

This happens mostly during the happenings of my last paragraph, and you are always being swarmed with defenders. I feel like unless I pass it immediately, my only options are to move away from the goal, or sprint across the pitch with a defender right on my tail, needing to pass. Only about once a game will a player on my team make a run where he is not completely covered by a defender or have a passing lane, and give me a good chance to score.  This really only occurs during the above ""handicapping"" I've noticed, and has ruined the offensive side of the ball for me. 

**--- The Rest ---**

The other things I've noticed in-game or read online that I also have been experiencing are as follows (**please add more in the comments and I will add them**):

* Finesse shots are shit. A finesse shot goal occurs by either team about once ever 5-7 games. I do think that it was overused in fifa12

* Knocking it past the keeper is much much harder to do and often fails when done correctly. More on this in 2 bullets.

* Sometimes when a defender is running towards a player from behind that is clearly slower (I used to have mertesacker - 32 pace - and ive seen it done with him)

* When a fast striker has been given a through ball or has a breakaway of some sort, 45% of the time the keeper with either easily grab it, 45% of the time the defender will magically catch up to you and tackle you, and 10% of the time the it will be effective. Fake shots are impossible as it slows you down too much and the defender will get the ball 90% of the time. 

* There is no momentum in 13. This is something all over the EA forums and I've recently begun to notice it. After scoring a goal, and same in mine after an opponents goal. 

* The last problem I had is one that only I have been having, and I try to head the ball, most of the time the player tries a diving header towards the goal and comes no where close to the ball at all. In previous games they at least attempted to get in front of the defender and it occasionally worked, but for whatever reason I'm having my players whiff completely.

1349222695.0,10uh2x,My crackpot FUT theory,,11,4,14,"Ok stick with me here.  This has been formulated after playing at least 45 plus games online.

I think that the way your team performs is directly linked to the rating (probably chemistry too or whatever) of the team youre playing AGAINST.

I have this 70 rated american team with 95 chemistry that I play with

Then I move up in the divisions, none of my players go on good runs, etc etc.  Like the AI is just bad.  I have my team in offsides trap but they never hold their line (i don't know the proper terminology).  So I've just been getting super frustrated.  Especially because the entire time, my team has been improving rating and chemistry wise (well not exactly rating because I had a bunch of gold players on my bench that I got from opening packs that I just never bothered to move off until Id get an american replacement).  Morale has stayed high, I never let it dip much.  Ive actually kept my players more fresh with subs that I could rotate in and out and using cards and stuff etc.

So then my last game I play a team that's bad on paper, and scored 2 goals with Jozy Altidore on the attack.

So my theory is, and ruins the satisfaction of trying to build a team (which they already ruined by giving me more gold players than I had all of last year just for fucking booting up the game and doing some shit).  

If you build a team you should expect their play to stay consistent and let you win or lose based on your own skill as long as you keep their chem, it feels cheap, and its frustrating.

He has very crappy dribbling and passing and doesn't fit into the possession oriented 4-1-2-1-2 bundesliga squad that I play which requires the strikers to drop back. I should have realized that before I bought him because that's not how he plays in real life.

As for biggest surprises. Kevin Grobkreutz. There is a noticeable lack of Left midfielders in Bundesliga and I got him mostly as a placeholder but he has been great for me. He is a really solid all around player and if I am holding the ball near the top of the box he often comes flying down the right wing and either gets an assist or a nice shot on target that has a high percentage of scoring.",,t5_2qxh7,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/10wikk/who_are_your_biggest_regrets_and_biggest/
