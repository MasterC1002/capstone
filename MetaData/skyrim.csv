You are getting a lot of rep with Skyrim out, rather than have you go down the path of Call of Duty and others in the new game every year mentality. You are one of the few gaming companies that deserves the respect of the players. Lets keep it that way.

Sincerely

1373455898.0,1i023d,The metals of Skyrim: In-game and real life,Faervhan,2988,1096,228,"I found out quite a while ago that most of the metals used to make weapons and armor in Skyrim actually exist in the real world. I was looking at what Ebony actually was

To start off

**Gold**, **Silver**

These metals are the same as they are in real life
___
**Dwarven Metal**

It's not known what exactly Dwarven metal is made of in Skyrim, perhaps a type of bronze or brass. This metal is clearly supposed to have an air of mystery to it, so only the Dwemer know what it is and how to make it, and they aren't going to tell us anytime soon...
___
**Orichalcum**

Orichalcum has, and has since been a material of fantasy worlds. It's been known to have several different iterations (sometimes it's a bronze alloy smelted with a special mineral, others it's own mineral mined from the earth), but in the end, Orichalcum has never actually existed. 

**[IdoNOThateNEVER](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/1i023d/the_metals_of_skyrim_ingame_and_real_life/caztktp)** added that Orichalcum exists to this day in Greece
___

**Malachite**

Malachite does exist! It's Copper Carbonate -a type of mineral- and forms basically as a type of runoff from copper deposits. It's not uncommon
___
**Quicksilver**

Quicksilver in Skyrim is used as a type of binding agent (I think) alongside Moonstone to make Elven weapons and armor. However, adding Mercury to the intense heat of a smelter would  turn it into mercury gas, which is intensely toxic to just about everything.
___
**Moonstone**

Moonstone's primary use in Skyrim is for Elven and glass armor/weapons. In real life, so it's entirely possible that they are the same mineral. Moonstone is hard and brittle, so forging it with other metals would be required to make it effective for battle (though I'm sure it can't be ""forged"" at all).
___
**Ebony**

Ebony in Skyrim is an extremely precious resource(its mining is protected under Imperial law). It's a type of volcanic product commonly found on Vvardenfell, Obsidian would make terrible armor, but a small blade (like an arrowhead) can be easily made and put to deadly effect, as Obsidian is incredibly sharp - but also quite brittle. In-game, Ebony can be worked and forged like a metal, though this is simply not possible with obsidian as melting down the volcanic glass would render it useless. 
___
**Corundum** 

Saved this for last. I actually knew what corundum was before researching. In Skyrim Corundum seems to be a type of metal, being stained all sorts of colors. In fact, Corundum is the base gemstone for rubies and sapphires, which are nothing more than flawed pieces of solidified alumina. Interestingly enough, one of steels base components is Aluminum, though there's a lot more that's needed in its smelting than just Corundum. 
___

Thanks for reading if you got this far! I did a bunch of this research a while ago and decided to write up out of boredom now. I though at least a few people would find this interesting!

Tl;Dr: I translated them from the Elder Futhark runic language

NOTE: These translations were of my own work and other people who filled in the blanks or corrected me on things. I do not claim entire credit for it.

The runes on the bee one translate to GIANT/THOR-HAIL-NEED

The runes on the butterfly one translate to JOY-ICE-SORROW

The runes on the dragonfly one translate to NEED-HORSE-LAKE.

The runes on the moth one translate to DAY-NEED.

The runes on the torchbug one translate to YEW TREE-HORSE-HAIL-NEED.

There have been many theories created while this thread has existed
______________________________________________________________________________________________
EDIT: This has blown up from runes on bug jars to theories about a religious Altmer trial to wipe mankind off of the plane of existence and from Tamriel. There's two likely theories here: the first one should be easy to find, for which I will include a link: http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/nklj2/you_know_those_runes_on_the_lids_of_the_bug_jars/c39wpky

EDIT:EDIT: Upon recent investigation, so this could still mean something. A more accurate translation and meaning of the sets of runes: http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/nklj2/you_know_those_runes_on_the_lids_of_the_bug_jars/c39z2gn

I'm feeling this is required for the lazy
______________________________________________________________________________________________
Someone noticed the connection between the five cities Morthal, Dawnstar, and Windhelm,  and realized they formed a Pentagon. He also noticed three dragon ""sanctuaries"" or whatever you may call them, Mzinchaleft, and the Tower Stone formed a smaller pentagon within it, making a transmutation circle. In the general area of the middle of the circle, committed genocide in those ctities

______________________________________________________________________________________________
The second one expands upon the Weynon stones. The guy figured out that the Thalmor are trying to erase mankind from existence

Crystal Tower

Red Tower

Tree-sap

Orchalc

Khajiit

all of which were destroyed or deactivated. The most significant and only remaining one are the Brass Tower and Snow-Throat, and the disappearance of the tower and therefore Numidium may tie in with the disappearance of the Dwemer. Snow Throat is the only active one. Each of these towers have stones which bind them to Nirn, and the theorist concluded that the Weynon Stones bound Snow Throat. This is why the Thalmor have been waging war on Skyrim; so they can destroy Snow Throat or the Weynon Stones, either way destroying the last tower and wiping mankind from existence.

A new wiki is out 
The Elder Scrolls wiki is using Skyrim's (and the Elder Scrolls) new-found popularity in order to break ahead.

Basically

Feel free to disagree and share your opinions.


**edit:** With the amount of discussion this topic has garnered, but I'm proud that I was able to open a discussion and let people give their feedback.  Read over the comments and decide which wiki **you** prefer to use, if not both!

You know who'd like some fair treatment? The employee. The average game developer, complex and WORKING games haven't gotten too much easier to make, people are just willing to put up with more shit to make them.

**My fucking point:**
PS3, but they try to. Thats better than most. Understand that you know less than them, come off your pedestal, you could not manage their team better. Porting is not pushing a button and walking away. It's hard and stupid, and filled with endless QA testing. They're not going to give you a date because they don't fucking know. Champ up and act like adults.

Also I will try the tea wash on the pages and also singing a few of them to add to the aged look. I will probably also spring for the art book and dragon figure on ebay.. You guys are all so awesome!

 The idea is to unite all of the separate screens into a single tabbed interface

Here is a [inventory mockup](http://i.img.tc/21499753.png), and there are selection check boxes so that one action can be performed on multiple items at once. There is a character tab, which functions as a vanity window.

Here is a [magic mockup](http://i.img.tc/21499771.png) the important points are: Spell icons, no mass action checkboxes.

Here is a [skills mockup](http://i.img.tc/21499789.png), with the most important one being the ability to click on a specific skill and be taken to its tree instantly, rather than trying to rotate through the wheel.   

 On each page most things are now more noticeable at a glance

 I still feel like these need some work, perhaps a gesture based interaction model could work? Despite being early days, I feel that this kind of design would already be a lot more usable.

Just thought I would drop a line and talk to everyone for a minute

However, the sub is *flooded* with screenshots of every single new thing in the game.

*""Check out how badass my character is in the stalhrim armor!""*

*""LOL the rieklings look derpy""*

*""Full dragonbone, with dragon boots and a dragon cape mod.""*

Now, so we're bored with it"" post. *Dragonborn* and *Dawnguard* are awesome expansions - they add a lot of really good looking stuff to the game. If you're experiencing that for the first time, it's natural for you to want to show it off.

My complaint is that this flood of screenshots is burying content which is actually original and interesting. People asking for help with quests

If you didn't know

I don't think all screenshots need to go away - if you find something truly unique, post away. But I would humbly ask that you take your collections of vanity shots, landscape studies, and ""check out how cool my [fill in the blank]"" posts over there.

**TL;dr:** This sub is being flooded with screenshots that should be [submitted elsewhere](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkyrimPorn/)

P.S. If I'm the only one here with this opinion

**EDIT:** I don't care about screenshots. I care about users that post dozens and dozens of posts that are generic

Aela the Huntress has been my companion through thin and thick for most of my character's experience in Skyrim. I can't count the number of times when I missed a crucial shot

Wherever I journeyed, whether it was a frozen mountainside or the deep dark of Blackreach. She was such a good companion for me, since I'm a stealthy archer. She was similarly skilled, so she never gave our position away, even to the most perceptive enemies. 

Long story short

Tonight, where's Aela? I looked behind me, and she was nowhere to be seen. Bah, the woman's gotten herself lost again. But usually, if I waited for a second or two, I'd be able to see her torch waving in the distance, and I'd only have to wait a little while for her to catch up. 

Which is why I decided to wait. But... then, and I knew that battle was upon me. Cursing my luck at this ill timing, I nonetheless drew forth my bow. I'd have to do without Aela's help. 

The battle went as usual. The dragon circled me and tried to fry me with its fiery breath, until the dragon got impatient and landed. 

When I recovered from the shock, who reeled at the impact. I drew my swords with a battlecry and began to slice at the dragon's head. 

The beast recovered quickly - too quickly - and those jaws lined with deadly teeth snapped at me. I could feel my heartbeat, and found few. Worst of all, I had no way to stop the dragon's relentless assault. I'd been too reckless; I should have only closed the distance after weakening the dragon further. 

And then; the sound of an arrow, of a woman with a bow, rocking that Forsworn armor, defiant and valiant. She'd come to my rescue again. I sighed in relief and gave myself time to recover. I retreated and let Aela take the heat for a while. Surely, she'd bring forth her shield... 

...but she did not. She was still aiming at the dragon's head when the beast snapped at her, and thrashed around with her body gnashing between its teeth before throwing her lifeless corpse away like a rag. 

All I saw was red. My thu'um had once again filled my throat

When the dragon finally fell at my feet and I felt its soul surging into me, mourning the death of my companion, who had once again saved my life - this time, at the cost of her own. Then I realized what I had to do. I couldn't leave her body to rot in the wilderness. She deserved dignity in death, at the very least. 

It was surprisingly easy to find the body, sighing; and then realized that the corpse was wearing a headdress. 

Aela wears a circlet. 

What the... and then it hit me. 

I realized that my valiant hero had actually been a Forsworn forager. 

I turned around to the sound of footsteps and saw Aela the Huntress, and then she said, 

""We've stopped. What is it?"" 

I stared at her stupendously
