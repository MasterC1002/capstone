1375207343.0,1jd2zf,Thoughts on building a castle today.,zyphelion,27,1,19,"Over the past year I've been a member of this sub I've seen some absolutely magnificent constructions, to make the dream of building your own castle possible. Now I invite you all to join me in this discussion; to share


**Preparations**

1. A plot of land. Castle's aren't very small so you need good space. Most would prefer to place it quite a bit from the rest of civilization so it isn't contrasted by the Walmart next door. The ground itself must be up to par
2. Permits. You obviously need to be allowed to build something as big as a castle
3. Construction. Someone needs to build that thing
4. (Courtesy of /u/pieeatingbastard [+2]) What is the purpose of the building you want to have done? Do you want to create something historically accurate


**Features** - This bit is more about personal preferences.

1. What kind of castle would you like to have built? A small medieval fort or a grand 17th century castle? There are tons of different styles to choose from
2. Moat? Drawbridge? Battlements? Spires? Towers? A dungeon? What would you like to see?
3. Modernisation. Given that we enjoy certain comforts that wasn't available a thousand years ago, heating, and even internet? It would certainly ramp up the price. But maybe it depends on if you want to make it liveable or just a place for you to chill.


**Rounding it all up**

1. There will be many curious individuals that would like to take a closer look. How would you handle tourists and nosy neighbours? What are the social implications in owning (and building) your own castle? Would you lend parts of it out to production companies to record films? What would you do if you are approached by roleplay/LARP:ers and re-enactment enthusiasts?
2. How would you use it in a practical sense? Would you live there? How do you keep others out when you aren't there? If you live in something like [Carondelet castle](http://i.imgur.com/2YlWbMP.jpg) (posted by [Hoohill ~5 months ago here](http://www.reddit.com/r/castles/comments/1971qi/carondelet_belgium_this_small_medieval_castle_its/))
3. How would one maintain it? 


**The Price**

Given the wide array of options we have in building ourselves a castle, sorry)](http://i.imgur.com/NeojPvs.jpg)? How much would the upkeep be? It would probably take an enormous amount of energy to keep it heated over the winter. Burning wood is an option, but it would require massive amount of work to keep the temperature level, unless you only heat the necessary living quarters (kitchen and bedroom).


**That's about it!** There might be a point or two that I've missed, be it history, books, movies, and even games. *What is your source of inspiration?*",,False,t5_2qrft,True

As a brief bit of background

More specifically:

What would make you decide if you were going to build a castle in a given location? Alternatively

I notice a lot of castles seem to be near streams or rivers

What is to stop the enemy from simply leaving a force just big enough to keep the defenders from cutting their supply lines and then having the rest of their army march on? Am I grossly overestimating the size of a middle ages army at a few thousand?

Are the towns often seen near these castles built to protect the town

How many defenders is a realistic number for a large, I'm thinking about things like the inevitable corpses, dead animals, and other general waste. On a related note, I cannot imagine the garderobe being very comfortable and it must certainly be the one of the most hated places in the castle.

Sieges, but was it really used that often? Or, was it mostly sitting around waiting for one side to surrender, starve to death, or die of horrible diseases? How useful would primitive cannon (called bombards?) be for the attackers / defenders? I found some examples where they were used with limited success such as the siege of Constantinople in 1453, but I cannot find examples on when they were failures - or what could go wrong with them. So, what could go wrong with early cannons? I understand they could explode

In the event of a siege, logistics in the middle ages were not nearly as good as they are now.

How did you mitigate diseases in this age? Or was it just ""If he dies

We love our castles and manors;

1) [This](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xNhpqJQqR90/TIqbuM_sF-I/AAAAAAAAIZY/-5qTuEs_HeE/s1600/Brougham+Manor+1.jpg) is Brougham Manor, we went to visit Brougham castle originally but the entrance fee was around £15 each, too much for a passing visit. Just down the road though, was Brougham Manor. It's in the process of being restored, entry was just whatever you could afford, we made up for it with our tea and cake purchases.

The place was amazing

Pretty much the whole place is open to explore (you just have to step over a few of the builders to get to places

On our way back from visiting this we came across another place... Not strictly a castle so apologies for that

[This](http://i.imgur.com/M5RY5.jpg) place was huge, elaborate chandeliers, huge dining tables.  

[View looking out from the main entrance](http://i.imgur.com/W7zeE.jpg).

[This is around the back of the building](http://i.imgur.com/NdPVO.jpg) in the gardens... We only had an hour before they closed the gates up so we couldn't get around to seeing everything.

[There were 3 of these](http://i.imgur.com/bLvt4.jpg) that we saw scattered across the grounds
