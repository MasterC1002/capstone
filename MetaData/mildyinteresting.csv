I'm just saying that it IS possible to make a decent living in a career that your English major has prepared you for. You got into this field of study because you love to read and write. And sure, and magazines. Write for yourself. And apply for every single editor/writer position you can find. Thanks to the internet, you don't have to live in NYC to work for a publishing house anymore.
Internet startups need content writers. That's you. Look into freelance writing. My brother lives in Costa Rica and supports himself and a family of four through his freelance writing. There are options.
An English degree is not useless. So take heart, you can always teach English 101 at your local community college.",,False,self,t5_2ti58,False,,
