I believe the number of serial killers is falling, and will continue to do so for the forseeable future. Only highly organized killers will be able to accumulate 10+ victims. Your thoughts?",ANAL_POWER_GENERATOR,42,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/serialkillers/comments/zh67c/serial_murder_is_a_lot_harder_to_get_away_with/

 In the last few years we've seen the rise of 'stranger danger' culture. We're perpetually bombarded with human interest stories about pedophiles and rapists. People of my generation in general seem less trusting of strangers than my parents' generation did at my age. Women in particular are taught to maintain constanst vigilance to the threat of (sexual) attack.

Although I believe the police nowadays don't like to talk to the media about serial killers, Jeffrey Dahmer et al means that people knows they exist now, and are less likely to put themselves in the positions of vulnerability serial killers have created for their victims in the past.

**2)** Furthermore, or incapacitate them as soon as they become aware of the killer's presence. These two methods do not fit the MOs of lots of past serial killers and I believe many potential killers will feel the same.

**3)** I'm not an expert on law enforcement agencies, they have become a lot more cohesive and effective. Background checks, monitoring and the collection of forensic evidence have improved exponentially. For example, it is now possible for the police togather the thoughts of non tech-savvy suspects who have access to computers and the internet and base a conviction on those alone.

***TODAY'S serial killer must be intelligent. He must assimilate to society. He must have a clean record and background. He must kill his victims quickly and brutally and leave no trace of his crimes behind. In short, and this type of serial killer has no chance in today's climate.***

Psychiatrist Donald Lunde's book ""Murder and Madness"" is great too; there's a lot of good material about Kemper and the other two Santa Cruz murderers infamous in that era

Also, with Stephane Bourgoin: http://vimeo.com/53059340

Bourgoin's not a very good interviewer, but the way he describes them is both poignant and exceptionally horrible, especially his strangely admiring, haunted reminiscences of Marianne Pesce. I've heard that this interview upset him so badly that it's the main reason why we've seen no interviews with him since then.

I asked him this but he didn't answer.    

2. Are you going to blame your actions on your childhood?  
I reworded this so it was less aggressive. He said ""Yes I had a rough childhood but I didn't know it until I was older. But yes the poor and almost non-existant relationship I had with my father was part of whats wrong

3. Do you have any regrets about the crimes you've committed?  
He mentioned in a previous letter that he did not have regret about his other crimes but felt remorse for the murders because their families didn't deserve that. I modified this question and asked how the murders were different than previous crimes that he did not have remorse for. John: ""You asked about other crimes that I don't feel remorse for. I set fire to a field while playing with (illegible word) me and another kid. It was next to my school I was like 8 or 9 years old. Nothing got burned down just the weeds in the field. I also used to break into cars

4. I'd like to ask any and all serial killers about their mothers.  
He said: ""Yes

5. What would be the defining point for you as a serial killer?  
""You asked if there was a defining moment. Not really. I had a breakdown of every thing in my life many losses and felt abandoned by everyone just real depressed and angry. THe year before my first victim I lost my dad

6. Have you ever met another serial killer?

Yes, so I've been watching even more real crime shows. It fascinates me a lot, and then I stumbled upon this subreddit. I think I like this place, but have to admit... I am kinda creeped out by some of the posts too. Which is a good sign I guess. 

So, life is such a beautiful thing and people are always loved and missed by some one. It is not anyones right to take them away. I don't feel any sympathy for serial killers and their crimes and I really can't stomach the more gruesome details of what they did. Yet the whole process of how they came to be and how they are caught fascinates me. Upon finding this subreddit and reading through all the links here I feel like delving into the subject a bit more. But I have this crazy worry that I'll eventually won't be put off by the gore anymore. And who knows if there's a sliding scale from there on? I mean - I don't believe you can become a serial killer from reading about it. But I was just wondering:

Has delving into this subject changed you in any way? Has it shifted the boundaries of what you accept as normal?

Predators such as wolves impacted the forest itself, the rivers, everything. It's when Man steps on that things go to hell.

i will translate some of the main things he talks about
i added some explanations in []'s for the stuff he says that is implied in russian but gets lost in translation. judging by his intonations and by the way he misdirected his answers
russian is my third language, i was surprised just by how oblivious he is to his own guilt given the often quoted ""i am a monster"" bs and ""preserve my brain"" crap he gave the reporters. 

**LET'S GET TO IT**:
he talks about how his mother told him that his brother was cannibalized &amp; that his mother told him to be careful of cannibals. he is **asked if he loved god when he was a child (or ever) and c. says he doesn't know because his childhood was about surviving more than anything else** (ie not about religion or family relationships). he remembers crying because he was hungry and only having a morsel of old bread to eat.
the interviewer asks chikatilo if he feels sorry for the little red riding hood or if he ever had (when he heard the tale in his youth). he says ""yes of course
**interviewer asks if he ever thought of what will happen if/when he meets his victims in the afterlife, doctors and **society have been asking me why i did not hang myself [ie hang himself instead of going on a killing rampage]** and all these doctors who have written about the stress i must have been under to commit the crimes and such, and i can answer them that **if i was a more standard person, then i would have drank myself to death or hanged myself, but i have gone through my life being despised and having people pull the rug from under my feet** - everywhere (ie at work and at home) [so he is saying that he could bear the building pressure of needing to murder and stress *after* the murder caused by having to hide it from everyone only because he was ""not standard"" and was used to ""living in hell"" at work and elsewhere. so basically he is implying that if people in his life had not been so horrible to him, then he would not be already used to ""living in hell"" and he would of killed himself or drank himself to death instead of indulging his desires to kill and being able to tolerate the pressures of being a serial killer ---- he is not to blame..it's society's fault for developing his stress-resistance :)..]"" 

int.: are you tortured by nightmares?
chi.: **my psycho-sexual or sexual-psychiatric thoughts and perversions are piling up in my head.** they studied me, that i can be shot only if i am healthy, but o.k. never mind that, let's just say that my nightmares usually torture me when i have severe headaches because of the concussion i suffered after they [the police] took me in and also from when i was working as manager in the mines and tried to take away the vodka from the mine workers and they tried to poison me for that** (he got a concussion on that occasion as well). i do exercises in my cell, sometimes my heart feels like it is pounding so fast that it will explode and then i think - so be it, all this will end sooner, and i do this when my head aches
he talks about how he knew some big shots in the communist party etc and that he was really a somebody

I haven't read them in a while so I'm going to go back and check them out to see if I see anything that might help.

Heres some patterns I've noticed about the victims(note: i haven't followed this case that much
All white females
All petite
In vulnerable situations(prostitutes)
All strangled
Most found in burlap sacks on the beach(does this guy work in the fishing industry perhaps?)

So, and(if i'm not mistaken) all victims are white.  The fact that they are petite also is interesting to me.  I'm assuming(i know i know, assume makes an ass out of you and me) he got pictures of them before meeting them since craigs list and all -- a SKs paradise, unfortunately.  So he probably narrowed them down to fit his 'type.' So he might be a smaller guy himself if he purposely chose petite women.

Any one else?

Edit: One more thing.  I think they're using the media to draw him out to communicate with them.  I read an article posted a few days ago that was talking about a phone call he made to a victims sister in 09 IIRC.

1302983436.0,grmkj,Recommended reading material?,tiger_lily,1,0,4,"Hey guys.  So I've seen a few comments about wanting some good books on serial killers/their pathology

I highly recommend anything by John Douglas

Another good book is ""Those Who Fight Monsters"" by Robert Ressler.  He is also FBI and actually taught John Douglas what he knows.  In this book he interviews different killers, Berkowitz(his whole schtik about a dog telling him to murder people? Bullshit.) and Bundy.  He has an interesting story in the beginning when Kemper scared the shit out of him. Basically, he'd gotten close enough to Kemper to have a great rapport with him, but in turn let his own guard down(a big no no).. so he interviewed him alone, with just a button to press to alert guards to come get him.  The interview went great and at the end he pressed the button..  no one came.  He kept pressing for something like 15 minutes, no one came.  Kemper, being the manipulative smart ass he is, talking about martial arts to bide time lol, Ressler decided never to allow an agent to interview alone

Fiction wise, Hannibal Lector is a badass and while his actions are rephrensible, he's awesome.

“Whats going on?  Who are you?”  Dons shakily stammered.

“ah, but his terrible eyes never left Don.

“Please

“oh trust me, because i am about to enlighten you.”  the same sneer that Don had seen before twisted the mans lips and narrowed his eyes. that evil, all knowing smile would haunt him until his death.  Most would describe the smile as evil, as well as the man, but whether something is truly evil or not is based on morals, which vary from person to person. if you were to ask any great villain, such as Adolph Hitler or Osama Bin Laden

“enlighten?  Wh- Who are you?”  Dons head was clear enough to be ashamed at his voice breaking.

“Ah!  this is something i just recently thought up.  i want you to name me.  call me whatever you like.”  a queer look of excitement and glee went through his whole body.

“you

“name me.”

1317934869.0,l3eoa,Short story that belongs here (part one),Crucks,1,1,3," This story begins in a suburb near Sacramento California.  It was a beautiful June day, however, one bath
  
Don sat at the kitchen table eating an Italian sausage omelet while Carol got dressed.  As he ate he looked back on his relationship with his wife.  They had met in high school but never talked to each other until a reunion 5 years post graduation.  They danced together most of the night, into a beautiful marriage.  He couldn't help but smile himself when he remembered her smile that first morning.  the way her curly brown hair was tousled and frizzed, her beautiful blue eyes crinkling as she smiled.  The thought of his child that would be coming in 8 months brought that feeling into his stomach identical to the one he felt when he asked Carol to marry him.  That feeling of excitement, nervous fear, and that electricity in his belly.
  
Carol roused Don from his day dream, pleasantly surprised at his sentimental tone.  as he stepped out of his climate controlled home and into the sunlight that was immediately hot on the back of his neck, he knew it would be a sweaty day.  Don hated sweating, it made him nervous, which made him sweat.  his stocky, muscular build didn’t help ether.  he hurried to his car where the air conditioning waited.
  
Dons drive to work was uneventful, nothing was there.  as he sat  in his cubicle, typing at his computer, his phone went off in his pocket.  a text from ‘Wife’ read, ‘gona be home late,  obstetrician appointment.’  Don, who's earlier loving mood had been replaced with frustration because of his computer
  
When Don arrived home he immediately flopped onto the couch.  with his face buried in the cushions he thought about his career.  being an accountant wasn't the most emotionally rewarding job for Don, and he didn't plan on doing it forever.  You see Don was an aspiring musician.  he played the guitar primarily but he owned many instruments, and enjoyed playing many genres.  most of his Friends were musical as well and would come over to play.
  
thinking about his occupation wasn't making Dons mood any better so he decided to go make some music.  as he descended the stairs to the basement, he spun around to see a lean man with a sneering smile and piercing green eyes.  the man wore a black fitted suit without a tie, his gaunt face was clean shaven, but it was his eyes that made Don Peer freeze.  They were the most magnificently beautiful eyes he had ever seen, the green was the color of pine needles with flecks so dark they were almost black.   however that was not the mans awe striking feature ether.  it was the way he looked at Don, like he was the mans dinner.  He was a predator.  

CRITIQUE AWAY!!  I have the second part written if you want to read the rest.
