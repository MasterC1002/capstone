He gets on the train and immediately finds a spot. The train was quiet and clean. Everyone was minding their own business. He falls to sleep and remains undisturbed.
Jerry can sleep on a public train without a problem much like how he can be himself in public without worrying about other people's opinions. He then wakes up to the fat naked man and even though everyone else has scuttled away

Elaine:

Elaine attempts to connect with a fellow woman and it never really hits off greatly. It ends up just being mild small talk and just when Elaine feels like she's doing well
Elaine then finds herself in trouble and instead of finding a solution

George:

George finds himself in a lucky spot next to a beautiful woman
The women begins to chat him up and he proceeds to feel more confident with himself. He then risks a job interview to chase this woman
George then thinks everything is going well and starts to wonder if he's a real adult when he muses on how being in a hotel room with this woman is like being a classic male lead in an old movie (the William Holden remark). The woman then ignores him by using him just to make money (IE feeling better about herself much like how most women who date George are just trying to feel better or going through a ""phase"").
Much like George's life

Kramer:

Kramer's experience is hectic and crazy. He immediately cant find a seat and just like real life
Kramer then overcomes common sense and overhears two guys talking about making money on horses. So much like his daily life
Kramer then finds himself in a jam with a guy chasing him and is saved by a homeless undercover cop who Kramer did not realize was there
And much like Kramer's life

Final note: Much like their daily lives, George loses out and Kramer gains.",,False,self,t5_2qt3b,False,,
