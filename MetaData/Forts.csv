This is how my living room normally looks:

* [Angle 1](http://imgur.com/dXO4o)
* [Angle 2](http://imgur.com/2TWUM)

Here we have cleared a space for the floor and turned around the couch and chairs to act as the main supports:

* [Angle 1](http://imgur.com/Lfxo1)
* [Angle 2](http://imgur.com/yYWBd)

Then we dragged my mattress in from my bedroom and made it into the fort's floor

* [Angle 2](http://imgur.com/Pi1ny)

And here is a view from inside. Note the rope lights and the entertainment features:

* [Inside](http://imgur.com/fT7Wv)

That was three days ago. We're still hanging out in the fort

This is a good fort for several reasons:

* Mattress floor. Remember when you built a fort as a kid and you wanted to sleep in it
* Entertainment. The TV is holding up one side of it and the DVD case is holding up another
* Rope lights. The interior lighting makes for some seriously nice ambiance. 
* (In)convenient placement. The fort blocks off the kitchen, they do).

We also have plans to make a few expansions. There's enough space to add a northern wing,,False,,t5_2raqa,False,,True

* [Ladder down](http://i592.photobucket.com/albums/tt9/SoAwesomeItHurts/Fort%20Camping/IMG_0734.jpg)

* [Note honeycomb support and railings](http://i592.photobucket.com/albums/tt9/SoAwesomeItHurts/Fort%20Camping/IMG_0736.jpg)

* [Height put into scope](http://i592.photobucket.com/albums/tt9/SoAwesomeItHurts/Fort%20Camping/IMG_0739.jpg)

* Edit: Learning to format properly. 

* 20/M. All Uni students. Construction commenced when we were 17. Honeycombing WAS intentional
Lots of fun to stay up the entire night and drink brewskis/ cook steak on a portable propane BBQ. The trees surrounding were pruned of all lower branches so the only way to get in other than climb the ladder is to climb up a tree like climbing up a fire pole.

it started small, i couldn't stop. it also helped that we had a ridiculous amount of sheets and blankets laying around. like the winchester mystery house, i just kept adding and adding until pretty much 80% of the dining room was my fort. 

i think the final material count was something like 5 chairs, 1 pillow case (for the ""door""), 1 dining room table and a handful of pushpins. 

i mostly just lounged around in there. drank a few beers

i had more pictures but a few months ago, i was wrong.

So as we sat in the fort of cardboarditude, explaining us how we needed to stop wasting time and get to work on our final projects. We pulled our cardboard blast shield to close the fort off completely.
