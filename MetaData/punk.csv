I just want to put out a reminder to people that racism, speak up!! Don't be silent. Silencing hatred is an act of defense for people that are hated for being different, it is not a violation of the spirit of free speech. Words like ""faggot"" used as attacks are meant to silence people for their beliefs/orientations and not a valid form of rational discussion. It doesn't matter ""how you meant it"" when you use certain words in certain ways. The effect doesn't change.

We'll conduct the election in the comments of this post. Here's the deal:

1. Only one album per comment.

2. Remember

3. Remember, *my favourite band at the moment* list.

4. Read through or search through all the comments

5. Don't hesitate to include some folk-punk, but don't over do it. Use votes for these sparingly so that we avoid a 'Punk Rock list' that's dominated by dash genres.

6. Please upvote this post so plenty of people see it and the election gets a nice wide audience. But if this post gets too many upvotes and you've come across it from /r/all

7. Don't be an asshole to your parents. They did more for you than you know.

So once you're punk, they shouldn't be given shit for exploring different music and utilizing the popularity of American Idiot to reach out to their true fans. I also get why true punks hate on them for doing things like playing on American Idol and Americas got talent

Edit: I grew up with American idiot. That's the first green day I knew. It seems like all you guys that are upset about the ""new"" green day grew up with their older stuff. Don't get me wrong, thanks for helping me see that

Edit 2: In response to all of the NOFX comments, and punk sound even though they're music and some of their messages have changed. Fat mike definitely is not writing songs now just for money or because they ""need"" to make an album. He's still in in it for the music along with smelly hefe and Melvin. Theyre still punk all the way. Green day, on the other hand, don't really have a set message anymore. They completely changed their music, mindset, and image. Some say its for the worse, but I think it's just fine for a band to do that as long as they're not entirely selling out. And I don't believe is entirely selling out. Why can't bands just be like Blink-182 and continually improve their music? (See what I did there? ",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/punk/comments/10h09n/lets_talk_about_green_day/

Does anyone think that a similar policy may be beneficial here? 

Eliminating videos—single songs from YouTube and not *all* discussion—from artists like Bad Brains, Bad Religion, Circle Jerks, Black Flag and Against Me! might be beneficial to the community in that it'll force folks to generate more intriguing discussions and share what's happening in their local scenes.

I realize that a heavy hand of moderation doesn't fit within the punk ethos—and I do recognize that some contributors aren't active participants in their local scenes—but it might be an interesting experiment to keep things fresh and interesting.
