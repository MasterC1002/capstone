that being said...

&gt; Marijuana is a massage for the mind, myself included, it can be an all day afair. Or all week afair. But when the weeks turn into months it can be useful to take a break. Think of it as a rest period. 

Tell your body and mind that all though this vacation is comfortable, can start to wear away at you, and eventually you are going to get really tired. You are going to feel your tolerance skyrocket and those sober moments are going to feel more like a ball and chain. 

Force yourself to take a T break once in a while. Once you finish your stash

As the country begins to tear away the mental blindfold that is prohibition, enjoy it, but remember what i stated earlier. 

Getting high is much better when you can enjoy being sober as well.

By 12:30pm I had come down to about a [5] and was also just now leaving my house. Despite ultimately planning on eating at the food trucks, she'd have to charge me for them. Perplexed as to whether or not laws regarding store purchases had been reversed, I replied simply ""I know."" Then she continued. 

""I can give you these two and charge you for them or I can give you this entire bag for free.""

Thirty seconds later I was walking out of the gas station with a small trash bag containing no less than thirty assorted flavors of doughnuts. I finally left the gas station and about a mile down the road I realized that I needed gas. This was particularly frustrating for the obvious reason that I had just left the gas station however that frustration was short-lived as I reached into my back seat and grabbed a doughnut. Regardless of my gas situation

A few miles later I pulled into another gas station. This is one of those gas stations that seems to be a hangout for cops. I don't know why but they do all of their chatting inside by the bathrooms. As I pulled up to the pump, so I wasn't worried about an encounter with the officer. As I was about to get out of my car, the cop was shifting some stuff around and lifted, for a split second, a massive bag of marijuana. I'm talking close to a pound. Then the cop turned around and looked at me to see if I had seen that. Not knowing how else to act in that situation, I laughed. As I got out of the car, the officer (probably noticing the giant bag of donuts hanging out of my car) smiled and said ""Want some?"" to which I quickly replied ""Depends how much you're selling it for."" We both shared a hearty chuckle and then the cop closed his trunk and drove off.

August 1st, a pipe, grinder, scale and 2 baggies on me. At the end of the month, I was given a no-contact order between the two friends, one of whom I've been best friends with since 6th grade. I was given a plea bargain to drop the felony to a Misdemeanor, which included 100 hours of community service, LADC counseling, or take 10 days in jail. I took the jail time. I spent part of my winter vacation from college in jail. While in jail, that I would accidentally fuck up by getting a speeding ticket
As of midnight today, I'm still in college getting my chemistry degree, and my life is still on track. I don't know where to really post this, but I figure you guys may appreciate it.

TL;DR-Got arrested, just got off probation 2 hours ago. Drunk.

Now, so we just do whatever the heck we want most of the time. So I'm at the sink, and I'd just put the cool water in my bong when the sound caught my attention.

Casually, then they saw me and the daughter blurts out, 'see, even the neighbors smoke pot... and they aren't crackheads!'

Her parents are teachers and I assumed they aren't cool with trees, for maybe 20 seconds when I realized that I had been holding my bong in my hand the whole time.

I ran inside and packed a bowl. Yikes!

Anyway

7 am: I wake up. I am a 3D artist

830 am: I am fully baked out of my mind. I continue working on my senior thesis project, after not having eaten or showered yet this day.

2 pm: One of the faculty members at my school informs me that I've been chosen to receive the Artistic Achievement Award at my college. This award is only given to one person in each department at the college. This award comes with a number of perks

230 pm: My dad emails me back and lets me know that he just happens to be in town for his job

5 pm: I am at my apartment getting ready to go drink with my dad. I'm 22, I get a little skating in, practice my kickflips and hardflips a little, and my dad meets me at the pub, literally 100 paces from my apartment. I love this pub. We have a great conversation, his engineering buddies are very impressed and congratulatory towards the award that I received, and my dad pays for all the drinks. Fucking great time.


9:39 pm (right now): I've ended the day chillin' with a childhood friend that I don't get to see often, and drinking a 40 of Labatt while playing Skyrim.

9:40 pm (actually right now): if you've actually read this wall of fucking text, and I am well, WELL-stoned. [10]

 I have found an immense amount of information about cannabis/marijuana since I began studying it a few years ago in the legal, for the reasons I will give below.  So, I've decided to write this rather lengthy article to help educate those with little experience on the history, scientific and legal realities of the use of this plant. I guarantee you will find this read to be fascinating no matter your experience, and I promise it won’t get too detailed.  I researched and wrote it completely myself.  There is so much more I could include but I want this to be accessible to anyone.  If you have any more questions, please comment or PM me.

**Legal disclaimer: I am neither a lawyer nor a doctor

Names:
**Q. What are the names of cannabis
A. First, the term marijuana or marihuana was used by the government and media to tie the plant to the anti-Hispanic sentiment that was going around the country at the same time (2). There are hundreds of other names for the plant and its derivatives: weed, Mary Jane, pot, hemp (the low THC plant used for making paper and fabric, among other things), grass, skunk (because it can smell like skunk spray), some of which are quite interesting.

**Q. What’s a strain?**
A. Just like with flowering plants, Cannabis indica and Cannabis ruderalis. Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica usually contain higher levels of THC and Cannabinoids and are therefore the kind most commonly smoked. Cannabis ruderalis contains lower levels of these compounds and is more often used for industrial production, such as hemp.  However, all three of these varieties can be bred with each other to produce hybrid plants with different physical and compound producing properties. The various hybrids and breeds lead to different “strains” of cannabis and I will get in to the effects of these in the scientific use section. You may hear strain names such as Afghan Kush (an indica strain from the Hindu Kush mountain range) or White Widow (a hybrid strain, white for the whiteness of the crystals covering the bud, and widow as in “black widow” because its effects are very strong) or Outer Space (a sativa strain that has strong cerebral and creative effects).  Some of the names are rather crude, but remember
 
**Q. You just used the term “bud”.  Why?**
A. If someone is smoking, they are probably consuming the bud of the plant. Cannabis is a plant or bush just like any other plant or bush in the beautiful flora of this world.  It grows from the earth, it buds, flowers, uses leaves to collect solar energy, and uses wind to pollinate and spread. The buds of the plant are where the highest concentrations of THC and cannabinoids are found. Properly cultivated, these buds will produce crystals which grow on trichomes, the leaves, but they may have unpleasant side effects. If you are buying cannabis to consume, but is not necessarily indicative of high cannabinoid content as some believe.

The families need HELP! Immediately. As in now. 

They need grief counselors, mental health professionals.
Many will need to leave work for the next few weeks/months.
Many also don't have the luxury of a salary or insurance or the option of just...... grieving. 
It's not just today and tomorrow. It's a week from now
They have to clean out a room. Pick up toys...for one last time. Put blankets and clothes away. Just..... I can't even begin to rationalize that thought.

So let's get to work. Let's get some volunteers in mental health on airplanes. Let's pay some hotel and air bills. Let's pay for dinner for the next week. Month. 
Let's put some money in an account for them so they can keep their lights on. 

Let's pay for some funerals. 

Let's do SOMETHING!!!

1. **Respect your environment:** clean up your trash

2. **Respect others around you:** treat the host of a party well

3. **Don't be a mooch:** if you don't have weed at a sesh with others

4. **Be knowledgeable:** don't act like a fucking idiot. If you call yourself an ent you're an ambassador to those who don't smoke. Represent.

5. **Don't be a stereotype:** don't reinforce the negative aspects of stoner culture.

6. **Don't let the weed control you:** weed isn't physically addicting, but do not let your life revolve around it.

7. **Be a chiller:** You got that high going on, do so. Don't tell anyone how to act when they are high. We are all different.
 
8. **Watch Grandma's Boy:** Like really. Go watch it.

9. **Enjoy what others enjoy:** Do you feel awkward at a party? Find a group sitting together and ask them questions. Refrain from your own opinion. People tend to generally want to know who the kind chiller is in the back of the party making everyone laugh and talk.

10. **Be happy:**Life is hard. It will always be hard. Take a hit

This will put hundreds out of work


On May 21st Los Angelenos will vote to choose between propositions regarding the medical marijuana community. Ents must be aware that they must vote YES ON F to protect patients

* Ordinance F is the only way that our City will properly and reasonably regulate medical marijuana but at the same time provide access to patients and caregivers that need medical marijuana.
* Provide increased revenue to our City to fund police, not 20% overall)
* Increase safety within dispensaries by requiring background checks of all managers
* Ensure safety and purity of the medicine for the sick and elderly by requiring dispensaries to test and analyze medical marijuana for pesticides and toxins;
* Demand financial transparency by requiring dispensaries to file with the City Controller an annual audit of its operations that is reviewed by a CPA;
* Reduce congestion in our neighborhoods by requiring dispensaries to provide parking for patients;
* Keep our children safe by denying access to children under any circumstances.
* Mandatory parking for dispensaries

Proposition D does not require testing for medicine, and does not require background checks for collective volunteers. Prop D also limits the amount of collectives in the Los Angeles area to 100, closing any shop that is not pre-ico/established before 2007. This would create a monopoly and eliminate free market opportunities to open collective, driving up the prices and wait times sky high.

YES ON PROP F is the only answer to evolving the relationship between medical marijuana patients and the neighborhoods and governments we live with. It benefits patients greatly while also offering economic incentives to communities offering much needed resources at a difficult time.

Back last September I had a road traffic accident on my motorbike involving a car and a 44 tonne truck.
I was in hospital for a total of 10 months originally with a 5% chance to survive. Heres a link to my AMA post for all who are interested about the full story - http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cuxm0/iama_18_year_old_who_survived_going_under_a/

Every single day, feel me?
I take a wack load of nerve pain killers such as pregabolin and amatriptaline also oxycodone and oxynorm for example to try and manage the pain

One single bowl of this wonderful all healing plant and it sets me free of this nerve pain making me able to live a normal as can be life
Now I'm slowly decreasing my pain killers with my pain team! 

This ones for all of you ENTs + Saplings and this amazing subreddit! 

TL;DR - Had an accident last September
