No, savegames are being lost, gameplay features are still disabled and gamebreaking bugs are still not fixed. That is unheard of almost 2 weeks after release. Even MMO's get this done faster. On top of that they are actively trying to patch out modding, delete mod topics and ban modders from origin. They have now almost disappeared from this once Maxis-filled community. Now that we need them the most for fixing bugs, patch notes and patch schedules. The game is out, we want to play it, do your jobs! We all paid you in full, apologize and fix it. You owe us!

Here on reddit the truth needs to be said. It is what puts the spotlight on the wrongdoings of EA and Maxis. What EA is desperately trying to hide and Lucy tries to cover with lies. It is what showed it to the world,,False,self,t5_2ryr3,False,,True
1363150573.0,1a75te,How It Came To This,Heinrich_Agrippa,1899,489,817,"So as the week has passed

-Draconian DRM which monitors you at all times

-Horrendously unreliable servers wholly incapable of supporting the number of players.

These two issues alone are damning. You must play under the strict EA terms and only when they allow you. You thought you purchased this game and own it
Then came the game itself:

-A supposedly required set of server-side calculations to allow for a simulation engine so complex and powerful that your puny computer alone wouldn’t be able to handle it – revealed to be a hollow lie concocted to justify not allowing any offline play.

-Cities that reach populations of hundreds of thousands of individual Sims – revealed to be another lie – the supposed hundreds of thousands of Sims being nothing but a number displayed on the screen desperately hoping you won’t notice your actual population is but a tenth of what it displays.

-Sim AI as dumb as shit. Quite literally, and sleep in the closest available house that night. Not a thing about them resembles a real life. They are all as mindless and generic as the water, electricity and sewage that all travel the same streets.

-Finally

Perhaps some may have found it in themselves to forgive the onerous DRM policies and unreliable server issues, the minority of existing Sims aren’t the dynamic individuals we were promised, but a shambling horde of mindless, indistinguishable zombies entirely incapable of any situational decision making.

How did it come to this? It’s been speculated that perhaps those who pushed for publication at EA considered the customers so stupid that they wouldn’t notice. While it’s abundantly evident that the EA executives think very little of their customers, that is when most sales would be made.

Once it was clear that the game was fundamentally broken, but perhaps some market research showed that Maxis customers didn’t overlap too heavily with other EA published subsidiaries. Perhaps they felt that the entire Maxis dynasty had been more or less burnt out anyway. And so a decision was made: burn the SimCity fan base and maximize immediate profit. They knew the outcome and thought “They won’t ever buy from EA again, but we won’t need them too. By then we’ll have cut our losses and grabbed as much money from this broken SimCity as possible. Then we’ll never bother with this franchise again.”
Everything served this purpose. The one hour beta ensured that no one would be able to see the deep and horrible flaws. Like sleazy used-car salespeople
Like good snake-oil salesmen

I see a lot of great ideas and I've seen the colorful Maxis rep reply

Hopefully Maxis/EA will get a nice list of improvements

I know we're all feeling raw and jaded from the launch (both sides alike)

**Please comment with links to good suggestion posts/comment with ideas

*[Bus Routes(and building off that

*Multiple Highway entrances. There are a few posts about it

*Improved pathing agents (no need to link posts

*One way streets. Simple idea

*[More connections between cities](http://imgur.com/jzgRPRf)

*[Zoning specific Services](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1a2lqt/zoning_vehicles_suggestion/)

*Improve emergency response. (Don't send all your firetrucks to 1 fire. Assign more based on traffic conditions ( and for god sakes send them down different roads)

*[Overpasses](http://www.roadstothefuture.com/I64-I295-Int-Feb0307-13.jpg) This already exists to a degree with roads climbing mountains

*[More tutorials](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1a3nf2/to_maxis_devs_heres_a_condensed_list_of_extremely/c8tskif). More than just highway planning. These will probably crop up as community-driven tutorials

*[More intuitive Region View](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1a3jf9/feature_request_when_i_am_in_spectator_mode/)

*[Be able to view previous messages/prompts](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1a3nf2/to_maxis_devs_heres_a_condensed_list_of_extremely/c8ttm7m)

*Enable city growth while in another city of your own.

*Increased plot size. Currently 53x53 ""dashes"".

*Region creator tool

*Emergency Vehicle priority

*Train Station snap-to-road

*A way to deal with ""stuck"" abandoned regions (No bonds

*Improve Advisory intelligence (zoning guy mostly)

*[Game List Sorting] (http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1a2l9n/maxis_give_us_an_option_to_sort_the_game_list_in/)

*More road planning (tolls/road naming/etc)

Update 2.0 Notes

What’s New

* Mayors Mansion: Mayors will now drive their fancy cars to work. Mayor will take their helicopter

* Data maps: Now show in their normal color when a color filter is enabled (unless in a colorblind mode)

* HUD: Now color-corrects when in a colorblind mode.

Fixes and Updates

* Cities not Processing: Mitigates some of the issues that were causing cities not to process. We are continuing to work on and improve this issue.

* Region Filters: Now sorts regions with available cities to the top

* Invitations: Invitations to join a region should be sent and received more quickly.

* Tourism: Fixes for unexplained fluctuation of tourists. Tourists more smartly counted on transit.

* Cruise ships should now be a lot more effective at bringing medium and high wealth tourists in coastal cities.

* New tourists will now decide to come into a city once leaving tourists reach train stations

* This change should reduce the downtime of tourist buildings.

* Casinos: Casinos tuned so that Gambling will be a more profitable specialty. Players must bulldoze and replace existing casinos to see effects of tuning.

* The larger casinos now invite more tourists into the city which helps keep them full.

* Note that existing casinos will need to be replaced to take advantage of this change.

* More Casinos: Raised module limit on Sci-Fi and Sleek Casinos to 6 modules.  

* Region Play: Cash gifts can now be received in a bankrupt city.

* Education: Fixed school buses getting stuck at the high school. Existing Schools will fix themselves.

* Education: Fixed school buses picking up students at neighboring cities that didn’t have school bus stops. 

* Education: Fix to more accurately track regional student population.

* Education: Fix where kids leaving the school bus stop would teleport to the nearest pedestrian path instead of walking directly into the school. 

* Education: University wings now give the proper bonus.

* Recycling: Fix for the Recycling Center where it would sometimes stop working

* Air pollution: Fixed issue where air pollution would appear to come from nowhere. Fix issues where your regional air pollution would be reflected back into your box for a double penalty.  

* Fire Service: Fire Trucks don’t clump

* Water: Water pumps are now capable of pumping water from rivers at a larger radius so they can take better advantage of the water table in a city.

* Disasters:  Some players were getting hit too frequently with random disasters

* Trade: Fix for trade ports that suddenly stop shipping. 

* Transit: Street Cars and Buses go to high volume stops first.

* Transit: A city with residents and public transit will now provide the accurate amount of workers and shoppers to its neighbors.

* Transit: A transit vehicle stuck in a pick-up or drop off loop will now go back to a garage instead of trying to pick up more people.

* Transit vehicles should recover automatically after the update. If players want to force the recovery, then turn them back on. 

* Transit:  Neighbors buses will now come in lower numbers into the city and do a better job at picking up local passengers first. 

* Traffic: Medium density roads now create traffic lights at intersections with other roads and avenues of equal or higher density.

* Residential Tuning: Residential-only cities have failure state.

* Buildings are prevented from going up in density when they don’t have power or water.

* The amount of happiness gained from low taxes, and health outreach has been lowered.

* Fixed some cases where buildings would not go abandoned when they should have.

* Higher density residential buildings are no longer blocked from going abandoned due to not having enough money.

* Happiness from low taxes does not double up every time it is given.

* Losing happiness due to not having a job is more impactful.

* Budgets: Fixed bug with monthly transactions being used to get around systems pushing back.  

* Systems like fire, sewage don’t turn on until you've made a certain amount of money.  Gifts from neighbors are taken into account as well.

* You can no longer create a city that never gets fires, or other pushback issues.

* Income progression (which we use to turn on pushback systems) was not including transactions from gifts

* Income progression should always go up regardless if you have higher expenses. It is the total income that you are bringing in from your city that turns on pushback systems.

* Audio: Fixes issue where audio will stop working after creating a large city or where phantom audio sounds play in a city.

* Demolish: Fixes issue that occurred when players demolished buildings that had service vehicles, the agents would be in a state of limbo and would not recover when new buildings of that type were placed. This will no longer happen.

Because this is our first significant Update, **we’ve concluded 1pm PST is the best window for us to make these improvements**. As you can see from the list above, the wait will be worth it.

1363193349.0,1a82e2,What a Shame... SimCity Ruined,AJm4ck,1106,300,378,"SimCity 2000 was the second game I ever played. I started playing it with my father when I was about 7 or 8 years old. It was the first game I've ever been addicted to.

I watched him lay down zones

It wasn't long before I started playing the game myself, even if half of it was on fire.

Then I was developing my own cities, four years. At my current age, in my mid-twenties, it's hard to remember. But it was the complexity that drew me in.

There were highways, then spending all my money on airport plots, just to watch them stay dormant as my city went bankrupt.

I learned things like traffic management

After SimCity 2000, but that was only because high school got in the way. I still played them and I loved them. They were worthy sequels, to a revolutionary game.

Which brings me to the new ""SimCity"". EA apparently didn't have the heart to name it SimCity 5. Probably because calling that would lead people to assume its a successor to the other games.

It's not a successor. It's a dumbed-down game

What EA and Maxis has delivered here is a game that would be fun on an iPad for an 11-year-old

Regions are some sort of no-mans green plush land. A national park of some kind that is not open to the user of the game. I almost think of the land between cities as EA's space. It represents all the money they refused to give up to make this into a worthy successor. It's what could have been.

That space is where a suburban community could have flourished. Where heritage breed pigs were bred that could later appear on a menu in one of my city's downtown restaurant districts. But no

This game

And now Maxis and EA have gone silent. They have not addressed the real issues at the heart of this game

But now the real questions are coming out and the gaming executives are curling up in their shell.

As a gamer, achievement, or gold coating, that means nothing and is worth nothing, this is the latest slap to my face.

SimCity was the game that tested your mind, commerce, wealth, trade, transportation... but now it's just another stupid social game, that's not social, that's not fun and that's not mentally challenging.

If this is the direction gaming developers are going


*Edit: Thanks for all the love, who has never let me down once in my life. Other than that, thanks for the recommendations on new games I should try. My only hope is that Maxis/ EA fixes this game so we can all enjoy what we expect of a SimCity game - a huge sandbox city game, the best of its kind, capable of being entertaining, educational and (somewhat) realistic in its simulation.*

**Birth**
You are born in ""The Region"".  The Region is a mystical land that can be seen in the distance

**Caste**
When you are born, Shoppers and Kids of the same Wealth class and The Region has you materialize in The City.

**The life of a Shopper**
You are a shopper.  You wake up in your new home, it must be Windsor, but that's a last name... what was it Michael?  Matthew? Maybe it was Francis Windsor. That's right, Francis.  You are the book keeper in this new home, you look in the cupboard and there are nothing but yellow and green cans.  The yellow cans are marked Money, the green cans are marked Happiness.  A sign in scrollwork above the cupboard explains ""Money makes Happiness"".  

It's 6:15, a haunting voice in your head says ""You can buy pizza from the wig store now"". Uneasily you reach into the cupboard and grab one of the yellow cans.  You head down the street to the wig store.  You start to have an irrepressible thought ""Heading to the store before my shift starts!"" ... ""my shift of what?  Will I be going to work later?""  You've heard stories of people who work, but you'd always thought it was just workers that worked.  You get to the door of the wig store and a thought crosses your mind ""There is no food for your baby here.  Go to the gas station"" so you double back, you cross the street and head to the gas station.  

There is nobody filling up at the pumps.  You look around inside, you see a faint teal fluid draining through a hose at the top of the chamber where you've been interred.  You start to forget, all of the things you've learned so far: the story about the Windsor residence, the strange voices, the mishap at the wig store.  Your name, Francis Windsor.  You try to hold on to these things, but they keep slipping away.  You notice a teal can appear on the shelf behind the clerk's desk. 

Who am I? Where am I? The pod opens, a feeling of deja vu washes over you; ""Wasn't I a man?"" you think. But you can't remember, maybe you have been Mary Jacobs all along.  The clerk hands you a green can and sends you on your way.  A faint voice in your head tells you ""You're feeling happy! Head home!""  but where is home?  You start to knock on doors of every house you pass by.  This one is full, that one is full.  This one is empty, you look at the sign on the door, it says Henry Residence.  Maybe that's who you are, a Henry.  You enter the building and look at the cupboard.  There's a sign above it that says ""Money makes Happiness"" and a series of green and yellow cans.  You look at your green can, trying to recall any scrap of your memory.  You come up blank.  Maybe I was Frances


**The Life of a Worker**

You awaken.  It's 8:00 AM.  You are not a morning person. You have lost any semblance of an identity long ago.  You've been asked to be so many things so many times that you don't know if any of them were ever really true. You look around

You get a call, good Morning Richard."" Finally, she looks relieved.  

You both walk to the kitchen for breakfast, today I'm just going to look for work."" 

""Don't you get tired of this?"" you ask.  ""Yes, forever."" She says.  ""I just want to stop, you're beautiful Mary.  I want to just stop... with you.  I don't care if we get boarded up and disappear, I'd rather live a single day certain of who I am, what I'm doing, and then never again than live in perpetuity under a different roof with a different wife.  I just want to be me, and I want to be with you.""

""Oh Richard.  I want the same thing, I just can't control my body, I have to leave!  I will come back for you Richard, I promise!"".  You get another text on your phone telling you that you really need to come to work.  You know what happens when you come to work though, it happens every time.  Once you enter the workplace, people will fill up your house, it's gotten to the point that you don't even bother trying to return, and a giant traffic jam develops.  There is another avenue that you could have taken

Unable to resist you walk to the door -- full, you try to head to that one but you're unable to resist crossing the street, you see the factor and people are walking into it, there are jobs available.  This must be the one the boss was telling you about.  You look at your watch, only a few more minutes.  You get to the edge of the property and you get a call.  ""It's the boss, I don't know what you're trying to pull here.  Don't bother coming in today, you're too slow.  Next time think about your priorities.  I can make you disappear"".  Elated, you remember your name, open a beer and watch TV

6:30 PM, ""Evelyn... I think. Evelyn Jacobs."" Damnit, they got to her. Could this still be her? Maybe it is. ""Well Evelyn, today you're a Windsor.  I'm Richard."" you explain.  ""Oh Richard, I'm tired of working at the factory."" she says, handing you three yellow cans - but she doesn't sound just physically tired, she sounds completely drained.

Period.

They don't want your 'vision' or 'ideas'

Why ""design the game with multiplayer in mind"" when simcity has NEVER been multiplayer?  You knew that this would conflict with the history of this franchise and the fans.  Why make it ONLY multiplayer and *force* everyone that has played simcity to play multiplayer?

Sure, but only if it is OPTIONAL.

You have ignored your players' voices from day 1 about offline mode when this was the single most wanted thing to not happen.  You release an unfinished game without it being tested fully

You need to LISTEN to your fans


There are a few things that can be done though

* Make an offline mode *optional*.  Those that want to play with friends and fulfill your 'vision' will still be able to.

* Make modding acceptable and available.  People that don't work for you guys are making this game more enjoyable and fun.  They are fixing what is broken.  You respond to this by patches

* Make refunds readily available to those who request them.

* Admit that you lied to us about the ability for the game to run offline.

The credit of the idea goes to anickle
http://forum.ea.com/eaforum/posts/list/9359265.page 


My experiment: 


I started sandbox mode and built water


I built one single house


One single house, 2 shoppers and actually 2 kids that are never included in the population count. So it is safe to assume that from now on, provided sims don’t die, my workers count and my shoppers count will always be: “no. of houses x 4” (workers) or “no. of houses x 2” (shoppers). 


I kept building more houses and recording the increase in the numbers of workers and shoppers. As expected, and he is absolutely right. 


This is the count of the population and the number of workers and shoppers so far: 


1 house = 6 pop
12 houses = 72 pop
53 houses = 318 pop
83 houses = 498 pop


And here it goes the odd part: as the next house was finished, the population count increased by 10, and at the next time it increased by 12. 


BUT THE HOUSES CONTINUED WITH 6 PEOPLE (4W+2S). 


So indeed


House 1
House 2: 10; 
House 3: 12; 
House 4: 13; 
(...) 


I kept counting this for 41 houses


7, 13, 14, 14, 15, 15, 15, 17, 18, 19


The final house count was at 121 and the population was at 1.294, they increase both real and ghost sims in our cities. 


I stopped counting there as I though I already had the general idea, without ever adding these sims in your actual city. 


This is alarming, but that is not so true as I will continue below. 


Besides the experiment above


1. If you demolish a bulding that provides jobs, this worker is deleted along with the building. I managed to intentionally have a city with no workers by doing this. Note that I 
did it when I only had 2 houses


2. After I closed the police, chances are you will lose many workers there. 


3. The game does not know how to behave when sims die: If one sim die both the pop count and the workforce go down by 1 (so far so good), meaning that you actually lose 7 sims, not 6. 


4. Even if you only have 1 single house in the map, although (usually) maintaining their names, used different “sprites”/models each time, with no consistency at all. There was no connection with the names and “surname” of the house. The only rule was that sims that leave the house for working always had the same surname as the house. That means the sims are not “real” agents, they are randomly generated each time, with different names and models every time, provided they are not going to work. 


5. Numbers I gathered for you guys while playing: 


Commercial: 5/10L, I guess different buildings have different job slots. There may be more); Industrial: 20L, 6M, 0H (Again, there may be others); Wind Power Plant jobs: 20L, 6M, 0H; Sewage facility: 0L, 0H; Garbage dump: 20L, 0H; Fire Dept: 20L
Clinic: 12L

So

However, tons of population, loads of money and income, no unemployment, excess services, etc....there's simply nothing left to do unless I start rebuilding sections of the city just for the sake of doing it.  

The only remaining thing to do is to move on and build more cities in the region

SimCity is a sandbox game, truly limits creativity.

After making a successful city in the older games, things to tinker with, extra ways to bring in needed income to expand, etc.  In SimCity 2013, after you make a successful city, you're simply out of space unless you want to start demolishing entire blocks of zoning.  Loads of excess income sits around with nothing to spend it on, etc.  Once cheetah speed is re-added

I don't want to recycle through common game suggestions, there just aren't many challenging aspects of the game once you get a grasp of the mechanics.  Income-generation is really unbalanced, and it's possible to make millions of simoleons in just a day or two of play.  Regional play is a fantastic concept, but it's either broken or unreliably random in its functionality.  I think all of this comes together and turns an otherwise great game into something very shallow and very limited.

But I've seen very little that resonates with me on a whole host of other game quandaries. So here goes in no particular order:

* **Land value** - high desirability should *not* just be triggered by parks and civic buildings. I want elements of the landscape itself

* **Ground textures** - Ploppable objects, deep green. Undeveloped land has a hue of a much brighter green (or brown). Why the fuck? They look stupid next to each other.

* **Property shape/no autofill** - Ungainly wedges form when placing anything on an angle or a curve. These inscribed spaces yield unusable land, allow an auto-fill with generic objects or parklands to bring cohesion to these odd spaces.

* **Player/Regional Accountability** - the ability to grief a region by bankrupting cities or mess with other players by polluting upwind is just not good. To avoid abuse, region players will have the opportunity to rate and assess fairness/decency of others. Griefers will be picked out quickly, and those with low ratings will only be permitted to join ""low rated"" region games. Ratings will not be irredeemable. 

* **Resource scarcity** - this is the most instantly fixable thing I can think of. Ore shortages might make a bit of sense in a ""fuck you, some mines have been in operation for thousands of years in reality). Water supply diminishment is the worst example of this scarcity, it is entirely ridiculous and will ultimately doom a city. **Edit: this can be alleviated by placing a pump near a sewage treatment plant** (thanks: tyren22, vondruke00) But it is also mentioned that the treated outflow goes back into the water table (rather than the pipes, which makes little sense), you have to ensure it remains clean, and it is my contention that the ground water should not vanish so quickly, introducing scarcity when you have unfinished or crippled modes of production

* **Statistics availability** - how many people are on that bus? (**Correction: This stat is in-game** thanks

* **Non-dispatchable emergency services** - I want the option to flag emergencies for police/fire/rescue vehicles. 

* **Unrealistic development rates** - If the density of my city would not sustain or justify a skyscraper, why are commercial structures appearing at all if the demand for them is zero?

* **Lack of useful, like the original Maxis did? How about this: **1.** Traffic woes? If you have a university with the superconductor upgrade, you can research the flying cars project. Or - **2.** Ground pollution, you need the recycling center's de-soiler poo-poo repurposer. Cleans up surface muck and produces great fertilizer for your local farms *(by the way, farms)*. **3.** Labor shortages? Play bad mayor and gain a little ""ostensibly-legitimate help"" in the form of a stream of overseas workers. Play good mayor and research the robotic assembly line project. Why should the game stick us with challenges and no way to address them?

* **No ordinances/edicts** - I want to initiate public policies with real trade-offs in the form of virtues vs. consequences. Recycling mandate: Citizens are required to sort their garbage into llama-proof recycling bins (bins themselves non-recyclable). Approval -%2; garbage yielded -15%. Or, +0.5% residential tax income) then let it be a reward to mayors... instead of getting gifted with do-nothing microsoft-style achievements that no one cares about. 

* **Modifiable service and civic buildings -- that fundamentally look the same** - I want to see new skins. Variants, so as to make them potentially taller. Wider. As is, the city hall moddability is pretty cool, as well as the elementary school's.

* **Working educational system** - High schools and elementary schools should be required. Their coverage would then affect a drop-out vs high school graduate metric. Can't afford them? You're going to have a shitty-ass set of schools with shitty-ass students. Think institutional shack-and-brick where you rape student families for hot lunches and prom tickets. As to Colleges and Universities - their placement would impact the percentage of higher-ed graduates (obviously) which would have a direct effect on industry type, we should have the ability to set *tuition and fees* which would also affect graduation rates. (Too expensive, fewer graduates.) Again, statistics.

* **Road-laying difficulties** (thanks: Hirathian) - Draw roads around a building imperfectly -- and prepare for weirdness in the form of giant odd loops, it's annoying. Roads should snap to structures as they do grids, and make it easy to continue in a 90 degree manner around buildings. Cross-roads are also tirelessly fussy when it comes to forming intersections if the existing road-ends aren't perfectly aligned. Or they intersect at bad angles. Solution - Roads should have a ""snap-to"" key, such as shift, which communicates the will of the player for ""straightness"" which conforms to the shape of structures and which would also fill in any gaps from roads you intend to intersect that happen to fall a bit short. Supplemental solution: ""ghost roads"" - test your layout before you commit to payment. Sort of like masking in photoshop.

* **Dynamic city changes only partially implemented** - Noticing the solar panels appearing on some structures within ""green"" cities, etc. etc.? Are the solar panels really it? What happened to the rest of it? How about changes to roads, signs, or anything else that might convey an identity to the work you've done?

Check out [this](http://forum.ea.com/eaforum/posts/list/9359265.page) thread from the Sim City forums. In particular this post:

&gt;A Low Income - Low Density House has 6 adults
If you destroy this home

&gt;A Low Income - Med Density House has 60 adults
If you destroy this home

&gt;A Low Income - High Density House is where things go all whacky... By the pattern above you would assume that a high density home would be 600 adults where 400 are workers and 200 are shoppers

&gt;BUT... 

&gt;If you destroy this High Density house

&gt;So either the worker/shopper count is bugged for high population buildings

So what the hell? This basically confirms a lot of suspicions of mine and others that we aren't actually seeing that many sims in our cities and it also explains why only 1/10 of the population is working. We don't actually have as many people in our cities as we think! EA has stated numerous times that their internal testers were able to get cities of 500k and even 1 million sims

I assume Maxis had actually accounted for the fact people wanted to mod the game and made it seemingly easy to do from the get go. I assume they are waiting a bit until after launch to officially release tools. 

This is a very basic guide to get people who have experience in modding started. I will show you how to create a very very simple population mod to show the real values - I do not currently know if this will adjust the AI at all (I doubt it). I am unsure of the current capabilities of this but have succesfully loaded some custom javascript into the game UI etc and would like others to help explore the possibilities.

What you need to begin with:

Some Javascript knowledge.

[SimCityPak](http://community.simtropolis.com/topic/53278-simcitypak-modding-tool/)

[s3pe Development Release](http://www.den.simlogical.com/denforum/index.php?topic=1808.0)

A text editor (Preferably Sublime Text 2) - Notepad will work but will be a pain in the fucking arse. 

**What we do with SimCityPak**

We will use SimCityPak as our general .package file viewer

Open up SCP and navigate to the install folder of Sim City from the open file dialog. Go into the SimCityData folder - this is where most of the assets are located. Most of the files are named appropiately but the one we will be looking at is ""SimCity_Game.package"". Open that up. On the left hand side it lists all the files in the package. Have a look around and try to find interesting files. The most interesting ones are usually large in file size and are type JSON or Javascript. 

This is general information by the way and not entirely related to the basic visual mod we are going to do - its just to show you how to navigate the files for yourself. You are safe to close SimCityPak.


**On to the actual mod**

Load up S3PE and open ""SimCity_Game.package"". CLOSE ALL INSTANCES OF SIM CITY. The file we want is JSON in the TAG column and is large in file size. So click the headings at the top to sort by Filesize. As this is a generic tutorial I cant specifically say what its reference is as I have to assume it changes from patch to patch. The file we are looking for is a huge compressed javascript file which likely starts with: 

&gt; 'use strict'; var COMPILED = !0

Here is a screenshot of the uncompressed code (Sorry only copy I have): http://i.imgur.com/hG7cy44.png

Now export that by rightclicking the line in the table and clicking Export. Load it into your text editor and if it has syntax highlighting either turn it off or change it to javascript.

To make the code at all readable I recommend you plop it into http://jsbeautifier.org/ (making sure you turn off the fancy text box or prepare for mass lag).

And replace the code on there with your code. 

Now you have 100% editable UI/Whatever else is in there code. For this quick tutorial we are going to find the line that starts with

&gt; simcity.GetFudgedPopulation() = function


I assume you know how to edit javascript so it should be self explanitory but two lines after put 

&gt; return a;

Save the file

If you did it correctly your cities and I guess other peoples cities should now be showing the *actual* population


**Wrapping up**

As I said this is a generic ""off the press"" sort of tutorial not designed to do anything other than show people how it can be done on a very basic scale and see what other people can come up with with more time.

1364151641.0,1axcpx,I am a very patient person but this game has broken me.,djcrs1,750,149,224,"So here is the experience that finally convinced me to give up on this terrible game:

I experimented with various city layouts and economies for well over 100 hours. I also read this and other forums and watched many youtube videos to learn about shortcuts and problems from others. As someone with programming and server cluster experience

After trashing many cities

I started an oil-fuel city to support my region

I then began diverting my exports to the great work International Airport. I had not yet completed this one before. My plan was to support my region by tourism and gambling since my natural resources were running out. I have gone down the long boring path of consumer electronics before and I found it to be a trade port micro and tree planting simulator in the long run.

I began to export the natural resources oil

Now I began spending some time in my tourist cities to prepare for the onslaught of tourists! I noticed the international airport closed then repoened a few times due to criminals?! I had sent plently of services there so I just gave it a few days to stabilize. Finally my big airport was up and running for three days uninterrupted. Time to check the stats!

Now before the International Airport

OK keep a positive attitude. I already have lots of tourists. The airport is just cosmetic and part of the ""immersion"" then. No problem. Let's start figuring out how to maximize these tourist towns so they can support the region.

On a sidenote

But I digress.

I remembered to place down my casinos near to the event centers and landmarks in the center of the map so that the entering and exiting tourists would be drawn in. Upon watching more closely

Ok fine. I demolish two city blocks of prime residential 3/3 real estate so I can place a new big casino directly on the one exit path the sims use to leave the one particular event center I was looking at. I realized I would need to do the same for the areas around my other event centers and cities also.

I wait for the next event to exit... all the sims hit the streets... and proceed to walk right past my shiny new casino because it is not on their side of the street! So they won't visit my casino unless I place it not only directly on their exiting street

So do I demolish my nice Empire State Building to adapt to this new information??? No! For the first (and likely last) time I just immediately exit the game. I truly give up unless Maxis makes drastic changes to this terrible broken game. What kind of ""freedom of city design"" do I really have when I am so restricted by these programmed behaviors that there is only one location to make my casino profitable. While I have not yet lost any cities due to server errors

Yes I can reorganize my cities so all the tourist entrance and exit paths lead right by a casino

I like a challenge. I play Starcraft 2 ladder. My Skyrim has over 200 mods. I am starting to play SimCity 4 now (although I feel dirty giving Maxis any more money). But this game is no challenge and offers no freedom. It is an exercise in futility at its core. I refuse to play it again in its current state: not out of principle

I understand that you have put work into the game, the tiny map sizes, the broken agent system, and so on. Looking at that broken mess, many of us are able to see the magnificent game it was supposed to be, which makes it even harder to bear with it now.

Same goes for ""the big patch"". I really believe you wanted to fix whats broken, you probably wouldn't be a game developer in the first place if this was not your intention, but I kind of think EA is not letting you put as much manpower to work as you might need. 


As a guy who played the original Sim City on an Atri, I even let my SNES run over night, secretly, so my parents wouldn't notice that damn bright red light during the night, just so the next day I have enough money to build a huge city. The first game I played on my computer was Sim City 2000, I just loved it. Same goes for 3000 and 4, both which I played religiously. It is hard to count the time I played this game in hours

Upon initial inspection, and sure enough, that got things slightly working. It then became obvious that there were more issues that were arising due to differences between Windows 95, which the game had been programmed for, and the NT line of Windows. The client was running 3 threads at full tilt, maxing out 3 cores of my CPU, and the server was doing the same with 1 thread. I simply added in some clumsy sleeps to fix the maxed out threads. I then did a slightly more proper job of clobbering the mutex and semaphore scheme in use and let the game just rely on TCP/IP even for a local client; a side benefit is you can now run multiple clients on one computer, so I fixed those up too. I used an XP SP2+ feature called registration-free COM to get the game's newspaper and help utility functioning again (though only owners of the full retail game benefit from this; the trial version just uses the newspaper and help utility as advertisements).

I then made some usability improvements so that the game was more bearable to play

Run the server first, select Join Game, and connect to yourself (127.0.0.1). Be sure to enter a name (if left blank, the server will reject you saying the name is already in use).

When you first start, zone industrial and residential within 3 squares of the road, and make sure to run power lines.

Don't forget that most power plants have a lifespan of 50 years.

Turtle speed is 1 month per 30 seconds, and african swallow seems to be 1 month per ~6 seconds. I'd recommend cheetah or african swallow.

Good luck keeping your finances in the black on your first few tries; this game can be hard.

Patch 2.0 didnt try to fix it. Patch 3.0 didn't try to fix it. How long are we going to wait before this basic major feature of the game is even functional? How is it possible for it to have released this broken? It *does not work*. Testers didn't realize that? Programmers didn't realize that?

How long is it going to be?

Didn't a big guy in your company just the other day do an interview where he acknowledged small city sizes being a huge complaint

Well, you're doing a terrible job, and he's doing a terrible job for your publicity by going out and saying that it solves problems, when **it** is a problem. It **does not work.** At all. And he's out advertising it as a means to get over or around the small city sizes.

 Here's what I said-

&gt;Stuff like fire trucks, water, sewage services being unavailable for minutes or even real world hours before the game finally recognizes that other cities are providing them is a very common thing. And of course great work contributions/great works in general. Start one in one city and other cities show an empty great work plot. Finish one in that first city and other cities show they're incomplete (and still send resources to them, losing those resources forever).

# They choose which direction to go at an intersection at random.
# They reverse direction somewhat arbitrarily after picking people up.  We suspect it's because of where the passengers want to go.

They don't know where they are going, randomly choose a direction if presented with a choice, and flip the other way periodically after picking people up.

I had rather foolishly put street car intersections (mostly T intersections) into my city so the light rail could get where it needed to go, not picked up.

The key to light rail is ZERO intersections.  The street cars need to only be able to go 1 way

With no intersections

Edit: After more analysis (clicking on the car shows how many are on it, they flip for other reasons I've yet to determine.  Without the intersections they do spread out nicely and none of my stops have many people in them, and no street car is carrying &gt; 100 people, but now I am not sure why they flip.

What we know:

* The SimCity servers are [hosted on Amazon EC2](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/19vsat/curious_about_the_simcity_server_status_i_made/c8rsfkv).

* The ops team have, EU East 3 and Oceanic 2 (sidenote: I would be mildly amused if they got to the point of having an Oceanic 6).

* Very little data is shared between servers

* A major issue in the day(s) following launch was [database replication lag](https://twitter.com/derricks/status/309282958668341248).

This means that each 'server' is almost certainly in reality a cluster of EC2 nodes, which performs the change and transmits it to its slaves.  Reads (getting data) are distributed across the slaves.

* The client appears to be able to simulate a city while disconnected from the servers.  I've experienced this myself

* Trades and other region sharing functionality often appears to be delayed and/or broken.

* While connected

* The servers implement some form of client action validation, choosing to accept them or force a rollback if it rejects them.

So the servers are responsible for:

1. Simulating the region
2. Handling inter-city trading
3. Validating individual client actions
4. Managing the leaderboards
5. Maintaining the global market
6. Handling other sundry social elements

The admins have disabled leaderboards.  More tellingly

What interests me is that the admins have been adding capacity

That in itself suggests that each cluster has a single, is causing too many writes for a single master to handle.  I worry that this could be a core limitation of the architecture, one which may take weeks to overcome with a complete and satisfactory fix.

Such a fix could be:

* Alter the database setup to a multi-master one

* Disable server validation

* Greatly reduce the processing and/or data overhead for server validation (and possibly region simulation).  May not be possible; may be possible but a big undertaking; may be a relatively small undertaking if a small area of functionality is causing the majority of the overhead.

Edit: I just want to add something I said in a comment: Of course it is still entirely possible that the solution to the bottleneck is relatively minor.  Perhaps slaves are just running out of RAM, or there're too many indexes.

It could just be a hard to diagnose issue

**Fix Suggestions:**

*u\binaryrage's suggestion for traffic: (Note: I don't know if it'll work for all the bigger cities)*

* On traffic - use high density roads back one intersection. It'll add traffic lights and avoid the worst of the flareups. I have a 60K city with almost no traffic and the only transport I have is street cars down one main avenue.

*u\Hive_64 suggestion for random crashes:*

* If you get the random crash and loss of progress, disable origin in-game). Next, restart your client. I kept crashing every ~20 minutes when I would start a game and this fixed it for me.

**Launch Issues:**

* Unable to see Origin friends in game
* Keep being forced to complete tutorial
* Servers being full
* Second city keep crashing
* Cities desyncing
* Cities disappearing entirely from the region
* Clock disappeared
* Changing speeds no longer worked 
* Random crash
* Trades don't occur properly between cities
* In game chat doesn't work. Region invitations don't show up in game
* All options for the in game menu don't load.
* Origin only downloads about 286 MBs worth of data


*u\shadowclaimer's crashes:*

* Crash 1 - City claimed, 3 other cities + International Airport in works (Reproduced in Crash 2)
* Crash 2 - City claimed, 3 other cities + International Airport in works
* Crash 3 - Opened recyclables map in city with tons of recyclables.
* Crash 4 - Placed School of Business
* Crash 5 - Random Crash
* Crash 6 - Crash 1/2 similar, all of them crashed.


**Game Bugs:**

* No Railroad - Discovery Delta has a city with no railroad connection but a railroad that stops at a bridge (the Island City)
* City to city trades are late
* AI services (firetrucks
* Cars driving in circles with no reason
* Service cars (police, etc.) distribution seems off, they often drive in a pack which decreases the overall range
* AI always takes the shortest route
* Accidents aren't handled properly by emergency services
* Unable to build ploppables on top of fences
* Great works do not update resource count until all players in the region exit.
* Additions to Great Hall do not translate over to the entire region. Build a department of transportation
* Not enough rain to refill water supply

*u\shadowclaimer's minor bug reportings:*

* Recycling Center - Metal Reclaimation Lines are too wide
* Road Connections - Are broken whenever elevation is involved

* Traffic - Has something wrong with it, each with different road layouts/road density/avenue-no avenue bits, I hit massive massive traffic backup.s Huge bus networks, trains, planes, etc. did NOT help.
* Magical Criminals - Loaded my city, they're all gone. Whether intentional/a bug or not, its absolutely absurd.

*u\macellan's minor bug reportings:*

* Traffic seriously fubar. Locked intersections
* $ Sims not using mass transit
* International/cultural digital deluxe set not changing buildings to look like target country.
* Can't claim cities in my own private zone.
* Streetcars wander, completely ignore another. Riders/day bugs at a number and never changes.
* Road bugs when starting a city
* Mass transit keeps getting stuck at one number. Population dropped from 220k to 32k and 7687 riders for buses

**Graphical Issues:**

* The roads disappear at certain zoom levels
* Roads underwater
* Driveways connecting to roads vertically
* Buildings on avenues
* Ploppables not graphically connecting to roads properly (eg: Tram depot)
* Buildings on top of other buildings
* Viridian Hills Region

First off to anyone to anyone saying ""where's the proof"" I simply have to ask... are you serious? I'm not trying to tell anyone I saw Bigfoot or discovered free energy! I'm talking about problems in a game that has been discussed at length

Second, where before it ran for I believe 6, so here's hoping nothing happens. 

I will say this. Overall, and realistically with the AlwaysOn, city size and DLC schemes, I don't know that it ever will be, but at least it's getting better. That being said, the original post here was made because you can only grin and bear a succession of fuck ups for so long and today I hit my limit, and wanted feedback to my situation directly.

Dumb pathfinding, making any chances of balancing the RCI a pipe dream.

The trade economy is broken, inter-regional cooperation becomes a bigger problem because of the one and only chokepoint they supply to you per plot.

Who is EA/Maxis trying to fool here? Probably 8 out of 10 Simcity players love maths, which pisses me off the most. The longer you play, the worse the game is, with fault after fault slowly but surely becoming glaring issues that forces players to play the game in one true way; **no high density structures, roads are constricted to optimal layouts, and a huge focus on export.**

While 'deep' simulation is relative, and taken advantage of by EA/Maxis. Yet I remain hopelessly optimistic that Maxis would fix these balance issues. I expected the server problems, but not the broken game within.

Till then

tl;dr: the very demographic that wants to play Simcity finds this Simcity to be shallow

I was excited to get the new installment of SimCity



I bought the latest SimCity the day after its release, and they are completely unacceptable. The last straw for me was seeing my cities simply disappear, without any way to get them back. Had they been saved to my computer, I would still have access to them. I tried so hard to enjoy this game, I didn't want to believe that it was awful, but it is, it really is, I had to get my money back from Maxis.



I opened a chat via Origin, as I was not able to actually use the game as it was designed. The origin chat rep said no refunds were available, he escalated my case after I pushed a little, and gave me a case number. I called in, waited on hold for 30 minutes and spoke to a ""Game Advisor."" I re-explained the situation, and was told that there would be no refund. 



Leaving me with no choice, they did so, and the charge was removed from my bill immediately, **the call took 4 minutes**. Others on this subreddit have pointed out that my origin account will be banned for doing this, thats fine, because SimCity is the only game in my Origin account, as I said



I am completely appalled at the behavior that EA has displayed toward their customers. We have been tossed aside as nothing more than statistics, but more for those who are entering the world of video gaming now, this is their status quo. Abysmal customer support, outright lies, poor quality products, and invasive DRM, this is what a new gamer is greeted with today, it was called ""SpyWare"" back then.



The moral of the story is, and it's the only way that we can tell them this is not the direction that we want the video game industry to take.



EA will never see another penny from me, they simply tossed me aside -- ""Nothing we can do."" That's fine EA, there may be nothing you can do, but there's certainly something that your customers can do, and I hope you start to feel it.



TL;DR: I was really looking forward to the new Command &amp; Conquer

However now I'm growing increasingly bored with the game. It's come to the point where I feel as if I've accomplished all that I can. I feel as if I've 'beaten' the game so to speak

SimCity 5 had a lot of features removed, achieved success with all the city specializations, and experimented with cities of all different wealth and zone types. Now it feels as if my cities all end up being clones of one another and the only thing to tinker with is the road layout.

I think this feeling of unfulfillment comes from two things, it's time to move on to the next plot and repeat the process. The second thing that creates this sense of unfulfillment is how the game really limits how creative we can be. In SC4, modding combined with massive regions meant you could literally have multiple plots that didn`t have any identical buildings and so on. I'm sure in the future there will be DLC content with larger city sizes, new building sets and specializations. And sure it will be fun for a while to try these out and make a few more cities. However ultimately the questions still remains:

And then what?

However to me the thing that is riling people up the most is blatant lying to placate/deceive/deflect.  Unfortunately for EA/Maxis there are a lot of very smart cookies in this community who shone beacons of truth at this bullshit.  For people new to this the biggest lies are:

* LIE 1) Offline mode cannot be enabled. 
This took less than a week to be proved false and was published as such in many distinguised media sources such as [BBC NEWS](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21802508)

* LIE 2) Quote from Maxis ""The bugs at launch are the result of the impossibility of testing every possible outcome.""
Anyone that builds a city for 3 or 4(takes longer as no Cheetah) hours or more will find numerous bugs/broken mechanics. In fact I would challenge the Maxis QA team to stream the build of a city for 3-4 hours without encountering gamebreaking bugs. It is just not possible.  Therefore they must have known about these game breaking problems and launched a broken product deceiving a million customers who assumed they had a working product

* LIE 3) Quote from Maxis  ""Customers wanted an always online (MMO) experience""
I think every reasonable customer would like the opportunity to play multiplayer however very very few want it forced on them when it results in such a limited game play experience e.g. no load from a saved game or microscopic cities compared to previous versions'. Basically latest versions should not offer less functionality than their predecessor

* LIE 4 Everything is simulated. 
The clever cookies soon put pay to this lie by uncovering how vacuous the 'sims' are and that sim numbers after a certain point are inflated and not actually part of the simulation.

What other lies from EA/Maxis have I missed?

I regret ever buying the game in the first place. Getting SC for my wife and I cost $125 total from Origin. The whole time I was thinking to myself, just wait and see"". I convinced myself to do it for the limited edition ""Only pre-order"" pack. Needless to say I was dissapointed that they used that as a marketing tool to trick you into buying the game early. They later extended it anyway. Hell, you can still get it on their site right now.

Anyway, but this PR non-sense is intolerable. They are acting like the game is actually working perfectly even weeks after launch, and that's horse-shit. Even on simcity.com they are praising their 10/10 reviews. It's the dishonesty at this point that bothers me.

Anyway so the point of this, ""Normally we do a dispute process, where we get in touch with the merchant, but for this merchant we just do a straight charge-back"". That was it.

So clearly EA has gotten so many charge-backs at this point due to this release

1363186751.0,1a7uhp,Five Quick Fixes that would almost entirely solve traffic and simulation problems ,WeLoveKanjimari,315,59,171,"1. Allow service vehicles free reign of the road

2. When a service vehicle is called somewhere, do not *allow* another to try to get there, too. 

3. While sims are at work

4. Simulated population needs to be consistent. Right now, we can see the sims and cars moving about, but if literally every single one was simulated, the game would be unplayable due to traffic. **The problem comes from high density populations**- they're not multiplied by the same factor as the others (one sim is equivalent to 16, IIRC), and it causes problems with every other aspect of simulation. (for example, double population =/= double tax profit

5. Modify the happiness system. Do not allow happiness to increase dramatically as long as a sim comes home with more money than they started with, and thus have an excess every single day). Something here is just busted. Instead, happiness should focus on land value, proximity to services, education value, etc. No more ""High wealth as long as a statue garden is nearby"", high wealth homes should only appear if the things they demand **after** moving in are there **beforehand**. 

I played SimCity 4 for years. I don't know if it's just easier to understand what is going wrong in this version, population growth and happiness is so out of control that I got one the first day I played. Was it exciting? Hell yes. Did I feel accomplished? Of course! But it happened too fast. I should need 3 cities of crappy buildings before a fourth feels comfortable enough growing like that, and then the others can catch up.

Patch 1.2

* Fix for crash caused most commonly occurring on servers experiencing lag. This crash would happen most often when claiming a new city when playing in a region.
* Fix for server select dialog not appearing on start-up if the server the player was last on is not available.
* Disabled Cheetah speed. Cheetah speed is is now the same as llama speed.

1358624891.0,16w1p6,My thoughts on SimCity so far,iomex,278,33,306,"I've done about 15 hours in the Dev Beta now and thought I'd share my feelings so far.

The game really is great - it does feel like a good quality product

**TRANSPORT**
Laying roads feels very similar to CXL - except Maxis has done a better job. Being able to draw even curves

The traffic data view is a little more natural, in SC, you only see what's happening right now. So, if you want to see how your main avenue is doing at rush hour, you'll have to wait for rush hour.

Bus termini are an excellent touch, so you can add more garages to increase the size of your fleet.

Unfortunately, and no highways (that you can build, anyway). Also, I was disappointed to see that buses are used in the same way as SC4, in that you place bus stops and buses travel between them autonomously (with the exception you must now have bus depots/termini). Also, buses appear to be free to board (although I might be mistaken here).

**CIVIC AMENITIES**
Police stations, etc are all implemented excellently. Basic stations can first be built, which gives you the building and a fleet of 1 or 2 vehicles. Additional facilities (such as patient wards or prison cells) can be added later using the excellent modules system.

The operation of these systems is equally excellent. Sick people will drive to the hospitals, those injured people can die waiting for an ambulance. Sims will stay in the hospital for some time then will be released. Policemen sims will patrol the streets, and actively pursue criminals who will be detained in the police station for a set time. What I particularly like here, is how sims are criminals - crime isn't committed randomly, people with criminal tendencies start with petty crime and will escalate to things like murder. With fire, crews respond by themselves when a fire starts. They respond in much the same way as before - but the whole package feels a lot more convincing this time round. I particularly like watching emergency vehicles negotiate city traffic, and how cars will go around parked ambulances/police cars/fire trucks.

Adding the relevant department to your city hall will give you more options for upgrades and buildings. (While we are on the subject

There is little to say against the game in this respect really. It all works as you'd expect it to.

**UTILITIES**
This is one of my favourite parts of the game. All utilities are handled by roads - no laying pipes or power lines. Dealing with sewage is a new and interesting aspect to the game. I enjoyed listening to the gross sounds the sewage outlet pipe made when I first placed one.

Waste collection has been improved immeasurably in this new release. You place a city dump (which you can expand), you will see the trash level at each property lower as a garbage truck visits. Once their rounds are complete, the trucks return to the dump to offload the garbage and await the next collection round. This system is absolutely excellent and very rewarding when you've got a well managed system.

Water and power work as very similar systems. You place a source at the best location (a windy hilltop for a wind power station, and the power/water is distributed along the road network. Consumers are served on a first-come-first-served basis, so homes and businesses closest to the stations have the most reliable supply. When demand outstrips supply, those at the furthest reaches of the network are the first to lose their supply. The supply recedes along the road network, until capacity is increased. You can add further wind turbines to your wind plant, for example - or secure a supply from another city in the region (as you can also do with police, ambulances, garbage collection and other services).

Again

**STABILITY**
Not so good here, and I am returned to the main menu. When this happens, the game must be rebooted or the game will hang at the loading screen when trying to boot a different city.

I've had one crash to desktop error

There are still a number of graphical glitches throughout the game

**LOOK AND FEEL**
Feels a little strange at first

Once you have become accustomed to the game, or you can play the game to its full potential and run a city to its full potential - so its accessible and engaging at the same time.

I particularly like how you can zoom into region view on the fly, and instantly zoom back into your current city.

However, and 15fps on high settings (in developed cities). I think it should be up to the player how large his city should be. For example - I avoid large cities in CXL due to performance issues.

This aside, too. I can't say too much about tilt shift as I've set it to minimum.

The music really ties it all together - you already know about this system but it really does feel better in the flesh.

**MULTIPLAYER**
I've not played about with this yet, just abandon it and start afresh.

Just as long as there isn't a network issue - which could be a problem in the future. I hope that there is an API or something so people can host their own SimCity servers if/when EA can't be bothered to anymore.",self,t5_2ryr3,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/16w1p6/my_thoughts_on_simcity_so_far/

Since no one replied, so

In the beta for the new SimCity

Using [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/I1iJazRh.jpg) as a guide
So, the building seems twice as deep as it is wide, so I assigned the depth to 111.54 feet.  This gives us the square footage of a single story as 6220.58.  I multiplied that by 4 (the last story is smaller, but I did not include the garage in my original width measurement, so I'm fudging a bit here) which gives us a total square footage of 24,882.
According to [this website](http://www.reedconstructiondata.com/rsmeans/models/police/) to build a police station with a brick facade (like we see in the screenshot) costs (using union labor) $181.97/sqft, so let's round that up to $4.6 million.  That means that 1 Simoleon is approx. equal to **$153.33**.

But what about my original question of the galleon to simoleon conversion?  According to [this website](http://www.hp-lexicon.org/wizworld/galleons.html) 1 galleon is worth $10.07 so 1 simoleon ~= 15 galleons.

Perhaps like others, vibrant, challenging, expansive, beautiful, creative and exciting. The kind of thing you'd leave on your second monitor to watch a little ecosystem grow while you work and at night, tinker with it and build a little more.

In those missing years I really did not know that a vibrant community sprang up and genuinely supported and grew SC4 into a masterpiece. I just never really bothered to check in on it. I didn't even know it was modifyable. 

Slowly it all came back to me - as if SC5 was the predecessor and SC4 was the new SimCity. Expansive city sizes, highways and infrastructure were just the beginning.

Then I went out and installed NAM

In short - thank you EA. I would have never taken the time to find SC4 if it weren't for SC5.

I remember when I used to play the older SimCities. You started out with this huge sandbox. You had months and months ahead of you to build a huge metropolis. The vastness of it was mesmerizing. 

You got to plan ahead and make clever decisions on macro and micro level. If something didn't work as planned

I remember thinking ""I should be a city planner! I am really good at this!""

With the new SimCity I get a feeling of ""I can fill the entire city space in half an hour"". It's not a grand building project. And because of weird traffic/agent behavior you don't feel it is *your* accomplishment if the city works

In the old SimCities, analyzed the traffic patterns, and made an adjustment. The feeling of seeing things clear up. THAT is what created the good experiences. In the new SimCity, you see a problem, you try to fix it. It may work, or it might send 20 fire trucks to the same fire while the rest of your city burns down. Either way, I don't feel responsible for the outcome of my development.

I guess the feeling I'm longing could be fixed if the agent logic was fixed, I didn't feel it. I returned the game, hoping to see some fixes down the road.

###Analysis###

For sheer value-for-money, so if you and a friend both bought SimCity, you may enjoy playing this as co-op*.

Skip **Bejeweled**

**Battlefield 3** is a very pretty large-map large-team multiplayer shooter. It stands against Modern Warfare 3 and each side of this argument has its defenders and detractors, guns, etc). As such, you *will* be at a disadvantage starting multiplayer ~2 years after release. *Edit: [rmsrk says](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1al86d/looking_for_advice_on_which_free_game_to_choose/c8yhj8l) that the first weapons you get are just as powerful as unlockables, and there are servers that restrict players to starter weapons/gear only.* Still, it is pretty.

**Need for Speed** is a Need for Speed game. Do you feel the Need? The Need for Speed? You should play Need for Speed. If you don't feel the Need for Speed

**Mass Effect 3** is the long-awaited conclusion to the massive, but not all, players. The game itself is excellent and I was less put out by the ending than most, but it's best experienced as the conclusion to the Mass Effect trilogy rather than as a stand alone game. This particular game and the Mass Effect trilogy is commonly on sale at retail and online. Note also that this Standard Edition does not include any DLC, which typically costs $5-10 per pack. ME3 also includes a 4 player co-op multiplayer mode where you defend against waves of enemies.

**SimCity 4 (Deluxe Edition)**. This is a strange inclusion

In any case. Simcity 4 was released in 2003 - 10 years ago. In some respects, aging) mod communities has fixed many of the issues that affected the game even following the desperately-needed transport-focused expansion, Rush Hour. The same communities have also created a multitude of new buildings, services, terrain doodads and other tweaks that mean that game remains playable (in widescreen!) a decade after release. Of course, SC4 is not without its issues. Cities take a comparatively long time to load and run relatively slowly, even on modern machines. Cooperative regions require fragile and ungainly hacks to get working. For most of its life, including the related subreddits

As speed = distance / time:

* DLC will be added way before modding (if modding is ever added)
* The space between the cities looks ridiculous
* They should have not been dum-dums and expected the immense demand based on their preorders alone.  How they messed this up is beyond me.

Now, and we'd all like a little more space, but it does add a bit of challenge, and they've really focused on inter-region play.  This isn't that different from the way SC4 is set up, it's just being implemented differently.  Here's a few positives to even out the bad, just from my own personal experiences.

* The game is fun.  Okay
* EA has worked hard to bring more servers online.  Every day I play I see more progress.  I'm frustrated  it's not completley reliable
* They're giving you a free game from the EA library for toughing it out.  I know that's a bribe

It would probably be a bit hard to follow parts of it without the audio and/or some programming knowledge so I'm writing this to try to help alleviate some of the emotional response to parts of the simulation seeming to be broken. I highly suggest you guys try to read through the slides though and maybe watch the [SimCity specific footage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=15v46iYUCck) which explains how the parts of GlassBox work for a few scenarios in SimCity including going to work and coming home. Seeing that should make it clear to you guys that they intended this kind of simulation logic since early development.


Disclaimer: I could be wrong about some of this stuff and things may have changed. This is just my attempt as a fan who has a lot of enthusiasm for interesting design (beyond my boring-ass development job). I've learned a lot in the past couple days and just want to share that to hopefully help people understand.

**----------------- GlassBox basics -----------------**

* ***Resources*** - This can be anything you could represent as an integer number. Power, goods, and even the population themselves are all resources.


* ***Units*** - These are the ""things"" on the map. Each unit has a state (collection of resources) and a location (where it is on the map). For the most part units are going to be buildings

Completely made up Example I'll be using later in the Agent's section: ""Smith's Residence"" is a Unit in some residential zone. It has a set of resources, 12 happiness, 2 water, 0 trash, 4 electricity, 0 sickness.


* ***Maps*** - These represent the resources that are in the environment. So this is the ""oil"" under the ground, crime, whatever. Basically anything you see in the data views thats displayed as gradient on your map (as opposed to the columns).

Units interact with Maps based on where they are. So a Coal Mine periodically will extract coal from the map under it, and fire hazard in that map. A water tower will extract water from the water table map (and I guess ground pollution, though I'm not sure if water towers actually do reduce the amount of ground pollution).

Another example shown in the video of a map is how they draw trees. I imagine there is a ""growth map"" and when you use the Nature Trees tool you're directly adding to the resource in the map where you click. This is why when you draw trees and then build a road over it, but the resource is still in the map. I imagine trees can also be planted on top of industry buildings to reduce their ground pollution similarly (there is probably a looping rule that just reduces tree amount and ground pollution every x time across maps).


* ***Globals*** - This would be a pool of resources that is associated with the game instance (no defined location).

* ***Rules*** - These are the ""verbs"" of GlassBox. They are used to move resources

Examples from the slides:

    rule harvestWood
        Money in 10
        Wood out 2
    
        People in 1
        People out 1
    end

What this rule did was it converts money resource into wood resource IF a person resource was available. The whole rule happens only if every part can occur and you can set them up with some periodicity as well as repetition.

There are different kinds of rules, or map resources. They can also give game feedback.  Map rules might move resources around (spreading of pollution). Here is a more complicated rule:

    unitRule mustardFactory

        rate 10
        global Simoleans in 1

        local YellowMustard in 6
        local EmptyBottle in 1
        local BottleOfMustard out 1

        map Pollution out 5

        successEvent effect smokePuff
        successEvent audio chugAndSlurp

        onFail buyMoreMustard
    end

So this rule runs every 10 ticks, adds 1 to the BottleOfMustard resource in the unit, puts 5 pollution on the map, and creates some visual effects/sounds. Finally, if something couldn't work (say you were out of YellowMustard in that unit), it runs another rule called ""buyMoreMustard"" which presumably would somehow get the factory more mustard.


* ***Box*** - The final main part of GlassBox - everything from the resources, globals, and rules are in the box. This would be the collection of the game scripts as well as the game state (this is what is getting synched for cloud saving).


**----------------- WHY DID THEY BUILD IT LIKE THIS? -----------------**

This architecture gives the units the simulation logic



**----------------- Agents -----------------**

Okay this is sort of a big topic to try to discuss


* ***Agents*** - These simply carry resources from one unit to another. They are NOT units in themselves in that they DON'T have their own rules. Why don't they run rules? Well the architecture of the rules is such that they seem to be periodic events fired by some unit with chaining involved. There's many orders of magnitude more agents than there are units (compare # of sims to # of buildings) so I imagine that it's simply not possible memory-wise for agents to have their own rules.

Agents are created in the unit rules (similar to how you create a resource such as ""local money in 1"" you would do ""agent People out 2"" to make 2 people agents). They're also given a destination in that rule and the rule can give some 

rudimentary instructions on how the destination should work. Other units will have ""sinks"" that advertise that they are accepting a type of agent.

Agents are controlled by *Transport Handlers* which is responsible for taking the agent to the destination unit.

Basic code:

    unitRule goToWork
        options -sendTo Work -via Car -using Road
    
        local People in 2
        agent People out 2
    end

This rule subtracts 2 people resource from the unit that the rule is associated with (probably a house) and then creates two People agents that are linked to a transport handler that will seek out a ""Work"" sink using the Roads in a car (so obey collision/traffic rules).

This is why one of the maxis devs said it would be trivial to ""fix"" the services to ignore traffic because they could just define a new transport handler that used the roads but ignored collision. It just wouldn't look great and they felt it added to the gameplay. They might still do it later though!

***Example*** So to go back to my ""Smith's Residence"" example above. It might run the goToWork rule. When it creates the People agents they're given random names that end with ""Smith"" to give the illusion of some persistence. If the ""Smith's Residence"" unit had previously accumulated enough money to become a $$ house then the agents it will emit will be $$-People (or something like that) and they will seek the nearest $$-job according to pathing. Later on the workplaces will run some sort of goHome rule that will create $$-people agents (and others) who are looking for Homes. When one gets to the Smith residence it will add to the local people number (up to the capacity), go to a shop; then an agent from a shop might come back to the Smith's Residence, add to the local people and add happiness.

**----------------- Pathing -----------------**


They're using a D*-based algorithm with wavefront updates. I'm not that informed about these kinds of algorithms and the slides covering this part have no text associated with them so this is a bit hard to piece out for me but here's my best shot:

Each sink unit advertises a capacity (number of agents of whatever type that it can hold. This defines the sink's ""strength"". E.g. a factory looking for 12 more $$ sims has a higher strength for $$ agents than one that only has one $$  sim job left. Conversely if the former factory was almost full on $ sim jobs but the latter wasn't then the latter factory would be the stronger sink for the $ sim agents.

They also say they have a modifier for the length of the road which could be based on congestion or speed limit. My thought is maybe this modifier is too weak right now but hard to say.

Anyway, or check [**this IMGUR album I just made**](http://imgur.com/a/GEs2C); the slides walk through this process of some sims leaving a house (source) and at each vertex (intersection) there is a calculated ""distance to nearest sink"" that has been modified by capacity. So the sims keep moving towards lower and lower numbers. Once another house has been added as a new sink, the system recalculates distances; in the case in the slides there is a tie between two different directions... which way they go is presumably based on the traffic light then or random choice if there is no such traffic light (e.g. power resource). Once some sims have reached the destination house the capacity is decreased which lowers that house's sink strength and the vertexes are recalculated and agents will continue towards the lower number (in this case the agents that are already close to the house will continue on, but those that are back at the first intersection will go towards the second house that's still empty).  Finally they show that there is a different virtual distance field calculation for each type of agent with some other kind of agent on the same road system.

-------------------
**My Conclusions**

Anyway


I honestly don't think the simulation is broken. It's just not balanced perfectly and could use some additional rules and tweaks to help things along.  Yeah it isn't a perfect ""city simulator"" and I was depressed for a bit about that but I think that's maybe unrealistic and if we keep an open mind and give it some time to get fixed we'll be able to have fun in this system.

That's not to say that Maxis are faultless. While I'm sure the Maxis devs are working hard on trying to fix it; I imagine they just released when it wasn't quite ready and a lot of these problems would have been caught a lot faster with better beta testing/fixed a lot faster if they weren't working on making the servers not crash. The game just needed more tuning and I think it'll get there.

The biggest bright side of all this is that the system is really easily tweakable. I don't know how much Maxis intends to allow for users to create their own rules and mods (man,False,self,t5_2ryr3,False,,,t3_1a9fz6

If this post helped you get your money back
-----------------------

*EDIT: It's funny how people get upset if you downvote someone for their opinion on here

So I have seen a lot of people post about how they have given up on the game. But most of them say nothing about them getting their money back. If you are unhappy with the game, you can always buy it again. But right now EA is just trying to string people along for as long as possible, because the longer you wait, the less likely you will be to get your money back. Whether it's because you just gave up and don't care, or because they think the longer you have the game the less likely your credit card company will be to approve your dispute.

This isn't about getting your money back because you simply didn't like the game. It's about getting your money back because you were lied to through false advertisements, and EA refuses to give refunds even to those people. As far as I'm concerned, EA does not deserve a dime for this game after all the lies and carelessness that has come with this game. I could go on about how corrupt Always-Online DRM is, but sadly, for SimCity, that is not the problem here.

And just so people are aware, if you want to verify.

So here's what you do.

1. Seek out a refund from wherever you bought it from. Origin, etc. Even though the chances Origin will give you a refund are like 1 in a billion, you need to do it. This step is very important. Make sure you take down the date, time, and name of person you spoke with. If this fails you will need most, if not all, of that information later.

2. If you didn't use PayPal, open a dispute. Make sure you make it clear that you tried to resolve the issue with the seller. Again, make sure to take down the date, time, and name of the person if possible. (I am not sure if PayPal gives you the name of the person that handles your case)

3. ***Make sure to read this entire step***  
If that doesn't work, and is as defective as a game can be. If a long time has passed, you can also mention that you were waiting to see if the company would fix the game in a timely manner, and they didn't. At this point, there is not such thing as too much information/detail. You are pretty much building a case against EA to persuade your credit card company to get your money back.  
**Just to clarify
*Chargebacks can take some time to process. I am not sure if this is standard
**If you used PayPal, even into the negatives. If it goes into the negatives, PayPal will lock your account until you rectify your balance, essentially giving them the money back, at least until you are at $0.00 balance.**

Hopefully by now you have your money back. Most people got their money back through a chargeback

**READ THIS ENTIRE SECTION BEFORE DOING ANYTHING**   
If possible, and don't want to do business with them if they can't get your $60 (Or however much it cost you) back. Make sure you tell them how much, because most companies would rather get you your $60 than lose you as a customer. If they don't then at that point it's up to you to decide whether or not you really want to stay with them. Personally, I wouldn't. But cancelling your credit card is not the point of this thread. I'm just trying to help you get your money back. So you decide.

So there you have it. All the advice I have on how to get your money back. Best of luck. And remember

----------------------------------

There have been some good questions asked in this thread so I will include them along with my response here.

-----------------------

&gt;I am waiting for 2.0 first

I am willing to bet that EA is dragging out this 2.0 patch as long as possible to help deter people from getting refunds/chargebacks.

From one gamer to another, you can always repurchase.

-----------------------

&gt;My banks a Federal Credit Union but the cards they issue out are Visa. Do I contact Visa about a Charge back after I talk to EA? Or do I contact my Federal Credit Union?

Your best bet is to contact whoever you received the credit card from.

-----------------------

&gt;I purchased the boxed copy from GMG with my debit card (bank account) and would like to know of any advice. You can't just do a chargeback.

First off

If that doesn't work

-----------------------

&gt;Tried the bank and they said they couldn't do anything

When you call them ask them that if they aren't willing to protect you from people who are essentially scamming them then why should you stay with them?

As long as you don't have a history of anything like that

Customer care is rapidly diminishing these days because so many people are willing to take whatever they are told. If a company/bank/whatever is treating you like shit

-----------------------

&gt;I paid cash at a game stop

First off

You can try calling Gamestop and ask to speak to a manager. Ask him if they will issue you a refund for SimCity because [**Insert 1 of a billion possible reasons here**]. Although I don't advocate lying just to get your money, and you will be writing a letter to Gamestop's Corporate Offices. Hopefully that will work.

I submitted a ticket to their refund department and shortly after I was told they would not be giving me a refund as per their TOS. I advised them that the game was significantly not as described insofar that you expect a product to work when it is sold, but mine still had not appeared yet.

The dispute was filed, and that it was a defective product. A few more days passed, no response from GreenManGaming, and so then I escalated the dispute for paypal to review. Another week passed, no response from GMG to respond to the dispute, and then finally they commented on the case (comments not visible to me). A week later, a paypal employee reviewed the dispute and filed in favour of the seller. I would not be getting my refund from paypal or GMG.

I then did some research to see what would happen if I filed a visa chargeback against Paypal and discovered that if I ever did a charge back from my visa to paypal

**Traffic Pathing Algorithm**
&gt;Indeed :)
Ok, one graph per destination type.
Some of those are pedestrian destinations (like a house, etc...) some are ""transit"" pedestrian destinations (like a bus stop that will lead you to a house, a street car stop that will lead you to a workplace, etc...). Those are used by the pedestrians and the stops to figure out who should go where.
Then there's a bunch of sets that are used by the transit vehicles themselves, ""drop off streetcar passengers near a workplace"", ""drop off muni bus passengers near a home"", and finally, ""go from stop to stop"".
Whenever a transit vehicle makes a stop, if there is still room for passengers, the vehicle will try to go to stops that have people waiting. If it's full (or with a small chance if there's still room) then it will go straight to the first valid drop off point in a list, based on its passengers desired destination.
If it's empty
Hope this helps figuring out how to play the transit game!

1362784913.0,19xwhx,Distribution of Client and Server Responsibilities Explained,DBrickShaw,231,30,25,"As we all know EA/Maxis has been very insistent that the centralized cloud server setup of SimCity is required to support the regional play

Here's my working theory for how the processing responsibilities are distributed between client and server:

**ALL** AI agent simulation is performed on the client side

* Speaking from a purely technical standpoint, you can lose your connection to the EA/Maxis servers for hours at a time and the intra-city gameplay keeps working perfectly fine.

* Cities which are not being actively played show no signs whatsoever of intra-city development. Zoned land does not develop. The number of jobs, and ore/coal/oil deposits are not exhausted. When you stop playing a city only a static snapshot of the city and the services it provides are saved to the server.

So how does inter-city regional play work? As far as I can figure, there is no AI agent that actually travels from their home in the other city to their workplace in your city. What happens is that your client uses the static snapshot of the other city to determine how many workers are available and willing to commute to your city, and generates these AI agents on the highway leaving the other city. I would expect that your client also notifies the server of how many workers it's generated so that the snapshot can be updated for other active clients, but this is near impossible to test with the current delay on syncing between cities in a region. All passive services are handled similarly (i.e. water, power, sewage, etc.).

So what are the implications of this architecture?

* Industrial resource chains are fundamentally broken (especially for single-player): You've probably noticed by now that there's no way to have a city passively supply another city with industrial resources (i.e. they must be manually gifted by the player while actively playing the city), it stops generating resources. Because of this the workflow for having a multiple city industrial chain is frustrating, at best. Let's say you have a city devoted to smelting alloy, and a city devoted to building processors. To make this work with a single player you'd need to play the industrial city until your freight depots are full, manually gift the resources to the processor city, then switch to the processor city to produce the processors, over and over. When you're playing the processor city no alloy is being produced, but in the game's current state city synchronization can take hours

* Server demands related to simulation are significantly lower than you probably expect: With this setup, but I think the bulk of what's bringing the game to its knees is probably the global market. Every 60 minutes of ingame time each of the trade depots/ports in your active city interact with the global market, and the calculation of global market prices seems like the only form of processing which spans between regions. This also explains why cheetah speed has been temporarily removed, as speeding up the ingame time also speeds up the rate at which your trade structures periodically make requests to the global market. **Edit**: The server also performs client action validation, as described in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/19xx7d/trying_some_technical_analysis_of_the_server/). This is a huge source of load that I hadn't considered, and is more likely the reason cheetah was disabled (especially since the global market seems to be using fixed prices at the moment).

* With the exception of the global market, players and hosting companies could host dedicated servers (1 per region) that are responsible for storage and distribution of save states to active clients. This would bring the risk of losing your cities when your favourite server goes down, but backing up of regions to the local client could be easily implemented. It also opens the possibility of having multiplayer for modded games (i.e. pick a server with your favourite set of mods running, and you and yours friends can all play with mods together).

So why did EA/Maxis choose this network architecture?

* DRM and planned obsolescence: I think this plays a huge role in the decision

* Elimination of user mods: This part of the system actually bothers me more than the DRM. Unlike previous SimCity games whose lifetimes were continually extended by user mods, but this will never be a possibility.

Thoughts? I'm very interesting in any observations you've made which would help prove or refute my theory of the network architecture. Has anyone noticed if workers stop commuting to your city when you lose your connection to the server? That data would really help determine how exactly the worker/service sharing is actually implemented. Also

1345119569.0,ybex6,[UPDATE] I have been playing SimCity 5 yesterday for over an hour. Here are the answers to the community's questions! (part 1),dudelsac,214,21,70,"Hi guys

sorry to keep you waiting, I was afraid they'd kick me out :D

I have been playing SimCity 5 at the Maxis booth, which led you through some easy steps: protesters in front of the city hall. They were demanding that I connect the city to the adjacent highway. Afterwards, other speech bubbles were popping up around town: Build a power plant, build water towers, build a school etc. This was a good introduction into the game, but for me as a experienced SC player, it felt a little shallow. To be honest

But this initial bummer was gone when I started my other runs: The other times

But I was just being dumb: They have a new interface at the bottom, but you also have access to corresponding data layers - in this case the traffic layer, the pollution layer and so on. And let me tell you this before diving into your questions: The game is not as deep as SimCity 4, at least from what I could gather - But this lack of depth was made up for when you realize that the simulation is really great. The data layers are just awesome and I wish I would have a picture to show you their glory. There were data layers for almost everything: Happiness, Income, pollution, sewage, efficiency (radius) of civic buildings and many

Anyway

&gt; **an honest commentary on the ratio of plop to plot. also whether choosing a city type is an explicit choice.**

It was just like in the previous SimCitys: All zones (R, like extra garages for the police station. So don't worry about too much plopping, it will be like in SC4. And it was possible (though a little fiddly) to bulldoze everything, so you shouldn't be commited to an explicit choice.

&gt; **What is the ""single-player"" experience like? For the conservative players (read old-school) amongst us - how does it translate in comparison to previous editions?**

The demo was set up on some kind of server (they had to reboot it after some play sessions), the SimCity World will be more prominent in the final game, but in the demo, I was totally in my own little space. 

As for the comparison, it really felt like a true SimCity. It was defnitily less realistic and not as micro-managy as SC4 was, but it was very deep when you looked for the details. And it was defnititely not comparable to SC: Societies, since that felt like a totally different game. Not so for SC5. Some may think it is too cartoony, with all the speech bubbles popping up, but those little details made me feel much more connected to my sims. In SC4, you were like a detached god looking over the city, but I can imagine that it is not for everyone.

&gt; **I would love to know how the services (medical, You plopped a school down and it had a radius around it that showed who it serviced. Has that changed? I think it would be great if you could create a customizable service area for schools and hospitals (think staff zones in Roller Coaster Tycoon)!**

It was kind of like in Cities XL: The reach is calculated by the amount of time the emergency vehicles take to reach their destination. So essentially, I tested that extensively. Funny sidenote: The police station had a radius of its own, but the patroling cars also spreaded the reach. The data layer became green in realtime where the cars were driving. The more police cars I added to my station, the more green area was ""driving around"". It was really neat to watch.

&gt; **I would like to see how much of that greenspace you can get rid of. Try to get buildings close to the street

Just like in SC4, some had less. So I guess that once you know how to ""trick"" the system, you can get rid of most of the green areas. Also, larger buildings had less green, just like you would expect it.

&gt; **Also

We had only one city in the demo, the road building system looked pretty adaptive.

&gt; **finally, do you find it to be like lego, or can you actually put together some pretty complicated stuff. Something prokissmo or somy would do, is it possible?**

I tried it on the garbage plant and the police station. At the garbage dump, editing all that was horizontally, not vertically. Not so for the police station: I build a cell block on top of the building and another cell block on top of that cell block. I wanted to stack another on top, but the game wouldn't let me. I didn't have time to test the editor more than that but it looked very flexible. I could have built the cell block on the ground beside the building too for example. It really looks like a fun addition and it should also satisfy the craving for more micro-management.

&gt; **Can you build narrow roads, they are pretty spaced outl)**

This is tricky, which would space out things a little bit more. But it should definitely be possible with some clever layouts.

&gt; **Tell me if we

This is a tough one. From what I've seen, because I only saw a limited demo but I will tell you this: I liked what I saw. It was definitely different, but it felt like a true SimCity after getting used to all the new stuff. I would have needed much more time with the game to really give an answer that would be fair to the game and to you.

&gt; **Stick it on a USB and share it with us ;)**

I still cannot believe that they gave it to me, [THE DEMO OF SIMCITY 5 FROM GAMESCOM!!!](https://maoctopus.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/download-bear.jpg)

&gt; **can you please find out about agriculture and farming? I have seen no farm kind of things yet and I'm curious if they are going to include it at all

In the demo, so my guess would be that it isn't in the game. But don't count on it, they could still be adding that afterwards.

I really just wanted to shout out /u/maxisMC for sticking with us.  Its clear that the game release wasn't what people wanted and being an individual who on their own couldn't control the overall company MaxisMC has stuck with us and born the brunt of our hate on this sub CONSISTENTLY through the launch.


I try to imagine what it would be like to be /u/maxismc or another person within the SimCity team right now.  Its very likely that I'd be lower ranking in the org and was working on the project because I loved the franchise.  I would be a couple of years into working on my project and was super into all the exciting pieces of what I had done.  Then... Shit...  The game was balled up.  Someone up the chain fucked up...  Technical glitches and PR gaffes as well as a general


So what do I do?  I fucking dig in an bust my balls.  I was supposed to get to celebrate with the community and have fun but instead I make myself the connection that people have; I'm trying to bear the brunt of anger so that the community can at least feel a little bit like they're being cared for.

The only solution to piracy is to make it an unattractive option. The ignorant traditional solution has been to punish paying customers by limiting usage, and putting further restrictions on the PAID product (see the irony). Pirates remain unaffected, and this cause-and-effect is pathetic. I use pirated versions of several apps *that I purchased*, because the pirated version doesn't need USB dongles or online connections.

Even a fully cloud-based solution misses the point. This limits the user experience so much that users will be compelled to find another solution. For example the new Office licensing scheme simply makes users want to look elsewhere. The open source community kicks in here.

As a long-time software developer, something that's could be the greatest yet, but is infected to the point where the reception will be bitter-sweet.

I had expectations for SimCity based on the previous versions. SimCity has always been my most ""introverted"" game. It's a decidedly single-player game, I wanted just a little something else. Curvy roads, less grid...

SimCity 5 was advertised as ""your"" SimCity. Finally a SimCity that actually is a real simulation. Deals equally well with grid cities or curvy cities. And finally a SimCity that's ""built to be modded"". From the videos I saw

And for that the developers must be proud. But they must hate the fact that this exciting potential is ruined by a shaky foundation: this online DRM garbage. If there was an offline single player mode

I even knew that the game would require an Internet connection

1. Your city names cannot contain foul language. Not a big deal
2. The obvious connection issues... Online queueing for a single player game with no substantive reason to be connected is just horrible.
3. I cannot play in introverted moments like on transportation, etc.
4. If I must switch servers
5. Potential to lose my progress entirely
6. I cannot save my favorite cities locally or send them to a friend.

My point is that online DRM is not merely a DRM

As it is, it just makes me feel like I wasted my money and I'm wasting my time. Most of the details of SimCity are exactly what I wanted, but the online DRM transforms the entire thing into some game I would never have bought in the first place. I never thought I would ever feel duped by a SimCity game.

I wish I could complain about the small city size


**tl;dr:**

1. I have been duped based on expectations from previous SimCity versions.
2. Online DRM is not just a licensing module
3. I ""like"" this game like I like a steak covered in sewage. In theory yes. But I won't be digging in any time soon.

- Sharing services between cities suddenly stops for no reason whatsoever. It most often happens with water closely behind all the others.

- City Hall upgrades aren't being recognized to the other cities.

- Traffic paths are still broken beyond belief. Alexander from Maxis's blog post did 0 help. After about 90 minutes in a new city that was entirely based on his suggestions

- Things they didn't include like subways, etc were all changed to street cars? They are a horrible replacement.

- There were some very fun things in older versions like agriculture that are gone now. Not only is it not realistic

- Casinos are still obviously broken.

- The city sizes are still way too small

- Gifting is still bugged. If it rarely even happens

- ONE entrance to almost every city? Yeah that's realistic. Which major cities in the world only have 1 single road connection to enter and exit them?

- After about an hour of playing on 4 different and new regions

- Dr Vu and Maxis Man

Believe me I could go on. The beta test was obviously a joke and should have involved a lot more people. I cannot believe EA and Maxis didn't know the servers would have been overloaded based on the pre-sales alone. Servers should have been set aside to handle the load and deployed in minutes

Despite all this, AT&amp;T, etc. Really gamers?? It only shows you have 0 experience with real-life, and that's pretty sad. Telling for sure.

It's because the tiny city size is so limiting (my biggest complaint), the bugs are so bad, the ""multiplayer"" aspect doesnt feel like that at all, etc etc ...

Every one of my cities just seems to get to the point of being boring due to no further room to expand, you're not really connected to 15 other players b/c no city has road or rail connections to more than 3 or 4 neighboring cities.  Also how about some city shape other than perfect squares?  Looks dumb.  This wasnt an issue in SC4 b/c the plots were big enough that you probably didnt need to always build right to the edge anyway. 

Also as for the whole supposed ""MMO"" concept... if you mouse over icons of other cities/players it's not uncommon to see ""last time played 2 weeks ago"" or something like that.

Anyway, I caught up on an episode of The Walking Dead.

She called me back into the den about an hour later, and a few blocks of reasonably spaced out residential, commercial, and industrial sites. Water, sewage, and garbage were in place and workin fine. She even dropped a clinic and a fire station. Everything looked normal – no high density buildings, no wacky road layouts, the kind you make after an hour without any major foresight as to any of the problems we’ve all come to know about this game.

Then I saw the rubble and heard the sirens. Two of her buildings, turn around in the middle of the road, and drive to the other end, continually, while the building in another block burned. There was no traffic, there were no wacky elevation changes or curves or intersections, there were no strange dirt roads adding phantom turn arounds or anything. It was simply a fire truck U-turning for no reason

That building burnt down and another caught fire. The fire spread while the single fire truck endlessly went in a U-turn type of circle

“What happened?” I asked her.

“I don’t know. A fire started and I saw my truck leave the fire station and it’s been going in this circle ever since. It won’t go to where the burning building is. It just does this.”

We watched for a few more minutes as more buildings caught fire. I briefly considered grabbing to mouse to intervene and ""trick"" the game by demolishing roads or quickly adding another fire truck to her existing station

My wife was annoyed. She spent an hour enjoying herself with the game, and 10 buildings ended up burning down, which at this starter city level, was a good chunk of her city.

That was it for her, I had a promising vision of buying another copy, and then an evening building cities side by side with my non-gamer wife.

After quitting, which included “my” city from earlier in the week. 

Her words

**TL;DR: My non-gamer wife played SC5 and had an hour’s worth of fun building a decent little 500 population city. Ridiculous path finding AI resulted in a burnt down city and a wife who will never play this game again.** 

**She also cannot find any logical reason why I couldn’t simply delete a city that will never be played again.**

1363461897.0,1af8jw,Guide – How to Get Rid of Germs,simcitymastery,207,32,40,"Germs, and people still complaining about Germs. In this short guide I'll try to teach you how to get rid of those little bastards!

*(I apologize for any English mistakes you may find in the text. English is not my native language


**How to get rid of germs?**

Germs are a problem because they cause sickness. Sick Sims don’t go to work and don’t shop, so **in order to get rid of germs you need to get rid of pollution**. 

These are the kinds of pollution that cause germs: **air pollution**, **sewage**, and **water pollution**. If you manage to combat all those kinds of pollution, you will be able to minimize germs in your town. Keep in mind that sometimes it will be impossible to have zero germs, so the best thing you can do is minimize the germs and have a hospital treating sick Sims.

**How to get rid of pollution?**

**Air pollution**

Air pollution comes from industries and other builds such as coal and oil power plants. That doesn't mean you can’t have these kind of building in your city

Another way to combat air pollution is planting trees (the option *Plant Forest* in *Parks* &gt; *Nature*). Trees remove pollution and die if they're in a heavily polluted environment. When they die you have to replant them.

**Ground pollution**

Ground pollution comes from **garbage** and **sewage**.

**Dealing with garbage:** Sims create garbage and garbage becomes ground pollution if not collected. To deal with garbage, which will cause Sims to separate recycling from garbage. The Recycling Center will reduce pollution, because you’ll have less garbage in the city, and will produce resources (alloy, metal, and plastic), which can be sold through a Trade Depot. Keep in mind the even with a Recycling Center you still need a Garbage Dump to collected the regular garbage.

**Dealing with sewage:** Sims produce sewage and sewage becomes ground pollution. The Sewage Outflow Pipes collect sewage and converts it into group pollution, not always it's possible to build a Sewage Treatment Plant in the beginning (in order to build it you need a City Hall and a Department of Utilities **in the region**). If you don't have access to the Sewage Treatment Plant, use Sewage Outflow Pipes in a area away from your city and surround it with trees to minimize ground pollution. As soon as you have access to the Sewage Treatment Plant build it, close the Sewage Outflow Pipes and destroy them when they get empty. After this plant some threes on the place to eliminate the ground pollution left (Keep in mind it may take a long time and you may need to replant the trees several times).

**Water pollution**

If you place a Water Tower or Water Pumping Stating above polluted ground

**Wellness Center**

Besides eliminating pollution, which is an add on the the Hospital. Each Wellness Center will provide a wellness van, which will visit and clean buildings, removing the germs for some time.

This is quite inconvenient when you try to understand how many and what type of zones/buildings you need to add/modify in your city. For example

So, that can be enabled/disabled? I understand that it will be much lower number (10 times lower for larger cities) but I personally do not care. It is better for me to see the actual number of sims, then to see 200,000 and trying to guess that it is likely 30,000 of actual sims in the city.

*  Utilities are used locally and excess utilities are traded to other zones in the region
*  Agents are representative of data and not a function of it
*  Utilities flow without using roads but in the case of police/fire/freighters are influenced by transit
*  Mass transit/public transports allows effective connections between all regions
*  Build-able ports and airports 
*  Online component similar to Steam Workshop: you can post mods, leaderboards, etc, are all optional fluff. No online gameplay required.

The challenge came from expanding once your city needed to grow beyond what your initial ideas were.  You had to re-purpose areas, using all the data views to help make that decision. 



In SC5, layout some general areas and then fill in.  The next step is where it becomes harder and more fun, and that next step doesn't really exist.

I think the engine despite its faults is decent

Has anyone gotten regional commuting to work in a decent way?  I find myself having tremendous amounts of unfilled jobs in any 'balanced' city I make,False,self,t5_2ryr3,False,,,t3_1az3t0

* New tourists will now decide to come into a city once leaving tourists reach train stations

* This change should reduce the downtime of tourist buildings.

* Casinos: Casinos tuned so that Gambling will be a more profitable specialty. Players must bulldoze and replace existing casinos to see effects of tuning.

* The larger casinos now invite more tourists into the city which helps keep them full.

* Note that existing casinos will need to be replaced to take advantage of this change.

* More Casinos: Raised module limit on Sci-Fi and Sleek Casinos to 6 modules.  

* Region Play: Cash gifts can now be received in a bankrupt city.

* Education: Fixed school buses getting stuck at the high school. Existing Schools will fix themselves.

* Education: Fixed school buses picking up students at neighboring cities that didn’t have school bus stops. 

* Education: Fix to more accurately track regional student population.

* Education: Fix where kids leaving the school bus stop would teleport to the nearest pedestrian path instead of walking directly into the school. 

* Education: University wings now give the proper bonus.

* Recycling: Fix for the Recycling Center where it would sometimes stop working

* Air pollution: Fixed issue where air pollution would appear to come from nowhere. Fix issues where your regional air pollution would be reflected back into your box for a double penalty.  

* Fire Service: Fire Trucks don’t clump

* Water: Water pumps are now capable of pumping water from rivers at a larger radius so they can take better advantage of the water table in a city.

* Transit: A city with residents and public transit will now provide the accurate amount of workers and shoppers to its neighbors.

* Transit: A transit vehicle stuck in a pick-up or drop off loop will now go back to a garage instead of trying to pick up more people.

* Transit vehicles should recover automatically after the update. If players want to force the recovery, then turn them back on. 

* Transit:  Neighbors buses will now come in lower numbers into the city and do a better job at picking up local passengers first. 

* Traffic: Medium density roads now create traffic lights at intersections with other roads and avenues of equal or higher density.

* Residential Tuning: Residential-only cities have failure state.

* Buildings are prevented from going up in density when they don’t have power or water.

* The amount of happiness gained from low taxes, and health outreach has been lowered.

* Fixed some cases where buildings would not go abandoned when they should have.

* Higher density residential buildings are no longer blocked from going abandoned due to not having enough money.

* Happiness from low taxes does not double up every time it is given.

* Losing happiness due to not having a job is more impactful.

* Budgets: Fixed bug with monthly transactions being used to get around systems pushing back.  

* Systems like fire, sewage don’t turn on until you've made a certain amount of money.  Gifts from neighbors are taken into account as well.

* You can no longer create a city that never gets fires, or other pushback issues.

* Income progression (which we use to turn on pushback systems) was not including transactions from gifts

* Income progression should always go up regardless if you have higher expenses. It is the total income that you are bringing in from your city that turns on pushback systems.

* Audio: Fixes issue where audio will stop working after creating a large city or where phantom audio sounds play in a city.

* Demolish: Fixes issue that occurred when players demolished buildings that had service vehicles, the agents would be in a state of limbo and would not recover when new buildings of that type were placed. This will no longer happen.",,False,self,t5_2ryr3,1366680242.0,maxisflair,

1363628029.0,1aj9oh,A civil response to Straight Answers from Lucy Bradshaw,protoculturist,190,38,42,"Heads up this a content driven post

For the complete article head over to EA: http://www.ea.com/news/simcity-update-straight-answers-from-lucy

Having played Simcity 2013 since launch I wanted to take a second to response to the recent post on EA.com from Maxis General Manager Lucy Bradshaw.  First off
One basis for numerous complaints about the game is the always online requirement, gifting when disaster strikes and collaborating on epic projects really does capture the imagination.  The first time I caught a glimpse of a glimmering skyline in the distance really made me smile.  Need fire trucks, help is one the way!  Breaking the bank?  Load up the armored car!  Boy did those tools add a lot to my game play experience at the outset.   I began to imagine my sims having a life, and the cities around me as part of that life.  So for that Maxis/EA I thank you.  All that said imagination and reality are different things.
 
Ok with my highest praise out of the way let us explore some of the claims made in the article and how they relate to my experience with the game.  The following statements were given as examples of how the online requirement serves to enhance gameplay not just arbitrarily control players. 

1.	“We keep the simulation state of the region up to date for all players.  Even when playing solo
I assume this statement refers to the fact that even when a player is offline resources shared with the region are still made available to active players.  This system means that if I send you fire trucks and then log off, blocked by a bug detailed below.  All in all, the feature she describes does work, but given the instability of resource sharing in general what does it matter that an offline player can share too?

2.	“Players who want to reach the peak of each specialization can count on surrounding cities to provide services or resources
Counting on surrounding cities for resources and workers is almost completely broken.  Getting regional commuters is great, a bug replicates the number of commuters when they don’t reach their destination in time.  This means that traffic preventing commuters from reaching their destination will infinitely spawn commuters trying to enter your town, completely shutting down a city.  Everyone I play with has encountered inexplicably massive traffic sufficient to shut down a city.  Sharing resources is also problematic as a 50MW surplus of power shows up as far less in the menu to actually purchase power regionally.  This means players with excess can’t actually sell that excess and players with need can’t actually fill those needs.  Water, when purchased from the regional market, suffers from frequent and inexplicable “brown outs” which can cripple a city.  The solution?  Don’t rely on regional resources or commuters.

3.	“Our Great Works rely on contributions from multiple cities in a region.  Connected services keep each player’s contributions updated and the progression on Great Works moving ahead.”
Adding resources to a great work area seems to function on initial testing.  Unlocking the process was democratic in that several people have to agree on the project

4.	“All of our social world features - world challenges
All these features are currently disabled.  The challenges menu recently became active but will not start for 3 days.  At this time

5.	“Our servers handle gifts between players.”
Gifts between players can buttress flagging economies

6.	“We’ve created a dynamic supply and demand model for trading by keeping a Global Market updated with changing demands on key resources.”
I have yet to see any indication that global prices fluctuate at all.  I assume these features are disabled as well.  Commodities sell for the same price in every city I create

7.	“We update each city’s visual representation as well.  If you visit another player’s city
This feature does work, but game conditions are often sorely out of sync.  Modifications to the city do not show up in real time and the city itself offers a view of how it was,  some undetermined time in the past;  all this despite messages about “syncing cities” when initiating a visit.

8.	“We even check to make sure that all the cities saved are legit, challenges and achievements rewards and status have integrity.”
Ok this is a nod to DRM.  Checking to ensure that a city is “legit” means verifying that no conditions outside their scheme of control have taken place.  Can it mean anything else?  Pretty unclear as to what exactly they verify since a prominent mod of the game recently revealed a debug mode allowing modifications outside city bounds which are save-able.   “Verification” tools like this have been used in other games to ban players using modifications to game code, just her being honest about an important feature of their always online requirement.  It is not arbitrary control from their point of view since businesses view this as a means to prevent loss.  The efficacy of that technique is probably debatable but I’ll leave that alone.  

The game as it stands is enjoyable if a bit under-cooked.  The online potential of the game is clear.  When those features are fully enabled, and an online game you cant play with friends.  Caught between these two extremes Maxis has some work to do convincing the community that their intentions were always about getting a truly multi-player experience into Simcity.  For an MMO style game, they seem to struggle with even the most basic multi-player experiences.  More likely this game was designed the way all city builders are for the personal experience of creating a unique and lifelike city.  The online conditions of the game arrive through a desire to expand the franchise into the increasingly profitable realm of online play while guaranteeing powerful protection against piracy and unauthorized user modifications.  I would urge EA and Maxis to embrace the fervent community of fans in crowd sourcing solutions to these problems.  Surely tens of thousands can accomplish more than a few dozen.  It would ingratiate a loyal player base, improve technical communication between players and developers, and probably help out over worked programmers facing a seriously up-hill battle.  But hey what do I know, Im no game executive.

@MaxisGuillaume I just made a 500K+ city. No I
@holtmiester where did your Sims get their happiness from? Other nearby cities?

I happened to have Guill on my Twitter usually for the sole purpose of having a question answered (or ignored) or to get information on what's going on with the ""simulation.""

When that Tweet happened I was in game (after having created another region since mine was ""missing"" and chimed in with: https://twitter.com/MaxisGuillaume/status/315872614759403521

I am the top tweet but not the person who began the conversation.

What's missing from the entire conversation is my explanation about how you don't need Industrial regardless of whether you have other cities providing happiness. I tagged the first tweet as ""clueless"" because as we have learned from that entire conversation - he was. In fact three more messages came from Guill the last one telling me to go ask one of the other devs - when that's all he really had to say.

Was typing ""clueless"" mean or wrong? I guess that's your perception. Our household bought 6 copies of the Deluxe Edition. In the US that equates to 480.00 our family spent for a game that doesn't work as intended. There's nothing Deluxe about cities burning down, cities being constantly rolled back, busses being stuck, cars being stuck, pedestrians blocking traffic, brown and missing textures that make your city look like crap when you're zoomed out, criminals that won't leave your city,000 visitors you can't get rid of and honestly - the list goes on and on.

But even in all of that I still have tried to stay in the middle of the problems

I have used my Twitter account to post every bug

The last straw for me was when I realized Maxis was blocking people for asking questions and asking for clarification. If you're an adult and you're on Twitter and a tweet as tagged as ""clueless"" and you feel you shipped a quality game then I don't know what to tell you.

Was it insulting? No more insulting than the state of the game my family paid almost $500.00 for. That's insulting. As a matter of fact we play a lot of games. We have extensive libraries and we can't think of one other game that has had these amount of issues still in tact a month after launch and where the devs have blown as much smoke as we've gotten this month.

We have had at best, soon and soon. No explanation, no idea what's coming - absolutely no reassurance and if you ask those tough questions - you're blocked and no longer matter even though YOU shipped this crap game. Your vision stinks by the way whoever dreamed this one up.

And so - to the delight of many Redditor's and the Delight of Maxis - we're done. AMEX has refunded our 480.00 bucks and we are not coming back. We don't care about our Origin games

480.00 bucks may not hit you in the wallet but again

To everyone else who can stick with it

1364234164.0,1azhry,It's not SimCity 5. It's a SimCity reboot with a lot of unfinished work.,MaxisHelper,241,105,150,"OK, I've moved onto a stage of grief which some of you have yet to reach--acceptance. I went through a confusion stage

I've accepted the fact that this game was released earlier than it should have been. Those in development must have known about the issues we are all seeing--even with the most recent patch (1.8 as I write this). They should have seen the convoys of busses, syncing of power, sewage, etc. is mostly delay-free), we still have major issues with commuting. With commuting broken, the small size of the cities is horribly apparent. My initial desire to overcome the small city size was to utilize the region fully and build my residential cities and my industrial cities separately and have my people commute. This does not work yet.

So here is where I get to my point... ""YET"" is my point. It seems that the development team is still working diligently on fixing what they know is broken and can fix quickly

I would bet that the long-term goal for SimCity is a model not unlike The Sims, I highly doubt the executives are going to pull the plug on the game and just stop development--they sold a lot of copies. More likely they will eventually get the game to a place where it should have been at launch--all features working and optimally tuned. Commuters commuting, students traveling to universities, Fire trucks not traveling in a conga-line, busses reducing traffic problems, not creating them, etc.

In the end, I signed up for the betas and played as much as I could while they were online. If they offered an open ended beta for the full price of the game, I would have paid it, and essentially had the experience I've had thus far. Once the commuting, tourists, and conga-lines are fixed, the game (IMO) will be ready for release and we can start looking forward to expansions--bigger cities, all that good stuff. Too bad the game is already out there and everyone has a bad taste in their mouth now

Bad decisions were made to rush this thing out the door without fully grasping the consequences. The gaming community is one of the most connected groups in our society. By nature we are online more than the average consumer, and commiserate. You can't fuck us over and think it will be taken lying down. Most people, I feel, are frustrated by the fact that they paid for a broken game. I'm in my 30's now so $50 or whatever for a game is really nothing for me given the hours of entertainment I get--I mean a meal out that lasts for a couple hours costs me more. But for some of the kids out there that have to scrape together the dough to buy each game they do--well they're the ones who truly got screwed when they bough SimCity over their other choices at the time. In the end, I'm confident they'll get what they paid for, but that's not going to settle any of the rage we all are currently feeling.

Here's what I'm doing now to enjoy the game as much as possible… I'm building cities that don't need commuting. Small cities, gambling cities (where casinos lose tons of money unfortunately), etc. These cities will all be there when the big fixes come out. At that point I'll have fun converting them to the specialized residential centers, or industrial centers I want them to eventually be. When we can expand their size, they will have a history in them for sure--albeit a tortured one in my memory.

Let's encourage the good folks doing their job every day developing the fixes we crave (they aren't the ones that pushed this out the door too early). Let's try to give as much constructive criticism as possible, write the deservedly poor reviews, rant here and elsewhere, make hilarious memes, but let's keep in mind if we get what we really want, this game will be great in the end, expansion packs will come out with cool new features, just imagine where things will be in 5 years or more. The core concept will really allow for amazing growth of the series--they needed to reboot

One last thing: a plea to the executives. Please don't let the troubles of the last few weeks kill this thing. The concept may be cracked in places, EXPANSIONS!!
