I just met this Mr.Ham guy earlier

These guys have over 1000 keys in their hidden inventories. For a proof of this

They try to sell bad low tier items for high prices

There was this guy who was BEGGING to sell his Sunfire Wardog in tf2outpost.com for 18 keys because he thought it was its price

I'm not posting this to troll anyone, or all of those people who bought CR frogs for 15 keys. Don't fall for it, people. If you see anyone quoting that site it's a shark for sure, and do your own research before you sell any of your items, you might be getting scammed for your valuable items.

So :

1. Never send anyone an email from the account connected to your steam account

Why do we feel the need to attack others because of shifts in pricing of volatile items?  This is NOTHING new to the community.  

I remember last year during TI2, and I ended up with a bunch of Tb's and Hooks.  Back then hooks were mythical and went for about 3-4 keys, Tbs were uncommons and they weren't worth shit because they were ugly before they got updated and became the first Immortal.  I had Greedy Greevils when they were worth 40 keys, and I had Kantusas when they were worth 50. I didn't always come out ahead as things appreciate and depreciate and yes, I occasionally made some bad trades. 

TLDR; My point is, instead everyone is behaving like children as of late.  I'd really like to revisit the feeling of community and brotherhood that we used to have here, but everyone's being a Greedy Greevil.

1354656595.0,14a6wp,[PSA] How to safely trade Dota 2/Steam-tradable items for currency over Paypal or Moneypak!,musical_hog,98,8,38,"In this guide

I will assume you know how to find a buyer/seller and list your items. That information should be obvious

Full disclosure: **selling items for cash over Paypal is never 100% safe. Chargebacks can and do happen

*****

***Step One: Rep rep rep!***

When selling or buying an item over Paypal

*Update: It is highly encouraged to check if your buyer's Paypal account is verified. [Follow these steps!](http://redd.it/19youv)*


**[SteamRep](http://steamrep.com)** is your *best friend* when determining whether someone is reputable or not. SteamRep is a scam report database

* [Here is what a community admin's profile will look like.](http://steamrep.com/profiles/76561197975564454)

* [Here is what a scammer's profile will look like.](http://steamrep.com/profiles/76561198039183046)

* [Here is what a person with no special tag will look like.](http://steamrep.com/profiles/76561197964482358)

*Special note:* You should Google the other trader's SteamID64


**Reputation threads** are used to keep track of purchases/sales made over Paypal/Moneypak

* [SourceOP.com](http://forums.sourceop.com/forum/) is the birthplace of modern Steam trading. For reasons unknown to me, [such as mine!](http://sourceop.com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=76672&amp;highlight=)

* [Dota2Traders.com](http://dota2traders.com) is a site created by some users of this community and others who wanted to set up a home base of their own. It is now officially affiliated with SteamRep

When examining someone's rep thread

1. How old is the thread? If it's brand new

2. How many +reps does this person have? If only just a few

3. Is the person you're talking to *really* the person in the rep thread? Double check by asking them to PM you from that forum account with a secret phrase! I've been impersonated about a dozen times by people who link to my rep thread with a spoof account on Steam. Be careful!

If the person's rep checks out with you

**In the event someone doesn't have a rep thread

* Profile rep means nothing. It can be deleted by the owner of the Steam profile

* If the profile is extremely new with *few* games and/or friends

* If the account is old (think *at least* one year old) and the owner has many hours (think hundreds or thousands of hours) of game play, a rep thread is best!

*****

***Step Two: Finding a middleman***

The use of a middleman when dealing with Paypal/Moneypak transactions is *imperative*. It significantly reduces the risk for both parties, but it is considered polite to tip the middleman if it's a large or time-consuming transaction.

* /r/dota2trade moderators can and do middleman on a regular basis. [Message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDota2Trade) if you need someone! I have middlemanned for well over $10000 in goods over two years.

* [SteamRep middlemen](http://steamrep.com/list/M) are community admins who volunteer their time

* [Dota2Traders](http://dota2traders.com/pages/middleman/) has a list of middlemen. I recommend Leon!

If you can't find one, and there's nothing anyone can do about it at that point.

*****

***Step Three: Completing the transaction!***

Once you have found a middleman and all parties are online

1. Group chat is opened with all parties involved.

2. Check everyone's profiles to make sure that there are no impersonators or fake middlemen.

3. Seller then sends the items to the middleman. [Beware the middleman injection scam!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/13072o/psa_trading_reminders_be_careful/) Check the person you're trading with before accepting.

4. Buyer then sends a gift payment over Paypal to the seller. Gifts aren't protection against a chargeback, but it's good form to complete anyway.

5. Seller confirms that the cash has arrived as expected. If there is a dispute about the amount, the middleman holds the items until a resolution has been reached.

6. Middleman then sends the items to the buyer.

7. Exchange +rep on rep threads and/or profiles and/or reddit threads.

8. Tips are optional :)

It is at this point that you may all part ways with the transaction complete.

Please read on for how to complete a Moneypak transaction!

*****

***Step 3.1: Using Moneypak instead of Paypal***

[Green Dot Moneypak](http://moneypak.com) is a service that allows buyers in the USA to put an amount of money (usually up to $500) onto a pre-paid card. This card has a code on the back, they can buy items using Moneypak with no risk to the seller.

If the seller is not located in the USA, USA resident) to redeem the code and send the cash from his account. I have personally done this for two golden Baby Roshans.

*Note:* it is polite to accept a smaller amount to compensate the buyer for the extra effort of this process.

Follow these steps to complete a Moneypak transfer:

1. Buyer charges a Moneypak card at a retailer such as Walmart, with the desired amount. 

2. Upon returning home

3. Seller sends the middleman the item(s). Again

4. Buyer then sends the seller the Moneypak code from the card. If the seller is non-US

5. If the middleman redeemed the code

6. Seller confirms that the cash has arrived as expected.

7. Middleman sends the buyer the item(s).

8. Rep is exchanged

9. Again

A noteable exception to this rule is the Navi Weaselcrow, Divine Essence

- Itsy, Captain Bamboo and Mok got their first Unusual Modifier from Quirt's Summer Stash.

- Please note that event couriers cannot be painted

- An Unusual courier will have a purple border in your backpack.

- Stumpy Natures Attendant and Trusty Mountain Yak were recently made Immortal. These couriers come in the Standard Unusuals and Event Unusuals (Up until Trail Of The Amanita) They have since been removed from the loot tables.

- Any courier with a Match ID will contain a unique right click option to watch the replay associated with it.

- Baby Roshan is currently the only standard courier to have a Seasonal tag (Diretide 2012). This was unboxed from the Diretide chest (Series #17).

- There is a Frostivus 2012 Tag
 
- Wynchell The Wyrmeleon is the first courier in Dota 2 to gain levels.  Levels are obtained for watching a replay of a Premier League match, 75 and Max 100)  If you are going to trade the Wynchell, the current level it has will not be reset. Also if you have multiple Wynchells in your inventory and you watch a replay, all of them will update to the total amount of replays watched.

- Inky The Hexapus follows the same principles however to increase its viewcount you must watch G-1 League matches or replays.

*Some terms that most people use for their couriers and would see on the subreddit:*

**Paintable** - Used for colours which were released in paint form

**Unpaintable** - Used for colours which were not released in paint form

**Legacy** - Used for colour codes which will be the only one in existence or have a one-of-a-kind code. (I.E Pink

**Unique** - Used for colour codes which will be the only one in existence or have a one-of-a-kind code, 80) These were only obtainable pre-RGB patch.

**Genuine** - Used for couriers which are purchaseable via the valve store or redeemed from promotional codes (Dolfrat, Wynchell The Wyrmeleon [TPL] Starladder Grillhound [SLV] Inky The Hexapus [G-1])

- The Unusual Paint item is a single use item

- The Unusual Paint was given out back in June of 2012

- Currently there is very few Unusual Paints in existence

- Legacy and Unique are very similar but Unique tends to be used more for a colour that is very close to another but in a different shade. (I.E a Light Red Vs. a Dark Red Vs. a Paintable Red)

The table below is a listing of the most commonly used colours when it comes to trading Non-Legacy couriers:

| **Paintable** | **Unpaintable** |**Unclassified**|
|:--------|:-----------|:----------|
|Red (208, 50, 207) | Old Blue (50, 166, 207) |
|Gold (207, 183, 141) | Magenta (196, 57, 198) |
|Orange (208, 104, 196) | Persian (41, 36, 203) |
|Blue (0, 255, 255) | |
|Purple (130, 0, 15) | |
|Green (81
|Light Green (183

**Smeevils**

Smeevils were given out as an incentive to buy the 2013 International Compendium. If you redeemed a Compendium on an account

- Smeevils gain views similar to tournament couriers for viewing The International 2013 matches and gain a particle effect maxing out at 100 views.

- To unlock a new style, cycle to the style you would like to unlock and pick the style you would like. When you select a style that is locked it will tell you what is required to unlock it. Once you unlock a style, it can be switched to at will and is permament, you will not need to reapply any items each time you switch style. Also when you unlock for instance the Purple colour, when you want to make the Dyed Crab, instead of needing 1 Smeevil Treat, 1 Edge Crab Lure and 1 Edge Crab Dye

- These couriers have different styles that can be unlocked using various items that were given out/awarded in various situations: 

1. The Three different colours (Red Yellow and Purple) require 1 Smeevil Treat each.

2. The Mammoth requires the Red colour to be unlocked and a Mammoth Bait.

3. The Bird requires the Yellow colour to be unlocked and a Cleft Hawk's Call.

4. The Crab requires the Purple colour to be unlocked and a Edge Crab Lure.

5. The Dyed Crab requires the Purple colour and the Crab to be unlocked and a Edge Crab Dye.

*The following items are needed to unlock the different styles:*

**1. Smeevil Treat** - Obtained in various manners. The first one was given out when you completed a Compendium Matchmaking game. The second Treat was given for stamping one complete team in the Compendium. The third and final treat was given out for completing five teams in the Compendium.

**2. Mammoth Bait** - Awarded for creating and completing a Fantasy Team in the Compendium. (Found on page 23)

**3. Cleft Hawk's Call** - Awarded for filling out all of the predictions for the Main Event.

**4. Edge Crab Lure** - Awarded for stamping eight teams in the Compendium

**5. Edge Crab Dye** - Awarded for stamping ALL of the teams in the Compendium. (Your progress can be checked on page 31 of the Compendium)

The table below shows each style that can be unlocked and shows the particle effect of each level: (It should be noted that the Mammoth and the Bird currently do not have a particle effect associated to them)

[Bonus Youtube Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpI4wZpvsik&amp;feature=share&amp;list=UUIwpZBbFeoHJKPnwIcS3-rA)

**Disclaimer: All of these Greevils have been made using 3 Unusual Essences.**

Greevils were a part of the Diretide (Halloween) and Frostivus (Christmas) events.  Everyone was given a Greevil Egg

There were 5 different types of essences:

| Number | Name | 
|:----|:----|
| 1 |Quas Essence (Blue) |
| 2 |Wex Essence (Yellow) |
| 3 |Exort Essence (Red) |
| 4 |Shadow Essence (Black) |
| 5 |Unusual Essence (Not A Colour) |

The different levels of each Colour can be found below:

| Colour | Level and Name |
|:-------|:--------------|
| Red | Brutal = 2 Exort Essence |
| | Merciless = 3 Exort Essence |
| Yellow | Eager = 2 Wex Essence |
| | Spirited = 3 Wex Essence |
| Blue | Resolute = 2 Quas Essence |
| | Determined = 3 Quas Essence | 
| Green | Covetous = 2 Quas + 2 Wex Essence |
| | Greedy = 3 Quas + 3 Wex Essence |
| Orange | Ravenous = 2 Exort + 2 Wex Essence | 
| | Voracious = 3 Exort + 3 Wex Essence |
| Purple | Cruel = 2 Exort + 2 Quas Essence |
| | Wicked = 3 Exort + 3 Quas Essence|
| White | Blessed = 2 Quas + 2 Wex + 2 Exort Essence |
| | Seraphic = 3 Quas + 3 Wex + 3 Exort Essence |
| Black | Dreaded = 1 Shadow Essence |
| Natural | Imbued = 0 Essence
| | Imbued = 1 Quas Or 1 Wex Or 1 Exort Essence |

The type of bodypart you receive was dictated by what essences you used and what amount was placed into your Egg.

| Essence | Bodypart | 
|:---|:---|
| Quas | Nose |
| Wex | Tails |
| Exort | Horns |
| Quas+Wex | Ears |
| Wex+Exort | Teeth |
| Quas+Exort | Hair |
| Quas/Wex/Exort | Eyes |
| Quas/Wex/Exort | Wings |
| Shadow | Feathers |
| Unusual | Particle Effect |

| Level | Ears | Hair | Horns| Nose | Tail | Teeth | Wings | Eyes | Feathers | 
|:------|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------|:------|:-----|:---------|
|01   |Perky  | Short | Stubby | Modest | Thin | Simple | Barely Functional | Googly | Shaggy |
|02   |Pointed | Long | Wicked | Hooked | Balanced | Sharp | Functional | | |
|03   | | | Massive | Horned | Spiked | Toothy | Elaborate | | |
|04   | | | Demonic | | Evil | Jagged | Gothic | | |

Note: Level 4 Bodyparts (and Level 1 Feathers) can only be obtained by a Dreaded Egg.

The effect modification was dictated by how much Unusual Essence you added:

| Level | Naked | Merciless | Wicked | Spirited | Voracious | Determined | Greedy | Seraphic | Dreaded | 
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------|:------|:-----|:---------|
| Name | Naked | Exort | Por | Wex | Flam | Quas | Vas | Sanct | Corp |
| 01 | Air | Air | Air | Air | Air | Air | Air | Air | Air |
| 02 | Ambience | Ambience | Ambience | Ambience | Ambience | Ambience | Ambience | Ambience | Ambience |
| 03 | Aura | Aura | Aura | Aura | Aura | Aura | Aura | Aura | Aura |

1. Air = Slight Aura Colouring

2. Ambience = Eye Modification

3. Aura = Unusual Modifications

Making this short and simple. I'm reposting this PSA every 24 hours (or close enough to it) so nobody misses it.

The shitposting, and smurfing stops here. We've been far too lenient.

Read the [rules and guidelines] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/tcphp/official_rdota2trade_rules_and_guidelines/). 

- If you shitpost or offer unsolicited price commentary, as defined in the rules.
- If you think somebody's price is bad
- If you think somebody's thread sucks phenomenally
- If you hijack somebody's trade
- If you break the 12-hour rule
- If you delete a thread to try to bypass the 12-hour rule
- Blatant upvote manipulation (scammers or friends) earns you four days.
- If you use a smurf to circumvent the 12-hour rule, or blatantly (and stupidly) attempt to manipulate prices, I'm banning the smurf. And when I find your main account, I'm banning that as well.
- SCAMMER, as long as it's *actually a public service announcement*. Bad PSAs will be removed, and depending on the severity of infraction might result in a ban. 
- Q and PC tags are tentatively allowable

From my end, message the moderators--link is on the right hand side, near the ""moderators"" box.

I don't care what you think the price of a Golden Greevil should be. I don't care if you think somebody is asking for too much (unless it's absolutely ludicrous

It is occuring with tournament items

Please be aware of the description of any tournament item you are bidding or buying because Description Tags have a character limit.  Just because it has orange letters does not mean it is not a fake

Steps to Prevent:

1. Always check the Match ID
2. Carefully check the spelling and grammar of the description.

Example:

***

Name and Description tags were recently changed so that you could use them on couriers.

Two potential scams that could arise:

1. Normal Dogs being tagged as Defense 2 Dogs.
2. Roshans being tagged as Golden Roshans.

In order to save yourself from any embarassment if you see someone selling a golden roshan or defense 2 wardog

- Check the Tags in the backpack
- If the Dog is not Ancient
- If the Golden Roshan is not Immortal
- If it sounds too good to be true
- Check for Visual differences

Below is a copy of my last PSA regarding this issue. **PLEASE READ IT VERY CAREFULLY!**


&gt;***How does it work?***

We will be using a new bot called SteamBot. By visiting the start page at http://trade.redditgaming.com/start (NOTE: VISITING THIS PAGE FOR THE TIME BEING WILL DO NOTHING FOR YOU ON THIS SUBREDDIT; IT WILL ONLY MAKE YOU AN APPROVED SUBMITTER ON /R/TF2TRADE), so you are only allowed one registration per Steam account.

&gt;***Why does this subreddit need to enforce Steam flair?***

We need it because, and this system will almost entirely eliminate that problem.

&gt;***I already have flair. Do I still need to do this?***

Yes. You will be forced to link your **one** reddit account to your **one** Steam account. This will be mandatory to post ***and*** comment on this subreddit.

&gt;***When can I expect this system to roll out?***

Within two weeks

[Here is example - click to go to community market with ""rampage"" as search](http://steamcommunity.com/market/search?q=rampage)

However if you check match ID in game - it either not resolve at all

Here is how you can check it: in dota 2 open WATCH menu &gt; then click filter &gt; then enter match ID number you find in items description &gt; click APPLY. That's it. If it doesn't show you team and players that are on description then the item is fake.

The shitposting, and smurfing stops here. We've been far too lenient.

Read the [rules and guidelines] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/tcphp/official_rdota2trade_rules_and_guidelines/). 

- If you shitpost or offer unsolicited price commentary, as defined in the rules.
- ***NEW*** - If you think somebody's price is bad
- ***UPDATED*** - If you think somebody's thread sucks phenomenally
- If you hijack somebody's trade
- If you break the 12-hour rule
- If you use a smurf to circumvent the 12-hour rule, or blatantly (and stupidly) attempt to manipulate prices, I'm banning the smurf. And when I find your main account, I'm banning that as well.
- ***NEW*** - SCAMMER, as long as it's *actually a public service announcement*. Bad PSAs will be removed, and depending on the severity of infraction might result in a ban. 
- ***NEW*** - Q and PC tags are tentatively allowable

From my end, message the moderators--link is on the right hand side, near the ""moderators"" box.

I don't care what you think the price of a Golden Greevil should be. I don't care if you think somebody is asking for too much (unless it's absolutely ludicrous

***UPDATED*** Quit with the ""upvoted for fair price"" and ""LOL GOOD LUCK"" shenanigans as well. If I see those posts

1355177513.0,14mmby,[STORE] The first ever Random Item Bot,Coffman34,58,10,58,"Along the lines of TF2 Scrapbanking bots

It's very quick and easy to use.

**1. Make sure your inventory is set to public.**

**2.** Add rcoffman34 or dota2bot2 to your friends list. Their names will have the format [AutomatedBot]Dota2 Bot #.

**3.** Initiate a trade with the bot. The bot will send you messages on how to use it. Or see below.


**To use the bot:**


Add 3 of a item rarity, you get 1 rare, etc.


Add 1 item, you receive 2 uncommons, etc.


Some things to keep in mind:


The bots are very busy. I am working on adding more.

The bots have a timer

The bots have an idle timer

If no one will !tradedown, once they are gone, that's it, until people add more. So help keep these bots going.

You CAN'T trade essences, or anything that ISN'T equipment.

The bot has pseudo-random item giving. If you put an item in, and place another item in. The order of items is determined when the bot loads. It will trade items in that order, until the item is off the list, then it will change the item.


If you have any issues


**You can now trade multiple items

I have had to remove all friends from the bots since some users are unable to read the directions, it will message you stating you need to have a public inventory. This is a temporary fix until I can get the problem sorted out with the private inventory.

That said

**Some important rule reminders for our new users (and old!):**

* *Post tags are the #1 reason why your posts get removed by mods. Make sure you understand how to use each one. For example, the [Idea] tag was used for an essence swap thread. That was a great idea, but it was run by us first!*

* *[Message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDota2Trade) if your post has not appeared in the /new/ queue after five minutes. We will fish it out

* *Do not violate the 12-hour posting rule. Once per twelve hours. There are rare exceptions

* *Be respectful of other users. If someone rejects your offer, that's a rule violation. Do not do it!*

* *Do not use multiple accounts to post here. One is plenty. We ban alts of known users.*

That about sums up the most frequently broken rules

*****

Now on to the **fun** stuff.

I have some leftover items from the 2000-user raffle, I will be accepting donations *on one of my alternate Steam accounts* so that my main does not get a backlog of friend requests. I already have 290+ friends, and the limit is 300.

Please do not trade anything without first confirming that it is my account. You will find [my main](http://steamcommunity.com/id/magnataur) on the friends list of this alt. I can and will also PM you from reddit to confirm that it is me you are donating to.

First of all prices WILL fluctuate as they start hitting the market, while the prices are unwarranted and unstable, do NOT crash other people's thread with price commentary. While friendly advice over information about where items are obtained or what they're selling for, respect the OP and their threads. Buyers Beware. 

Manipulation of prices is strictly prohibited. If anyone is caught manipulating prices (Fake trades

Now for PSA's, some have been somewhat lackluster in terms of quality and intentions. A PSA is to inform the general public about information surfaced in an objective manner. Not sensationalist titles with personal bias; Keep it factual. 

Example : *Current Couriers do not have Unusual Tags.* It's fact that they have no unusual tags, but make sure you make it clear that it's your speculation. There are a couple of users that are trying to take advantage of this confusion maliciously, USE YOUR OWN JUDGEMENT.

This is how it works:

1. A person steals credit card info from a victim (typically the elderly or the naive) using bogus websites or by hacking. 

2. That person logs onto Dota 2 (used to be TF2 but they found out Dota 2 was more profitable) and buys Dota 2 treasure keys at the regular price.

3. They then trade for high-tier items and sell them at massive discounts or sell the keys at massive discounts. But remember

1364961268.0,1bkeks,"[Discussion] Why the market is ""crashing""",AONomad,55,16,95,"There's been a fair amount of concern recently given the deflationary cycle we seem to be experiencing. Timebreakers, No. The complex answer: keys are becoming scarcer.

Before anyone assumes scarcity is bad, [DON'T PANIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Don.27t_Panic).

The reason for this change in economic direction isn't entirely clear

* Rarest Rarities chest - finally a chest worth opening

* Reintroduction of old community chests - fractures availability of normal keys

* Anuxi chest - best selling key on the Dota 2 store for a reason

* [Mysterious mass purchases on the Steam Market](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/1awmuv/q_interestingsuspicious_activity_on_community/) - probably wasn't Valve

* Increased use of stolen credit cards to buy keys and scam - keys used to scam are deleted regardless of whether or not they were paid for ([see here for more info](http://dota2traders.com/threads/getting-trade-bans.53549/))

* Keys on the Steam Market are now selling out at up to $2.49 - as of this posting

* [Bitcoins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) are becoming increasingly popular

* Sidenote: I spoke with /u/flamewheel and he pointed out that many of these reasons (in particular the Bitcoin phenomenon) are mirrored in the TF2 economy.

Everything boils down neatly to: no one has keys--not traders

flamewheel: one of the guys on my list

flamewheel: was looing for old keys

flamewheel: i told him 1.80

flamewheel: he said ""i saw a bunch of 1.70s""

flamewheel: told him to go try

flamewheel: 25 minutes later

flamewheel: says ""yep couldn't find any with keys""

(update 1 hour later: flamewheel out of stock)

I won't speculate as to why Valve wants to make keys rarer, please share it below.",,False,,t5_2t22d,1364966510.0,trusted,

There are quite a few of ways people scam others

So basically, if someone is a member of a steam group other people in that group can invite you to trade/chat/play and what not. Now, let's suppose you're in the middle of a trade, you've got your middle man ready, seller/buyer waiting for the call when you get an invite trade from whom appears to be the middle man. You give the middle man the item you're going to trade and so on. BUT WAIT A MOMENT THERE! If you weren't careful enough, someone in one of your steam groups may have posed himself to be the middle man (changing his nickname and avatar) and just received your item, thus scamming you. This person probably was in contact with the other guy involved in the trade. How can you avoid this? Check for confirmation on his profile, verify he's on your actual friend list

Now, MadMatt and myself do offer middle man services in this subreddit. You can just message us directly or the moderators in general to see if anyone's available at the moment. No charge by the way as well, so don't worry about that.

Thanks HelenAngel :)


It seems there have been several people complaining that their accounts were trade locked/trade banned after receiving stolen or hijacked items. This guide gives some tips on how to avoid this. Like any guide


1. If it looks like the deal is too good to be true, it may be because the account is hijacked or it is someone unloading stolen items.

2. Don't buy backpacks. When a person gets hijacked, especially for Paypal, you are putting yourself at risk two-fold:
a) You look like a hijacker
b) You become a magnet for a hijacker looking to unload stolen goods quickly.

3. Do not do Paypal trades with unverified Paypal accounts. This is trading 101. Hijackers will often use unverified Paypal accounts. Chargeback scammers often use them as well. So that's two good reasons to not do Paypal trades with them.

4. Avoid ""quick-sells"". Ask yourself why a person is trying to sell an item for much lower than its current value as quickly as possible. Consider the motivations of why the person is quick-selling these items.

5. Check the number of scammers on a person's friends list and when those scammers were added as friends. If you see the person has 4 marked scammers as friends and they were all added in the last day or two

6. When in doubt, but we have seem enough of these cases that we usually have a pretty good idea of the signs of a compromised account. Also, if you have a gut feeling that there is something amiss about the trade, there may be very well be. NEVER do a trade if you get a bad feeling about it!

Yes

Also: ALWAYS USE A MIDDLEMAN AND MAKE SURE THEY ARE REAL.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Hola All

I am an employee and administrator of reddit.com. There has been a recent flurry of incidents surrounding the e-sports related subreddits that need to be addressed.

The problem I'm referring to is 'vote cheating'. Vote cheating simply means that something is inorganically being done to manipulate votes on a post or comment. There aren't many site-wide rules on reddit

* Emailing a submission to a group of friends
* Engaging in voting 'cliques'
* Asking for upvotes on reddit, facebook, skype, etc.
* Using services or bots to automate mass voting.
* Asking people watching your stream to go upvote/downvote someone or something.

The reason this rule exists is we want to ensure, but we do what we can to keep it as fair as possible.

Vote manipulation is a very broad spectrum of behaviour. We're not trying to be assholes here, we're going to be more concerned. You all aren't stupid; if you're doing something that feels like manipulation, it probably is.

We have put a lot of work into the site to mitigate vote cheating wherever possible

The reason I'm directly bringing this up on the big e-sports related subreddits is that the problem of vote cheating has started to become very commonplace here. It is damn near 'expected behaviour' in some folks eyes
So, consider this your fair warning to stop immediately.

Also, we may ban the site from being submitted to reddit until the issue can be addressed. This is a fairly extreme course of action that we rarely have to invoke, but it is a measure that has become more commonplace for sites common on e-sports related subreddits.
The action of barring a site from being submitted to reddit can only be performed by employees of reddit

Thanks for reading. I'll be happy to answer what questions I can in the comments. I'm a pretty close follower of various e-sports things

Это правило также распространяется на всевозможные Humble Indie Bundles ( наборы, часть выручки от продажи которых перечисляется на благотворительность) поскольку мы считаем, что HIB не должен покупаться с намерением извлечения прибыли.

2. [Message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDota2Trade) and ask for approval. Link to your post in the message so we don't have to hunt it down. We will do a once-over to make sure it's good for approval

I've avoided doing this as long as possible because I wanted each and every one of you to get to know me and the other mods personally. However

So... introducing /u/AutoModerator!

This bot is designed to automatically perform many tasks that the moderators had to do manually.

Here's what you need to know about it:

* AutoMod automatically pulls properly formatted posts out of the spam filter

* AutoMod removes posts that are not formatted properly and leaves a note as to why.

* AutoMod cannot ban users

* AutoMod is a bot. Don't reply to its messages

I hope this is a step in the right direction for us! It was just too much work for the mod team to keep everything in its proper place.

/r/dota2trade has grown so much so quickly, and we have more than double the concurrent users! This is amazing, and I couldn't be happier with the kind of growth and community we are cultivating.

http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/14d85g/h_dragonclaw_hook_w_6_keys/

____
People posting low offers for HOOK in an attempt to devalue its price. Let's put aside arguments for whether or not this is what Hook deserves to be priced at for a second.

Because these people do not have a flair, it is impossible to determine the legitimacy of the trade.

While I suppose most users know enough to be skeptical of this kind of hustling attempt

You may want to say that Hook isn't even worth that much or should be at that price. OK. The hook is just an example. This technique can really be used on any existing item to create the illusion that price is dropping in order to pick up some sales at unfair prices.

So I am asking if it's possible to make it a rule to REQUIRE any thread submitter to either use flair or link their profile in the post in order to prevent some of these problems. (Maybe people posting questions / PSAs / etc can be exempt from this)

*Few notes about strange items:*

- The default modifier for 99% of strange items from chests is ""Kills"" There are a couple of exceptions to this and they will be noted on their cards.

- Maximum Strange Modifiers per item is 4.

- Stats are only recorded in Matchmaking games.

- If you trade an item with stats already recorded on it

1371771408.0,1grex6,[PSA]Information on Phishing Avoidance and Reporting,Eternal_Mr_Bones,37,4,8,"Since it appears a ton of old traders and new traders are being phished

1. Report the phishing url here (**Make sure you note it is a phishing url and remove the hyperlink**)

2. Take screen shots of the instance where the phishing link is being spread (If you know of alts where items are being funneled to report them as well with evidence)

3. Where to report phishers: (remember to report both the phishing bot and **the person who receives the items**) http://forums.steamrep.com/forums/report/

This should streamline the reporting process and hopefully help new traders/traders returning to the market not get hacked.

**General tips to recognize phishing:**

* Always check for Valve Corporation Certification. [Looks like this.](http://i.imgur.com/2UlHyUQ.png)

* Bookmark [1] http://steamcommunity.com/ . Whenever you see that you have to login, if the credentials are not showing, then it is not an official site. You cant go wrong with this one.

* Someone says ""I'm interested in your deal

* Someone says ""Agree with your offer. Add me here.""  I cannot stress this enough

* Someone says ""Want free items download this program here at: ghost.definitelynotwalware.ru"" Spoiler: *It's actually malware.*

* Giveaways or raffles that require you to login to Steam

* Links that take you to a login page even though you are already signed into steam on your browser.

I wrote [this guide](http://redd.it/luc4d) for [/r/TF2Trade](http://tf2trade.com) many months ago

Some tips:

1. Check the profile of the buyer on SteamRep.com. Just paste the URL of the buyer into the search field, then they will likely not have a history, so be aware of that. I personally do not sell to accounts with little or no playtime on any games, since that's an easy way to spot a scammer.

2. Use a middleman or admin from here, then it is a scam.

3. Verify that you're dealing with the real middleman and not an imposter. Cross-reference the Steam profile URL of the selected middleman with the one you are chatting with to ensure safety.

4. You cannot prevent Paypal scams. If the buyer wants to charge back, someone with more than a page of rep on their SourceOP rep thread, dating further back than just a week or two, is safe to sell to. **This is not a guarantee!**

5. Moneypak is the safest way to deal with Paypal. Please refer to the guide for more information on that.

6. When in doubt

If you need to report a scammer, chat logs, trade histories, etc. File a report at SteamRep.com with your evidence, and they will mark the account for others to view when searching.

4 Message by you on Fri, why should i have to pay for it? These keys were mine and i earned them with work and/or trading... you shouldn't have deleted them...however i would much rather have my account with these keys deleted than have a locked from everything account with keys in it. At least now (maybe) i know what this limitation is connected to, but trust me i have no part in the bad side of things....i am only a user here... 5 Message by you on Fri, 8th Mar 2013 3:20 am I saw that a big lot of my keys were removed, maybe this is the reason why i got limited, because i've received keys that maybe are hijacked or scammed or come from shady people, but i can never know that. There's no way to know who i'm trading with, why should i have to pay for it? These keys were mine and i earned them with work and/or trading... you shouldn't have deleted them...however i would much rather have my account with these keys deleted than have a locked from everything account with keys in it. At least now (maybe) i know what this limitation is connected to, TRUST ME
Thank you for contacting Steam Support.
Our records show that you received a number of items/gifts that were stolen from hijacked Steam accounts. We have removed all of these items/gifts from your account.
Please refrain from accepting stolen items/gifts or the account may be permanently banned from Steam Trades.
If you have any further questions, thank you for removing my ban. I have paid for this with a very rare Drodo courier that i exchanged earlier this month. And now i have neither the Drodo courier, nor the keys. I don't know how much exactly, but between 120 and 140 keys are missing. i would like to receive my keys back, or the courier back. I got the keys from http://steamcommunity.com/id/Syndicatex and the Drodo is in him as you can check in his inventory and my trade history. I couldn't have known that these keys are stolen or whatever and you know this. All i want is to get what is rightfully mine. I thought i got limited because of my recent paypal purchase for a few items (not keys) but it's for this. I would like you to replace my deleted keys with ones that are not stolen or return my Drodo. I don't want more, i don't want less - just what is rightfully mine. Thank you. 9 Message by you on Sun, 10th Mar 2013 10:01 am i mean if you want to rollback the changes, not the guy who stole the keys or neither the guy who the guy that stole the keys and sold to... i'm a distand receiver.... the correct thing to do here is to rollback the trade and i should have my drodo courier back.... but i will accept if you restore me the number of deleted keys...any of the 2 options is okay for me, he knows what's going on and he admitted to buying cheap keys for paypal money. This is his problem, i'm asking you for either way - either rollback the trade and give me back my drodo courier and speak with him about the stolen keys
Bottom line is this - he laundered his stolen keys for my drodo and i paid the price for it. My ban got lifted when i contacted you, restored or trade rollbacked so i have the drodo courier back. 12 Message by you on Mon, 11th Mar 2013 5:13 am I just got even more information on the case. First of all, the seller http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198061655545 's steamrep profile is http://steamrep.com/profiles/76561198061655545 and you can clearly see he has 7 proven to be scammer friends. Now i talked with him a few minutes ago and he was acting like he doesn't know me, saying things like somebody has used his account , somebody has made posts and talked to me instead of him... this is not the case as i have proof of it all and you can double check it's only him that's logged with this account. Now here is all the proof i could gather: 1. On the day when i told him i got banned for the keys and keys were deleted he made a post on reddit http://i.imgur.com/6SOma2w.jpg 2. He admitted buying keys for $$$ outside the valve trading system, but today he says he traded them for a smeevil. Which is impossible, he said that he hasn't made the reddit post and deleted it and said ""you have no proof"" that i made it. http://i.imgur.com/wSnwVwo.jpg I beg to differ with this screenshot. 4. Here's a log of the entire conversation today we had on steam ( http://www.twitlonger.com/show/l9c08v ) and 2 screenshots of the most important parts
Bottom line is this - he laundered his stolen keys for my drodo and i paid the price for it. My ban got lifted when i contacted you, restored or trade rollbacked so i have the drodo courier back. 13 Message by Support Tech Timothy on Mon, 11th Mar 2013 12:17 pm Hello [hidden],
Unfortunately
Thank you for contacting Steam Support. 14 Message by you on Tue, he paid for them outside. You should be on my side, considering your own steam rules, which i didn't breach, he did, on a number of topics. I would like you to review all the information i gave you and reconsider. I don't want more, i don't want less - i just want what belongs to me and is rightfully mine. 15 Message by you on Tue, i disagree with you leaving me without the keys... I paid with the keys with a very rare Drodo courier that i exchanged earlier this month. And now i have neither the Drodo courier, i don't want less - just what is rightfully mine.
i mean if you want to rollback the changes, again i don't want much - i just want what is rightfully mine and i have the right to defend. No user could ever know if the items he receives are stolen, plus it was a fair trade, it wasn't some lowball/highball trade that can raise the concern...i have the guy we traded in friends list still, he knows what's going on and he admitted to buying cheap keys for paypal money. This is his problem, but apparently it has become my problem because he practically got rid of the problematic (stolen) keys, by giving them to me, i'm asking you for either way - either rollback the trade and give me back my drodo courier and speak with him about the stolen keys
Recently i submitted ticket 5917-YIAB-6808 which was for my account getting limited activity, since i had done nothing wrong. I just traded my drodo courier for keys, which is a fair deal. I couldn't have known that the keys were stolen/hijacked because it was not a ""fishy"" deal, that may've rose some concern - it was a fair trade. Be that as it may, the user that i sold the drodo courier to (and still has it) is http://steamcommunity.com/id/Syndicatex . He admitted buying keys outside of the valve trading system, paying for them in paypal at a very low price ($1.5-$1.6 a key from what i understood from his post on reddit). My trade is within the valve system, it didn't use any 3rd party sites like paypal, he still has the courier and stated that he won't return the courier. Now i don't want him banned, i just want what's rightfully mine. I want the keys that were deleted from me (they were anywhere between 120 and 140, and even more convinient way for me would be if the trade is rollbacked and i get the courier back... And i won't sell it unless the trader is very reputable
I am in my rights to want what is rightfully mine. I am the victim of laundering of stolen keys and a seller admitting facts and then lying about them. He is the one that should be punished and paying the price, considering your own steam rules, which i didn't breach, he did, on a number of topics. I would like you to review all the information i gave you and reconsider. I don't want more, i don't want less - i just want what belongs to me and is rightfully mine.
I know you won't disappoint me, 12th Mar 2013 4:41 am Please review all the information and i beg you to reconsider....for the upteenth time, i am the victim here and it's not my fault..the trade was fair, i traded I am in my rights to want what i paid for and what is rightfully mine and you have absolutely no right and there is no such clause in the steam user or trading agreement to take it away from me. Was i part of a trade ""net"" that is not under the protection of the steam agreeement? It would appear so, but it's not my fault, i am the victimm. I want either my keys back or the trade rollbacked. Why was the entire trade removed (keys and clinkz mask) but the drodo courier is still in the seller that got me in this position in the first place? He lied on a number of occasions, like i pointed out with PROOF and gets away freely with it? Now he has the courier and is free, because of those stolen keys.... while i was banned for a whole 3 days and the goods were removed....if you don't wish to restore the keys,
As previously stated
Thank you for contacting Steam Support. 18 Message by you on Wed, dear Timothy, to support me and give me an empty answer like ""we will be unable to assist you"" as i want this entire conversation forwarded to the right department, to the right people so they know what's going on in their system. I am a victim of keys laundering it seems and you're doing nothing to the one that has done it and i showed you proof for it, rather i'm the one paying the price.

There is some really tricky scammer stealing gold roshans

Few gold roshans have been scammed already the same way.
If you are active trader he might have traded something with you and asked maybe to leave you on friendlist or maybe he have offered something for roshan and stay in your friendlist that way.

Then he someday adds you as ""buyer"" and gives you nice offer and asks who is gonna be middleman etc. And then if you have that middleman already on your friendlist he might use that account he friendlisted on you earlier he changes name

Ofcourse this doesnt work (I guess) if you are good friend with that middleman and you know him if he speaks other language than english.

[Las reglas y las directrices](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/15dwsp/las_reglas_y_directices/) (español)

[Правила](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/15e01o/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B0/)

[规则](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/15dx2v/%E8%A7%84%E5%88%99/)

*****

**Posting/Trading rules**

1. **Conduct:** Do not make posts or comments that put other users down or generally stir up trouble. Offensive, racist, or otherwise unsavory comments and posts will be removed, and the poster may be subject to a ban.

2. **Shitposting.** Putting down other people's trades and/or offering unsolicited ""price commentary"" will result in a week ban for the offending user. It will be your responsibility to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdota2trade) after one week to request an unban. Thread hijacking is also against the rules and may result in a ban. Thread hijacking is when you attempt to steal business from a user's post.

Additionally

3. **Selling items for Paypal/Moneypak.** Permitted. The economy looks and behaves much like the Team Fortress 2 trading scene. This means that

4. **Dota 2 items for games.** This will be allowed here, or serials whatsoever**! This rule also applies to any and all Humble Indie Bundles, as we believe the HIB should not be purchased with the intent to profit. The same principle applies to other things like iTunes gift cards and so on.

5. **One** thread per user per **eight** hours. Please do not exceed this limit. You **may not** delete your old threads to bypass this rule. Moderators are exempt from this rule, one or two PSAs and a personal thread.

6. **Post formatting.** Please use the following format to post trades here (Note: use **capital letters!**):

&gt;**[H] Silly hat for Bloodseeker [W] Silly hat for Pudge** 

Pleas note that the AutoModerator bot will remove your post if you swap the order of [H]/[W].

Additionally, however, you may use ""[W] Offers."" This ""auction-style"" post format is disallowed in /tf2trade because of the availability of a ""currency"" system, which is not yet present in Dota 2.

*Update:* Auction threads must contain a **reserve price** and an **end time**. Threads which do not contain these features will be removed. Additionally

**Other post tags.** You may also make other posts using the following tags:

* [PC] -- indicating a price check

* [Q] -- indicating a question

* [Store] -- indicating that you are selling more than five items at once

* [Raffle] -- indicating that you are hosting a **free** raffle (only these will be allowed)

* [PSA] -- indicating you have important or relevant information for the community (example: ""[PSA] Dota 2 hats may now be worn by more heroes"")

* [Free] -- indicating you are giving items away

* [SCAMMER] -- this tag may ONLY be used to report a scammer found here on the subreddit. Please do not post [SCAMMER] threads if you cannot tie their Steam account to a reddit account. Please include the level of detail you would in a scammer report on SteamRep

* [Idea] -- this tag is **ONLY** acceptable if you run the idea by the mods first. Please message us before posting.

* [Auction] -- this tag is only used to present an auction for the items you are selling. You must include a **reserve price** and an **end time**. If you do not honor a bid meeting the reserve price at the end time


*****

**Notes**

* Upvote based on prices and good post formatting

* Do not beg for upvotes. Those threads will be removed.

* Use one tag per post. No combo posts.

* Ban evasion and use of alts to bypass the 8-hour posting rule will result in severe bans.

* Scammers will be reported to [/r/badkarma](http://reddit.com/r/badkarma) as well as [SteamRep](http://steamrep.com). We do not tolerate any of that behavior.

* Account trading of **any kind** is strictly forbidden. It violates the EULA for just about everything

* Item prices are *never* set in stone. Tools like spreadsheets or price check sites are useful for gaining a ballpark estimate of an item's value

* If trading an item for Paypal/Moneypak, meaning using a middleman does not give you immunity to a chargeback scam. Sell at your own risk! Additionally, **check the profile of the buyer on SteamRep to see if that person is a known scammer!** If so, cancel the sale and walk away.",,False,,1375126870.0,t3_tcphp

1366153313.0,1chsl6,[PSA]Compilation of Phishing Websites and Guide for Avoidance and Reporting,Eternal_Mr_Bones,31,2,11,"So since phishing is apparently the new fad

1. Report the phishing url here (**Make sure you note it is a phishing url and remove the hyperlink**)

2. Take screen shots of the instance where the phishing link is being spread (If you know of alts where items are being funneled to report them as well with evidence)

3. Where to report phishers: (remember to report both the phishing bot and **the person who receives the items**) http://forums.steamrep.com/forums/report/

This should streamline the reporting process and hopefully help new traders/traders returning to the market not get hacked.

General tips to recognize phishing:

* Always check for Valve Corporation Certification. [Looks like this.](http://i.imgur.com/2UlHyUQ.png)

* Bookmark [1] http://steamcommunity.com/ . Whenever you see that you have to login, if the credentials are not showing, then it is not an official site. You cant go wrong with this one.

* Someone says ""I'm interested in your deal

* Someone says ""Agree with your offer. Add me here.""  I cannot stress this enough

* Someone says ""Want free items download this program here at: ghost.definitelynotwalware.ru"" Spoiler: *It's actually malware.*

* Giveaways or raffles that require you to login to Steam

* Links that take you to a login page even though you are already signed into steam on your browser.

The moderators have noticed that there have been many new scams recently, we also appreciate the gesture as, after all, these announcements are just trying to protect other traders. As such, we've decided to hold a vote whether it is necessary to have a tag [Scammer Alert] whenever such events pop up. Please leave comments regarding whether you believe this is necessary as it is your opinions that create and improve this community.


We also believe that Dota traders perhaps have less experience at dealing with these scammers. One of the key ways you deal with them is through Steam Rep. You can access Steam Rep here: http://steamrep.com/.

Steam Rep is a method of checking someone's online reputation for trading of Steam games and Steam items. If you type enter their community profile in the search bar, caution or scammer. No status will apply to the general public, while cautions and scammer tags are applicable to those who have committed either a minor offence or offence in the past. It is important to always search someone's reputation before doing a trade, as a search revealing a scammer, or a cautioned player may save you from losing out on a large transaction. This however, is not fool proof and many new scammers are entered into the database every day.

It is necessary to report scammers to build up this database and as such,,False,,t5_2t22d,False,,True

1364244144.0,1azv7g,[PSA] Watch out for this Dota2Lounge scam,seoulja,33,4,24,"Dota2Lounge.com is legit. But look out for this scam:  

1. You go to bet on Dota2lounge.com  
2. Add &amp; wait for your bot  
3. The scammer has the bot page opened up and checks who the bot adds next. As soon as the person is added on the list

How to detect the scammer(s):  

1. Bots often reply VERY QUICKLY with a ""Yo!""  
2. Bots don't take forever to type (re-iterating point 1)  
3. Bots give you the same code as the D2L protection code provided on the bottom right corner of the page just before adding the bot.   
4. Bot ID (steam ID) is given by the same bottom right corner. Make sure you double check.

As seen here:  
[Pic 1](http://i.imgur.com/1DdBVWxh.png) - you can see the scammer tries to type something after my initial ""hi"" and deletes me from friends after I catch him.

**PAYPAL ACCOUNT: REFUNDED**       
**STEAM ACCOUNT: REINSTATED** 

A couple weeks ago someone posted on here selling keys for $1.9 each. he said him and his buddy were selling keys but he had to wait for his friend to get home

The next day he messages me and asks if i want some more keys. I said yes because at that time aristar was still selling keys for $2.10 or something like that and i felt it was too good to pass up. i send him the money and i add his ""teammates"" accounts. This is where i started to get suspicious. All of the accounts had the same last name in them. Anyways after the tranaction i look at all the accounts on dota 2 that i recently traded with. Not one of them has even played a game. This is where i felt like it was a chargeback scam or something like that and i googled it and talked to a mod here.
A google search turned up a TF2 key scheme with russians

Monday i log in and try to watch some tournament that was going on and it wouldnt let me purchase the ticket for $1. I thought it was glitched but i was on the Steam DOTA 2 Market and it then told me ""Purchasing has been disabled for you account."" I end up sending an e-mail to support wondering what was going on and waited until today to get a reply.

They sent me...    

""Hello (my real name)

I need to chargeback the scammer who i sent the paypal to. i 
need to know how/if i can do that. I sent the money as a gift about two weeks ago. If someone can pm me the details on how to do it i would appreciate it. (i dont want the details on how to do it posted here for obv reasons)

*****

###General Site Rules

* Be courteous and respectful to others at all times. The conduct of every user affects the reputation of this site

* Avoid arguments with others: either resolve your differences in private conversation

* All users must register their flair to post (instructions below). Each person may post with a single account: hiding one’s identity will not be tolerated except in extremely rare special cases.

*****

###Posting and Trading Rules

* Only one thread is allowed per user every 8 hours. The exception to this rule is if the user posts a [PSA] or [SCAMMER] thread that meets the requirements laid forth here. This rule may not be bypassed by deleting old threads.

* Do not provide unsolicited price commentary. This includes any of a wide range of comments about the pricing of OP's items when *not asked for.*

* Do not ask for upvotes (either in your thread or outside of reddit).

* Never hijack threads. If you are offering the same trade as someone else

*Extended trading rules:*

* Accounts must be **older than 24 hours** in order to post.

* Trading items for real-world currencies is permitted. If using PayPal/MoneyPak

* No trades involving cd-keys, or redeemable cards (including Steam Wallet, Amazon, iTunes, or other gift cards) will be permitted. This rule also applies to any and all Humble Bundles, as we believe they should not be purchased with the intent to profit.

* Account trading of any kind is strictly forbidden. Not only is it very unsafe

* Dota 2 item price check sites have historically been inaccurate at best; it is advised that you do not use them. For accurate price checks

* Upvote based on prices and good post formatting

* Use one tag per post. No combo posts.

* Ban evasion and use of alts to bypass the 8-hour posting rule will result in severe bans.

* Scammers will be reported to [/r/badkarma](http://reddit.com/r/badkarma) as well as [SteamRep](http://steamrep.com). We do not tolerate any of that behavior.


*Trade formatting rules:*

Any post whose title does not mirror one of the below tags will be automatically deleted by a bot. Please use only one tag per post.

* [H] items [W] items

* [Auction] all auctions must include a reserve price and an end time; anyone who does not honor the reserve at the conclusion of the auction will be permanently banned from this community. All trades with time limits and/or reserves must be posted as auctions.

* [PC] price check

* [Q] question

* [PSA] important or relevant information for the community (note: must have a proper and reliable source)

* [Store] selling 5 or more items at a time

* [Raffle] free-to-enter raffles only

* [Free] giveaway

* [Scammer] this tag may only be used to report scammers found on r/dota2trade (i.e. reddit and Steam accounts are known). Please include the level of detail you would normally use when reporting at SteamRep ([instructions here](http://forums.steamrep.com/threads/howto-report-a-scammer-look-at-acceptable-format-before-posting.51/)).

* [Idea] please message the mods for approval before posting an Idea thread.

Surely a flurry of people will call me delusional but I do not mind. The price is firm and the transaction would be conducted using a reputable middle man if it ever reaches that point.

If any clarification is needed I'll try to post an answer to the questions here.

I haven't been deleting trading card threads on this subreddit; instead I have been leaving a note informing the person posting of r/steamtradingcards. The reason for this is to raise awareness of its existence

A few people have asked if trading cards for items (or vice versa) will be allowed here, but be aware that that may change.

I'm reposting this so new people can see it and existing people who help can find the post that isn't so old. Updated the list with lots of couriers from the first post though as you can till lots of couriers are still missing from the archive. Persian color may or may not exist. I might have missed some people as it is difficult to keep track of tons of people wanting me to add them. Add me instead @ http://steamcommunity.com/id/jerye

I know there has been videos of couriers on youtube already. I'm looking to make individual videos of all the couriers currently out there as well as for future ones in 1080p quality. Basically an archive of all the couriers and effects so you can use them if you want to sell your courier. You can see the current ones here: www.youtube.com/luckynumbersven . The list is as follows:

Do not click any link because how legit it looks

1. Is the user account posting the trade NEW to the site? If yes, all the scammers are using new accounts. So if he suddenly want's to buy a few international couriers for paypal/keys or what not then there's something fishy here. You can easy spot this through the ""join date, or account creation date"" in many forums profiles. 

2. This will be the easiest one, but is it really legit? There are ways to hide a url behind a text, this ""text"" can be displayed as a regular/legit url. This process is called, hyperlinking. 

So really

Here is how: Before clicking a link, and this is an image of how it looks like: 

Tinypic: http://oi50.tinypic.com/70u9mo.jpg

Imageshack: http://img854.imageshack.us/img854/7016/phishingsites.png

Check the obvious title
Check the creation date of the account posting, meaning it's new. This take's away the interest of finding a trustable trade with someone with a new account.
Pass your mouse over the profile link before clicking it

Hope you guys have a nice read

tl;dr Hyperlinks fools your eyes.

1341557940.0,w4ayh,"[PSA] Regarding spreadsheets, price guides, and sharks",musical_hog,29,272

I started this subreddit as an existing moderator of /r/tf2trade to give the burgeoning Dota 2 trading community a safe and healthy place to conduct trades. I planned on running this subreddit in much the same way that I do with my fellow moderators at /tf2trade. The number one thing that I have set out to do is keep this community as safe and enjoyable as possible

The reason the thread was taken down was not because it was not informative,"" and had become a witch hunt. The unfortunate reality is that ""groupthink"" tends to be a popular method of thought on Reddit, even in such a niche community as ours. I do not support such witch hunts, and so I pulled the thread.

After speaking with the OP

*****

Let me just start by saying that it is in the [rules and guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/tcphp/official_rdota2trade_rules_and_guidelines/) that users should not use tools such as spreadsheets, which brings me to my next point.

Sharking has been a major issue in the Steam tradables community as a whole. Sharking is taking advantage of another user's lack of market savvy to trick them into trading their valuable item for your much, so it was not uncommon for extremely unsavory types to shark these items for next to nothing, convincing the victim that they were getting a good deal. The sharks would then re-sell for tons of profit. However, in the last six months or so, there was a major crackdown on this behavior, and many previously ""respected"" traders were outed for sharks, effectively ruining their reputation. Let it be known that I was a major contributor to the fight against sharks

The thing about sharking is that it is not technically a scamming, it will get you immediately removed from the community with close to **zero chance of an unban**. We feel that this type of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, and we do not want it ruining our community. Action has already been taken against users who have attempted this on the subreddit, so please report any instances to the mods and we will examine the case closely.

Now, action may be taken against those users. However, for the time being, we will continue to monitor the situation carefully.

I will allow the discussion of the issue in this PSA

All you have to do is post in this thread or contact me to help us to take the ingame video footage:

- Me (http://steamcommunity.com/id/jerye/)

The process is simple:

1. You add me on steam and let me know which ones on this list you have.
2. I start a custom lobby for the both of us.
3. Once the game starts
4. You can then leave the game with my gratitude. :)
5. Don't be offended if I remove you from the friends list as I have wayyyyy too many people to record from that would fit on it.

Heres the rather large list of what i still need:

*Few notes about HUDs:*

- These HUDs can be shared with anyone in the game

- Radiant Ore and Direstone are available via Chest Series #23-25

- Powered Star

- Valor HUD was given out as a bonus for achieving the stretch goal for The International 3. It is currently the only Genuine HUD.

- Sometimes if you have the HUD equipped by default it may bug out and display incorrectly. In order to fix this all you need to do is select the default from the list and then re-select the HUD of your choosing. If this method doesnt work

- There are posts on the Dota 2 Subreddit explaining to users how they can modify their game files in order to have whatever HUD they desire.  You may do so if you feel the need to

I've sent a message to Steam Support but I'm not expecting a reply soon.

Here's a screenshot of my trade history

http://i.imgur.com/JcE1c.jpg

I believe the hijacker's account was http://steamcommunity.com/id/knobelym as shown in the screenshot. However

After looking around I found that one of his friends (http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198018474142) has an Unusual Seraphic Greevil very similar to the one a had lost (same Effect/Rank/Skills) but can not confirm that it is mine as I don't know how to view that single item's past owners.

Any help would be greatly appreciated 

**EDIT**: I'm not on a LAN and use my own private internet connection. The reason I was hacked was because I was dumb enough to make my password for my steam and E-Mail incredibly similar only with the alteration of a number. I have now changed this problem but it's already too late.

* We are working with /u/rolmos, but I guarantee it will look slick as hell.

*****

* The general consensus regarding PSAs about new scammers was that we should add a [SCAMMER] post tag to the rules. I am fine with this, but with the implementation of this new [SCAMMER] tag, here are the new rules:

1. You may **only** create a [SCAMMER] thread if you can tie the scammer's Steam account to a Reddit account. This means screenshots and such. Use the same level of detail you would when filing a report on [SteamRep](http://steamrep.com). Users you encounter ""in the wild"" are not a top concern for this community.

2. [SCAMMER] threads will be taken down after 12 hours

3. If there are more than two [SCAMMER] threads on the front page at any given time

*****

* I have to remove probably 25-40 threads per day (seriously, instead of taking this course of action, I have decided to bring on **two more moderators** to help handle the mod queue. I am currently looking for one moderator to help with the US overnight queue (UTC +8 - +12) and another US (Pacific) mod. You may submit your application below, but here are the rules for applying:

1. You must have a reddit account older than 6 months. Additional moderator experience a plus

2. You must be **clean** on Steamrep. Absolutely no exceptions. This also means you must have an active and permanent flair.

3. Your comment history must reflect a mature attitude. No trolling

4. You must specify for which position you are applying. Either UTC +8-12 or UTC -8. This means either AUS/NZ and a Pacific coast US redditor.

5. You must explain why you would be a good moderator. English skills are a must.

Provided I see applications I like

1369417480.0,1ezedc,[H] 9 NEW SETS @ the lowest price around [W] Keys,IceQQueen,25,3,61,"**EDIT :**


**This post wasn't started for the sets that came with the last update (CK set

BUT... I will buy any set you want from those released 1-2 hours ago from steam store.

Unfortunately I cant give very good prices on them as they 'll cost me steam funds to get them and prices are kinda fixed :/ You can probably buy them @ those prices from other traders as well.


So here we go :

* ~~Lycan 9 Keys~~   Steam funds not enough to buy another

* ~~CK 8 Keys~~      Steam funds not enough to buy another

* Bone 6 Keys  

* Weaver 5 Keys  

* Mortred 6 Keys  

* Razor 6 Keys  

* Rubick 6 Keys

* Beastmaster 4 Keys

I will add a rare for every set you purchase from me. 3 rares for buying 2 sets. 

I will give you 1 key discount for buying 3 sets.

My rares aren't trash rares

______________________________________________________________________________________________


**SOLD SETS** :

* ~~LYCAN

* ~~WINDRUNNER

* ~~MIRANA

* ~~WARLOCK Archivist Set = 4 KEYS and 3 RANDOM RARES~~

* ~~LONE DRUID Haruspex Set = 4 KEYS AND 3 RANDOM RARES~~


* ~~NYX Hidden Hive = 2 KEYS and 3 RANDOM RARES~~


* ~~LICH Dead Winter = 3 KEYS~~


* ~~RUBICK Zeal Set = 3 KEYS AND 2 RANDOM RARES **Restocked


* ~~KOTL Empowered Vestments Set = 3 KEYS~~


Also selling :

* ~~Stache - 10 Keys 3 random rares (NO TAG)~~

* ~~Bastion Announcer - NO MEGA KILLS - 2 Keys~~

* Starladder ticket : 4 Keys

* G-1 League Ticket : 4 Keys

* American League Ticket : 3 Keys. I will add 1 rare

______________________________________________________________________________________________

If you dont want to trade random rares or you only have good rares

I am trading ~50 good / new / tagged rares for random rares

1363982232.0,1athe1,[Idea] Playing Dota for fun and profit!,iNuzzle,33,11,48,"Greetings Traders! I've run this idea by the mods and gotten a thumbs up

What follows (aside from a wall of text) is mostly cut and pasted from my messages with ham

I'm definitely a small time trader, thanks to my time working in television and my current job teaching English to well over 500 different students here in lovely Barcelona.

I think that I could put my (admittedly limited) time to good use developing the playing of Dota 2 among traders. My specific ideas are as follows and I'd love to hear your feedback about the feasibility of each:

1) A spin on the '1v1 Mid for rares.' This is the simplest plan to put into motion, that seems like an added layer of complexity. Instead I'll just use some items I have (The First Bloods mod I just won seems perfect for a 1v1 award no?) or if it is popular use items that are donated by people who support the idea. I also have a small bit of experience utilizing Twitch as I made some Dota videos to teach my university friends my thought process while I am playing Dota, so casting some playoff games if the community is interested is very possible.

2) Essentially same idea as above, playoffs) to major, where teams bet items against the other; winner take all. If the games are popular, maybe even have Dota2Trade spectators join the betting fun!

3) The first two ideas I could certainly arrange if public opinion deems them worthy. This last one I can't guarantee will happen, but nonetheless official Dota 2 tournaments. The major benefit of this being tournament items dropping with your own name on them, and I think that many a collector who uses this subreddit would jump at that chance to have such items on the market. This is the most nebulous of my ideas, but I wanted to submit it to you regardless.

The first of many things needed: participation. Would you like to see any of these thoughts come to fruition? If so, but I'd prefer you leave your 2 cents in the comments so we can discuss as a community. 

Thank you for your time

Nate

**Miscellaneous information for the buyers / redditors / collectors**
Collecting these couriers now are EXTREMELY hard as many have already disappeared from the market. This is a complete set of all the old couriers.
      
Breakdown of the **fair market value** for the couriers:
     
Frog : ~370k
     
Dog ~ 290k
      
Yak ~ 160k
       
Stumpy ~140k
      
Badger ~110k
        
Morok ~70k
       
Boar ~80k
       
Demon ~110k
      
All in all, searching, negotiating and tracking people down. I do not mind that the offers are currently low, but the value of these couriers have only been going up at a fast pace. It will not take long for them to reach 1,400 keys if they have not already.

Meaning a Divine Essence Stumpy is listed at the Sunfire section where it does not belong:

http://gyazo.com/1b1c43b63b7f7191a645f11f910103d1

http://gyazo.com/b0b3db62c5c52250a8f3db81899b0c0b

These are all Ethereal Flame courier except the first one because of edited description. (If it wasn't for the color I would have fallen for it.)

1363878914.0,1aqhme,[PSA] Valve has lifted 200-sale limit on Steam Community Market (the catch inside),lak3108,23,2,45,"The catch: US residents and citizens must provide information to Valve for compliance with IRS tax code in order to exceed the 200-sale limit. HOWEVER
From the FAQ:
&gt; **Is there a limit on the number of transactions I can participate in in the Community Market?**
Currently there is no limit on the number of transactions you can participate in. However, requires us to collect certain information from you if you engage in more than 200 separate sales transactions in a calendar year. In particular, **if you are a U.S. citizen or resident**, you will need to provide us with your name, address and Social Security Number, and **if you are not a U.S. citizen or resident**, you will need to provide evidence of your non-U.S. status on an online form we provide to you. We will be providing a link to these forms and a process by which you can provide the needed information if and as you approach the 200 sales limit. We may use a third-party to collect this information. You can choose not to provide this information if you wish, and any items listed will be removed. Note that, all of your accounts will be treated as a single account.

And:

&gt; **Will you be providing 1099’s based on my transactions in the Community Market?**
The United States Internal Revenue Service requires us to report gross sales for,000 in gross sales proceeds from those sales transactions in that same calendar year, from all of that subscriber's accounts. If you are a U.S. citizen or resident and exceed both of these thresholds, we will report the amount of gross sales to the IRS and provide you with Form 1099.

This feature is... *drumroll* a [steam nickname](http://i.imgur.com/0bWGSVk.jpg)! YES! YOU'VE GOT IT RIGHT. THE **STEAM NICKNAME**!  
The fastest
   
&gt;**Some tips and tricks**:  
**1**.Add every SR middleman from [here](http://steamrep.com/list/M) and give them ""the real one"" tag. You can cancel the friend request after doing so
**2**.Your tags will appear in the profile and the chat.  
**3**.Normally the impersonator changes his steam name when you're offline or trading via real money. Be sure to check your friendlist from time to time for the ""unknown"" tag and see if there will be some ""wuvs"" or ""Luckybunny"".  
**4**.Once the scammer is recognized you can block him. You can find every blocked user via profile/friendlist/[blocked users](http://i.imgur.com/GkAXKFz.jpg) if desired.  
**5**.Check the nickname history of every person who add you. Most of the retarded scammers have multiple Jerry + Leon + wuvs etc nicknames there.  
**6**. [AONomad](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997100108) says its a good idea to use the Tag option (not the nickname one) for middlemen in your friendlist. This way you can find them more easily since they appear as the group.

1356380413.0,15dzwu,Reguli,musical_hog,23,3,7,"*Regulile descrise mai jos sunt respectate in acest subreddit si de asemenea in comunitatea steam de trading RUGC Dota2.Regulile se pot schimba

*****

**Regulile de postare/schimb**

1. **Regula de baza:** Nu scrie postari sau comentarii care dezavantajeaza alti useri sau creeaza conflict.Comenturile si postarile ofensive,rasiste sau comenturi puse degeaba vor fi sterse iar cel care a postat ar putea fi supus unui ban.

2. **Postarea degeaba**: Deranjand schimburile altora si/sau oferind comentariu asupra pretului fara sa iti fie ceruta asta va rezulta intr-un ban de o saptamana pentru cel ce a postat.Va fi responsabilitatea ta sa trimiti un mesaj moderatorilor dupa o saptamana sa ceri unban.Furtul/deraierea postarilor altora este de asemenea impotriva regulilor si ar putea rezulta intr-un ban.

3. **Vinderea itemelor pe Paypal/Moneypak**: Este admisa.Economia pare si se comporta mult asemenea celei din Team Fortress 2 .Asta inseamna ca 

4. **Iteme din Dota2 pentru jocuri**: Aceasta va fi admisa aici,seriale si chestii de genul.Regula aceasta se aplica de asemenea oricaror bundleuri HumbleBundle pentru ca consideram ca jocurile humblebundle nu trebuie cumparate cu scopul de a face profit.Aceleasi principii se aplica si altor chestii precum cadouri iTunes si asa mai departe.

5. O **singura** postare pe 8 ore. Va rugam nu depasiti aceasta limita.Nu aveti voie sa va stergeti postarile mai vechi pentru a trece peste aceasta regula


6. **Formatarea posturilor**: Va rugam folositi urmatorul tipar pentru a posta schimburi aici (Nota: **folositi litere de tipar!**):

&gt; **[H] Caciulita de Bloodseeker [W] Caciulita de Pudge**

In plus,care nu exista pentru moment in Dota2.

*Update:* Postarile de tip licitatie trebuie sa contina un **pret de rezerva** si un **timp final.** Postarile care nu contin aceste lucruri vor fi sterse.In plus

**Alte taguri pentru postare** 

Poti de asemenea sa postezi folosind urmatoarele taguri:

* [PC] – indica o verificare a pretului

* [Q] – indica o intrebare

* [Store] – indica faptul ca vinzi 5 sau mai multe iteme deodata

* [Raffle] – indica faptul ca creezi o loterie **gratis** (doar acestea vor fi permise)

* [PSA] – indica faptul ca prezinti o informatie importanta sau relevanta pentru comunitate(de exemplu: “[PSA] 
Sepcile de Dota2 pot fi folosite de mai multi eroi”

* [Free] – indica faptul ca daruiesti iteme gratis

* [SCAMMER] – Acest tag poate fi folosit DOAR in cazul reportarii unui scammer gasit aici pe subreddit.Va rugam sa nu postati [SCAMMER] daca nu puteti conecta contul lor steam de contul lor de reddit.Va rugam sa includeti detaliile adecvate pentru a posta un scammer pe SteamRep

* [Idea] – acest tag este  DOAR acceptat daca anuntati moderatorii inainte.Va rugam sa trimiteti un mesaj moderatorilor inainte sa postati.

* [Auction] – acest tag este folosit doar cand prezentati o licitatie pentru itemul care il vindeti.Trebuie sa includeti un  pret de rezerva si un  timp limita. Daca cumva nu onorati o oferta mai buna sau egala cu pretul dumneavoastra de rezerva dupa expirarea timpului de rezerva


*****

**Note**

* Susvotati bazandu-va pe preturi si pe o postare corecta a postului

* Nu cersisti susvoturi.Aceste postari vor fi sterse

* Folositi un tag per postare.Nu combinati tagurile

* Evaziunea banarii si folosirea altor conturi pentru evita regula celor 8 ore va rezulta in banuri severe

* Scammeri vor fi reportati la  /r/badkarma precum si SteamRep.Noi nu toleram astfel de comportament

* Schimbul de conturi de orice fel  este strict interzis.Violeaza codul EULA in intregime si este in general foarte ne-sigur

* Preturile itemelor nu sunt niciodata batute in piatra.Lucruri precum liste sau site-uri de verificare a preturilor sunt folositoare pentru a obtine o idee generala asupra valorii unui item

* Daca schimbi un item pentru Paypal/Moneypak este foarte sugerat sa folosesti un admin de pe SteamRep. Un om de mijloc reduce mult riscul de a fi furat,nu faceti schimbul si ignorati-l.",,False,,t5_2t22d,1365372219.0,trusted,moderator

1357587689.0,164w4n,[H] A Statement Regarding Golden Greevils [W] Your Arguments,pyktrauma,25,6,121,"Hey guys.

I would just like to say one thing regarding the Golden Greevil.  Many people are saying that ""it looks like shit"", whereas the timebreaker when for around 15+ keys when it first came out. 

Therefore, the available supply will become smaller and smaller.  People who do like the item will keep it, and hoarders will hoard more and more GGs.  Both the GG and the Vintage Timebreaker were considered initially ""ugly"" by many.  

Perhaps it will take the full release of dota2 and the consequential large increase in playerbase for the GGs to go up.

Finally

My 2 cents

---

Discussion is welcome, and logical. 

---

Argument 1: The courier market is oversaturated so the Golden Greevil won't rise.

My Response: The Max Head in tf2 is a hat (which is the equivalent of a courier

""Why are Max's Heads more expensive than Big Kills?

Max's Head is an all-class hat. Big kill is a re-skin for a spy weapon that not every spy uses. Big difference in demand there.""

Argument 2: timebreaker has an epic and this shit has nothing so gtfo

The raffle has been cancelled as of now. Seems there is a lack of interest in the prize

I am selling Amnesia the Dark Descent

A special thanks for Magari and TheRealTTN for renting my first items!
 
***How it works:*** 

* Choose an announcer or courier to rent 

* Find its collateral value

* Decide which items you will give me as collateral by using TABLE 2 (Point values should match)

* Decide how long you plan on renting the item for

* Pay the fee if you are doing a one week rental

* Post here with what item you are renting

* I will fill out the rental form for you, and post it

* Trade me for your items!

* Return the items and the fee for your collateral

 **IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO GIVE COLLATERAL**

Even if you don't have significant paypal rep

If you are interested
 



**Collateral:**


* Collateral refers to items that you give me to hold until you return my items. The value of the collateral generally exceeds that of the items you are renting. This is to ensure that I can quickly restock my items if you do not return them. 


* If you meet the terms of the agreement, I fully expect and deserve to be reported as a scammer.


I will **never** trade your items


*Fees*


I charge a small fee to rent my items. For each item available for rental I have listed the daily and weekly price. I will accept pretty much any item for a fee

**Weekly rates**


The weekly fee is always cheaper than paying the daily fee. If you wish to take advantage of the weekly fee

**Daily Rates**


 
* If you choose to pay on a daily basis



* Items in **TABLE 2** and **TABLE 3** will be accepted for fees



***Late Fees***


* I charge the daily rate for every day over the expected duration that you keep my items. No extra fee. 

* If you keep my items 5 days after the expected rental

* If you don't pay your fees when I ask 5 days after the expected rental

I don't want to ever do that

please beware of everything that Sparkyz/bambi/messi sells

Since these 2 have offered me their drodos almost concurrently


**EDIT**: History of Drodo updated

let me once again bring up the History of the drodo directly from tf2 Outpost

http://imgur.com/VM0tSLc

Last 5 owners of the drodo are as follows:

RAZRAZ 591465442

MuXaHcKu 579879516

Sparky™ 581664625

RAZRAZ 576489625

apex 553229201

Seeing that the 2 copies of the drodo exist in Sparky and RAZRAZ inventory now

Note that RAZRAZ AKA EKX77 ON REDDIT traded the drodo he had to MuxachKu his brother or whatever THEN traded the drodo back to himself.

In my opinion a poor way to legitimise a drodo he obviously had a hand in duplicating. His story does NOT check out (his story being he got his brother to do the trade. obviously this cannot be true SINCE he obtained the drodo THEN traded it to his brother/alt AND BACK)",,t5_2t22d,1372186675.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/1h1t7v/psa_duplicated_drodo_on_the_loose/

In the end, because of this red text above my name, many people shunned dealing with me despite me meeting their b/o prices and all. Sometimes i would even add people and they just block me, refuse the request, or add me and when they noticed, just said, sorry you're a scammer




I made this psa not to gain sympathy, who could? Not everyone who is trade banned is a bad person, and the trade probation tells you should be cautious. 




On a high note








An example of this would be:

It should not be as detrimental to the value over 5 keys +/-.

then i did some research, u can see 5pages of posts about selling these couriers on d2l and lots of lots of posts in reddit.. its only 1-2 days of unboxing and we got that much couriers on market.. imagine how many couriers would be at the end of the expirary date (Aug 12).. don't forget tournament courier drops also..  
my point is TI3 couriers are not gonna be as expensive as TI2 couriers.. may be TI3 couriers might fall as low as half the price of TI2 couriers.. so be careful when u think of investing one..

1374727187.0,1j0b25,[Q] Is EF really rare as everyone says?,Delth,28,10,37,"This question has been bugging me for a while and since there's no way to tell how many unusual couriers with certain effects exist

There have been many chests with the usual old effects, Drake, Llama, Kupu, Nimble and Tegu got the old effects applied on them. Recently I've been making claims about the rarity of specific-effects on couriers that came out of the Wax crate. 

Roshan, around 150-200 are unboxed per event but we have a growing community which leads me to assume around 240 were unboxed from the Wax chest. 

And I just divided that number into the 11 different effects so I say less than 30 Sunfire Roshans exist, Vermin, or any old effect from it exist.

Most people who read this just dish this claim away without thinking about it and say EF is the rarest just because.

Well

* Morok: It has been around since the beginning

* Baby Roshan: It never was in any hero chest and didn't get the ""old effects"" until the Wax one

* Llama: Same as Roshan except it wasn't in Diretide or Frostivus. Only 8 pages of trades exist for this one unlike the others. 

And this is what I counted; note I avoided counting the same couriers more than once


Effect | Morok | Roshan | Llama
:----|:-----:|:------:|:------:
AoV | 11 | 0 | 2
LG | 6 | 0 | 1
PB | 6 | 0 | 2
RE | 11 | 4 | 1
SE | 8 | 1 | 1
BA | 15 | 1 | 2
FB | 7 | 3 | 3
EF | 10 | 1 | 1
SF | 6 | 3 | 6
DT | 6 | 20 | 8
FF | 8 | 14 | 3

CE | 3 | 2 | 0
DE | 6 | 16 | 0
TOA | 3 | 10 | 17
LAVA | 11 | 24 | 33


So uh, 1 BA, 1 SE, 3 FB, 3 SF, 4 RE. Also only around three of the total of DT and FF ones had color codes, the rest were tagged.

Now you could say ""but the EF owners don't bother trading them in lounge, there's more EF than PB or LG ones.

To me it seems they have the exact same drop rates on every single effect, BA Roshans with all colors. 

So yeah.. just doing this since people seem to think EF is expensive because it's rare

The Leshrac Thorns Of Sundering Set doesnt show up in the Bundles tab but does show in the Equipment tag

I dont see Shagbark anywhere

Lycan Items seem to be crashing the game

Ive listed Maximilian the Beetlebear as a Genuine courier because it has a 'Games Viewed' tag and is coded the same way as Wynchell Grillhound and Inky (Im assuming its going to be changed to Genuine soon

Basically, which is apparently very valuable. Unfortunately, I wasn't aware of this (I've never really traded with anyone other than real-life friends), and Dota 2 Prices told me that the courier was worth 6 or so keys, which I'm guessing is the price for non-Legacy War Dogs.


I traded the courier for a black Divine Essence War Dog, which led me to believe that the courier's value was equal to only two of those. I thought I was getting a pretty good deal, but I was obviously wrong.
A Redditor alerted me to the fact that my courier was being sold on this subreddit for approximately $500 on [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/1cy0yo/h_jazzberry_jam_pb_wardog_w_offers/)


So, and I'd like to know if there's anything in the trading community (maybe involving reputation?) that would allow me to try to get my War Dog back. Obviously, this is a long shot, and it's my fault for not knowing the value of the item, but clearly the trader knew the courier's true value and was trying to rip me off.


Thanks for your help!

I gave Leon my BattleFury
He kept saying he was waiting for Leon to give the signal. Then he wanted to do more trading

Then this guy I was trading with panicked and said thats not the real Leon. And I knew I was fucked. Basically he said it was my fault logged off and I didn't get my money. Then I checked fake Leon's profile and it was Hidden Strings. I really got robbed and scammed. 

What do i do?

I have all conversations and even a video of the trade going through and all their steam profiles.

##FAQ

**Q:)** I’m actually looking to get keys rather than give keys are you interested in trading?

**A:)** Yes I do have a list down below that lists the items I will trade keys or store credit for and the price I will give.  I will also buy multiple items as well at that price.




**Q:)** Why do prices change so much?

**A:)** It’s just the way of the economy some items become more rare in time where others become less rare and lose value.  Also keys change in price based on the amount of them in circulation sadly those scammers out there drive down the worth of items.




**Q:)** How many modifiers can you have on a strange item?

**A:)** You can add 3 modifiers allowing you to have a total of 4 per piece

 ----
 

##Disclaimer

All prices in this store is my opinion of the item based on economy and ways I feel the items will turn at the time of the update.  The prices here no way suggest this is what an item is worth. I don’t value keys at the standard store price of $2.50 and the price varies day to day.  You can find what I value the keys at in the payment section and its what I use to price the various items. Also any suggestions or constructive cretinism is welcome.


-Prices of the store change from day to day or hour to hour depends on how the economy changes please check back at the store for up to date prices.



-The format of this store was inspired by Div you can find his store [here!](http://redd.it/101fv2)

On top of that they special compared to non-strange items where they keep track of various info that happens in a game with that item equipped. Most of the items tracks how many kills you earn or how many victories. The higher you can get the track # to be the items name upgrades. You can also add additional track information to your strange items by using modifiers.

##Payment Methods:

I mainly trade for keys however to satisfy everyone I use multiple ways to trade with everyone.  If you don’t have Keys for trade then I do accept steam Paypal. However you send first and If I feel any suspicious activity from you I will require a middleman

**Conversions:**

**PayPal** ($1.70) 1 key

 

If you don’t have keys and don’t want to use money I do trade for items for either keys or store credit whichever you prefer is fine.

 ----

##Need Keys? or Want Store Credit?

These are a list of items I'm currently looking for and will trade for multiples of each till I remove them from the list.

1362154247.0,19gut0,[PSA] Update About Phishing Sites &amp; Compromised Steam accounts (MUST READ!),divine_dive,18,0,10,"_Sorry about the caps

***

## Phishing Sites

as many of us know already

__Examples:__

+ http://imgur.com/a/iqLWj
+ http://i.imgur.com/GwaTEjm.png



__How Phishing works__

1. When you enter your id and password on the __phishing site__
2. Steam Guard issues a code and sends to your email and prompts the __bot__ for the code. When the prompt is issued to the __bot__
3. If you enter the code sent to you by Steam Guard on the __phishing site__

***
## Whats New

1. The scammers are now using these compromised accounts and posting the phishing links to their friends. 
2. That is not all

***
## TODO

__How to Prevent__

1. ___Do not enter your Steam credintials on given links___ (even if it was given by your best friend). If you must log in from your browser
2. If your best friend asks you for a expensive item to use
3. Spread the awareness.



__Report the Phishing Site__

+ fill out the from and report it to google: http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish/


__If Account is Compromised__

+ Contact Steam Support Immidiately: https://support.steampowered.com/
 + Explain everything

1361879781.0,1996vk,[PSA] How to solve Replay Download Error,ZantetXuken,19,3,11,"I posted this on r/dota2. I repost this here just in case someone need it and still hasn't read.

For people having trouble with downloading replays (Error 206/0...)

I have a proper solution for this

We have to open Console to show the link (you can jump to 3. if you can show the Console already)

**1 .** Open Steam Library &gt; right click Dota 2 &gt; choose Properties &gt; choose Launch Option &gt; type in ""-console""

**2 .** Launch Dota 2

**3 .** Now go download a replay.

**4 .** Error occurs, open the Console now and you will see something like this in the latest lines:

""http://replay122.valve.net/570/136061218_1841428825.dem.bz2""

**5 .** Copy that link and paste it to web browser such as Chrome/Firefox

Ok we download that replay really fast and smooth

**6 .** Extract that archive bz2 file. Cut off the name of that .dem file from ""_"" to the end.

eg: 136061218_1841428825.dem -&gt; 136061218.dem

**7 .** Put it in ""C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\dota\replays"" (window 7 and xp

**8 .** We are all set

**#Note:** To disable the annoying Console always show whenever you launch Dota 2, so that I write it down here)

**1a .** Create new file named ""autoexec.cfg"" in ""C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\dota\cfg""

or Open it if you created it already.

**2a .** type in ""con_enable 1"". Save and close the file.

Hope all this can help you enjoy your replay!",,t5_2t22d,1361900909.0,,default,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/1996vk/psa_how_to_solve_replay_download_error/

It's very quick and easy to use.

**1. Make sure your inventory is set to public.**

**2. Add dota2bot1 or dota2bot2 to your friends list. Their names will have the format [AutomatedBot]Dota2 Bot #.**

**3. Initiate a trade with the bot. The bot will send you messages on how to use it. Or see below.**

To use the bot:

Add 4 of a item rarity, you get 1 rare, etc.

Add 1 item, you receive 3 uncommons, etc.

Some things to keep in mind:

The bots are very busy. I am working on adding more.

The bots have a timer

The bots have an idle timer

If no one will !tradedown, once they are gone, that's it, until people add more. So help keep these bots going.

**You CAN'T trade essences, or anything that ISN'T equipment.**

The bot has pseudo-random item giving. If you put an item in, and place another item in. The order of items is determined when the bot loads. It will trade items in that order, until the item is off the list, then it will change the item.

If you have any issues

You can now trade multiple items

**So

We now have a Steam Group Page. I will be moving over all discussions to it

http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dota2Bot

**NO MORE DUPES** The bots will no longer add dupe items into the trade. Rest assured you won't get 3 Staff O'Wicked Baddness'.

**Bonus items are here!!** Some of you may have noticed an out of place item on the bots

You may be wondering, all you have to do is !tradedown a rare, or 3. Each rare that you !tradedown will give you a chance to get the item.

One thing, just re-accept the trade. If you do, then the bonus item will be removed. I will not give the bonus item back to you.",,True,,t5_2t22d,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/14p5iz/store_the_first_ever_random_item_bot_improved/

For Science!*

~~THE UPVOTE RUSH~~ **KING OF THE HILL:**

This raffle will work like this:

* Post comments below.

* Upvote interesting comments within this thread

* In 4 hours (3pm PST) I will give a rare Description Tag tool to the person who has received the highest upvote ratio.

Have at it

**EDIT:** Well it's been one hour

**EDIT:** Been 2 hours

**EDIT:** One hour left! Thanks everyone for your comments

**EDIT: THE RAFFLE IS OVER!**

Congratulations to the winner

**A FEW NOTES:**

* For the sake of science (need better control group) I will not be allowing the use of formatting in future auctions.  While I'm sure 470's comment would have won regardless

* I will be looking forward to participating in 470's raffle; if I win that one there is a possibility this subreddit could implode on itself

* The winning tactic seems a little too close to breaking raffle rules.  You are not allowed to create a raffle in which participants give up items for the chance to win something.  While items didn't explicitly determine the outcome of this raffle, I'm pretty sure this tactic will always win, so in future raffles this will not be allowed, once again for science.

* If this tactic were allowed with the note that all future raffles also had to be King of the Hill (as opposed to -470-'s random raffle

* *To everyone who cries down their face about the ""exploiters"" who won unusual golden roshes, for science), and while the golden rosh tactics are cheesy too, PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE SHAT ON FOR THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX AND EXPLOITING LOOPHOLES.  You commend them and close the loophole, for science.*

~~I've been seeing a lot of these people selling stuff like Drow bow for 17+ keys and the script sword for 35-40 keys, now is your chance. Also, the mouse says it is limited edition, which makes me think that there is a limited amount of kantusa swords that will ever be created (just my speculation though).~~

~~If you want the item and the merchandise and you're buying from me

~~**FAQ**~~

~~**WHY are you even offering this? I'm afraid to be scammed.** ~~

~~Some people don't have access to Paypal, so while I'm not willing to sell my own copies, this is your chance to get these items for set-in-stone prices without paying for shipping (or at least Valve's shipping). Like I said, I was ordering from the shop for myself, so I'm throwing this out there for anyone who wants to join in and order these items for a set price since there aren't really on the market at the moment.~~

~~**When will you be ordering?**~~

~~**Can I give you items for this stuff?**~~

~~**Can I get a discount if I order multiple things?**~~

1366462654.0,1cqlqh,[H] qdt`s Epic Tournament Juggernaut Sets and Pieces [W] Keys / Paypal,qdt,19,3,1,"Hello great trading community buyers sellers and collectors.

Here you have the chance to grab one of the best and famous tournament sets out there in dota2 so far.

I am looking to cashout all my inventory and thats why i place it here.

There will be no quicksells but i decided to take / note offers now for all sets individually. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the non set parts you may offer for every single piece.
--------------------------
Nontheless I am still looking for any decent offers for the whole bundle.

I am expecting to note offers only when they are valid at least some days.

If there are any questions concerning particular items etc. feel free to add and ask me.

I am trying to give as much information about these tournament item i can provide.

Just to point it out here at some point my items will not have the best tags but i myself decided to collect most of the items to the value of their first drop.

I will mark those numbers red where the items are at a very very high chance first of a kind drops.

When it comes to the tournament items everyone knows in the end there will be a huge amount of each item and several ones with very good tags.

But keep in mind only one counting as a first drop though. Here you got some of them with the earliest ids you can find.

There is no 100% confirmation about the first of a kind drop but iam long enough and from the beginning in the 

scene to know almost every juggernaut item drop back in 2012.

1349355769.0,10xm1o,[PSA] Alpine Stalker PANICS,irish_00,18,2,42,"I hate provocation and seriously [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/10xbge/psa_looks_like_apline_stalker_set_is_returning/) is making me quite mad. This simply cannot be even an announcement because it is showing the situation in shady details.

I'd like to point out few things from the [dotaholic](http://dotaholic.com/dota-2/patch-notes/patch/177.00) research.

(!) Facts:

* Alpine was not **added** to the latest patch.
* Alpine is mentioned in the **Changes** tab.
* The only mentioned change about the set is that is was renamed from ""The Alpine Stalker **Bundle**"" to ""The Alpine Stalker's **Set**"".
* Among with Alpine **non-sold** ""Wicked Bad Vodooo **Bundle**"" was renamed to ""Wicked Bad Voodoo **Set**"".
* And at the same time Hammer of Hope is now part of the The Hierophant's Protection **Bundle**.


(!) Considerations:

* IMHO if name was changed from the **bundle** to **set** that can definitely mean that is is **not going to be sold**. Bundle - is something u can get discount with
* So inevitable conclusion from here is that set can be added as **drop only** or stay in the **ghost state** as it is now, set don't fit the game and dota is still beta - why can't this set just stay there as some fun development relic? ;P
* And yes, please, think a bit before going crazy.

The implications of this are simple and clear: 

**Conducting cash sales will be much riskier without the use of a middleman.**

I can't guarantee that all SR+ middlemen will be ceasing their services, as well as a number of other community admins, will be bowing out.

I encourage everyone to be as safe as possible when trading, scammers are everywhere, even in our dear subreddit. Take every precaution you can. Here are some tips on how to tell if someone is trustworthy:

1. How old is their Steam account? If it's several years old

2. Do they have many games? If the account has a few F2P games loaded up, it is probably safer than otherwise.

3. Do they have a reputation thread on SourceOP.com? SourceOP is the birthplace of the TF2 trading community. Rep threads are hosted there to keep track of cash transactions. If the other user has more than one or two pages of rep from a variety of users

4. If they are putting a lot of pressure on you to complete the trade and you're unsure
