1372368268.0,1h7esc,The unified Hernandez-Tebow-Ray Lewis theory,Larry_Fishburn,22,3,7,"So my friend sends me an email says: 28 NFL players arrested since the the Super Bowl and 3 of them involve murder/attempted murder. These are the consequences of having Ray Lewis as a mentor to young athletes.

Here is my thoughtful response:

January 6

After a disappointing 5-11 season, he could be a better coach for this team than I can. Ray was incredible! He never took a play off, Ray had the best season of his career and we SHIT ON IT!!"" Billick's head collapsed into his hands, the bartender and the few remaining patrons thought he was about to cry. ""If only I had ten more Ray Lewis' on that defense...We'd be CHAMPIONS!"" He shook his head with an exaggerated ""Ugh"", his old sagging skin flapping about his cheeks. He slammed a wad of cash down on the bar, looked up at the bartender and said, ""Keep the change, this might be last you see of me in this town."" as he staggered out the door. Charlie knew he was right. No way the Modells would bring Billick back after that travesty of a season. He bowed his head too

But at the end of the bar Billick's last exclamation caught the attention of another sorry soul who had come in to drown his own professional failures in booze. Dr. Benajmin Lloyd

In that tavern parking lot

""Coach Billick, no. you don't understand. Look, my name is Dr. Lloyd. Benjamin Lloyd. I work for the Pentagon...Well, at least I used to..."" The coach looked right through him, barely able to focus his eyes, he shrugged and said ""Yea, so? What can i do for ya Doc? You can have my season tickets, I'm not much of a sports fan."" the Doctor quickly replied

Dr. Lloyd explained that he was part of an elite group of pentagon scientists engaged in a top-secret research project. The project sought to create an army of genetic clones of elite Navy SEAL team commanders in order to overpower Somali and Taliban warlords who had thwarted the US military's large-scale efforts over the last decade.

The project was scuttled due to budget overruns and logistical difficulties in obtaining stem-cell material from European sources who had become increasingly inquisitive about the purpose of their provisions.

The project had been completely shuttered earlier that week

""Look

""And what the fuck does this have to do with me?"" the coach slurred.

""Not you exactly

""Ray? What do you want with him?""

""It's simple really

As Coach Billick drove home his head was swimming. Could this be true? How? What would Goddell say? What would Modell say? How would he explain the existence of 11 Ray Lewis's? Or would he even need to? If he could put this squad together before training camp they'd be unstoppable. And the one thing no one questions in the NFL is performance. If they shut out every pre-season game no one would care where they came from...Right?

It was all too good to be true so he got on the phone with a few trusted colleagues. They all agreed that it sounded insane

…

One week later at a warehouse in Bethesda a black SUV pulls into the parking lot. The vehicle stops and the four doors open. Out steps Brian Billik with his team of trusted advisors: Ravens defensive coordinator Rex Ryan; Bill Belichick

They entered the warehouse and the giant steel doors slammed shut behind them. As the lights flickered on they see a group of men in white lab coats standing near an operating table and an enormous metal box behind them. The box was covered in knobs, unconscious, with an array of IV tubes and suction cups attached to his body. Another set of monitors displayed Lewis' vital signs. In front of the table stood Dr. Benjamin Lloyd.

""Gentlemen

""This better be good"" Belichick grumbled.

""If our calculations are correct, as he turned toward the operating table and made a few adjustments to the wires and tubes.

""Fluids valves are at full capacity"" remarked one of the other scientists. ""Turbines at full speed"" said another.

""Here we go"" said Dr. Lloyd as he began to roll the gurney toward one end of the box.

A door opened at the end of the box in front of Dr. Lloyd. A plume of white steam emitted from the opening and for a moment the table and the Doctor were rendered invisible.

""What the FUCK is he DOING in there?!"" exclaimed Coach Ryan.

""Patience

Although Lloyd and Ray Lewis were concealed in the steam

""EXECUTE PROCEDURE!""

The other three scientists began furiously scrambling around the box

Then

""NO!!! NOT YET! GODDAMN IT!!"" Dr. Lloyd screamed as he raced around to the other end of the box.

""Holy shit

Dr. Lloyd opened the other end of the box and was once again engulfed in white steam. They all could hear his footsteps against the steel floor of the box. Then a CRASH! And Dr. Lloyd’s screams: ""NO! NO! PLEASE DON'T...""

An animalistic screech is heard

The box is sealed and the three remaining scientists examine the monitors. One mutters to himself: ""Dammit

""SOMEONE TELL US WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE!"" Demands Billick.

A scientist approaches the coaches. ""I’m sorry, and I know, we should have been more up front with you all from the beginning. It’s just...We never thought this would happen again. Our calculations were perfect!""

""Well apparently they weren't

""It’s not Ray

""You call this success? That fucking guys is DEAD!"" said Ryan

The scientist raised his hand to calm them, leader-of-men that the city of Baltimore has come to love.” He paused. “The other...is...EVIL.""

The coaches are stunned

""We'll have to destroy the device. And the clones. They'll never see the light of day."" the scientist said reassuringly

""Wait."" Said Coach Meyer. ""You say, just with some...let's say...'character issues'?""

""Well, yes.""

""Don't destroy them."" Meyer said grimly. ""I think I can still use them.""

Eight Months Later...
