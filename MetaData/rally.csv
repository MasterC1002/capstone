When I get more money

Does this sound like a reasonable plan? I'm trying to drift dirt

I also have a few technical questions: 

-Where would you recommend reinforcing (other than strut braces and a roll cage?) 

-What would you do about beefing up the rear, especially in the front.

-Will slotted rotors be good enough or will I want all new brakes? I like the power of my current e30 brakes

-Is the hydraulic handbrake worth it? E30 handbrakes are worthless for handbrake turns

Thanks!

BIG EDIT: 
I think it's important to state my intention. I've gotten a car 8 months ago. Took it to dirt track. Had a blast, and maybe one day compete in.

Now, is to watch them go at it for a full year. VW vs. Citroen, Loeb vs. Ogier, etc. Tons of talent and a lot of money and development put into them. Everyone else is already and also-ran anyways. Ogier shot his mouth off the one season he was #2 at Citroen in a clash of egos (""Justice in the sport"" and all that); since VW entered this year he's been a wrecking ball. Almost 60 points between him and Mikko in second place after FOUR rallies??? Staying out of trouble and having luck on your side certainly helps, but its a torrid pace this early in the rally season.
