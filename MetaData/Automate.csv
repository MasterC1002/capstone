1367598316.0,1dmk91,I had a mildly humorous sales automation experience today that got me thinking.,Vaginal_Scrapings,24,6,1,"Today I unsubscribed from a service I had investigated for an internship some months ago. I realized they were still charging me a monthly fee despite not using their service at all. A lapse in my memory had it go beyond the trial period.

Two hours after I had unsubscribed I get an email from ""a real person"" that stated something to the tune of ""We noticed you cancelled your account. Since you've been using it quite recently we wanted to know why the cancellation?""

I had to laugh

I think it's important for anyone in business or industry to remember that we should approach automation carefully and not try to trick customers or users into believing a real person is serving them. It doesn't phase me in the least but some people might be upset if they realized a company was fibbing about a real person addressing their needs. No one wants to erode trust in an era where touchy subjects like automation already have the skepticism of some.
