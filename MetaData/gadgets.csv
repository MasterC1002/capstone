There've been a lot of changes to my product/business/website recently, and I'd love your feedback!",793,"[Here's the original thread in /r/gadgets from 10 months ago.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/saqvb/so_ive_invented_and_am_selling_fullsize_5/)

[Here's the crappy website to which it linked.](http://oldv1.rgft.net)

**[Here's the new less-crappy website!](http://www.thenoteboard.com)**

Within a week of that going up Noteboards were featured on TechCrunch, whereas the week before I was happily working a unrelated full-time HR job for a non-profit, expecting to maybe sell a few hundred Noteboards in a year, rather than a thousand in a week.

Last July, and have sold about 14,000 total. I'm still working all by myself from the basement of the house I rent with three other guys, and have learned a **lot** about business, taxes, patents, and all kinds of other crazy crap.

Now Noteboards have square-inch

Over the past few weeks I've completely overhauled the site (again). You can see the previous versions here:

* [Version 1](http://oldv1.rgft.net) -- the original
* [Version 2](http://oldv2.rgft.net) -- not very different
* [Version 3](http://oldv3.rgft.net) -- tried pretending I was some legitimate business
* [Version 4](http://oldv4.rgft.net) -- a more Noteboard-focused version. I really like bright colors.
* [Today!](http://www.thenoteboard.com)

**ALSO**, and hope there'll be more -- suggestions welcome!

I'm posting here again in case anyone has questions about Noteboards, I'd really really really like to see Noteboards going to schools and education programs, but I still can't afford to just give a bunch away.

TL;DR /r/gadgets got me a full-time job

EDIT: Massdrop's doing a deal where they're selling Noteboards for cheap! It used to be the main Tweet on the front page of my site

Story:
Dailysteals.com is one of those deal-of-the-day websites.  I found a link, score! Not so much.

I never received a shipping notice, pinned the blame on UPS (probably accurate).  I live in a city though, we have many local post offices, and, despite inquiries, both DailySteals and UPS were useless in pointing me in the right direction.

On my second attempt, and the subwoofer was already blown.  You gotta be kidding me.

I sent them another email, I'm not paying more to send this back with the hopes that they might follow through and pay me back at some point.

I told them they could do better, with no response yet.  I think it's safe to say I won't be getting one.

So, but would see to it that no one else gets screwed over by this company.

TLDR: Dailysteals.com provides shit product with shit customer service.

***AVOID ""http://www.suntekstore.com/""   as they are a scam operation. ***

I ordered an ipad 1 battery case, the item i didn't order. 

So i asked them about the item i did order

So i wait another 10 days and get another item in the post. Straight away without even opening the product i notice something is wrong, not even close.  But it is not a real item, the case itself has very little weight and appears to be mostly plastic, in fact i was guessing that there was no electronic parts inside but there is *something*. There was a USB plug down the bottom of the case that was seemingly just super glued and Jammed inside, http://i.imgur.com/PAt9x.jpg  i plugged it into a USB socket and starting charging which did prove that it must have had some small battery inside that can hold some power and turn on the LED lights down the bottom. However after being on charge for over 3 hours the ""battery case"" only shows 75% charged and i have found that the whole thing will go flat (according to the LED lights anyway) in less than an hour, it doesn't hold charge and i doubt it would ever provide power to an ipad for more than 5 minutes. 

I have been back and forth with many emails to this ""company"" and they have offered a partial refund of $5 USD - after paying $40 plus another $2 after the first wrong item for the restocking fee i would be losing pretty much all of it as the cost of $5 could be written off in the amount of time i have wasted with this educational venture. I have already opened the paypal dispute but paypal had a terrible track record with scams like this and in the past i have even had them ask for the item to be returned to the seller as per the official refund policy of the ""store""

TLDR: suntekstore.com is a scam and just send fake products to get money. 

***Update***
well it seems the company has found this post and are now trying to bribe me into taking down the post. 

&gt;Thanks a lot for your reply. Yes
If you have done


so they are now saying that i can get a full refund where as previously they were only offering $5 or $8. interesting

Also, and i never received any tracking information before hand.

**UPDATE 2**

WIN! - well it seems something actually went right here as i just got an email from paypal saying that i have received a full refund. 

&gt;We have concluded our investigation into your Buyer Claim

even though i am still out the $2 restocking fee as that wasn't part of the ""initial purchase"",,False,self,t5_2qgzt,1345256749.0,,True

Very quickly, largely with the hinge system.  The hinges themselves began to “creek,” and the cables for the speakers ran through the hinges.  After about a month, the right speaker cable was cut by the malfunctioning hinge and stopped working.  Secondly, a mysterious internal “beep” began randomly sounding off every now and again. I am no computer science major, but I do know more about computers than the average person.  The beep was a system beep.  This beep was coming from the motherboard, HD, or some other internal component (not the speakers). It beeped randomly - sometimes when I was gaming or video editing

I called up customer service.  While this was not a particularly painless process (talked to multiple people), but they wouldn’t touch any hardware issues.  After countless hours on the phone with customer service, they finally agreed to send someone to my house to fix the beep and speakers. I was actually pretty happy that they would send someone to me.

The technician came as scheduled. He fixed the speaker.  When I asked about the beep he basically blew me off and gave me some short answer like, though?...  I wouldn't worry about it.""

Whatever. I was so annoyed with the ordeal that I accepted my repaired speaker and moved on.  The speaker worked, so I listened to his advice: I ignored the beep.  It wasn't unbearable, and so as long as it wasn't a serious problem, I could live with it.

Fast-forward a few weeks.  The beeping still persisted, and it ultimately led me to the left hinge.  Yes, the same hinge the technician worked on to replace the speaker a few weeks previous.  I don't know what exactly he did, but trust me when I say he further screwed up the already malfunctioning hinges.

When he closed the LCD back up after replacing the speaker, which basically forced an opening behind the laptop screen.  This created a whole series of problem with this side of the computer. The top of the computer shifted, and the whole hinge area was completely contorted.  He also neglected to replace a screw is on the bottom of the computer that holds everything together.  As a result of the gap he created, dust made its way UNDER the LCD screen where it can't be cleaned or removed. A month later, the hinge snapped. I’m not going to bore you with the details, but let me just say this: Sony’s warranty centers are based outside of the U.S., they were completely unhelpful when I tried to explain that THEIR TECHNICIAN broke my computer further.  I tried relentlessly for months

But, and within 3 months, it was completely off the shelves and replaced by their FZ series.  The whole thing was swept under the rug.  I am no conspiracy theorist, but it’s obvious that they were aware of this and just tried to temporarily appease all of us poor souls who bought the $2,000 laptop until our warranties ran out.  I can see a board room somewhere with executives deciding that it was cheaper to lose us as customers than to help us, since it was such a short-lived product with barely any purchasers.

This is evidenced by the terrible support I received later. About a year after I bought the laptop, HP, Dell, and EVERYONE released windows 7 drivers for models that were two years older or less.  My laptop was only a year old, but nothing. Amazingly (and disgustingly), sony released windows 7 drivers for laptops OLDER than mine, but not mine. More evidence that they were trying to pretend they never released this lemon of a laptop.   I installed Windows 7 and finagled the HELL out of it to get it up and running, I couldn’t get any of the shortcut buttons to work and my webcam wouldn’t work at all.  On a laptop, and none of them could find a work around. 

I found that sony would offer 15 minutes of free chat support

Me: Are there no windows 7 drivers available?  I downloaded the notebook utilities but it doesnt seem to be compatible. However

Technician: LovableContrarian, but the av MODE BUTTON WILL NOT WORK AS EXPECTED.

Me: Okay

Me: Can you explain what you are going to do

Technician: Sure

Me: Well can you just tell me how to fix it really quick? I feel like nothing was really done in the 15 minute time period.  I have no problem doing the workaround myself…  Is there an online link explaining it?

Technician: LovableContrarian

Me: No thank you

It was a complete bait and switch.  Again, and I was asking for something they should have offered to EVERYONE for FREE.  I was asking for driver support for a year-old laptop, and they want every individual to pay $25 for some guy to give it to you. To this day, there has been no public fix for the webcam or buttons, and they are still non-functioning.

Here I am with a $1, and a hinge I had to replace myself.  There is an insane amount of dust under the screen and it continues to get worse.  And, still, something internal randomly beeps at me.  It feels like I bought a $1,800 problem.  I’ve wasted HUNDREDS of hours talking to customer service, looking through forums for solutions, trying drivers, I’ve been treated as a second-class customer that needs to leave them alone. When they finally sent one person to help

And, even if you have a working Sony laptop, their driver support is awful. Unless you get a hacked driver, you will be using an old nvidia driver because they only update them once a year (if that). Sony is the ONLY producer with this lack of support for video drivers. And, they only put a small portion of their bundled driver/software on their support site, so if you ever reformat, you lose programs and functionality. This is all from Sony, which is probably the most expensive windows PC manufacturer around.

I’m certainly not asking for upvotes here, I thank you for listening, and I advise you to avoid Sony’s Vaio division like the plague.",,False,self,t5_2qgzt,,http://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/o4a7g/why_you_should_avoid_sony_vaio_computers_or_my/

EDIT:
Really appreciate the comments guys. If you're feeling generous give me a like on Facebook. Just set up the FB account and need to raise awareness. 


EDIT2: Guys I have had some really great feed back and really appreciate it. The general consensus is if I want to hit retail stores in the US the price need to come down. Also we need to rename the 'Mates' to 'Buddies' or similar. Yes we are based in Australia like most of you worked out. I was not intending for this to be a sales tool

EDIT3: I have shuffled the order of slides based on the feed back from you guys. I hope this helps engage users more when they hit our landing page.
