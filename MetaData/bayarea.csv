1328222200.0,p8cyg,Stood Naked at California &amp; Montgomery to Protest Hate-Mongering Christians - Director of HR Walked By,himynameisthor,734,223,175,"I was just coming back from lunch in the Financial District when I saw some crazy hate-mongering christians standing at the corner of California &amp; Montgomery screaming at everyone around that they're going to hell.

I attempted to converse with them about their position, so I figured I'd do what any reasonable person would do: get nekkid.

I took off my sweater, letting them fall to the ground. I wasn't wearing underwear. I just stood there in front of the protesters waiting for them to answer my questions.

This went on for about 10 minutes. A couple of people offered encouragement

On the way back to my office, I said I was having a conversation with those christians. She asked ""a naked conversation?"" to which I replied ""well, I was naked, but they weren't.""

She asked me why. I asked her if it was relevant to my job. She asked me if it was relevant to my job. I said it's not relevant to my job. She said okay

Am I going to get fired?

1371231636.0,1gcmso,Regarding the young man who was murdered this week (link is currently top post of this sub),bayareatrojan,267,36,17,"Hello /r/BayArea

As many of you saw

I know this gets thrown around a lot, all tied together through Aya. Aya was one of the funniest guys I know, always with a huge smile on his face and cracking everyone up. Not a single person who knew Aya disliked him, it was impossible to. 

Aya has a beautiful soul, joy, and humor. He was the Bay Area sports fan I know, especially with the Warriors (although he loved the Niners so much). Without a doubt the biggest Warriors fan in the entire Bay Area. No matter what our record was, ""this is our year. Keep the faith"".

His outlook on life was full of optimism and positive energy. He wasn't without struggles in life either

The only thing keeping us going right now is remembering the endless positive times we have shared with Aya and how much joy he brought to everyone who knew him. I'm trying not to think about how we lost him or just how fucked up and shitty this world can be

Sorry for the rant but I think everyone should know how amazing Aya was and how special he was to all who were lucky enough to know him. I for one am truly blessed to of had Aya in my life and to be able to call him one of my best friends.

I think it's great that they've created a sense of community by treating r/chicago as a central hub and jumping off points for all the other discussions and specific interests

1338469329.0,udsiq,Anyone else seeing suddenly abysmal data performance with AT&amp;T iPhones in the Bay?,wowbobwow,157,14,79,"I started noticing this on Saturday or Sunday - my iPhone (a 4G with the ""grandfathered"" Unlimited plan) can only intermittently pull down any data over 3G. I initially suspected it was just my phone acting up (former Apple Genius here)

Anyone else seeing something similar? I don't believe I'm being throttled (no where near the 5GB cap for the month)

**UPDATE:** Spent nearly two hours on chat session w/ AT&amp;T support tech. Explained that I've already reset settings, after ages of restarts and tinkering, the tech asks me to confirm my IMEI - the one he had in his system was completely different than what I actually have. After updating that and a final reboot I now have full speedy 3G access again. If you are seeing similar problems, I *strongly* suggest that you have AT&amp;T confirm your IMEI matches against what your phone actually has!

**UPDATE 2:** Annnnd... it's dead again. FML. Not remotely sure what to do now.

**UPDATE 3:** 2nd chat session with AT&amp;T rep (""Dale"" this time) confirms - AT&amp;T is having major infrastructure issues around the Bay. Their official advice: ""Keep rebooting your phone and call in to check."" He advised me to call the sales number and request a bill adjustment for the days with degraded service. Yay. Sprint or Verizon

**SUGGESTION:** I would strongly encourage you all to call or chat to AT&amp;T Support to confirm that you are also having these issues.

Discovered about 5 blocks from where it was last seen, the first thing we asked if he was just drunk or didn't remember where he parked it. But the answer is no. He doesn't park on the sidewalk and there's always parking for a bike on his street.

So basically

But my buddy says thank you to /bayarea and wanted to spread the good news so he didn't get tackled off his bike if you saw him around. haha

Thanks again!

**July 7th Scavenger Hunt**
We received so much positive feedback from the last scavenger hunt that we just couldn't wait to create another one. So here it is!

Show up on Saturday, work as a team, and google keywords. If you're new to the city or want to make new friends I can guarantee that you will know new people by the end of this event.

You'll spend the evening finding historic locations

You can choose between buying an individual ticket and letting us pair you with a team or

After completing this race

RSVP here: https://www.wepay.com/events/sf-scavenger-hunt-the-mission-and-the-haight (ignore haight in the link

New things:

You have the choice between creating a custom team or being placed on a really fun, if you need 1 or 2 people to fill out a team try posting in IRC, on Facebook or reddit. 

The price has changed- it's $4. Costs were just covered last time (only because of cookies) and a few awesome changes will make this scavenger hunt slightly more expensive to set up.

We'll have live people as clues

If you do not want to participate but want to help out we are looking for volunteers to be live clues or guard clues to ensure they are not damaged or stolen. Email me at amylukima@gmail.com

1371277520.0,1gdztr,Another incident at 16th &amp; Mission BART station! 6/14 (approx 6:40pm),The_Malebranche,97,20,34,"Anyone else witness this?

It was around 6:35pm. I had just left work in Union Square
As the SFO bound train pulled into the 16th &amp; Mission station, I realized why.

On the other side of the station at least a dozen or so SFPD and BART Police officiers appeared to have surrounded an extremely agitated individual. The BART train opposite my own was also on the tracks

As the doors opened, and the last staircase out of the station, a pretty serious standoff was happening. The loud and distinct rack of a pump action shotgun pierced the air as the growing number of officers rushing to the scene all drew their weapons on the perpetrator. Surrounded, and hopelessly outgunned - I heard suspect screaming ""Fuck you!!!"" back at the cops, while things continued to escalate.

The panic in the air was thick as the small crowd of bystanders all ran in opposite directions from the scene. Many fled for cover back into the train cars - those who could darted back towards the other sets of stairs. Many were watching behind cover

As I made my way away from the chaos and towards the opposite end of the station, but the way I saw the police responding, it was safe to assume so at the time. As the police's orders continued to get louder and louder without any gunfire, I assumed it was just another ""naked guy in BART"", or bum situation - so I left rear of the station to get a closer look.

The guy is completely surrounded at this point, and a taser to the face did not sound like the icing I wanted for my Friday night cake.
I was really surprised to hear the shot.

It did not sound like a pistol sized taser (which typically uses charged co2 cartridges), the police dog-piled the suspect and he was (perhaps unconsciously) in custody. 

As I made my way up the stairs and out of the station I noticed two police officiers

Living in SF

Anyone have a video? Also

TL;DR: Got off the BART in the middle of police standoff. People were freaked. Dude fought law and lost hard. Pepper spray sucks.



**UPDATE**
**6/15 (approx 4:45pm) EVENT #2 !!!!!**

Ironically the entire intersection of Sutter and Grant was just evacuated right in front of me due to a bomb scare. Police cars and bomb sniffing dogs were absolutely swarming the scene within minutes! I was at work

Apparently some kids threw a high powered firework (possibly an M-80

According to the SFPD officer I questioned, said a nearby security guard.

I personally saw one suspect being tackled by a group of fed up civilians preforming a citizens arrest (you guys rock) who may

Either way

Also, an ass kicking would have definitely been in store for him. He's lucky he wasn't shot!

I'm sure a full story on this will be available shortly...

Was anyone else there?

He is two years old, amazing dog, but recent changes in my life have made me realize that Banksy needs a new home, more room and more attention than I am now able to give him. I am utterly heartbroken over this and looking for the best home possible so that I know this wonderful dog can be happy from now on.

Banksy (neutered) was adopted at 9 weeks old. By 12 weeks, high-energy dog so they could run it out of each other.

**Crissy Field Monthly Meetup
We are doing a potluck picnic at Crissy Field starting at 11am. This is the same place the first GrMD was held. It has amazing views of the bridge and bay. Make sure to dress in layers as it can get very windy there. Picnic tables and grills tend to be full early in the day so if you get there a little early and see a free table please grab it. I'll bring the reddit banner to help you find us. 


I'm going to make some more alcoholic punches and I'll bring a giant jug of water as well. If you can bring a little bit of cash to help cover ingredients and cups/paper plates/nametags/forks/spoons/napkins that would be awesome.   


If you use this address you should get directions to the picnic area.

**Here's some information I copied from the crissy field site.**

* Park in beachfront lots just west of the Marina gate.
* Bring sweatshirts and sunglasses for the kids
* Although the water is usually clean and safe
* The Warming Hut is
* The wind usually picks up by mid-day. If you want a quiet walk
* The beach can be seen at its widest during low tide.
* You can legally fish or crab without a license at Torpedo Wharf at the west end of Crissy Field. Look for posted regulations.

**What should you bring to a potluck?**

* hotdogs
* hamburgers
* buns
* chips
* desserts
* sides
* drinks
* cash(in case everyone brings chips and we need to do a Safeway run)
* drinks



**Halloween Party
[We are having a big party at Fort Mason center.
](http://www.facebook.com/events/488317277846859/declines/?notif_t=group_activity)
Like we've discussed in previous threads our group has grown a little too big for us to do major indoor parties at public venues. So for Halloween we are going to try to host our first event at a totally private venue-the Fleet Room at Fort Mason center. If you have an idea for an activity, which is a laughable number for us.


Unfortunately private venues cost money. The room fees, I pre-paid the fees before we found a house we liked and decided to make an offer. We'll have to come up a downpayment soon so if you know you are going I would appreciate it so much if you could buy your ticket ASAP.

https://www.wepay.com/events/reddit-trick-or-treat-meetup-day-2012

Here's the generic description for our Halloween Party on reddit:
Join in on our 2nd annual reddit Trick or Treat meetup day!
This year we've reserved the fleet room at Fort Mason Center for a totally private event to avoid the awkward ""Are you from the internet"" moments. There will be a dance area
Prior to this party we'll also be hosting another small groups dinner session. You can sign up and be assigned to a small group of internet strangers to have dinner with at a nearby restaurant. That way you'll be able to get to know someone before you arrive. To sign up send an email to amylukima@gmail.com

We'll take photos of costumes and upload them to reddit gifts for the internet to vote on. The overall top 5 winners will receive gift certificates from reddit gifts.

A few weeks ago a fellow redditor posted on here saying she needed to find a home for her big dog named Banksy. She said he was the perfect dog, it seemed like something I could handle. I told her if no one else could take him

It's been a few weeks and things have been... stressful. Long story short he does not get along with my one year old male dog, I'm now looking for a new home for Mr. Banksy.


I know that isn't the best way to sell someone on this dog

Now, about 90 lbs (although he could afford to lose 10-15 lbs at least), but he doesn't realize his size. He needs to be trained to be around other dogs and learn what is appropriate as far as level of aggression while playing. He's also not leashed trained very well, but in the few weeks we've had him, he has gotten better. When you're on the couch he LOVES to cuddle up next to you and really likes attention. He loves playing tug and also likes playing fetch with a semi-deflated soccer ball. He needs someone who is experienced in training big dogs. Also it would probably be best if he was the only dog in the house, at least until he's better socialized.

We had so much fun at the meetup last month that we are doing another one! The biggest complaint in the last thread was that we gave to late of notice (like omg 1 day wasn’t enough!?) Any way we are planning another meetup 2 weeks from now. Info below”

**WHEN:** Sunday

**WHERE:** [Chabot Gun Club in Castro Valley](https://plus.google.com/112901592242016466001/about?gl=us&amp;hl=en)

So if you are a bay area gun owner and feel like putting some rounds down range with some fellow redditors please join us for a morning/afternoon of pleasant conversation and hot lead

If you are not a gun owner but are interested in guns and would like to learn about shooting and firearms in a stress free and safe environment we would love for you to join us. At the last meetup we had all sorts of guns big and small, modern rifles, and vintage rifles, so you can learn as much as you want!

If you despise guns and think they are the spawn of Satan you are welcome to come too!  Everyone should know about firearm safety and how to operate a firearm correctly even if you are morally opposed to their existence. Even if we can’t convince you that guns are great I promise we will respect you and your opinion :)

**EDIT:** Please fill out this doodle (survey majigger) to let us know what day works best for every one! http://doodle.com/adx6cyns8perdqt7

I'm currently living in San Diego, but I'm 420 friendly if you indulge.  I'm sorry if this is coming off as a craigslist spam, but I'm desperate and figured the hivemind may offer a hand.  

A little bit more about me: I'm as likely to freak out over some new app/software/tech as a I am about so and so band coming to SF.  Which basically means I try to fill up my life with concerts, home brewing (I'm from San Diego, I'll bring you cases of beer).  I'm a really optimistic guy and 2013 for me personally has exponentially been better with each passing day.  At this pace I should be the President by New Years.

We need not to do this. We have a beautiful opportunity here - to embrace each other and our larger community and the thrills and joys that can come from all areas in the Bay.

Discussions about whether or not Danville is 'legit' Bay Area. Dismissing San Jose news and opinion because it 'sucks'. Hating on Oakland because of it's reputation as dangerous. This all serves no one

There has been a sudden surge in the popularity of individual city subs in the BA and it is because of such malicious remarks.

I don't see the purpose of having to break our potential community apart due to such absurdity.

I looked at the oakland sub today and they have a post about the art murmur, or Palo Alto?

I don't know beyond making a post like this how I could better encourage positive use of the Bay Area reddit. If anyone has any suggestions I am open to them. Perhaps

So let's start an open a dialog about this.

Keeping Marin preserved in its natural state vs. a train/affordable housing that would bring more human traffic/ larger pop. is a very complex issue for me and everyone I've talked to here about it. I want nothing more than for everyone to be able to experience living here, not that any group is unwelcome or wouldn't care about preserving nature, because that's clearly racist classist bullshit. 
I'd love to have a conversation about this, as I thought it did in the George Lucas posts. Speaking as a low-income person, we have no inherent desire to treat our surrounding badly. It's also really important remember that some areas of Marin are zoned for only 1 house per .5 acre. This was to protect nature, but unfortunately it's part of the reason why most of the time only the wealthy are able to live here.",,False,self,1353906489.0,t3_13q9r9

As mentioned on a previous bill

For the current billing cycle

Smartphone customers with unlimited data plans may experience reduced speeds once their usage in a billing cycle reaches the level that puts them among the top 5 percent of heaviest data users. These customers can still use unlimited data and their speeds will be restored with the start of the next billing cycle. 

We're writing because you are in the top 5 percent of heaviest data users for this billing cycle. Because we recognize that data usage can change from month to month

Beginning with your next billing cycle

Customers have several ways to manage extremely high data usage. 

Wi-Fi offers great speeds and doesn't add to your wireless data usage. Consider using Wi-Fi when possible for applications that use the highest amounts of data, large data-file transfers (like video) and some online gaming. 

You may also consider switching to a tiered data plan if speed is more important to you than having an unlimited data plan. Customers on tiered plans can pay for more data if they need it

**The plan:**

* Sign up on [CampingBud](http://campingbud.com/t/CQTID)  - this is what we're using to organize the trip

* Leave the Bay Area for the Pinnacles morning of 3/30. Return afternoon/evening of 3/31. Rideshares to be posted to our campingbud website (more on that in a minute).

We are allowed to start setting up camp at 1pm. If you want to get there earlier to hike or climb whatever, or maybe cards against humanity, or who knows, we always find ways to amuse ourselves. In the morning we have to clean up and clear out the campsite by 11am. You are welcomed to stay longer to hike and or climb more if you move your car to the main lot.

A fellow SF Redditor

**How to sign up**

1.	Go to [CampingBud](http://campingbud.com/t/CQTID)

2.	Click Join This Trip (up on the top right)

3.	Register with your name

**Using the site**

4.	Sign up for Carpooling (Transportation link at top)– We have very limited parking so carpooling is a must. If you have a car

* how many free spots you have
* what city you will be leaving from
* what times you plan on leaving/coming back.
 
It’s ok if this is your first trip and are apprehensive of riding with someone you don’t know. We were all n00bs once too

5.	Sign up for tent space (Lodging link at top) – sign up for where you’re sleeping. We have a couple to borrow

6.	Sign up to bring stuff (Items link at top) - We always need some camp necessities, and beer. Let us know what you are bringing to share so we don't all show up with 50 packs of hotdogs.

7.	Pay your share of the reservation fee ($8.50) online or

**Be responsible for your own stuff – You’re going to want a **

* sleeping bag
* pad or air-mattress to sleep on
* pillow

**Rules:**

Please keep your camping / ride status updated. If you can no longer make it

Please see park rules for other info: http://www.nps.gov/pinn/planyourvisit/cgrules.htm

We have two group campsites put together



**Activities**

With a large amount of people, go climb. Want to go check out the caves (of course you do), lets go. If you want to sit and camp and drink, that’s a-ok too. Just remember, Pinnacle climbing is srs bzns for experienced climbers only. I don’t know a damn thing about climbing, so I can’t answer any of your climbing questions. 



**FAQ’s**

**Can I come if I don’t have any supplies?**

You do need to be responsible for yourself. You can always rent tents



**Are there restrooms?**

Yes. With running water. There’s even a couple showers.



**Will there be campfires?**

Yes



**Can I bring my child?** 

No. We’re a bunch of 20 and 30 somethings enjoying nature and drinking in the woods. We can be somewhat vulgar at times



**Can I bring my dog?** 

Yes. But keep him/her off of the trails. Park rules. Also



**OMG are there really caves?**

Yes



**What’s the reservation fee?**

The reservation fee is the fee I paid for us to rent the campsites for the night. It should come out to around $8 a person.



**What is the entrance fee?**

The park charges a $5 entrance fee per vehicle that is not included in the reservation fee. Please pay the nice ranger at the entrance 5 per car for the whole weekend. 



**Can I get on the Waitlist?**

Yes. The site should email you once someone cancels and there is room for you



**Blah Blah Blah Blah?**

I’ve never been to the Pinnacles before so I can’t answer a lot of questions. Please refer to the nps website for any questions
