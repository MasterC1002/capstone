1317845646.0,l236d,A few things I've learned about WWE over the 20+ years that I've watched professional wrestling.....,0wlbear,46,12,52,"I thought I'd share some truths with everyone today.  A few things that popped into my head on the way to work this morning.  Certain things that will and will always be in the world of WWE.

* **The WWE does not give one shit about the IWC ""Smarks""**
   This is a fact.  The WWE's one and only concern is profit and that's it.  I like Daniel Bryan as much as the next guy but if Cena's making the most money, whoever's bringing the green is all they care about.

* **Great wrestlers do not win championships.  Great personalities do.**
This is the reason John Morrison and Kofi Kingston will never be main eventers.  Both are extremely talented in the ring and are fun to watch but they are god awful on a microphone.  They do enough to have people like them and sell t-shirts but WWE will not put their weight behind them if they can't carry a promo.

*  **No matter how bad RAW gets or how dull it may be compared to the ""good old days"" we will always tune in**
Think of the WWE as your favorite sports team.  When it's good

*  **A wrestling match is more entertaining by how many kick outs of pinfalls there are**
If I had the time I'd like to do a study and prove that Wrestlemania main events in the past 10 years average 25 kickouts of pinfalls a match.  Well performed spots make it entertaining but kicking out of finishing moves makes the match epic.

AND I expect downvotes here

* **The Attitude Era is overrated**
Hear me out.  The Attitude Era was fun and had some memorable moments.  The era of Steve Austin, Austin vs The Rock, Austin vs Mankind; rinse and repeat.  Shit, eventually they had to turn Austin heel because people were getting tired of him as well.  

All in all I do still enjoy wrestling/WWE and thought I'd share a few things.

r/prowrestling is not the moderator's blog.

It is not just his contributions here.  The works here are the works of the community.

He is not the publisher of the content nor the provider of the discussion forums.

He is just the host.  His job is moderator.  His job is to keep us from having to see bots posting advertisements for penis pills and frankly that's all I *want* him to do in his role as moderator.

And many of us are weary about the sole moderator's control over the content, sensibilities, and vendettas.

So, a guest list, and activities.  

Our host kinda sucks.  And he sucks as a host like having a militant vegetarian as the host of a BBQ - we all love food but he should quit telling us as *the* authority figure what we *should* like to eat, and certainly shouldn't fucking throw our contributions in the trash if *he* finds it not to be to *his* liking (fucking *""spam!""*).  But when anyone dares to question his tastes, no matter how impersonally (*""now with all that we know about food safety, one would have to be crazy to do that in cooking!""*), he is met with a never-let-them-get-the-last-word argument that is usually unsupported by the rest of the party as a ridiculous argument over the merits of *an opinion* until he ultimately throws the guest out in frustration.  Most of us like *meat.*  A lot of us think we should eat more greens and we all share recipes when some veggie dish is interesting.  Some like foreign.  Some like domestic or even local.  And a lot of people like chain restaurants.  Big deal.  Don't like it - don't eat it.

So this is what we do here: we love discussing restaurants, some of us love watching behinds the scenes as it cooks, we shoot the fucking breeze, and we sure as hell love to *eat.*  But *we* bring the food to the potluck.  Not just the moderator.  So hopefully the moderator's actions can change to better reflect the tastes of the community rather than catering solely to his own tastes.

But hey, when the party suggests you change the decorations every now and again to something a bit more in the community's tastes it's not a fucking statement about *his tastes* - it's about *our tastes.*  We've seen this guy melt down as the party host for r/mma, and he's stressing out in the same way here.  Maybe it's time for him to stop hosting parties.  Because while I really love this one, I'm certainly not inviting my friends.",,False,self,False,t3_icyzb

I've been a wrestling fan for my entire life. I know it's fake. I also know that it's not as fake as most people think. These guys are strong as hell

Edge recently returned after tearing an Achilles tendon clean off the bone a while back. He was playing heel when he left

Edge is 6-foot-5, wild blonde hair and the best insane/raging/lunatic wide-eyed stare in the business. Over the years he has specialized in some of the more insane gimmick matches WWE has to offer, such as the infamous tables/ladders/chairs match which, well, even if you've never seen one, I bet you can guess what they're like.

But in my opinion some of his best matches ever

Exhibit A would be his match for the World Heavyweight Championship three years ago at Wrestlemania 24

Taker is 6-foot-8 and when he's lean, but I have met him). Late in the match there came a couple of spots where Edge, off balance, had to lift Taker clean off the mat and toss him. Try that for yourself on a consenting adult who weighs 150, and then imagine trying it on someone literally twice that size, on a live pay-per-view seen by millions, in a stadium packed with tens of thousands of screaming fans

When Edge went down with the Achilles injury I thought we might have seen the last of him. When he came back I wrote him a letter congratulating him and wishing him the best

Shortly thereafter

What I did not record, leaned against the ring ropes and talked for a couple of minutes. He apologized to the audience ""if I look a little rusty"" because he was still getting back into shape after the layoff and rehab. He called fan favorites Matt Hardy and Kane tot he ring and shook their hands ""because I haven't been too nice to you guys lately,"" a nice mix of kayfabe and reality that I admired.

He even offered Kane

And then he looked up into the crowd and thanked us for coming and said

I had a good time watching Edge from start to finish. I am deeply saddened that he will no longer be able to do what I know he loves to do

I wish I could shake his hand

So I'll settle for redditing.

Goodbye

I feel part of the problem lays in WWE Superstars.  Yes

Before you laugh

Now a few years ago, Superstars was introduced to feature ""extra"" matches, that were seemingly left off that week's show.

Fast forward 2 years, features many of the same matches, interbrand matches for little or no reason, and absolutely no progression.  Wrestlers* who win one week, will lose the next.  If there's a rematch, odds are that the other guy will win.  And the entire program has little to no recognition outside of those who watch it.  Hell, I'm pretty sure guys have entirely turned only to turn back the next week. (Primo

And on top of it

Raw side:  Zack Ryder, Evan Bourne, Jack Swagger, Drew McIntyre, JTG, David Hart Smith, Goldust

Smackdown! side: Tyson Kidd, Chavo Guerrero

There are other ones that have recently been more featured on the main shows including Justin/Heath, Kozlov..but the point remains the same.

My problem is that these guys are booked on Superstars so often that:

1)  I'm pretty sure nobody recognizes these guys when they're featured on the main shows.
2)  Nobody expects them to last 3 minutes.
3)  These guys are struggling to just make it on the main show

I propose a simple solution:  Feature these guys on the main programs.  Shuffle it around more often....instead of featuring the same tag matches

It just baffles me how WWE's booking is so damn lazy, but what's the point of promoting wrestling as a ""competition"" if pit a wrestler against a Primo.  Who the casual fan will scoff at?    It's one of those booking remnants from the Attitude Era that honestly baffles my mind.",,False,self,t5_2qhk0,False,,

1306311461.0,hjms6,Rant on WWE's main event scene.,TwistedChemical,29,13,88,"Randy Orton and John Cena. These guys are who you think about in this day and age when you think about WWE. The top stars and have been since 2005. Randy Orton with his Legend Killer upbringing to John Cena rapping his way to the top.

I'm not sure about all of you here

When I think of Main Event attractions for WWE. I think of the crazy promo's of Hulk Hogan where he gave off so much energy

You would get won over by each and every one of these guys. They had something about them that caused you to care for them and want to see them win whenever they were in the WWE ring. True main eventers that would have the world tune in to watch them (not just kids)

To me, but it never really worked like that. It's crazy to think back when ECW One Night Stand was happening that John Cena was just as hated as he is today, yet YEARS later, he's doing the exact same thing he was then. There's no depth, there's no personality, just smiles and colors.

This is why I feel WWE decided to target kids as their audience. With kids being their target audience they can put on the worst most bland shows in existence and kids would eat it up because John Cena smiles and wears bright colors. That's really ALL this guy has. He certainly doesn't connect with the older audience and neither does Randy Orton.

The 'Creative Team' haven't put any thought into any of these characters for years. John Cena doesn't even have a main 'heel' to compete against and he hasn't since 2008. His opponents have ALWAYS been 'superstars' that were shot into the main event without any character made for themselves (or it's seemed that way 90 percent of the time). But without a main villain, loses and is done for.

It's nothing new that wrestling borrows from classical mythology and storytelling (the battle between Good and Evil - Face versus Heel). But the current set-up deviates considerably from these usual plots: 

* CM Punk is clearly the protagonist of the story. He's the one proactively chasing the title, consider this: ""a sense of empathy about the character's objectives and emotions is what the audience feels toward the protagonist"" ([Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist))

* John Cena seems to be the [deuteragonist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuteragonist): ""The deuteragonist may switch from being with or against the protagonist depending on the deuteragonist's own conflict/plot."" He's Punk's opponent

* That leaves Vince McMahon in the role of the [tritagonist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritagonist): ""As a character, not wrestling, and he's the one favoring the ""ass-kissers"".

That's it in a nutshell. This isn't my field of expertise though, I thought that the whole protagonist/deuteragonist/tritagonist is a good fit for the three characters. Could this have been intentional? Or is this nothing new?",,False,self,t5_2qhk0,False,,

At what point did the general media and non-wrestling fans start taking things more seriously than WE do? I understand that we live in an age where we try not to offend people. I understand and support that. The issue is
I totally understand that the word ""homo"" is offensive to some. It would be offensive to me as well if I heard it used as a legitimate slur in a public place. The issue is, people will want to see him lose. They'll want to see him lose in a glorious fashion, and hopefully bleed, as well. 

Remember when JBL/Bradshaw got in deep shit for the Hitler salute in Germany during his tag match? That was probably farther than most would have taken it, wrestling is the magnification of real life characters in competition, with people that you would like and not like. Heels get what's coming to them in most cases. Lessons are learned. 

The Heels in wrestling are basically having their tools taken away from them. 
I remember reading a description of a certain night in Japan as told by Dynamite Kid. He was working heel, just being a brat and testing the wrestlers. Dynamite ripped him over the railing, ripped off his shirt, slammed him on the ground, and stomped on him. Legitimately. He DEFINITELY took it too far and spent the night in jail, and was later bailed out by the promoter. 

But who or what was responsible for the instant sellout show that took place the next night?

I got this from www.gerweckn.net, if used correctly of course, either as singles superstars or in a tag team. The possibilities are endless.

Someone on gerweck compared the possible WWE signing of the Kings of Wrestling to the Dudley Boys being signed. ECW was on the verge of a major TV deal and Vince went ahead and signed there tag team champions. Just like ROH is on the verge of a major step toward national exposure and then the WWE goes and gives one of their premiere tag teams a tryout.

* Have the guy wrestle these usual drone matches like most of the matches on the show. Heat--comeback--win sort of deal. No one really looks great. It's just a simple match. 

* The new guy crushes his opponent

In either scenario
I'm not saying that the WWE/TNA needs to fire half of their roster and sub-contract some Mulkey's or something

I definitely talk down about the current product a bit. A lot of us do. I think we have decent reasons to do so. The current main event picture in both main promotions is muddled. The midcard is usually ignored

When I go back and watch complete episodes of RAW from 98 or so, Rock, Taker, New Age Outlaws, all that stuff. Yet, for every memorable angle, there would be some midcard matches that went nowhere. Tag matches with teams that never got over. If you go back further

WCW was the same. For every Goldberg/DDP/Jericho

I guess I noticed that I'm pretty guilty or idealizing wrestling of the past. I think most of us are. We remember great angles with Austin

Cee-Lo Green Concert
 
Emergency match is called to fill time. R-Truth vs. Dolph Ziggler
 
Main Event. Classic match ensues, the hooded and masked wrestler hits the ring, BLASTING HHH in the back of the head, knocking him out. Punk GTS on Cena, emergency ref comes out and hits the three count. Punk retains!
 
Post Match. Mystery Wrestler squares off against Punk, A-Ry, Mysterio, Zach Ryder, even R-Truth. These guys square off against Punk and the mystery wrestler, when suddenly R-Truth and Zach Ryder just start going nuts on Kofi, A-Ry and Mysterio. The beat down is epic

It's got all the parts you need from some classic 90's wrestling drama. I can see the Kings coming in like The Outsiders/DX did and taking the tag titles quickly, only to be squashed by the Kings and Punk (no one would miss Nexus anyway). 

Then the Kings and Punk head over to Smackdown and reveal that Rollins is on their side and Danielson doesn't ""approve"" of that until he cashes in his MITB and then does an about face to join Punk and crew. With both World titles, yo!""

Pairing Rollins with someone for his debut would be really good since he promo skills are lacking. He's the Mark Jackson of the wrestling world

The WWE would be the Sherwood Forest to CM Punk's Robin Hood.

Everyone knows that WWE takes their product very seriously during the January-April, the Summers suck. They couldn't even be bothered to promote MITB [without making a mockery of it, as Jason Powell so aptly pointed out.](http://www.prowrestling.net/artman/publish/powellsblog/article10019134.shtml) 

We all know Summerslam is a major event and Money in the Bank is a huge PPV, June, July Pay-Per-View slots? I say move MITB to November, in place of Survivor Series (which has been in jeopardy of being replaced for years). 

The product has clearly been weaker during the summer months, improve their overall health and come back in better shape for the fall.

1307997405.0,hyt6n,Requests for updates to this subreddit.,,21,10,23,"Just writing this to start a community discussion about the subreddit as it could be great subreddit with a little bit more growth


My personal suggestions are: 

* **Arrows.** To have no down vote arrows for posts. Too many people are downvoting posts based on cyncism of either indie wrestling or large promotional wrestling. Wrestling is wrestling no matter where it's found. I personally try to enjoy most of it and stay open minded

* **Promotion-neutral style sheet** I think the subreddit should have have more of a neutral style sheet. It's well known that JohnHyperion (the moderator) likes wrestling a certain way and the subreddit's style sheet reflects those personal tastes.  And this is fine.. whilst the subreddit is small

* But as the community grows Perhaps a completely promotion-neutral theme would be more appealing to people on their first visit. My first impression was ""great wrestling elitism at it's finest"". I'm not just saying that either

* **Topical banner pic?** Perhaps a wrestling themed alien in the top left? and a topical picture in the top right based on what's current like they do over at /r/soccer. Such as a month ago it could have been a picture of Randy Savage. It should be said though that in general the style sheet is attractive.



* **Addition of moderators** Also this is an open question to JohnHyperion Raising the point about mods. As a subreddit grows it's important to ensure it's *viewed as* a balanced and user friendly environment
