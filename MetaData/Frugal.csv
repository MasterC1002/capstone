I subscribed to /r/frugal, but ever since it has become a popular subreddit, quite frankly it has become a shitty circle jerk. Hell /r/frugal_jerk has started linking directly here and it's hilarious, which is bad for this sub.

I didn't subscribe to see some lady that saved money on makeup because it was on sale. Or see what you picked out of the dumpster. It's awesome that you are able to save money on all these things, this isn't a subreddit to post your ""wins"" it's a subreddit to help others ""win"". 


&gt; The purpose of r/frugal is to share what we have each learned. Let's all work together to keep r/frugal on-topic

I realize this post is contradictory


In resposnse to /u/Maxcactus, some users have took to making new subs. Here are a couple.


/r/frugality - the new /u/Maxcactus -less subreddit for frugal ideas

/r/FrugalWins - pictures of coupons, etc., and hopefully the accompanying stories (not everyone can learn from these, but I think it's okay for people who want to brag about their frugality).

/r/FrugalBestOf - The best tips

/r/CheapAsFuck - for doing things that are the absolute cheapest you can. Basically, sometimes its necessary to be cheap as fuck.



Some more appropriate subs for your consideration:

- seems like there's two factions in this sub: those who choose to be frugal and those who have to be. I hail from the former.

- many people who seem well off encounter an attitude of ""You can afford it!"" when it comes to spending habits. In a lot of cases

I got an entry level job in my field (Computer Science) starting out at 30k/year. As of today

  When I got my first couple paychecks, and just not caring. I was still living at home, so what did I care? $1,800 to a 20 year old with a cell phone bill and student loan is a lot of money. So I bought a computer, spent 400+ every month at the bars, and pretty much wasted my money. 

  After a year of that lifestyle, and disposable income I had every month. After a short year, I had budgeting down to a science. This is when I started noticing what I could accomplish. 

  In those short couple of years,000. I paid off a student loan at the beginning of the year which was a couple thousand. I also stopped smoking which saved me $160/mo.

  At the beginning of the year


  Which brings me to where I am today. 12 short months later,000 in the bank, no car payment, got engaged, and a great feeling of self discipline. I still live on my original paycheck, and my life style hasn't really changed that much from when I first started budgeting. I still go out on the weekends to the bars, but always find myself at the happy hours that offer 50% drinks/food/whatever.

Moral of the story: Budgeting is an extremely powerful tool when used properly. I know most of you already know this

I live on my own and eat for one, and then classify my purchases. So I can honestly promise you that I spend on average about $120 per month on food. If you would like the template for this spreadsheet, send me a PM (edit: Please don't. See below for link). 

Here are my simple rules: 

1.Don’t waste anything

* It is better to buy little

2.Cut your extras by pre-empting your own likely behaviours. 

* It’s easy to avoid buying lunch if you made it the night before and just have to grab it on your way out. It’s easy to cut your junk food, massive amounts of money.
 
3.Learn how to cook. 

* Sorry, for your family’s health, for your wallet, and for your popularity. I highly recommend [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=249k2WymdFc&amp;list=FLv-5_em9J4-DhPdLuBhTdQA&amp;index=2) series by Gordon Ramsay as a good starting point. But the best way to learn how to cook is to actually cook stuff!

* Cooking is actually very simple – once you pick up the basic set of principles

* If you know how to cook

4.My most important rule - Keep a well-stocked pantry of staples, this is easy!

* A big part of this is knowing your local merchants

* Don’t “plan” your meals – eg. “Tuesdays I have chicken” and then go buy chicken

Here are some examples for what I mean. 

**Staple:** Dry egg and rice noodles
**Accessories:** Seasonal veg and cheap cuts of meat to make stir-frys and noodle soups. 

**Staple:** Pasta and tinned tomatoes/cream. 
**Accessories:** Whatever vegetables or meats are on sale. Make creamy or tomato pasta as you so desire. 
eg. Mince is cheap? Sphagetti and meatballs. Chicken is cheap? Creamy chicken and pesto pasta. Bacon is cheap? Pasta carbonara. Tomatoes are cheap? Minestrone soup. 

**Staple:** Museli (my breakfast of choice). 
**Accessories:** Seasonal fruits

* Eating this way also means that you’ll find you’re always eating an interesting, and full of more vitamins, minerals etc. Shopping is also a very quick, painless process that doesn’t involve too many decisions. On sale? Yep, I’m eating that tonight. 

For my final words of advice - I’m frugal by nature, then go right ahead. But why spend money on something that is **not adding value** to your existence?

He started cooking dinner a few times a week and we would all end up eating dinner together.  Before we knew it there were 5 of us that were cooking and eating together 5-6 nights a week.  

Its been over a year now and still going strong

I haven't done the math as to how much I am saving compared to before we started doing this.  But I end up shopping once a month for the group.  I spent 100 last month and 200 this month.  So I chipped in 300 dollars for 2 months of home cooked dinners.  

It is really difficult to cook for two people, the cooking the cleaning the shopping all gets split up among the group so that no-one is over worked.

So I joke and say that it is our hippie commune and we call ourselves the Cornbread Mafia.  

Does anybody else have a situation like this? Or any experience with an actual hippie commune?  Like

(Take from comments) 
REPLY FROM THE MODERATOR: Just in the last week we added over 3000 new members. After moderating /r/frugal for close to 5 years I have arrived at the conclusion that repeated posts are a fact of nature. I have had sidebars filled with what the OP prescribes. Put in lots of time creating a wiki that contains the answers to FAQ. Posted replies that contained hundreds of search results for the repeated question. The end result is that people do not read the sidebar and wiki.
Frugal is what the members make of it so post good content and use your votes to make it a better subreddit. If you don't like a post subject just move along till you see one that is relevant to you.

The lab called to confirm the scan the day before. They also dropped this. ""It'll be $1350.00 **after** insurance. Will you be bringing payment in full?""  

This was so totally out of our realm  of affordability as to be laughable. I knew there had to be something else. So I logged on to the insurance company's site and found their price comparison tool. It allows you to search by a specific procedure or test and aggregates what patients have paid for various services after coverage. So I dialed up providers in our city for CT scans. There were three. There was the hospital

It was a medical imaging office. All they do is MRI, ultrasound, etc. They offer the EXACT same scan for $350.00 after insurance and happily scheduled him for the same time as the old appointment. 

We were in-and-out in 30 minutes and saved about $1000.00. 

tl;dr - Medical pricing is totally arbitrary. Shop around and save.

**Update:** 
Thanks for the kind wishes everyone. The results indicate that a benign cyst has grown on his brain and is causing his symptoms. They've also discovered (from other diagnostic work) that his heart is beating very irregularly. At this point we're looking at pain management and monitoring the cyst. He is going to wear a heart monitor for a few days to get a clearer picture of his cardiac health.  If the cyst grows than we're looking at surgery. His heart may need a pace maker. Whatever happens

- Prioritize. Do you really need a tiny tub of ice cream that's $5? Probably not. Make a basic grocery list. Here's mine! (Chicken legs, frozen veg [4], cheese, eggs, milk, bread, canned goods [4], my husband and I pick our special item. For him, if I really have to.

- LEARN TO COOK. I cannot stress that enough! You'll save so much by not eating out every week. Save some money so you can eat out once or twice a month

- Balance dinner. Dinner is where things, so I was making Hamburger Helpers. I spent money on the meal box and meat for a disappointing dinner we scarfed down completely. No leftovers. What a waste. Now, I buy chicken drumsticks (the cheapest cut where I lived), starch sides, and plenty of veggies. It might seem for expensive upfront, but it will hold you for a while as long as you practice...

- Portion Control. Seems obvious, it's frugal. I like to have boxed mashed potatoes with dinner. Now, each box is separated into two bags. Those bags hold four servings. Since it's just my husband and me, that's perfect for dinner and next day. If it's just you, you might have to play around with the measuring cups. Portion control helps food go much, much farther. It might seem small, but put next to steamed veggies and a meat, and if you are planning to pack up your dinner for later

- Buy in season. When lettuce is in season, but it's up to 5x more for tiny little heads. That's just a quick example. Fruits and veggies can get pretty expensive if you're not careful.

- Save left over veggies in a large zip bag in your freezer. Keep at it until you've got a good amount

- Worst comes to worst. Your pantry and fridge is empty, and it wants to keep functioning. Potatoes, cabbage, and milk will hold you over for a few days. I seriously don't recommend this. It sucks hards. But, my husband and I were forced to for a week and we lived. But, if you are careful, it should never come to that.

- Try to buy generic brands. To be fair, I get a generic brand that $0.64 a liter. I also use generic soaps and shampoos. For me, generic ""looks-like-Head&amp;Shoulders"" works fine. Of course, if you have sensitive skin or scalp, by all means, get what you need. If you need a particular kind of soap, try calling the manufacturer. They're usually more then happy to give slight discounts to repeat customers. My mom gets all sorts of samples for her flare ups that way.

- You don't need every cleaner under the sun. Seriously. You don't. I use a bleach solution in a (marked) squirt bottle. For mopping, a carpet/hardwood floor cleaner (which ever you have).

- Salvation Army is your new best friend. You can hit major gold if you're willing to look. I found my dress heels for $2

- Budget. A good, 20. 50% for essentials (Rent, bills, gas, food), 30% for wants (games, eating out), you may need to modify it slightly

- Save for you time. Budget a few bucks for a new game, if you need gas, then fine, but you're important, too. 

- Carry cash for shopping trips. It's too easy to go over ""just ten extra dollars!"" with a card. That extra money has to come from somewhere. If you're not careful

- If possible, it can be a great investment if everything's tucked in tight around you.

- Roll your budgets over. I had $30 left of from my bills budget because my power and water bill lowered! Score! Free dinner? No. That went towards next months needs as a safety net. You never know when your bills will rise, but I'll hold it for a month if I want something more expensive, like a newly released video game, or a small shopping trip, or I want to visit the Aquarium. My husband and I combined our allowances for two months to buy a yearly pass. Now, we get in for free! :)

- You will mess up. It's gunna happen. No amount of tips in the world can help you if you don't help yourself. So, they were working full time salaried cushy jobs. Me? $2.15/hr as a hostess. Did. Not. Work. Out. Some people are naturally frugal, I proved that I wasn't.

**The secret to your happiness is Ting.com and Google voice.** Ting operates on the sprint network

Here are their rates: https://ting.com/rates
Here is their savings calculator: https://ting.com/calculator

They are unique in that you have no contract, when you log in you see how many minutes you've used and which bucket you fall in.  On their site they have a savings calculator if you are interested.  

So here are the steps: 

1. Order a new phone from Ting at full price
2. Get the phone activated in about 3 minutes from home
3. Sign on to google voice
4. Profit. 

Our bill this month was $21 because we were around Wi-Fi a ton, just used VoIP (Talkatone on a smart phone, but thats another post), texted over 1000 messages, and used near 2 gb of data.  

All in all

Finally, I believe I also get some sort of credit, $25, if you use this, but dont have much experience with it. So if you purchase through this link, an advanced thank you! If not then no worries, and hopefully you enjoy the new phone service!)

**$25 off link** - https://z55r5k1roq3.ting.com/

Biggest win of Ting: My concern was, but the good news is that Ting is one of the few MVNO's that voice roams for free to Verizon.  So you get the prices of Sprint, with the great network of Verizon.

Edit: If you have any questions about the quality of the service let me know! 

Edit 2: They haven't come up yet, for a total savings of $1200 over a typical 2 year contract.  

**Edit 3:** I can't believe I forgot to mention this earlier.  Their web interface is unique in that you can easily set up alerts for all three buckets for the account, you can set it to just turn off when it reaches a certain point.  If you don't want to go above 1000 Mb, you can set data to turn off automatically at that point.  This is amazing, and I bet extremely handy for families with teenagers.  

**Edit 4:** Thank you to everyone for the kind comments!  It is always humorous when one comment says ""This is amazing, and included a disclaimer in the beginning.  The way their system is set up referrals benefit both parties!  I did not intend to deceive, and attempted to make it clear how it worked!  

***Final Update and Summary:*** 
So

1) If you medium to light user

2) If you are a heavy user then the reddit community supports Republic wireless ($19 unlimited everything, and unlimited data and text) or T mobile prepaid ($30 for 100 mins, and unlimited data and text.)  Each of these has their pros and cons.  For us, while these are great deals for unlimited, are usage was such that we can save more with Ting.  However, it seems the breaking point is the 2-3 Gb of data usage between Ting and benefiting from an unlimited plan!

Hope this helped more than a few of you!

- Bought his used truck in 1999; and still drives it today. He's learned to maintain it and keep it in pristine condition over the years. Everything from an oil change to a tire change (Edit: Meant rotating) is done in his Garage. His investment in tools has paid off over the years by doing family and friend jobs for cheap.
- Bought his wife's car used in 2002. She still drives it today as well. 

Eating Out:
- He eats out once a week; and considers $30-$40 a huge deal.
- Only drinks beer on his night out. The only day of the week he does.

Houses:
- He still lives in the first house he ever purchased. He made a large down payment on it and then paid off more than the monthly minimum until it was paid for.
- As a side job he started flipping houses. At first he paid for them; and as time went on he funded the houses while letting others work on  them.
-His exact words regarding house payments: ""The shorter time you have one
-He pays for his houses by taking out a home equity loan on the one he lives in. 

Investments:
- Mutual funds: His reasoning is that he doesn't have to or want to spend the time learning and watching stocks daily. He'll let the professionals do it for him. 

Television:
-His TV is from 2002 or so. His reasoning for never upgrading is why? I can still see it from my chair and I understand everything I'm seeing. Nothing looks bad and I haven't had any problems with it.

If this catches on a bit; I'll write some more of what he's said. I don't want to waste my time spreading some of his knowledge if it lacks interest.

Edit with more of things he does and some background on him and his wife:
He's been an AC repairman until retiring; she's a former executive at a larger corporation. Both worked their way up in their respective jobs. He had no college degree; she went to night school while working at the office during the day for years. Both retired around age 52. 

Hobbies:
- They both still do spend some money on their hobbies; over the years he's collected guns. He used to have a boat (that was too expensive for him to upkeep). He bought a 1999 motorcycle in 2002 or 2003 and still has it in pristine condition. My Uncle enjoys fishing; and as of recently has taken up exercising and reading. She likes to walk and exercise as well. Also has taken up reading with him. They both got their first library cards a few months ago.

Attitude:
- He enjoys his life. My aunt and uncle have never been into anything all too fancy and enjoy the easy things in life. They're comfortable with their lives and are fine with how they live. They don't have any desire to get any crazy luxuries because they didn't grow up wanting or needing them. Why start now?

Gas:
- Around here there's a grocery store that gives gas points based upon money spent. 2x points (and occasionally 4x points) per dollar spent. Every 2000 points can be used to take $2.00 off a gallon of gas, after the points off, becomes $1.50 a gallon. ($3.50x35 = 122.50 after money off $1.5x35=$52.50). Saving money he wouldn't have otherwise.

Vacationing:
- They tend to use others homes they know. Her family has houses in places like Michigan and Florida. Why pay a hotel when you can stay in a family place for free? 

Edit #2:
401K/Pension:
- After having paid into these plans for years; on top of having no house payment; no car payments; and no debts; my uncle estimates they live on around $40

Retirement:
- He's been reading up on the cost of retirement and figures this is where most of his money will end up going. With medical bills, but he's seeing it as lasting him another 30-40 years down the road.

Edit #3:
Banks:
- Banks are more willing to cater to you; the more money you have vested in them. My uncle didn't like the interest rate he was getting at one. He went in and asked for them to raise it a bit higher because of the size of his investment (around $250
- Also (tip of his for the very wealthy already) don't put all of your money into one bank. Spread it between various ones as each account can only be secure for up to x amount (I think $100

$4 - 1lb sausage - I like the long rope italianish ones (Google Premio for an example)
$2 - 1lb brocolli crowns  
$2 - 1 10oz box of plain Cous Cous (such as Near East brand)
$2 - Miscellaneous cost:  olive oil, black pepper, spinach, red pepper flakes, chicken boullion, basil, onion

In a pan or grill pan, and cook 'til it's done throughout.  If you like onions, while this is cooking, slice an onion into 1/8"" thick rings and toss in the pan.  Stir them around occasionally so they don't burn.

While that's happening

Put the pot back on a medium range and pour 3-4T of dark olive oil into it (the darker the better).  When that's warm, but enough to get rid of the strong pungent overtones.

Add 2c of water to the pot, some dried basil and black pepper, stir in, and dump in the box of cous cous.  Turn off the heat, stir this together, and cover the pot tightly.

While the cous cous cooks (5 minutes), the brocolli, onions and sausage.  Add some spinach if you want...I put in about 2-3oz of chopped frozen spinach.  It's a cheap non-obnoxious way to add more veggies to my diet.  Stir together, let it cool for a few minutes, and portion out.

Reasonable protein, you can give the water more time to boil, and mix in finely sliced celery or carrots, etc, and add the cous cous when they're tender.  Fresh tomatoes added after cooking are good of course.

This makes 5-6 hearty portions.

Edit:  I'm sorry if there's no lentils, or if it's not a mashed potato and miracle whip sandwich, or if you didn't know to make a candle out of a can of tuna in oil, or if it's sausage, or if it's not a meal-replacement shake or if you don't like eating the same thing every day.

1367090617.0,1d8ayw,A reasonable list of things that have helped me be frugal.,Chess01,1416,390,360,"Feel free to add ideas!

1. Take the ""Pay yourself first"" ideology, and survive off of only Income - X

2. Don't be cheap:  Buying a higher quality item that I know I'm going to use for years has saved me more money over time than buying several cheap items after they break.

3.  Avoid memberships like Sams Club and Costco.  Yes, or have a large family depending on you, you don't save enough on non-perishables to make up for the yearly membership (**this one is subjective guys**).  EDIT:  If you have a family member with a membership, select a day of the week to borrow it and get the benefits of the membership without the annual fee, or offer to split it with them.  That way, you can get non-perishables and things that you can freeze, and help them out a little too!

4.  Do activities that are either a. free or b. already paid for.  Example:  I have a large board game and card game collection, and it's social!  

5.  Thrift Stores. Get over any pride you have concerning thrift stores

6.  Track your spending.  While this seems obvious

7.  Check your local subreddit at least once a week.  This has helped me out a lot.  I can often find local people willing to sell things cheaply, and saves you money while entertaining you.

8.  Wait 1 week before buying something you think you need, I usually don't end up buying it.

9.  Timers on ""vampire"" outlets.  Electronics that are ""passive"" users cost you a lot of money in a year.  For less than $10 on amazon

10.  Give yourself a hard impulse cap.  Everyone likes to buy stuff, or how many months you have to wait to get it.  You reward yourself for your willpower.

11.  Have a frugal partner.  This one is tricky

12.  Use your credit card for as many purchases as possible.  Many credit cards offer a points reward or cash back incentive.  So at the same time as building credit, and you wont have to pay interest ever!

13.   Coupons!  Get those scissors out folks.  Coupons save a lot of money over a year

14.  Coupons 2.0.  Have a junk email to sign up for promotional deals with.  Example: If you know you like icecream, you're saving money.

15.  Grocery store membership cards.  They're free, you buy groceries often at local places.  My wife and I probably have 6 diferent little membership cards, and over a year or two, they actually add up.  Smith's savings membership is one of my favorites.

16.  Craigslist.  Seriously

17.  Fresh is cheaper than canned.  People don't seem to understand this often, chop it, dry it, and bottle it.  problem solved.

18.  Have frugal friends.  If your close group of friends are people who like doing free and/or nearly free or already paid for stuff, you're going to have a very expensive social life.

19. Track your savings.  Earlier I said track your spending

20.  Personal finance phone apps.  When you're out for a night on the town it's hard to keep track of what you're spending, and won't let you surpass it in the math.  That's when you know to skip dessert or say no to that last beer.

21.  I'm going to end it here because I have to go to work, but for $15 a month you can 1. go as often as you like 2. Look better 3. Feel better 4. Be healthier 5. Be happier 6. Meet people.  The benefits are enormous, and I honestly believe being HEALTHIER and HAPPIER will save you a lot of money in the later years of your life (although there is no guarantee).  Not to mention you'll feel better every day.

22.  (Contributed by odd84).  MAKE MORE MONEY.  Now, to make lateral moves into departments with more upward mobility, to be on the look out for other employment opportunities in the area where they would be paid more, etc.
There are a great many jobs where simply switching employers every few years would yield a much higher wage increase than a below-inflation annual raise would ever add up to in their current job. There are a great many people who could make a move from a low-skill profession where there are 10 candidates for every opening
You might also have the opportunity to fix up and rent out a room in your home. To turn a hobby into a side business with eBay/etsy/your own online store. To take hard-earned professional experience and turn it into a consulting business of your own. Heck, IF YOU HAVE MORE MEANS!

1337095469.0,tob1g,A list of things I have learned from R/Frugal,thefingolfin,1319,325,446,"First time posting here
Here are some of the tips and plans for saving money that I have gathered from this subreddit:

**–Cook good and healthy food for less:**
Fruggit has been wonderful in promoting this. Crock-pots/Slow-cookers are your friend. So are dried beans, but never sells some of the nicer items. (organic items, good cheeses, etc) When they get close to the end of the shelf life, the store discounts then by 50% to get them off the shelves. Because of this I've adjusted my purchasing schedule to shop there 1-2 times a week, buying fresh fruits/veggies/etc and whatever is dramatically discounted, and then plan meals around this.

**–Get a chest freezer:** 
Gives you the space to take advantage of really cheap food deals

**–Get a cheaper cell phone plan:** 
This is a hard one for me. My wife has 22% off at Verizon, so we likely will switch when our contract is us in 6 months, but it's only a savings of $7-$10 a month. I need to make sure that the coverage and extra features of a pre-paid phone plan are worth it.
However

**–Make your own laundry detergent:** 
It only took me about an hour to make a powdered detergent from Borax, 1 cup and ½ bar respectively) 
There are tons of recopies. [This is the one I used](http://www.diynatural.com/homemade-laundry-detergent-soap/) Rough cost estimates for me were 900 loads for ~$20. Cheapest equivalent was Aldi's detergent at 360 loads for $25.

**– Look for cheaper means of transportation:**
With each of us having jobs, and after school tutoring programs it's not yet been practical for us to move down from two vehicles. I have long fantasized about owning a moped/scooter that's under 50cc  so I could get rid of my terrible car (which with some DIY mechanical work I have somehow kept running) and have an insurance/title free vehicle along with a main car. This may never happen, but would provide a significant amount of savings. We also don't have a good means of public transit.

**–Brew your own alcohol: (Well... at least beer and wine...)**
[r/Homebrewing](http://reddit.com/r/homebrewing) is awesome. I've just started testing the waters of brewing with some 1 gallon test batches of apfelwein. (apple wine) Ciders and meads don't usually require boiling, after the ~$150 initial purchase, your batches will run between $20-$40 for 50-60 bottles of beer that's better than from the store. It's not for everyone, but it's a hobby I'm interested in, and will save money in the long run.

**–Start putting into place energy efficient items in your house:**
I've read countless good ideas for this. Here are a few: 
Smart power strip for TV set ups(Saves about $12/yr) 
 CFL bulbs
Water saving shower heads (already using so it won't be an adjustment)
Water Saving Toilet systems: Dual Flush Kit (Or even putting a 2-liter filled with water into your tank to reduce water usage. I like having the full/half flush option)


**–Don't pay for cable
I will have to use Comcrap cable services for internet because they are the only thing in the area. I will definitely buy a modem (it will cost about $40) instead of renting one for $5 a month.
Instead of a cable package get a Roku player (~$50-$60 if you look for a cheap model refurbished or on sale
Assuming Comcast doesn't play the “force you to bundle with a 'basic cable' package of over-the-air channels for a dollar or two more than just internet which you're not allow to buy ala carte” game

**–Restore or build your own furniture:**
I've recently started getting my feet wet in some DIY projects. ([r/DIY](http://reddit.com/r/DIY) is a great as well) I build a headboard for our bed for under $50. A friend gave us a large wooden spool that my wife and I are going to convert into a table/bookshelf combo. With a few tools

**– Exercise outside of a gym:**
Paying for a gym membership in my opinion can be a frugal option if it makes you exercise

–(For those who have a good handle on their spending) **Use a rewards credit card instead of a debit card:**
I fully understand this is not a good idea for some people. I could tell you several of my friends who I would specifically recommend to not use a credit card. However, the $300 sign-up bonus and the 1-5% cash back on purchases has been a nice source of extra money, and hasn't increased our spending at all.

**– Use Open-office and Google Docs instead of Microsoft Office:**
While some people need the extra features that Microsoft Office provides (Such as Excel... can't really get a comparable substitute)

**– Get your personal finances in order:**
To echo what seems to be the mantra of [r/personalfinance](http://reddit.com/r/personalfinance): Get out of debt, then start investing in indexed mutual funds. Make the money you've saved work for you.
I think Scott Adam's (Dilbert Cartoonist) 9-point plan to personal finance is an easy and clear way that explained the basics tenets of personal finance

Thanks so much for sharing your insight and stories. It's definitely encouraging to see that I'm not the only one who wouldn't feel guilty about spending some extra $$$ for the peace of mind.

The current people I live with are a 65-year-old lady with medical problems who is a work-from-home psychic of some kind. She once told me that she ""talks to the angels""....very weird.

I'm sorry

I had no idea it would attract so many comments. I honestly didn't. I was completely shocked when I logged in this morning and saw over 300 comments. It was a bit of a nasty shock

Because of the sheer number of comments and upvotes, and she put the pieces together and called me. I am so embarrassed. I really regret posting this. My friends don't know that I live this way. I never have them over to my place. I wear nice clothes and nice makeup when I'm with them, and they have no idea I live so cheaply. Two of my other friends know now, too. One of them has asked me if I need her to loan me some money so that I can spend more on food. I am so embarrassed. I never intended for my friends to see this side of me. I wanted them to think that I am a pretty girl with a great life and little problems; I spent so much time during my first few years of college adopting this outer shell, this aspirational identity, because I was so sick of being the depressed ugly quiet mousy Asian girl in bulky secondhand clothes in high school. I never intended for anyone to find out that I used to sleep on the same mattress with my mom and my brother, that I eat the same thing two days in a row, foolishly thinking no one from real life would see this, like a woman from China I knew who ate nothing but ramen for months to afford a real Chanel bag.

If you will believe nothing else about this post, not a troll, and reading some of the comments and the messages in my inbox that really berated me and put me down and called me names like anorexic and famished and eating shit food made me cry. **I'm not victimizing myself here, nor am I saying this is cyberbullying - it is not near those levels!** I'm just saying I can't handle being here and reading these comments and checking my inbox anymore because I'm much more emotionally fragile than the average 21-year-old. My family is nice to me, and so are my friends. I never got picked on. I've never been in a real physical or verbal fight. No one has ever said things to me like the things that have been said to me here. I freaked out and I just can't handle it anymore. I'm really trying to calm myself down as I'm writing this because I am upset and I think it would look even more stupid and immature if I started typing out expletives right now which have been drifting in and out of my mind.

That being said. I saw a lot of great advice on here and I thank you. I'm going to raise my budget and try out more food types. I'm going to start calculating my calorie intake to make sure I'm actually eating healthy. I'm still going to keep up my daily exercise

As I am typing this out I like to think that we are sitting across from each other

I appreciate everything even though this has been a humiliating disastrous mistake for me. The thought of going to class tomorrow and facing people I know is twisting at my stomach.

2.  for the last 6 months or so, but it could only take 91 octane gas.  it got to the point where it was costing about $200 a month in parts and repairs, even doing them all myself.  add to that the $70 a week in gas, payment, and insurance on a BMW, and this car was pushing almost a grand a month.  time to trade her in.  she got a new car, with warranty, but 30$ a month cheaper to insure
3.  i didn't get a very good interest rate on my truck when i bought it.  a divorce can be hard on your credit rating.  when the bank ran our credit for the lady's car, i was right side up on the truck, so i asked if they could finance some extra.  even with the extra, it dropped my truck payment by a full 175 a month.  

4.  the extra i got on the truck loan went straight back to the same bank

We drove by one of the local car dealerships and saw it sitting in the back

So, but only had 60,000 miles on it. Very well maintained. Their price was $10,700. I told them that since the vehicle was 10 years old, take off $100 for every year, so $1,000. I told them I would need to buy new tires at $200/tire, my offer was $8, maybe?"" I told them no

They called almost every day,000 that I wasn't interested and to not call me back and if they did, I would file a harassment complaint. They called back two days later and agreed on $8,000. 6 months later, they got bought out by a bigger company.

So, he saw a truck on Craigslist that he liked. 2008 Dodge Dakota crew cab(4 door). He wanted $9,000(KBB value was a little over $10,000) so I emailed him and he said that he was away on business but his wife was home and she could show it to us. So, I got his address and we went to look at it. 

This guy lived out in the middle of nowhere. It took us almost 2 hours down dirt roads to get there. His wife let us test drive it down the driveway and I noticed that it had 117, the yearly average mileage on this truck is 23,400 miles which is almost DOUBLE the recommended yearly driving of 12,000 miles.

I emailed the guy and told him we looked at it,500. This is my calculation why I offered him that low. Being generous, I figure someone will drive a vehicle 12,000-15,000 miles a year, so going with the high number(15,000),000 miles. For instance,000 which is 42,000 miles over

Sorry about all the math

Every week, he was down to $7,400 so he emailed me back.

me: oh

guy: no

me: Yes

guy; come on man

me: yes

**Edit - To Consider:**

* Receiving broken parts (look at the return policy when ordering online). 
* You may not get a warranty with the mechanic (you have to decide whether the benefits outweigh the potential cost).
* Some mechanics may not like this because you are removing one source of their income. Be sure to review the bill so that you are not getting charged more in other areas (shop around/get quotes so that you are clear what the final bill will be).

1289317574.0,e3i8m,Make cheap Thai style food fast.  How to make 4 basic sauces.,cephaloman,1047,275,260,"I live in an area of the US where Thai food is unreasonably expensive.  $12 for a single serving vegetarian green curry is not unexpected.  This is a far cry from the $7-$8 dishes I could get back in Detroit that would feed me for two big meals.  I had to figure out how to do this myself.   I will show you how to make 4 sauces: Prig Khing

What you need:
Sugar
Soy Sauce or Salt
Fish Sauce (Very cheap)
Lime Juice
Coconut Milk (lite or regular)
Coconut Flakes (for moisture control)
Peanut Butter
Thai Curry paste(red and green)

Your Thai Curry paste is the key.  Do not use the Thai Kitchen junk you find in grocery stores.  Go to an Asian store and get the Mae Ploy brand or Maesri.  They look identical  [Link for image](http://www.importfood.com/cpmp1404.html).  Buy the 14 oz tubs or get the 35oz if you eat Thai often.  These pastes can be used for many things.  The 4oz tins seem to have far less flavor so I would stay away from them.  Expect to pay $4-7 in a store.  One tub will last you 20 or more meals so this stuff is cheap.  They don't seem to go bad but loose some flavor after a couple months or so.  I always keep red curry and green curry around.

All these dishes follow this format so I will just outline the sauces 
1) Make sauce in a bowl
2) Cook vegetables (and meat/tofu)
3) Add sauce to cooked vegetables in pot/wok and heat through
4) If the sauce is too watery
5) Eat.

Green or red Curry:  Combine the following.
1/2 can (shaken) coconut milk
3/4 cup water
1-2 tbs green or red curry
1 tbs lime juice
1-2 tbs sugar
4-5 shakes of fish sauce
Salt/soysauce to taste 

Peanut butter Sauce:  Combine the following.
1/2 cup peanut butter
1 tbs red curry
1/2 tbs lime juice
1-2 tbs sugar
4-5 shakes of fish sauce
Whisk warm water in small increments till it turns into a loose sauce. 

Prig Khing Sauce: 
3 tbs red curry
1 tbs lime juice + 1-2 tbs water
2 tbs sugar
4-5 shakes of fish sauce
Salt/soy sauce to taste
Toss with cooked green beans and choice of protein over heat.

(edited for spacing issues)

EDIT:  These sauces are spicy.  If you don't normally eat Thai then you might want to start with only 1tsp of curry instead.

EDIT: Vegan.  Shelled Edamame is awesome as a protein in Thai dishes.  Just skip the fish sauce and it's still very good.   Try mushroom or kombu broth instead of water to add some Umami.  The Kombu will ad a slight fishy flavor to replace the fish sauce.

Taking the advice of other redditors, and we have only spent 223.52 so far in February and that includes a bottle of wine and a bottle of whiskey. I know we will probably need to make another small run to the grocery store this month for some fresh veggies/fruit and maybe bread if I don't have time to make it. 

Things I've done to cut the bill:

1. Track every penny on a spread sheet

2. I make a meal plan once a week, which I was already doing, but now I'm packing better/healthier snacks and I'm less tempted to buy pre-packaged lunch items. 

3. I cut pop out completely

4. I still buy my meat at Costco

5. I only make one large shopping trip a month, I force myself to come up with something to use them in, or cook and freeze them for later use. We do make 1-2 other small trips in the month to get fresh veggies and fruits and odd ingredients.

6. Cut out a lot of alcohol

7. We include paper products, but we were going through paper towels very quickly, so we have started using old rags for spills and such and just throwing them in the washer throughout the week and end up washing them with our other laundry and that has cut down on our paper wasting significantly. 

8. Home made bread and pizza crust. I received a mixer for Christmas and started using it to make desserts as well, plus the flour is really cheap at Costco as well. I buy a jar of the yeast at Kroger for a few bucks and that is pretty much all you need to make the beginnings of a cheap pizza. We eat pizza about 1 time a week, with leftovers for a snack or lunches.

&gt;AT&amp;T is actively putting into place ~~bandwidth restrictions~~ data limits (both mobile and on the U-Verse platform (which we also use)) that are completely unacceptable. We can avoid some of these ~~bandwidth restrictions~~ data limits by sticking with 3G coverage and thus hold onto our grandfathered unlimited plan, and suck on the data limits on the new ""Faux-G"".~~ {see note 2 below}  And what limits they are! 2G per month download, or about half an hour of HD Video which my new Atrix smart phone can play over HDMI to my TV.

I started budgeting early this year (earning $1.5k/mo) and reduced my credit card debt from $1,800 to $300, while paying off $5,000 of tuition for Spring semester and reaching my short term savings goal of $1,000 (more details inside).",1045,"[Here is a graph of my credit debt over time.](http://i.imgur.com/uYRJAbm.png)

You can tell I didn't care about my credit card debt until a few months ago.  It's incredible how much a little planning and self discipline can get you! For context, but I'm just happy I have my credit card debt under control.

As an added bonus

Another perk of budgeting means that I can pay out of pocket for important expenses.  I'll soon be moving to a different city to start a PhD (tuition scholarship + health insurance!) and I've secured an apartment (first month's rent + security deposit).

I wish I could say more about what I've done to save money in terms of technology.  For example

NB: The math in the title won't work out too well

EDIT: more context since everyone is making funny assumptions. My family is very poor so we get a ton of financial aid in the form of loans and grants. The school I go to is good about that kind of thing

Each year tuition costs upwards of 50k. Grants and loans cover most of it

Due to my low cost of living I was able to do everything in the title this semester alone. In the Fall semester I was spending all my extra money on random crap I don't even use anymore. This semester I took all my extra money and put it to paying off debt. I hope this clears up the confusion.

And the most insulting suggestion here is that I take money from my parents. That's not the case. I'd never ask for money from my parents who are no better off than I am.

I've been living in an environment where me and my family count every forint (hungarian currency) and watch where we spend

I could buy boots for about 2000 Fts (~10 dollars) but let me tell you one thing. I had *these* kind of boots for ten years and what I can say is that many times

I had to buy a new boots every 3 month or so, buying the ""very expensive"" boots (which is in PERFECT condition over 2 years of use) turned out to be the CHEAPER choice.

So our family now thinks this way every time we buy something. WE went so far

The rules are simple: 

*Go to a gas station/grocery store and buy a candybar to get $5 cash back, it's also easier to do a sudden death if you already have the exact amount.*

*Whoever can find the coolest thing for $5 wins. Visit thrift stores, if you purchase to soon you may miss out on something later! That's the gamble! (in our case it was something to furnish our apartment for next year when we move)* 

*The item can cost anything up to $5.99 with tax

*Ties go to the cheaper item if comparable coolness.*

*Sudden death (if necessary) is whoever can find something to buy with the remaining change or about $3. (how much we had left and seemed like a tougher challenge to decide the winner)*

We ended up getting a cool wine coaster for putting your bottle of wine on a table while hosting ($4)

This week we're going to start the $10 Challenge dinner! Who can make the tastiest dinner this week? (hopefully with enough leftovers to go a night and lunch) This challenge can easily apply to any spending. Who can be the most efficient?

Edit: As snutr mentions, I spend waaaaay less than this on housing and I don't have life insurance. So these differences can be added somewhere else (savings for example). I also spend more on transportation than this budget calls for, which I can't really do anything about so I just have to understand that.

accounts really allowed me to get my act together. ",235,190,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/10pxuh/a_letter_i_recently_wrote_to_a_friend_who_just/,"Now that you have some serious **$$$,$$$'s** rolling in let me offer some advice I wish I had right away. Take it or leave it. Fuck, throw it away and come back to it in a year or two and go party you earned it. Seriously

**Budget**. Use free accounts and direct deposit to do all the work. My paycheck is deposited in 3 different accounts plus a 401k and reimbursement checks into a 4th account. Do your budget monthly.  Your paychecks are probably every other week.  The result is 2 months out of the year all your accounts will get a ""bump"" from the extra paychecks that month (26 paychecks a year vs 24 if it were 2 a month). The exact details might differ for you but the principles are all the same so pay attention. 

**401k**. Contribute whatever money your employer will match. Free money
  
**Bill Pay Checking** (free local credit union w/ online bill pay):  
Put all your bill money into this account, student loans, utilities, gas, train pass, insurance, everything except food), welcome to the 21st century.  
  
**High Yield Savings**. (free local credit union):
Try and maximize. Don't spend...unless buying a house or ski resort.  
  
**Play Checking**. (Schwab account
Sex
  
**Reimbursement**. (free local credit union w/ online bill pay)   
Deposit all business expense checks here, rental cars, meals, gas etc. Pay all those bills with a cash back credit card and pay back weekly when reimbursement checks come in. 
  
**Personal Results**. (your mileage will vary)  
401k: It grows quicker than you expect. Even in down economies if your employer matches you are immediate up. The economy would have to be totally fucked to make this a bad investment and in that case the size of your ammo collection matters more than your 401k.  
  
Bill pay.  You never worry about bills. You over estimate and the ""bump"" pads it even more. It's not uncommon to have a couple thousand dollars padding in here and all of a sudden your season lift pass is a ""bill.""  
  
Savings.  Buy property with 20% down and it's cheaper than rent. Buy a ski condo or a duplex. Fuck you money
  
Play Account. If you are trying to buy a ski resort hold back and transfer any left overs in this account to your savings account each pay period. If you want to buy the latest tablet or powder ski let it build for a few weeks.  
  
Reimbursement. Pays all business expenses plus maintenance on the truck

**Expert level tips**:  
Link every account online with every other account to enable quick transfers. Online bill pay lets you pay anyone with a check
  
Pay everything with a % cash back credit card and immediately payoff in full each week.  I received $500 cash back in the last year on $0 in interest/fees. Deposit in savings account.   

Frugal doesn't mean cheap. A $300 pair of shoes can last your life with a couple $100 cobbler visits. A $50 pair of shoes can be worn out in 6 months. Or that same $50 shoe
 
After you pay off your vehicle keep ""paying"" the payments Save it. Pay for the next in cash. Take what very little you need out to maintain and upgrade current paid off vehicle. 

Bill budget about equal to Savings budget &gt; Play budget

We live in Australia where supermarket prices can be twice as much as the US (source: one of us is from the US).  We eat quite well and not just beans &amp; rice.  Thought this might interest fellow aussies

Main points (already well covered in this subreddit)

* eating minimal meat

* making food from scratch

* having the time and interest to do this

* not eating out

* buying fruit &amp; veg at ethnic/discount supermarkets (eg Aldi

This is what we eat:

Breakfast - cereal &amp; fruit with homemade soy milk or homemade yogurt

Lunch - sandwiches on homemade bread or wraps or left overs

Dinner - examples from the past few weeks include thai curry, pasta, pizza, chinese, moroccan vegs &amp; couscous, vietnamese spring rolls, etc.

Snacks - fruit, tea &amp; biscuits, etc

Instead of meat we eat eggs, TVP (texturised vegetable protein) and heaps of vegetables. We make our own bread, yogurt, pasta, pizza dough, bean sprouts, soy milk, etc.  Can't wait for the garden &amp; chickens to get going!

(We are not poor - we just love cooking &amp; living simply which results in more freedom and less stress on the job front)

So it is possible to live quite cheaply in Australia

I can say that the number thing that has helped me become more frugal in the last few months has been to keep my home clean.

- It saves money on cleaning products because if you KEEP it clean you don't have to buy expensive products to cut through all the grime. A simple wipe down with a wet rag will do.

- Clean your cat litter more often and your cat will like you more and you'll use less litter. 

- It saves money at the store because when my home is clean and organized I know exactly what I have and don't have so I stopped buying duplicates.

- Lastly, go out to eat, go party, and come back only when it was time to go to sleep so I wouldn't have to deal with being here. I spent a lot of money to get out of the house. Now that my house is clean, I enjoy spending time in it. :) I also enjoy asking my friends over, whereas before that was an impossibility. They also enjoy that rather than go spend $25 on drinks and food, we can eat here and watching something on Netflix and $25 will buy us ALL drinks. We also avoid the risk of someone getting a DWI from driving around downtown intoxicated. :)

I think that no matter how nice of a place you live in,,False,,t5_2qhbe,False,,True

[Photo of outside of house](http://thescraphouse.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/2010-06-19-14-09-27.jpg)

Since I was very young I have had a passion for dumpster diving, I was taking a drafting class with four students. We were playing around on some CAD software we had, and me and another student decided to try and design the smallest livable house we could conceive. We both came up with a design we really liked, blended them, and agreed on a final plan. I started thinking ""How hard can it be to build?"" 

I talked with our teacher, but we have absolutely no funding. Not even to buy pencils, much less this."" My response was, ""No problem, I got this.""

Every day after class I'd get in my decrepit '84 Landcruiser and make my rounds. The town dump, sinks, doors, windows, etc. The dump had my cell number on speed-dial and would call me if they had something. The waste was amazing. I once climbed in the dumpster of a local Mcmansion being built and found 27 8' 2X6's. Uncut, tag still on them, not warped. They had literally been bought, and thrown away. Some windows were old, siding

While not 100% complete, has power, etc. While the labor is a huge factor, it's amazing how much can be done for so little money. Not accounting for tools of course, but still,... 

The best part is, the walls are straight, the wiring works as it should, etc. Let me know what you guys think. I hope to finish it next time I have a break from school, hence why the blog hasn't been updated in a while. All in good time. 


EDIT: Answering a couple of questions that everyone seems to ask.

Is it built to code? Technically, no code enforcement. That being said, it is built stronger than code in many areas. My next door neighbor is the building inspector, and he's checked it and says it's great. Hurricanes are a regular occurrence, I didn't cut corners.

Secondly, I used gas scavenging. But there are a couple factors. Driving to Home Depot to buy lumber still uses fuel, so it's not an expense specific to **this** house. Secondly, I used to go driving after school anyway, I enjoy it, so it wasn't a burden. I derived pleasure from the driving, so it's kind of an entertainment expense. I was also working in a small, radius. I'd estimate I drove 15 extra miles everyday because of this project. Over 60 days, honestly.

Lastly, screws, paint, cabinet hinges, etc, except the light switches which is what I spent the $8 on. But the labor is intense. I could have saved a lot of time of time by buying stuff. I don't claim for this to have been an efficient exercise, it was simply a challenge I set out.

**Rent - $312**

I live with my girlfriend less than a mile from our university. We both have bikes. Rent is $625 and we split it equally. For some that don't have the advantage of having a SO to split the cost of living with; I also have friends that rent a room in a house from $200-$400


**Utilities- $15** 

If you have a low income you can get financial assistance with your utilities. I live in California and thus use PG&amp;E. My GF and I are on their [CARE program](http://www.pge.com/myhome/customerservice/financialassistance/). Our bill would be nearly twice as much if we weren't on this program. We also


**Food - $70**

This is really where most of my number crunching comes in. I actually built a program that analyzes receipt data and allows me to keep a database of the average cost of my groceries from various grocery stores. Then I can make a grocery list and automatically get a list of the cheapest places to buy from. You don't really need a program for this though. Just remember what things are more expensive where.

I'm a skinny 6'3"" 22 year old and I can put down a lot of food. I probably pack away at least 2500 calories a day. What we usually end up buying are a LOT of frozen vegetables (probably 6-8 pounds a month) that we mix in to our various dishes. Usually peas, or make a delicious vegetable soup out of them. We also use chicken as our main meat which we get from Costco at $1 a pound. We throw it into our casseroles and omelettes usually. My girlfriend has also recently been on a chicken/cabbage pot sticker craze. A 20lb bag of chicken from Costco lasts us 3 months.

Cabbage and Onion are also REALLY inexpensive, and freeze half of it for when we're too lazy to do more cooking.

When we do cave in and indulge in some Ramen

Also, throw some cabbage on that and you have a delicious sandwich!

With all that said

The most popular things in our diet are: eggs, brown rice, flour tortillas, chicken, whole grain bread, broccoli, peas, and cabbage.


**Internet - $15**

We've been on the ""Introductory Rate"" from Comcast for 2 years. We have 20Mb/s internet. Call them up


**Phone - $27**

I'm grandfathered in to Virgin Mobile's $25/month plan. I've had my Optimus V for 2 years. Nothing fancy


**Laundry - $5**

Really


**Transportation - $2**

I live less than a mile from school, but that is literally the only place I ever drive. Fuel costs are near negligible because it's maybe only 5 miles away.


**Textbooks - $0**

That's right. This semester I have paid $0 for books. How you ask? Some good googling and if that fails


**Misc - $50**

Those unavoidable costs. $50 might seem a little high, because there are some months where I'm forced to spend $100 on some bullshit.

As far as keeping those misc costs down. Just follow some common sense. For example

Breakfast is a big one for us...we're both not morning people and eating breakfast much less preparing it usually does not happen.

We tried it out today and I was surprised how cheap it ended up being!


**63 breakfast burritos for 23.14!**

Cost broken down:

* 1 lb colby jack cheese (2.79)
* 2 lbs pork sausage (5.08)
* 32 eggs (4.33)
* 2 lbs hashbrowns (2.50)
* 63 tortillas (5.92)
* 63 fold over sandwich bags (1.17)
* Box of ziploc freezer bags (1.50)

We basically followed [this method](http://cdm-arewethereyet.blogspot.com/2012/04/breakfast-burritos.html) to make them. Instead of using plastic wrap which I hate working with we shoved each burrito into a fold over sandwich bag so that the fold of the bag would follow the roll of the burrito to help keep it shut. That may sound like a ""Duh!"" thing but I shoved 3 of those damn burritos in the other way before having that light bulb go off.

2 of these is pretty filling and each night we will pull them out to pop into the microwave in the morning on the way out.

* The air conditioner running is your enemy.  We will do our best to minimize this sin.
* The amount of time it's on is just a cumulative thing.  One hour or ten six-minute spurts counts for the same thing.
* Your house ""loses cold"" proportional to the temperature difference between inside and out.

This is what we did last summer.  I'll try to lay it out like a normal day so there's some order.

When you wake up, as cold as you possibly can.  For every extra bit of warmth you make for hot water, you're going to pay for it twice because you will then run the air conditioner to make it cool again.  Also hot showers are much bigger generators of shower steam that will unpleasantly coat your bathroom with moisture.  Your air conditioner dehumidifies the air in your house, so if we're going to be using it very little, our secondary battle to fight is to minimize the amount of humidity we introduce to the house.

Before you leave for work, they're all going to generate waste heat all day, that you will wish wasn't in your house when you get home.  Turn off your air conditioner - there's no use for it if nobody's in the house - and close all windows, blinds, and curtains before you leave.

Don't have a job, and follow these same instructions.  This isn't strictly frugal, but if you're going to see movies or go to restaurants anyway, do lunch, and matinee shows, and stay in their magnificently cooled buildings.  Get your shopping done in the daytime.  Go to the library, pool

Now you're done with work and your quotidian activities.  You will come home and find that the house is significantly warmer than you'd like

* Turn on the air conditioning now and stand under the vent for a second for the psychological benefit.  It will always be a good feeling and worth it.
* Fight it for as long as possible.  Get naked

Whichever of these you do will also depend on if you have roommates or family who may not want to see you going to such extremes.  Eventually you will turn the air conditioning on.  **Don't set your thermostat lower than your preferred temperature.**  It won't work to cool the house any faster.  Now, but you're a real champion if you go for 80F or 82F.

By this point in the day it's evening, salad, or the like.  Use your microwave to cook instead of the oven if you must.  Drink a glass of ice water.  Avoid cooking huge roasts or boiling things, for these will add a lot of heat and humidity to your place.  Keep those blinds and curtains shut.

Eventually at night the temperature outside will get lower than your preferred temperature.  Take advantage of this:  turn your air conditioner off and open up those windows.  Try to open up windows opposite from each other so you can catch a breeze, damp air.  You're permitted to use a fan to try to assist the breeze.  Drink a glass of ice water.

Save all your heat-generating activities, taking hot showers, for the night.  When you are finally ready to go to bed, leave those windows open, and sleep as close to naked as you can.  Again a fan next to your bed at night can do wonders for how good your sleep feels.  Drink a glass of ice water before bed.

If you live in most of the US it will get to the point where the nightly low is only as low as 75F or even higher.  As long as it's 78F or lower go ahead and at least try to get a breeze through your house.  If it never goes below your preference temperature

Using all these techniques last summer kept our electric bill at about half the cost of friends with similar apartments.  I'll end the post with some caveats about all of this.

* If you have an indoor pet don't torture it by letting your house heat up every day.  Just take the hit and think of this as part of the cost of pet ownership.
* You may have a temperature-sensitive hobby project like homebrewing or a server rack.  Again you are better off just paying for the air conditioning rather than ruining your project.
* If you begin to notice dampness in the house
* Drink a glass of ice water.
* If you're coming in hot from mowing the lawn, go ahead and just turn down the thermostat.  This is another priority that's just way above saving electricity.

Many of the families I knew purposely earned much less money than they could have so that they remained in the nontax income level. They felt so strongly about not contributing tax money to the government war machine.

  Part of why I practice frugality is because it unplugs me from the corporate pimp chain. I hate big banks so I use the credit union. I do not like how Walmart treats their employees so I don't shop there. I don't like what the Teabaggers/Koch brothers are doing so I don't buy their paper products. BP pissed me off last year so I ride the bus and park my car. Being frugal makes it possible for me to not play their game.

My husband has used the phrase ""I can't pay that"" and saved thousands of dollars. For example:

* $2000 for health care: when he was uninsured and had to go to the emergency room
* $600 on autocare just yesterday. He took his car to an auto repair shop and they said the cost was $1100. He said he couldn't pay that. Then the auto guy said he can do an alternative method and that it would only cost $500.  He said he would talk to his wife first. Then the auto guy made a phone call, so he brought the estimate back to $500.
* $500 (I don't remember exactly) on dental work when he didn't have insurance. When the receptionist said how much it would cost

Bonus stories about my mom bargaining:

* My mom is a shameless bargainer and money saver and I mean SHAMELESS. When I played the flute in middle school, shameless. I could never do that.
* My mom is Korean
* My mom also attempted to bargain with a police officer over parking illegally. It didn't go over well

Edit:
You know what

 My mom came from a poor background in a 3-rd world country. Bargaining is the norm there and not frowned upon unlike the United States. I gave the most extreme examples of her trying to save money. 

I feel like some of you have never been poor and actually just choose to be frugal. Poor people don't have a choice.
My husband was technically in poverty and was part of the working poor for most of his youth. And I worked with inner-city youth

Edit 2:
Many of you assume the hospital/auto repair shop/ dentist were being ""generous"" and being ""conned"" by my husband and not the other way around. The hospital offered financial aid to my husband after he truthfully discussed his financial situation. He also got coil springs instead of air suspension bags, but it could save a person from being burdened by overwhelming debt. Discussing payment plans and discounts are usually not considered because everyone assumes that there's no room to negotiate. I think it's telling that many jumped to the conclusion that poor people are gaming the system instead of the other way around, and that a car shop was being ""generous.""

We work in industrial sales so very tough on our clothes

**TLDR**Every week I save the following on cleaner costs ($25-50 suits depending on staining

It is a work in progress

**Clothing Selection:**

* For daily wear you will need 2-3 dark color wool suits at minimum

* For shirts:White is best for Frugality - It can be bleached if needed, Ordering Online and when the big sales are on, the best shirt for the money (again Canada) is at the Hudson Bay, their Hudson Room (store brand) the egyptian cotton shirt goes on-sale a few times a year and you can picked them up for under $40, outperforms the $200 designer shirts any day of the week. I love some of the new blends compared to some poor quality cotton, most blends will press easier, resist staining and are cheaper.

* Ties: Dark is Best - Smooth is best

**Maintenance:**
 
* I only dry clean my suits every 6 months

* Every day when you take off your suit, it will allow for any creases to fall out on their own. Invest in a good umbrella and overcoat, keep your suit dry, you will not get the puckering at the seams.

* Depending on the season

*Pressing on the Cheap* - If your trousers are losing their crisp press do this: find a good steam iron

* Align your trousers so that when you press your crease is where you want it and drape the two legs of the trousers perpendicular to the ironing board. (You will work in short sections

* Shirts: Nothing too new hear, or dry and hang immediately. When pressing, take one side of the shirt and drape it over the ironing board so that the buttons are on one edge and the other half of the shirt is hanging over. We are going to press front and back together. (I keep things aligned by pinching right under the armpit and at the base of the shirt then drape). Before using the iron quickly flatten out any wrinkles that will form on the back of the shirt. Press with steam and go. Same approach for the sleeves, Finish the collar and you are in business. I can do 10 shirts in around 20 minutes.

**EDIT for Clarification: I basically Iron my shirt in 5 parts: a) Collar b) left half of shirt (front and back at the same time) c) right half of shirt d) left sleeve e) right sleeve. The big difference from how I see most people iron is that I do front and back at the same time to save time.**

**EDIT2: [Video of ironing shirt in under 1:30 on Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7PP2MbrofU)**

* Ties: Fold or hang immediately after it comes off your neck. Cost analysis for me says I wear them until they are stained and then give to charity. Cost for me to get them dry cleaned local is around the same as a new tie. I heard Dryel works well

I will dedicate 20 minutes a week to my clothes

**Edit**
I really did not expect that much interest in my little post.  I was just trying to say thank you for the tips I picked up along the way.  I am going to try to answer a few of the questions that keep popping up.  

First off, rent.  It was horrible housing that has since been torn down.  As we moved up the ladder, pay went up, spending went up, and our credit rating went up.  So we spent more, and the pay went up.... you see how this goes.   

When the time came to move our family past the military, average income, cost of living.  Having both lived in the northern US at one point we knew to cross that off the list right away.  We decided to move back to our favorite post in the southern US.  

Tips that helped the most:
1.  Ditch the dryer and use a clothes line.  
2.  Turn the heater down and put on more clothes.
3.  A phone is meant for making calls
4.  Only a handful of people have my cell number.  Call me at home.  Unlimited talk is a waste of money.
5.  An Iwhat?  No thanks.
6.  Windows what?  No thanks.  
7.  Cut the cord.  I don't like watching QVC anyways.  Locals are HD over the air.  If you wait 24 hrs you can watch everything else for free.  
                   note.... we do like our NFL.  That was my xmas gift from my husband.  A VPN and a subscription  NFL Gamepass.
8.  Turn off lights.  Unplug items when not in use.  
9.  Hey kid
10.  Take what you want but eat what you take.

Working out a Budget (my way)
1.  Take a really hard look at where your money is going every month.  Be honest with yourself.
2.  Round down for what you have and round up for what you owe on each budget you make.  This leaves room for fluctuation.
3.  Every new check means a new budget.  Examine where the money went again.  Can you cut any of those costs?
4.  Stagger your bills so that they don't all come in at the same time.  Try to split the average monthly revolving cost evenly between checks.
5.  Not due until the first
6.  More pay means more to save
7.  Set goals.  When goal is reached
8.  There is no I in team.  Your spouse and children are in this with you.  It only takes one person to throw a budget out of line and miss a goal.  
9.  Give yourself an allowance for the ""little things.""  Take that money out in cash for each period.  When it is gone you are SOL.
10.  Balance your checkbook.  If you bounce a check then you did something wrong.  Fix yourself and don't do it again.  Bounced check fees are a waste of money.  Overdraft fees are a waste of money.


I have some things to get done but I will try to answer more of the questions individually a little later.

So here's our situation : We bought a (somewhat cheap) condo this year since rent is quite pricey in our area and we decided that if we could afford being owners it would be a better idea in the long term. It's being built right now and we plan on moving in either in December or January. 

I have been using Mint.com to track my expenses and do a budget for about 2 years and it have helped me a ton to get better at managing my money. I've started reading blogs (like Mr Money Mustache) and I want to retire early and live without spending like crazy (like I used to do).

The thing is, she doesn't tackle the credit card debt problem and it's usually just fluctuating a lot, she can't get her card down to 0 before making another big purchase.

Since we're a few months away from moving into our new condo, a 2000$ couch and a 1500$ bed frame just to name a few.

Don't put mixed-priced things in one bag. The main offenders are sweet peppers - if green peppers are $0.99/lb

If things are lying on those slanty flat surfaces (lettuce for example)

Get to know the produce guy. If he likes you, go to the back room and cut you off the grapes from the newest shipment.

Don't buy shit out of season. It's more expensive

If you're buying light stuff (chili peppers, this is a much better strategy for saving money without compromising quality.

Bring your own bags. This should be obvious.

Buy onions in the biggest quantities you can eat before they go bad. If you're buying onions once a week, and unlike most other fruits/vegetables you're saving a ton of money when you buy them in bulk. A 10lb bag of onions is $5.99, while a 5lb is $3.99. 

Similarly

Stop buying shit out of season

Feel free to look through those little pre-packaged plastic containers of berries and pick out the ones that are bad. Replace them with fresh berries from surrounding containers. Nobody's going to stop you.

Start underestimating how much a pound really is. At $5.99/lb

Bananas are the cheapest fruits. One banana costs

Try to buy baskets of stuff instead of paying for each one separately. One kiwi is $0.33, profit.

Don't buy asparagus unless they're displayed in water basins. The bottoms of asparagus should be submerged in water, will smell either way. 

Baby carrots are overpriced. All they are are cut up, peel and cut them up yourself.

So the problem I'm having is this: We've been living in a rented apartment for the past 6 years. We don't worry about house maintenance

So if you own a home, which we worked so hard to get where it is. I want a cushion in case something goes wrong, which I'm sure it will, but I still feel that just hemorrhaging money at things we'll need is not the way to go.

Any insight on how to keep staying frugal for a BRAND NEW homeowner?


Edit: Thanks for the suggestions everyone. Here's what I am taking away from this:

-Buy quality tools

-One project at a time. Don't start 40 different things because they will never get done. 

-Property walk throughs at set intervals to determine maintenance needs. 

-Lists

-YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING AT ONCE

-BREATHE

-CALM DOWN IT WILL BE OKAY

Second off: mobile post


Since I stumbled upon r/frugal, with my boyfriend. We liked the area, and the price was right. As well as we were taking over the lease for his elderly father so it worked out well. 


We bought a couch with our tax return instead of paying off my visa. Mistake mistake. But... We do love the couch and have since smartened up. 


We both work minimum wage, but a quick YouTube video taught my boyfriend. 

Toilet paper and frozen fruit are also dirt cheap here. Fresh produce isn't worth it unless you have a mormon sized family. The muffins freeze well


Then I realize the apartment needed a good clean. You guys suggested vinegar and bleach (not together!). Well damn. Clean apartment for pennies :) 


I then started getting in the frugal mood. Finding ways to cut out dollars at a time. Laundry was our big change eater. $1.75 for a wash and $1.75x2 for a dry (the dryer is half the size and needs two runs). 
So I bought a drying rack. $10 and has saved us that within two weeks. 

I cut out paper towel
Problem solved: bucket of 50/50 bleach/water under the sink. Cloths goes in there, and dried. No machines! No bacteria!


I started unplugging everything we didn't need plugged in 24/7. Unsure how much it saves. But it makes us think twice before using the microwave. I don't think I've used it in months. So that's a bonus. 


Cut the cord! No more Bell Aliant! Bought a desktop on sale and hooked it up to our living room tv. We stream, more free time as no commercials and more gaming power! WoW runs ultra smooth. 
$800 desktop found it on sale, sold laptops for $300, Xbox for $150. And no more Bell. Good choice. Also no more commercials means no more in your face product pressure.


We got a kitten. Called around and found the cheapest vet, they pay for food and litter, and this way we didn't have to buy a second cat as a companion for our terribly hyper kitten. Win win. 
Since we started fostering she has calmed down


Next up was to issue the flow of money. We were poor every week after paycheck and couldn't figure out why. I built a spreadsheet and now we have $500 a month to pay off debt. Meaning come the new year


I was paying $260 a month in cabs, 5 years insurance and with a reputable company. While its a newer car and not as frugal as can be, it's amazing on gas ($60 a month - even cheaper than 1 of our bus passes) and we can keep it for a long time (room for baby seats...). It's a Nissan Versa 2011. 


I'm so grateful r/frugal. You have truly changed our lifestyles


Now I make snacks that fit it a 1 cup mason jar. Jello, yogurt and fruit. Muffins in jars. Cookies. Whatever. It's easy for him to grab and it lasts in his bag all day (works security).


Edit: remembering some more tips as the week goes by. 

For me I have more time than money. And therefore I try to use that extra time to save money. I try not to be lazy. If I'm at the grocery store and I want a snack

I've learned how to make pudding and bread (no machine), homemade pasta sauce, pizza sauce, pizza dough I freeze (I make it, stretch it, freeze it, instant frozen pizza!) waffles that I freeze, cat toys
Seriously: invest in a Kitchen Aid. 


Today I'm going to try and make my own potato chips.

Honestly I just feel kind of ashamed to have to resort to this but I can't figure out other options. I'm a white female with a degree who comes from a family of educated middle class people.

This is slight misnomer

This doesn't leave much time to plan if you intend to get on board in January

January was the perfect month for us (two adults), and the fact it's really, really cold outside and will help keep us indoors on weekends.

The rules I'll be using (cobbled together from a few blogs as a guideline) are this:

* The Budget for No Spend Month does NOT include: Usual monthly bills or emergencies. 
It DOES include: any 'entertainment' (eating out, soft drinks at the gas station, coffeeshop drinks, liquor/beer - anything that is not essential to existence basically), all grocery expenses and all gasoline. We've set ours at $300 for the month - our current monthly average of grocery and toiletry budget and very little extra. 

* Not attempting to beat the system by eating ramen or cheap junk food the whole month. We want as many filling

* Many blogs eschew 'stocking up' in advance - I admit I put $50 extra in grocery spending last week to assure we are well prepared with meats, as well as some spices we were running low on. We aren't giving ourselves the luxury of saying 'there's nothing here to eat, let's go out' and giving ourselves variety in our diet. I'm using this as an excuse to STICK to weekly meal planning, since I've been pretty lax on it this year - leading to seriously unnecessary impulse buys in the food department.

* Our chosen ways to use our free time: We will be taking full advantage of my yard sale boardgames collection and my Steam library. We'll exploit /r/BestOfStreamingVideo and its ilk. We'll invite friends over to our house for light but good meals and boardgames as well. I'm going to attempt improving my homemade bread making skills and pouring over my massive cookbook collection for new recipes. My SO will be crocheting and putting more time toward studying for college. No excuses to miss our daily workout routines.

* Start off with all ESSENTIAL daily drivers and other vehicles on a full tank of gas.

* Most blogs in encourage you to crack down on your spending the MOST in the first week

I'll admit,  since we hope to purchase a new gaming computer for Christmas next year. Depending on the success of this month, we might have a couple more in 2013.

I am trying to avoid common missteps that one does while buying a home (first time). A few of them I know are as follows.

1. Not to buy a home on a busy street/corner.
2. Look for the lay of the land for for possible water accumulation during rains. 
3. Hardwood is easier to keep clean vs carpet.
4. Orientation of the home for better efficiency.

I make 12k a year from working 20 hours a week at $11.50 an hour. I also get $470/month from DCFS because I got taken from my parents and I'm in college

My boyfriend pays half of our rent/utilities/food/pet care. So

Our food budget is $200/month. We get by with this very easily. We only shop at local grocery stores

Our rent is $780/month for a one bedroom

I pay $80 in gas every month

Every pay check I put 3% in my 401k and 20% in savings. I've built up a good little chunk there by tossing any extra bits of cash I have into savings

How I save money?

I feel like we get by a lot easier than most mostly because of two things.

1. Our grocery budget is low because we know how to cook and don't have expensive tastes.

2. We're massive nerds that get anxiety from going out too much. There are so many free hobbies to have

- calculate what percentage of that income is used just for living, groceries, insurance
- whatever you have left is the money you can choose to spend however you want

It's not much, next time you think about buying something non-essential, convert it into how long you would have to work for the *spending money*

Here's an example:

Say I earn **3000** after-tax income per month. 
Daily income is approximately **$143** (3000 / 21 work days)
Hourly income is **$17.80**

Some approaches to spending stop here and say if you're going to spend money, not spending money. 

I earn 3000 but of that, pet food, nappies, fuel.. etc. And about **$700** is for savings, and fun &amp; disposable spending. $700 is about 24% of $3000. 

The final step is to find 24% of my hourly rate of $17.80 = **$4.20  per hour**

So say I want to go out with friends this weekend and budget $100 for drinking, having a few drinks at home first seems like a great idea, and limiting the ones we have out and about. Not to mention sharing cabs etc. Maybe we can bring it down to a $50 evening and I've just saved 10 hours of work in terms of my spending money. 

**TL;DR - Think about spending in terms of work hours instead of money

I've worked at Starbucks a long time now

Brewed coffee is cheap enough. Ask for a pour over of their bold coffee for a fresher cup. It takes a few minuets, ask for a French Press. It's around 4 dollars and is approximately 45 oz of fresh, hot, French pressed coffee. *And* you can pick whichever blend you'd like. 

If you want espresso, don't ask for one. Ask for a ""grande Americano in a tall cup"". That way, they charge you an extra 30 cents, instead of an extra 70 cents for the shot of espresso. This works because Grande Americanos get three shots. Same would work for a Venti. My manager tells all his partners to do this by default, whether the customer asks for it that way or not, but other stores may not be so nice. 

If you like iced drinks, there's no real way to do this with hot lattes, as you need a barista to steam the milk for you. 

If you and a friend are out and want a Frappuccino, 4. 

If you are secretly a Starbucks junkie, and pay with your card each time, reloading it as you go. You get a free drink (Any kind of drink, not matter how expensive) every 10 transactions or so. You get a free tall coffee with each purchase of a 1lb of coffee and a free tall drink of your choice for each 2lbs. You also get a free drink on your birthday. If you have one of these, and are getting drinks for multiple people, ring up each drink separately. 

Also, water soluble coffee. No chemicals, no freeze drying. Actually quite good. I've used it when I'm staying in a hotel and it tastes just like coffee (Get the bold Italian Roast though, not the Colombian). A 12 pack of that stuff is $9.95. Not bad price per cup. And it dissolves in hot or cold water and even milk (.98 cent latte anyone?). It's a good gift for someone who works in an office with bad coffee or travels a lot. It's also wonderful in cooking. Act very skeptical and ask a lot of questions about it. If you don't get offered a free drink or some other deal with it within 2 minuets, I'd be very surprised. 

Also, the ring code works for any size. In addition to that, if you want a more expensive drink, we can take the price of a tall coffee off for you from the original price. Also, talk about how you're now out of coffee. The barista will most likely offer you a pound of our coffee for the same price as the grocery store coffee (The grocery store coffee is a smaller bag and is around 7 dollars, the bags in retail stores are 1lb and cost about 9 or 10). They can also grind it custom for you. As a side note, you can get any of our coffees weighed out. You can buy a full 1lb

Also, Starbucks baristas get a weekly coffee/tea/VIA markout. My boyfriend's parents and my parents never have to buy coffee because I get it for free. Furthermore, we get partner shopping days around the holidays, 40% off everything. Starbucks is a great place to get presents for those people you don't know very well (distant co-workers, secret santas, teachers, etc) and you can save a lot of money by asking a barista you know to buy it for you. 

Also

Let me just say, but most of it. We make our own whipped cream, the Frappuccinos are hand made with real coffee and milk, teas are full leaf, the mocha is made fresh everyday and the Chai concentrate is all natural. You can get whatever drink you can possibly think of. Our pasteries are now made without HFCS, artificial colors, or preservatives. Our coffees are sourced ethically (Bucks pays a higher price for raw coffee than say, and, part time or full, savings plans

A good way to tell if a store is good or not is through two ways:

* Drive Thrus. Many drive thru stores are not as good as a cafe-only store. But say that a drive-thru store also has...

* Newer espresso machines. The older ones have the separate hoppers for the decaf and espresso beans and have two metal steam wands. The newer ones have a retro look to them, the espresso is better from these machines, as the shots are timed with each pour, so the barista can better maintain the quality of the pour. The old machines had to be timed and calibrated every four hours or so, and, a lot of times, that just doesn't get done.

* However, will have a fourth one going down the drain, unless you ask the barista nicely if they could throw it in for you. Sometimes, if you're friendly from the get go, the barista will just do it anyways. And viola! Free shot.  

ALSO. Not that I would believe any of you to be guilty of this, complimenting the barista on bar on the quality of your drink will pretty much be the highlight of their day. I can say from experience, a man once said to me ""You're so smart [sip] and you make a damn good cappuccino,"" the cappuccino part was the one that stayed with me. 

Hope this helps you save a bit! Happy coffee drinking!

EDIT: 
Finally, or just go with a pour over. The red light starts blinking after an hour. At my store, we're pretty strict about the 30 minute time limit on our coffees, but other stores aren't.

**What kind of dryer should you buy?**

Whirlpool-made electric or gas dryers

**1. Initial Cost.** They are close to

**2. Ongoing Costs.** They require the least amount of maintenance. All dryers are going to need maintenance in proportion to their use, I believe because of superior design factors.

**3. Repair Costs.** They are the cheapest and easiest to repair. The cost of a replacement part runs from just under $2 to about $30. The average price to repair a Whirlpool dryer is less than $10. I’ve repaired hundreds of them. All of the repairs can be done within 15-30 minutes by someone reasonably handy. There are videos on YouTube that walk you through every repair.

Whirlpool
Roper

Inglis
Kirkland
Kitchen Aid
Whirlpool now owns Maytag and Amana as well

**Why you shouldn’t buy other brands?**

Because most of them are junk. They weren’t designed very well and they break down quicker. When they break down

**Should you purchase a gas or electric dryer?**

Right now natural gas is really cheap and if you already have a gas setup in your house, primarily because of less demand.

**How much should you pay for a used dryer?**

Expect to pay $50 to $150 for a used dryer. Dryer power cords can cost $20-$30

**What to watch out for when buying a used dryer**

If you hear a whiny, unless you repair appliances for a living. (even then, most repair places don’t swap motors out).

Don’t buy a dryer if the timer isn’t advancing. Timers

It’s better to be able to see the dryer working before you purchase, it shows that the previous owner was still able to use it themselves.

**What if you can’t test the dryer out?**

Take close notice of the person you are potentially buying from. Do they seem like they took care of it? Why are they selling it? Ask them if there are any issues with it at all and let them talk. In the end

**Should you buy a dryer with a digital display?**

Short answer, they are very expensive to repair.

**Frequently Asked Questions (will update)**

**Where is the best place to buy dryer parts?**

If you can wait a few days

**What about preventative maintenance?**

Clean your lint trap before each use. I recommend taking the back panel off your dryer every few years and vacuuming the lint, after turning your dryer on, go check where the air exits the house and make sure the airflow is good and that there isn’t lint buildup at the exit. I’ve seen the exits completely clogged so that no air was able to escape. This will always cause destruction on the dryer as the dryer will overheat if the air is not able to vent properly.

**What kind of vent ducting is best?**

Solid ducting is better than the coiled ducting as it doesn’t clog up nearly as easily. Keep the distance for the air to make it outside as short as possible. The further the distance

**Where should the exhaust tubing exit the house?**

The key here is that the air exits the house. Never exhaust a dryer inside a house as the moisture will only increase the chances of mold. Always vent out the side of the house if possible. Under the house only as a last resort

**How many kinds of dryer power cords are there?**

Four. Two different kinds of three prong


**What kind of power does a gas/electric dryer use?**

Gas dryers use 110 volt

Electric dryers use 220 volt (except for the very rare

**What about the really old Kenmore dryers?**

Don’t buy the model that only has one button. I think they are about 25-30 years old. Anyway

The old brown/black panel Kenmore dryers are incredible. They were overbuilt

**How long should you expect a dryer to last before it will need repairs?**

This is impossible to answer. There are too many variables, how well the washing machine is getting water out etc. Then, there is no odometer to know how many loads have been done prior to you getting the dryer. Learn how to do some basic repairs, and expect maintenance to be occasionally needed.

**Is it worth it to pay for a warranty?**

I don’t think so. Most guys that offer a warranty on Craigslist only offer one for 30 days etc

**How to transport a dryer?**

Dryers weigh about 100 lbs and can be transported upright or on their side. Try not to slide them across concrete or pavement too much as it will just bend the little plastic feet. Also,,False,,t5_2qhbe,1362449111.0,,True

1. Bring your own reusable water bottle. Make sure it's empty when you go through security, even have ""water bottle refilling"" water fountains, specific for water bottles.

I never worked in my life - I quit school and my father was disabled until he died earlier this year, I am 20 years old right now.

I am currently staying with someone for free - I have no credit. What is the cheapest option for going to school? $15, but through a divorce he had no money left, he couldn't help me, and I was in no real position to work. Now I can basically do whatever I want. 

My ultimate goal would be to end up in medical school. 

I already live an extremely minimal life:
* I spend no more than $35 for groceries per week
* I don't eat out
* I don't use soaps or cosmetics
* walk everywhere or take public transit
* everything I own fits in a backpack and a suitcase
* I hand wash all my clothes in cold water I save in a bucket while I wait for water to get warmer for a shower - then I air dry
* I spend virtually nothing on entertainment


I'm thinking I can actually live on $10, and reduce the costs as much as possible. I would rather work less and have more time for myself to think and study. The thing is, I am not entirely sure what to study. The first two years are mostly general classes, correct?

I am currently in Germany with my girlfriend (I am not in the military, or bad lifestyle. My family are all fundamentalist Christians while I am an atheist, it doesn't go well. They also support an unhealthy lifestyle. What are the average costs of something like a small studio apartment? I don't need anything really, but internet is a must (I think most places have wi-fi now, though). 

What is possibly the best state, but I do not want to go back to that sort of weather, cost of living, or people. In parts of upstate NY it is like the deep south. I cannot deal well with the low sunlight and snow in the winter, it aggravates my depression.



My options
Go back to the USA for 3 months
Go back to the USA and study for 2 years
Go back to USA permanently and study

Germany seems to be more stable than America right now - I could get a bachelors degree here for $2

1350923181.0,11wgsr,Frugal Tip for Sushi Lovers: Make your own!,thiskillstheredditor,618,195,222,"I enjoy spending my money efficiently (aka not getting ripped off)

That all changed when I watched an [episode of Good Eats](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRdTq93XcVg) where Alton Brown shows mere mortals how to make sushi. Alton shows that sushi is actually fairly easy to make, if we included a bottle of wine it would easily be $100 (plus tip). So a 90% savings!

The key to getting a low cost per roll is to be committed. I buy my ingredients somewhat in bulk from WalMart and Amazon

What you'll need:

* Short-grained sushi rice. I bought 20lbs of mine for $17 at Walmart
* Nori (seaweed). Packs of 20 pre-cut sheets available at Walmart for $2.
* Rice Vinegar. Bottle is about $3 at local supermarket.
* Powdered Wasabi. Buy online for about $10/lb
* Sriracha. You should own this anyway
* Japanese mayo. Big bottle on Amazon for $10. It goes bad in about a month so I dumped half of the bottle into a vacuum-sealed bag and put in the coldest part of my fridge. The other half I combined in a half-full Sriracha bottle with a squeeze of lemon- voila
* Rolling mat. I happened to have bamboo placemats that worked better than the ""official"" mat
* Soy sauce. Don't get generic here- go for Kikkoman or another name brand. $5 for the big bottle at Walmart.
* Sesame seeds. Packets of these are 80 cents in the hispanic food section of walmart


So you're probably asking how this is frugal- I just listed $50 of ingredients and we haven't even gotten to the fish or veggies. The thing is

Ingredients for an 8-roll meal:

* 2 cups rice ($0.85)
* 8 pieces of nori ($0.80)
* 2 Tbsp Rice Vinegar ($0.25)
* 2 Tbsp sugar ($0.01)
* 1 Tbsp salt ($0.001)
* 3 Tbsp Wasabi Powder ($0.10)
* 8oz Sushi-grade Yellowfin Tuna ($4)
* 4oz Wild-Caught King Salmon ($3)
* 1/2 avocado ($0.50)
* 1/4 mango ($0.25)
* 1/2 cucumber ($0.25)
* Bottle of wine from Trader Joe's ($5)
* Cream cheese, pineapple.. any ingredient you want to throw in can be used in very small quantities and cost next to nothing.

The prep time is admittedly somewhat long- about 45 minutes. That said, especially for people who have never done it.


EDIT- As notpandora pointed out- this is not something to ""get milage"" out of. Buy the fish you are going to use for that meal the same day

Additionally, it would lose me a $100 incentive they give to account holders who have Direct Deposit. She said the letter from BOA wouldn't matter one bit. 

The minute I left the CU, and I could go on their normal checking account. This saved me at LEAST $220, and a lot of hassle and inconvenience.

All of these added up could have been very expensive. So check your bills,False,,t5_2qhbe,1341171899.0,,,t3_vw0ay

I can buy lunch in the break room

I've tried just doing a peanut butter sandwich and a banana, I'm crazy hungry by the time I get off work and if it's a long day I just can't make it through on only that. Also, after about 3 or 4 days of having this for lunch, I start going a little crazy.

I've also tried bringing a homemade version of lunchables, and blocks of cheese were on sale 2 for $6, so I made 6 lunches with about 20 slices (approx. 1.25 oz) of pepperoni, 20 slices (approx. 2.5 oz) of cheese, and 20 crackers, plus a banana, all of which cost me a little over $2 per lunch) This option seems a little better in terms of keeping me full through lunch, but it's still not a great option.

I'll probably stick with bringing a banana every day since I can consistently get them for about $0.69 per pound and the potassium helps keep my legs/feet from cramping up while I'm working, and cost under $5 per meal (I would really like to keep it under $3, but I know that might not always be possible given my needs.) 

Some other info: 

Our lockers are outside and as far as I know we don't have access to a refrigerator or microwave

I don't need to worry about bringing a drink

**tl;dr** I need advice for what lunches I can pack cheaply for work that will keep me full

**UPDATE** Thanks for all the great tips! I went to the farmers market this morning and loaded up on great local ingredients, bought some local eggs that I'm boiling, and got enough ingredients to make granola for months (oats, peanuts, and raisins were on sale so I stocked up on enough for probably at least 4 big batches)

Yep

Edit: My cost was $54.00 after my insurance company paid $14.00 of it. Since the doctor was part of the insurance network of providers, and told me that I couldn't possibly duplicate it with OTC medicine. I explained to him how I procured the *exact* same ingredients, he told me that not everyone can do that. So much for your helpful, caring, friendly pharmacist that is just looking out for your well-being. 

**update:**

Just had the procedure and it was a breeze. The staff at the clinic were *very* interested in how I put my own kit together

**edit**

The staff at the clinic asked for my ""recipe."" Here's what I sent them:

Halflitely contains:

210g polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG 3350)

1 bisacodyl tablet 5mg

2.86g sodium bicabonate

5.6g sodium chloride

.74g potassium chloride

artificially sweetened flavor packet


My preparation: ( I converted the grams to teaspoons

1 bottle (238g) PEG 3350. This can be found under various brand names, etc. should have house brands. (I bought Walgreens brand Smooth Lax.) 


1-5mg enteric coated Bisacodyl tablet I bought Walgreens Gentle Laxative Tablets, etc.

Electrolytes:

1/4 tsp (1.5 g) Morton Lite Salt (contains 50% sodium chloride and 50% potassium chloride

1/2 tsp (slightly rounded) (3g) sodium bicarbonate (baking soda)

1tsp (5g) salt.

(This closely approximates the electrolytes found in Halflytely. precision is not at all critical here)

Place PEG 3350 and electrolytes in 2 liter soda bottle. fill halfway and shake well

Use the same instructions as with Halflytely.



I sincerely hope you can use this!

Your staff at the clinic is great

Take care

**Edit:**
Damn, and I appreciate all of your input on this subject.

One nice thing about my procedure was that afterward they smiled and congratulated me every time I ripped a huge fart. It seems that copious farting is a really good sign when you are in recovery. I have never experienced such enthusiastic approval for flatulence before!

They sent me home with three photos: 1. A picture of a diverticulum

**edit.**

The lead nurse at the GI clinic just sent me this: **Thank you for passing this along.  We have several patients that just can not afford the halflytley prep.  Until Medicare begins to pick up the tab

A few places ago I noticed that the the apartment fridge was almost always running

Being the avid do-it-yourselfer I pulled the fridge away from the wall and got out the vacuum cleaner

I determined that the compressor coils are underneath the fridge

So I started the project by buying a dryer vent cleaning brush at Target as it fits well under the fridge and began to scrape it back and forth over the coils both from the front and from behind the fridge

I pulled out piles of gunk.  Reams.  Little piles of dry offal that caked the coils I figure contribute mightily to reducing the efficiency of the fridge, then scrubbing it with a scotch pad.

Net result is that the fridge is on much less than it used to be and it runs much more quietly.  I figure this saves me enough money to pay for the brush

A special thanks to /u/eagleabel33 for this useful tool: https://www.google.com/advisor/

- Find a decent ""rewards"" card

- In a nutshell

- Now, or anything that you'd use your CASH on. A credit card should NEVER be used as a ""loan"" to buy something you can't afford RIGHT NOW.

- When you get your bill at the end of the month

- This is NO DIFFERENT than using cash. If I would have paid for my tank of gas with a $20 bill, only I'll get some change back via rewards.

- As you use the card, in other words.

- Edit: A few more pros I overlooked thanks to some comments here: Security. Using your credit card online is WAY safer than using a debit card. If your credit card numbers get compromised it's really not that big of a deal

Credit card companies are not evil, everything you buy with a credit card more or less has a 30 day free guarantee on it. Say you bought something with the credit card and it's defective or broken, and the company won't accept a return. Well, write a letter to your credit card company disputing that purchase, requesting they remove the charge. Bam.

1371856702.0,1gtr34,Having Kids? Some Frugal Tips for the Early Years,tressea,506,111,159,"We're on Baby #2 and here's what we've learned


FOOD &amp; SHELTER:

* Breastfeed: Breastfeeding saves,800 per year.  It's the cheapest, healthiest, highest benefit/cost ratio thing you will ever do.

* Puree Your Own Food: Once your baby hits the solid food stage (which actually shouldn't be until 6 months... people start solid food way too early and it's not medically advised), stick them in a food processor or blender, and freeze in ice cube trays.  It's healthier and WAY cheaper than buying baby food and you DON'T need to that crazy expensive Beabo thing they sell everywhere.  If you really want to save, get a few people together, have everyone choose a different fruit or vegetable, puree, freeze

* Buy a crib that transitions into a normal bed.  They're more expensive

CLOTHING:

* Don't buy any newborn clothes.  Seriously.  Your kid will be in them for 2 or 3 weeks tops

* Refuse to buy full-price baby clothes.  Find your nearest outlet mall with a Carter's or OshKosh outlet, Marshalls, and consignments are good bets, too.

* Dresses are expensive and a pain in the neck for pre-walkers.  They are SO cute in the store, and they're generally just a pain.  I can't tell you how many dresses we've bought that our daughter has NEVER worn.  

* Same thing with collared shirts and overalls for boys under the age of 1.  

* Onesies and pants are the way to go for BOTH girls and boys before they start walking. Cheap

* Invest in a case of OxyClean gel.  It's the best stain-treater for kids' clothes out there.

* Cloth diapers are cheaper than disposables although there's a large cost at the outset to buy the supplies.  There's also some debate over whether the amount of water used to clean them and the wear and tear on your washer and dry are worth it.  I won't jump into that debate.  I will say that if you use disposable diapers

Toys:

* The BEST toys are not toys at all.  We learned that with our first. The most entertaining, egg cartons &amp; a bag full of buttons, junk mail, sponges, scraps of fabric, a box full of dried beans with a shovel and some cups in it, etc. etc.  Start thinking outside of the box (or ABOUT the box) and you'll discover a world full of amazing stuff that your kids will love.  We stock up on random things at the Dollar Store and think open-endedly about our household items and our kids are SET.  There are a ton of great kids play blogs that can get the ball rolling for you (no pun intended).

* Our general rule is not to by any ""real"" toys unless we're convinced our kids will play with them for at least 5 years.  So, sports equipment (balls, basketball hoops, etc.), blocks, puzzles, etc. are fair game.  Anything made by Baby Einstein and most things made by Fisher Price are not (although Fisher Price does have some cool long-term toys).

* Beyond that, pom poms, pipe cleaners, construction paper, etc. are inexpensive and worthwhile.  Get them at the Dollar Store or on discountschoolsupply.com.

* IKEA has FABULOUS, but I'm consistently impressed with their selection.  Their cheap kitchen/storage container/misc. sections are great sources of potential playthings, too.

* I mentioned this site above, and good sales.

ACTIVITIES

* There are approximately one hundred million enrichment classes your child can take from birth.  Most of them charge obscene amounts of money.  Don't get sucked in.

* Your local library almost certainly has a free story time for kids.

* Local museums have free classes and activities.

* A lot of children's classes will let you have one free one to scope them out.  They're nice to try on a rainy day.

* Get a group of parents and kids together and have a sing-along.  Or set up an obstacle course.  Or blow bubbles together.  You're doing pretty much EXACTLY what they're doing in the pricey classes.  

SPECIAL TREATS

* There's a tendency to think that ""special treats"" for kids have to involve trips to Disney World or elaborate vacations but we've found that (a) those big trips can be stressful and bewildering to our kids and (b) there are super cheap things that we can do at home that are just as magical and appreciated by them.

* The Dollar Store sells five-packs of glow sticks.  Open one or two packs, and toss the glow sticks in the bath with your kids. VOILA! Glow bath.  They'll go crazy and you've only spent $2.  If you want to make them REALLY happy, let them take the glow sticks to bed with them. 

* Get your kids out of bed one night and take them out for ice cream in their pajamas.  My parents did that once and it was pretty much the best and most exciting thing that had happened to me in my life up to that point.  Heck

* Put a cup or two of baking soda on a platter.  Add food coloring to white vinegar and let your kids drop it into the baking soda to make ""color fizzes.""  

* Build an elaborate tent fort with your kids.  

* Really

OTHER TIPS:

* Buy everything in a gender-neutral color or blue.  We buy everything over $25 in green.  Or

* Get the most recent copy of a book called ""Baby Bargains."" It reviews pretty much every category of products on the market and will tell you the best deals to be had.  It's an invaluable resource.

Good luck and happy parenting!

EDIT: Wow! So glad so many people found this helpful.  There are so many other good tips and ideas in the comments section.  A few follow-ups from those:

* Baby-Led Weaning: I think baby-led weaning is great.  You exclusively breastfeed for longer (which is better from a medical perspective: it's associated with lower rates of allergies and asthma), so we wound up unintentionally doing baby-led weaning.  She exclusively nursed until 10 months and then was ready for regular meals one day.  We saved a ton of money as a result.  

* Shoes: I was hesitant to even venture into this topic because people have really strong reactions to it, SHOULDN'T wear shoes until their walking is well established.  Wearing shoes can negatively impact the development of their feet and ""teach"" toddlers to walk the wrong way.  This is straight out of the mouth of my pediatrician who said, ""I don't want shoes on her feet until she's been walking for a while and then find the cheapest, most flexible pair you can.  Barefoot is better.""  We only started putting shoes on our daughter's feet after she had been walking for a couple of months and she needed protection for when she was walking around outside.  When your kid IS ready for shoes, find a Stride Right outlet.  They have great deals and a they're super helpful at helping you select the right kind of shoe for your kid's phase of development.  (Note: If you do decide to wait on shoes, expect a tremendous amount of pushback, particularly from older people who came from a generation when kids wore shoes ALL THE TIME

* Convertible Cribs: There's some debate in the comments over whether it's worthwhile to pay extra for a crib that converts given that you'll have to buy another crib if you have another child rather than reuse the first one.  It's a legitimate point

* Dollar Store Toys: We actually don't buy Dollar Store toys for the reasons discussed below (with the exception of glow sticks): they're virtually all made in China and we worry about the chemicals in the paint.  Also, however, buy a lot of play materials from other sections of the store.  They have flat glass marbles in their floral section, arts and crafts supplies, cups and scoops for our sensory bin, food coloring for crafts, etc. etc.  

* Choking Hazards: You obviously should not give your kids buttons, so, for instance, my daughter could safely play with buttons and marbles from 9 months on.  Our son was different.  

* Toy Swaps/Rotations: Another great thing to do is exchange bags full of toys with friends for a period of time. Often, when our toys come back, they're exciting and fresh again.  

* Great Idea Blogs: I've gotten so many AMAZING, Learn with Play at Home, and In Lieu of Preschool.  There are a ton of great ideas on Pinterest, too. ",,False,,1371922778.0,t3_1gtr34

This hand thing has been an ongoing issue for me through college and my introduction to the professional world so it was great having such a supportive community to lean on with all those issues coming back. 

I spoke to administration and a different IT guy and they said they would get me an alternative mouse if I can figure out one that I need and the other IT guy said he could easily hot-key the tagging system for me. It would create more work for him at the tail end of the production but he's willing to do it. It looks like it might work out after all.

Since most of my worries about this situation stem from my frugality mindset, where the advice might be more like 'chase your dreams.'

I have broken hands. I have horrible scar tissue from a surgery that presses on my tendon and makes my thumb and pointer finger difficult to use. It's healed enough for mild to moderate computer use (a normal office job) but it's completely useless for extended to excessive use.

I have a job at a law firm that pays 30k a year plus overtime and bonuses. It's a pretty shitty job, so I don't want to leave her in July and screw her over.

We got a new project that requires excessive (constant) clicking for 9 hours a day

1. The accounts are not connected ""virtually"" or anything. So I can't easily go online and move 5, it's a whole ordeal.

2. I don't pay bills or have any direct withdrawals out of my savings account. So I don't have to deal with that psychological aspect of seeing my account fluctuate

3. I'm glad I moved to a credit union. I'd recommend it for anyone. But the branch I use doesn't have the best hours and they don't have a drive through or atms out front. Which is PERFECT for savings. I can't quickly withdraw money on the weekend for some dumb impulse buy. I can't pull money out at 2am. I have to consider my major purchases and wait until the bank is open to make a withdraw. 

4. My credit union is not for profit and I've earned more money in interest (not a lot

He laughed at my being poor.  “You’re not poor; you’re broke.” 

“Oh?”

“Not having money doesn’t make you poor.  You are smart, and it’s temporary.  Being poor is lack of options- it’s a state that is not likely to change.”

I thought of this, 2 parents, and some grandparents living in their small house, my father being one of the youngest, and one of the shortest.  My grandfather had caught a deer while hunting, and there was venison on the table.  My aunt describes my dad in the back of the crowd that was gathered around the table jumping up and down “don’t forget me, don’t forget me!”  He was trying to get to the table to get some venison

That is when I noticed my dad wasn’t laughing.  To me, a much more permanent state.

Dad and I had rounded the corners of the isles and found ourselves wandering back towards the produce section.  My dad says to me “Did you know I’m a millionaire?”

Now, I think I would have noticed if my parents were millionaires.

“Oh are you?” I smirk.

“Sure I am.  I’m a Zen Millionaire.”

“A Zen Millionaire?”

“Yeah.... you see I may not be a millionaire everywhere I go.  But, I can buy it.  I don’t have to think ‘can I afford a salad today?’ because I know I can.  I may have to compare prices in every other section of this store.  But, when it comes to the fruits and vegetables, I don’t have to question if I can afford it.  That makes me a Zen Millionaire.”

Since that day I’ve been broke many of times-- on and off, I can afford.  I don’t have to jump or wave my arms or beg to be noticed.... I can afford to buy what is healthiest for me, even if it means sacrificing elsewhere.  And, I’m pretty sure, that makes me a Zen Millionaire too.

My car antenna fell off a while ago, but ended up patching it with duct-tape and leaving it.  A couple years ago, I was in a very minor accident where I bumped into someone. It loosened my front bumber. It wasn't a major deal and I haven't bothered to fix that either.  My car is also pretty dirty and it just feels old.  

In short

Today it got to the point where I actually made a list of the things I hated about my car. I was trying to find a way to justify spending money I didn't have to spend.

Then it occurred to me, antenna, mirror (housing and all), as well as a few cosmetic bits cost me under $150.  I've ordered them and will install them myself when they arrive.

I'm going to clean my car out completely (except for the insurance, wax, and self-detail and my car is practically brand new.

The only other things it really needs are an alignment and a tune-up (both already on my to-do list).  I'm even going to get a quote on fixing the bumber and will do it if it's cheap. I remember being quoted $200 or $250 when I first was in the accident.

In the end

It's not the cheapest. Leaving things as they are would be cheapest. But it's a lot cheaper than allowing myself to make a really costly decision.

Here is a list of my homemade solutions:
All Purpose Cleaner:
3 tsp. Vinegar
1/2 tsp. Washing Soda
1/2 tsp Castile Soap
2 c. Hot Water
Any essential oil for smell. I use scented Castile Soap because I know many oils can be very deathly to cats. Check your house plants too!

Glass Cleaner:
1/4 c Rubbing Alchohol
1/4 c. White Vinegar
1 tbsp. Corn Starch
2 c. Distilled
Distilled makes for no streaks!

""Pledge"" knockoff:
2 tsp. Olive Oil
2 c. Water
1/4 c. White Vinegar
10-15 drops of Citrus

""Febreeze"" knockoff:
1/8 c. Fabric Softener
2 tbs. Baking Soda
Fill the rest with water and add Lavendar

Vinegar and Lavendar Laundry Softener:
1 Quart White Vinegar
25 Drops of Lavendar
1 tsp. Rubbing Alchohol
1/2 c. per load
Also Peppermint is really great for laundry too!!

Dry Laundry Detergent:
1 Box Washing Soda
1 Box Borax
3 Bars Felsnaptha Soap
2 Tubs Oxygenated Bleach
2 c. Baking Soda
Oxygenated Bleach is a derivative of Hydrogen Peroxide. Since it is not edible, I just add essential oils. This batch will last you FOREVER. I mean forever people. You only need 1 tbsp per small wash and 2 for larger. It lasted me almost a whole year.

Grease Cutter:
2c. Water
1/4 c. Castile Soap
10 drops Lavendar

No Grate Laundry Soap: (SO EASY!)
3 tbs. Borax
3 tbs. Washing Soda
2 tbs. Dish Soap (All Natural works well)
20-30 drops of oil.
Put in old laundry detergent bottle and fill the rest of the way with water. 

Room or pillow/sheets spray:
1 tbs. Vodka
10 drops oil
2 c. Water

Bleach Alternative:
12 cups water
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 cup hydrogen peroxide
2 c. Per Load

These are all just recipes and ideas I have found to be very useful. No choking on toxins while trying to clean the bathroom. I feel like we are pretty trained to think bleach and windex and other toxic cleaners are what smell good, but it lasts me years. Years, people!

ALL the buying guides I read said you should always be prepared to walk away from the deal. So, and only came up $300 after their counter, and wouldn't budge after that. That was WAY under what I was prepared to spend, but they accepted $2,000 off sticker. I even said I wouldn't pay the $129 document fee and they knocked THAT off.

It was this that led me down the road of using 'every part of the cow'  in my cooking

As a primer

Ingredients:

* Whole Chicken
* Potatos
* Greens
* Starchy veg like carrots/parsnips/whatever
* Dried noodles or cabbage
* Soy/Fish sauce
* Lime/Ginger powder

Here's what I'd make:

* **Meal one** - Butterfly a chicken (cut the backbone out and flatten it, and add the roast potatos and greens. 

After this orgy of delicious chicken

* Preparation work for meat: divide the chicken into the other breast, wing halves, and 'misc' (where you're scraping every last piece of meat off)
* Preparation work for stock: Pour off the roasting fat and juice into a jug and cool.
* Preparation work for broth: Add chopped celery/carrot/onion/garlic to a big pot and fry them off

Here's what'd be left over to use:

* **Meal two** - Roast chicken with mash: Other breast and potato mash/greens from the previous meal
* **Meal three** Soup: Fry up onion and carrot in a pot, turnip, parsnip, carrot, potato, swede, etc.) and boil. You can blend smooth
* **Meal four** Noodle Stir-fry: Marinade a thigh/drumstick in some 5-spice and oyster sauce
* **Meal Five** Chicken Stir Fry: Repeat above with pre-cooked rice or broccoli/carrot
* **Meal Six** Heat up some beans (ideally dried, cook some rice in the chicken broth and add some sweetcorn and the remainder of the shredded chicken.
* **Meal Seven** Ginger Chicken Soup: Onion


None of this is difficult, but it's extremely cheap and I likely can make use of it and save money in the long run'. I was terrified of the food going to waste, but re-purposing and overlapping meals like this has led to good savings, and I need to buy less (no more buying stock cubes or packs of chicken breasts). 

Obviously not every meal is like this - but I've come to realise less is more in terms of ingredients -'all the trimmings' is rarely a good thing (/r/minimeals is a bridge too far IMO,False,,t5_2qhbe,False,,,t3_z2ncb

Keep records of everything!  Have a master spreadsheet for all tools, how much inventory you have in stock, which pieces are out on consignment and which you have at hand, what people have purchased, etc.  Even keep track of favours, so you have a record of who ""owes you one"" and who you owe favours too.

I bought my house 9 years ago just before my 20th birthday. My fiancée was pregnant with our first child and we decided we no longer wanted to rent. The only place that had most of what we wanted was small-ish (less than 1

We purchased our house with a 30 year loan and a 6.38% interest rate. At the *time* it was a damn good rate considering we had no money down and I'm sure our credit wasn't great as we were so young.

After a few years things got a bit bumpy, especially considering I do not currently have a college education (coming soon, hopefully). I've got one major vice when it comes to spending (feel free to stalk my posts over at /r/dvdcollection) but I don't smoke, drink alcohol or eat fast food very often (I don't even drink coffee)... I mostly hang out with my kids and make crafty stuff, ride bikes, try my hand at photography and watch movies. Spending time with my family has saved me a lot of money and made me a better Dad.

So... I made a goal for myself. Pay off my house by the time I turn 40. It seems impossible. Very little of my mortgage payment was even going towards principal. Last year I looked into refinancing. I shopped around to different lenders and in doing so I apparently caused my credit score to dip a bit. This was upsetting especially after realizing that a refinance wasn't going to help much after closing costs etc. I backed out and tried not to think about it.

Well that has lasted about a year and I decided to try again. To my surprise my credit score is now above 740 (pay your bills on time

After all was said and done I lessened the term of my loan by 6 years, why not pay the bill every two weeks. In doing so, I am essentially overpaying a half a payment every 6 months which adds an extra full months payment to the principal each year.

It's still going to be close, and after that day the only thing I'll need to worry about is taxes and utilities. Can you imagine how much stress that must release? gah... can't wait.

Store brand items are rarely made by 'cheaper' companies in grocery chains.  Usually a large brand will repackage the store brand item so they can get more items and facings in the store and preferential treatment from corporate buyers when selling new items.  The ingredients of the store brand item won't be EXACTLY the same as the name brand BUT it will still have the same level of quality

OK

Lets say I'm having a cookout and need to buy bratwurst but the high quality Johnsonville Brats are 2 dollars more expensive per pack than the store brand and I need to keep prices low but keep the quality of my meats for the BBQ high (so my friends don't think I'm a cheap ass... but the PBR might give that away...).

[Here is a picture of a package of Johnsonville Brats](http://i.imgur.com/phH8p.jpg) Do you see the small circle above ""Previously handled frozen for your protection

Even the biggest names only have handful of places that will package their product and (usually) only one that will handle the grocery chains in your region.  That location will also handle/package the store brand items.  

SO, but it will save you money if you are looking for quality along with low prices.

Fast forward seven months. We moved in together recently into a small, neither of us has the time or energy to cook like good, frugal vegetarians should.

Typical meals for us include:

**Breakfast**:
* Quaker instant oatmeal
* Sometimes
* Whole-wheat bagels with cream cheese
* Toast
* Fruit: whatever's on hand, cherries
* Fiber-one bars (the walmart
* Rarely

**Lunch**:
* Most commonly
* Salads made from spinach, some cut-up cheddar cheese
* Cheese sandwiches

**Dinner**:
* Soup and grilled cheese
* Pasta
* Cheap frozen pizzas
* Veggie chili (canned
* Morningstar burgers with salads or frozen french fries
* Salads with pirogies and other veggies

**Snacks**:
* Mixed nuts
* We buy a lot of processed foods, dollar-store chips with cheese dip, cheese and fruit, etc.

So, but not our freezer is really tiny and taken up by the Morningstar stuff, frozen pizzas, pirogies, french fries, ice cream, etc. so I'd have to buy a bigger freezer. Any suggestions

Also, a local diner with good veggie food, and pizza/Italian restaurants. I eat at Taco Bell several times a week because I work there and get a half-off discount when I'm working. So an already cheap $5 meal (I usually get cheaper stuff, too) only costs me $2.50. In my mind that's pretty frugal, but I could be wrong.

Instead of purchasing the individual doses for the different sizes of your cats/dogs, and heartworm(note: it does not TREAT heartworm, only acts as a preventative)! Each bottle of the 88-110lb dose contains 5mls of the liquid(that's almost 6 months worth for one cat) which can easily be dosed down to treat all of your animals no matter what the size with a 3cc syringe(DON'T USE A NEEDLE, DUH).

The dosages are

0-10lbs = 0.4ml
11-20lbs = 0.8ml
21-30lbs = 1.2ml
31-40lbs = 1.6ml
41-50lbs = 2.0ml
51-60lbs = 2.5ml
61-70lbs = 3.0ml
71-80lbs = 3.5ml

For Frontline:

All Cats 0.5ml
Dogs 11-22 pounds = 0.67ml
Dogs 23-44 pounds = 1.34ml
Dogs 45-88 pounds = 2.68ml
Dogs 89-132 pounds = 4.0ml 

You may find, in a few instances, greedy volition. I had the honor of working under a vet who didn't like taking people for all they have. He is very honest and does anything he can to save you a few dollars. He was the only vet I worked for that actually told people they could do this and had to hide it from the other vet because he would get in trouble for not making more money for them. He will always be my favorite veterinary. I left the clinic because it was in a shelter and at times I would euthanize literal scores of animals a day. It, and the bureaucracy of a large non-profit facility, weighs on you after a few years. 

The other vets I worked for let myself, but did not want us advocating it to our clients, no matter how poor or flea infested they were. There are many testimonials on this thread now from other vet techs and from people who's vets were kind enough to share this method with them. 

WHEN DOSING YOUR ANIMALS: Always do it between the shoulders(especially for cats, it tastes horrible and you can't help but drool and foam at the taste. Your animal is only TRULY over dosed if they are foaming profusely, disoriented, and/or seizing. Seek IMMEDIATE veterinary care. Some cats may experience hairloss at the site of application, the hair will come back. If they get a scab(and it's a nasty scab) at the site of application, treat will a topical antibiotic and don't use the medication again.

OVERDOSING WILL NOT OCCUR IF YOU FOLLOW THE DOSAGE GUIDELINES.

Hopefully this was helpful and will save you a few dollars!

So there is no way I'm going to invest $1

Worth a shot! - So borrow a jack and some stands, right at the very bottom of the housing, looks like I probably hit a rock or something, just right. So I spray on some degreaser, clean up all the oil and get out my dremel tool, rough up the surface, and then mix up the JB weld. It goes on great and I let it harden up over night. The next day I pour in the oil and drive around, and no drips

We have lived in our apartment for nearly 3 years now.  I have ALWAYS questioned our energy usage.  Gas not so much

But even with using the central air I could not believe our bills were reaching $350 a month.  2 bedroom

This summer with my husband being unemployed we said enough is enough.  My husband went out to the AC itself and pulled fuse.  Problem solved

I complained to the Gas &amp; Electric company that they were over charging us.  They swore that our usage was older equipment or the likes.

So finally one day I had my husband shut off the power to our apartment completely at the breaker.  I went down to the meters and checked.  The one labeled with our apartment number did shut off.  

Then I decided to write down the meter number itself and compare that to my bill.  For the last 3 years I have been paying the eletrical bill of the upstairs neighbors who run their AC/Heat ALL THE DAMN TIME.  So going into the summer their bill has been going down while ours was going up!

&gt;Dear Wells Fargo

&gt;I would like to know the process of transferring funds from this account to a different accout at another bank.  Also

&gt;I am deeply disappointed in the e-mail I have just received about your change in policy.  I've been keeping up with the news of all the bad press about how ""Big Banks"" are stealing from regular people like myself and many of your customers.  This has especially been true of Bank of America.  My family has been with you for years

&gt;But now you are telling me you will be charging me fees for holding MY money?  MY money that YOU are spending and reinvesting for YOUR profits?  I barely gain any interest on my savings account,500 balance on my account.  But on principle, I can no longer be your customer.  I will also be recommending to my family members to switch banks.  I also hope other customers will do the same.


I'm thinking of switching to Charles Schwabb.  Do you guys have reason why I shouldn't?

Edit:  Thanks for the support and information guys.  I'm surprised this little rant somehow got to front page of r/Frugal.  I get it.  You want me to join a CREDIT UNION.  

So from what I learned for choosing against Charles Schwab:

* Credit unions offer higher interest rates and a credit card
* ~~ It is owned by Wells Fargo~~ I guess it's not owned by Wells Fargo
* CREDIT UNIONS R BEST!!!

I'll look into credit unions in my area.  It just seems really overwhelming of all the different choices and CS seems most convenient for me.  Thanks again.

*""We act as though comfort and luxury were the chief requirements of life

I think that ignorance of this simple principle (and

We humans seem to be hard-wired to seek novelty and change. One of the worst things most of us can imagine is a life of stagnation, completely unaware of the supernatural loop the character is stuck in, responds with: ""That pretty much sums up my life."" It's a horribly depressing thought, and people who are in that condition -- or afraid of falling into it -- will do almost anything to escape it.

But, or put together elaborate activities or services that look fun, and then very clever and insightful advertisers have packaged these things in ways designed to optimize their appeal to us. And all they want in exchange for this pre-packaged excitement is some of our hard-earned money.

So we give it to them. And in exchange, a nicer car, an enormous house or a big vacation. Now, don't get me wrong; I don't think there is anything wrong with spending money on these things if you can reasonably afford it and if it is something you will really use and enjoy. But all too often we, without even realizing it, buy them just because they are new and different -- i.e., something to get enthusiastic about -- and after the novelty has worn off

And, because they have made me realize that I can get that same level of enthusiasm for ""something new"" without having to spend much money -- or even any money at all.

Because ""something to be enthusiastic about"" can be an expensive new gadget, or a new friend to get to know. And I think that if more people realize that, we can take a big step towards curbing our tendency to live beyond our means.

I also thought I could teach friends to cook and that way I'd get to use their kitchen. 

 I will also get a gym membership for other things like shower (I work out frequently and part of the judo team). A friend also offered a car to sleep in. I'm also a polyphasic sleeper

I figured I can get 50 of my work hours back (that's before taxes and their newly implemented retirement plan) and free up another 400+utilities/month for the summer when I get back into school. If it goes well I plan to stay like this until I graduate out of college. 

I'm very minimalist so I don't really have anything of worth except my desktop computer. I'm storing my desktop away and using the money I save from first month's rent to buy a netbook or something (I was wondering what people thought of this, please offer).

I figured that I didn't need the place since I only come home to use the computer and to sleep for those 3 hours and those naps. Edit: And to shower and use the toilet.

I have already lined up people to take over my lease. What do you guys think about this? I'm doing it no matter what others may say but I thought I could get some good suggestions too. For example

**Edit:**

To make it easier of the reasons:

**Shower**: Gym Membership

**Toilet**: Any of the numerous bathrooms on campus. Or Parks.

**Brushing teeth

**Sleep**: Sleeps and Naps in Car, Library. I have a sleeping bag also to cover myself in the car.

**Internet**: Anywhere (College Town)

**Eat**: Work and cook with friends (To use kitchen)

Also to clarify:
I'm $2000 dollars in CC debt

**Edit 2**: Also I just wanted to say that Frugal is my favorite subreddit and I've really cut down on many things from reading here. Thanks everybody for making Frugal awesome!

**Edit 3:** I just got a message about not being able to do it and I believe I can. For background information, (averaged 3 APs) worked 20 hours a week, and took an extra 10 units of community college. I also help pay my mother's bills currently. I appreciate all the criticism you can give me however. It'll only make me stronger. 

**""Pain is temporary. It may last a minute, or a year, but eventually it will subside and something else will take its place. If I quit, however, it lasts forever.” - Lance Armstrong**

**Edit 4**: Thanks for everyone's advice and criticisms. I won't be following this post anymore except to specific replies but I wanted to learn what troubles may come of it, and how impractical people think it is. Thanks everyone and keep on your frugal habits (And enjoy life while you're at it).

If I understand it right, however, to **produce** two different products for these brands. 

Some shops' own brands are often produced at the same place as another

Important though, canned fruit, various sauces, oils, what have you are noticeably the same. Sometimes even the packaging is obviously the same, only the labels are different.
