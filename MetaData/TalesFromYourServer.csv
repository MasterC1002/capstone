1360603937.0,18bh1f,Absolutely worst super racist table of 20 I've had in 6 years of serving.  I hugged every co-worker when they left.  I'm not even a big hugger.  ,Inchoately,392,44,81,"Let me start by saying I usually never rant about tables.  Bad tables happen.  I've been doing this for six years at the same place and in line to start managing at a high volume casual dining restaurant.  I rarely have issues with my tables.  I can charm the pants off of preeeeetty much anybody.  

But

Last night

Party trickles in.  Not a big deal.  Had to tell a few guests how much alcoholic drinks were (not listed in our menu.) Gladly checked.  Drink ordering took a hot minute because of all the questions.  Fine with it.  I get it.  Finally they all show up at 5:30 and want to order.

Four people tell me their order at once.  FOUR.  Majority of party didn't even open the menu to read and had a multitude of questions.  My favorite:

Guest: ""You got potatoes?""  
Me: ""Yes ma'am.  Here is the page with the potatoes.""  
Guest: ""You ain't got no shrimp potatoes?""  
Me: ""No ma'am.  I can add a side of shrimp to anything.""  
Guest: ""So you ain't got no shrimp potatoes?""    
Me: "".....no.""  After taking an incredible amount of complicated and special orders, and I'll figure out how to get the kitchen to make it.""
Guest: ""How much would that be?""
Me: ""I'll have to go run a quote for you, alfredo, and fried shrimp on the potato with a side of broccoli.  Because, you know, restaurants serve that delicacy all the time.)  
Guest: ""I'll just get the grilled chicken potato.""  
NERDS!

I had to repeat soups of the day (listed in the menu) seven times.  SEVEN TIMES.  It took me about 20-30 minutes to get 20 orders. I'm still unshaken.  It's happened to me before.  I get it.  Some people don't go to restaurants often

At this point

They had extremely complicated separate checks, playing musical chairs, and changing their minds on who to pay for, I had it down. 

Food comes out.  Kitchen did mess up an order and gave a vegetarian teenage girl a turkey burger instead of a garden burger.  Our food runner was super new and grabbed the wrong item.  She took a bite.  She was rightfully upset

The only chance I had to make money was in the gratuity. She had the gall to complain about the *service* after I was running my ass off.

After they realized that could happen

The teenage side of the table started plain abusing me.  Every second I heard, chugging drinks.  It happens.  I'm plenty annoyed by the comps, but life goes on.  

I happened to hear one of the teenagers laugh and say

That.  That's when I lost it.  

I sat in the beer cooler

Their tab was $450.  The comps were $150.  That's $25 out of my pocket

Checks came out.  They saw the gratuity.  Complained.  Some got the grat off. I got stiffed by a few tabs.  One guest had two separate cards decline.  I get it.  I'm scraping by too.  She gave me at attitude like I did something wrong.  

Then

I had the table for 3 and a half hours during our rush.  I made $40 because some didn't want to pay the gratuity.  

Moreover, managers let it slide if the guests are obviously turds, but we only had over-zealous manager in training.

If my GM doesn't throw it out, this girl may have cost me $20,000-$30,000. (Base pay for dining managers dances around 50k.)       

Once they left, EVERYONE...even my creepy MIT who screwed me over yet still offers to take me for drinks.  I was SO happy that table was out of my life.  

Sorry about the length.  I don't even care if people read it! I just needed to write it.  Lord Jesus I hate working Sundays.  

**tl;dr Despite chipper attitude and best service I could offer,"" had over $150 in comps for no reason, most refused to pay gratuity, and a teenager complained about me having an attitude to get free meal and I may not be promoted to management because of it.**

1370273409.0,1fl2y1,Your gluten allergy is fake and I hate you,gateflan,458,119,187,"A server will never say this to your face but we all know your gluten allergy is fake. You are not allergic to gluten. You are just on a gluten-free diet and want attention. There are plenty of people who are truly allergic to gluten, and while it’s great that you’re feeling healthier, healthy

Your gluten allergy is fake because you discuss it at parties. Your gluten allergy is fake because it ‘comes and goes.’ Your gluten allergy is fake because you will eat at an Italian restaurant but walk away fine because you ordered the gluten free pasta. Your gluten allergy is fake because after reminding your server ten times that you’re highly allergic, please. Your gluten allergy is fake because you didn’t spend months or years in crippling pain and constant digestive distress before cutting gluten from your diet. Your gluten allergy is fake because you only realized you had the allergy after spending a day sick watching daytime television and hearing about the allergy on The View, shrieked at you by a dozen airheaded harpies who have latched on to gluten as the current ‘Number One Threat to Americans and Their Children.’ 

If you’re sure your gluten allergy is real because you cut out gluten and suddenly felt better, then don’t be surprised when you cut out pasta, processed bread products, and most desserts and are rewarded with a feeling of better health. You’re not dealing with an allergy, you’re on a diet. The Atkins and Paleo diet are both nearly gluten-free, and both are great diet options for people with weight and health issues. However, a change in health doesn’t mean there was an allergy involved. Real gluten allergies and Celiac disease cause vomiting, and crippling pain, I was allergic to gluten!’ is like saying ‘I stopped watching television sixteen hours a day, but it’s very important to know where ‘lifestyle change’ ends and ‘medical condition’ begins.

If you have a real gluten allergy, and range from a slight sensitivity to a severe allergy, and both can be controlled by limiting, and sometimes completely cutting out gluten intake. Some gluten sensitivities are so negligible that they might go completely unnoticed; some are so severe that even a few crumbs can cause serious discomfort for weeks. The most severe gluten-related condition is Celiac disease. The condition affects less than one percent of people, and while there is no cure, can be controlled by a strictly gluten-free diet and strict sanitation protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Living with Celiac disease is time and labor intensive, and no one suffering from the condition would be happy to hear about other faking the same symptoms. There’s nothing fun or trendy about having a medical condition that severely limits your diet. Tracie, told me that she couldn’t “understand why anyone would think this is fun, they number perhaps one in a hundred people

Having a gluten allergy is just another item on the list of trendy and socially acceptable disorders and diseases such as OCD and bipolar disorder. It’s common to see Facebook status updates along the lines of ‘cleaned my room today, especially in a restaurant.

People with true gluten allergies or Celiac disease don’t go to an Italian restaurant and order the fettuccine alfredo with gluten free pasta, every plate, every surface their food comes in contact with will need to be sanitized, and in a gluten-heavy environment, it’s impossible to guarantee such sterilization on a moment’s notice. Those with severe medical issues are acutely aware of how difficult it is to keep food sterile, and won’t take the chance. Those with sensitivities or tolerances might have no issue ordering a gluten-free version of a dish, because cutting out 95% of the gluten puts it within their realms of comfort. Even so, peanut-, but this doesn’t mean restaurant kitchens are dirty. Restaurant kitchens are cleaner than residential kitchens. Restaurant kitchens follow a lot of strict guidelines and constantly seek to maintain an ‘A’ health code rating. Even the cleanest residential kitchen might merit a C at best. However, not constantly

However, teaching him that the entire world revolves around his little need, and he has no personal obligation to educate himself on and avoid one of the world’s most popular agricultural products, being produced in excess of 30 million tons per year. And when that boy’s mother orders in a restaurant, she doesn’t take a moment to consider the menu, the venue, or any degree of reason when selecting her entree. She orders whatever she likes, she just asks for it to be modified. ‘Biscuits and gravy MOD: GLUTEN FREE’ printing out of the ticket printer can send the most seasoned chef into conniptions. Every ingredient in biscuits and gravy contains gluten, but remember that if you’re not in a gluten free restaurant

Allergies are taken very seriously to ensure the safety of customers, all day every day, and one slip-up might cause discomfort, severe pain, or hospitalization. In the case of a genuine allergy, most kitchens are willing to work very hard to ensure your safety. Wasting that much time and effort of an entire restaurant’s staff might seem unthinkable, but some customers think nothing of it as they announce their allergy to their server within the first thirty seconds of being seated. Dealing with an allergy throws an entire kitchen out of its rhythm, fresh knives, and fresh cookware

So I was hosting last Saturday, and i even managed to strike up a conversation with a cool guy in a 12-top by the name of Dave(relevant later). It was around 12 that I encountered a 11-top party that was (apparently) celebrating a daughter's graduation from nursing school. The mother of the girl (let's call her bitchmom) came up to me to check in, and I informed them that it would be about a 30 to 45-minute wait, since we had 3 large parties on the wait in front of them. The bitch stare she gave me could melt steel as she begrudgingly took a pager and sat down with her party. 

I was chatting with dave for a short while when 20 minutes later, they call up Dave's party and seat them. Bitchmom gets pissed and asks me why they would seat a bigger party than theirs when she and her party were ""obviously here first."" I informed her than Dave's party had been patiently waiting for almost 50 minutes. Bitchmom obviously didn't believe me, so in the snottiest tone, she said ""You know what? Lemme speak to y'all's manager. I ain't happy with this shit"".  As I'm calling over my manager, she proceeds to bitch me out on my ""shitty service"" when around this time, Dave passes by on his way to the restroom and happens to catch the process. He walks up to her straight up, and asks her what her problem is with me. Her death stare while she bitched him out about me was so evil, and bitchmom outright LIES about me (saying I had seated parties that had just gotten here, polite employee he's had the chance of meeting.

Background on me: I'm a burly dude with tattoos and a giant beard, I'm not an ass.  Due to the fact that at this point of my life I was a recent veteran and just didn't have time for stupid customer BS there wasn't a lot I put up with. After you've been through some of the shit I've been through, the customer not having the correct amount of ice cubes in their beverage just doesn't seem to matter much to me. My deal is this; part of the respect I'm giving you is assuming you're an adult and holding you to that standard. This means I expect you to treat people with decency and do right.  Just don't be doucher and we'll be cool. 

Now on to the tale:

I knew the table was going to be about as fun as a bag of razor blades when I walked up to greet them and instead of returning my greeting they just barked out their drink orders. Nothing says ""hello, and he wants an iced tea"". But what can you do? They're not sociable people, fine, I still have a job to do. I went and fetched their springs. Apparently I've been relegated to wench tonight.

When I returned with drinks there was 10 dollars in singles sitting on the end of the table. The clown who was obviously in charge of this bubbly and outgoing crew had placed them there. He said to me gruffly

In my head I said

What I really said, you want to hold on to this, the bussers might get confused and think it was left from the table before you. I will give you the same service I give all of my tables; excellent. At the end of your meal when the bill comes you can then decide what amount of tip you'd like to leave."" And before he could respond I added ""Would you guys like to start with an appetizer?""

This story is one from my younger sister, stories like the one that follow absolutely infuriate me.

This was from about 7 years ago when she was a fresh from high-school grad working at a national chain of sit-down restaurants that isn't exactly a high-class joint

Over the years, it is the horrific tale of a group of the cheapest, most self-entitled people she has ever met.

There was a particular group of regulars that would come in every 3rd or 4th Sunday at 12:15pm on the nose. They knew it all; how to sit (spreading out over 3-4 tables at times) and divide their checks to avoid paying the automatically included gratuity for large parties, and even caught one of them (see below). There's no way 12-15 people can go through an entire gallon, yes, gallon, of salsa with appropriate amount of chips and still be hungry for an actual meal. Well, that's the trick, 1/2 of them didn't ever order, none of them ever ordered together

This continued

They had came in with their usual routine, total. My awesome sister (A.S.) was used to the routine, and so had 5 glasses of water on each table and enough chips and salsa to satisfy a herd of angry water buffalo, all before the 4th person, much less 5-10 had shown up.

The moment she saw what happened next she knew she was in for some fun. She had made it almost a game at this point

The head honcho, pulls out a 1 gallon zipper bag, and DUMPS a basket of chips into the bag. A.S. must have startled him as he jerked back quickly, spilling about a third of the contents of the basket onto the floor directly under, you guessed it, his kid's feet.

This could get long(er) if I continue through the many more details she shared with me about this group

About 2 hours after PJ, the party decides for the first time ever, that they all want to leave together. A.S., being her usual well prepared but glass-half-empty self, has their individual checks printed and ready for them to GTFO. That is when all hell broke loose.

The GM of the store, not to mention frequent non-monetary tips), had decided that they could no longer skate around the automatic 6+ guest gratuity.

Well this was a NOOOOO GOOOOO for PJ

Their individual checks, and 4 people respectively, were (about) $30, $35, and $45, INCLUDING the 15% gratuity. Not a huge deal right? I mean, it's like $4, PJ demanded

My sister knew what was up, who was already on his way up front after seeing the commotion on the security cameras.

PJ then demands, PJ and his posse of padres finally give in a pay their bills and quickly leave, vowing to never return. Good riddance.

That's the end right? Nope, a pocket bible with a played out inspirational quote on the inside cover and a fresh crisp $1 bill! Oh wow, a whole dollar!

Needless to say, he demands that she return his fresh crisp $1 bill, reasoning out loud that she'll ""need the pocket bible to read on your trip to hell.""

What.. The.. FUCK?!?!

My sister, ""Which one was yours again?""

She said she thought he was going to hit her for a moment, sweat pouring off his eyebrow from the pure unadulterated rage he was experiencing for what appeared to be the first time ever and just turned and walked out. In case you don't know one personally, it takes quite a show to render a southern baptist preacher speechless.

1374093761.0,1iif1n,Flight attendants mean business.,JesusSwallows,255,31,39,"Hey guys! I hope flight attendant stories fit in here!

This is my mom's story. She's been a flight attendant for almost 35 years now and has earned numerous accolades from her airline and high-level frequent fliers for her phenomenal service. I've never met anyone who works harder or who loves his/her job more.

She is an extremely patient person as well, however, post-9/11 the FAA granted flight attendants a lot more jurisdiction over whether P.A.L.D.s (Passengers Acting Like Dicks) fly or not. My mom hardly ever exercises this authority (certainly not as much as other flight attendants), but the douche canoe in this story earned it.

My mom was working her favorite trip - Portland to Maui - and was greeting passengers on a Thursday morning flight boarding in PDX. The airline had recently begun flying to Hawaii, even new Hawaii-themed uniforms for the flight crew). Everyone was in a great mood, passengers and crew, until this guy boards.

He's immediately rude, and obviously drunk off his ass. Behind him is his exasperated young wife, towing a horse-sized diaper bag and their two young, tired-looking kids. The guy remarks to my mom ""You gonna get those drinks comin', hun?"" and laughs like a loon as soon as he steps foot on the plane.

Once they get seated (the guy refuses to sit down or help his wife get their two kids situated), complete with LOUD profanity. There are a lot of families and young children on this flight, including his own.

All his antics so far are annoying, meaning a delay, meaning less time my mom has on the ground in Maui to snorkel (this bitch LOVES her some snorkeling). Another flight attendant had asked him politely three times, the third request receiving a ""Jesus, calm the fuck down!""

Oh heeeeeelllll no. My mom PAs the crew in the back galley saying she's booting him. This guy will only get drunker

But she remembers this flight's captain is Steve, and his connections in Seattle helped me get my first job). Awesome guy who won't let anyone do anything to ""his girls"" -- and says so again to my mom. She heads back to deal with Asshat McGee.

She informs him, that the captain has deemed him a security risk, and that he must deplane. This guy naturally goes apeshit, screaming things like ""So you're gonna ruin my kids' vacation? What the FUCK!"" My mom maintains her composure and tells him that the airline will book him on the next flight, provided he deplanes peacefully (without security) and sobers up.

The guy continues his tirade, ""Ma'am, there is no need for you or your children to deplane. Your husband can meet you in Maui if he takes this evening's flight."" The wife looks a bit torn for a second, then turns on her husband with a look of pure ice. ""Don't ruin this.""

My mom's been divorced, muttered ""Man, this is bullshit"", but deplaned. They were able to take off only 10 minutes behind schedule.

While the kids cried a bit at their dad leaving, but the flight crew and even neighboring passengers consoled her. My mom gave the woman a bottle of wine from first class when they landed.

A few weeks later

**TL;DR** my mom kicked a guy off a plane for being a doucher.

First and foremost, but I guess everyone has a limit.

This happened at the same location of [Pasta Nipples](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1hes2z/pasta_nipples_nsfw/)

This place was a late nite bar, and one would be a ""shot girl.""  This night it was me.  Yippee.

A shot girl walked around with this crappy plastic tray, which I later learned because the GM was pocketing all the cash from the sales.  OH, and you weren't allowed to clock in if you were shot girl, and you only made tip money.  You can imagine how much people love to tip you when all you're doing is walking around with a tray and begging people to buy some.  

ANYWAY.  I was the shot girl, and then SHE walks in.

She is the boss' best friend.  She looks to be about 55, she announces her arrival, never orders just says ""the usual,"" even though ""the usual"" is a different drink every night.  She's been known for starting fights, stealing, breaking dishes, assaulting employees, etc.  But since she's the GM's best friend

So tonight I was her target.  It started off with her grabbing me by the ear and dragging me to her table.  Yes, and tell her the total.  She tells me to stop being a ""fucking sloppy cunt and buzz off.""  Nope, need cash.  Now.  She continues.  I go grab the bouncer and let him know, he says talk to the boss.  I do, he tells me to give her whatever she wants, just keep track of how many.  Cool.  I go back to work.

Over the course of the night, causing me to spill my tray both times, for shits and giggles I assume.  She even spit on me while I was on the floor cleaning up the mess she caused.

Enough was enough.  I couldn't take it.  The boss thought she was funny, took a smoke break outside and decided to plot my revenge.  Then, I remembered.  At about 1:30, the kitchen would give me some tacos and salsa to throw on the tray to try to sell at the end of the night, along with the shots.  The salsa was in the exact same type of ramekin as the jell-o shots.  And it was red, like her favorite flavor of cherry.  So I grabbed a salsa, threw some tabasco, pepper, mixed it up

Aaaaaand she did.  She yelled ""HEY SHOT CUNT!""

I looked over

She growls with a grin that would scare a shark

Keep in mind, I took the last 2 months off because I had broken my shoulder (and of course, it had to be my tray arm). So I can't carry as much as I used to be able to, which makes me slow.

I kindly ask for her to stop, and that I would be with her in a minute. During this process, my credit card machine timed out, so I had to redo everything again. While I am doing this, I feel the Evil Lady tugging on my pants again, I was wearing a G-string

Last week, and without ever meeting the ex, keyed the word bitch into both of her cars. She slipped at one point and needed 16 stitches in her arm as a result. She then called out the next day saying she couldn't leave her house because the ex was outside waiting to beat her up. 

I am legitimately scared to work with her tonight. I'm scared she knows I told the manager everything Monday, or try to get me fired again. The owner said to report and document for the next week so he has grounds to fire her. A coworker informed me she was continuing her old tricks lastnight, so she may be unaware she is being watched.

So anyway, do my intro, then ask what they'd like to drink. Immediately I knew they'd be trouble. The first thing out of their mouths went something like this:

Lady1: You mean that other guy isn't getting us our waters?    
Me: Oh
Lady1: Mmhrm

So I bring them their waters, it seems ok. Then Lady1 blurts out, ""When are you bringing our bread?"" Bread doesn't come out automatically at my restaurant, and she was throwing so many other questions at me, I didn't get a chance to ask before she did.

As their food comes out, I don't really have any control over the food presentation, our manager/owner does. I had assumed the little ramekin on their plate was bernaise, not remoulade; they needed the remoulade for their shrimp anyway, so it was supposed to be on the plate. So food gets to their table and Lady1 immediately complains that it is not bernaise and is ""too orange."" I say, ""I'm honestly not entirely sure if that's bernaise or not. Lemme go check for you."" (Smiling, I have to add.)

As I'm coming back to check on them after a minute,    
Lady1: Hey

Lady1: Yeah. It was your fault.    
Me: If there's anything else y'all would like
Lady1: Whatever.

They then apparently complained to the manager that their ""server was extremely rude"" and they'd like their meal for free. My manager knew what was going on

It all worked out and my neighboring table ended up leaving me a ridiculous 80% tip as well as telling the managers how great my service was.

1365608727.0,1c2h9v,I Should Have Been Fired For This,ChazoftheWasteland,214,41,30,"There are many reasons that I should have been fired from the Oldest Beer Bar in DC (Now Reopened Under New Owners)

It was a hot summer Saturday, and most of the equipment looked like it had been there since then.  There are almost no windows in the restaurant, so we couldn't even get a breeze.  The menu listed over 1200 beers, but we likely only had about 400 different types on a good day.  Heat, outlying menu, and crowded conditions combined to wreck a lot of customers fun, but we tried to help everyone have a good time.  For the most part, and knowing beer like goddam experts.

In DC in the summer, I've had a whole three tables, but I can't be cut until 3 am due to management stupidity.  One of my fellow waitrons has a table of 12 that has been there for a few hours, and is in the process of dividing their tab, paying, and leaving.  We are not allowed to auto-grat anyone, so she is in the process of making about 10% in tips thanks to stupid college students.  The kids are telling each other that Craig and Trixie will handle tip because they bought some of his/her beers

So the final three people are still sitting there, and they haven't ordered anything but water now for an hour and a half.  My coworker asks for advice, and I suggest she stop giving them water.  Just disappear, and we'll have the manager go over and ask if they need anything besides the bill.  This works, and the dude magnanimously offers to pay for the whole remaining bill.  So Coworker brings his credit slip back, and the dude tips her $5 on 100...she again asks for advice because she can't even think straight.  That table had run her so ragged, and it was so hot in the restaurant

We pep her up and suggest that she follow the established, maybe she had done something he didn't like?  He explains that he thought everyone else tipped her.  She explains that she was tipped on their portions of the bill, and that this is his portion to tip on.  I'm two tables away, refilling salt shakers or something, and I see him turn beet red.  The two girls with him look around awkwardly.  He says that he'll take care of it, and Coworker returns to the front of the restaurant.  

The three students leave saying, you were so nice and helpful...blahblahblah""  The verbal tip...shit.  Coworker comes back from the table with the credit slip in hand, and looks at it, and says ""Oh my god, I can't believe this.""  The little shit had crossed out the tip and written on the back, ""SO RUDE INAPPRORAPE""  Spelling mistake as in the original.

At this point, I am going to make sure that fucker never comes back.  I stand up, and hear the manager saying, ""No, don't!"" as I walk out the door.  I probably had MURDER all over my face.  I catch up to the students down the street at a corner which is a hang out spot for older gay men and people who are probably dressing in drag from the nearby gay bar.  The kids are laughing about my Coworker, saying ""What a stupid bitch!""  And ""What part of tipping is optional did you not understand?""  I walk right up to customers, and yell, EVER DO THAT TO ANOTHER SERVER, debating on whether to say anything else.  One of the people hanging out on the corner yells, and I turn and walk back to the restaurant.

My coworkers are all standing on the steps, ""so am I fired?""

I get a 2 top (husband and wife) and go to greet them. The wife immediately asks for our gluten free menu. We don't and never have had one. She argues with me that the hosts told her that we had one. Again, very sick"" if she has any. I figured that a 40+ yr old woman with a severe allergy could handle herself. 

Before I can even get a drink order, I ask what they would like to drink. Wife asks me if any of our beers are gluten free. I wasn't 100% sure so I went to find out. Of course they aren't and so I go back and tell her so. It's not a problem but she needs a few mins with the menu so I go get them waters. 

I come back a few minutes later and ask if she has any questions or anything. She tells me she's not going to order because there's nothing she can eat. By now I'm extremely busy and a little annoyed. I open the menu and start pointing out things that are obviously gluten free, things that someone with a ""severe gluten allergy"" would order. She then tells me she's a vegetarian. 

WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU EAT.

Alright, so whatever, I don't have time to argue with her. He gets his beer, they're happy. 

I'm keeping an eye on them and when he's about done with his beer I ask if he would like another or if he's ready for his check. He asks me about his food. WHAAAAAAT. Turns out he was still going to eat. I was under the impression that they both weren't eating. Shit fuck. I explain that to him and tell him I'll get his stuff out right away. Fortunately what he ordered was pretty quick

Things clear out a bit and I'm cleaning up my section. I'm wiping down the table next to them and glance over to see how they're doing. Apparently

Sorry this was so long.

Given the wonderful horror stories we all read on this sub, both involving grandparents and their granddaughters. 

* * *
A few weeks back, and always said, ""Please,"" and, ""Thank you.""  The granddaughter, however, was quite the stuck up little brat. Always on her cell phone, and always demanding her refills - not asking. Every single time she did this

Well, was handed a credit card from the grandfather, and processed it. After I returned it him, I began to pre-bus the table. As I was doing so, the gentleman discreetly filled out the tip receipt for me. I never pay attention to when customers do this out fear that they might be uncomfortable with me watching. So I was in my own little ""Get the dishes and go"" world and just about to step away from the table when the granddaughter says, rather loudly, ""Are you really leaving THAT MUCH of a tip?! Seriously?!""

That's when grandpa lost it. 

He looked at her dead in the eye, ""Why, yes, I AM. This is what a fifteen percent tip looks like. You go to school, don't you? You learned math, did you not?""  Stunned at grandpa's sudden snap, an awkward silence followed from her.

""Answer me when I speak to you

She had barely replied a meek,"" when he continued on.

""I know your momma taught you social graces, and showed it to him. 

""Just what I thought. Now: This man has given us good service. Every single time he came to this table, I'd make you pay this tip. But you don't. So don't you ever question my generosity on behalf of *your behavior* again. 

""When a man works hard to give you good service

The girl,"" which I accepted as politely as I could. After he handed me the tip slip, I excused myself from the table. As I was walking away, I overheard the grandfather also force this girl to apologize to her grandmother and her brother for ""embarrassing them.""

Instead of walking away

This second one provides a great moment from a lady (and I do mean 'lady' in every positive

I had three women at my table tonight, sisters), and the other one was the granddaughter of one of them.

Throughout the night the older ladies and I had a great banter going between us

Needless to say, soup and salad are as endless as man's ignorance, and I frequently have to check with my guests to know if they would like any more. 

So, ""More soup or salad, ladies?""  The grandmother replies, ""Oh, I don't know about these two, but I'm fine."" The other elder lady says, ""No more for me, who is bent over and staring into her lap beneath the table. 

Without warning, spine rigid. I jumped half-an-inch in my shoes and every other adjacent table snapped their heads to this woman. She, as if the world around her did not exist, looked at this girl as a Sargent would a Private about to receive a dressing down.

""I will not tell you again, or even with your daddy. When you sit at *my* table and *my* money is what is putting food in *your* belly, you will not *TOUCH* your cellular phone. Do you understand me?""

(*a beat passes*)

""Do. You. Understand me?""

""Yes, set it down, and slid it ever so gently across to grandma, who promptly took it, and put it her purse.

""Now. The man asked you a question. Answer him.""

This teenaged girl looked to me with this pleading look in her eye

So did grandma. 

""Oh? You mean you can't answer him because you can't talk to, you don't get any.""  She then looked to me, and - I swear - gave me a sly wink and a smile, and said, ""We are fine, sir. Thank you for your continued service.""

Tonight, and we got a decent bump around 6 tonight, with each of us getting 4 tables in ~30 minutes.  The last table I got from that bump was a couple who was super nice right off the bat, asking me how I was, and telling me they'd never had Malaysian food before.  I gave them a few recommendations, and they ordered a bottle of wine, which is pretty uncommon for us.  When I came back, and the rest of my section was either chowing down, and as I was about to walk away, I knew they were going to be awesome.

So, just some wok-fried pot stickers, and after they had their first bite, they were already heaping complements on the food.  If there's one thing my restaurant does right, it's the quality of the food.  Right as they finished the pot-stickers, their entrees rolled out.  I poured more wine, served the entrees, the woman just burst out telling me how amazing the food I had recommended was.  They honestly heaped praise on me for my descriptions and how I ""couldn't have pointed [them] towards something more delicious.""  Every time I checked back with them

It ended up being an early night and they were my last table.  They'd devoured every bite in front of them, when I was pulling their plates, I heard them talking about ""Pollos Hermanos"" and we all got in a 10 minute discussion about Breaking Bad, which made them even happier about having me as their server.

This is about two years ago in the middle of summer.

At the current restaurant I was working at we were open until 12 midnight
This was mostly because we weren't really known for our alcoholic drinks and during the summer management wanted to emphasize our alcohol sales.

On to the story.

So a couple comes in at about 10pm, the works. At about quarter to eleven they tell me that the lady's mom was going to be joining them in about half an hour. Sure no problem I say, and I let them know that the kitchen is closed at 11, therefore if she would like to order anything I would be more than happy to punch something in before she gets here, that way she can eat if she wants too.
So the woman calls her mom and let's her know the deal, she just wanted to come in and have a few drinks.
Awesome.

So it's about 11:20 by now and the mom shows up, and she says no, she wants to order something now. 

""Ahhhh shit""
I politely inform her that the kitchen closed 20 minutes go and unfortunately she can't order food anymore. Cue the shit storm.
She begins to go off on me. ""Well what do you mean I can't order food

Again I tell her that while we are open until 12

She then tells me me that when her daughter told her that the kitchen closes at 11

""I don't want anything big

At this point I'm getting annoyed

""I'm really sorry

Now she is visibly pissed.
""Well it's not hard to heat something up

I go on to tell her that even if I was allowed to make food (Hint: I'm not) the grills and pans would take up to 20 minutes just to heat up

Then the kicker
""Then why did you let me in if you can't even make me food?! This is ridiculous

I snap. 
""Look, and your acquaintances multiple times that the kitchen closes at 11. It says on the door. If you want food the only things I can offer you are drink garnishes. If you want a spicy bean or maraschino cherry, with a side of limes then you are in luck because that's all I've got.""

**A BIT OF BACKGROUND**
So, the standard 60 minute wait time, everyone shows up at the same time, everyone leaves at the same time, I'm the only busser... but y'all already know that stuff. 

**STORY TIME**
Now, no big deal. Well, as I'm cleaning a table so that we can seat some people, I see some lady waving me over to her. So, I head over there to see if there is anything i can help her with. About 3 tables before I reach her booth, I notice multiple Long Island Iced Tea glasses at her booth. Then, this little thing happens. 

 * Drunk Woman: ""Are you my server?""
 * Me: ""No Ma'am
 * Drunk: ""No
 * Me: ""I'll be right back Ma'am.""

I walk into the kitchen and ask who the server for table ###. Well, military haircut. Their server... A tall black (no racism intended) girl, late teens, somewhat long hair. Still confused? Well, the ladies at the table still were. 

 * Me: ""Ma'am
 * Drunk: ""Oh
 * Me and Abby: (in our minda: *Wut...*)
 * Abby: ""Ma'am
 * Drunk: ""Another Long Island Iced Tea.""
 * Abby: ""One moment please.""

Now

 * Abby: ""Hey, but want more Long Island Iced Teas. What do you want me to do?""
 * Tom: ""I'll handle this.""

Now, so I have no idea what he said to them. All i know is that he walked away, the lady who thought I was a skinny black girl, got up, took two steps... and fell on her face. I was cut about 5 minutes later, and leave right before they do. Being that I was hit by a drunk driver and messed up my back a few years ago, I was not about to let them drive away drunk. So... I did what any right minded person would do. I got in my car, and pulled infront of them. I had already punched 911 into my phone and all I had to do was hit call. Once their car started up

About 5 minutes later, and they started driving... and crashed into the cop car. The officer was already out, so he was fine. The ladies were arrested for drunk driving, the officer asked if anything happened to me, and thanked me for calling in.

I bring the food out to them and notice the female side of AC is not there.

Me: ""Oh

Angry Couple Male: ""No

I go back inside, still hasn't touched his pasta.  I again offer to keep it warm in the kitchen to which he snarls something at me and I leave.  Fine, whatever, I have a nice big ass tv in the bar I can watch while I wait.

25... seriously, thats a good 30 minutes their food has been out.  I give it a minute then head out.

Me: ""How's everything tasting?""

Angry Couple Girl: ""My fritatta is overcooked

I just stare at her. Confused. Of course it tastes like shit. It's eggs and salmon. Sitting out. In hot weather. For 30 minutes.

ACG: ""I want a new one. (Slides plate across the table) Tell them not to overcook it this time

Again

I take it back, she fucking snapped her finger at me.  I hold in my rage, and turn around.  She's not even looking at me, points to at her coffee cup and rolls her eyes to her boyfriend.  I stand there in shock.

Me: (full sarcasm put in to my voice at this point) ""I'm sorry

ACG: ""Well I'm pointing at my coffee cup. You draw your own conclusions. (another eye roll)

Me: ""Oh

ACG: (Huge audible sigh) ""I. Want. More. Coffee. Leave the cup and get me more coffee.""

Me: ""Sure! IT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE! Oh, you were gone for about a half hour, and your food sat at the table.  Eggs don't sit well.  They cook themselves after sitting for a bit. Not to mention that you complained it was cold and tasted bad, and well, obviously it would be sitting out for 30 minutes.""

ACG: ""How about I just sit here for another 30 minutes and see if it tastes the same? Take your smug attitude and get me coffee.""

At this point I couldn't take anymore.  I can't even make this stuff up.  I just walked away. I went and sat at the bar.  I contemplated kicking them out (I wouldn't have gotten in trouble at all for it, printed their bill, walked up to their table, dropped it off, and started to walk off.

ACG: ""Excuse me! My coffee!""

Annnd I kept walking. Right to the bar and sat my ass down again.  I waited another minute, he followed behind. No tip. Wasn't expecting one. Don't care.

Last time they were in, they were pretty unhappy as the service as the waitress was slammed with about 10 other tables to tend to. Furthermore, they tend to complain about little things and make a big deal out of them when they can be easily fixed or attended to once brought up. This being said, I wanted to make sure everything was in perfect order for their visit. I saw them right away, beer never empty, got their sushi plates out quite fast and all. 

I go by to see them a couple times throughout my rush, things are still good, etc.

Me (in my head): ""So the sushi is so crappy that you had to try nearly all of it but waited to complain to me at the end when I could have had it remade and all?? UGH.""

So they finish every single piece to the point that they are beyond stuffed. I clear everything, since they were ""dissatisfied"" with their food. They eventually take 2 desserts, enjoy them slowly and thank  me repeatedly for my wonderful service and attentiveness to their concerns.

I worked fine dining in NY for a while in my late teens. I was a server at a fairly swank place. The clientele wasn't too terrible and I enjoyed what I did. Then there were the Hendersons. (name changed to protect the rude.)

They were a couple in their mid-thirties, they would NEVER get a babysitter. They had two girls aged 6 and 4 who would run off as soon and Mum and Dad's asses hit their seats. Let me just say first: I detest children. But they love me, and these girls were no exception. They would follow me around the restaurant, chattering at me about school and their friends and their family life. A couple of times I caught them taking tips off of empty tables but they cut that shit out when I scolded them. If I told them to return to their parents, the parents would literally shoo them back to me. The FM did nothing to help me since the parents were big weekly spenders. So Friday nights were babysitting nights in my section.

A couple weeks before I left the restaurant to move west, comes barreling down the line, scoops up the little girl and takes her to the dish tank where he runs cold water over her finger. I was apologizing to him but he wasn't angry with me. He asked the little girl's sister where her parents were and took the kids over there while I ran food. He was very polite to the parents, telling them that the restaurant was no place for children to run wild, and the mother (who was fucking wasted) tore into him for a) touching her child and b) telling her how to parent. Chef's face was purple at this point. He hated customers. He just set the kid down and left and my FM had to go over and calm Mrs down. Gave them a discount and they stiffed me on the tip.

I left and FM called me a couple months later with some news. Since I left,  no other server would allow the kids to follow them, and the family had to eat...wait for it...TOGETHER.

1. People with manners. Please and thank you aren't dead. And if your children have manners? My goodness, enunciate... if you do all of those? Thank you.
  

2. People who are understanding. Honestly, but I accidentally get you a refill of regular Coke. If you wait is 15 minutes longer than what they quoted you.... THANK YOU for being understanding and not biting my head off about it.  Thank you for being calm, kind and generally a good person who knows that sometimes stuff happens.  Also, people who don't get mad when we don't have something. ""You're out of filet medallions? Okay, no big deal, I'll have blah blah blah..."" Thank you for that. Really.
  

3. People who let our managers know when they've had a good dining experience. This is a big one. Managers get complaints ALL the time, whether I gave you great service, your food was fantastic, the atmosphere was wonderful.. whatever it is. If it was better than what you were expecting (and especially if it was better than your previous visit) ask your server for a manager and tell them. It's fantastic feedback.  
  

4. If you remember my name, really.  Even if you're only doing it to be polite...it makes up for the person before you who almost made me cry because they were so rude.  
  
5. Guests who SEE me.  I don't know, helpful woman doing my job. Not a mindless robot programmed to bring your food and drinks and vanish into the scenery.  
  
6. People who honestly let me know if something isn't right with their meal.  I really DO care that you have a good experience. Honestly.  If your applesauce isn't cold enough, I just know that if it were me, I'd want the food I'm paying for to be right.  I just want the same for you. So if you're honest? Thank you! :)
  
7. Polite teenagers. Oh my goodness... if you are a teenager and you look me in the eye and have manners??? You are also a rarity and to be held up as an example. Thank you so much and please
  
8. People who give credit where credit is due.  As I pointed out in the previous 10, people who ask me to pass their compliments on to the chefs? You rock.  
  
9. People who make me laugh are awesome. It definitely breaks up the monotony. If you're creative or say something off the wall
  
10. I write ""Thank you"" on all of my checks. If it's a widely recognized day like St. Patty's Day or something, we love you.   
  

Once, and I got reprimanded for it.  Another guest saw all of this. Not only did they pull the manager aside and tell them what really happened (the manager apologized to me) they also left me $30.00 on like a $10.00 bill.

You are a very sweet young lady and I can't understand why anyone would be motivated to behave in such a manner.

It was at the second job where I ended up getting the greatest tip ever from a customer.

It was a Saturday night, we'll call her Tara, who was a really good looking brunette in her late 20s, saw the lack of money I was getting from these tables and threw me a bone at 7pm, two hours before close.

**Tara: I've got a special table for you. It will be your only table for the rest of the night.**

*Me: Okay...what is it?*

**Tara: It's a table full of businessmen. They all had at least one cocktail in the bar before coming in. They're going to spend a lot of money.**

*Me: Alright...but shouldn't you take it?*

It's worth noting at this point that I'm a guy, it became pretty clear that they weren't there for fun. It was two companies out of the Twin Cities that were trying to strike up some kind of deal. We had roped off the section they were in so there weren't many distractions. I came by and took their orders, with each of them ordering either prime rib or porterhouse steak, each plate going at about $20 a clip, so the food bill was about $300 alone. All of them were drinking top shelf liquor, so the costs there varied based on what they were getting, but it was obvious not a single one of them cared about the cost. I did find it strange that an important business deal was being struck and every single one of them was drinking, I understand why they did that. Being an adult sucks sometimes

The man who was put in charge of organizing everything told me to stay close but they needed to be left alone. I told them if any of them needed anything

Closing time rolls around and they were about wrapped up

The final bill was over $600, they are black and gold (or silver, depending on the region I've been told), are made of titanium, and basically have no credit limit. You have to pay a one time fee of $7,500 and an annual fee of $5,000 just to have it. I've read that a Gulfstream V private jetliner was purchased with a Centurion Card once.

I took the card from him and walked it over to our bar area, and said to me: You are about to get a big tip.

I kind of laughed it off, leaving them be to wrap up their deal. They left laughing, so I have to assume that some deal was struck.

The gentleman who was in charge came up to me as he was leaving and handed the check back to me that was in the standard black holder you see at every restaurant.

**You did a great job tonight. I hope you do well in college.**

He left and I didn't even check how much he tipped me as I was finishing up stocking our silverware. Tara came back over to me after he had left with a smile on her face.

**Tara: Well? How much did he tip you?**

I opened it up and about fell over.

*Me: ....he rounded it up to $1000. The bill was just over $600.*

**Tara: You owe me a drink.**

The tip itself was about $375. Needless to say

I greet them as usual and everyone but the boy is nice, but they were awesome and it's at our discretion if we want to bend the rules or not.)   The dad orders a tall beer and everyone else gets soda.  I run the drinks and they order an appetizer. So, I ring in the appetizer and bring them more rolls, giving them time to chat.  As the night goes on, the boy's soda and the dad's beer slowly edge toward the middle of the table (they're sitting across one another) and by the time the app arrives and I take their dinner order, the beer and soda are side by side. 
 
  
This makes it pretty obvious.  The beer has only had a few ounces sipped from it (it's a tall 23 oz. mug) and it's in the middle of the table... I'm now watching for this boy sipping Daddy's beer.   As they clearly aren't going to do it while I'm there

Long story short, steadily gets more and more pissed as I explain the rule (because the son kept questioning me.)  
  
Problem number 2.  Idiot boy ordered chicken tenders, before all of this, when they're ordering, he says he wants ""Chicken tenders with no crispy stuff on em. Just chicken.""  I confirmed ""So you'd like the chicken critters, grilled?""  He said yes.. done deal, right?   

 

Wrong. 

  
After being pissed about his lack of beer, saying that what was on the plate was something else.   
  
When he can't even find ""chicken tenders"" (because that doesn't exist) he points to the item he's now claiming he wanted.  
  
Country Fried Chicken - A tender chicken breast
  
A ""tender chicken breast"".. not ""fried chicken tenders"" I point this out to him
  
*THE WORDS ARE RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM ON THE MENU AND HE STILL INSISTS I'M WRONG* saying he's reading ""chicken tenders* right there.  At this point, I gave up.  I asked a FINAL time if he wanted his meal fixed, and he said no.  He just sat there and pouted like the child he was for a few minutes, then begrudgingly ate the chicken he ordered.  
  
I'd had enough. I went and got my manager (who is also the owner) and asked him to speak with them because the boy was pissed.  I explained about the beer
  
The brat then proceeds to yell at my manager about my stupidity and how I was rude about his beer and how I ordered his food wrong.  My manager explained that being rude wasn't necessary

**Background**
I'm not a server now

Anyway, and scurry back by in about 10 minutes to pick up payment.  Some people were slow as hell and waited til the very last credit rolled before they paid, but most paid the first pass through.

**Weird Server Story here**
After dropping tabs, when I actually looked at the paper and noticed it had **$20** written on it.  

I stopped and kind of chuckled but said

Man: ""There it is.""  (Gesturing to the paper)
Me: ""...""
Man: ""That's $20.""
Me: ""Sir...this is a piece of paper you wrote on.  You have to pay...with money.""
Man: ""That's good for $20.""
Me: ""...you have to PAY.  With MONEY.  I need a credit card
Man: ""There you go."" (still gesturing to the paper)

I was completely flummoxed.  Keep in mind all of this is whispered conversation in the dark.  I finally had to get my manager and the guy still refused to pay.  Eventually they called the cops.  I can't remember now if he ever paid or not.  It was really weird.  I had spoken to that group before the movie started and they *seemed* normal

So yesterday I go in on my day off to put in a full two weeks notice. I wait almost an hour for my manger to get out of a meeting and follow her into her office just long enough for her to verbally berate me. I tell her how much I really have enjoyed working there but that financially it's an opportunity I can't pass up. She tosses a whatever at me and tells me I have to put in a written notice. I go back up front and write up said notice and give it to her. She then comes back and starts yelling at me at the bar infront of everyone. This is when another waitress (who in no way is my superior) gets in on the action and I now have two people basically telling me what an idiot I am. They both keep asking why i'm doing it and I tell me my financial opportunity line again when my boss finally goes ""No, I sat in my car crying for at least 10 minutes. 

I now get to go back in in an hour, and that's how she treated me. I have been a great employee, I always go above and beyond what is asked of me, take extra shifts, and close several times a week, but she can't appreciate that I need to be able to focus on school. 

Bonus point that I don't know how else to work in

He loved saying hello to everyone, and he was great entertainment to one of my tables. 

My table was a very friendly and jovial mother and aunt that took out about five kids with her. They were having great conversations

Well, their toddler HAD to say good-bye to everyone, and he asked,

""Can I have a hug?!""

His mother instructed him that it wasn't really okay to ask that of people, they would all love a hug.

They were in the way, they eat at separate tables, and judge each other based on...well, whatever. Or they just don't care. These ten people completely clicked with each other; they connected, they laughed, they hugged, and...

So I've been working at a brewery for a few months now and I really love it. I however can't understand what people have against craft beer. Prime example happened Friday night. It was my universities graduation this weekend, and then there were catered off menu appetizers at 8 for guests coming in and out. Grat on private banquets is 20%, but it's the only party I take that night. Regardless, I'm excited. 

6:30 rolls around and the grad comes in to set up. She lets me know that they need appetizers at 7 instead of 8 and no one is eating off the menu. First of all, there goes my money for the night.

I calmly advise that we don't serve lunch until noon on weekdays. He then proceeds to go on a rant about how he can't eat anything on the breakfast menu because and I quote "" all this shit has filthy pork meat on it that you Americans love "" which is bullshit

I think I can handle 5 tables at once

Two girls that work at my restaurant came in to sit on the patio, which I didn't mind, because we were friends. After somewhat ignoring getting their drinks (they'd understand, I had 8 tables) in favor of cashing out 3 other tables, one of them called out ""PARCHED"", in a fake whispered voice. The understanding lady loudly followed up with ""WHO GIVES A SHIT?!?!"" Most of the tables on the patio gawked, and I finished grabbing checkbooks and went inside.

I decided on my next trip out (with their drinks), she said she knew (I presume they talked when I went inside), but that she was very protective of servers, as it's how she got through her Masters and Doctorate degrees. She left me 20% and a huge smiley face on the receipt.

I should've told her that she can sit in my section any time lol.

However, they were asking if they could order appetizers, and I kept telling them I'd get to it in a minute. So I come back after making the drinks, and take their appetizer order, then a few minutes later I take their dinner order. Everything went smooth after that, except for when it came time to pay.

They were all on separate checks, I realized I DIDN'T INCLUDE GRATUITY. Their bill was close to $300, and hardly any of them tipped, even though I made an announcement that gratuity was NOT included. 

Then to top it all off, so that had to come out of my pocket since it was my fault that I didn't collect her payment. Although I should have made around $55 tip from the table, I only made $10, minus the $25...so I ended up paying $15 to serve them.

I moved to Dallas from California about 18 months ago, shadiest bar I've ever been to.  Whoopee.  Normal work days were the entire time the bar was open, so some shifts went well past 12 hours, with no breaks.  This was also a bar that allowed smokers, so that's fun.

I had already survived a table of 40-something Limbaugh fans who grabbed my boobs so hard that they still were sore, so when this guy walked in, I was ecstatic.  

He was the epitome of normal.  White polo shirt, flip-phone in a belt clip, and the most average face ever--not ugly, not attractive.  He said ""please"" and ""thank you,"" made eye-contact, smiled, and silently ate his wings, and watched the Rangers.  He never once gave me any reason to think he was anything odd

Generally, normal restaurant stuff. We might get 2-3 people coming through the door an hour, but nothing too bad. 

So on this random Monday in the middle of summer, and a huge water bottle come in and just walks past the front counter. Our front counter and kitchen line was set up near the front of the store, so you couldn't really see most the dinning room without leaving this area.

Our restaurant also had these hallways past the bathroom, we just figure he's leaving out the back, it happened all the time. But then, 3-4 minutes later, we see him walk back out the front of the store. OK, maybe he used our restroom and ignored the customer's only sign. Whatever, I'm not going to police the restroom.

But then we see the same guy Tuesday. This time

Comes in again on Wednesday. The FOH manager is in the office

Finally, and the FOH manager decides to do a casual stroll in the dinning area to see what this guy is doing. I hear some arguing, some entitlement, the FOH manager says, ""You're an idiot"" and then this guy storms out of the front of the restaurant.

All of our dishwashers are mentally handicapped. I don't have any problems with this because most of them are really polite and helpful... but this one guy makes work miserable for everyone when he's there. Whenever I or another busser brings back dish carts for him, ""We can't do anything about it since he's mentally handicapped,"" so we've had to learn to put up with his crap. Since I'm kind of used to him doing this, it's not usually a big deal. He's a jerk, whatever.

Yesterday, our manager asked that, if we have time and notice the dishwasher is behind, help him break down the dish carts. This is by no means mandatory.

Now, because the diswashwer was obviously not busy at all. Every time I went back there he was sitting down or goofing off. Well, any time I would go in the back to grab a cart, I get attitude from him because he doesn't want to do any work. I can hear strings of curses at me from under his breath, but I ignore it because he always does this.

Eventually though, leaving the dishes for him. When I would leave the dish room after having just helped him (again, not mandatory), he would yell after me stuff like, ""Thanks for nothing!""

I would just roll my eyes and ignore him, you're not good for anything!"" At this I was stunned. He had never said anything like this to me, and I knew for a fact I was the best busser in the entire restaurant (I was the only one who went above and beyond my job requirements, and all of my supervisors have already flat-out told me I'm the best worker they have).

I left the dish room kind of in shock. I didn't really know how to respond to something like that, and as I did, I got angrier and angrier. Finally, as I was taking another cart back to the dish room, I snapped. ""For your information, I work my butt off running from room to room trying to get all these tables done."" He started yelling over me, ""Yeah right,"" but I just kept going. ""If you don't believe I work my butt off doing my job

I just fucking broke down and started crying (while still trying to work). As I was returning to the floor (crying), I didn't care. I was going to get my job done and I wasn't going to help our jerk dishwashwer empty out carts anymore.

Finally, I was surprised. Our dishwasher had never been punished or anything before for the way he treated us. The one year he even bruised a girl's pelvis bone because he had thrown a cart at her way too hard, but he still got away with it. And now, here was my manager giving him an earful. She even got the building manager involved. They told me I didn't have to help him with the carts anymore and even got him to apologize to me.

TL;DR Restaurant water main pipe burst



So, we started showing up to work on Saturday and when I walked in I noticed a flood of water in the parking lot. No big deal probably the kitchen staff doing a nice clean of the fryers or something. Walking in after me is one of the newer guys, who we all love to give hell too. He also mentioned the water, and we in no uncertain terms, told him to shut up jokingly. 

But when someone took a quick break to grab water while we set up, can the toilets flush? No. Can the water run in the faucets? No. Dishwasher? Negative. We tell our manager, who can sometimes be smart, but is mostly just there...barely. She runs the coke from the fountain and proudly exclaims that, ""it works, see?"". After she tasted it did she realize it was all syrup and no water. Hilarious. Anyways, we go out back and you can see the water gushing out of the back. The higher ups show up and try to figure it out. 

We had 150ish on the books for that night, but then out of no where the owner decides we should open anyways. Right there morale drops so fast it flies past rock bottom. They send me to another one of our restaurants to get made tea from them and water. Not joking here. 

When I was leaving, they are sending another server to go buy water and coke and stuff. 

Now, left. Parties walked in, found out and walked right back out. Of course our special manager would run after them to save face and try to keep them, but how could you without running water? The higher ups told us to keep people happy and we had free reign to give out complimentary drinks and deserts to make sure it happened. Bullshit in my opinion. I personally told one table that we had no water, and the dad asked how no one could tell them that. They talked to the manager and left. Shes pulls me aside and asked why I would tell them that. I went off. I was embarrassed at this, and I made it known. The worst part is that the little girl, who was ten maybe, we can't do that(when we went to buy coke, and Im telling people we cant do certain things. this is bullshit and if you want, making snide comments

Fast forward to Monday, were here that night and entertaining guests. And you have to potty, yet we have no facilities at the time. You would either hold it and make it very uncomfortable for you, or get in the car, drive to the gas station and go, and then come back. Now thats an easy 10 minute field trip, so youve missed a course at least. Or better yet, walk in and see they have an open table. You would call your guests, and I know they said its not a problem, what have you? Those are 17 year old kids that are doing a once in a life time thing

LOL, and used up all of our water, the restaurant is currently out of water and ice. If we had just closed, repaired it, we would be fine, but now I think itll be weeks or months to completely fix it. The reputation is damaged for good now.

My four table section was thereafter filled with nothing but groups of women. All of them stayed at least two hours, definitely didn't have specials to tell you... It took them 30 minutes to even consider they had menus (see: ""oh we haven't even looked yet"" and ""we haven't seen each other in a while""), then equally as long to consider that they had a check to pay. 

Second table INSISTED I get a sample of wine from the bar for a woman who didn't even want the sample she just wanted a full glass. She ended up ordering a full glass. This table was here for two and a half hours and ate slower than my wife eating a pizza before she realized she has a gluten problem. 

Third table took an hour to order entrees (they sat with their app and menus in front of them for at least 50 minutes), unaddressed, ambiguous as to whether they wanted desert or coffee, until two and a half hours in one person orders a water.

Fourth table was just your typical irritating table- people who don't know how to project their voice over a busy restaurant and are too busy talking to each other than to listen to you repeat their order back to them. They even told me to not put sauce on a dish then complained when there wasn't sauce on it.

In short

In short, not past when everyone else has left the restaurant and you're done gossiping about whoever and whatever. Do men camp? Absolutely. But in my experience two guys will vacate the premises LONG before two chatty Cathy's will, and they won't act like you're intruding on their time when the opposite is far more true. If a restaurant is empty and you're the last one in it, you didn't win. You didn't beat the clock or anything. It's not cute. You're just that annoying person who's getting glared at by people who want to go home, people you're screwing out of time and money. An hour and a half is the longest reasonable amount of time one should spend at a table if you've ordered either an appetizer or desert. And for the love of god, please order something so I can do my job. ",,self,,

its a normal day

it takes a while for me to get to them because they can't make up their mind and other people want to order

everyone else leaves and its just them and I take their order. I decide to make small talk and ask how long they've been married.  she says ""5 years."" I'm  a little surprised
I make a few sweet comments about the situation and she went on.

""yeah

Do any of you have cringe worthy stories of being with the party harassing your server? I hope I'm not the only one...

**A bit of backstory:** These all include my mother who is in general a very sweet lady- this issue occurs most often when she confuses herself (then she very stubbornly insists she is right).

--------------------------------------------------------

**Mexican restaurant** At a Mexican restaurant I ask what kind of cheese is on the tostada. Server responds. I ask if there are any other cheese options to pick from. Server says

--------------------------------------------------------

**Steak resturant** Then there's the time at a steak resturant my mom orders a ""cobb salad"". Server informs they do not have that type of salad, but all the offered salads are good. My mom then goes on to EXPLAIN what a cobb salad is to the server. Server states she knows what salad she is referring to, and that they don't carry it. Mom gets flustered and starts demanding to see the dinner menu as she was, ""just here last week and ordered it for dinner."" As the server hesitantly walks away to grab a dinner menu (exact same items on the lunch menu, only pricier), I ask my mom when she had time to come to this resturant the week prior, as I remember her going to several OTHER places. After a bit of confusion she remembers that it was at another place she got the cobb salad...server returns with dinner menu and my mom declines to look at it and apologizes to our server for remembering another resturant but that they too should have a cobb salad.

--------------------------------------------------------

**Coffee shop** While my parents were on vacation they stopped in at a popular coffee joint for something cold as it was 100+ degrees out. My mom is not familiar with the menu items as she seldom goes- she explained to the barista she wanted somethig ""cold and tart"". She gets her drink and loves it....skip to a later date after they'd returned from vacation and I head to this same coffee joint with her (in our area of course). As she was so impressed with the drink she'd received last time she orders again in the same manner, but by that point she'd already sipped away at most of her drink and decided it wasn't so bad after all. She says she is sorry and will try to be more specific in the future but that they should obviously not have such a ""confusing"" menu.

--------------------------------------------------------

**Note:**I think it's nice she always ends up apologizing to the wait staff but I mean seriously- if you didn't fly off the handle about stuff like this then it wouldn't even be necessary!

I was in a section near the kitchen, someone in the kitchen forgot to give the back a 'low call' on bakers (for those of you not in the industry
  

My table? uh uh.  Went to their table (as we're supposed to) before hand and let him know we were a little behind on baked potatoes and when he got his food, ""But why not leave his food in the back until the baker is ready? It's only two minutes."" Two reasons: 1. It's very busy and the kitchen is crowded. Also, our kitchen supervisor was just promoted to that position, so he's on a little bit of a power kick and flips the fuck out on anyone who lets their food sit. It's understandable to want it run out right away, but he literally will cuss at servers and food runners. It gets run when it's done. No later.  2. There was no room except for under the heat lamps.

The guy gets kinda grumpy about it
He gets his meal and is reminded (and I apologize again) that it will be two minutes for his baker.  He then gets PISSED. ""Well now my food is gonna by cold by the time it gets here.  You better get it here faster. I ain't afraid to send this back."" (Right

So after word got around that I was in the office for so long, 2 weeks ago now. 

Saturday the 27th, sitting the whole time while bossing everyone around. Being rude to the manager. The other 2 closers called her out on her rudeness, and she basically lost it and walked out at midnight. The rest of us closed at 4 am with no issues.  I guess some things happened with the manager and other servers through out the evening because Sunday my phone went nuts with coworkers wanting support to go talk to the owner. Sunday afternoon 5 of us met at the restaurant, went into the office and spoke to the owner. He let us all tell everything that happened for 20 minutes before telling us he reviewed the cameras and had fired the girl at 9am. Her girlfriend/manager was suspended. 

We all had to write statements to send to corporate, she still feels like the victim and is hurt that 'we would all turn on her so fast.' Consensus is that she can act like a professional now that she isn't being manipulated constantly. The biggest bonus is money is definitely being distributed much more evenly now, all the servers are rotating party tables, and we are staying consistently within 15 dollars of each other in tips. Last night I made over 200 dollars, its only the second time ever at that restaurant, and it was a night that girl was off too.

So my last story was well received so I thought I would throw another one out there for you guy and gals.

Backstory: I was working as a waiter in a pretty typical restaurant. We had our entryway in the middle and the north side of the restaurant was smoking and the south side non-smoking. On this particular day though

We were pretty busy, it was awhile ago, but I'll do my best to stay accurate) of the following 3 encounters with these people (Man = Chris and Woman = Jennie):

**First Encounter**

Me: Hi

Chris: Yup.

Me: Perfect

Jennie: Non-smoking.

Me: Sure, but I can put your name on our list.

Jennie: [Starting to come across a bit bitchy] Are you kidding? Is there any way we can be seated now?

Me: Sure

(They discuss this for a moment before): Chris: Yeah

Me: No worries

I proceed to go through the normal spiel and return to my counter.

**Second encounter**

Jennie: Excuse me

Me: [Excusing myself from the conversation I was having with a regular] Yes ma'am

Jennie: It reeks by our table.

Me [Genuinely concerned] I'm terribly sorry. Would you like me to come check on what it might be?

Jennie: [Huffy, gesticulating with right hand] I know what it is. It reeks of cigarettes.

Me: [Holding back bewildered amusement] Well

Jennie: But it smells really strongly of cigarettes!

Me: Ma'am

Jennie: It reeks and there is smoke everywhere.

It's at this point that I look over to check the area and make sure there's not a fire or something. There was one person smoking. In the smoking section. ONE. I get if you are aggravated by smoke it being a problem

Me: I'll tell you what

I usually wouldn't have offered this with a pretty full house as they were already taking up a table. Typically I would have told them they would have to come back up front and wait then

Jennie: Ugh

After about 10 minutes we get them over to a non-smoking table and we all move on with our days

**Third Interaction**

Chris: Excuse me?

I had no one up front at this point and turn my attention to him.

Me: Yes sir

Chris: [Gesturing toward his table] Yeah

Me: [After looking where he pointed and understanding the situation more fully] Is 
there something that I can do? Would you like me to have it re-made? Have you spoken to your waiter? (I was really confused as to why they were coming to me with a food related issue.

Chris: I don't know where he is. She says it smells like smoke.

Me: Is it possible that they smell is still lingering in her nose after being in the smoking section?

Chris: [Looking downtrodden] ...yeah.

Me: Okay... um...

Chris: Look

I am left at this point to assume he wanted her to think he got it for free and just avoid the fight.

Me: Um... sure...

I called over his waiter

Jennie: What are you doing?

Chris: I'm paying so we can leave.

Jennie: Are you fucking kidding?!

That actually caught me off-guard as even though she had been a horrible patron she didn't look like the ""swearing in public"" type.

Chris: Calm down

Jennie: No! You shouldn't pay for this fucking shit! (Quite the mouth on her in my memory) It smelled and tasted like crap!

I was getting ready to start damage control when -

Chris: Shut the fuck up! Jesus. Screw this. [To me] Have a good day man. Sorry about her.

He then took her by the arm and walked out.

I was never more awed/ecstatic about a customers response.

We weren't very busy last night and by the time I got cut I only had 3 tables

Table 1 was a father and his two little girls. He was telling me how his wife was sick at the hotel room (and he got food to go for her) and his daughters were little angels the whole time. In general they were just really nice and polite

Table 2 was a family; adult son, just have grandma pick one out. This woman was so incredibly happy about this and teared up telling me how much it meant to her, that this wasn't what they had planned at all and how upset she was. I just told her she just had to roll with the punches. It was really nice that such a small thing made a difference and that I could help them. They really appreciated it and grandma had a great time.

Last but definitely not least, and having never been there before were asking a lot of questions and having a good time. The boy had ordered a root beer and was asking me all about it (we make our own root beer). At one point during the meal he asks me about 5 gallon kegs and how long the root beer would stay fizzy and other stuff. I knew they were traveling so I let them know that they would have to return the keg within the month and he was pretty disappointed. Let it be noted that this is a 10 yr old boy, and he was wanting FIVE GALLONS of root beer! He was going hard! He ended up buying a couple 64 oz jugs of it.

I stepped behind the bar and oh holy shit.  The floor was about 3 inches higher than it should have been as it probably hadn't been cleaned since the bar opened in the 70s. When I tried pouring a draft just to check, half-inch lumps of mouldy, yeasty ~~goodness~~ fucking disgusting grossness poured into each beer. (As an aside, I 86'd draft and refused to serve it til he had a pro come clean the taps. He tried to do it himself, but I stood firm.) Then I checked out the stock.

We had I think 8 different types of bottled beer - but we only had about 3 bottles of each! I even sent a pic to my friend bemoaning 'What am I supposed to *sell*?' I've worked in working class 'hoods before - I *am* working class - and people don't have 2/3 beers and leave - they have 9+. And they are attached to their brand. If you run out of Bud they're not going to switch to Coors. They'll leave

Liquor. Holy fuck.  I think everyone in this sub knows what a [stocked bar looks like.](http://onemansblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/liquor-shelf-in-bar.jpg) I can't find a pic to illustrate but imagine four fifths of those gone and tumbleweed blowing in the empty spaces. What we did have was well or, but this was a predominantly white neighbourhood, and white people don't drink Alize.) I found a flashlight and checked the bottles... uggggggghhhhhhh. Upwards of ten fruit flies in every syrupy/brown liquor bottle. More 86'ing.  I couldn't ditch them (yet) as I'd been there around 15 minutes, and boss man was gone.

Okay

* So concerned about his bottom line he mused on straning the fruit flies rather than waste the bottles. NO. Also phone service got cut off and he couldn't pay for a few days. RELEVANT.

* *Maybe* 3 customers a day spending about ten bucks each. My shift pay (which was actually generous) was often more than the ring. That's why I stayed for a couple of weeks

* I told him close for a week, re-open. He couldn't...here's where the 'mafia' come in...


Some guy owed him $xx000 from his other business, how about I give you my bar instead?' WTF!?! After he took over, guy decided the bar was worth xx000+(some amount) and started harassing boss to pay back his *debt*.

A stereotypical guido goon came in late one night and asked for his 30%. I boggled and he walked behind the bar, I'm new and we haven't met. I'm sure you appreciate I can't give money to *anyone*. If you call (boss man) and put me on the phone, I will if he says so.'

He backed up a bit and told me not to be scared in that Joe fucking Pesci way that means you should be fucking terrified. Called my boss. And says -

* I'm very disappointed in you. And my father - his heart hurts.

* We thought you were a friend of ours.

* You know I'm going 'out of town' in 3 weeks. I'm just looking out for my father.

* Just because I won't be here

* **So what am I supposed to take 30% of? The fucking bartender?**

Right after saying that he looks me in the eye and again says not to be scared of him. Still on the phone telling boss how disappointed his father is and he needs to fix it before his three years 'out of town'. I was WAY to scared to call the cops but slipped my cell in my pocket and asked him to use the bathroom. Sent a desperate - no reception - text to a friend - 'Come here; lunatic; u don't know me'. A few minutes later scary guy is still on phone

I want to tell you my friend arrived with 100 SAS guys, I could HEAR his snorts and sniffles. Ordered a rum and coke, and left...promising he or his friend A would see me soon to pick up.

I actually stayed til close that night and worked two more days 'til I realized I couldn't do it anymore. I'm an idiot.

One afternoon I'm standing behind the register looking over the floor to see if any of my tables needed anything (only had 2 or 3 tables

I say sure thing. While I'm putting the order in I overhear the tall loud one saying ""Okay they're $2.25 each and I got two

While I'm writing down the order the tall loud one says (yelled) ""OH SO THEY'LL HIRE GUYS BUT THEY WON'T HIRE BLACK PEOPLE? I'M NOT RACIST BUT...""

I mutter ""I have nothing to do with that sorry...""
TLO (Tall loud one): OH I KNOW BUT STILL I DON'T GET IT

all the while the short one is just standing there smiling and laughing to herself

I ask them if they want to pay separately and they say yes.

It comes to 6 something each

Anyway

I tell them ""yep they have""

They haven't

Anyway

Her friend throws down 5 to cover her pizza. 

I turn around to get the first 2 slices and while I was turned around I hear TLO say ""I SHOULD HAVE JUST TAKEN IT OUT OF HIS TIP JAR HE WOULDN'T HAVE NOTICED HAHAHA""

Right.

Anyway I give the first two slices then about 20 seconds later the second ones come out. She says ""WHICH ONES ARE THE HOT ONES HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHICH ONES ARE THE HOT ONES!?!""

I say ""I would guess these ones **I hand them to her** as they took longer to come out""

You could see the struggle on her face to follow the logic

I really didn't know which ones were the hot ones

Anyway

Then she yells ""OH I ALSO WANT SOME FREE BLEU CHEESE""

First of all

I ring them up for that and it's a dollar more. Her quietly laughing friend pays for it.

At this point food has come up for one of my tables who isn't obnoxious

I kept an eye on them to make sure they didn't steal from my tip jar as they left their garbage on the counter and stormed out.

I know this may sound like something minor

Anyway

Apparently they were upset before they sat down because they were promised patio seating but didn't get it, they were upset that they weren't sat with a woman or a gay guy, *""Like we normally are""*!

I was visiting another city with my sister on my one day off and was called and texted by management asking to come back early to work that night. I texted a coworker who I thought was a friend to see if it was really going to be that busy. Management continued to ask me to come in even though I said no. They even tried to bribe me. It go to the point where I just began ignoring them. 

The next day I asked the same coworker how the night went and then went off on a bit of a rant about how I was harassed and how they need to hire more people. She agreed with me and ranted a bit herself. Little did I know she was actually just telling me what I wanted to hear so that she could go and report what I said to management.

The head manager came up to speak with me while I was in the middle of serving tables. She did not pull me aside or wait till after my shift. She said she was cutting my shifts down to 3 shifts a week and that if I have an issue to speak to her and not to my coworkers.

Let me first say that I will always own up to a bad table, when I first saw this 'tip', I was honestly too busy to look in my books from each table and see who tipped what, so I just looked at the pieces of hardware (not mentally noting the pennies) as interesting random items left behind, especially from the awkward family I had just waited on at that table. 

I ran into my boss first, (weird, but his cell phone number is on the front door next to ""general manager""), saying that I took ""forever"" to greet them, I was talking to the host the whole time, and they had to wait on refills ""forever"".

To make a long story short....I was triple sat, closed out tables, and printed checks. Their table also all had bar drinks that were coming from our overly busy bar, but you best believe their water glasses were always full and their food was prompt. We had a couple short funny conversations that went well, they smiled, I made good suggestions and helped them out when ordering, got them to go drinks and other things I really didn't have to do.....When I learned the truth behind the screws it *almost* got to me.

When you bring the mean table their food, and say in the creepiest way possible, ""Enjoy your food..""

They will almost always think you did something to it, every time a manager comes over, the customer cannot come up with one legitimate reason as to why they don't want their food, and will look stupid.  The manager then thinks they're an idiot, and will wave off any further complaints from them.  Since no person or camera can prove their case, you're in the clear.

I was a customer and witnessed this incident happen right in front of me yesterday and I thought I'd share. 

Just a few things you need to know: This all happened in a heavily-accented redneck Acadian French, it's in a u-shape with a staircase in the middle that leads to the bathroom upstairs, the coat room and the kitchen being on either side of it. Also, there are WAY too many ignorant people like this man around my home town. 

As I said, a teenage daughter that is clearly trying to be classier than her dad, and this tattooed mountain of a dad. 

They walk in and immediately I see that this mass of masculinity is clearly not well versed in the concept of sit-down restaurants. His wife and teen daughter sit down and he's just walking around, in his words. He meandered around the cash, peeked at the kitchen, and was walking WAY too close to the tables, triggering scared looks from other customers. He was super beefed up, and his face was red with effort, I'm guessing his brain had trouble processing the fact that this wasn't fast food. He then tries to enter the kitchen to go pee. I know this because I overhear him muttering ""....bathroom..."" and grunting. He tries to enter a closet, leading to the washrooms. Eventually

The waitress arrives, but he was speaking rather loudly. I'm not too sure of all of what was said, but this is the gist of it:

Fowl Father: This menu's full of pussy food!

Meek Mother: Oh...look at that

Daring Daughter: Yeah dad! You can have this, right?

FF: I'LL EAT WHAT I WANT

DD: Dad...

FF: THERE AREN'T ANY HAMBURGERS? WHY AREN'T THERE ANY?

FF: WELL I'M LEAVING. ARE YOU COMIN' WIT ME OR NOT?

They both fell silent. I didn't dare look around. Then I heard him getting up.

FF: WELL?!?! ARE YOU COMING OR NOT??

I looked over as he walked through the door, and all she said was: ""Well, if he's not happy, there's a Mc Donald's on the other side of town"".

 A few memorable events:

I seat an older man, everyone is happy, cool.  About 15 minutes later, he comes up to the host stand and the following exchange happens:

*boy comes up

*my heart melts* ""Of course!  You only need one pack?""

*he ponders deeply for about 15 seconds, one is good.""

*hand him the crayons

*takes them* ""Thank you!"" *goes back to his table*

This was a sign of the things to come.  Around 6:00 pm, and had a good sense of humor.  I told them it was corporate policy that I couldn't seat them until at least half of their party was there.  The girl was very understanding and I got her seated as quickly as possible.  The party was very clean and tipped well.

The cherry on top was around seven, and told me she was pregnant.  I am not shitting you when I tell you, their kids were the BEST KIDS I'VE SEEN IN A REALLY LONG TIME.  Obedient, clean, polite, the whole nine yards.  I even went up to them when they were done and complimented their parenting skills.

Just to give a little background on the restaurant I work for it's a chain restaurant that's kind of like a conglomerate of a few different restaurants. I also live in Indiana and we have laws against comping alcohol. 
So anyways


I get sat a 5-top at one of my booths there's mom, and (what I'm guessing is) a 2 and 4 year old. Well they all order waters and some alcohol so as I'm walking away to get their drinks, mom stops me and demands that I bring crackers or bread over to appease the children (who are crawling all over my booth) and I tell her that our kids meals come with carrots and ranch so I'll bring that right over with the drinks. So anyways it's all typical picky family with ill behaved children until everyone gets their food (at this point mom is on her 2nd Absolute Red Bull) Well mom and grandma ordered medium cooked steaks that come with two sides...well those are cold. Dad's meatloaf is cold as well but he's just going to eat it though ""I'm not happy with it"" so I bring the steaks to the back and my manager has me re-ring them for steak count and goes and talks to them. He comes back and tells me the dad has called his kitchen ""shit."" I go back over there to tell them that their new food will be right up and against my better judgement bring mom her 3rd Absolute and Red Bull of the night. I bring out their food and all are happy (except now the little girl is dumping out my sugar caddy and salt and pepper shakers and mom and dad are too drunk to care) until they get the check. Mom and dad are to the point of slurring words so of course reading that check is going to be confusing, so I go over to them and they proceed to ask me to explain the discounts so I tell them that it's illegal in Indiana to comp alcohol, but that my manager had voided one drink each from mom and dad and then proceed to explain that I had to re-ring in the steaks so that we can keep track, in which case very drunk mom screams ""WE FUCKIN KNOW THAT."" Either way they can't wrap their head around why there bill was $110 and is now $69 and why all of these food items are popping up on their bill because the manager said they were comped. This is when dad starts screaming at me. 


Dad: I WANT A BILL THAT SAYS WHAT IT IS I'M PAYING FOR AND THAT'S IT. YOUR MANAGER SAID HE'D COMP ALL OF THE FOOD AND TAKE OF A COUPLE OF DRINKS. 


Me: Sir


Dad: WELL YOUR MANAGERS A FUCKIN LIAR AND A FUCKIN PIECE OF SHIT!! 
I then proceed to grab the bill and as nicely as I can explain to them that I'm going to send my manager over to explain the bill.

So yesterday I worked the opening shift

The other waitress showed up and we got a nice little Monday lunch rush. I was pretty busy but I knew the guys liked to hang out so I didn't worry about them much, and a lot of people just want a couple pita). I said sure, ordered it up, jotted it down on my ticket with a 25 cent charge, the usual price for a single extra pita. 

Yadda yadda, give it back, tell them to have an awesome day, all is well. 

**UNTIL** they're leaving and I overhear the guy who asked me for the pita berating the **other waitress** because I ""charged him 75 cents for a pita and it's ridiculous and that pita was supposed to come with his meal and he's not coming back."" This guy is a regular who comes in with this group practically weekly. I go right over and ask what's up and he spouts the same thing at me. I politely explain that it was actually only 25 cents, and **if he'd brought it to my attention when he saw the bill I would have taken it off immediately.** Bear in mind that this is only 25 cents we're talking about, but this guy is freaking out like I spit on his omelet. He doesn't want to hear anything I'm saying and keeps insisting that he's never coming back.

The happy ending is that one of the nice guys left something behind and called about it later; I happened to pick up

But seriously, but even so. And if you see something on the ticket and think ""wait, that doesn't look right,"" FLAG ME DOWN AND ASK ME ABOUT IT. I was always available to them and would have corrected the error without batting an eye and it wouldn't have been an issue at all.

""I'm going to sell this whole fucking table Louie Trey.""

Dinner service ended and he passed out dessert and cocktail menus

Before he could even walk away and allow them a moment to ponder, and said the words he had anticipated his entire server life:

""BRING US 12 SHOTS OF LOUIE TREY!""

My buddy was able to contain his excitement just long enough to reply ""Of course"" so cool that you'd have though the fucker just asked for an extra bev nap.  He quickly retreated to the POS and opened up the bar screen and began to press a button he had never pressed before.

Everyone turns and looks at the manager.  He takes a beat that feels like an hour, then pulls a bottle of Remy XO off the shelf.  A fine cognac at $30 a glass, but not Louis XIII.  But, desperate times call for desperate measures, so...he pours in 4 shots of XO and redistributes the cognac onto the 12 glasses.  Not a word was spoken.

He watches the host picks up the glass, ""Whoa, whoa, don't drink this!  This isn't right.""  He shoots his eyes to my server friend and waves him over vigorously.  Oh, Jesus...

The guest: ""What is this?""

Server: ""Um

Guest: ""Louie Trey?  What the hell is Louie Trey?""

""Get. Those. Drinks. Off. The. Table.  NOW!""

Suddenly it clicks in--these folks are about to down $3000 in product they didn't want and won't pay for.  The server quickly rushes back to the table, it's not like you can throw it out, right?

The bartender, and pours out the 12 shots of 43.

1369198498.0,1etehw,A tale from your customer.,Dontleave,91,14,44,"Hello everybody! Long time reader (and eater) first time poster here.  I wanted to share an experience I had today when I went to a local Hibachi restaurant for half price night. 

I was with three of my friends and we had a server who seemed pretty average

She came over and apologized for forgetting about us (which she didn't really) and said she had a really bad night and that a group of 4 teenagers had done the ole dine n dash leaving her to foot a $150 bill. She said she didn't get a good look at them and she has to pay the restaurant the whole bill herself and that she would probably end up in the negative for the night. First of all

Anyway, decided I would be generous, as I was planning on spending $50 that night anyway, so I left her a $50 bill and told her it was all set and that I hoped her night got better. She came back and said that I didn't have to do that, I insisted and she said she was going to cry, which she kind of did for all of 2 seconds.

So there I am feeling good

It was at that time that my friend happened to see a buddy of his working as busser (he also is a bartender but not tonight) and he asks him about the situation. Well his buddy said that she did have a really slow night and hadnt made a lot of tips. She also had a reservation of 8 and only 4 showed up so she lost out on that but she never got walked out on.

So now I feel that I got scammed and I guess I just wanted to share my experience with you. Do you guys as insiders feel like what she did was okay? Should I call the business tomorrow or should I give her the benefit of the doubt? I mean if what she said was true then I feel fine leaving a nearly 100% tip as I genuinely felt bad for her

Edit: TL;DR: Waitress told us she got walked out on and has to pay $150 to the owners

EDIT2: Okay guys here's an update: I just called and talked to a ""manager"" (probably an assist manager or something) who said that she absolutely lied to me and that she absolutely did not have a table walk out on her and in no way owed them $150 (which I mean how can 4 teenagers spend that much on half price night anyway?).

So, great boss, good drinks. We not only handled the usual variations of espresso but smoothies among other things, alternating from that to going on the cashier post and chatting it up with customers make it all the better. It was overall a really great place and working there since it opened was a joy!

... And then the place gets famous

Now, we have a tendency to deal with 'that guy'. You know, the pretentious, trying-to-hard-to-be-eloquent-and-artsy type people.

I have two instances of that during my course of work.

The first, fedora, shades he never seems to take off, skinny jeans, and checkered shirt, think hipster-type people. We greet him warmly with our usual ""welcome!"" and the man *nods* off, not even so much of a smile back. A bit of a pet peeve of mine but fine

A good colleague and personal friend of mine manned the cashier

So

**Iced Cappuccinos are either non-existent

This is because the *foam* which cappuccino drinkers love so much has to be made apart from the cold milk that's used in the first place

Usually we're confronted with this order by customers and we politely tell them either how bad the drink is and/or suggest an iced caffe latte instead. 

This man scoffs and shouts ""Really!? No, I'll do it,"".

My friend knew our boss was lurking around and it's really not right of us to stray from the menu

Our boss then walks up to me, texture when drinking it because it's been pulled before. He then says ""Go ahead, froth it."" And froth it I did.

So we then served the iced cappuccino to the man, requesting to change it to a caffe latte. We smiled back and we told him ""Sorry sir, you might need to pay for that,"" and he did, face red and suddenly very quiet. Our team laughed about it for the longest time during after hours.

I make 3.25 per hour plus tips. On weekends we typically have a server and a phone person for carryout and deliveries. The server clocks in at 3.25

I've been having some issues with my coworker, so she is frequently put on phones. However she will try to steal tables when the server's back is turned as much as possible, even though she is making minimum wage and should not be getting tips. She also will do little tiny things for my tables, without me asking for or needing her help, and then demand half of my tip. She will clean my tables as soon as they leave, again without me asking, and there is never a tip left on those tables.

Awhile back I had a regular come in who usually leaves a generous tip. She wiped the table

We have had many more issues with her as well. She stands around talking her entire shift
She has had multiple complaints from customers about everything to messing up orders to having a rude tone. If she is taking a phone order and a dine in customer walks in

I am tired of nothing being done about these issues. I have talked her. At first I was very polite, and will not discipline her employees. I talked to her about these issues, and she said Sandy must be caught stealing before she can be terminated. I understand this, but are the rest of these issues not something she should be disciplined over? She has had at least six customer complaints that I know of, and she hasn't even worked there for a year. I do not know what to do anymore, I have talked to management and her as well. The last time she tried this with me, I made it no way unclear that she is not to take my tables, or even speak to my customers and I will not be giving her any part of my tips because of these problems.

The other night I went to a famous all-night diner in my city with some friends for some delicious hippie hash and were faced with a bunch of high schoolers fresh out of their prom. There was one waitress and one cook and they looked annoyed as hell. For the most part the kids left them alone...until three others walked in. I was outside having a smoke with a friend and when we came back in these fuckers were sitting in our seats, se hastily made her retreat when I hissed ""fucking MOVE"" in her ear.

The three teens decided they wanted to make an order. The waitress told them three times they needed to do it at the register but they kept interrupting her to tell her what they wanted. It was two AM and I had enough of this bullshit. I literally shouted at them. ""OVER THERE. SHE SAID OVER THERE. ORDER THERE."" They stared at me and the guy hastily moved to the register to order. I went for another smoke (one thing I need to work on is my excessive smoking...damn you kitchen work for introducing me to sweet sweet tobacco) and the two teen girls came out to illegally smoke, only to hear them laugh again. They came back in and decided suddenly to pick at their boxed up food at the counter. I exchanged looks with our waitress and she looked like she honestly hated her life right then. She wanted these skanks out but couldn't say anything. So I did. I exploded.

I can't remember exactly what I said, never calling hard working people cunts in their own restaurants, and getting out before I peed on everything they loved. Those bitches fled, and the waitress gave me my meal for free. So I tipped her what the meal would've cost and fifty percent because fuck prom.

How corporate can afford this is beyond me

I arrive to a madhouse, of all nights, we were not working in sections. (WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS?!?) so it was even more hectic than it needed to be, with servers being sat all over the dining room. But I digress.

Since i am sort of new, leaving us with no mustard, on a freakin' WEDNESDAY. (Typical of day shift, but not the point here)

Right away

I go to greet the older gentleman who is dining alone. Usually

Right away we were off to a bad start by his body language and lack of eye contact at first. I tried to be as cheerful as possible and treat him as I would any customer.

""Hello sir

He barked out ""Coffee

""No problem sir

""I just sat down! Jeez! An this table's still wet!"" ( points to slightly damp table that was cleaned specifically for him because he 'always sits here')

"" I'm sorry I will dry it for you as soon as I can.""

Then I go to get my drink orders for my other tables to save me a trip or two. Now, a mug, a small glass of water, compote full of little liquid creamer packs, and of course, a straw. Add a few other coffee orders to that, plus other drinks; and that small tray can get really heavy. Plus we have to pour their coffee into their cup while its still on the tray. 

I must have miscounted my mugs or something, and water, apologize, and tell him I will return with his mug. ( of course I didn't forget to dry his table) he grumbled grouchily a little, but otherwise no complaints. I come back a few minutes later to take his order. He could not be more condescending if he tried. He was telling me slowly as if I were stupid, and made all these frivolous alterations to his simple order. When I asked him if I could get anything else for him, he shouted ""yeah, I apologize. It totally slipped my mind while I was running around for my other tables. I then ask him if he would like any condiments

""Whaddya mean you don't have any?""

"" I'm sorry

""Unbelievable! Go check the back or something!""

"" I will check one more time sir
He grumbled more

Later, but we were definitely out.

""Ridiculous! How could you be out! Can't you just walk across the street to (insert name of mega brand superstore) and get some for me?""

I just kind of held back a chuckle of irritated disbelief and looked around at our VERY busy restaurant.

""I'm sorry sir

""Sure you can! It's right there!""

""Sir if you haven't noticed

""Unbelievable!"" More grumbling.

At this point, you can leave now"" (waves hand dismissively) 

I left him to eat in peace for the remainder of his meal as it was clear he wanted nothing to do with me.

Finally, well it's Wednesday."" And then he left with his damn free piece of pie.

In addition to the cameras, we employ a private security “detail” consisting of ex-cops. On the weekends, we’ll have one upstairs and another downstairs, generally walking around and talking to everyone from management to customers. As our boss is counting money, he notices someone upstairs, stashing away a bottle of liquor under his shirt. “Oh hell no”


Dumbass, talking to friends. Their conversation goes like this:


**Mike**: “So… what do you think you’re doing?

1359268257.0,17cx8r,My Favorite Worst Customers.,misswigit,86,15,16,"A preface:
I swear on my Reddit account this story is true. I couldn't make this up, I often think back to our encounters and have a good belly laugh. Of all restaurant guests I've ever served, these were the cream of the crop.

Context:
I worked at a single-location greasy spoon diner in a small town while I was in school. I had been there at least 6 months at my first encounter with these people

My favorite worst customers were semi-regulars at the diner. The blew in with the winter wind one day, and they sat themselves in a secluded booth about an hour before closing on a Friday. I have a soft spot for the older and wiser, so seeing two obviously senior citizens out so late warmed my heart. Thinking they'd just stopped in for a milkshake or a piece of pie, I volunteered to serve them. We only had a few other tables in the restaurant at that time, and I knew the other server was eager to leave for the night.

I approached the table with menus, and silverware, and greeted them. Before I could ask any questions, the man interjected ""I don't need a straw, I drink my water like a cowboy!"" I asked if they would like anything to drink, but they just opened their menus and started poring over them, noses nearly touching the pages. I quickly deduced that they were hard of hearing, I excused myself by saying I'd give them a minute to look things over. Calling attention to myself was my first mistake.

We'll refer to these customers as Jerry and Lil' Mama. Jerry turns to me and shouts ""what have you got that's easy to chew?"" Surprised by the unusual request, so maybe pancakes or eggs."" Every time I opened my mouth after that moment, it was interrupted by Lil' Mama shouting ""JERRY! WHAT'S SHE SAYIN'?"" Jerry made a point of ignoring her, which made her all the more determined to be heard. Jerry shouted ""WE DON'T WANT BREAKFAST, WE JUST GOT NO TEETH!!!"" Jerry then began reading the menu aloud to me, audible to the whole restaurant. The other employees were kind enough to back me up on my other tables at this point. Somehow Lil' Mama deduced that Jerry was ordering, but making a show of it

After at least 5 minutes of this, this was to their benefit, as the kitchen was closing up as they were speaking. I ran back and put in their order and tried to help finish up my other customers and work on restaurant closing tasks.

Grilled cheese doesn't take long when it's the only order going into the kitchen and the staff are eager to leave, including my name. I was wearing a name tag, but I assume they couldn't read it because of their vision difficulties. ""misswigit, that's a nice name. Our daughter used to work with a misswigit across town in 1972."" Insert long, nonsensical oratory about someone who may have had my same name 40 years prior. Turns out telling them my name was my second mistake.

I eventually convinced them to eat and tried again to get back to my closing duties, sugar, crackers, many of which were on the table anyways)."" If I didn't respond immediately, they would either just yell it again or shout ""WHERE'S MISSWIGIT?!"" A few requests in, Lil' Mama asks for a takeout container for her meal, even though it looks like all she's managed to do is get chili on the hairs growing out of her chin. I thought they were leaving, but Jerry insists he's going to finish his whole meal then and there. He'd barely made a dent and it was closing time

Jerry and Lil' Mama DID take their time, because Lil' Mama sat there watching Jerry, occasionally trying to make conversation that literally fell on deaf ears, eventually falling asleep in the booth.

When Jerry went up to the cash register to pay, I just printed these dollars a minute ago."" I took their payment, thanked them, sent them on their way, and then went to clean the table. My tip was exactly one dollar, folded into a tepee and balanced over Jerry's water cup.

Jerry and Lil' Mama were sporadically regulars after that, would be about the night I had to ask them to leave and not come back (still one of the saddest and happiest moments of my serving career), but I'll save that for another time.

I have found that some of the worst restaurants are affluent suburban casual dining places. Lots of kids, because these people are mostly pretending they are important and have money to waste, or maybe they do, and they're just assholes. 

The restaurant can only be described as a clusterfuck. No expo, make your own salads, toast bread for every table, carry tickets to the kitchen, verbally call for tables to be fired, and no tickets or organization in the window. The system is set up for mistakes, and the owner claims ""it works"" when you point out flaws in the system. Also, or training. No idea of a rotation

edit: just to be clear :Every table gets bread that must be smothered in garlic and olive oil, and taken out by the server. Every entree comes with a salad that the server has to make. 


I can handle tables. I have been doing this a long time. Too long. This place...you were always in the weeds with all the shit you had to do.

Lady: No. 

Me: I'm sorry

I'm holding her empty plate that looks like it was licked clean. 

Lady: My food was cold

Me: I am very sorry ma'am. I would have fixed that for you

Lady: You know. You served it to me knowing it was cold. We don't go out to eat much

Me: Ma'am, I did not know your food was cold, and I would not knowingly serve anything that would make someone unhappy. There is no way for me to know if the food is cold unless you tell me. I asked you multiple times if everything was okay, and you said everything was fine.

Lady: Don't lie to me. You knew it was cold

( For the record the plates are usually pretty toasty. They come out of the dishwasher hot

Me: Ma'am, and the only way I have to ascertain the temperature of your food, is what you tell me. I will not touch your food to see if it is warm, I have to go on what the kitchen gives me, and you. 

Lady: Wrong. You have ruined mine

I just walked away. Presented the check

I see lady using her crayons, and I'm about to lose it. Doesn't leave it. Thank you for small things.

Get my checkout in

I proceeded to get chewed out for cold food I had no control over

This happened way back in 2008

I was working my first ever waitressing job at a small but popular place in a small but popular tourist town. It was a fairly quiet evening, highly competent girl we'll call Jen.

Jen got sat with a 4 top. Three of them I remember next to nothing about; just unremarkable

He didn't LOOK that weird. Like his friends, average looking. On the tall side of average height, dark hair. He just had slightly bulging eyes that didn't seem to blink very much, and an expression of total amazement with everything he saw. We'll call him ET.

Jen was a very friendly, maybe a question about the menu. ET, however, seemed amazed and delighted that this young lady had approached HIS table and introduced herself! ""Hi, Jen!!! Wow!!!!"" said ET. 

His friends began to help guide him through the process of choosing a drink and reading the menu. He seemed utterly incredulous. Now, and aside from the strangeness, was a delight to behold; who am I to rain on someone's parade of childlike wonder? 

After ET settled on a steak dish and his table was happily enjoying their appetizers, that he was an alien from outer space disguised as a human. We had a good chuckle about it, but not at ET's expense - we found him delightful.

(I should also mention that there was no indication that he was in any way mentally handicapped

So ET's table's food comes out

Suddenly there's a commotion. It's coming from, his eyes bulging out even further. One of his friends realizes what's happening - ""Oh my god, he's choking!""

Jen, tells ET to stand up, gets behind him and performs a beautiful Heimlich maneuver. PTOO! ET ejects a hunk of unchewed steak the size of a baby's fist and starts taking deep, gasping gulps of air. 

""I was choking!!!"" he says

Jen got the round of applause and rock star treatment she deserved from the other diners

And apologizes for the wall of text that follows.


Around the second week of June is when we really start getting into the swing of things. The shore town starts getting busy, riding a bike up or walking.


One hot day in July, two couples out to dinner, came in. I’d say they were around their late 40s, early 50s. Couple A featured Salt and Pepper, a man with the definition of Salt and Pepper hair, and a woman, Peggy (her hair reminded me of the wife from Married… With Children). Couple B featured Stocky (wasn’t hefty, and his woman companion Nancy (dunno, what harm can they do?


The waitress goes over to do the standard introduction and take their drink order. Beers for the men, but keep an eye on them.” The waitress returns with the drinks, giving the table another minute with the menu. The minute passes and before the couples order food, they want more drinks, Margaritas this time. Still no water needed. The bartender notices this and places the table under a temporary flag, wanting to see how they handle two rounds of drinks before serving them any more afterwards. Personally, I don’t know what tipped him off: The fact they were one drink away from being completely gone or the loud, and finally gets the food order.


Now, a pound of crab legs, and an assortment of shrimp, mussels and clams, all raw. The market price for it all? $80 per platter. This particular table ordered two of them, one for each couple. The dollar signs appeared in the waitress’ eyes when she came to the back area. Hot damn, she was gonna get a huge tip from this, 20% would be a $45 (before tip-out and cash drop) tip. However, and they were gone


The waitress took the drink order, our manager. Mike couldn’t be found, but the other manager, Colleen, was available. Colleen stood at a corner of the restaurant in sight of the table, and watched them for a bit, before Mike reappeared. Mike talked to Colleen


**Mike:** ""Hey folks

**S&amp;P:** ""Good… good. Hey, we’re just parched, (S&amp;P lets out a drunken laugh), don’t worry.""

**M:** ""Well

Nancy separates her finger and thumb about an inch apart from each other. “Only a little”

**M:** ""Ah-ha… well, we do have to cut you off from the booze. We’ll gladly still serve you, however, we cannot server you anything other than water or some other beverage. Also, we would like you to keep it down, as a few customers have come over to me about your loudness.""


Stocky, the least impaired, promised to keep the group in line. This lasted all of exactly 2 minutes, I kept track. S&amp;P starts complaining how this place “used to be so much better. Locals were treated with respect. I mean, we’re locals, we shouldn’t have any limits.” The waitress headed back over with the 2 Mega Seafood Platters, placing them on the table, who if I remember stories about him, we’re staying at a motel


To wrap this all up, essentially wanted to get them the hell out. The Platters, relatively untouched, were voided off the final check, knocking the bill from a whopping $230 to the total of the drinks, $66. The waitress received a $2 tip. In the end, management decided that while the drunks should have paid for all the food and have been promptly escorted afterwards, I looked at the clock. It just turned 11 PM.

As the manager on duty started trying to get the computers back on track (this had obviously never happened to her before), one of the experienced servers quickly devised a plan for giving orders to the cooks and writing up tickets. Bless her heart, seriously. Food took a long time, orders got mixed up, and for a while we could only take cash, my manager, but during a big dinner rush

Once everything was all caught up, and organized, we went back to functioning like it was a regular Monday night (however, we were a little sweatier than usual).

Many years ago, dad and two children around seven to nine years of age. Into my section danced a woman, but not before she'd done a twirl or two past the buffet (we had both buffet or table service options) and asked the chef if she could speak to a pork chop. She was a wild hippie child, wearing a sparkly cheesecloth skirt and top and sandals, an outfit that passed our dress code, but only just. The outfit was semi-transparent, had no pockets, something I didn't immediately notice as it was not yet relevant. After reading the menu several times, she apologized to each one before she ate it and did another dance circuit of her table between each slurping down of oyster. I cleared the table as soon as she was done and bought out the salad as fast as I could. She sat and ate, lifted her skirt

I shot up to the desk to call security, the two old ladies chattered on, oblivious, and one of our waitresses, walking by on her way to the bar, saw what was going on and promptly fainted. None of these things fazed our heroine.

Security arrived and I told them who, err, finished, but the old ladies had noticed by this time, the fainted waitress was back on her feet so my tale of sexual adventures with poultry was corroborated. She was removed from the premises after her name and address was taken as she had no money to pay for her meal (no purse or pockets, remember?) and I wandered over to the now empty table to clear it, sanitize it mightily

I had been working at this restaurant for about 6 months, ""I'm so sorry about table 73. It was your turn..."" On my way to greet the table, every server I passed groaned and whispered, ""I'm so sorry."" One server even said to me, ""It's a good thing you're white.""

There I am, a newbie server, much less give my corporate spiel about our Royalty Program (which is completely free and easy to sign up for, since that's all we have on the line. Also

So I take a coffee mug, and serve the coffee, regular-sized DC, and a glass of water to the table. The man puts his hand up before I even put his glass down and says, ""I know for a fact you have larger glasses than that. Bring me a larger glass."" Only at this point do I realize he REALLY wanted his DC in a large mug from the bar (there is one regular who comes in about 4 times a week that we serve soda to in a large stein. He is awesome. Last Christmas our bartenders all pitched in to buy him a stein with his name engraved into it that we keep behind the bar. Other than that, sodas go in a pint glass). Ok. I go to the bartender, who is in the weeds as usual, the woman's ""hot fresh coffee"" that I had dropped off earlier has gotten cold. I get yelled at

I put their order in, deport them all"". I made awkward eye contact with the offended guest, who tipped me well and left quickly. At one point I apologized to another table for not refilling their drinks quickly enough and they responded, ""it's ok. I see you have your hands full"", alluding to the asshole. When table 73's food was ready, I asked a black co-worker to run it for me (this table was apparently notorious for using the n-word). She was more than happy to, and responded to their scowls with the biggest smile I've ever seen.  

As you can imagine, but he demanded to speak to a manager. I had been updating my GM about this table all night, so she knew things were not going well. The man complained to her that his check was more than it usually was. She pointed out to him that his check was $3.99 more than it usually was because he had ordered a $3.99 shake. He bitched to her for, no joke, 11 minutes because ""I come here every week and never pay this much, and besides, the service is always sub-par"". Basically, I LOVE my GM).

One of them decided to get an attitude with me and ""reminded"" me that they had actually asked for 4 baskets of fries. My response? ""Oh, by all means, I'll ring up 4 baskets."" He tried to apologize after I brought them their check. 

-the white woman who complained to my manager that I was racist and gave them bad service because her daughter was mixed race.

1366727563.0,1cxqtq,Discretionary Service Charge,barefoothippiechick,72,10,25,"Bit of a wall of text here

**Disclaimer**: I work in the UK. I am still paid minimum wage but minimum wage for someone over 21 is £6.19ph ($9.42) here. I don't know cost of living in America but about 70% of my monthly wage is living expenses (that is rent, NOT food).
        

I work at a restaurant that puts a discretionary service charge of 10% on your bill automatically. 

**We do not get that**. 

It makes menu prices look cheaper. Less than 5% of that 10% tip is put into a kitty. I also can't take my tips above and beyond that- they go into the kitty too, BOH, FOH, housekeeping, reception, everyone. We are not kept up to date on how much money is put into the tips box, we have no idea if we're being stiffed.

Despite the fact that I serve roughly 6 tables out of a total of 14 on a Friday &amp; Saturday night (we're a five star hotel with a Michelin star chef; the restaurant is not large capacity: even a busy night will usually only have 3 relays), but very often upwards of £200, &amp; despite the fact that guests very often leave me good tips above and beyond the 10% they already think they gave me (I made £75 in above-and-beyond tips this Saturday over 5 tables, which I guess would make normal tips in America, but the ettiquette in the UK is to tip 10% not 20% &amp; in general the British are pretty poor tippers in my experience), when the 6month share came up I made £500. 

Most of you will probably know that that is some prime bullshit. If I were able to keep the tips I made (service charge included) only on Friday &amp; Saturday nights, I would make my half yearly share in a month, month &amp; a half at most. When we have American guests, I often get tipped for breakfast, &amp; if I run into long-stay house guests when they are checking out, they will press me ten or twenty bucks for my service over the days they were here because I've usually served them every breakfast &amp; dinner &amp; room service for 3 or 4 days.

**For servers:**

Does this seem fucked up to you? Is anything illegal happening here &amp; can I do anything about it (regarding the service charge not going to staff)? I'm happy to share my tips with BOH &amp; reception but I can't help feeling pissed that my manager gets a share of my tips: is this fair? I mean if they hadn't done their jobs right I wouldn't be able to do mine as well as I do, &amp; we only have 11 rooms; I work 6 or 7 days out of 7, &amp; I just came off 15 days, 10 of which were splits and my usual split pattern is 7am-2pm 6pm-12pm. Am I just being a big baby here? I want to know if this is a legitimate problem because one of the other serving girls is very dissatisfied too &amp; one waitress and two duty managers have left since I started a year ago through dissatisfaction with the company, especially working hours and pay. 

**For Customers:**

What I'm saying is- be careful with your tips, &amp; you won't be told that at interview if you apply to work there. I'd be fired if I told a customer that &amp; it got back to the company, because it cuts directly into profits as, like I said, it is there to offset cheaper menu prices. Also, although I am allowed to tell you that if you take off the service charge, the tip you leave will be shared amongst the staff,,False,t3_1cxqtq

* Interrupted me as I was telling the stragglers my name to begin ordering for himself and his wife.
* Asked for a turkey burger. Medium-rare. Wouldn't accept fully cooked poultry and chose something else.

I work in the restaurant/bar area of a hotel, we had a large group of older women in the restaurant who were down for a conference and there was a Speedway event on the Saturday night that a lot of people had come down for the weekend for. I was on the bar and, although it was pretty busy, things were running smoothly and everyone seemed very happy.

Anyway, which I put on straight away as it takes time to settle before you finish it off, and proceed to tell me the rest of their drinks orders. As I'm doing their other drinks one of the guys leans right over the bar and pulls back the Guinness tap. I look at him and say: ""sorry sir, I was just leaving that to settle before I top it up for you"". He looks at me smugly and replies: ""it's okay, I used to work in the business mate so I'm just helping you out"". He wasn't helping. I know how to pour drinks and I don't care if you 'used to work in the business', at this moment in time I'm running the bar and you're a punter, so keep your mits off my pumps. I finish off the drinks and top off his Guinness

The next night after their Speedway event they come back to the hotel and to the bar, order their drinks again and leave happily only this time the ex-pro seemed a bit miffed that he'd had to wait a while and I'd served a couple of others just buying bottled beer whilst his Guinness settled properly. As I was the only one on the bar at that time I did this just so a large crowd wouldn't gather as we waited like two minutes for his drink to settle but it's standard practise anyway.

Later on he returns to the bar and it's quietened down a bit but I'm still serving customers. I'm literally in the middle of taking an order/doing some drinks for a woman when he shouts at me ""listen mate

Let's start by saying that the place I work out does NOT get busy on a Saturday lunch at all...  we get the occasional pizza party and maybe a couple of tables. that's just the way it goes. It's worth mentioning and helpful to the story to say that our dine in pies are more expensive than the to go pies and additional 3$ to be exact.

wall of text ahead. 

Saturday lunch

 it was a warm day out so we had the AC on so here this lady comes and takes a seat without waiting for me to seat her although there's a huge 'Wait to be seated' sign before you enter the dinning room but anyway.  whatever plenty people do it and although it bugs me I let it slide. Lucifer sits down and before I introduce myself

me: Is everything okay folks? 
Lucifer: it's just fine. 

at this point her husband is already rolling his eyes at her and understands my frustration. 

So they finish eatin their food and Lucifer asks for the check while I promptly ask her for the coupon. now the plain pizza for dine in is 14.95 plus a topping it's 16.95 plus tax . So I proceed to give them the check where I had already deducted the coupon.. and i shit you not this lady goes bezerker on me. She demands to speak to the manager to the owner because of the travesty of a pizza pie being 16.95
conversation went a little like this. 

Luci: What is this price you're giving me. Oh my god.  this is why you guys are going bankrupt (we aren't) and this is why it is so dead this lunch.  noone is going to come eat pizza at a restaurant for such a price. 
me: Well we ARE usually slow on Saturday lunch because most business we get throughout the week is from office buildings around the area where executives come to eat and since they don't work weekends then it's usually dead on Saturday lunches. But I assure you we are far from going bankrupt we been open for over 13 years and are doing quite steady compared to restaurants in the area. 

Luci: This is impossible

this is when she says the thing that makes me almost laugh out loud as I work 66 hours a week. out of the 77 we r open. 

Luci: I know you guys sell your pies for 6$ my son gets em all the time

Me: *Jokers grin on my face I had already resigned to get a tip from them* Excuse me lady noone is trying to scam you or trying to steal your money

Luci: *blank stare* *husband trying to not make eye contact very embarrassed* I'm never coming back here again and I'll be sure to tell my son to never order from here again. 

I wish this story would end well but the manager was there and he got an earful of what she said and although he didn't agree. he knew my boss would chew him up if he heard about this. So he charged them 11.95 plus the topping and then took out the 3$ from the coupon and Lucifer was content. 

They left some change as tip I guess although her husband was extremely apologetic rolling his eyes at her and shaking his head. 

So that's how my story ended. I never got in trouble.  I never saw that lady again that happened about 3 or four months ago. I'm happy I actually told her off. I think it's a little sad that my manager/boss will give in to any idiot complaining loud enough. I wouldn't need their business if they were such trash.

This is important

So she says to just give her a bun without toasting it (NO BUTTER- she's allergic to that too) and no sauce on her pork. At which point I explain that meat sauce we use to moisten the pork has sauce in it too (no, I just need the regular sauce left off). Ok ma'am, but we also use buns with butter in them, so you shouldn't have that. (Again, no no just no EXTRA butter).

There have been days where we haven't been as busy as I was yesterday that I made at least 60-70 bucks in tips, so I figured at the absolute minimum I would make 50.

I got my tips today, so I asked my manager if she would check to see if they were correct. She did, and they were. When I found out, I was visibly upset.
Then, and sure enough, 40 bucks. She then said, ""I know the tips were done correctly, but I feel bad because you worked your butt off yesterday."" She then pulled 10 bucks out of her pocket, handed it to me, and then hugged me. ""I love you, let me know and I'll go over them."" I almost cried.

One evening we went for dinner at Garota De Ipanema - which is the restaurant where the ""Girl from Ipanema"" was penned.

This was our second time there before the food and service was so good. When we arrived the place was packed and the only open table was right next to the entrance. There is no door on this place

It kept getting louder and louder until finally we could see it was a guy wearing a Brazil jersey just screaming at nothing. He walks right over to the entrance and was within a foot of me

His hand was next to his face and shaking violently with a clenched fist. His other hand was in his pocket. It was at this point we realized his yelling was in English - sort of.

I say sort of because he was talking about how the world was out to get him because he was the senator of the united states of Canada. Being Canadian we were embarrassed he would be claiming to be one of us

His rant continued

If you would rather read about regular old Cluck n Feed adventures feel free to take a gander at [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/18cpwa/cluck_n_feed_1_the_man_in_the_wheelchair/)

I'm hoping I did the links right. Sorry if I messed them up

Cast list:
Grumpy pants - Marinara Manager (Formerly known as Tweedle Dee I changed his name because it might get confusing)
Micro - Chef who sexually harassed me / bullied me
Sweaty - General Manager (Formerly known as Tweedle Dum)
BB - Fillmeup Manager and Owners son
Whiskey and AmBear - Coworkers

Now on with the tale...
I put in my two weeks notice on the 10th of this month (this past Sunday) and needless to say my boss was not happy. In my reasons I wrote ""Moving on"" because he was watching me write it and I chickened out. Most of you guys told me to talk to HR and not quit because quitting would mean admitting defeat. Between my initial post and my notice I learned of a few other key issues going on at the Marinara location that basically pissed me off enough to quit. 

The next day I worked at another location. The one I originally work at will be known as Marinara and this second location will be Fillmeup. So while working at Fillmeup I took a moment to tell my manager
*You can't do your job
*What's wrong with you? Is this your first day? Should I tell Grumpy Pants to fire you?
*You're drunk! You can't do your job because you're drunk! (I mean seriously?)
*Are you stupid? Are you even awake? What's wrong with you? Just leave.

That's only a few things. He has made other coworkers cry and will mostly pick on the women. Sometimes he'll refuse to acknowledge a female server and just ask the male server standing next to her to repeat what she said. One of the most appalling things I discovered is that they have actually put shit in people's food. AmBear has found hairs

I told BB that I was leaving because I was unwilling to work for a company that would allow this treatment of the service staff and that I am seriously considering taking it to the NLRB. BB was shocked

I told BB how Grumpy Pants will also threaten to take away hours if you don't do as he says. He has threatened to take away my hours if I didn't pick up a shift even though I just plain couldn't. He will use threats and anger to get his way

Today (Tuesday in case you're in a very different time zone) I worked in the morning at Fillmeup and clocked out around 12:30. BB and Sweaty were waiting for me. I sat down with them and told Sweaty everything I had told BB the day before. He was shocked as well. Not only as Grumpy Pants but with Micro. Apparently he is an ANGEL around BB and Sweaty. I told him everything and they begged me to reconsider my resignation. I told them I would think about it. 

A few hours later I received a call from my coworker Whiskey and he told me all about how he was questioned by Sweaty and basically confirmed everything I said earlier. Next thing I know I get a call from Sweaty telling me I was now officially on a week long paid leave pending an investigation into the Marinara Cluck n Feed. This Thursday I'm meeting with HR to repeat my story for the hundredth time. I'm scared to see what happens next. Part of me feels bad if Grumpy Pants gets fired because he is nice... sometimes... but fuck all with Micro. I'll keep you updated.

Just this last Sunday, and sun-burnt. We decided to go to the nearest vegan place to try out their brunch since we've heard a lot of great things.

My restaurant sponsors a little league baseball team. Tonight the team was to come in and eat for free as a congratulations on the season from us. We were told it would be 8-10 boys and their coaches. No problem, mini burgers, fries, that kind of stuff that kids like. So pretty much the entire thing should have been incredibly easy. But like we all know too well, that's exactly when the ground falls out from under your feet...

Anyway, so we didn't have many servers on, just kinda the essential staff. So the team starts coming in and right away we have a problem. It's not just the kids and coaches, it's all their families as well. This happens at 6:30 so right during our dinner rush. The girl taking care of the party (we'll call her Zoey) was doing awesome, and trying to get drinks as fast as she can. Since it was dinner rush, the rest of us servers weren't able to help her too much, same as our manager, running food

When everyone had gotten there it turned out to be more like 40 people. Now for parties over 20 we will assign two servers to take care of it. Poor Zoey, since it was intended for 8-10 boys not 40 adults/boys. So then they all started ordering more food. By then, dinner had died down so we were able to help her out more. I ended up running most of her food for her while she was scrambling to do refills and all the other little things. Most of the tables I ran food to were understanding and very polite, except one. This table had four of the largest adults I've ever seen. I delivered their food and the patriarch snarkily said to me ""I'm missing a kids milk"" Now I took food out, I had no knowledge if he had ordered a milk or not, so just as I was about to tell him I'd find Zoey for him, she arrived beside me with the missing milk and some other things Mr. Walrus had requested. When she gave him the milk he said, ""I've been waiting for that milk for a VERY long time."" I must have had the ""you've gotta be kidding me"" look on my face

That was not the end of Mr. Walrus. After it was all said and done, and I asked her about how it all went. She said it went as smoothly as it could have gone except for Mr. Walrus. Apparently as she was cashing out some of them she had six credit cards in one hand and on her way to deliver a to-go to another table, Mr. Walrus stopped her and actually said ""before you do anything else, go get me another ranch."" She paused, tried to compute what he just said, and told him ""alright"" and then proceeded to continue taking the to-go to the other table. Apparently he was the biggest self-centered douche imaginable. She then said ""Yeah and his name was [well-known and unique musician's name here] as well! Can you believe that? What a name!"" That caused a previously unconnected synapse in my brain to turn on. I had waited on that same guy and his needy, bitchy, terrible family at my last job! He was so bad that no server would ever take care of them. The manager would have to. It made sense. He only left her a dollar or two on a much higher bill. Think less than 5%. Anyway

Since a lot of the food was free, our manager was to give her another amount of money for the rest. Well, the manager on duty called our GM to find out what Zoey should be given. I'm not sure if he explained to our GM that the 8-10 kids was actually 40 adults/kids but he was told to only give her $20. I was completely flummoxed, as was Zoey. The restaurant paid for most of the food, she took care of a very large party by herself, with at least one table of complete assholes, as well as the kids who wouldn't be quiet or stop running around the entire restaurant, and for management to pull that one on her? She's already planning on talking to our GM about it

Throughout my time at this restaurant we had a very low staff turnover due to an awesome manager who fully supported us and was just all round an awesome guy. Things went down hill as soon as he left. The lady who replaced him (lets call her Jill) was nice enough

This wouldn't be anyone elses business so long as Jill and Aaron were sensible and kept their relationship out of work

* Arguing in front of customers

* Favouritism (Aaron would ALWAYS be sent home early

* I am almost certain that Aaron was starting nasty rumours ABOUT HIMSELF! well his relationship really.. and spreading them so that he could yell at the rest of the staff for ""interfering in his private life

So gradually the restaurant lost a lot of staff
A duty manager quit, this is a fine dining restaurant, so a certain standard is expected, which has been too much for my ex-colleague to maintain all by herself, so she recently handed in her notice too... and they have recently had a lot of bad reviews on various websites.

I've been a hostess since last September at a popular seafood chain restaurant. I think I'm safe in saying that I am a reliable employee and know what I'm doing, because you can't blame it on the computer. 


An older, but on busy days she can easily juggle 6 or more (with the manager's permission) while bussing all her own tables. Since I started working, we've gotten along very well and she's great to just chat with. Mary would occasionally get on my case or roll her eyes when a less-than-desirable table would be sat in her section, but no big deal, a lot of servers tend to be like that.


One particularly awful lunch shift a few weeks ago had me following the rotation diligently when I could, throwing off my rotation. This often leads to her getting double sat, more tables than other servers, and just generally getting screwed over. I apologize all the time for it, and usually she understands, but she was super pissed at me that day. I had been giving her too many 1-tops per the rotation and then I probably double sat her 3 times because of requests. 


Things started calming down and I sat her another table, notice this table, and dramatically throw her arms up before storming into the kitchen hollering complaints about me at our coworkers. I knew she had been frustrated with me for my seating choices, but I honestly had been going by the book all day. I go in there and, quite out of character for me, confronted her and asked what the problem was. She told me that I was sitting her all ""ghetto tables"" and that they were going to notice and were going to call the restaurant out (and me specifically) on discriminating against non-whites and segregating them into a specific section. 


This was the most ridiculous accusation I've ever had of me. Everyone who walks through the doors of that restaurant is just another customer to me. Some are more irate/rude than others, however, because I guess with her vast experience she's ""learned a thing or two"" and just expects all black people to not tip as well and be generally crappy tables.

I really don't want this table. There's no way in Hell those guys will tip well enough to make it worth while. So I ask her to get the CTL Cliff to pick it up. She blushes apologetically.

""He just got double sat. He won't take it.""

Here's the thing about Cliff. He's been working in the biz for a long time now. He's an older man

That said, but the man refuses to take tables less than ten minutes apart and is usually CTL for the closing shift as he only works nights. You can see where this is a problem.

So anyways, I realize I'm screwed. They've already asked him to pick it up and he refused. I sigh like Kiph helping Zapp into his new PJ's and go greet them. 

Forty minutes and 5% later

Cliff's last tables had left twenty minutes ago, or the Hostess for being too damn nice to sit him again. I hate this shit, and I don't care if I can make $50 an hour here, I won't put up with it much longer. Co-workers like this is why our washout rate is so high, and it's why I try to teach my trainees how to handle getting double or triple sat more than anything.

TLDR: This is why we don't have nice things. And your band sucks

I was sitting in one of the dining rooms (we don't seat customers there unless its slammed or they ask) taking a quick break. We have 0 customers at the time. The door opens and 2 ladies walk in. One of the servers, seats them, and gets their drink order. She serves them 2 non-alcoholic drinks, they say they need some time to look at the menu. A minute or so later, they call over a different waitress and ask if we served steak (we've NEVER served steak) and that they've had it here before. She apologizes and informs them that we've never carried steak. The different waitress goes back to whatever she was doing and J heads over to the table. The 2 ladies get up and announce very loudly, almost shouting ""WELL, NEVERMIND THEN! WE DON'T WANT TO EAT HERE IF THERE ISN'T STEAK!"" and proceed to get up and leave out of the emergency exit. Of course the alarm sounds and after the dust settles J is totally baffled. The beverage glasses were completely empty.

I know this was probably a case of some dumb/angry ladies trying to chug some sweet tea and run, and then decided not to eat, would you give them the bill for the drinks? (Non-alcoholic)

1362046237.0,19e19l,At what point does it really become too much? ,SaphiraArach,59,8,31,"First off:  Sorry for the Wall of Text..  
   


We've all had our guests that are bad, condescending... you name it.  After having a guest who wasn't the worst I've had (but certainly no peach) it raised the question: When does it become too much?  
   
Let me give you a little backstory:  
The other night I had a heavily pregnant woman and her young daughter come in. She was very nice, of course, I knew this joiner was probably her husband or boyfriend.  However, as most of you know, we can't serve alcohol to someone who isn't there (and our managers feel VERY strongly about serving alcohol to pregnant women.)  I said ""Of course! I just have to wait until he gets here to bring it out to you. That way I can see an ID. You understand.""    
   
She was very nice about it and said
All went well until the demon-husband-from-hell showed up. I immediately saw he was clearly of age, you couldn't serve my wife? Any IDIOT could see that she's way over age! Some reason you couldn't serve her?""   The wife looked so embarrassed. As a server, I deal with people being rude as shit to me all day, but you just insulted an (as far as I've seen) innocent woman. Come on. 
Not to mention
I explained our policy to him and he just complained and waived me off. 
Long story short(ish) he was like this about EVERYTHING. Insinuating I was stupid for not carrying plates the right way
At the end of their meal, silverware, bowl, silver, a cup, a plate) I mean..the leaning tower of Piza would be jealous.. Of course I prebussed the table, this is what was left. (He wouldn't let me take any big things unless everyone was done with everything) As I was trying to hold all the mess he handed me, the wife hopped up, I heard him berate her for helping me. ""That's HER job. You don't need to be touching those disgusting things. That's what she gets paid for.""
Finally when I had the table pre-bussed (he had 5 tall boys in him and was working on his 6th.. just being more of a dick as the night went on) when I asked if anyone would like dessert and offered some options. 
Now
He goes ""HELL
I immediately apologized if I had bothered them and told them I'd check back in a bit.  The wife tried to reassure me
At this point... we're closed. 
I check back later and when I ask about dessert
I shit you not, I'm not sure yet.""  
10 minutes later
  
This...is not even...on the damn menu...  
 
  
But whatever, load them up, extra chocolate and all that jazz. 
When the bowl is practically LICKED clean
  
The bill was around 75.00.  
  
He paid in cash
After adding it all up
20%.  
   
Not what you were expecting
   
Exactly. 
Like most servers, and because they stayed so long I had all my other outwork duties finished, so all I had to do was sweep and clean their table and I could go home.
No biggie. 

   
But as I was driving home it hit me:  This is wrong. That man was verbally abusive to me for a little over 3 hours total. He was rude, insulting, hurtful... He was verbally abusive not only to ME, but to his wife as well.  He was a completely AWFUL person to serve and even worse.. to do it with a smile and what felt like a thousand apologies.  
  
But the worst part is
That relieved some of the anger and the hurt from his actions. 
  
So THAT is my question.   
   
When does it become too much? 
  
To me, I made good money.  But what am I really doing? Am I okay with this? Being treated like absolute shit for hours? Being talked down to and made to feel stupid? (I'm a pre-med student AND double majoring!) Having someone be awful to me is OKAY because I was paid for it? 
  
At first
  
But then I thought.. would this be the lesson I would teach my children (when I have them) ?   That someone can treat you like dirt; so long as you're being well compensated it's acceptable?  
  
  
   
Has anyone else had a moment like that?  Just a moment of realization where no.. you tipping me well doesn't make up for your awful personality?  
   
When does it become too much? 
   
Where and HOW do you draw the line?  
Is it possible to even do so?

   
   
TL;DR: Man treats me like shit for upwards of three hours. Complete dickwad. Tips me 20%, made good money = It's all okay. It's over with. 
But when is it too much? When/how do you draw the line and say ""No! No amount of money is worth you treating me like dirt.""",self,t5_2v480,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/19e19l/at_what_point_does_it_really_become_too_much/

 Then one a booth leaves as they are bitching and a server starts cleaning it off (she's taking that big 40 top so I know she can't finish cleaning it right away) so this woman goes ""What about that table over there"" I tell her it's a 6 top and I can't sit a party under 5 at it (and considering we've gotten big parties of 7+ all day I didn't want to give up the last big table to 4 people) and then she points to the booth.

I used to work at a pretty standard sports bar chain that marketed a lot towards 'family dining'. AKA A *lot* of families constantly using the dining room and staff as their personal babysitting service, and crappy/nonexistent tips. But I digress.
Now, pizza, and kid's meals like chicken fingers. Now mix that with a lot of young kids and one of them is gonna barf. It happens, I understand that. But it was such a pain. Even after it was mopped, the place was covered in carpet so it stunk like vomit for days after(we couldn't even seat people around it, losing out on a whole section of the restaurant). 

So that rant aside, and my stomach turn. And just as we predicted, the poor girl throws up her dinner of chicken fingers and fries- but not before the dad used his lightening fast reflexes, shoved his cupped hands right under her mouth and *CAUGHT THE BARF*. I got the impression his body reacted faster than his brain, and once he realized what he did, I opened the door for him and he shuffled out as he apologized. He came back in to wash his hands and the staff gave him a round of applause and a few coupons. His heroics saved us an evening of smelling barf, apologizing to customers for the smell

**TL:DR** Dad of the Year caught the barf.

This belief is degrading to both my gender and my profession. I get good tips because I work hard and I'm generally good at what I do. These types of presumptive comments undermine both the professionalism and intellectual aspects behind our jobs. I actually find serving to be more physically and mentally challenging than much of what I encountered in graduate school. End rant.

I've decided to start tracking my tips from men and women to see if my personal observations are accurate. 

I'm breaking up the data as so:

**Men**
| &gt;20%

**Women**
| &gt;20%

I considered including a section for married couples

I know this isn't going to be incredibly credible

**Update**

One user had a really good idea to record each actual percentage

Here's the data from last night's shift. 

**Men**

Less than 20%: 7

20%: 3

More than 20%: 0


**Women**

When I was in high school I worked as a hostess at a well known restaurant/gift shop. Somehow I became the host manager after working there for about year. Everyone else on the host staff was a teenager as well

So, trying to keep up the section rotations and helping out the servers when necessary. Then of course, there's the biggest pain: trying to set up tables for huge parties. This is where our story begins. 

An African American family of 28 people dressed in their Sunday best and who had obviously just come from church wanted a table. All together. In non-smoking. ASAP. I looked around at my super packed restaurant for about 10 minutes, I call one member of the family up to the podium to discuss the issue. I didn't get one member, I got the whole family. I explain to all of them that if they wanted to wait for one huge table that they could be here for HOURS. My solution was to split them up into 3 or 4 semi-large tables that would be close by each other. It was confirmed by the family that this was an acceptable solution and they accepted the fact that it would still take 45 mins to an hour to achieve this. 

Cut to about an hour later, they stampeded into the dining room. They see the tables and begin screaming at me (at least 6 people yelling at once) ""WE. SAID. ONE. BIG. TABLE!!! WHAT IS THIS?"" in the middle of the restaurant. Obviously I'm confused. We went over this, right? So I politely apologize because, you know, obviously I'm in the wrong. I must have imagined that whole conversation. But I politely explain that we spent the last hour getting THESE tables together. If you want that huge table, you're waiting at least another hour. They erupted. The patriarch of this family was seriously pacing up and down the aisles of the restaurant, and had the entire establishment's full attention. He is pacing and strutting and wagging his finger at me saying something along the lines of ""Now you silly little girl

**Manager:** ""Is there a problem here sir?""

**Man:** ""HELL YES THERE'S A PROBLEM

**Manager:** Okay

So he leads the family out to the lobby/gift shop. More senseless yelling and the manager trying to calm him down. Manager calls me over to have me once again explain the seating situation to the man. After much apologizing on our part and calm discussion they finally agree to keep waiting for the large table so they can all sit together. Sigh. Crazy. Most of the family wanders off to find a place to sit while they wait. While the man and my manager (tidbit: manager was a 6'9"" white man) are wrapping up their conversation

**White Customer:** ""Excuse me
Manager turns slightly toward the man. 

**Black Customer:** ""OH HELL NO! WE ARE TALKING HERE! I can't believe you have the nerve to interrupt someone's conversation!"" Then turns to the manager: ""I see how it is

**White Customer:** ""Hey now

**Black Customer's Wife:** ""HEY NOW you need to shut the F--- UP MF-er

**White Customer:** ""WAHHHT!!! *YOU* NEED TO SHUT THE F--- UP
Black customer swings at manager

**White customer:** ""I JUST WANTED TO TELL THE GUY HOW DELICIOUS MY BLUEBERRY MUFFIN WAS!!"" He pushes the black customer and runs out of the store.
 
Family starts screaming at me and the manager about how we're a bunch of stupid crackers and how they're going to sue us. A teenage girl from the family swiped at my podium, broken yankee candles, etc. We filed a police report but they were never caught. I was allowed to leave early with pay that day.

I'm prepared for comments calling me a racist. This is how it happened. It wasn't a race thing until they made it a race thing.

Sun - Thurs: 8a - 8p. Fri - Sat: 8a - 9p. You simply cannot miss it. Its pretty in your face. (this is relevant later.)

Anyway, what ever. M gets their orders, which is all breakfast, for God knows what, its 8pm on a Thursday night. I don't like doing breakfast at night, but its better than pulling everything out that I just put away. ANY WHO-- ET is NOTORIOUS for running waitresses and being really condescending/bitchy. She did it to me (once...hehe that's another story.) and she's done it to all our other waitresses. Every time M went into the dining area for her closing duties, ET would request some random thing, M would drop what she was doing and wait on this ghastly woman. 

Eventually, M is a *really nice person* really sweet, and doesn't really get mad about anything. She's pretty mellow. she tells me she never uses this word, but ET was being a total cunt. I didn't know it, but ET made M make *2 pots of coffee* because the first one wasn't good enough. Our coffee was a little strong, apparently. Well finally ET and her cronies get their food. They eat, talk. The time is about 8pm. They took about half an hour to eat, with no ice cream. M puts them together and prints bills when they finish. ET requested we take the ice cream off the total price of someone else's bill, and they cost a metric fuckton. 

(8:30; half hour after close) Then they asked for a senior discount. Oh the senior discounts. This is where I stepped in, which includes the discount in the price on the menu. We don't have a button on the POS for discounts. She wants discounts. I peeked my head around the corner, to keep M from flipping tables and raging hard, and tell ET that we discontinued the S.D. on the main menu, so they didn't qualify for it, since they ordered off the wrong menu. ET didn't try to argue with me.

about 15 minutes later, and trying to make us look bad in front of her cronies. I told her closing was actually 45 minutes ago, and we closed at 8pm. She *tried to tell me we closed at 9.* (I was just thinking *no bitch, we don't. get the fuck out.*) I re-confirmed that it was 8pm.  

The kicker: As they were *finally* leaving(8:50) they saw the little donation box for the local lions club chapter. For those that don't know what the lions club is, and its filled with mints. The first time I heard one of the lackeys speak was to hear her exclaim ""5 CENTS?!"" as if it were a massive amount of money and it would break the bank. As they walked out the door I said very loudly. ""Its for good cause, I would give them 5 cents. Not like its going to make or break someone!"" and away they went!


TL;DR: Old people are extremely cheap, and the way we work, is the cook gets the tip on to-go's since they do all the work. (Waitress may take the order, but they arent delivering anything, or waiting on them hand and foot.) I split my $8 tip with the waitress since she had some things to do on the order that I didn't have time to get myself.

They were nearing the end of their meal when a random friend of theirs came in and sat at their table. Still no big deal. He was just meeting them and didn't want to order anything.

To start, and throughout my life I've been in many of them. Good ones, crappy ones, everything in between. I've been in small town bars before, too. Nothing prepared me for this.


For my mom's birthday one year we went to check out a newly built casino. For the record it was me, my dad, and my sister. We are all lower middle class looking people, I think. Upon arriving at the casino we discovered they didn't have any sort of restaurant so we asked a security guard if there was a place to eat nearby.


I don't want this to get too lengthy, an establishment called ""Klinker's Bar &amp; Grill"". The name wasn't encouraging, but it looked okay on the outside.


We walked inside


We sat down in the eating area, which turn out to be pretty standard bar fare, which was exactly as we expected. We look at the menus, but we're all feeling uncomfortable and unwanted. We wait for him to come back to ask about drinks. I get more uncomfortable, and we start to discuss if we should go somewhere else. I finally can't take it any more, and say I want to leave. So we stood up, and right as we did so the bartender was coming over to us


A simple greeting (even if disingenuous), you didn't want to make a bunch of food, and we apparently looked like uptight city-folk or some bullshit to you. Apparently making money for the place and getting a tip was too much work.  ",,False,self,t5_2v480,,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/19cu39/worst_bar_ever/

The owner was a great, as well as the top chef.  The waiter manager, my boss, had apparently never ran a restaurant before, because us waiters didn't even *have* sections.  We were assigned tables on a rotation schedule based on which tables were seated.  This lead to dumb shit like a waiter having tables on literally opposite sides of the restaurant.

There was only one hostess, because I was one of two guy waiters among the female waitresses (actually I can't even remember if there was another male waiter or if I was the only one).  I can't think of any other reason except I was a total waiter noob, but I wasn't a complete ignoramus of how a restaurant is run, after the three and a half years of busboy experience.

So one night, and when the guy asked for Heinz 57 sauce for his steak, got really pissed when I told him we only have A1.

They were finishing their meals when the hostess bitch told me that she needed their table ASAP, as graciously as I could, tell them that their table was needed for more customers.  The Heinz 57 guy was, obviously, pissed off, and demanded to see the restaurant owner.  I got the owner and the guy let him have both barrels about how shitty the restaurant was and that they wanted a full refund, which the owner gave them.  They did leave me a tip

During the next staff meeting, I'll quit.  After that she tried to kiss my ass.

Alright, she took her job and yours very seriously. She also wore too much eye make-up. She was the kind of person to talk about you to another server while you were 10 feet away cleaning tables. That happened, whatever. Anyway, she would get you into trouble with the head store manager and act like he just happened to find out on his own. She also told all our co-workers MULTIPLE times that I had officially been fired. I never understood why she was doing this, since I always had my job and was never fired- it just made her look stupid.

So here's my story.

It was Friday and my shift just started. I come in, it was a slow day. So, Jean told me that I could go home and that if she needed me, she would call. HOWEVER, and I fucking STRESS THIS, HOWEVER- she said (and I quote) ""If I don't call you before 7, then don't worry about coming back in."" (As in, she should be calling before 7. If not

She called me at 7:10. I missed said call because I was grocery shopping. However, so it was after 7 when she called, but I didn't see the missed call until like 8:30. **She** only tried to call **once** and did **not** leave a message, so I thought it wasn't a big deal. Cool. Not.

SO. Sunday rolls around and we have a staff meeting. I show up and sit with all my co-workers waiting for this shit to get over with. All of a sudden, only to find my giant douche canoe of a store manager back there waiting for me. *sigh* This conversation took place, all while Jean is standing right next to us:

**BossMan: So tell me what happened on Friday.

Me: I don't know. What happened on Friday?

BossMan: (he thinks I'm being sassy

Me: Well that didn't happen. 

BossMan: According to Jean here

Jean: Yeah

Me: First of all, and again, she was the only one to call.

Jean: Yes we did.

BossMan: I'm going to go ahead with what Jean's telling me

Me: Excuse me, just to show you that I'm not the one making crap up.**

BossMan proceeded to tell me I was on an unpaid leave for a week and I would get a call from him saying if I would be keeping my job. He eventually did call and I did still have my job

Well, and quite rude to BossMan over the phone, but whatever, he's a prick.

1368950983.0,1emey0,Why is that my fault??? (tiny rant),Shimshimhe,48,11,18,"I work in a small (super tiny) restaurant and for the most part

Tonight
Two ladies came in for dinner and all seemed normal. They weren't super friendly or anything

It was time for them to pay and one of them grabs the check and gives me her debit card. I slide it and... the machine can't read it. I try again and again for a couple of minutes (earning me a somewhat evil eye from my busy co-worker) but it won't read the damn card.
Our restaurant policy is that we can't input the data on the machine manually (it requires too much personal information and the owner is not comfortable with that), I let her know that the magnetic stripe on her card is most likely damaged because the machine is not having a problem reading any other cards.

The lady who gave me the card lets out a *huge* sigh and takes it from me

She lets out another sigh and tells me that I should let people know if the credit card machine isn't working *before* they place their orders. What if she hadn't had any cash? She spends another couple of mintues ranting about how irresponsible we are. Seriously?

.... I just. Really?
I mean, but I **just** told you that the problem was with *your card*, not our machine! 

And if you hadn't had any cash? Maybe we would have called the cops

I haven't really had any problems with people not being able to pay their bills (we have only Mastercard and Visa stickers on our windows but we still get people trying to pay with Amex - not that I mind

It's *not* our fault that you put your damn card on something that damaged it and you obviously know that your card is damaged from the confident way you said I could just input your address into the card machine because you ""don't mind."" So, I hope you never step foot in our restaurant again.

Later in the shift I was walking back to my hostess stand when I saw Patty playing around on my computer. Servers do it a lot, greeted the guests, and checked them in for their reservation. Meanwhile I grabbed the menus so I could seat them, and Patty turned, snatched the menus and proceeded to take the table to her section. I said her name and made a ""really?"" face, and she just stormed away. 10 seconds later she sticks her head around the wall that was separating us and asked ""well what do you want me to do with them!?"" I was so exhausted already I told her I didn't care. She sat them in her section and she stormed back into the lobby/hostess area and yelled ""well what do you want me to do with table 43, then?!""

And as customers don't ever seem to realize, dining room upstairs

Of course I am working a pretty full section (as is everyone else) when a walk-in party of 20 people arrive and are seated, people arrive and order drinks as they please (oh also, did I mention it was happy hour on top of it?) some even throw appetizers in, then by the time you bring those drinks, more people arrive and this goes on and on. THEN you need to take orders for the group, and of course everyone wants to special prep every single thing in their meal. By the time I finish taking the orders and start the task of putting them in, a smaller party of maybe 10 people arrive in my section. So I decide to quit the little progress I made in my food entry and just go greet the table or else they would be waiting too long. Of course they just decide to order everything at once instead of letting me get the drinks and give them some time to look the menu over (plus giving me a little time to play catch up with my other party). Now I have tons of food to put in and drinks etc. Everything is fine, but my manager approaches me and says my party of 10 is VERY unhappy. I explained I was waiting on drinks at the bar to get all their drinks at once

Fast forward some general running around and grabbing drinks etc. and my party of 20 gets their food. Things are going fine, you guessed it, all separate checks. Fortunately I asked them earlier if this would be the case, so I had everything written down for each individual person, but as the night goes on, people randomly order drinks that you don't even bother writing down because you just want to get them in and drop them off. So now starts the task of splitting 20 separate checks, of course things were unaccounted for, fixing it and finally it is all done. My manager approaches me again saying there was a couple who was very unhappy complaining about 1.) I never took appetizer orders and he had to come down the stairs to tell me what they wanted (um...I did, not the 2 oz. cups we normally do, and my manager was super understanding so it was okay. But having never had a single complaint ever

Despite all of this, one of my co-workers took over half of my section, people ran drinks and food and throughout the entire time I was consistently asked, ""Are you okay? What can I do for you?"" Near tears by the end of the night, everyone came over and gave me the biggest hugs ever with reassuring words about what a good job I did and how everyone has those nights etc. Seriously, this made me really realize just what great people I work with and  wanted to say a thank you, in general, I was really reminded that there is a lot of good.

1365394689.0,1bwcg0,An open letter response to '20 Most Annoying Things Servers Do',Supermagiccolagirl,47,9,35,"Just incase you didn't read it
http://firstwefeast.com/laugh/the-20-most-annoying-things-servers-do-at-restaurants/

This is my open letter response to the butthead who wrote it.  If anyone has something to add to the explanation

~Warning~ Wall of Text Ahead ~

 Servers introduce themselves by name
	Ok
		1. We respond quicker if we hear 'Hey Glenn' instead of 'Uh sir' or 'Waiter!'
		2. If you can't find us and another server is trying to help you
		3. And yes

Touching
	I'll give you that. Touching can be a little weird. But if it's an accidental arm brush or shoulder knock, we're going to have to touch your plate and 95% of the time, our hands are cleaner than yours.

Saying everything is amazing
	Newsflash! We're here to sell you stuff! Instead of asking 'How's the burger?' maybe you should ask us 'What is your opinion on the bacon burger?'  I know that I will always give my honest opinion

Wait forever for water and whatnot
	I don't know if you know this but there is a good chance that you are not our only table. Also, there would be a good chance that it would just take up table space.  As for the bread and chips, would you rather them hot and fresh from the kitchen or cold and stale because they were left on the table, waiting for the chance for you to come and sit?And frankly, from what I've seen, most people don't like to be bum-rushed when they sit down.  I, personally

""Do you know how the restaurant works?""
	Again with the mind reading pants.  We have no clue if you have been here before.  We don't know if you know that we put jalapeños and guacamole in our tapas to make it more Tex-Mex.  We do this so you know what you're getting and what to expect. 

'You need to ask your waiter'
	Normally, they will be more than happy to grab it for you... if it is something they can get.  Ask for extra ranch? Sure! Another refill of Coke? Of course!  Another beer? Not so much. At most restaurants, alcohol has to be entered in to the computer by the server who is in charge of the table. They either have a card, number, or password that they have to enter into to system in order to get a beer.  You want dessert?  Again with the magic passcode/card.  For the most part, the other servers will help out as much as we can before we have to grab your server. Just don't get annoyed when we tell you that not just anyone with an apron can grab you your beer.


Taking a knee
	There are tall servers in this world.  There are also servers how have a hard time hearing over the music, 23, and 11. There are guest who like to talk in to their menus.  There are also guests who like to mumble.  Those are the main reasons we take a knee or squat.  Sitting should never happen.

The upsell
	Just like you have quotas and deadlines for your job, to losing shifts and hours.  Just humor us by listening and politely telling us that the regular mac is fine.  

Make you feel bad for just getting dessert
	We're not mad if you grab a dessert and some coffee, we can normally get two or three tables and make anywhere from $5 to $30 in that time frame. But no. We are waiting on you to have your fill of coffee and molten cake.  Also, we may be waiting to go on break or go home and we can't leave until you do.  If you are the reason that I don't get a break and have time to sit, eat, go to the bathroom, or just plain rest, you can bet you will feel bad.  

""Do you need Change?""
	There is a reason we ask this and most of the time, the only register we have is in the bar and it is ONLY for the bartender.  I'm asking you if you need change because I need to know if I'm going to spend 10 minutes asking all the servers if they they have change for the $100 or the $50 or the $20.  And then after all that we come back to find that either, you left leaving us the change, you're still there waiting to know how much change you're getting because you can't do math and you think that we are walking change makers, or you're there and annoyed that it took me 10 minutes to get your change because I had to go through six different people to get it. So, it's not just because we want a tip; it's to save us and you time.

Special's Prices
	We gauge your interest when we tell you about the specials.  If you're super into it, or just overall not interested, we're not going to tell you.  Think about it; if you're not into the seafood, you're not going to look for the seafood prices.

Taking away your plate
	If you have four fries left on your plate and you have been chatting away with your buddy for ten minutes, don't put your napkin on your plate if you still want to eat what's on it.  That's gross.  And, if you and whoever you are with are going to the bathroom, leave something at the table so we know not to take your stuff. It's really that simple.

Over sharing
	If I ask you if you need anything else and you crack the lame joke of 'Oh can it be free?' I'll give you a laugh and tell you that 'I would love to but my education can't pay for itself!' I might tell you what I'm majoring in and what I want to do with it.  I might say that my mom has the same blouse or shoes. I want you to know that I am a person and that I do have some semblance of a life outside of work.  I know the servers who will stand there and talk about what their five kids are doing every hour of the day.  I understand this one and it can be a hit or miss with who you have as a server.

Passing off mistakes 
	We will apologize for any mistake. That's just a fact.  I can't help it if the kitchen dropped your well done steak late

Going all out on Cheese and Pepper
	Yeah that sucks... Maybe try asking for it on a separate plate and add at your leisure?

Happy face checks
	If you let slip that it's your anniversary or your kid just won his soccer game, we actually mean it.  We took the time to to put that there because we are actually grateful that you were there.  We aren't doing it to be cute.  We are doing it to let you know that we are listening to you and what's going on in your world and not just ours.  

Hit on your date
	Yeah

Napkin Folding
	Now

'Another' and 'More'
	I didn't know that these were secret code words.  I use them interchangeably. 

Disappearing
	If you down right scare us, that's a good way to make us poof.  Sometimes, we get stuck in the kitchen, helping out and what not.  We try not to disappear but we can't always be right next to your table.  We have ten million other things to take care of. ",,False,self,False,t3_1bwcg0

So I get my first table, once the dinner rush started, they kept re-ordering their fish as soon as I could get their plates out to them. At this point, I'm shaking half to death because they're getting impatient and I'm running around the kitchen like a chicken with my head cut off looking for someone to help me with our goddamn computer system. I couldn't figure out how to resend an order, and my orders weren't being shown on the line.

Cue my second table, a strawberry shake, and a chocolate shake. So I run back to find someone to help me make these shakes because I have no clue. Finally, I get help, and it takes me longer than 5 minutes to get my drinks out to them. (time standard is 2). When I set the drinks on the table, they sort of raise their eyebrows at me, but they don't say anything. They aren't ready to order yet

 I'm supposed to suggest one of our pies at least three times. So the woman says that yes, party of one, in the middle of my three table section. Shit. I'm really freaking out because the kitchen is completely backed up and I'm running 15 minute tickets as it is. (10 minutes is time standard) I have no idea what to do, because my boss asks me what kind of appetizers we have. Shit! I have no clue, they aren't on the menu, therefore I didn't memorize them. He is not impressed. Strike one. He orders an appetizer and a sandwich with a specific change to it. I enter it into the system and I'm pacing up and down the line, wondering where the fuck my reorders are. Through all this, so when I went to get my other three-top's order, but I need my orders

The other table's order finally came up

After a few more fuck ups with plate presentation at my boss's table, and lists my various mistakes. He then points to the three-top in front of him, the milkshake people, and told me that was his family. I'm cringing pretty hard at this point. I know I did bad. I forgot to ask one of the customers how he wanted his eggs, I gave one of them coffee instead of the coke he wanted, I didn't fill up my boss's glass all the way, I sloppily put ranch in his side cup, but I'm still unhappy.

We have a new hire, pregnant, beauty-school dropout, and she still smokes although she's at least three months along. She is one of those people who are generally a pain in the ass to work with. She never finishes her side work, begs others to pick up her slack, and is not a team player at all. Aside from that, she's an *AWFUL* server. Always forgetting about her tables, fucking up orders frequently

This story begins a week or two ago, I'll summarize by saying it was one of the worst shifts I ever worked.

Pause from that for a moment. We have another newish server, and at first I didn't see what bit his crotch, because while she hasn't an intelligent thought roaming in her head, she seems pretty benign to me. That is, until that particular Wednesday night hell unfolded.

I arrived at 5:30. Drama King had clocked on two hours prior to me, it IS Wednesday.* this special brings the cheapest crowd out. (I'm sure you know what type I'm talking about.) That night was crazy and ill-planned, with servers being sat all over the place. I was turning tables like mad, and running around to satisfy all the guests. And yet, my tips seem to be particularly shitty. Shittier than they should have been. It appeared that tables were stiffing me more often than they were leaving me money. Which was a little fishy. Drama King starts getting really fired up a while later and claims that Ditzy is stealing money off his tables while he is running food. I was a little skeptical, but I listened. I watched Ditzy follow Drama King around and wander past his dirty tables behind his back. While I didn't see her straight-out pocket the money, she was definitely acting sketchy. But I had full hands and more important things to worry about than his and my shitty tips. Then one of our MOD's exclaims that anyone who doesn't know how to work the register should not be touching it, and when she said yes, my night continued in a shitstorm

Later, which was completely disproportional to my sales, which were over 200$. He rants that he was there longer than I was and had twice as many tables. Now, we don't tip out where I work (no one to tip out to, we pretty much do everything), so that 24$ was literally all I got for that 4 hour shift, which was supposed to pull in at *least* 40-ish bucks.

Fast-forward to tonight, Ditzy, and another server we will call Lovely. I was really bored, with only a couple of tables. I kept seating myself with new guests, but every time I went to get their drink orders, Ditzy had fucking stolen them!

I decided, I am going to give my all to the tables I *did* have. I put that charm on, and was having great interactions with my tables, they were laughing and smiling, the whole nine yards. Yet, when they started to leave, no tips! I had been handed 2$ by one table, although I had only been there for about an hour. So I totaled only four tables for the night.

I moped around in the service aisle for a while, I had an ""Aha"" moment. Every time Ditzy worked, everyone else seemed to fare lousily in tips, while she claimed to not have earned one cent. What really made me mad was that Ditzy was the closer, so naturally, she had better tables even though she sucked. I confronted her slyly about it, after consulting with Lovely
""So

""No girl

""Really? I thought that regular always tipped well.""

""I don't know girl

*sigh* ""Well

""I didn't get no money yet. I only had like three tables.""

""I thought you had at least 20 by now.""

""Nope.""

That conversation went nowhere, so I knew she was aware of Ditzy's stupidity and lies. She was upset and told me she would phone the GM. After a while, she came back and told me that the GM would pay for my dinner tonight and investigate the issue, as this is not the only time she had been accused of being a dirty fucking thief. Well that was nice and all, but a free dinner is not going to pay for a car or tuition.

/rant. Wtf am I supposed to do about this bitch? I am pretty sure she has been robbing us of our tips, and I didn't make anywhere near minimum this night. I had to go have a little tantrum in the walk-in before I clocked out, I was so pissed off. Thoughts? Advice?

I'm the senior bartender at a fairly popular alternative nightclub.  Depending on the night the music is goth/industrial, burlesque, drag shows, we had a hip-hop night until someone pulled a gun... we cater to a wide group of people, and you aren't likely to hear any pop hits/club bangers, etc.

One night I was working we were having our quarterly throwback rave night.  I typically don't like working those nights, but my facade is professionally friendly.

Doors open at nine, but it's too loud for small talk.

Then I see this guy coming up out of the corner of my eye.  He's kind of bigger than average, and I notice he's just sort of staring into space.  After about a minute I get to him.

""Howdy

""What's your cheapest shot?""

A question every bartender longs to hear.

""Anything rail is three dollars.""

""I'll have five shots of rail."" He says

""Rail what?"" I ask

""Vodka.""

I pick up five shot glasses

""You got it!"" I say

The five shots are poured

He gives me a twenty and I turn towards the cash register.  The air is positively vibrating with drum &amp; bass
feeling that something is wrong. 

My bartender sense is tingling!  

I turn around to see him setting down an empty shotglass.  The last empty shotglass.  Red-faced and gasping like a drowning man
I being to give him his change

He leaves no tip.

As there's no one left to serve, under a minute later he starts to hurl.  Directly onto the table.  Severely splashing several of his friends.  Grossed out, they go to the bathroom, clean themselves as much as possible while he goes in as well, presumably to throw up some more.  One of the group comes over to me, a shorter white girl, bleached blonde

""I'm sorry?  My friend threw up on the table? Can I have a towel? Or something?""

I hand a rag over, dripping onto the floor.

One night (at nights we only had 1 manager, we only delivered within about a 10 mile radius as to uphold to our company slogan, ""Sandwiches so fast, you'll freak."" As per every customer, I asked for a phone number to enter in, as that was how we brought up previous customers' information. This was a new customer, so his information had to be put in. I asked for his name and address, knowledgeable of the area

Man: ""Sure thing

We have a small map taped to the wall near where our phones are to quickly check where we deliver to, I was not able to quickly find it.

Me: ""Sir

All I get in return is a short grunt of confirmation. Okay, 45 seconds of me waiting for the GPS to locate the address, the customer chimes in:

Man: ""How long does it take you to FUCKING look up one damn address?""

Me: ""I am sorry sir

Man: ""Are you a fucking moron, you fucking idiot!""

And this point I should mention that during this night we were slow, he nodded and gave me the confirmation to hang up if he didn't cooperate.

I greeted a table of two couples, because the guys were starting to sound kind of drunk and they'd been drinking our strongest beer. I went off to find Chelsea and tell her. She was about to deliver a beer to one of the ladies at the table (which I was fine with, it was our least alcoholic beer and the women seemed fine, it was just the men who seemed drunk). She said ""when I drop this off, I'll tell them they can't order any more drinks unless they get more food, too."" I tried really, really hard to convince her that that was a bad idea and she shouldn't say anything unless they tried to order another round. But apparently she didn't listen. She came up to me a few minutes later and said

""[The manager] had to go over and talk to the table. I cut them off and they were really mad at me."" I asked her what exactly she said to them, This is the last beer we can serve you tonight. If you want to order more food, we will reconsider, but if not we're cutting you off. We're just concerned about you because you're so drunk."" She also said something about seeing the girlfriends ""stumbling"" on their way to the bathroom. 

The manager was at the table for about 20 minutes, and before this incident I'd been sure of a decent tip since they all seemed to really like me. The entire time Chelsea was telling me what she'd said, all I could think was, ""didn't you do your ServSafe alcohol training??""

I have barely walked in to the kitchen and tied on my apron when my coworkers yell ""Outrageoushamster, more like two and a half blank stares. I can tell right away something is... off with these men. One of them looks at me with a cock-eyed glance and sort of a strange facial expression like his mouth is stuck in an awkward smile/grimace.

""Oh! Certainly! And what can I get for you two?""

Aforementioned guy grunts that he wants a cherry coke. The guy sitting next to him is so hard to understand I just look back at the mean one until he tells me rudely that he also wants a cherry coke.

So I walk back into the kitchen to grab their drinks and am greeted with snickers. I just glared at my coworkers.

""Having fun?"" One of them smirks.

""What is up with my table?"" I ask.

""They're inbred."" She responds. ""Haven't you seen them here before?""

""Um

""I am! Those are the brothers that come in all the time. And don't even spend too much time over there

Wrong.

I go bring them their drinks and ask if they're ready to order. In return I get blank stares. I tell them I'll give them a few more moments

Before I can even set down the plates, they pick up the glasses and try to hand it to me and start grunting. ""Oh sure, let me just set this down and I'll get you a new coke right away."" Nope, I go grab their refills. Every time I go back to the kitchen

Finally, I'm taking another table's order when they decide to make this known to me. They are thumping on the side of the booth and glaring at me. I finish up with my other table and hurry over, slightly pissed off at this point.

""NO

And so they order another dinner, and then hurry over to my other tables because the whole transaction had taken much longer than I expected. When I finally go to the kitchen to see if my order went in the way I intended, the cooks just give me this ticked-off glare because of all the modifications and subs they want. All I can do is yell ""I'm sorry!"" and go back on the floor because I've been sat again. The brothers have been watching me do everything, and I mean everything all night so far. It's not only creepy, but annoying. They are thumping the side of the booth and grunting at me again while I greet my new table. SERIOUSLY, WAIT YOUR GODDAMN TURN.

James would come in every day for breakfast and rarely alter his order. One egg, small amount of grits with extra butter.

Also, he would take up a full booth instead of sitting at the bar no matter how busy the shift was. Sometimes Sam and Daniel would invite him to sit with them to save a booth for us (One of their redeeming qualities).

Billy, was obviously mentally ill and physically disabled. His ranting would often remind me of an uncle of mine, a schizophrenic. Billy would come in at least twice a day, often more.

And it will be disgusting. You have been forewarned.

Amy had the worst of it I'll admit. She had open to three today. Around 11:30 she got her first table which was a group of 16

The kids went into the section in the back room that was closed off and decided to rearrange the furniture. They dragged a good dozen chairs into the center of the section and layed them on their backs and all over each other. The back section has eight tables in it. All of them had sugar packets dumped all over them and the salt and pepper shakers from all the tables were hidden. Amy's nerves were being tested

When Amy started getting more tables in the other room where the 16 top was the kids decided to go unleash their terror on the front room. They ran around screaming. And went to the bucket of silverware and unrolled it onto the floor. Forks

A little while later she has to go to the bathroom really bad. On her way, they decided to get the toilet bowl brush, mash the crap all over the toilet bowl and then paint the walls in it. 

Yes

Amy was livid. She ran to the guys room to use their toilet before she peed herself in anger. She's also kind of a neat freak

She left at 3 and my night went alright, I already had a six and some smaller ones there. 

Until the parents of this group let their small army of tiny people run around through the dining room. The other server and I kept trying to dodge the kids while the slithered between us while we ran food and bussed our tables. This grew annoying quickly but not when the little boy they had, but twice. Parents did nothing, and this kid hit hard both times. Like fall down dizzy hard. The mom barely looked over and said watch out. The older brother was a better parent than her, he at least picked up his brother and checked his head. 

On their way out I had a both arms full of dishes and random other things to put away. The same kid who nearly knocked himself out twice had ran into my path and barely escaped a bloody face. I barely put on my anti-lock breaks and stopped when the kid barreled into my legs and nearly put me on the ground. That's when big brother stepped in again and apologized while his mom played with her phone and walked to the front door. I smiled at the kid and told him it was alright and he was doing a good job as a big brother. The kid still looked ashamed as he glanced over and followed his mom and dad out the door. Then when I went back to help the other server the kids had decided to turn the straw wrappers into confetti

1357765977.0,169rj6,Restaurant manager makes a big deal out of my sister's tip today...Akwardness ensues.,Mudbloods4Voldemort,42,8,21,"(In advance

BACKGROUND:
My sister is well-known in my family for leaving big tips for great service. She works in a hotel and she knows how hard people bust their ass for low pay. She's known to leave $10-$30 tips (on ~$20 meals). Sometimes she'll give a normal sized tip to our main waiter and the same tip to someone who delivered our food and took extra orders.

ACTUAL STORY:
My sister was deciding on what her tip would be at the counter (where you pay) for this 24/7 national breakfast chain. (Not WH)  Our waiter was great! He didn't bother us much and was really courteous when they were out of things that I ordered in the kitchen. I also have a really hard time choosing something on the menu (which I correct by looking up the menu online before but I'm still pretty bad about it.) So he was patient with me and my sister and never let our drinks sit empty for long. Basically great service. So my sister leaves a ~$11 tip, this was out of the ordinary for the store manager who sees this and FLIPS out. He calls the server and other manager over to show them and basically makes this huge scene. It's pretty awkward for both my sister and me AND the server. My sister prefers it to be kind of a surprise and likes to leave before they see it so they don't have to show thanks and such.

TL;DR: Sister leaves good tip

As a Customer

I'll start.

As a Server, but we've all had our days. But, I would always try to compliment on something I liked about someone at the table (lady has a pretty necklace, guy has a sweet t-shirt, etc).

If people were extra understanding when their food took a while to get to them or maybe I dropped something of theirs, I gave them 25% off because it was the guys birthday- and because ALL of them were fucking hilarious, awesome people. When he got the bill, I didn't mention that I gave him the discount, I just did the usual ""Thanks guys, have a great day!"" and walked away. Until he realized, stood up in the busy dining area and shouted at my Manager ""HEY! You've got one fantastic waitress! Thanks miss!-(to me)"" It made my day to make his day

I've also had people personally go and flag my manager down to tell them how sweet and accommodating I was to them and their specific needs. My manager hated me though

People also really seemed to like when I would suggest a certain thing to them

This leads me to talk about having awesome tables and them doing nice things for me.

My very first table I ever served, bare with me, I'm new."" And the man (60's I'd say, big jolly bearded guy) gets a huge grin on his face and says ""Oh ho! Well that's fantastic! I guess we'll have to tip you extra nice! Good luck, we're real feisty!"" and we all laughed. They ended up tipping as they said they would, it made a lasting impression on how super nice they were to me.

On a final note, for the love of /r/atheism, don't get mad if your restaurant has one busser who is busting their ass trying to keep tables clean. Where I work, I get no respect, thanks, or acknowledgement from servers unless I actually tell them their tables are ready for more people. 


So, you are sorry you can't spend the day with them, and keep that (fake) cheerful smile on your face.

So joking around with customers is one of my favorite things about the job (I'm sure most of you would agree), or say ""Are you sure about that? Maybe you should hold off on making that decision until you've tried a bite. You may not want to share anymore after that!"" when I bring an item out to a couple that mentions that they're splitting an entree. Keeps you sane on busy nights sometimes, y'know?


We're one of those places that offers free, ""Ah, yes, thank you for bringing that out for us! My wife has a bit of a weakness for good bread!"" So I reply, ""haha, well unfortunately, we have a whole lot of it in back!"" The husband kind of winces and says quietly, not *un*fortunately...""

It was a normal night in Hell... I mean, Tal, we have about 20-30 people coming in.  Where do you want us?""

**Lesson 1 of Big Group Etiquette:**  Let the restaurant know you're coming, but this can go for fast-food places as well.  Doing this is a big help to the staff, and it will mean we can put together a place large enough for your group faster.

Whew, so I do.  They trickle in in twos and threes, and head to the back room.  Because of this, I was able to serve all of their drinks by myself.  I will admit, some of my co-workers offered to help, but I told 'em I had it.  And I did, but just wanted to be clear that I took the responsibility for this big group on myself.

When everyone arrived

**Lesson 2:**  When you're a part of a big group

**Lesson 3:**  Your server is human.  It's okay to joke around with him/her while the food is being prepared.  Also

This group was awesome!  They joked around with me

Then the food started coming out.  My fellow servers helped bring the food out of the kitchen, and were polite when they flagged me down.

Turns out, and I didn't do much for them besides the usual refills/busing their tables during all this.  Again, still super polite, joking around with me, and all around awesome throughout this whole time.

They were there for a good two hours or so before they left.  When they did, they also gave me some of the freebies from their anime con.  I also got a job offer from one of them, and they ALL thanked me for serving and putting up with them.  Again, really awesome!  Which brings me to the final lesson of big group etiquette.

**Lesson 4:** If you are a big group

In the USA, it means you're taking up tables and time, and a server could usually get through a couple of smaller tables in the time it takes to serve you.  Even if you can't give an outrageous tip, at the very least, be awesome enough that a server would gladly serve you again, even if you come back in a big group

I have never been more disgusted in my life. I didn't even care if I only made $30 for 5 hours of work and had to split the tip with her.

In fact, one person wrote, ""I dont wanna leave no tip"", I kid you not. 

The only saving grace was that half of them did tip and the birthday girl gave us some cake and an additional $10. But even at that point

But first:

The Owner and the Biker.

Ours was an artsy and eclectic neighborhood, and I never heard of any customers of staff ever being hassled.  They kind of kept the peace, actually.

The thing is, we had visits from the neighbors for quick shots.  We went through a lot of tequila.  This is all fine, as you know we made most of our profit on drinks anyway, so no big deal.

Now, the boss's mom visiting from the Old Country, a wild hair or what.  In any case, the boss exits the front as a group of bikers is ambling across the street, being easily visible from the cooking line.  He informs them that, no, they will not be welcome to come in for a few quick shots.  Not tonight, but he is fine.

That kind of ruined the whole neighborhood vibe.  We closed the small bar, the bikers moved up the hill.  The bar switched to a (one-time) micro-brewery outlet, and is now a coffee house...

I started serving when I was 17

Well, was hired by what I thought was a well-off Malaysian restaurant that we'll call Malaysia.  I showed up for my first day of work, and I very quickly found out this place was totally different than any other restaurant I'd ever worked in or seen.  And not in a good way.

For starters, have owned the place for 22 years, and now their daughters, let's say Mary and Anne, manage the restaurant on nights and weekends while Rosa manages the place for weekday lunches.  They also have a son, Andy, who runs their other restaurant, the more of the family that's in the restaurant, they frequently micromanage to the extreme.  Mary and Anne also never want to be there, and frequently will just sit at a table and eat and act like it's a damn burden if they have to take a table or apply a discount or anything.

Secondly, he's a very angry person, and any sort of interaction with him is highly discouraged  and usually has to go through the managers.  He's also the only person in the kitchen besides the dishwasher and on weekends, we have a girl who does really basic stuff like assembling spring rolls and grilling satay.  He's a damn good cook, I'll give him that, but he has no communication or interpersonal skills and doesn't deserve to be called a chef.  And when the restaurant gets slammed, with just him back there

Third, we have no busser and no hostess.  So we have to do those jobs on top of what we normally do.  Also, the restaurant surprisingly has a full liquor license but no bar.  Just an alcohol cage and no trained bartenders.  So servers have to pour wine and beer (no problem) and make specialty cocktails and fresh juices and ginger ale (problem) because we receive no real bartending training, there are no pre-prepped juices (we squeeze the lemon and lime to order) and making a drink takes a good 40-80 seconds per drink, which if you're dealing with a bunch of different cocktails for a 6 top on a Friday night, can throw you in the weeds, hard.  We also make all the desserts, and assemble an entree that was recently featured in a local paper.  Along with our serving job.  We have no sections, or access the cash drawer or apply any discounts including any of the Groupons or newpaper or email promotions we've been running.

I'm getting really frustrated because the owners and managers come down on every little mistake made, I hear about it from Rosa, Cal, Anna, Mary, and Andy.  And every lecture makes what I did sound worse.  For example, over the last 4 shifts, I didn't ring in a (non-alcoholic) drink before I served it, no problem, Cal

The most frustrating thing is, but it's also owned by the family and they've told me I have to work at Malaysia if I'm going to work at Sushi.  I'm getting so frustrated with the family and how inefficient and terrible Malaysia is and how much I still have to do that I'm thinking of leaving the industry entirely and putting my degree to use elsewhere.

A couple months ago I began working at a new restaurant. We pool tips

However, they only report the difference between the $2.13 minimum wage for servers and the $7.50 minimum wage they are required to give me in total. Basically, if I work 10 hours in a week (obviously I work more, but we'll keep it easy) I earn 21.30 in hourly wages, but the legal minimum wage for that work is 75.00. My employer thus reports that I made 53.70 in tips. However, I might have actually made $150 in that period.

Now, my wages are being severely under-reported and I'm afraid this might be a problem should I need to apply for an apartment, a loan, credit card, etc. Also, I want to pay my taxes accurately.

2.) People who don't control their children at all.    Look, we can't see the entire floor) but also dangerous for your child. Kidnappers look like everybody else people. Example? The other day a boy of about 6 years of age was running around the place with no shirt on yelling ""Woooo!""   It's funny on iCarly...not where I work. 
  
3.) People who don't realize that I don't cook your food. I'm your server. I'm not your chef. Waving your steak in my face saying
I'm sorry
   
  
4.) Don't...cut...me...off... I know you may not understand it, if not more. I hate it. It's stupid. I can't change it.   So, when I walk up to your table do NOT say ""Water with lemon"" before I can even open my mouth! Furthermore, please actually LISTEN to what I'm saying. ""Hi! How are you guys doing this evening?"" ""Water with lemon.""  
   
...wtf?  You can feel like a beverage now? That's my personal favorite. I giggle inwardly and contemplate how someone can feel like water with lemon. Transparent and bitter? Hmm..
   
5.) People who come to a nicer, we're on an 85 minute wait and a group of six sits down that want to catch a movie later.  Date night, I get that, but PLAN AHEAD. It's not a leap to assume we'll be busy at 6:30 on a Saturday. ""We're in a hurry, we're trying to catch a movie. Can you let the kitchen know?""   Yes... yes, let me let them know to put your order ahead of everyone else's because you're in a hurry.. Oh and you want your steak WELL DONE, but somehow brought out to you in the next 15 minutes... Let me call The Doctor.. because he's the only one who can possibly get your food out to you that fast.
   
  
6.) This isn't Harlem...don't do the shake. 
Look, I do work on busy nights. There's a GREAT chance that you're not my only table. So if I can't get one to you RIGHT away, just wait a few seconds. I promise I will. However, if by some chance I DO not notice at first that you need a refill, do NOT just hold your glass up and shake it at me while I'm approaching or while I'm at your table. Let me repeat... do..not..shake..your..glass..at..me.  I'm not sure you realize how insulting that is and how much it pisses a server off. Please. Just don't do it.  Don't tap it either. Not with your finger, your silverware, or anything else. Just don't.  If you need a refill and I don't notice
   
7.) Don't take your special instructions too far.  Everyone likes their food differently, they get pissy with ME. Furthermore, if you don't like it and they have to remake it, it's twice the pain in the rear.  Please, order the closest thing to what you like on the menu, and if you MUST, change one or two things.  This isn't the Build-a-Bear workshop
And to add on to this, ask for a manager and then get it for free. Screw that shit. If your steak is wrong, immediately tell me it's wrong and I'll have them make you a new one. I check on EVERY table to make sure everything is correct for them. If you tell me it's fine, then when you're done it's magically not, NOBODY believes you. The manager might comp your meal, but he and everyone else think you were just trying to screw us over.  Seriously, if your meal is wrong, then it's on you. Not us. (Last week
   
  
8.) Camping. CAMPING CAMPING CAMPING... Good gravy. Camping is never okay.  ""What is camping?"" You might ask. Let me explain. Camping is when you are finished eating, are also the ones who complain about having to wait 60 minutes for a table.  YOU are part of the problem! You wouldn't have had to wait that long if other people didn't camp. If they paid and then left to go sit and chat at a cafe or something instead, you could have been seated sooner.  So then, after complaining about your wait, you sit and chat for over an hour after you've paid, making MORE people wait... thus making the circle of complaining to me about your wait keep going on and on.   Please, if you're finished eating and you're paid
   
This rule goes for you and your ""joiners"" as well.
*Sits down*  Guest - ""Yes
Me - ""Great! Do you know about how long it will be until they arrive?""  
  
Guest - ""I'm not sure half an hour or so. Somewhere in there.""    
No no no. This is the same as camping...only the sitting and waiting is BEFORE you order, PLAN AHEAD.  Please, don't stop me from doing my job because your group either didn't plan ahead or didn't communicate very well.   And lastly on this topic, it is REALLY hard for me to do my job when you all trickle in.  Most servers HATE this. Let's say there's 20 of you. Three show up, order drinks. Five show up, order drinks, the first three order appetizers. Five more show up, continue until all 20 are here and the server is already frazzled and frustrated. Please...try to show up together.
   
  
9.) I know this is a difficult one and you don't always realize you're doing it
Again, tell me all of them. I swear I can get them all.  When I'm a ping pong ball between you and the kitchen, I can not get to my other tables, then THEY get mad at me because I haven't been to them in 5 minutes, because I've made 6 trips for you. Please, ask for a few things at once, and then give me a few minutes to check on my other guests. Then if you need more things
  
10.) Do not tell me you're ready to order if you're actually NOT ready to order.  Again
  
Me - ""Alright
Guest - ""Yeah
Me - ""And how would you like that cooked?""  
Guest - ""Medium.""   
Me - ""Alrighty
Guest - ""Oh..I didn't think of that.. Where are your sides, those all sound good. Honey, what do you think? Do I want the sweet potato? Didn't I get that last time? Those are pretty good here... How is your broccoli? Hmm..I don't know, I want something a little more filling. Is your rice pilaf spicy?  Babe, if I get a baked potato, will you split it with me?""   
  
All the while

So, because we're a ""nicer"" place, our dinners tend to be a little slower paced but with more detail (mise en place, wine pairings, etc.) Well, Canada Day is the complete opposite - it's all about the quantity. 

So here we are, but I don't think we realized it would be as crazy as it was. I didn't get a chance to even look at my watch until around 3:15. It was NUTS!!! Table after table after table after table. Not to mention, with the Canada Day menu, the table cheques were a hell of a lot less than what was normal.

We were paid okay. Some people didn't tip (tourists or people who thought they could get away with it) or tips were low (10% to 12% was the norm as people were leaving thanking us for our work saying they had a great time. Gee

Apologies all around for the wall of text to follow.

So I work at a very popular burger chain with endless fries and tacky wall decor. We tend to get a lot of traffic during the sports seasons

Tonight, a 40 top is not that unreasonable for us - I've taken a 60 top before, so anything under 40 or so is really bearable. Besides, R and I are two pretty darn good servers, so it should be fine.

This party of 40 decides that they would like to sit on the patio, the manager tells us to try to make it work. So we get extra chairs and manage to squeeze them all in. 

When they see how uncomfortable it is, whatever. 

So R and I take everyone's drink orders and get them out quickly - we manage to stay on top of refills as quick as humanly possible (which entails at least 30 lemonade refills for the children that I personally brought out). When we order the food

The food comes out in very good time, nada. Everyone is happy with their food; we check back several times to ensure that it is. I overhear an older gentleman, roughly 35-38, mention it's his birthday to someone else, and make a mental note to make him a birthday sundae as a surprise.

However, everyone is standing up and getting antsy, and it's safe to assume that, since I never offered it in the first place, they are just ready to leave.

Then the bills start coming in.

First, a gentleman who's bill was $23.03 gives me $23. When I realize what has happened, I go outside to ask him for the rest of the bills (had I shortchanged him the $.03, you bet your butt he would have asked.); alas, he has already left. So add a -$0.30 tip to the tally.

A Mr. Hot-Shot who decided to pick up a bunch of tabs left us $12 on $109. All in all

R and I split that $32, and expos a large amount. R and I made $10 each. This is during our peak, which means that we did not receive any tables we would have, and this largely was our income for the night. 

But Mr. Birthday-Boy - you really put the icing on the cake. You had the nerve to - after handing me a less than 10% tip - throw a fit because we ""don't do anything special for birthdays"". I politely told him that I had intended to bring him a birthday sundae

1365109575.0,1bor94,A little work-related rant,,37,6,10,"First off

I work in a small, I can't legally supply alcohol. There is one manager and one server who are able to get me and the other waitstaff alcohol. Keep that fact in mind. 

On to the show! 

Now, my manger asked me to clock out, which I was more than happy to do. I stuck around for a little while, as my brother (my ride home) was still on the clock. The other server, let's call him Blondie, is a bit of an ass.

Around 9PM, takes the table. He quickly tries impressing them by showing off. Imagine a toddler who's just learned a card trick; that's him. After a few minutes, the chef comes out to cook their meals. Blondie, being that kid who needs the admiration of his peers, brings out a liter bottle of saké. Just by carrying it, he's violated a few state laws. He promptly places it on the table along with 4 shot glasses. He fills them all up, and everyone at the table takes it. Now, he's consumed alcohol (since he's underage)

I followed him back into the kitchen fuming mad as well. The chef, threatening to fire Blondie for jeopardizing everyone's jobs. I leave and let Blondie know he should talk to Shrimp and, at least, apologize for his stupidity. He leaves, then returns 5 minutes later. ""Nah, he's not mad at all... He's just whining about stupid shit."" Letting him know that he's put all our jobs at risk, as there was a table of 7 beside Blondie's. If they reported him, the legal action would destroy the restaurant. ""It's fine

More examples? 

* He's cussed out my brother for not being able to take him (Blondie) to work whilst my brother was hanging with friends. 

* He took a whole week off without any advanced noticed saying he'd be out of town

* He's made quite a hostile environment by insulting me with any derogatory homosexual term you can think of. 

* He demands my brother and I get his tables their soups and salads
 
* Anytime I need a day to take off

* The kid, neglects his tables, demands we pick up his slack, and rushes all his tables just so he can talk to her. When he isn't talking to her in person, he's texting her constantly during his shift. 

* He mopes and pouts like a damn toddler if anyone of us make a few dollars more than him in tips.

* He'll call me unprofessional if I can't help him because I'm busy.

* He takes out his anger on any coworker who talks to him whenever he has more than 2 tables.

So, so I walked around putting applications in, and handing out resumes. I stumbled upon a small Chinese shop that had been there for a while, next door to the bowling alley.

I go in and tell them I have kitchen experience, but the restaurants have to have at least one person that works in the store, has to take the class or have the equivalent training via serve-safe] in the state of Michigan, (this restaurant doesn't have theirs...) and I tell them I have kitchen experience cooking and doing prep work. He tells me to come back the next day, to start work. We will call the owner Hu. His wife also works there, doing deliveries, and we will call her Ling.

The Next day

I report for my first day of work, even though I have it up in a ponytail, and sets me to my first task. which is taking the fat off the chicken and wrapping it up on large baking sheets. put them in the cooler. he sends me home. okay? So it was then I was only working 2-3 days a week, for 2 hours a day, and being paid under the table that day, at $8.00 an hour.

Fast Forward 1 week

After the first week they have me answering the phone, doing dishes. I can do all of these things, when they introduce the new task of making the Crab Rangoon. which is easy. put egg wash on 2 sides of the dough, on the very edge, fill with cream cheese, and bring the corners together. easy stuff.

After working for a week, except for the stainless steel table they did prep work on. The sinks? All they had was cold water, except for one tap that was luke warm. Last time I checked you cant do dishes in cold water for bacteria reasons, So, I set about emptying the sink, and refilling it with warmer water. when Hu comes over and asks what I'm doing. I tell him, and he says He had JUST filled the sinks with water. I tell him that you cant do dishes in cold water. Hu tells me not to worry about it, and the way he was gesturing. I sat there quietly

finally Hu comes to me and tells me I need to go home now, When he tells me he would call me before he needed me again. He never called back. So apparently I was fired for wanting to do the dishes in sanitary sink water(?)

For a while I thought about reporting the place to the Health Dept. for the way they did their dishes, but the most I ever got out of Hu about that was you had to be strong to handle the woks. What ever I don't know.

Items range from $14-$17
Includes Unlimited Coffee, Bloody Marys, and Screwdrivers.

Usually our group is 8 to 10 people.  As the only one of my group of friends who was a former server for several years I get the vibe that we are disliked.  Everybody else carries on like things are fine and service is just bad but I pick up on the signs.

First I know it's a jerk move to just roll into a place with 8 to 10 people. And after the first time we couldn't be sat because a group with reservations occupied the large table area in the back

Second, coffee and mamosa, bloody mary coffee and water)  I know this isn't too uncommon but I'm sure it's disliked.

Now my friends are a little scruffy and probably not entirely quiet.  But by no means are we rude or disruptive.  I'm pretty sure it's the refills that are annoying the servers the most. 

The check always has 18% included so our $150-160ish check becomes 170-185ish.  I usually put down another 10 or so with another friend so we generally tip about 35-40.  Somehow this doesn't seem enough for the refill service of 2-3 drinks per person.

Even though as a server I'd prefer you treat me like crap and tip very well than be nice and not tip.

Basically I always get a ""we don't like you vibe"" when we come. And feel that there's always a debate in the back over who's gonna take us.  Should we tip more for the unlimited refills? Order less drinks? Am I paranoid? I know the actions of a server that likes a table and we definately don't get it.

Our NYE nine course tasting started at 7:30.  At around 10:30

Our six top waved me over and asked if we would mind if they stayed and ordered a bottle of champagne.  We don’t mind at all.  I bring freshly polished flutes, loosen the cage, put a serviette over the cork, point the bottle at the wall, turn the bottom, and open the bottle without a pop.  Everyone’s happy.

At 11:50

I was confident from my flawless Champagne presentation earlier (and the shot of bourbon I had with the kitchen after the last course).  I am not sure what went wrong.

I do the same thing.  Flutes, serviette.  When the cork out (again, no pop), I notice something on the edge of the table where I am standing.  Then I notice my hand hurts.  And it is bleeding.  And there is blood on the lip of the bottle.

I told them the bottle was chipped and I would get them another, I could see that under the lip of the bottle there was a giant chip.  When I twisted the bottom of the bottle, the jagged edge scraped against my hand and maimed the left side of my palm.  It hurt.

The other server got them a new bottle of champagne

Any other wine service horror stories?

TL;DR

Never touch the lip of a bottle with your bare hand during wine and champagne service.

Cons: It is unprofessional
Pros: You get to drink an entire bottle of champagne by yourself after hours because it might have your DNA in it.  And the wine rep comps the defective bottle.

I work at a restaurant that is pretty much pasta only. It's not really Italian, family dining. To preface this particular story, I should note that while we are in Utah (a state with strict liquor laws) we do have a complete bar, and while customers do order drinks fairly frequently, the item I have seen sold the least is wine by the bottle. It has literally occurred twice that I've seen since I started there four years ago. This is the story of the second occasion. 

Now obviously since wine is not a large portion of our sales and I myself do not like wine

Traditionally, so I had to do this myself. I figured I had it handled, how hard could it be to open a bottle of wine? If only I had known. I arrived with their glasses and bottle, popped the top, and was about to start pouring when the man grabbed me by the arm and stopped me. Now keep in mind, at this point in time I have six other tables waiting for me to help them, so I just want to leave. Instead, took the bottle from my hand, quite frivolous, but I am still confused by his actions to this day.

Thankfully, not a chain restaurant), the managers were really rigid about certain policies they had in place to save themselves from financial loss — one of them being that if the customer didn't like the food (for reasons other than the order being mixed up) and the server didn't catch on quickly enough/replace it for them, the discount came out of the servers' pockets, rather than the kitchen staff or the restaurant paying for it.

She complained that the chicken was too dry and seemed ""petrified"". She made such a big deal of this one word, ""petrified"". I thought it was strange that she was now complaining about the food, considering she'd said nothing earlier and she had eaten pretty much all of it, and while they normally told us not to give discounts to people who ate more than 3/4 of the food and *then* complained

The next time I served her, I came back to see if they were finished and she snapped at me that they were still working on it (even though they hadn't touched any food in several minutes and were all just sitting there, looking annoyed). A bit later, as they were still sitting there with the remaining scraps of food untouched, she flagged me over and demanded that I discount their *entire* meal.

1373215858.0,1ht4ab,The Day the Hoods went down...,musicaddict737,32,5,12,"*Sorry this is long

So, because it results in essentially two rushes during dinner shift.  

Well, except for one daughter who was full-time managing their other restaurant, that I also work at.  They were scheduled to return Friday night, but at the last minute, extended their trip another day so they'd get back around closing Saturday night.  This was on top of our Saturday night bartender already having taken off this night weeks in advance for a special event in town.  This left just 3 servers up front, one who had been handed manager powers in the POS who didn't know how to use them, and zero with any true bartending experience.

Well, and as soon as I get through the door, I'm assaulted with 110 degree air and a building cloud of smoke.  All the ventilation hoods in the back were down.  They had the back door open and a fan blowing smoke out and this was still the condition of the kitchen.  Apparently, the hoods had gone down around noon, and the repairmen wouldn't show up until around 6, in the thick of our happy hour rush.  Now, to give a little perspective, a 4 burner saute station

As our rush ramped up, the server who was our ""bartender/manager"", even though she had no experience with either.  The shitty thing is, T and the other server, A, had a lot of cocktail orders.  So they were playing fuck-around at the bar literally all night, trying to figure out how to make these cocktails, you could barely see the crew on the other side of the line and it could not have been any cooler than 130 in the kitchen.  The cooks were pulling some kind of Hell's Kitchen-challenge shit where one guy would cook for 5 minutes then run out for air and the 4 of them would rotate doing that all night.

So understandably, a 2"" piece of stainless steel wok scrub left in some lady's curry, timing mistakes on apps vs. entrees, etc.  And I was the server running everything and dealing with it all.  Out of everyone, I probably spent the most time in that kitchen, on top of dealing with my own tables all night.  After the first happy hour rush, I was doing alright, just coughing a little when I stepped in the kitchen, etc

Around 8, I had a massive headache, felt physically sick to my stomach, and had several of the kitchen guys worried because every other time I stepped in to the kitchen, I was coughing up a storm.  After I dropped some lady's iPhone on the floor in front of her and got dizzy when I bent down to pick it up, I handed off the last 2 tables I was sat with off to A and T, told T what was up

I got out around 9:45, and they could see the [huge sweat-stain](http://imgur.com/sfhYE68) on the back of my shirt, but I decided to just drive home and immediately made street pizza in a bush as soon as I parked my car.  And immediately passed the fuck out for 10 hours when I got home.  

Holy fuck

1351851219.0,12iaq9,The unwanted customer,Derpy_Duckie,32,6,16,"I work in my mother's restaurant and at the young age of 17

If it's one thing that will get me to hate a customer for all of eternity, I barely finish my meals as there are no break times. This means I can start eating at 9 o'clock in the morning and finish an hour later, by that time the food has gone stone cold and no appetite left. So yes, I cherish my meals times and I will go on a raging warpath if anything interferes with it.

For this particular tale, that is a big deal because I don't get personal space at home at all, my parents enjoy barging in my room if I was too quiet and have told me off on more than one occasion for requesting to have a lock on my door. I like my personal space and I most certainly don't like it when it gets violated, be it friend or foe.

I had thought I managed to see the last of him when I told him bluntly (still as polite as I was willing to go) that I do not appreciate him touching my food and personal items. He was offended, they said, it's wrong to defend myself). He said that he's never going to return and that we have lost a valuable customer.

Months passed by and I was significantly happier without his presence and I enjoyed getting some space for myself. 

Until last night.

I was sitting down, which I closed immediately. We had a staring showdown and he was uncomfortably close to me. I was civil and polite to him for the remainder of the short conversation we had.

Him: Are you open?

Me: Yes.

Him: I want noodles.

Me: With?

Him: Duck. Noodles with duck.

Me: Okay.

I handed the order into the kitchen and had another waiter serve him while packed everything up and stayed inside the kitchen for food preparation. I told my mother that I did not feel comfortable in serving that man, a trait passed down from my brother to me.

Has anyone else have to deal with people like this?

**TL;DR: I'm not a people person and don't like strangers.**

**EDIT:** I realized I probably came off as whiny and I didn't give enough context to this situation

1. My parents get paranoid when they leave me home alone so they drag me out of the house as much as possible, but I do end up not finishing my meals most of the time.
While I have a local library nearby, these instances of OD'ing are very rare and they do get reported in the local papers but my parents see it as a good reason to not allow me to go to the library.

2. I understand that eccentric customers exists and I'm fine with that. I enjoy interacting with them and most of the time I end up being good friends with them. However, eccentric or not. This man had actually picked up my food with a grin while I was busy serving another table, presumably trying to get my attention and on the other times he had been at the place, he would stand and stare down at me for a few minutes and it's extremely unnerving for me. 

3. My parents' paranoia have stemmed from other children they had from previous marriages. My brother was a problematic child during the period when my mother was in the process of divorcing from his father, if I recall correctly) or drug use (which continues today, particularly my step-brother).
With this in mind, I no longer have a problem in terms of my laptop being tampered or taken away and I developed a habit of eating while standing behind the counter.

4. My mother's restaurant has the normal set up of the front of house, counter and the cash register. I work primarily at the front and I multitask many jobs such as serving, cleaning, being at the cash register to give customers their bills and general maintenance. We do have workers for these jobs, but my mother can't afford to pay them for long hours so I normally do them after hours before I go home. There is no back office for me to retreat to when I do need to study, nor is there designated ""break times"" for all employees. Everyone is encouraged to eat when they need to and there is no policy of having specific servers for different tables, meaning *all* servers serve different tables to cover the other when they're eating. As the owner's daughter, even if I'm technically busy. So,self,

There had been some staffing changes and none of the people we knew were on that night until we were halfway through when two of them came over to say hi.  A round or two of drinks, dinner, slide the fold to the edge of the table with the bills sticking out so she knows we are ready and we keep chatting until she comes by.  The strangest thing happens.  She circles and looks and assists every other table in our section but ours... for 45-50 minutes.

Today was Sparky's day to wait tables, and had gotten some, if not most, of my prep work done for the rest of the weekend. Out in the dining room, we have a small TV, in which the Michigan vs. Ohio State game was playing, and Sparky kept taking it upon himself to go watch TV instead of doing the one task he was given... which was sweeping and mopping the floor.  I was steddily getting pissed off

Our conversation went a little something like this:
*pudgy penguin goes out and turns the TV off*

Sparky: what are you doing?

Let me preface this by saying that I HATE being THAT customer

I got awesome service last night when I went out to a favorite burger place than can accommodate gluten allergies with my husband to celebrate the successful defense of my Master's thesis.

I like my burgers well done.  Food comes out, my husband points out that it's medium-well.  Well, fuck.  I realize rationally that there is nothing wrong with a medium-well burger.  But the pink grosses me out, and once noticed, I can't unsee it and I can't eat it.  I very apologetically ask our waiter if he can send it back so it can finish cooking.  No problem he says, and off he goes.

A few minutes later he comes back with a fresh burger and basket of fries (already more than I meant for him to do).  About to dive in again

The pattern at this point in the story is that I'm too tired and hungry to pay attention to my food, I point that the fries are seasoned and pretty sure the burger also his.  He apologizes profusely and goes back to the kitchen.  A few minutes later the chef comes out to apologize and personally deliver my burger.  

They comped my burger, but money is tight so we can't throw money around.  We still ALWAYS tip 20-25% when we go out.  But I really appreciated his attentiveness and his good attitude even though I sent my food back twice.  The chef was also wonderful and amazing.

So thanks to an amazing waiter and very patient chef a night that could have ended disastrously turned out awesome.

What are some other things I can do to help her out when I am cooking though? I do what I can, when the other girl comes back to work.

We were having this conversation on the complete other side of the room from this couple and we were looking at tables near the wall across from the couple so I wasn't really paying attention to them.  I should also mention that it has been less than 5 minutes since I got them their drinks

So mid conversation this couple stomps past us towards the door all red faced and angry.  We were both completely unaware that anything had been wrong and began to ask them if everything is okay.  They are very exasperated and say that I had been ignoring them.

So my boyfriend goes to bus the table and I grab some menus from the host stand.  When I get to the table, I had been very polite to her.  She stomps to the host stand where my boyfriend and her husband are standing and the couple demands to see a manager.

I work in a very busy restaurant/bar in a beach city. Our policy is that we do not split checks. The computer system doesn't let us and it is clearly stated in the menu. We can put  certain amounts on different credit cards though. I deal with huffs and puffs and complaints about this on a regular basis so I'm pretty immune to people getting angry about the issue.

However, I said ""Are y'all together?"" and there were noises of confirmation. At the end of the meal when I dropped off the check, one of the women, who was nice enough the entire meal, goes ""I told you we were separate!"" As she says this, she waves her fingers as to indicate the two separate parties. I immediately go into my ""our policy is we don't do separate checks"" spiel. She immediately gets angry. She claims she told me in the beginning but obviously this is not true as I stated earlier in this rant that I asked if they were together when I first approached the table. When I  started to explain that if she gives me her credit card, I can charge a certain amount to it. She cuts me off and demands a **calculator** and a pen, I thought she was going to hit me. I was so taken aback by how mean she was being to me

I returned with a calculator and pen and apologized for the miscommunication which she answered by snatching the things from my hands and sighing extremely loud.

I waited a bit and came back to see if they were done/needed any help. When I asked her, backed away slowly with my eyes wide. I have dealt with many unhappy people in my customer service career but I have never ever been given a look like that. When I was telling this story to my coworkers, I couldn't even replicate it because I do not have that much hate inside me. She looked at me like I killed her child and I was just found not guilty.

Anyway, I had to go smoke a cigarette before I finished my sidework and left.

While we are a small family owned business, our owner is always at random stores and never at the corporate office, so good luck getting a hold of him. I smiled, said okay

A couple minutes later, of course knew this would happen. The hostess said she snatched her bags and ran out of the front door. We went out after her, but she was loooong gone.

Not only was this the worst experience I've ever had at Dennys

We got there at around 11 at night, party of four, and waited. Standing room only since there was a group of like, 15 before us. Still not a problem. 
Isaac the host sat us rather quickly
20 minutes in, a water and a cherry coke. 

Oh my goodness. The three other tables that were sat after us weren't receiving any attention either. Jeremy, clearly. The other waitress (who was taking the table of 15,) had to pick up his tables. But not ours. At least 45 minutes into our time of BEING SAT, we still hasn't gotten our drinks. He finally rushes out with our shakes, ""Sorry guys, the other machine was broken and I had to make all of these,"" a diet coke and no water. 
Our food is no where on the way. He tells us it'll be right out though. It shouldn't take an HOUR and a half for our food to come out. The table of 15 was done before we got our food. The other three tables were offered apologies and they were quickly picked up by other much more capable and competent servers. 

My boyfriends food came out, but he was reminded of the original request. Cherry coke, not diet coke. They have one of those, 100+ selection machines I guess and they have like, cherry coke, diet, vanilla
Next out were two burgers. I had ordered a salad, he had to double check the dressing I wanted, which was ""whatever it comes with,"" and surprise! No bread at all. Honestly. NO chicken, lettuce, cranberries and pecans. Salad dressing in a side bowl and this took over an hour and a half?? We left Denny's at 1:30ish. 
Fucking ridiculous. Over 2 hours for 2 burgers, 3 shakes and a CHERRY coke. Our friend finally got his water but had to ask twice. 

The party of 15 was LONG gone. As well as the three tables that were sat after us. I told my boyfriend if he left any sort of tip

This occurred last year while I worked at a small café. 
	
There are many things I would love to say about Serena,” I will keep what I have to say somewhat brief (at least, within the boundaries of the section title; whatever else I have to say on her will be in other appropriate posts). 
	
Serena (let's call her) and I started working at the café around the same time. Actually, who was condescending in her own right) who’s been at the café for over five years. I don’t know if Serena thought that, because she’s friends with Beth, that means she can boss me around, but it certainly seemed that way. She would always tell me what to do, would get mad if I don’t do it, would get mad at me if I make a mistake on or with something… Oh, even though I did my job just as well as they did theirs.

Serena would also yell at me for really stupid reasons; honestly

And then the shit hit the fan when I made a stupid post about something on my facebook wall (at this point, she had the gall to accuse me of starting up “drama” and “bullshit” when in reality, it would always be her at the café going on and on about the “drama” she was dealing with in her life. 

This occurred, for which I was grateful, but she still found ways to make me miserable. I would practically have panic attacks whenever I knew she would be around. I swear, there was something wrong with Serena. She had this underlying current of anger that I could sense, and she came off (to me, at least) as unstable and power hungry. 

Finally I left and got another job at which I am MUCH happier. I have a few other stories about my time working at this café, of course).

1364871102.0,1bhn39,I couldn't even get mad because I found it so beautifully ironic.,DinerDiaries,29,8,24,"New account here!  Hi!

I work in a very busy, or lamb ala greco, or a burger at any hour.  

Diners in New Jersey most certainly always sit under a full moon.  They attract the strangest of characters.  At any given hour, awkwardly making eye contact with other patrons or wait staff, hoping for some conversation.  Here is a little tale about one of those characters.

We'll call her Alice.

Alice comes in almost daily.  She is almost always alone, never married, and probably has no children.  She often wears a peculiarly stained red polo shirt, plastic barrettes in her hair, which is graying and is often slicked back into a greasy bun.  There is something slightly off about her.  Not ""off"" in the way that people from Ohio or Alaska are slightly ""off"", but off in the way that she probably has some sort of human services visitor who helps her with things such as managing her money, cleaning her residence, and she is sweet as pie.

It's not always easy to tell these things through casual observation, no one really knows much about her.  One thing we do know: She never, ever, not once in her years of patronage, has ever left a tip.  Not. One. Red. Cent.

Under normal circumstances, we let it slide.  She's quiet, never complains, isn't demanding, doesn't talk much, and doesn't take up precious table space.  No harm, no foul.  We're not really losing anything by her presence, her presence is kind of endearing.  

As I mentioned, however, are very obviously developmentally delayed.  When they come in together, they will sit at a table, rack up at 60 dollar bill, and not tip.  They're not fussy or demanding, they're all excessively polite

Recently, and was slightly disappointed when she found that no, no one was interested in donating.  One day, while ringing her up, the manager said to her ""Well, Alice, you know, but it would probably be more enticing to them if you gave to them now and again.  Would you like to leave Melissa (name changed) a tip today?""  

[Alice winced her face in thoughtful contemplation.](http://alltheragefaces.com/img/faces/large/determined-questioning-pondering-l.png)  There were audible gasps as we thought FINALLY, shaking our heads while simultaneously chuckling to ourselves.  We exchanged our usual pleasantries as she grasped her myriad of plastic bags full of who knows what, wished her a good night, with assurance that regardless of her status as a habitual non-tipper, we'll still see her tomorrow.

1376685219.0,1kidph,Question about schedules,Yarkris,23,2,8,"Hi all. I have a question that involves some schedules. Might be a bit of a rant. 

Background: I am a Shift Manager at a chain fast-casual type restaurant. We have an open kitchen and there are several people who are trained in kitchen and front of house

Here's my concern;
My GM will make the schedule for the next week around a week in advance. Most times, not scheduling enough closers). That's fine, since I expect to have to work more than what my schedule says and can come in. 

What really gets me and I am concerned about is that after the schedule has been posted she will fix things by writing in shifts on people's schedules but never tells them. She just expects them to look at the schedule and show up. It would be one thing if she asked person A to come in and then wrote it on the schedule

She did this to my sorority sister and then wrote her up for a no-call no-show. When I asked her about it

I'm getting fed up. Is this legal?

tl;dr- my GM changes the schedule without telling anyone and gets mad when those folks don't show up for their shifts. Not sure if this is legal. Nothing in the handbook really says anything about it. ",self,t5_2v480,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/1kidph/question_about_schedules/

1376444308.0,1kbj4h,How do I go about asking for a promotion to server?,Ansareez,26,5,33,"I've been working at this restaurant for at least half a year.  I started of as a food runner. I already know most of the menu. I do need to learn the ingredients, since I sometimes help some of them with it. I have a little experience with food preparation and dish washing. I've also worked a catering event for them. I've bussed tables a couple times
l get along great with the line cooks, some of them might even like me. I'm not buddy buddy with people, but at the very least I'm not mean or anything to them. I just go in, do my work as best as I can, occasionally talk with some of the coworkers, and go home.  
The one problem I have is that I'm not exactly the most social person. I don't think this might be too uncommon based on some of the servers I've had in the past. I have a hard time showing/expressing emotions. Smiling itself is a lot of work for me. I often get told I look like I'm angry or something. Which does kind of hurt a little. But I have been working on this. This actually helped me when I worked/(kinda)managed a small store before working here. Most of the customers liked that I knew when they wanted to be left alone or just didn't feel like talking. And the customers that did want to chitchat about whatever, trying to please them as best I could. The whole unsocial thing also made me very calm and collected, so I had no trouble dealing with the unpleasant customers. Which I know might happen a lot while serving. It also makes me have a hard time pushing/selling things to customers.  
The thing is I don't know how to go about asking. Recently we lost a couple servers, I welcome it. I love working. As long as I get a day off every now and then, I'm good. Also some of the host and runners have been asking to serve. How can I make my case to make them let me serve, out of all of them?

I started at my golf course/country club workplace a year ago

**First way:** Due to my nice and please-everyone-first nature, too. I'm literally their bitch.

**Second way:** As a representative of my workplace, and so forth.. But also any other unrelated and personal topics about in-depth analyses into my life, relationships, school, etc.. and way too many personal confessions into their lives. This also brings on a lot of misinterpretation of my replies (as I'm too nice and I don't want to be disrespectful and not pretend to care or listen) and I find that 80% of the male staff have a thing for me.

**More details:** Every time I walk into my workplace, on a daily basis when I'm at work (and thankfully it's not actually daily - I go to school so I only have about 2-3 shifts a week) I get harassed by my bosses and the all-male kitchen staff, constantly hear rants upon rants from the servers and additional hostesses (on our busy buffet days), and generally am forced/have taken upon myself to take on many more job duties than I get paid for. 

Since all the servers think that their lives are horrible and this job is expendable to them (totally not, loud and rude comments they make on our management, their life troubles, 'bad' customers, and so forth. It has gotten to the point where I have to cut them off to welcome guests to our restaurant, since they ignore the fact people are walking up to my podium and continue on their ""... and it's just bullshit!"" rant or whatever. 

Not to mention that they are extremely lazy, and I get rude looks or remarks since I haven't gotten their pint of Stella or cajun chicken caesar salad yet. 

Last but not least, and it seems like they all want to form a special bond with me that allows them to talk all about their lives and then inquire on mine.. at a too-personal level most times. I have a boyfriend, and 2 or 3 months into me working at this place they finally all came to realization with this. Despite, they make inappropriate comments and just assume I'm not treated fairly by not only my boyfriend (I have never led them to believe this, in any sense) but also the people I surround myself that aren't them, such as saying things like ""You're the full package"", ""You're pretty, don't make excuses

It's very stressful for not only me but my boyfriend too, etc., but I respect my coworkers and their personal issues and social stimatisms, and I just hope I can play naive and help them beyond how other coworkers treat them - with little respect/very fake. (I'm studying Psychology, if this explains why I do this a bit better.)

This goes for telling off my lazy servers and additional hostesses too

**TL;DR: Coworkers and managers are lazy, or should I just quit?**

- - -

**EDIT:** I've been a server, hostess, busser.. you name it, in the food and beverage service industry. Prior to this job, I was at a coffee shop/cafe for 5 years where I did most of the above jobs, and was affected by the same issues in my current position but to a lesser degree (until the last year before I quit). 

I've also been a receptionist as well as a real estate agent assistant, then harassed me daily until I quit. 

So yeah, and I assume that similar things will happen in the future too. So I'm not so naive, but moreso realistic. 

As far as my current position goes, I agree with you all: I **need** to take affirmative action, through means of either ignoring/walking away from coworkers when they are inappropriately talking or complaining, and also not let the management rule over me and harass me too.

I was recently promoted to management within my company. I poured almost seven years of my life into this company- and I love everything about it. The staff is great

Just so that you understand the background a little bit more I feel like I have adapted to management really well

I was always a leader within my stores and have always had a lot of drive, especially since I have become a management member, I have tried my best to work on my tone, my patience, and my attitude in general. 

As with any human being though
I can't tell you how hard it is

It doesn't help that against better judgement I was moved to a store that I was previously a server, etc at, so I do not necessarily automatically get the respect that one might expect. 

Anyway, I had to pick up someone else's work who was on vacation- and I had never done that before, I have been stressing out about being as good as they thought I was in training (which is downright silly, I realize, since now I am doing the real job), I finally just yesterday moved all of my stuff out of my old city and said goodbye, and not 1 but 2 people complained to my GM about me. 

I was crushed. All this hard work I put in, my old store, trying my very best every day, working with people who knew me from before and I wish would remember that I am just me and not some super scary manager just because I am mad, and hearing that people hate my guts just did me in. 

It was clear that I was upset and torn to pieces. Out brand new server, and a red bull just so I could get through the rest of my close shift. :) 

It made me remember that people really do like me for who I am

Background: 23/F I work at a small local chain café style restaurant. I shall now refer to it as Cluck n Feed (a nickname my roommates father coined). I have been working there for almost two years now and have been recommended to become a new manager for our fifth location that is being rebuilt after a fire. 

Story: About two weeks ago I filed a sexual harassment complaint against two members of the Kitchen staff. I shall call them Micro and Gordo. Micro is short and everyone thinks he’s gay, rubbing my arms, etc) I don’t know anymore. Gordo has been touching me the same way. I see nothing wrong with hugs or little touches like on the shoulder or hi5s. But this was crossing the line touching. I’ve told them both to stop touching me over and over but to no avail. It finally got to the point where I had no choice but to talk to my manager. I told him (we shall call him Tweedle Dee) and the GM (Tweedle Dum) at the same time so that they can’t pretend like I didn’t say anything.

In our employee handbook it said that if you report anything like that, right? Now they know I said this about them.
I was scheduled to work this past Thursday night and my boss wanted me to close the restaurant by myself with Micro and Gordo working the kitchen. I told Tweedle Dee that I was uncomfortable working by myself with them so he was nice enough to change my shift so that I would work til 830. The one who was supposed to close

When I told Tweedle Dee that I didn’t want to do that , and running food. Everytime I go back to the Kitchen they stop talking and just stare at me. Needless to say I’m really uncomfortable. They aren’t giving me food tickets or sides that I ask for. Basically ignoring me.

At one point I have a line and I’m trying to get everything done. There’s food on the line and they are ringing the pick up bell nonstop. I finally have time to grab the food (it’s probably been sitting there for 2 minutes) and they start yelling at me saying I’m bad at my job and that if the foods cold it’s my fault and I have to remake it. I finally snap and tell them to shut up. After that they start throwing the plates of food onto the line. Basically slamming it down being really loud. 

They start calling me stupid

I’m hungry

For the rest of the night I didn’t talk to them. My manager ran all the food and basically dealt with the kitchen for the rest of the night. 
I could go to HR and complain but the kitchen staff could get away with murder. Complaining once just made things worse and I’m dreading going back to work tomorrow. I don’t know what to do. Should I quit? Should I just stick it out? Advice?

TL;DR: Sexually harassed by kitchen staff. Complained. Now being bullied by kitchen staff. Quit or stay?

And I will say to the manager staff on the way in ""Were we busy last hour?"" and they just say ""no this is just from the day"". I don't understand why they can't just wash a few trays or wipe the counter down or stock a few forks just so I don't spend the first hour of my shift trying to get things clean AND serve customers. Once, I came in my station was a mess because no one cleaned anything up or stocked between cashier shifts. The first 10 minutes into my shift, my manager wanted me to clean the huge stack of trays first coz we were almost out, and then out of fucking nowhere, knives

We also don't get raises or promotions. I work with my dad at this job, but what's the point if I feel like I have nothing to work toward? I mean, I'm not trying to make a career in mall pizza, but it would be nice if I could get a little reward for my hard work, ya know? I close literally every shift and I don't even get good closing hours, but I don't complain (at least not to them) Like today, I worked 6-9, that's basically them saying to me

Another thing they do that REALLY pisses me off is that they always leave before the are scheduled to. Hours have been short lately even with school being out, the managers have three. The lazy asst manager always tries to call me in on Wednesdays, which is the ONLY day that me and my boyfriend both have off and I have told them time and time again that I will not come in on Wednesdays, they don't even really need me, they just want to go home.

Me: ""Good evening

Me: ""...yes."" Yup. This is going to be fun.

Girl: ""Do you sell gorillas?!""

Me: ""Really? No.""

Girl: ""Will you be my best friend?!""

Me: ""You're either going to order something or you're going to hang up right now and stop tying up my phone lines. How's that?""

I heard a small squeak on the other end of the phone and 10 seconds of silence before she hung up. I don't get paid to entertain bored kids and she could've been way more creative with the call. Probably would've different if she was actually funny.

Also, every single one of these customers were irritable when I didn't provide them with free breadsticks immediately upon being seated., and when I had to charge for Alfredo sauce. And also snarled at me like I was cheating them for not putting cheese on their side salads, which they did not request before I made and brought the salads out. Of course I happily provided cheese for the salads, and breadsticks for free(but charge for the alfredo because I had to) and met every request cheerfully and in a timely manner. I even had one guy compliment my service. Right before he magnanimously tipped me $5 on a $65 dollar check. The next table had ten people wh split the bill 3 ways to avoid the automatic 18% gratuity, obviously. One section tipped me 5 on a 60 dollar total, one guy tipped me a dollar (actually 77 cents) on 30 bucks worth of food and liquor, who tipped me 4 off of 40 dollars. They also complained that the meat on the burgers for their kids wasn't done (it was medium well but they insisted it was undercooked; I did not argue

So basically, made the rare acquaintance of someone who will tip normally or even very well, but again, the overwhelming majority of black people I've ever waited on were this way. This isn't the first that I've noticed it, but this is the first night I've had when 90% or so of my customers were black so it was very apparent to me. 

I should also note that I'm not a white boy myself

I don't think that people saying ""I only tip for exceptional service"" is remotely acceptable. We make 2.13 an hour. And I mean, because they very proudly and friendly-like handed me the tip money or charge slip with the adjusted total.

I'm sorry about the rambliness of this post but I'm rather stoned right now. I am just genuinely curious about why this is?

1360108740.0,17yrli,"Five stores, five years, never again.",cherryCheeseSticks,27,3

I probably have more

* Worked for a local place. The head cook was a literal psychopath. Someone dropped a dish once, stomping feet. It got to the point where every time I rang in an order, I'd have a miniature panic attack for the next five minutes, until enough time passed and I could be certain I'd not made a mistake. I think I made it there 3 months before I quit.

* Worked for a chain place. Coworker was usually very nice, it did not matter that it was slow as shit and you were leaning on a counter. She'd hipcheck you to get you to move. Never an ""excuse me"" or anything of the sort. Use your mouth, woman, you're like 40 years old.

* Same chain place as above. A girl who was on a few different sorts of medicines for mental issues came in after having a dosage tweaked or a medicine changed, getting the weirdest looks from customers. My manager let this go on for *three and a half hours* on a dead-ass Sunday before he let her go home (and only because I pointed out customers were getting really weirded out by it). I felt so bad for this girl: everyone probably thought she was a drug addict, when it was her legal meds/dosage changing. D:

* Was delivering tray full of deserts to a party. Had another large party. As I'm leaning over the table to set the deserts down, startled, and dump the fucking tray all over this table. Kid got coffee on him (thankfully our coffee was never more than lukewarm -- could have been really bad if it was hot), desserts all over floor. Cleaned up and rushed around trying to remake the desserts: couldn't attend to my other party at all (this place had horrible teamwork; couldn't ask anyone for anything). Turns out the other party wanted *napkins,* and the lady who screamed at me had the gall to be pissed I took so long to come back and check on them. Thankfully, the rest of that party treated her like a crazy person for it, so.

* Had this couple: super nice, mashed potatoes? I don't have the best hearing to begin with, and loud dining room plus similar-sounding dishes. She said -- ""Why would the kitchen put two starches? WHY? WHO ORDERS TWO STARCHES?"" and was essentially acting like it was The End of the World. Suddenly, super nice couple becomes the most condescending pair of assholes I've ever met. No more niceness, just snarky comments and stony stares. Oookay. She cuts into her chicken and it's rubbery. Offer to get her a new plate? NOPE. Suddenly, even though there's nothing wrong with the husband's meal, he shoves it away from himself and ""can't eat because his wife's meal is ruined."" Comped the meal, I ended up with $1. The food industry: because you deserve to have your pay docked over a mishearing and something completely out of your control!

* Had a family of four. I'm walking past their table with dishes from another table, I realize this is the same couple plus daughters (see edit) as the above pair of assholes whose double starch on the woman's meal was The Dining Apocalypse. Fuck you, Goldman family.

* Store closed. It's 12:03. I am counting my cash for the night. People knock at the front door, etc. She makes me take the table. The people tried to order an appetizer; I threw all of their food in at once and was raging up and down the kitchen. The guests probably heard me, but honestly, whatever. I wasn't even mad at *them*, I was mad at my dumb-as-hell manager who thought it was totally cool to let people in after closing. Did not help that this was on one of those $40, seven-hour-Sundays and I just wanted to go *home*. I think that night when everything was done, I just walked out (was supposed to double check with the manager that all was done). I think she tried to say something to me the next shift and I just blew her off.

* Had a GM who hired his cousins as busboys. Said GM always ate a porterhouse steak right next to the host stand, and the other was subsequently fired when a customer viewed him dipping his cleaning rag into a glass of drinking water and using that to clean the table.

* Middle of MOTHER'S DAY RUSH, for reals). Singles out one server in particular because he was the newest. Said server goes something like, ""I don't need to hear this as much as you need me to stay and keep working."" Didn't shut him up, but at least he left the new guy to his job. Seriously, who stops everyone during that kind of rush to yell about silverware being tossed. It was doubly stupid because none of the forks were even lost, just stuck to the magnet.

* Gave a lady a ""ginger ale"" (sprite with splash of pepsi -- 95% of people can't tell the difference and it was better than waiting 10 minutes for the bartender to fetch real ginger). She said it didn't taste right; I went to fetch real ginger and brought it back. We had glasses with actual glass, the seat. She *flips her shit* and starts accusing me of purposefully dumping ginger ale on her because she asked for a replacement. Lady, I wouldn't want to ginger you over something that stupid that was my fault anyway, and besides -- if I wanted to ginger you, I would have gingered you, not the table and your stupid purse. She escalates to the point of ""WHO IS GOING TO DRY CLEAN MY SHIT"" at my manager. At one point, someone had brought her a linen to clean up. She uses it, stiffs me on the tip

My mother owns her own restaurant and my brother and I work without pay in return for being fed well


**The story:**

Now, long term friends and acquaintances of my mother. They're actually very sweet, kind and hardworking women who have been through hardships while raising children. My mother didn't realize this in the beginning, when she asked them to help her out as employees, just how quickly they got along with each other and that they adapted to the busy pace of working in a restaurant (they haven't worked in one for more than a decade or so). Delighted at the strong teamwork between her staff, my mother was lenient on their socializing when they're on the clock. My mother even encouraged us all to each together as a big family during lunchtime when the customer rush was over and yeah, it was pretty much effective team bonding with everyone over the table.

Despite this, keeping updated with each other and whatnot, so she didn't say anything about it. Fast forward two years later, we've been getting complaints from customers about slow service and how it took them such a long time to be seated. We started to lose customers and the customers we've managed to keep were becoming grouchier each visit. My mother at first blamed my brother for the slow service, who in turn blamed me because I was there with him. In the end, my brother got fed up and said to me:

""Derpy_Duckie

I didn't understand what he meant at first, I serve them. More often then not, we've managed to cut the time the workers spent in the kitchen by half and they're being productive once more. 

Until my knees started to hurt.

My mother by this time started cutting hours due to us losing business and I started taking up more responsibilities to ease the burden on my mother. She is also trying to make sure that the workers are socializing at the appropriate times and also at the appropriate place. By now, they still socialize in the kitchen but they'll quickly (and sometimes halfheartedly) finish whatever task they've been assigned to avoid being told off. I now spend an hour or so after closing time fixing mistakes and doing extra cleaning so that we wont get in trouble with our local council when they're doing random inspections on us.

Looking for a more lucrative serving gig in our wonderful city landed me a position at a downtown slow food / craft cocktail restaurant. Amazing menu, casual fun atmosphere, and clientele of service industry folks, young professionals, and downtown professionals. Earning potential given the location and people I know who have serving gigs around there is about $3.5k-$4k / month. I can tell this will be a FUN and lucrative endeavor. The owner is already looking for a location for a second restaurant so they are definitely doing well. 

So obviously I want to accept this offer. I put in my two weeks notice at my college campus job. The next day my boss tells me he doesn't want to lose me, which includes a raise (about an extra $500/month), vacation pay, health insurance, etc and I can be in charge of hiring, scheduling, and have more influence in the general scheme of things. The pay raise is not super great, would enjoy the responsibility, short term gains are paltry

1368314340.0,1e5kjv,Couple at my bar nearly punched me in the face for being polite...,Fueledbyleslie,17,1,13,"So

I was working the lunch shift at a very busy sports bar in my area, as I am every lunch.  this couple sits at my bar,  he looks about 30-35 and she is definitely in her late 50's early 60's.  They order some sammiches and a couple beers, and once I see her beer is nearly empty I say ""Can I get you another beer, ma'am?""  

Now, but I'm such a creature of habit that I forgot to mention her name because I was getting into my peak hour when I get super busy and are just doing circles around the bar. 

She looks at me with this face of disgust, ""Ma'am?  does she look like a ma'am?  what the fuck?""  

Obviously, I was just being polite. (Florida or not, I'm in the south and I know how to be courteous) He doesn't see this as a fitting response and begins yelling at me.

I said ""SIR, I was not doing anything other than simply asking for a refill on her beer.  If you have a problem with the way I've adressed it you can go ahead and speak to my manager.""

""Well

""Okay sir, and you can kindly sign it and get out of my bar. It doesn't matter to me how many times you call me that, I won't take offence to it like you obviously have because it shows that you have some type of manners.  Too bad it isn't the case in this situation. thanks and have a good day."" and didn't even bother to look back at them again.


Unbelievable.  It became more clear to me the longer that conversation went that they were a couple

TL;DR people are fucking neanderthals sometimes.

the past few months there were some management guys from a 4 * hotel restaurant across the street that would come in after their shift to have a few beers and chill. they would obviously see me run the 18 table floor by myself very efficiently. i won't lie, do their thing. they joke about stealing me from my moms place to go work for them. they bring in the exec chef and a pm floor manager to watch me work (without even introducing them to my mother and her boyfriend [who's the chef] who were both on the floor. obviously the two original guys knew my mother from coming in so often and being 'neighbors').

so push comes to shove and i was temporarily fired from my moms place (yes

so i go, but then again i'm not some random kid who never carried a plate in his life. i basically grew up in this. and the money is not what he told me it would be. my bills didnt drop in price because my paycheck is lower.

I want to clarify that this particular story is of our (the restaurant staff) fault and we have taken every measure possible to rectify it for the customers involved.

A few months prior to this story


Fast forward a few months when this incident took place. I had just gotten to the restaurant when a very angry woman confronted me.

Woman: I am very unhappy with the service I received today

Me (extremely confused): I'm sorry that you were not satisfied

Woman (in a loud voice): You cannot charge me for an extra two leaves of lettuce! This is not acceptable! You are nothing more but thieves targeting people under the guise of operating a restaurant. I will report you to the council and to the police.

Me: I'm sorry? Can you explain to what happened?

Woman: Forget it. Give me my bill now.


So I gave her the bill and immediately I turned to my co- worker

I asked V what happened.

Me: What happened? Why are we charging that table for two leaves of lettuce?

V: I thought they ask two plates or lettuce. You mum said charge them for two plates of lettuce.

Me: They asked for two leaves.

V: I know

The lady and her friends were still in the restaurant

Me: I'm really sorry about this

Woman's friend: I expected better from this restaurant. You cannot just go around charging people for things that should be free.

Me: It wasn't our intention to charge you

Woman's friend: Yeah well it's not enough. What will be enough is if you closed down

Me: Again

Woman's friend: Whatever. (Get's up and leaves)


I will admit that this was the restaurant's fault and my mother didn't know what was happening as she was in the kitchen helping the cooks making the food. Under no circumstances have I ever thought that this was not our fault. I have spoken to V about this and after telling my mother what has happened, were quite justified in being upset at the thought of being charged for something so trivial as two leaves of lettuce.

I noticed that her table consisted of two younger guys. They were drinking beers

After awhile, so he turned to the TVs. 

This is where things start to go downhill. Whenever she would come by to check on their drinks or see if they needed anything at all, so she finally explains where his logic is off, giggles, and goes off to do some sidework.

This happened last Thursday.

So at my restaurant we have a thing where once a week we're required to work a 'utility' shift, I don't mind it normally. However, after a year you're supposed to no longer have to do this, and I had been working there for a year and several months. I go in for my utility shift on Thursday morning, hoping to get out of it, thankfully I get lucky and there's actually eight food runners there for that day! We only need six at the max, especially for a Thursday day shift, our shift manager, and bussers to begin doing opening duties. I ask him if he thinks he'll need me today

I get ignored for the next hour. Eleven o'clock rolls around (When we open) and I'm still sitting by the shift board, asking if two of them came in. They had not. Alex then goes, ""Well I guess I could use Archblargh there...""

For a bit of background: I've never bussed there, but have never been assigned to bus (Nor is it a utility shift duty). Naturally, I point this out to him, ""Alex, I've never worked as a busser before... There's runners that know how to do it..."" To which he just throws it back in my face with ""Now is a great time to learn!""

He then begins writing my name on the board as being a busser for one of the rooms. I'm pretty upset at this point, I would have been fine with it.

I protest again, I've had to work people in express (Our to go kitchen), as bussers, or wherever else we need people. They've never complained!"" The aforementioned I've seen happen, and it's always been with people who previous worked those before becoming servers, and/or the people complained so that's just clearly untrue. I'm very upset at this point, both at being forced into bussing, as well as the fact that there are people who know how to that would be much better suited to it. To avoid arguing at this second

While I'm waiting by the office for him again (He is down in the kitchen talking to someone), comes up and asks me if I'm all right. I explain what happened, and he says he doesn't care, he'll bus if I'd rather run. Alex then comes back up the steps and says to the other runner, ""John, we're actually gonna have to send you home, we've got too many runners."" all while avoiding making eye contact with me.

He then goes to erase John's name from the board

That didn't go over well. he retorts back with ""Archblargh, you are not a manager."" I've now tipped over from upset to extremely angry. Anyone who knows me will say how hard it is to get me angry, truly angry, and I was absolutely furious at that point. I start arguing with him, pointing out that 1) I'm not even supposed to be here in the first place, 2) I have no idea how to bus, 3) John even said he was willing to bus and would rather stay

He finally just goes, go upstairs and start bussing."" John looks at me in shock, while I just tell him to go ahead, I'll figure this out. To summarize the rest of it, I end up getting written up for ""refusal to work my shift"" (What?) and I'm currently suspended until I speak with the manager in charge of servers about 'getting my utility taken off, that's not my job to deal with it.' (Despite pointing out that while I understand he has no control over the shift on the schedule, he had full control over this entire situation.)

I'm at a loss as to what to do. I started to go in yesterday to speak with the owner about this incident

What do you think I should do? File a complaint with the owner? Suck it up and just speak with my server manager?

i was tired of waiting for her so I went up the counter and got me some napkins.  Who do I see? My waitress

My story involves a group of 11; four adults and five kids. It appeared to be two families going out to eat together, but there was a lot of potential for error that I overcame. If I could imagine their three biggest (and probably only) complaints against me, I'd say 

(1) I couldn't invent a menu item specially for them because the kitchen wouldn't let me

(2) One side dish was ""incorrect"" because the guy couldn't properly read off the menu

(3) ""Missing"" a salad because the kids took the wrong one
