The drive to organize a Stephen Colbert rally continues to snowball. Over
5
that it's not just another lame Internet petition.

See,
one minute and doesn't demonstrate much effort. So the rally movement has been looking
for ways to show that they're serious
to make this happen. And an idea has just been hatched: pony up some cash to one of
Stephen's favorite charities.

Stephen Colbert is a board member of a non-profit called DonorsChoose.org. It's
a place where schoolteachers can make a request for the supplies they need
and aren't getting. As the name suggests
teacher they want to support (lazy donors can just let the charity decide). If ""Restore
Truthiness"" can raise a large sum of money
strength. And even if it fails as a publicity stunt
difference in our world.

Speaking of stunts
this cause: [Hillary Clinton's
been helping DonorsChoose raise money since
2008](http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/164383/march-19-2008/pennsylvania-primary).

We've been getting a lot of questions about the DDoS that happened recently. Frankly there aren't many juicy bits to tell. We also have to be careful on what we share so that the next attacker doesn't have an instruction booklet on exactly what is needed to take reddit down. That said


* The attack started at roughly 0230 PDT on the 19th and immediately took the site down. We were completely down for a period of 50 minutes while we worked to mitigate the attack.

* For a period of roughly 8 hours we were continually adjusting our mitigation strategy

* The attack had subsided by around 1030 PDT

* The mitigation efforts had some side effects such as API calls and user logins failing. We always try to avoid disabling site functionality

* The pattern of the attack clearly indicated that this was a malicious attempt aimed at taking the site down. For example

* At peak the attack was resulting in [400

* Even when serving 400k requests a second

* The attack was sourced from thousands of IPs from all over the place(i.e. a botnet). The attacking IPs belonged to everything from hacked mailservers to computers on residential ISPs.

* There is no evidence from the attack itself which would suggest a motive or reasoning.

**&lt;conjecture&gt;**

I'd say the most likely explanation is that someone decided to take us down for shits and giggles. There was a lot of focus on reddit at the time, without any clear evidence from the attack itself we can't say anything for certain.

**&lt;/conjecture&gt;**


On the post-mortem side, but we can be more prepared.

we're invulnerable to all possible present and future attacks (lest we attract unwanted attention from bored geniuses)

Now
to spell out very clearly a number of things you should already know:

1. We know of no company that can successfully manipulate
reddit, and removed from the site.
2. If you pay a company to game reddit for you
you're a sucker and you're throwing your money away. Not only will it not work
3. If you try to sell your vote to such a company
might not actually get paid. (""Oh

*me* fairly!"")
4. If we catch you attempting to cheat
you may find your reddit experience... degraded.

Our primary goal is to make advertisements on reddit as useful and non-intrusive as possible. We take great pride in the fact that reddit is one of the few sites where people actively disable ad blockers. reddit does not allow animated or visually distracting ads

We've started to turn on Adzerk in a few subreddits like /r/funny and /r/sports, but Adzerk does provide us some really cool features. For example, if you dislike a particular ad in the sidebar, it is now possible to hide it from showing again. If you hover over a sidebar ad in /r/sports, a new ""thumbs up"" / ""thumbs down"" overlay will appear. If you ""thumbs down"" an ad, we won't display it to you again, and you can give us feedback to improve the quality of reddit ads in the future.

Think of multireddits as collections of subreddits that you discover or create &amp;mdash; a custom front page of reddit for any topic / interest / state of mind. Multis can be tools to aggregate your favorite networks of subreddits or to showcase a variety of different perspectives.

And, quick [brain candy subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/user/chromakode/m/candy) and longer form [interesting subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/user/chromakode/m/interesting).

Any multis you create and set as public will appear on the sidebar of your user page. You can share them by URL or by referencing the name in comments like this: /u/reddit/m/redditpets. You can also easily discover multis by browsing /r/multihub

If you're signed in

Today is only the first step for multireddits; there's many more tools and features that we'd like to add in the future. We have some really cool beta tests coming up for the following improvements:

 * /u/shlurbee and /u/ketralnis have been working on automatic suggestions for which subreddits to add to your multi.
 * /u/bsimpson and I have been exploring adding controls to weight the prominence of subreddits in your multis differently.

You can try out these features first and support new development by subscribing to reddit gold. Keep an eye on /r/multibeta

Big thanks to Prof. Chomsky for sharing so much of his time with our community!   

Make sure you watch [Prof. Chomsky's question BACK to the reddit community](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke6YXjaZ9HY#t=29m35s) 

**Notes:**

Prof. Chomsky answers the top 3 questions in this 30 minute interview. He has said he will try to answer another 5 via email, so there is no promise he will be able to get to these.  

Midway through the interview the laptop behind Professor Chomsky goes into screensaver mode and an annoying word of the day type thing comes on. This is MY laptop

This interview took a month to publish. This is not really acceptable

3. [BerserkRL](http://www.reddit.com/user/BerserkRL/)   
Question: Although as an anarchist you favour a stateless society in the long run, because it's needed as a check on the power of large corporations. Yet the tendency of a lot of anarchist research -- your own research most definitely included, though I would also mention in particular Kevin Carson's -- has been to show that the power of large corporations derives primarily from state privilege (which, together with the fact that powerful governments tend to get captured by concentrated private interests at the expense of the dispersed public, would seem to imply that the most likely beneficiary of a more powerful state is going to be the same corporate elite we're trying to oppose). If business power both derives from the state and is so good at capturing the state, why isn't abolishing the state a better strategy for defeating business power than enhancing the state's power would be?

To get an idea of what sort of people we're looking for

----

**Quick facts**

* Unlike last summer's opening
* They will come with all the standard benefits
* :( We still can't sponsor H1-B's (You have to be legally able to work in the United States already)
* The position is at Reddit HQ in San Francisco [[map](http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=reddit%20hq&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=520+3rd+St, but these are definitely not telecommuting positions)

----

**How to apply**

Usually the first step of an application process is to solicit resumes. Candidates are forced to boil years of work down to a few bullet points

And then *we* have to read through hundreds of resumes and cover letters (even though the very fact that we're hiring means we have a big backlog of other stuff that needs to get done) and pass them around and scratch our heads

Instead of *first* doing all that, we're not yet interested in your resumes or cover letters or references or GPAs. We'll address that if you survive to the second stage; the first thing we want to do is narrow it down to the hackers. 

So we've prepared two challenges. They both reflect real-world problems that we've had to solve -- one at the beginning of reddit's existence, someone who hates having to touch the mouse and who might be allergic to CSS.

Pick the one that best suits your talents and see if you can tackle it. **Don't do both.**

----

**Frontend challenge**

We want you to build a reddit clone entirely in HTML
localstorage, and it's fine for it to be single-user. In fact, we want to leave as much of this challenge open to  interpretation as possible.

The goal here is to show off your ability to make a slick website, spam, cheating, or even making it browser-portable. If there's some really neat thing that you need Javascript list comprehensions for, or your textareas look best with `-moz-border-style:chickenfeet`, go ahead and use it. We'll defer the drudgery of cross-browser testing and compatibility hacks for when you're on the payroll; for now, just tell us what OS and browser to use (within reason) and that's the one we'll use to judge your work.

----

**Backend challenge**

Like all websites

    Feb 10 10:59:49 web03 haproxy[1631]: 10.350.42.161:58625 [10/Feb/2011:10:59:49.089] frontend
    pool3/srv28-5020 0/138/0/19/160 200 488 - - ---- 332/332/13/0/0 0/15 {Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; 
    Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.7) Gecko/20100713 Firefox/3.6.7|www.reddit.com|
    http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/?count=75&amp;after=t3_fiic6|201.8.487.192|17.86.820.117|}
    ""POST /api/vote HTTP/1.1"" 

We often have to find the log line corresponding to an event -- a ""you broke reddit"" or a weird thing someone saw or to investigate cheating. We used to do it like this:

    $ grep '^Feb 10 10:13' haproxy.log &gt; /tmp/extraction.txt

But as traffic grew, check the results."" Then it was, ""run the command, read all today's rage comics, check the results."" When it got longer than *that*, we realized we needed to do something.

So we wrote a tool called `tgrep` and it works like this:

    $ tgrep 8:42:04
    [log lines with that precise timestamp]
    $ tgrep 10:01
    [log lines with timestamps between 10:01:00 and 10:01:59]
    $ tgrep 23:59-0:03
    [log lines between 23:59:00 and 0:03:59]

By default it uses `/logs/haproxy.log` as the input file

Most importantly, checking timestamps and doing an interpolative search until it finds the range you're looking for.

For this challenge, `Feb 10 10:52:39` and also that each log contains a single 24-hour period, plus or minus a few minutes. In other words, there will probably be one midnight crossing in the log, but never more than one. The timestamps are always increasing -- we never accidentally put ""Feb 1 6:42:17"" after ""Feb 1 6:42:18"". And our servers don't honor daylight saving time, so you can ignore that whole can of worms. [Edit: you asked for a script to generate a sample log, so [we wrote one](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/fjgit/reddit_is_doubling_the_size_of_its_programming/c1ge0ri).]

You can use whatever programming language you want. (If you choose Postscript

1. It has to give the right answer
2. It has to be fast. During testing, give us the big-O analysis of the typical case and the worst case)
3. Elegant code is better than spaghetti

----

**Final points**

* When you're ready to submit your work
* We'd like all the submissions to be in by Tuesday
* Regardless of which project you pick, after all!
* Graduating college seniors are welcome to apply: for an amazing candidate
* Some of you might be thinking, it's supposed to be fun. If you don't see the joy in either of these puzzles, please don't apply. And second, we're not expecting anyone to spend weeks on this, or even days. We aimed to make the challenges something that could be put together in a weekend by the sort of programmer we're looking for. And these people *do* exist -- [this guy](http://www.reddit.com/comments/b0a2z/a_reddit_clone_in_two_evenings_and_666_lines_of/?sort=top) wrote a reddit clone in *assembly* over the course of two evenings with a *dip[ ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zshdZJnD-4I#t=1m26s)pen.* Okay, not with a dip pen.

(Here's the book [""Reign of the Dead""](http://www.amazon.com/Reign-Dead-Len-Barnhart/dp/0595297218?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=reddit2-20) he mentions).

4. Virtualmatt  
Why do you think that, True Blood, etc.), while men seem to be enthralled by Zombies? In your mind, what is behind this dichotomy of living-dead interest?  
EDIT with a better, thinks (in general) of the whole Vampire phenomenon in current pop culture.

5. Frothyleet  
Have you had any experiences with crazy people obsessed with zombies coming to you for advice?

With the increasing prevalence of the internet in providing
communication
Neutrality not being championed by this administration as a First
Amendment right? I don't see what benefit the citizens of America get
by having someone at the gateway controlling what we read and write
and I'm really quite flabbergasted that our elected representatives
seem to be leaning towards siding with large corporations and their
profit motives instead of unrestricted access to information for the
people of this country.  
Thank you for coming on here and answering our questions

would you be able to answer this:  
Do you feel that the January hacking of Google and other high-level

happened on DoD equipment and isn't going to happen in the future?

Wired has traditionally been a magazine geared towards technology, but the popularity of Danger Room suggests a growing trend in media moving outside of their traditional markets and into more ""niche"" categories.

As a journalist for the progressive Washington Independent, and the denial of habeas corpus rights to non-Afghan detainees held at Bagram. In your new position at non-political Wired, it seems as though the focus has moved towards military technology, tactics, and organization.

[Adam Savage from Mythbusters answered your top 10
questions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8jqea8R-bE). Since then
we've published almost 20 video interviews with various illustrious
individuals.  Thank you all for the interviewee suggestions and
feedback
the interviews!

As we start on year two
as collaborators
transparent. We created [r/redditvideos](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditvideos) to
discuss upcoming AMA video interviews as well as other video projects
like [reddit IRLs](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/bi1pc/reddit_pax/).
Subscribe to [r/redditvideos](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditvideos) to find out about
upcoming interviews
the public,
or other professional.  The majority of these interviews were either
recorded by one of the 5 reddit admins or by the interviewee
themselves. We think this lightweight and informal approach keeps our
interviews ""honest and unbuttoned"" as recent interviewee Peter Straub
[said](http://twitter.com/peterstraubnyc/statuses/8889470659). We want
to do more interviews and we want to keep increasing the quality of
the ones we do while keeping them ""honest and unbuttoned"". Even if we
had a budget to hire professionals (we don't)
all the work was done by redditors. If you are you a videographer
animator, or other professional that could
help us out
[HERE](https://leaptec.wufoo.com/forms/reddit-creators/) (link goes to
form on Wufoo). We really appreciate all the technical and
non-technical feedback so far
collaborators going forward.

We've already had redditor and professional motion graphics designer
juicestain [contribute an awesome animated
intro](http://www.juicestain.com/?p=249) for the interviews. We still
need sound design for the intro
elements. We also need redditors to shoot interviews that wouldn't be
feasible for one of us to do. We have had to say no to some awesome
interview opportunities because we just couldn't get to the city where
it was going down. Next time
you to help take advantage of that opportunity. We have some exciting
interviews lined up with outstanding people you've heard of
also want to starting having reddit interview non-famous
interesting people (a local traffic cop
shipping facility
your help to do that. We don't have budgets right now
offer credits, references, and character witnesses
at pending trials for any collaborators. Let us know about your skillz
[here](https://leaptec.wufoo.com/forms/reddit-creators/) or just
subscribe to [r/redditvideos](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditvideos) and keep an eye
out for stuff in your area or field of expertise (you'll also get to
see amazing behind the scenes gems like

[Intelligence Squared](http://www.intelligencesquared.com)

Speaking for the motion are the sports journalists Tom Bower, a presenter on Al Jazeera Sport, is chairing the debate.

Is the World Cup the greatest event in the sporting calendar or will it just be an orgy of WAGs and hooliganism? Do fans find meaning and fellowship on the terraces or are they just being exploited by global brands and dodgy billionaires?  Is the sport itself uniquely aesthetically pleasing or is it stagnant and dull?  The speakers will be giving their points of view and this is your opportunity to tackle them on the crucial issues.  

The event will be live-streamed on [www.intelligencesquared.com/live](http://www.intelligencesquared.com/live) and will also be available on iPhones at [http://mobile.livestation.com](http://mobile.livestation.com).  Watch and have your say through comments below.  

For the second consecutive event, which will be livestreamed online then available on-demand on [Youtube](http://mobile.livestation.com) and [iTunes](http://www.itunes.com/podcast?id=350343972).   

So it's over to you - Ask them anything!
