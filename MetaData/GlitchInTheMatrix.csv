Once my mother was having a nap in the afternoon and heard my brother calling her

On another occasion, and he told us he dreamt of his older brother, and that he said to him that they would meet soon and not to worry. The fact is that we hadn't told to my grandfather that his brother died only few days earlier. My grandfather died a week later.

A really scary things is that for a couple of months after the death of my grandfather I kept dreaming of him, he was happy. The last time he said he really had to go, but that we would have met again in about (and here I can't remember clearly) 20-30 years. I was 15, now I'm 31. I haven't dreamt of him anymore since.

When I was younger I usually had vivid deja-vus that would span from a couple of seconds to several dozens of seconds. I would recall the dreams in the morning but don't know what they meant since they had no context. After some time the deja-vu would happen exactly as I dreamed them

Once I got to 15 yo, so I decided: fuck this, I don't want to play a script and I started to not to do what happened in my dreams. After that moment I started having deja-vu of things that didn't happen. An alternate reality in which, I assume, things went as they were supposed to. I was in a place where I was supposed to be, but different things were happening, I was with different people

Then things got even more complicated, and the second that was the new story line. After a while I tried to get away from the second line too, but then a third line of deja-vus opened, letting me see three different story lines for the same things.

These deja-vus are now less frequent and more apart from each other

**TL:DR: Dreams in my family are really weird and changing things from deja-vus lead only to more deja-vus

I was sitting on my couch using my computer, I offer to catch it and let it outside so she doesn't have to deal with it. Conveniently enough, the moth flies within my reach, and I snag it out of mid-air with my right hand. 

As this is happening, I feel it flutter around in my right hand for a few brief moments, and then it stops. I assume at this point that I had either closed my hand too tightly, killing it, or it had just realized that it wasn't going to get out and stopped putting up a fight. 

After shaking my hand slightly and still feeling no movement, it must have slipped out of my grip and I didn't notice. I then casually open my left hand which was rested in my lap, and lo-and-behold, the moth mysteriously flutters out. I instantly freak out and ask my sister if she saw what happened, to which she agreed that I had caught it with my right hand, but it had somehow moved to my left hand.

1341136745.0,vvhtb,I've never truly told this story before. My glitch happened in Walmart...,ObscureSaint,76,11,16,"Years ago

I was a fourteen-year-old young lady, and this was a strange Walmart in a strange place, and thus it took a little longer than we expected to find all of our items. Dad said he wasn't feeling well.

In the checkout line, candy, magazines. I glance at my dad, and he's staring at the ceiling. ""Dad?"" I ask. He doesn't reply. He doesn't blink. His eyes remain fixated on the ceiling above me -- but there's nothing there.

*""Dad??""* I ask again

This is where the break happens. One moment, his head at my knees, my hands cradling the sides of his head. I'm calling out loudly, panicked: ""Dad -- dad! DAD! Dad!"" He doesn't answer and his body straingtens and strains -- every muscle in his body is tight, he's struggling with every ounce of energy he has but is not moving at all.

Everyone around us simply stands and stares.

He's not breathing. I can hear someone screaming ""DAD!"" and realize it's still me.

Within a few moments of my panicked screams

""I don't know, he's on the floor, he must have hit his head, right?

A bystander (my young friend) chimes in: ""No

The firefighters are able to call an ambulance. My dad grunts and a mouthful of blood comes pouring across his lips. I'm convinced he's dying; people on TV always cough up blood as they die.

He reaches the hospital. He lives. Life goes on as normal

--

What I can't figure out, he was lying on the floor and I was six feet away from where'd I'd been standing, cradling his head in my hands. My friend, the witness, says I caught my dad as he fell, but I don't remember an iota of that action. I don't remember contemplating, ""hey

It's like I blinked, and guided him backwards to the floor as he fell, keeping his head from hitting the floor. I was 5'2"" and 95 pounds at the time ... my giant father should have crushed me as he fell. I don't know how I would have managed it.

I've always told myself I just didn't remember because of the stress

And how convenient was it that paramedic-trained firefighters were standing three lines over when this happened? What are the chances of that happening?

TL;DR: As an adolescent, all without straining a single muscle. I blinked, and I was suddenly somewhere else, and things had happened. Somehow, firefighters happened to be in the exact right place at the exact right time. That's my glitch.

I spent the night at my friend's house

We turn in relatively early, I ALWAYS try to sleep with noise and light otherwise my dreams go from weird to /r/nosleep worthy. So, I feel slightly comfortable, being that I'm sleeping in the same room as Marie on a couch and Summer is in the very next room. I have a clear view of the only entrance to the attic(very important to my paranoia) and Marie can clearly see Summer's door. Which is closed. Note this.

Both the girls fall asleep and I get freaked out as usual so I turn on the TV in that room and turn down the volume out of courtesy. I feel better and eventually fall asleep. I continually have to get up every two hours or so to change the channel, sitting up, turning the lamp on and turning the TV back ON. I just walked over and did my thing once again. I just suspected that Marie turned if off, when I sat down her eyes opened and I simply apologized and got back in bed, and turned off the lamp. Soon the sun went up and I felt much better.

Nothing weird happened. Till Marie told me what she saw. She said she woke up from the static and saw that I wasn't on the couch anymore. She was so damn comfy she decided to wait until I came back so rather that get up herself to turn off the TV. She said she waited for like 10 minutes and I didn't return. She dismissed it knowing I'm paranoid and probably crawled into bed with Summer

Never do I remember getting off the couch or walking around her house. Over and over

One thing that bothers me the most is that I remember the feeling of raising up the top part of my body to turn on the lamp. But Marie insists I was standing. I don't like my brain telling me lies. Or Marie's.

When I was young I was notorious for trying my damndest to catch Santa Claus delivering gifts on Christmas. It wasn't that I doubted his existence, I would usually wake up and run out to the tree to see if he had come yet. One year when I was maybe 5 and my sister 7, my parents got us big kid bicycles. The bicycles were kept next door in our neighbor's garage until Christmas eve because while I wanted to meet Santa my sister's Christmas vice was that she was the worst snooper and would look all over the house for hidden presents and the bikes would be too difficult to hide. That year they asked my Grandfather to come over and watch to make sure I didn't wake up while they were bringing in the bikes from next door.

All went according to plan and I managed to stay asleep during the night but when my eyes opened and I saw the sun already up I ran out to the living room and was so excited to see all of the presents under the tree and my new bike. We did the normal Christmas morning ritual

Even though my sister and I were both too old for it we still had a high chair in the kitchen pushed into the corner. On the seat of the high chair was a cassette tape/booklet combo of [Mickey Mouse Disco](http://imgur.com/6Pm29pq). It was unwrapped but still in the plastic. I grabbed it and brought it to my Mom and asked her if it was for me. She looked at it confused and said she guessed so

When I was older, and it wasn't in his personality to let a joke go on for years, even if he had. Nor was it in my Mom's or my Dad's personality to have never fessed up to it if it had been a joke one of them played on the other. So to this day there's still no explanation where that Mickey Mouse Disco cassette tape came from. But I played the hell out that tape as a kid.
