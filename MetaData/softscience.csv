So I'm wondering:

* Why did animals grow so large back then but not anymore?
* Why do large animals seems to die out?
* Why do we not have any fossil record of much larger humanoids?

I can totally believe that bipedal apes/monkeys/humanoids didn't show up until things had started shrinking, dogs, birds, lizards, armadillos and fish, that there would be some giant man-like creature.

I'm going to explain this using electrons, behave likes waves. We did a calculation for fun in one of my physics classes to determine how slow you would have to walk through a doorway so that you diffract. (When light travels through a small hole, it doesn't head straight through, it bends into a diffraction pattern. Google has some cool images of diffraction patterns you can check out) Turns out it would take longer than the universe has been in existence, but it can happen in theory.

Electron orbitals are described using something called a wavefunction. Don't overcomplicate what that means. Let's pretend that an electron follows a simple trigonometric path, it cannot be there. sin(x) has a maximum value at 90 degrees (pi/2) and repeats every 360 degrees (2pi). The electron has the greatest possibility of being at these maximum points, but there is nothing keeping it from being in a lower probability area.

Now assume you want to know EXACTLY where an electron is, the more certain you are of the electrons position. Eventually you will get to a point where you are pretty sure about where that naughty electron is hanging out at that instant in time.

Now we get to part 2 of the problem. What is the momentum of this electron (how fast is it going)? The momentum of a wave is its wavelength (sorta, not really, but this is just a simple explanation) We go all the way back to our original wavefunction of Psi = sin(x). You'll know from your trig classes that the wavelength of sin(x) is 2pi. We now know that this electron has a momentum of 2pi.

The problem is, it is a mathematical fact. Sucks, don't it?",,False,,t5_2rn1t,,http://www.reddit.com/r/softscience/comments/gt4dn/the_heisenberg_uncertainty_principle_for_dummies/

Excuse me in advanced for how disgusting the following article may be to some of our more skittish readers. However

Okay, this action makes sense, doesn't it? After all, delivering a baby requires lots and lots of pushing. Besides the obvious pushing and straining, a baby traveling through the birth canal has the tendency to compress the intestines, which causes whatever fecal matter that's present to fall out. As gross as it sounds, it actually serves a useful purpose.

To make this the least nauseating as possible, it creeps up to the newborn's colon and ""infects"" it, which prevents the baby from having to develop their own bacteria from breast milk and formula over the first few months of life. The bacteria you're exposed to is the bacteria that you're stuck with for the rest of your life.

So, but it also affects how your body digests certain foods . Thus, how your feces smells. In fact, babies that are born via Caesarean-section that aren't exposed to the various forms of bacteria that's transferred from the mother to the baby during childbirth are sometimes at risk for digestive problems throughout their life. 

Plus

(More details about that here: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090629081443.htm)

I think we can count this one as a win for both woman-kind and evolution.

Hi reddit

I need your help for science!

I'm running a live experiment for the Science Festival at the University of Cambridge (UK) this week, all you have to do is tweet (and more importantly, get people to re-tweet) with the tag #csftwitterbrain. 
Re-tweets are important because they will form the links in the network. I will post the results at the end of next week!

Below is an e-mail I received recently (I work at NASA) -- some portions redacted to protect my identity.  

If a university were to require such things
 
---------------------------------------------------------------

**From the local division chief:**

Please find the below guidelines for Document Availability Authorization (DAA) submissions.  Compliance with the DAA forms submission continues to attract high scrutiny at the Center and within the Directorate.  Whereas Earth Science is far from the worst offender, but I don't want anybody to be caught or surprised by the possible implications of non-compliance with these guidelines.


---------------------------------------------------------------


Scientific and Technical Information (STI) requirement for routing a Document Availability Authorization (DAA-NF1676). (Authors should coordinate with their respective office for proper routing and submission of the DAA and STI documents.)

 

·        Obtain approval of STI information prior to its submission.

·        A Popular Summary must be submitted for journal articles 

·        If a non-civil servant is releasing the information on behalf of NASA a DAA is required.

 

Failure to comply with DAA/STI submission procedures will result in the following:

              

·        Travel orders will not be processed.

·        Conference registrations and publication charges will not be submitted/paid.

 

Examples of STI include but are not limited to:

 

·        Journal articles

·        Meetings/conference papers

·        Presentations

·        Book/Book Chapters

 

 

Information that is exempt from the definition of STI:

Information published in policy documents such as NASA directives and NASA Technical, Technical Standards). 

Information published as a result of mishap investigations (NPR 8621.1, and Recordkeeping)

Proposal information marked with confidentiality notices furnished to NASA by contractors or grantees

New Technology Reports (NTR)/Invention Disclosures. [NOTE: While NTRs are not defined as STI

 
 

READ ON FOR MORE SPECIFIC DETAILS AND INFORMATION:

STI is the results (the analysis of facts and data, and related engineering research and development. Examples include preliminary and final meeting/conference papers, presentation slides, journal articles, abstracts, extended abstracts, books and book chapters, Technical Memoranda, Conference Publications)

We have coordinated with the STI office on a corrective action plan for compliance of DAA submissions on externally published NASA STI in response to the recent CASI review of various scientific and technical websites where over 50% of STI posted were not completed through the DAA review process.  **There will be another compliance check in January 2012 by the STI office.**  (Three commercially-produced publication databases are used to create a pool of externally published articles and conference papers where authors were affiliated with NASA. The rationale for this measure is that the NF 1676 process is required for externally published STI. All NASA Civil Servants are required to use this process to publish STI.  This measure assesses the level of awareness and compliance of Civil Servant authors in regards to the STI process with particular emphasis on journal articles and conference papers.)

I needed a stronger chemistry background to understand what I was reading, and my memories of learning chemistry were intertwined with memories of anguish and stress and nearly flunking the two Chem classes I had to take. Timidly, I made a few unfruitful attempts with my old chemistry books


While randomly poking around on the interwebs, while not really so useful for the backyard gardener, sounded like a pretty cool way to dip my toes into a chemist's pool of knowledge. I mean, hey, who doesn't love spaceships, right? The catch was that the book is out of print and crazy expensive (400 for a used copy). The copyrights holder (the estate of the author) has no plans for a reprint, and rarely respond to inquires. This made me very sad. Fortunately, if you are a redditor
