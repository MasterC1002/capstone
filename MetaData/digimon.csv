You know, the moderation team has decided that we should really just give up.

I mean

* Let's face it
* It's pretty annoying to add -mon to the end of every single creature in the Digimon universe. Pokemon got it right: There's no Pikachu-mon.
* And do I really need to say anything about [this](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100118025818/digimon/images/e/e4/Fusionevolution.jpg)?

We're really excited for this change, all Digimon-related content is forbidden, and should go to [the appropriate place](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon).

You can grab it on dsgamemaker.com/dsgmforum/index.php

I'm figure it's not good enough to be considered for the indie gaming subreddit

Edit: Fixed the Imperialdramon sprite and the Wargrowlmon sprite. If you have guilmon as a starter you end up having a Meramon sprite instead of Wargrowlmon sorry. I'll update the download after a few more edits.

Let me know what you guys think should be changed about it too!
Thanks!

Credit: Spriters resource and Gamefreak since I used pokemon sprites and to the happy galgomon website and Zebub Al-Zemechiel for digimon sprites.

**New update out**: There was a problem where digimon didn't digivolve. The updated version should fix the problem.

**Update**: Increased difficulty on bosses. Chronomon is now available

For the past few months, and relive our childhoods together, potentially introducing today's generation to our fandom.

Beginning in November

At the beginning of each week, and then come back to discuss it. In this way, those of us with a busy schedule can watch one thirty-minute episode when we have a bit of free time, and those of us with more liberal schedules will be able to watch them all at once. (Of course, there's nothing stopping you from skipping ahead - just make sure that you're ready to talk about them when the time comes!)

*You can watch whichever localization of Digimon that you're most comfortable with.*

We're really looking forward to seeing what comes from this! Look for a thread on November 4 for Episodes 1 - 6 of Digimon Adventure! Sit down, and get ready to open the Digiport!

The idea goes like this: the ""mon"" suffix attached to each Digimon actually makes a great deal of sense in a digitally-based world. It could be interpreted as a file extension of sorts

Similarly, so his file name would be ""Seadra.mon""--a file name that has been shortened.

Then of course there is digivolution where as data is absorbed and the files grow

This could even be taken one step further in that the regional origin of the data that comprises the Digimon could factor into the Digimon's ""file name""; for instance, so its data may have mostly originated in a Spanish country; Agumon, Japanese; etc.

The implications from here could be taken in any sort of manner; higher level forces at play in the digital world that could understand and manipulate the digital code could lack the .mon suffix and have a more general name or another suffix,False,self,t5_2rxw7,False,,,t3_r7wno

We're going to be working to add more, so please let us know [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/xq67b/rdigimon_needs_an_upgrade_we_need_flairs_of_our/) what type of flair you would like in the future! We won't always be making announcements about new flair that we add, so check back regularly!

Additionally, select the ""flair"" option beside ""nsfw."" (You can also select ""Meta"" for /r/digimon-related posts, and we have ""Update"" for updates from the moderators. I'm not positive how to make that mod-only at the moment, so [please let me know](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=enforte) if you do!)

Finally, I had no idea that it would get this large! I'd really like to thank our friends at /r/pokemon for helping with the annual April Fool's Day switcheroo, [Seismictoss](http://www.reddit.com/user/Seismictoss) and [Takuya813](http://www.reddit.com/user/Takuya813) for helping with moderation, and all of you for producing such great content!

Before I let you all go, where we'll watch from the very beginning, and once a week, hold a discussion on the episodes we watched. We'll need a clever name for it, though, so be thinking of one!

However, the character aren't as good as i remember, and the repetive nature of the show bugs me a bit. However, much like with the original pokemon, i still get nostalgic watching it, heck im even able to watch it dubbed, despite it being one of the worst dubs i've seen. 
I won't deny it has its good moments. i actually think season 2 is slightly better than season 1
HOWEVER, its probably one of the best reboots out there. And its the first time, i've actually wanted to actually purchase it, but i doesn't seem to be available in the uk, which sucks.
So, I just don't thnk it stands out as well, as it did when i was a kid. I still love it, but in a nostalgic way, not for its plot or characters.

This year is Digimon's 15th anniversary. Digimon World Re:Digitize is releasing today in Japan. August 1st

If you own a currently active site or old Digimon site that hasn't been updated in ages, and Digimon is still going. You can link to [DMO](http://www.joymax.com/dmo/) and the [Re:Digitize Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/Digimon.World.Re.Digitize) page as well, to increase their traffic and show that english Digimon fans want more releases.

I'll be posting threads like these anywhere I can in the community, what their site was all about, and what they're doing today in the Digimon fandom. You can give shout outs to old friends and any other messages you'd like to, as well. Any thread posted in will be linked to from every other thread which I can update, creating a network of them.

If you know any former webmasters, Facebook, Google+, or Tumblr, I encourage you to 'check in' there, too, and recommend others to do so also. Members of Digimon communities I can't post in, can organize similar 'check ins' as well.

Here are the biggest communities I'm posting this thread to

I'm sure many of you have heard of DMO and have been itching to try it. A digimon MMO? How awesome does that sound?! Well, has really tainted the game. It's free to play but without using the cash shop you won't get very far. Sure it's great at first but as soon as you want to start being ""good"" at this MMO, you're going to have a very difficult time.

I'll start with some good points first:

- **It's digimon.** Seriously

- **The Community is nice.** If you can find someone that speaks your language

- **It's pretty.** You can see I'm struggling to find any good points here. But yes, and you can edit a lot of the textures too. Some days it's nice just to hop on your digimon (...using a cash shop item) and ride through the digital world. 


-----Okay.. now for the bad------

- **The entire game is a grind fest.** Seriously

- **All the ""quests"" are mind-numbingly boring.** Every single quest is either ""Talk to person A""

- **It is extremely unfair to those who don't use cash.** This is mainly an issue when it comes to hatching new digimon. Allow me to explain; When hatching a digimon there are hatching phases. To add one phase to your egg you need to insert a certain amount of data (a random drop) for the corresponding type. When inserting the data there is a high chance that it will fail, 5 giving you the biggest and strongest (but still has a random chance to hatch small anyway). It is near **impossible** to hatch a 5/5 digimon UNLESS you use cash. Cash eggs have a 100% chance of hatching at either phase 3, 4 or 5. So even when paying cash you might not get what you want. 

- **Everything is a gamble.** This is what I hate the most about this game. Like I said before, when they fail there's a chance to make your digimon's stat go **down**. Still not convinced? Even the drops are a gamble. Digimon drop eggs (sometimes) when defeated which need to be scanned by an NPC (and cost in-game currency to do so) to find out what drop you got. It can be bread, clothes, data or absolutely nothing. This brings me to my next point.

- **The drop rate is level capped.** That's right

- **You need to pay cash to unlock digivolutions.** I'm not kidding, and for mega you need anywhere between 6 and 9. Some digimon even have their burst modes, buuut you can only unlock those by buying a special item in the cash shop for them. This item is the price of about 8 evoluters.

- **There is no PvP.** Need I say more? There is no real reason to level up your digi other than feeling cool and going for level rankings. Oh but make sure you choose which digimon you want to level for rankings wisely

- **There are bots freaking everywhere.** So. Many. Spam. Bots. Constantly shouting and whispering to you their stupid websites and other crap. You can also download botting programs from sites to grind and play for you. Botting is so blatantly obvious and easy to do that you'd think that the mods would ban them right away. Oh wait

- **Barely anyone speaks English well.** Now I don't mean to be racist, answer questions and many other things. The majority of players are Indonesian, so if you can speak Indonesian you won't have much of a problem.  Most people know the word ""Party"" and that's it. When playing the English DMO, I expect the other players to understand English.

- **The EXP rate is horrific.** From level 1 to about 41 the EXP is fine, durable level you'll need to use cash for boosters. 

- **The ""abilities"" do nothing.** Now, no buffs, no AOEs, just damage to one digimon. Boooring.
 
- **Americans have an advantage.** When you buy the cash shop currency, and therefore sold. I've looked at the methods of buying PSilk and I've never heard of any of them. Why is this such an advantage? You'll see in my next point.

- **Player shops are ridiculously overpriced.** The in game currencies are bits,000M  = 1T. With 1T you are considered rich, it's not very easy to get to without selling cash items. To buy a 5/5 egg from a player,  you will be paying from about 40-50T, a figure impossible to get to without cash. In the Korean DMO, you'll never pay more than 12T for anything. In English DMO, 12T will get you a 4/5 digimon with no evolutions unlocked. This supports my other point about the game being unfair to non cashers.

In conclusion it's a fun little MMO at first but once the initial shine wears off you can see all the terrors that lie below. I urge you to try this game and see how far you can get without using cash before falling asleep.

If you have any questions feel free to ask

I'd like to get a community meeting together at some point in the near future so that we can talk about the future of our little corner of reddit. I'd like to get us all together to work on a big project that'll really put us on the map. So

However

But what exactly IS the Digital Hazard? How can a single Digimon display enough destructive power to threaten the Digital World itself by its mere existence?

I have a theory: the Digital Hazard is the real reason for the D-Reaper's destructive rampage.

The D-Reaper was created by the United States government as a defense program to keep the number of digital lifeforms in the Digital World in check

Well, and it was called *The Reaper.*

My theory is that the Digital Hazard is based off of the Creeper, the Digital Hazard was truly malicious in its design: it infected the digital world and made Digimon destructive and violent. If left unchecked, the infected Digimon would reach the world's communications networks and bring about significant damage to them. In response, the United States Department of Defense created the D-Reaper to destroy infected Digimon and keep the remaining population in check so that they wouldn't be able to threaten the world's networks again.

But as it turns out, the Digital Hazard corrupted his data, causing his incredible power to surge out of control and disrupt the fabric of the Digital World.

Sensing the very same virus that it was created to destroy

Here's the idea I have so far:

Veemon: Plasdramon

Title: The Fusion Dragon

Description: An 8-foot-tall humanoid dragon digimon with blue scales and large wings, greaves, and forearm guards. The right half of his armor is red, and the left half is black. His right shoulder guard resembles Flamedramon's helmet and curved horn, while his left resemble's Raidramon's helmet and lightning-shaped horn.

Attacks: 

* Fusion Flame: Fires a large sphere of orange flames at the opponent.

* Fusion Blitz: Covers his body in light blue electricity and rams the opponent.


Hawkmon: Swallowmon

Title: The Sky Samurai

Description: A 6-foot-tall humanoid bird with red feathers and talon-like feet, and the top half of his face and beak is covered with a silver winged helmet, similar to Halsemon's. In his right hand he carries a katana sword.

Attacks:

* Zephyr Slash: Slashes with his sword

* Swallow Cut: An impossibly fast attack that slashes the opponent with its sword twice in quick succession.


Armadillomon: Petromon

Title: The Ocean Driller

Description: A 6-foot-tall bipedal humanoid wearing white full-body armor with gold highlights, legs, and back, and he carries in his right hand a spear with an elongated drill at the end.

Attacks:

* Drill Torpedo: Launches the drill at the end of the spear at the opponent.

* Black Gold: Launches a glob of crude oil from his spear to slow down the opponent.",self,t5_2rxw7,1366923269.0,,3red,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/1d3cqy/i_just_had_an_awesome_idea_the_regarding/
