I'm not much of a fan of sex scenes in TV shows/movies - as often they seem crammed in there.  Fortunately, and then they moved on with the plot.  It was a breath of fresh air as often shows that include such things break the pace with their sex scenes.

Spoilers for UK HOC and US HOC S1 and possible S2 spoilers below.

Something that irked me a bit about the way Underwood dealt with Russo was how hands off it was - it was a lot more passive and opportunistic rather than planned as was Urquhart's murder of O'Neill

I'm hoping that Francis deals with Zoe in a much more hands-on way to make up for that. In UK HOC

Underwood relieves the stress of his machiavellian ways by gaming and also by using his rowing machine... One of the first times he meets with Zoe, which IMO more than makes up for the passive killing of Russo as I'm fairly sure that Zoe will put up a fight and Underwood will have to actively be killing her.

That's how I think Underwood will kill Zoe.

I'm not entirely sure how closely US HOC will follow UK HOC, against the King who causes a constitutional crisis when he all but declares his support for the Labour Party (as opposed to Urquhart's Conservative Party) and essentially campaigns for them which he is not supposed to do.

I'm from the UK, with Walker ultimately resigning the office and causing Underwood to come to power without having to be elected. This is how Urquhart comes to power in UK HOC and as we're currently a way off an election in the US HOC timeline I can't see any other way Underwood would come to be the President, which I am certain he will.",,False,self,t5_2t3ft,,http://www.reddit.com/r/HouseOfCards/comments/1iu72e/season_2_predictions_spoilers/

He establishes a plan early in the series to ""devour the whale one piece at a time."" By the end of the season

It seems that Frank's plan all along is to leverage the importance of the PA special election to maneuver his way to where he is at the end of episode 13. This means he needed Matthews to step down from VP to govern PA. To achieve this

He flies off the handle at Claire for her betrayal on the Water Shed bill, after the DRWA is defeated, Frank quickly sets up Russo at the gala with Rachel the prostitute. He doesn't seem to maneuver at all to prolong Russo's campaign viability and simply decides to proceed with the sabotage phase. Why was he so angry at Claire for pushing up the timetable if he so quickly destroyed Russo anyway? Am I interpreting the plot incorrectly? Did he even need the DRWA to pass, or did he just need it to make Russo seem viable up until the vote? If that's the case, why did he even care that the bill was defeated?",,False,t5_2t3ft,True
1360770724.0,18g6ul,Confusion about Frank's scheme [Spoilers up to Ep. 13],diamond,21,4,19,"OK

But there's one thing that's bothering me.

Throughout the season, destroying anyone who got in his way, and generally being a brilliant son of a bitch. In the last few episodes, we saw his plan finally come to a head and it was revealed that his ultimate end goal was a VP nomination. And Zoe seems to have finally realized that as well. But a couple of steps along the way seem to contradict that conclusion.

Let's work backwards through this. Frank has been offered the VP slot because Matthews is stepping down to run for his old Gubernatorial seat. Matthews had to step down because of Russo's flameout and death. Russo imploded because Frank drove him back into the bottle, of course, that happened because Claire turned against Frank, and we all remember how Frank reacted to that.

And that's the problem. If Frank was aiming for the VP nomination, Matthews would stay where he was, and there would be no need to nominate a new VP.

I suppose it's possible that Frank had a different plan to destroy Russo before the election, and there was certainly no reason for him to be angry at Claire for undermining it. If anything, she gave him the perfect opportunity to accomplish his goal.

The only thing I can figure is that Frank originally had a different plan, I'd love to know what his original plan was; maybe we'll learn more about that in S2.",,False,self,t5_2t3ft,False,,

The only issue for me is, in order for Frank to be considered for VP, the current VP would have to be out of the picture, and the only way that could be done is by sending him back to Pennsylvania to resume his role as governor. For that to happen, Frank needed a candidate from Pennsylvania to fall out of the race.

Also I understand Peter was a huge liability and was possibly going to out Frank the next morning so maybe Frank really had no choice but to do what he did to Peter, the police commish. Also Christina should have been a little more suspicious at Doug than the show showed. Peter calls her late in the night in distress, so she calls Doug and then the next thing she hears is that Peter is dead. She doesnt even know for sure that Peter wasnt there when Doug arrived. Also how was Frank certain there was no security cams in Peters complex that could easily show there were two people driving in the car?

Before that: Claire is placed in some situation where she can either save Gillian and her baby or not (maybe a private showdown where Gillian falls and is at a risk of miscarrying) and chooses not to help wherein Gillian and the baby die as a result -- thereby making her as bad or worse than Franks actions with Russo.

Also: Stamper becomes attached to, he is the one to tell Meetchum that the brick was a hoax.  He either dies or runs off with Rachel... maybe Frank demands his time and he wasn't there to help Rachel in some crisis and as a result Rachel gets hurt or dies and -- as he comes to understand that they are both essentially damaged individuals selling their services in different forms -- his chance at salvation is lost, he falls off the wagon, and betrays Frank (i.e. becomes a good guy at last as Frank is a straight up fucking murderer no matter how complex, interesting, and endearing).

If the second (final) season was shot prior to the Red Wedding

As for Lucas and Zoe

The only one coming out ahead in the whole thing will be Janine, and single-mindedness will keep her safe... unless it doesn't.

Oh yeah, she miscarries and Frank isn't there thereby killing her abiding devotion to him once and for all.
