I love this subreddit. I've found some of the best deals through it, to help people find good deals on fashion. That being said, there's been a pretty noticeable uptick in ""OMG look what I found at a thrift store!"" posts recently and that does nobody on this subreddit any good. I'm happy that folks have found good stuff and thrifting is definitely a frugal option, but this subreddit isn't about flaunting what you bought at a frugal price. Instead it's about sharing deals with the community.

So I guess this is a request to the mods and the community as a whole: lets stop the karmawhoring and actually share deals with members of the community. I'm glad people got a deal thrifting (I've got a pair of Allen Edmonds that testify to the perks of thrifting)

1356054502.0,1579zs,A Basic Guide To Target (Xpost MFA),Contrapaul,502,83,47,"**I was asked by several people to cross-post my guide to shopping at Target to this subreddit in addition to MFA

Where I live there are quite literally Targets everywhere, and I like their clothes.

Because of the amount of time I've spent in Target, I have some knowledge about what is good, what is bad, and how to win at Target. I'm going to outline what you can and should purchase, what to avoid, and most importantly, when to purchase certain things.

**Brands at Target**
 
While there are plenty of different clothing brands in Target, Merona, and Converse One Star.
 
**Mossimo Supply Co.** is Target's [younger](http://i.imgur.com/dMFvQ.jpg), though while [shirts](http://i.imgur.com/6eE9O.jpg) and hoodies are plentiful, the brand has less outerwear than either other brand, which is too bad. Mossimo is great for picking up some basic items, and the value for the money is great on lots of them- but not all.
 
Fit is [""athletic""](http://i.imgur.com/ZZM9v.jpg) on lots of things, or just wrong- like their [twill 5-pocket pants](http://i.imgur.com/k5rYo.jpg) that boast a ""relaxed fit"" in areas. These pants are not relaxed. Jackets are also a little weird, with similar items sometimes fitting very differently. Their filled windbreaker fits me fine as a small, but a similar looking [hooded windbreaker](http://i.imgur.com/GJnKV.jpg) is unattractively large at the same size.
 
As mentioned, and the quality is very [good](http://i.imgur.com/5higo.jpg) for ~$10. Mine never seem to shrink or stretch, and I've been complimented lots of times on these tees. [Layering items](http://i.imgur.com/yGEtu.jpg), like [henleys](http://i.imgur.com/vXrdy.jpg), [baseball shirts](http://i.imgur.com/Xf1dF.jpg), and [hoodies](http://i.imgur.com/kldHR.jpg) are similar in quality and fit, and come in a wide array of colors. [Mossimo pants](http://i.imgur.com/KEYvX.jpg), are decent quality for the price, stripes

Other items of note: [Cords that are $20-$25

[Full Album of Mossimo Picks](http://imgur.com/a/xCXTG)
 
**Merona** is Target's more formal brand, but not across the board. Merona has plenty of items in ['classic' colors](http://i.imgur.com/rWxGi.jpg), like [navy](http://i.imgur.com/NpLZU.jpg), [tan](http://i.imgur.com/Vvakm.jpg), [grey](http://i.imgur.com/kHiFu.jpg), and [black](http://i.imgur.com/vFJCz.jpg), and of late has added [brighter](http://i.imgur.com/aZnZM.jpg) [colors](http://i.imgur.com/kmWSZ.jpg) to a number of items. They provide an entry-level selection for plenty of [business-casual](http://i.imgur.com/3lZJm.jpg) [items](http://i.imgur.com/1YSM4.jpg)
 
A bunch of Merona items feature a ""tailored fit"", and were baggy everywhere else. A [medium sweater](http://i.imgur.com/NLrIX.jpg) may fit too large, and be next to a [medium cardigan](http://i.imgur.com/ekoKe.jpg) that fits perfectly, next to a [medium jacket](http://i.imgur.com/tb0sy.jpg) which fits like a small. Generally *a* size will probably work, but occasionally you'll wish that XS and MS existed in men's at Target.
 
Merona [""Ultimate Dress Shirts""](http://i.imgur.com/O97sP.jpg) get touted on Dappered often, and made from decent fabric- but fit can vary color to color, and even piece to piece. There are also [Merona](http://i.imgur.com/Kdha9.jpg) [accessories](http://i.imgur.com/vCc5a.jpg) which are not bad for the price, don't buy the ties though- they're overpriced and unimpressive.

Other items of note: [Twill shirt that is thick enough to be a light jacket](http://i.imgur.com/tzBT4.jpg), [$4 beanies that feel like *at least* $8 beanies](http://i.imgur.com/AmRnd.jpg).

[Full Album of Merona Picks](http://imgur.com/a/5xi5C) 

**Converse One Star** is Target's smaller, and more [grungy](http://i.imgur.com/leotA.jpg) than Mossimo, and while the styles are more [unique](http://i.imgur.com/EgWiY.jpg), the [colors](http://i.imgur.com/jl68J.jpg) are [muted](http://i.imgur.com/DH5CK.jpg). [Olive](http://i.imgur.com/HcMLx.jpg), [grey](http://i.imgur.com/Cu15H.jpg), [black](http://i.imgur.com/29wTR.jpg), [cream](http://i.imgur.com/acmsN.jpg), which can be a bit disappointing
 
Fit in general tends to be a bit big, fitting less close than my medium Uniqlo mountain parka. It's also pretty long, which looks good on my 6'2"" frame, but I imagine a 5'9"" guy weighing 150lbs would be dwarfed in the thing.
 
The cloth on their [shirts](http://i.imgur.com/TDTTB.jpg) is soft and [comfortable](http://i.imgur.com/qcsyw.jpg), such as this [weekend bag](http://i.imgur.com/qCIsx.jpg), that aren't bad- though I'd remove branding.

Do you guys remember the thread(s) about Woodies sunglasses a while back? I just want to tell you about my experience with them

I ordered a pair of the light grain sunglasses on January 29, it all worked out. They ultimately got to me about two or three weeks later. Whatever, that's not a big deal, and it's not why I'm writing this. It was very obvious early on that they were fragile. They were light and somewhat flimsy. That's not why I'm writing this either.

After I got them, I could wind up in the hospital, if that shows you how good of care I took of these sunglasses. But alas, they still found a way to break. 

I emailed the company for the first time about the possibility of returning them on February 27. I did not receive a response. I emailed again, no response. 

In the 43 days since I sent my initial email, I just checked..I see your orders but no other emails."" They wound up giving me another email address to write to. I have sent a total of 8 emails to the company through all of this, and had two twitter conversations with them during which I gave them my email address. I have received auto-responses saying they would get back to me, so I know they have received some of the emails, but I have still not gotten any reply whatsoever from an actual person via email, and they have avoided the issue on twitter, repeatedly deflecting it back to email.

I want to say that I understand that others of you have probably had more positive experiences with them, but don't expect any help if they break.

Again, and that is obviously my fault. But it is no excuse for how they conduct business.

They ignore their customers in private, that they do not actually try to fix things. Don't waste your money with these people. Their product is crappy, and so is their customer service.

Also, I do have proof of the emails I have sent.

1371664036.0,1go2jt,FMF Sale Guide: Banana Republic,Nicholie,316,47,67,"*A quick sale guide to explain the madness that is Banana Republic. If you're new to FMF


Banana Republic’s popularity stems largely from their ability to hit a wide demographic, at a somewhat reasonable price. But, like so many other retailers now, they play the “always on sale” game. This guide should help clear up some confusion about when you're really getting a good deal at BR.

***Golden rule: Never pay MSRP.*** Banana Republic has a ridiculously inflated “full price”, Suiting, specific types of shoes, some chinos, collections, etc. You’ll have to simply read the fine print of the sale to know when and what isn't included. Please note that the online often has MORE exclusions than in-store, so say you want those bright red Emerson chinos, what is actually a good sale at Banana Republic? ***Normally no less than 40% off full-retail should be considered.*** Of course


* ***The 40% Off One Full Priced Item (One day only; Online &amp; In-Store)***

   Ran weekly during some months and usually on Wednesdays, the bare minimum one should expect from Banana Republic. It brings most shirting down to around $40-30 (a good deal if the slim or tailored-slim fits are good off-the-rack for you), and chinos in the same range. Also not bad to use on some basic essential items like socks, boxers, belts, etc.


* ***The Cookie-Driven Online Only % Off (Online only)***

   By far BR’s most annoying sale-type, simply based on random draw. As stupid as that sounds, it’s luckily a fairly easy thing to work around by either a) Delete your BananaRepublic.com cookies and revisiting the site until you get the maximum value or b) Altering the cookie-string with a browser add-on. As a Chrome user I use Edit This Cookie. [Here's a guide to do this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1h70tz/bananarepubliccoms_cookiedriven_sale_modification/)


* ***The Friends &amp; Family Sale (Online &amp; In-Store)***

   Held twice a year, is a great bargain on the exclusion items not found in other sales. It may take a little begging to generous BR employees online or schmoozing up your local stores to get access.


* ***The % Off Sale Items (Online &amp; In-Store)***

   Another sale where you have to be willing to show some patience and play your local stores, you can find some good deals in the clearance section of your local stores. Items that have hung around too long can be severely discounted already, and this code will stack. I've nabbed $15 dress shirts and $20 wool pants from these. Do note that some will be tagged as “Final Sale” and can’t be returned. Online merchandise is never marked as Final Sale to my knowledge.


* ***A word about the Banana Republic Card***

   Normally, it did when I opened mine). After that, you earn 5 points for every $1 you spend at BR/Gap/Old Navy. At 1000 points, you earn $10 in rewards, or working out to $10 every $200 you spend. However, very often they'll run double and triple points day, quickly reducing how much you need to spend to earn the credit. After you spend $800 with the card, which has free shipping on all online orders and some exclusive sales (not very notable however). As always

* Whenever you buy something, promo code doesn't work for your region, item(s), or whatever) try emailing and calling customer service. They often times will apply promo codes for you that the website will not allow. I've saved a ton this way. While I do not condone fraud (I see recommendations for committing fraud all the time on here), I think as long as you are honest in what you are trying to do, and the customer service rep does it for you that is fine. I never lie to get additional promos added.

* always check for student or corporate discounts.

* I've even gotten free shipping just by calling customer service and asking if I could have free shipping.

* if an item is available for less after you already purchased it

* before you buy anything check ebay for coupons. you can often times call customer service and they will apply these coupons even if you dont physically have them. if they dont

* check out the different gift card websites. gift cards are an awesome way to save because they always stack with other sales/promos. I have only used [cardpool](http://www.cardpool.com/)

* fill out surveys, follow on instagram and twitter, and call/email companies to get all the promos you can. whenever you have a bad experience with a website or customer service, let them know. I've gotten tons of $5-15 gift cards from sites just because I let them know I was let down by   their site/service. Again, I am always honest.

* ebay is awesome! work on refining your searches to match exactly what you want and then save the search and have the results emailed to you daily. I've gotten killer deals on things when people have buy it now prices too low.

* another ebay tip is to always ask questions when in doubt. I've found sweaters listed as larges that when I asked them to measure they turned out to be the sizes of mediums (things shrink, trust measurements.

* another ebay tip is to check out their [Fashion Outlet](http://www.ebay.com/fashion/outlet/) that is how I found out about the killer [Hart Schaffner Marx](http://stores.ebay.com/Hart-Schaffner-Marx-Store) sales. It is still going on and they just added more! they probably will continue adding items until MSM goes out of business. I've bought over $500 from MSM's ebay fashion outlet and I couldn't be happier about every item I've received.

* another ebay tip is to not get emotional when bidding. if you get outbid be absolutely sure you want to increase your bid. I virtually never increase mine. I wait until another

* just because something is a good deal doesn't mean you should buy it. Only buy what you would wear (or what you are sure that you can  resell for more). If you already have some CDBs, but dont make the same mistake I did and end up with 10 pairs of shoes you've never worn just because they were cheap. What a waste of money! I really wish I would have thought about if I would actually wear them before I bought them all. I also dont ever buy from old navy, asos, or aldo anymore. I have never gotten anything from those stores that I wear. Sure, it's cheap, but it's also shit. Why would you want to wear cheap looking clothes that look terrible? I wouldnt even wear most of their stuff if it was given to me for free.

* thrift as much as possible. if you dont know your style yet, since you can buy things that you know you will wear.

* Only buy things that you will wear. If something is the wrong color, shape, or if you already have a better alternative that you will always wear instead of it, or if it doesn't match your style or doesn't fit in your wardrobe, dont buy it! I have a pair of blue suede shoes that I've never worn. they were a great deal, but the color and style of the shoe is something I would never wear. I regret that purchase a lot.

* Buy things that work with your existing wardrobe. dont buy things that you hope to one day include in to an outfit. in my experience, items you need for it, you will be able to buy things that you are sure will get plenty of use. I see a lot of people in waywt posts that dont have any particular style. It must be a nightmare to know what items to buy and their items cant be very versatile in their wardrobe. This is really important. If you are stretching yourself too thin across too many styles it's going to be costly to complete the different looks. It's better to focus on one look and nail that, then to try to mimic everyone else's looks.

* learn to sew. or at least tailor everything. if something doesn't fit you probably wont wear it

* when buying work boots wait until factory seconds are available. I've gotten most of my boots from factory second sales. Why would I care if there is a nick in the boot? After the first week of wearing them there will be plenty of nicks. buying new boots is like spending an extra $100+ so that they look nice for that first week. doesnt make sense to me.

* check out all of the [flash sale websites](http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/12i2v2/the_flash_sales_and_affordable_shops_megapost/) and keep checking the sale sections of your favorite sites. Being early to sales is really key to getting the hot items before they sell out. check out bargain sites like [sierra trading post](http://www.sierratradingpost.com/)

* know what you want. think out the looks you want to complete and have a list of items you need. keep that list in mind while checking out sales. If you dont know what you want

* levis are a great starting point for jeans. until you are ready to spend real cash on denim

* shop the clearance racks. items who's season just ended often hit the clearance racks. if possible

* buy wigwam over smartwool. I've gotten wigwam boot socks 3 pairs for $2 at walmart's clearance isle in the middle of summer. outside of that

* all you really need to look good is jeans, and a jacket. you could have a killer wardrobe for $1000. if this is a style that interests you...

* if a company messes up, you need to be persistant with these bastards. Some companies are really bad with trying to enforce a policy in situations where it doesn't make sense. If they've messed up, you shouldn't have to pay anything. even the policy stated return shipping or restock fee.

1355510856.0,14us7h,Tip for patient people shopping shoes or apparel or anything - Regularly check Amazon Warehouse Deals,Robbie_Tussen_jr,291,52,19,"Some of you that already troll the Amazon warehouse deals are probably cursing me right now

[Link](http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=1267877011)

So you hit that main warehouse deals page and search for whatever.  Sometime's there's nothing if you have a specific brand in mind (Currently Chippewa comes up empty).  The way it works is these are typically returns so they could be an open box or even worn for weeks before returned.  But you're still purchasing from Amazon so you have the same return policy as buying new.  At worst you're out the time invested in returning them if there's a problem.

For instance

Red Wing 8196 boots
Clark's Desert Boots in beeswax
Thorogood black moc toe boots with white wedge sole

The patience part comes into play once you realize that the longer an item is available the cheaper it gets.  Slowly (as in days between drops) the price is lowered in small amounts until its purchased.  If you find something that's not already at an incredible discount

Happy hunting.

**MyHabit**

http://www.myhabit.com/

One of the easiest places to start this is with MyHabit. This is a separate website from Amazon, Gilt, Haute Look, and Beyond the Rack. While it is often filled with junk not worth your money, good sales can come up. If you absolutely want to spend an Amazon Gift Card on *clothing* this would be your best bet.


**Pants**

Amazon has some of the commonly suggested ""MFA Beginner"" pant options available.

* [Levi 511](http://www.amazon.com/Levis-Mens-Tumbled-Night-30x30/dp/B004PLNFES/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357500838&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=levi+511)

**Shoes/Boots**

In my opinion

* [Allen Edmonds](http://www.amazon.com/Allen-Edmonds/e/2373666011) - Allen Edmonds is an MFA favorite for dress shoes. While currently full price, down to $200 shipped free with prime.

* [Red Wing](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=brand_abn_6?ie=UTF8&amp;bbn=679255011&amp;rh=n%3A672123011%2Cp_4%3ARed%20Wing%20Shoes%2Cn%3A679255011%2Cn%3A679307011&amp;rnid=679255011) - One of

* [Clarks Desert Boots](http://www.amazon.com/Clarks-Originals-Mens-Desert-Boot/dp/B0007MCUTK) - One of the most recommended and most mocked shoe in the history of MFA, and generally is lowest price around for them.

* [Thorogood Moc Toe](http://www.amazon.com/Thorogood-814-4200-Moc-Toe-Boot/dp/B002QQ8XRI/ref=pd_sbs_shoe_1) - Though less commonly recommended than Red Wings or Clarks, with similar (although lesser) quality.

**Watches**

Watches are another item that Amazon is known to do particularly well in. However

* [Timex Weekender](http://www.amazon.com/Timex-T2N651KW-Weekender-Olive-Through/dp/B004VR9HP2/ref=sr_1_4?s=watches&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336676816&amp;sr=1-4) and [Timex Easy Reader](http://www.amazon.com/Timex-T2H281-Reader-Leather-Silver-Tone/dp/B000AYYIYU/ref=sr_1_1?s=watches&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336704944&amp;sr=1-1) - These are the two ""MFA Beginners"" watches that are frequently recommended. They're cheap

* [Seiko 5](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?rh=n%3A377110011&amp;keywords=seiko+5+automatic) - Frequently seen suggested to beginners as an intro or first watch with a mechanical movement.

**Personal Care**

While not technically ""fashion""

* Shaving Supplies - If you're into straight edge or double edge shaving, or [search for ""amazon""](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/search?q=amazon&amp;restrict_sr=on) and you'll find some good information.

* Skin Care - Skin care is also of course super important. Read [Veroz's guide to skincare](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/t0yzd/a_guide_to_taking_care_of_your_face/) and check out the [sensitive/oily](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/ton7l/alternative_skincare_guide_sensitiveoily_skin/) guide as well. Both of these guides have tons of Amazon links to products that will keep your face looking as good as your clothes.

[Here's the original post on r/malefasionadvice](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/vuhd4/simple_guide_to_tailoringslimmingtaking_in_your/)

Taking in a shirt really isn't too hard to do, it does take a little practice to get perfect. Here's the basics along with some important points:

***Keep in mind that if the shoulders of your shirt are too big (i.e.

For demonstration, [we are going to replace the entire seam along the side of the shirt](http://imgur.com/Qx2J4). The existing seam is called a 'flat felled seam'. It's fairly complicated to make, and trying to 'tie into it' would never look quite right, so I'm just going to replace the whole seam with a simple straight stitch. 

First put on the shirt

For a nice slim shirt

Based on my measurements and these calculations, 19.25"", 19.0"", 20"", and 21"" starting at the button at armpit level and working down. 

Completely button your shirt, it's too lumpy). Using your tape, and starting at the armpit, mark the new width of your shirt. I basically move the tape up the shirt until the [width at the armpit seam equals the width you want](http://imgur.com/atgdP). Note that altering the shirt in the manner I describe will raise the armpits. Mark this spot on both sides of the shirt. I use tailor's chalk, or in this case a fabric marking pen, which you can pick up at Walmart for a few bucks. Once again, measure twice (notice I messed up the first time

Continue to mark the width of the shirt at each [button below the armpit](http://imgur.com/eO5kB). Keep in mind that you can always take away more fabric, the width of your shirt probably shouldn't change by more than 1"" per button, so if you have a very 'hourglass' figure, you might not want to slim the shirt too much in the thinnest areas.

Ultimately, 19.5"", 19.5"", 20"", and 21"" at the last button (which is where the shirt ends at the hip).

Now

You'll also have to slim the sleeves somewhat. Again, but I'm going to use an 8"" width. 

Place the tape measure perpendicular to the top of the sleeve and such that it crosses the bottom of the sleeve about 2 inches from the armpit. [Now measure down from the top of the sleeve to your new width and mark the sleeve at this point.](http://imgur.com/K3RRk)

Connect these markings with those at the armpit and [the seam at the end of the sleeve](http://imgur.com/nVTrp). At the end of the sleeve, but absolutely no one is going to notice.

[Here's my shirt all marked up.](http://imgur.com/GeALJ)

Time to start sewing. I [start at the armpit to make sure the armpit seams from both sides of the shirt meet perfectly](http://imgur.com/as6NB). Basically

Do this on both sides of the shirt.

Now [try your shirt on](http://imgur.com/wqca1). At this point, you can undo the stitching with a seam ripper. I could probably take another half inch out of each side, but I want to wear it as it is for a day before I take it in any more. Plus, I'll be wearing an undershirt with this shirt (since it's a little see-through), which will take up some more space.

If you're happy with the new seam, you have two options: 1. you can either sew a zigzag stitch or some other stitch that prevents fraying in the fabric to be removed (i.e., between the new seam and the old seam) as close as possible to the strait stitch or I just use [pinking shears to cut away the extra fabric](http://imgur.com/X9aXr). Pinking shears cut fabric in a zig-zag pattern to minimize fraying. I will admit that pinking shears are not an ideal way to prevent fraying, but they work well enough for me, and I'm lazy.

That should be it. [Here's my newly slimmed shirt.](http://imgur.com/wboLt)",self,t5_2s8e9,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/vuyb7/simple_guide_to_tailoringslimmingtaking_in_your/

* ***How does this work?***

   BR's website generates a random code and places it into the cookie your web browser stores. This cookie certifies a code that gives you a certain percentage off (BRSPARK40/35/ETC for todays example). [Here's a demonstration of the site giving me to different values in two different browsers.](http://i.imgur.com/T0JPqpV.png) So how do you change this to the maximum discount? Two methods: deleting your cookies and having the site re-generate for you


   ***Note: This is written as


   Edit this Cookie is a simple Chrome web  browser extension that will let us alter the values in the cookie placed by BananaRepublic.com. We start by navigating to the BR site


   The value we are going to change is on the very end of the ""mktUniversalPersist | .gap.com"" cookie. It is the letter at the end of ""VolControlSEG"" ([screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/duLm7Op.png)). This controls what % off is allotted to you.

My advice on the topic of referrals or rep codes and how to incorporate them so that individuals can actually use them and not break reddiquette

&gt;Your best option would be to link to the standard url

Also in that comment I explain why we remove referrals

&gt;We have strict removal when it comes to referrals because the use of referrals promotes self gain over frugal advice and can cloud a users judgement on whether or not the sale actually benefits the community. I understand you were just trying to help and it is very much appreciated

This is especially true for Amazon. You can find a great deal somewhere but if an OK deal on amazon (which pretty much has everything) will gain you referral credits

This advice is not terribly fashion oriented as that is personal so if you match orange pants to a green jacket


Much of this advice can be applied to thrift or consignment stores as well, so I am limited to eBay.  The CliffNotes of ""thrifting"" is that you can quickly look through a rack of jackets and shoes, but shirts and pants may take time as they are usually sorted by color so you have to sift through hundreds of shirts and pants.  Try it in your area though as you can literally buy a sport coat for $3.


**Know your size**.  This is highly critical as a tailor can fix things slightly off for cheap


Pants extra help:  With pants you should pay attention to length carefully and generally rely on OUTSEAM which is the length from the top of the pants to the bottom of the cuff.  Reason for this is that pants come in different ""rise length"" AKA the distance from the crotch to the top of the pants.  If you rely on the inseam

Suit length extra help:  This is where the S, 5'6"" and under is Short, 5'7"" to 5'11"" is Regular, and 6' and above is Long.  Once you have or find a good length suit jacket, measure the length from the top of the collar to the bottom of the jacket and same from bottom of collar to the bottom of the jacket.  The reason for this is the S, R, and L sizes are not standard and Zegna's L is the same size as Lavin's R....by knowing the measurement for you


Sleeve length extra help:  Make sure you know your jacket sleeve length and the extra material inside the sleeves when buying used.  If the jacket listed is too short, the sleeve length should be really close as alterations can make the buttons look goofy.


**Know how to search on eBay**.  This involves knowing brands first off.  There is no reason to buy a Johnny Carson jacket off of eBay for $50 unless you are having a 70's party.  Buy quality.  Below are my searches you can copy/paste into eBay and save.



44 (Andreas, Baldessarini, Barba, Barbera, Battistoni, Belvest, Bijan, Borrelli, Cantarelli, Cheshire

44 (Dunhill, Fleece, Freeman, Gianluca, Greenfield, Isaia, Kiton, Luciano, Partenopea, Smith

New list as of 5/3/2013 to suck up Savile Row clothing specifically:

44 (Barrie, Hitchcock, Littman, Norton, Gieves, Kilgour, Amies, Strickland, Sheppard, Comelie

Notice how 44 is by itself?  Notice how there is no S/R/L even though I'm a 44L?  Many eBay people are lazy and will not include jacket length in a listing.  The reason for the 44 by itself is that lazy eBayers will not put down 44 as the size in the product listing


Run both these searches (split into two as there is a search length limit on eBay) in BOTH sport coats and suits sections.  Don't get hung up on suits as generally most business types have way more sport coat/pants combos than full suits and a jacket/pants combo can look as good or better than a full suit.  

Once you know that you like or hate certain brands, for example, most dudes consider Ralph Lauren to be a good brand name.  But….in suiting, MOST Ralph Lauren suiting means crap except for the expensive and hard to find black and purple labels.  Stay away from Tommy Hilfiger and Polo and learn to know Brioni, Kiton, and Chester Barrie.


**Style help**:

http://www.primermagazine.com/2012/spend/primers-visual-guide-to-understanding-common-suit-features

http://www.rsvlts.com/2012/08/29/a-gentlemans-guide-to-a-well-tailored-suit-infographic/


**Sport coat help**:  When you have a suit, etc.  These days, you can wear just about any jacket with just about any pants, so don't get wrapped around the axle about the terms.  The only think I personally subscribe to is to not mix a pinstripe jacket with trousers as it kinda stands out that you are wearing a ""suit jacket"".  Go to material for all jackets is 100% wool.


**Dress Pants help**:  Pants are a little harder to find on eBay to be honest.  Also expect to pay higher prices proportionaty than jackets.  For example I routinely get $XXXX jackets on ebay for $30 to $70.  Huge savings.  Dress pants which retail in the low three digits will routinely go for $50 to $100.  This is what I've seen


**Get a tailor**.  Find a good tailor in your area that deals with menswear.  Remember this always:  a properly fitted suit from Kmart is 100% better than an ill fitting Savile Row suit.  A good tailor can lengthen/shorten jacket sleeves, lengthen/shorten pants, take in or let out the waist of pants, cuff or decuff pants, or even turn MC Hammer pants into slim pants.  Know that tailoring any full suit can run close to $100 depending, so the better you are with measuring and selecting, along with dumb luck, just go to Macy’s and buy a sack suit like the rest of the sheep.

* ***Understanding the three types of Amazon purchases: 1st Party

   *1. 1st Party Sales* are of items shipped and sold by Amazon.com directly. You can easily tell this by simply looking under ""In Stock"" where it will state so. Amazon doesn't always default to their own items

   *2. 3rd Party Fulfilled by Amazon Sales* are of items sold by a 3rd party (so someone other than Amazon) but shipped through Amazon. It will state ""Sold by X and Fulfilled by Amazon."" Often this is just as seamless as 1st Party sales other than the management of returns/exchanges which will be handled by the 3rd party responsible.   

   *3. 3rd Party Sales* are of items strictly sold by a third party through Amazon

* ***Does Amazon have Sales? And [CamelCamelCamel](http://camelcamelcamel.com/)***  

   Something Amazon does extremely well is micro-management of item pricing. The price for any given product can drastically change over time. In this sense, along with some other retailers. This is EXTREMELY valuable if you're interested in buying an item when it's at its cheapest. You can set it to notify you via email or twitter when your given item is the price you desire. One thing worth noting is that since CamelCamelCamel must pull this data from Amazon, it's not always completely up to date. The benefits of passively monitoring an item for drastic changes in its price however is worth this small drawback.   

* ***20% Off with Email Subscription***  

   Amazon does offer a flat discount code of 20% off (with some exclusions; read the fine print) by signing up for there two email lists: [Shoes](http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=5637565011) &amp; [Clothing](http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=2678052011).

Here is my attempt at this. I'm posting it as its own post rather than a comment because it's large
   
Some disclaimers first... I only searched a handful of the usual suspect low-price stores (H&amp;M, I didn't search kohl's or any department store, or any of the flash sales (I did check Jack Threads and they didn't seem to have any of the right items at the moment). Also, I can't speak for the quality or fit of anything listed here. But then again, to me frugal style is about buying as low as possible, tailoring, and repairing. Ok here we go
   
**KNIT SILK TIE**  
It's hard to beat $25
+ Tie Bar squeaks in there at [$15](http://www.thetiebar.com/tie-bar-product.asp?pn=22528&amp;orderPageReturn=%2FcategoryPages%2FAll%5FTies%2Easp&amp;pg=4&amp;categoryIds=31, but I have no experience with them.  
   
**CORDUROY PANTS**  
Lands End usually is among the frugal choices. In this case
+ Assos has a handful on sale (only certain sizes available) for [$24](http://us.asos.com/ASOS/ASOS-Slim-Cord-Chino/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=1876609&amp;SearchQuery=corduroy&amp;Rf-700=1001&amp;sh=0&amp;pge=0&amp;pgesize=20&amp;sort=3&amp;clr=Tobacco), and [$38](http://us.asos.com/ASOS-Skinny-Fit-Jeans-In-Cord/x4e2y/?iid=1765682&amp;SearchQuery=corduroy&amp;Rf-700=1001&amp;sh=0&amp;pge=0&amp;pgesize=20&amp;sort=3&amp;clr=Tobacco&amp;mporgp=L0FTT1MvQVNPUy1Ta2lubnktRml0LUplYW5zLUluLUNvcmQvUHJvZC8.). Keep in mind that many of these have slash pockets (like a chino) rather than jean-style pockets.  
+ H&amp;M clock in right at [$30](http://www.hm.com/us/product/98833?article=98833-E)  
+ 21 Men is the most expensive at [$33](http://www.forever21.com/Product/Product.aspx?BR=21men&amp;Category=m_bottom&amp;ProductID=2017873205&amp;VariantID=)  
   
__CHUNKY SWEATER__  
Sweaters are often quite expensive
+ H&amp;M lists an interesting shawl collar cardigan with toggle closures for [$35](http://www.hm.com/us/product/01648?article=01648-B#article=01648-A). I saw this one in the store and I quite liked it--very puffy and soft. Will it fall apart if you look at it wrong? Maybe...  
+ H&amp;M also have a boat neck pullover with some textured knitting for [$35](http://www.hm.com/us/product/02958?article=02958-B#article=02958-A). I get the sense that boat necks might be risky choice, and it seems fittingly chunky.  
+ Again from H&amp;M
   
**TWEED JACKET**  
For me, they had an unrivaled selection of sub-$150 tweed blazers. There were a couple more that popped up on their search that I didn't include here because they were just too weird (who wants a tuxedo-style shawl lapel on a tweed blazer?)  
+ Brown
+ Light grey
+ Navy
+ Dark grey
   
__SUEDE SHOES__  
The $150 Meermins that Metacarfre picked already seem like they might already be one of the best deals going, though. Namely, the suede Bass shoes that people loved as white Bucks in the Summer are also offered in Fall-friendly colors.  
+ The Brockton for [$69](http://www.shoes.com/en-US/Product/EC1278886-5116142/Bass/Dark+Brown+Suede/Men's+Brockton.aspx). For some reason
+ The Stockton for $85
+ The Barret, certain sizes available on Shoebacca for [$46](http://www.shoebacca.com/bass/barret-barret-201.html?utm_source=froogle&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=froogle)

1356313943.0,15cowe,A Guide To Buying (Mainly Used) Men’s Clothes on eBay ,camelcaravan,203,46,19,"I figured I’ve taken advantage of some great deals, but I ended up making almost 1500 just casually selling

For starters, I know some people may be turned off by buying used clothes, but honestly over time you won’t even notice. 

You can go to your local thrift shop for awesome deals, missing buttons, a stain that you couldn’t see) that detract from the quality of the item. I have picked up some very nice pieces of clothing at my thrift stores (Barbour, Brooks Brothers, J Crew, Vineyard Vines, Ralph Lauren, but I’ve also picked up nice clothing that has been destroyed and disgusting (I have horror stories...). This is why I like to buy off eBay. You’re covered by buyer protection so if the item does have defaults with it

Research, wait for the auctions to close. Figure out what the average selling price is, and base your limit off that. 

Check the tags. Tags are often a tell-tale sign of the age of an item. If there is no picture online of the tags

Pictures matter, not enough light, or some other way that makes the item seem not as good. If the description seems to check out with no faults, go for it. If you really want to see some pictures, ask the seller nicely to send you some. 

Know what type of person you’re buying from. There are two different sellers on eBay: those who sell their own clothes or their family’s, and don’t expect to make much of their clothes. Also, it can be easier to be pick up multiple items from the same seller because they usually list more than one article of their own clothing, which can help you save on shipping. 

Develop a connection between someone selling their own clothes. If you buy from someone who is selling their own clothes that are your size and you have a good transaction with them on eBay, and also by Paypal with a 2.9% + $.35 transaction fee. Tell the seller that you would be willing to deal directly on Paypal for transactions, which will save them a ton in the long run. I now have several people who I stay in contact with about their clothes, and I am able to get prices better than those on eBay because 1) they have gained my trust and know I will pay, 2) they don’t have to deal with the hassle of listing an item, 3) because I’m helping them save money by taking away those damn eBay fees. 

Newly listed is your friend. This is the search item I do 90% of the time. Some of the best deals can be buy it nows by people who do not know they can get more for their item than what they listed it for (e.g. I bought a $20 Brooks Brothers Shirt

Negotiate, as you’ll have to negotiate a selling price early if the price is much lower than what the item will sell for. Negotiating for a buy it now will be much easier. I’ve negotiated with people selling their own clothes and those looking to make a profit selling other people’s clothes, but negotiating with people that sell their own clothes is much easier. They tend to not want to deal with the auction length and hassle, so if you reach out to them with a price that’s attractive, they might bite. That being said, never go over your limit that you sent with POINT 3. As a side note, although you CAN get suspended for it, but I’ve heard that you can get suspended for doing this. 
 
Ask about combined shipping rates. Combined shipping can really help you save on multiple items. When I’m selling shirts, so they get the same price due to the flat rate of the packaging. 
 
Be wary of loaded lots. Buying clothes in lots can save you a ton, not by the average price of each item (e.g. set a limit of $15 for a J Crew shirt and $5 for a Converse one in the same lot).
 
For the best deals, which will be time consuming, but people sometimes miscategorize their items or do not put the proper title or enough description to tell what their item is (e.g. I once won a J Crew lot that did not have any sizes listed in the description. I won a lot of 24 items for $78. I later sold 22 of those items for $400. Cha-Ching...)

I hope this helps! I was able to expand my wardrobe immensely for college with these tips

**Searching**

You really need to know your exact shoe size. It's important, even Payless, and use their foot-measuring tool to find your exact size.

Redditor /u/Julianos94 provided a fantastic link with all the higher quality brands. [Click Here](http://www.ebay.com/sch/Mens-Shoes-/93427/i.html?LH_PrefLoc=2&amp;_nkw=%28%22edward+green%22%2C+peal%2C+%22brooks+brothers%22%2C+alden%2C+lingwood%2C+lobb%2C+vass%2C+testoni%2C+edmonds%2C+mcafee%2C+church%2C+hermes%2C+crispin%2C+zegna%2C+santoni%2C+faconnable%2C+ferragamo%2C+sutor%2C+mantellassi%2C+%22shell+cordovan%22%2C+%22purple+label%22%2C+trickers%2C+grenson%2C+crockett%2C+gravati%2C+kiton%2C+tramezza%2C+sargent%2C+weston%2C+lattanzi%2C+heschung%2C+balint%2C+scafora%2C+valextra%2C+branchini%2C+bontoni%2C+bemer%2C+aubercy%2C+corthay%2C+Dinkelacker%2C+%22paul+stuart%22%2C+asprey%2C+tods%2C+etro%2C+sander%2C+carmina%2C+albaladejo%2C+%22paul+smith%22%2C+martegani%2C+altan%2C+artioli%2C+barrett%2C+bestetti%2C+stefanobi%2C+borgioli%2C+cheaney%2C+cleverly%2C+ducker%2C+donegan%2C+gaziano%2C+guyot%2C+klemann%2C+loake%2C+maftei%2C+melkersson%2C+moreschi%2C+materna%2C+meier%2C+myhre%2C+pape%2C+peron%2C+petrocchi%2C+reiter%2C+scheer%2C+schneider%2C+stanislas%2C+suzuki%2C+crisci%2C+ugolini%252). However, and my shoe size:

 ""Allen Edmonds 12 D""

 ""Penny Loafer 12 D""

 ""Alden Chukka 12 D""

Once the search is returned

There are a couple things to look for when inspecting a pair of shoes. Of course, inspect the pictures a little further.

**Inspection**

There are a few standard shots that seem to be provided

- [Top Down](http://i.ebayimg.com/t/Allen-Edmonds-Montgomery-12-D-/00/s/MTAyNFg3Njg=/z/JhUAAOxyhlJRfUqu/$T2eC16V, pay attention to how deep the creases are. Dark, deep creases usually means that the upper has a lot of wear. [What a good used upper looks like](http://i.imgur.com/vbVOgcf.jpg)
- [Side Shot](http://i.ebayimg.com/t/Allen-Edmonds-Players-Shoe-Wingtip-Oxford-Black-Leather-12-D-335-/00/s/NDAwWDcwMg==/z/55wAAOxyoA1RXQXv/$T2eC16h, discolorations, water spots, etc.
- [Rear Shot] Here's where you really see just how much wear the shoe has gotten. The heel wears out on the outside half
- [Soles](http://i.imgur.com/mCJ0cdc.jpg) This is where you really get to see the age of the shoe. If it has the original leather sole (or even a recrafted sole), the divot, and the heel detail. [Example of a very worn sole and heel](http://i41.tinypic.com/3495pg9.jpg). Notice the different shades of color on the footbed and the lack of detail on the heel. [This is an example of a nice sole](http://i40.tinypic.com/90byi9.jpg). 
- [Closeup of Damage](http://i.imgur.com/3CCAXqW.jpg) or [This one. Ouch!](http://i39.tinypic.com/2dov8p.jpg)

If the seller does not provide you with all of the pictures that you want

**Bidding**

You might ask, ""well, how much do you have budgeted for one pair of shoes?"" You need to have an idea about exactly how much you're willing to spend on a pair of shoes. Obviously, the more you spend, the better condition they will usually be in. I usually keep my ceiling at $140. 

There are three ways to win an auction: highest bidder

- *Buy it Now*. The easiest way to purchase a shoe. If it's an option that's available, go ahead and buy it. Got a pair of AE Breton Penny Loafers for $50 that way.
- *Best offer*. Often, offer $60, $75 and $80. You could just get a nice steal.
- *Win The Auction*. The best way to do this is to use a sniper. [GIXEN](http://www.gixen.com) is a website that will make last second bids on your behalf to your auction. This is how people win auctions. It's not some guy sitting at his computer hitting refresh. With Gixen, put that number in the input box and then list your absolute highest bid. Effective sniping involves knowing about what price the shoe should sell for, and offering bids ending in $_2 or $_7. Why 2 and 7? Because there might be 10 other people watching this auction, and most of them are going to bid in round numbers, like $100, $115, $120. So, why 2 and 7? Because there's a second group of people that *know* about this round number bid and will bid $1 more

So

I was fairly skeptical. Even if they were making quality OCBDs for $25

So I checked these out on Sunday, I would say) and the fit is impressive. I am not as svelte as some on here, but the medium fits a 6' 190lb man well, and I would say it was snugger than a J Crew slim (but not quite H&amp;M slim). The length is not too long to be worn untucked, and I was especially impressed by the sleeves, which is where so many slim fits screw up (either the size or arm whole placement). There is even a little contrast stitching in the bottom button slot as well as on both forearm buttons.

The are a few cons I can think of. First, which is too low in my opinion. You can see this on the picture of the model. He has the top two buttons undone, but it seems they were careful about keeping the collar together. While the shirt is thick, it's not thick enough for a hairy man such as myself to wear without an undershirt. Kind of a bummer, but not a deal breaker at this price. Lastly, there were a lot of loose threads that needed snipping.

Overall though, I picked up one in white and am wearing it at my desk.

Lastly, but they weren't boot cut at least. If I were starting a frugal wardrobe, this would be one of my first stops.",,False,self,t5_2s8e9,,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/10e247/25_jcp_slim_fit_oxford_cotton_button_down_review/

I'll be honest: I've become pretty discouraged with MFA lately. I got up the balls to post on my not-so-throwaway account what I thought was a fantastic outfit, calling me pretty much everything in the book.

I'm starting to get the feeling that they look down on everything that doesn't fit a very rigid hivemind mindset as for the plebians, because people need more encouragement than that, and I'm one of 'em. But they're pretty fucking quick to circlejerk over street fashion, which I just don't get.../sigh

My complaints with MFA have led me to say thanks to FMF for *not* being tremendous dicks

1342978906.0,wz1nq,Tailoring your pants,super56k,146,24,32,"There's a handy sidebar guide on tailoring your own shirts.  I have followed that with great success

Now, I also have baggy pants similarly neglected.  They fit well enough in the waist and inseam, but were way too big everywhere else.   

The great thing is that it's actually easier to alter your pants (assuming waist and inseam fit) compared to a dress shirt. Rather than me explain the simple process, adjust if necessary.

He's happy to leave the excess fabric so that it's reversible

**A hopefully obvious note here: If your pants rise/seat fit how you like

If you do cut away the excess you want to leave around 1/4"" and [sew a zig-zag stitch to prevent fraying.](http://i.imgur.com/jMupJ.jpg)  This is a very basic stitch that about any cheap sewing machine can do.  [Here's a video that explains the process.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egdZHT17H7Q)  

There's really not much more to it.  In my case I've converted baggy pants I paid anywhere from $3-8 for into great fitting Alpha Khaki clones.  And, even on cheap clothes you'll find that they're constructed well enough, with durable enough materials.  It's the proportions that aren't right, and that's easy to change. 

A few notes to end on: 

As of last week I had not operated a sewing machine since taking a home economics class in high school over ten years ago.  There's probably a lot of you with doubts about being able to do this (my doubts kept me off getting a machine for most of this summer)

For simple alterations it's really all about prep work.  Mark clean lines, and that's it. If it's not right, you can always rip the new seam out and get it right.  It's always reversible until you've cut away the excess fabric. 

And lastly

* ***Finding out the current inventory.***

   Allen Edmonds sells its factory second quality shoes, great! All you must do is simply walk in, find/ask for what you're looking for and they'll see if they have it in stock in your size. If they don't they're able to do a look up of the inventory across ALL the outlet stores, along with the central warehouse; dubbed the Shoe Bank. If one of these options has your shoe, they can have it shipped to you relatively cheaply. 


   But what if you're not close to a Allen Edmonds Outlet? You're not left out of the loop. You can email any of the stores with there storename ahead of @allenedmonds.com. A popular one is the Freeport store address: freeport@allendmonds.com. Alternatively

* ***Sale Types - Standard Sale &amp; 2 for $$$***

   The outlet/shoe bank sales follow a similar path to regular store sales, etc.) and specific events (Soles4Souls, Tent Sale, etc.) Prices in these sales will fluxuate shoe to shoe without any real consistency of what goes on sale and what doesn't. But what I find to be the best deal are the 2 for $$$ sales. This is where out of a select set of shoes, you get two pairs for a flat price. Some recent values for this include 2 for $250, 2 for $300, and extremely rare (May of 2012 was the last I recall) 2 for $200. Being able to knock out two pairs of fantastic shoes for a Benjamin each is hard to beat. These type of sales seem to occur every few months. Oftentimes these are not announced beyond word of mouth.

Remember, eBay often has brand new items for cheap, and you can see the market value by searching completed listings.


**WHERE TO BUY**

*Allen Edmonds Shoebank* - Widely considered by many to be one of the best values around.  The shoebank offers ""factory seconds"" which are AE shoes that did not pass the factory's quality control due to a cosmetic defect.  Note that this defect does not affect the construction of the shoe and is often unnoticeable or repairable.  The shoebank runs sales every few months which discount seconds to $150 or under (including the 2 for $300 sales).  When these sales occur
shoebank@allenedmonds.com for a list of what's available.  *Notable footwear: [Strand](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/product_6478359_1_40000000001_-1); [Park Ave](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/producti_SF270_1_40000000001_-1)*


*Amazon and Amazon Warehouse* - Amazon occasionally runs sales on popular shoes or boots making them very affordable.  [Amazon Warehouse](http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=sv__img?ie=UTF8&amp;node=1267877011) carries products that were returned to Amazon and can no longer be sold as ""new in box"" but may have only been tried on or had the box opened.  *Notable footwear: many Allen Edmonds; [CDBs can get to $60](http://www.amazon.com/Clarks-Originals-Mens-Desert-Beeswax/dp/B000WU8SBG/); [Chippewa Apache can get to $80](http://www.amazon.com/Chippewa-20065-Handcrafted-Lace-Up-Chocolate/dp/B0036VN8N6/)*


*Revolve* - [Revolve](http://www.revolveclothing.com/) offers designer clothes at average prices.  However, Beckman and IR](http://www.revolveclothing.com/brandpages/RedWingShoesM.jsp?&amp;d=h); [Wolverine 1000 mile boot](http://www.revolveclothing.com/DisplayProduct.jsp?product=WOLV-MZ3&amp;c=Wolverine&amp;d=h)*


*6pm* - [6pm](http://www.6pm.com/) is essentially an outlet for Zappos and tends to offer very good prices on less popular models.  Additionally


*JCP* - Has begun to aim for a younger and more fashion-conscious demographic.  They've technically done away with sales, they also make a boot version that is unavailable at the moment; [Cutter boot](http://www.jcpenney.com/dotcom/stafford-cutter-mens-boots/prod.jump?ppId=pp5001521714); [Suede wingtip](http://www.jcpenney.com/dotcom/shoes/mens-shoes/dress-shoes/claiborne-gaylord-suede-oxford-dress-shoes/prod.jump?ppId=pp5002301337)*


*DSW* - Frequently offer significant sales and they carry many popular brands.  *Notable footwear: their house brand is Mercanti which is a good deal when at or under $100


**SHOE CARE**

Quality shoe trees can be purchased on the cheap at [Jos A Bank](http://www.josbank.com/menswear/shop/Product_11001_10050_101593) during their many Buy 1 get 2 or 3 free sales


[Allen Edmonds](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/cati2_Shoe+Care+Products_1_40000000001_-1_1_image_0_N_216_216__subcategory) is a great option for brushes, and more, since they ship everything for free.


Good luck finding some quality shoes at the lowest possible price.  Fellow FMFers


*Note 1 - deals on footwear and shoe care items can often be had at outlets such as Nordstrom Rack, etc.  However, these outlets are total crapshoots.  You never know what you'll get or how good the deal will be.

I had been jonesing for a pair of stands for 6 months or so before I saw a deal on here for new Strands from Amazon for $195. Sweet! I finally got Strands. BUT when they came, a couple days later, I changed my mind, called them up and asked if i could exchange them and give them the 20% back. The guy said I could exchange them, but he wasn't going to worry about taking the 20% back(merry christmas, right?). So I get the new shoes in a couple days, but I wasn't happy with the fit (too narrow). I figured since they're new, the sales associate happily offers to exchange them, when he was about to check me out, I got $495 worth of AE swag for $156

1355952480.0,154oki,"20jeans.com: Fit, Quality, and Experience",jries,148,44, hey it's $20

**Fit:** I am 6' tall and ~145-150lbs,"" and even under the slim section of the site. The fit is quite a bit more on the ""skinny jean"" side of things for my taste, but hey, they'll suffice.

**Quality:** Well, at least for jeans, and the fabric isn't you're standard denim. They feel kind of papery, if that makes sense (think of like a paper towel) and the pockets are VERY thin, and feel like they'll rip should I put a pen or keys in them. They also seem to stretch a bit when I bend my knees, but the site does say they are 3% spandex.

**Experience:** Okay, especially during the holidays. The Website was very easy to use and there was no hassle ordering like some of the higher end sites seem to experience from time to time (ex: ""Okay, where do I put the coupon code? Why is there 5 screens just to buy something? etc.) Overall I'd say the jeans are worth the $20 I paid for them, granted I wasn't expecting much for $20 and I got what I paid for, and they're getting new items in all the time, so I may shop with them again.

So a recent thread asking about good thrift stores in Dallas got me thinking: Why don't we make a list of thrift stores in each city, hours, etc. I think this would be a great tool for all of us to use. It could be very well that there is a great thrift store in your own city that you don't even know about. 

Of course this would require a lot of collaboration and input. I can make some reviews of thrift stores in Portland and Eugene, etc.) as well. I imagine this taking a few months before we have a good enough amount of content, but i think it will be worth it in the end.

I heard about 20jeans.com on this subreddit

**PRICE**
This is why we're at /r/frugalmalefashion, which had a 5$ surcharge for the size. That is, if you want it in a size (any size) it's $25. Still very reasonable, but it's a little funny having the actual price come out on the sizing page. I am not bothered by this.

~~Shipping was a flat $15

**SHIPPING** Like I said, early Thursday morning, and my package showed up on Saturday. Awesome. If only the package I ordered from Newegg had shown up at the same time, I'd be busy playing games and not making this post.

**FIT** This is where we come to an interesting point. See, 300 lbs, bit of a belly but not outrageous) and as such I tried to order the largest items for what I was getting. I got an XXL Navy Plaid Pearl Snap shirt, an XL Armin hooded sweater jacket, and a pair of Natural High raw denim jeans, 42 x 33.

The hoodie fit better than I expected! When I lose a bit of weight, the hood actually fits normally on my oversized cranium. Bonus.

The jeans fit PERFECTLY. Not the skinniest cut

The shirt? HILARIOUSLY SMALL. I even doublechecked that it was XXL. I could only snap a couple of the snaps, and WAY smaller than the hoodie. This will probably look good when I lose a LOT of weight, though the arms will likely be awfully restrictive. Then again, I'm a bulky dude. YMMV.

**OVERALL CONCLUSIONS**
Am I happy with my purchase? Pretty much. Though I wish I could at least pretend to fit in that shirt, so it's not a total wash.)

What was the best part about ordering? The original tags left on the items. Seeing what they would cost at a store is fantastic.

What was the worst part? The shirt size

Would I recommend 20jeans to others? Absolutely. I'd mention that the sizing can be a bit scattershot

Why? Your clothes get most of their wear in the washer and dryer, doing laundry costs money (electricity, detergent, dryer sheets, etc.) that you could otherwise be saving.

How? You should always wear a tee (one that covers your armpits!) under a button up shirt. This allows your button up to go through 2-3 wearings before it needs to be washed. It is the analogue of wearing underwear under your pants; it allows them to be worn multiple times without being washed. Essentially

Bonus: Use the “delicates” setting if none of your clothes are very dirty (just casual use). This puts less strain on your clothing with no change in cleanliness.

note: I can’t stand feeling that I’m wearing dirty clothes

2) Don’t put your clothes in the dryer.

Why? It puts unnecessary wear on your clothes. In fact

How? Hang dry your clothing. You can get a wheeled clothing hanger for $10-$15 at your local grocery/all-purpose store.

1351909626.0,12jpqq,"Guide: Getting the outdoorsy streetwear look of Norse Projects, Penfield, etc. for cheap",ad-absurdum,119,20

I love the look of these brands ([example](http://hypebeast.com/2011/02/norse-projects-2011-fallwinter-collection-lookbook/), here's what I've sort of figured out:

**Outerwear:** 

*Technical Parkas:*  This is gonna be pretty costly no matter what you do.  Uniqlo has a [""mountain parka""](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/made-for-all/men-mountain-parka/072931-67-004), or [Norse Projects](http://www.norseprojects.com/store/aw_2012/outerwear).

*Down Vests/Jackets*: Uniqlo has a whole down section.  [Gap](http://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=61883&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=239729002) has some good looking down vests this year as well.  [J Crew Factory has a few](http://factory.jcrew.com/mens-clothing/jackets_outerwear/cotton_nylon_outerwear/PRDOVR~90461/90461.jsp).  Then there are the slightly more expensive

*Other:* I sort of hesitate to include this because it leans a lot more outdoors than streetwear


**Sweaters:** Patterned sweaters are pretty important to this look. Fair Isle is pretty commonplace this year, [H&amp;M](http://www.hm.com/us/product/05287?article=05287-A), [Uniqlo](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/store/made-for-all/men-fair-isle-crew-neck-sweaterlong-sleeve/073367-32) etc.

For plain colored sweaters

**Shirts:**  Shirts for this look are mostly button downs.  Fabrics like [Chambray](http://canvas.landsend.com/pp/mens-chambray-shirt~246599_-1.html), and Denim all have their place.  However, you need to be careful not to look too ""work wear"" ish, as there is a distiction between the two looks.  This look can easily be combined with streetwear elements, so different patterned shirts (microfloral, camo) can be used as well.

Basic (horizontally) striped long sleeve tee shirts work too

**Pants:** Norse Projects doesn't seem to use jeans.  This is one of the major distinctions between the outdoorsy streetwear aesthetic and more the traditional outdoors workwear look.  Instead, and Dockers Alpha Cargos (which don't seem to be stocked anywhere currently).  For other pants, go for chinos in dark navy blue, dark brown, dark grey, or just plain old light khaki.  Of course, colors like dark green and dark red are not off limits

**Footwear**: This look can use all kinds of footwear.

Penfield loves Danner hiking boots

Another part of this look is a basic, [jack purcells](http://www.zappos.com/converse-jack-purcell-cp-white-white?ef_id=azhPX7z2SAMAAIT9:20121103020247:s), or generic surplus would work well.  Sockless of course.

Other non-hiking boots are also acceptable, and they can be part of everything from wingtips to desert boots.  You can have a cobbler resole an existing boot, but i'm not sure how well that will work or how cheap that would be.

**Accessories:** I honestly don't know enough to do this category.  A lot of places have fair isle patterned scarves, somebody else may have to write up their own mini-guide.

I recently became addicted to Flash Sale sites, do me a favor and let us know as much technical info as possible- like, do you recommend sizing up/down, shipping times, thread quality, you know, your general experience with that vendor.

I'm only going to post a couple of one-a-day sites as I'm not really a fan of them. It's super rare that I like what I see and then I'll just wind up forgetting the site even exists.

### Clothing!

[JackThreads](http://www.jackthreads.com)- I love the stuff on here. I've only ordered once but it came in about 6 days and everything was in new condition. Very happy with everything except I think the color was a bit nicer on the website for some things. I get a lot of expensive looking Chambray button ups here. This made me a flash-site guy! My favorites are the Nucos and 191 stuff. Items can be held in cart for 15 minutes.

[Frank &amp; Oak](http://www.frankandoak.com)- Discovered this tonight and haven't had a chance to try it out yet. They design and manufacturer all of the items sold. $6 shipping

[Plndr](http://www.plndr.com/)- Pretty big mix of stuff

[No More Rack](http://nomorerack.com)- Flash sales start at 12pm EST. Shipping is $2. 8 Sale Items a day. YMMV here, jewelry, electronics. I've never ordered here. Items can be held in cart for 15 minutes.

[Rue La La](http://www.ruelala.com/) – Flash sales last for 1-3 days and open and close constantly. Rue la la has sales on designer clothing and accessories. Shipping starts at $9.95. They have a huge selection of designers- but not a lot of items. Looks like a great place to get Kenneth Cole

[Ideeli](http://www.ideeli.com/)- Flash sales start at 12pm EST. Flash sales last for 40 hours or until the sale items are sold out. Most items ship for $9.95. Ideeli sells clothing

[Beyond the Rack](https://www.beyondtherack.com)- Flash sales start at 11 AM EST and last for 48 hours. Shipping is $9.95. Beyond the Rack sells designer clothing and accessories. Crazy deals on Clarks and Outerwear right now!

[Chrono Shark](http://www.chronoshark.com/)- Part of the http://www.sharkstores.com group of one a day sales. LOTS of Invicita and Victoronix. It's pretty rare that I see something I like, Citizen, Victoronix) tend to have models that are of a very different quality from one another. For instance, one Invicta might feel like it's worth the $200 you paid for it and another model of Invicta might feel like a dollar tree watch. Look at reviews elsewhere before diving in.

1365627111.0,1c36s2,Clothing staples that should be recommended more often.,StochasticFantastic,115,23,82,"Hey guys

I've recently found that reddit tends to have its stand-by's in terms of its staples. We get it: Mossimo V-neck's from target, Docker's Alpha Chinos, CDB's etc.

I feel like we should have a thread devoted to clothing staples that aren't necessarily on sale

Onto my contribution to this thread:

I absolutely love American Apparel Tri-blend Track T-shirts. They're made from a mixture of cotton, J-Crew (Broken-in), and the usual suspects (hanes,gildan) etc. but none of them provided in my opinion any comparison in terms of comfort/looks/durability.

My favorite point about these shirts is they never wrinkle, and they still wear and feel as if they're basically brand-new. For around $10 a pop on ebay (better to buy in bulk), I don't think there's any better value.",,False,self,t5_2s8e9,,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1c36s2/clothing_staples_that_should_be_recommended_more/

* I think many people's reservations against thrifting is the fact that the found clothing may be dirty or tattered.  In my experiences 90% of the clothing I find is in almost perfect condition.  Think of it as buying a used car; if you can get over the fact that someone wore it before you, and a massive saving.

* Missing a button?  Be a man

* The advantage of thrift stores is that the clothing is cheap.  The disadvantage is that most stores do not sort by size, which is almost as good.

* At $5/dress shirt and $7/designer jeans, or salmon shorts.  As long as it fits well and isn't stained or damaged, it's interesting and useful.

* Thrift stores tend to have an abundance of button ups, khakis and work trousers, and standard jeans.  They tend to be weaker at skinny jeans, skinny ties, cardigans, stylish vests, GTH pants

* Know generally what you're hunting for when you go.  Set targets: Pink polo

* The method of fitting your forearm

* Thrifting is all about efficiency.  Going through every article in every rack is going to be demotivating and a waste of time.  Often times you can get a much better yield ratio if you're actively checking tags for size and brand; personally

* Contribute to the store!  If you're planning to make a trip to buy

* All it takes is one trip home with a pristine $5 Express 1MX fitted button down that retails for $60 in store for you to realize what you've been missing out on.  I don't find thrifting embarrassing at all

* I should mention that I live in Boston.  Big cities will obviously have better selection.

This is all I have.  If anyone else has any tips

Edit: commenter's tips:

* Steal from your dad's wardrobe!  Also gives you a chance to make fun of his stupid hawaiian shirts.

* Ask your store when they restock

1364219534.0,1az0s8,[DISCUSSION] Moving requests to self posts only,TheCommodore12,116,24,40,"I think many of us find the informal request system a little bit flawed.  Requests typically consist of a title with something along the lines of ""where can I find a cheaper version of this?"" and a link.  These posts do little to generate discussion and often are just filled with FMFers asking for clarification to help find a suitable replacement.  Many times

[Recent Example 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1arphv/any_cheap_lookalikes_to_these_cranes/)

[Recent Example 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1auyjf/where_to_find_this_jacket_any_cheaper/)

[Recent Example 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1aw5o3/similar_sweatshorts_for_less/)


I'd like to see us go to a self post only system for requests and here's why:

1.  It would eliminate links with no clarification.  The poster would be required to fill in some kind of text and may

2.  Building off #1, style, color, etc), where he's located, if he has a tight timeline, etc.

3.  It makes the poster actually think about what he wants.  Too often someone posts a picture of a good looking guy in less-than-stellar clothing and wants to mimic the look.  The standard FMF/MFA response is to ""be as good looking as that guy.""  If the poster has to think about cut, and style, maybe he'll realize there isn't anything he particularly likes aside from that specific person's looks.  Furthermore, OP will be more invested in his post and be more likely to truly be interested in what he's requesting.  I always get annoyed when I see a request, spend 5-10 minutes tracking down the last place I saw something similar, and then OP doesn't seem to care anymore.

4.  This isn't a main concern, but there's no reason to ""give karma"" to someone just for making a request.


[This poster made it pretty clear what he's looking for](http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1avnxy/request_a_frugal_alternative_to_these_striped/) and

I also like [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1aqgyx/retro_short_boardshorts/) as the poster articulates specific features he wants.  We would never know he was looking for those features if he had just posted a picture.

I purchased 10 silk ties from the new guy for $42 shipped through paypal.  Shipping was pretty quick for China and only took about 10 business days though this can vary....shipping to me from China seems to be hit or miss in terms of speed.



Ties are great quality though can arrive a little rumpled from shipping.  They are silk and are normal heavy weight ties



If you want to get a great deal on quality ties
Visit http://stores.ebay.com/goodmakers/_i.html?_nkw=-Bow+Tie&amp;submit=Search&amp;_sid=1002155559 and find the ties you like.  Write down the item numbers (each listing starts with the item number).  I went the additional step and emailed him a picture of each tie that I Photoshopped up (my order as an example:  http://i602.photobucket.com/albums/tt108/Unabomber007/Untitled-2_zps59317b04.jpg ).  Send him your paypal address and he will invoice you.



If you are scared to do this off of eBay like me



Contact him through ebay or through cbbhbb_mq2825rfo@members.ebay.com.hk directly.  I gave him my paypal address and he sent me an invoice.  I paid and he shipped the same day.

**Update 10/2/2012**: After reading comments and taking advises from others, I along with another friend who is also a redditor here, are accumulating a list of  potential retailers from the USA, mostly smaller retailers and some large chains. When the list is adequate, I will send out a survey gauging the interest of these companies to provide their products for a group buying website as a promotion like groupon for a cheaper price, or even provide their fashionable seasonal inventory that they need to sell for a much cheaper price. It's decided that if 10% of these companies are interested, I'll go ahead and further invest in this startup.

I got a lot of Visa gift cards for Christmas. They make great gifts for people that are difficult to shop for, I was left with 4 cards with about $6 each. Amazon, however, will only let you pay with *one* card, and $6 clearly will not buy you much.

1361331916.0,18v58x,Make the Most of Your Money: A Guide to Selling Your Used Clothes on eBay,camelcaravan,95,13,21,"A couple months ago, but I know some guy posted an awesome guide on how to buy suiting on eBay so I am sure you can use those techniques in reverse for your own auctions. Also

Do Your Research: Search eBay for your article of clothing that you are trying to sell. Search by your size if possible. eBay has a feature where you can look at auctions that ended with a bidder, etc. Another important feature is distinguishing between colors, types of shirts, etc. Some colors sell better in others of the same exact shirt. 


Strategic Pricing: There are several different methods of selling your item. 

The “high roller” is setting your auction at .99 and letting the market determine the value of the item. I don’t quite have the guts to do this as often now as I have lost money a couple times this way. The only time I would use this model is if your item is HOT and attracts large bidding amounts in the auctions that you’ve seen. For example, a full $40 higher than the last sold shirt (High scarcity combined with a massive demand for these fueled this price as well).

The auction type I list at most is the “I’m happy with this, list it at that price. I also usually add in a Buy It Now option with this type of auction. This presses people beyond the market demand price, and lures them to pay a little more to snatch if before the auction ends. 

The last type of auction is the “long timer”. I really don’t have time for this one, except the seller was selling them for about $75 (market demand ~15-30), which is probably more than full retail for them. I offered to go lower, but the seller told me someone would eventually buy them at that price. It took a couple months, but the item sold (for $65). This type of auction could last for a while, possibly never even selling. 

Old Clothes are Old: When selling your used clothes, so deal with it. Sell your clothes within 3 years of buying new (varies if you bought the item used) if you want to maximize your profits. 

Make clothing lots of the same size/style: Having multiple of the same size item in one auction can actually save you money with shipping fees that you would have to pay for each individual item. Also

Seasons: Selling your clothes at the right time can make you a much more substantial amount than other parts of the year. Do what Marshall’s and TJ Maxx do: list your clothes at the beginning of the age appropriate season. Honestly

Title: This is what gets people to see your item. Include as much description as you can. Take this title for example: J Crew Tailored Fit Madras Lightweight Shirt Medium. Make sure you list the brand, and the size. You CAN add other things (colors that are in the item for instance), but the ones I gave to you are the essentials to obtain the most traffic. DON’T get a subtitle. This is for chumps, whom eBay loves to take advantage of. 


Photos: This is simple: take good photos. eBay now gives you 12 photos for free to add to your gallery. Make sure you have good lighting and good angles when taking the picture. Another important thing to make sure of is that the coloration of the picture matches as closely to the actual color of the item. Take pictures of any spots or damages to the shirt.

Categorizing: For God’s sake

Description: Don’t overcomplicate the description. Don’t tell us how you just wore it your girlfriend’s sorority function and never wore it again. Why? Because I have a feeling that most of these types of stories that I read for items that I want to buy are complete bull shit. I’m not saying that everyone is lying, and the size. When describing the condition of your item, make sure to note of any blemishes, stains, etc. and make sure the details of these “defects” match the severity of the actual defect. Don’t make your item seem like it is in better condition than it actually is.  For sizing, a good added measure would be to include the measurements of the garment. I don’t do this as much as I should, but it really does help buyers out (I’ve gotten asked for measurements many times in the messages). Make clear what your return policy is as well. This is important in case there is a discrepancy between you and the buyer. Usually if there is a stain, etc. that I make note of in the auction

Shipping: Make sure your shipping is less than or about equal to the price that you actually pay. I’ll charge 5.50 to ship out most shirts, but from the two times I’ve done it, the worst part is filling out the customs form which only takes a minute or two. I have heard bad stories about shipping to certain countries (I’m looking at you Putin..), but I have not really had enough experience to back any of my claims on this matter. Add a tracking number as well to protect yourself from the buyer scamming you. 


Fees: As you keep selling on the site, which eBay states is against their policy). Paypal also takes 2.9% + $.30 from every single transaction before eBay fees (FYI: eBay owns Paypal; highway robbery at its finest). Buy it now fees are a little more complicated (see website for more detailed description; I’m pretty sure if you list a auction styled listing with a BIN and someone uses the BIN, you will only be charged with auction style fees). 

Offers: Buyers will often message you with offers to lower the price of the item. If you have room to negotiate and you want to just sell your item

I've lost quite a bit of weight since the last time I wore a suit (5 years ago)

Obviously, so my pants typically need to be hemmed.)

I'm also on a budget. I don't think I want to spend more than $150-200 on the whole outfit. If I get the new job, to avoid sinking money into a search that doesn't pan out.

Where can I get a suit relatively cheaply that won't look terrible? I'm not looking for GQ here

Also, pants, one or two shirts, and one or two ties. Maybe shoes, if I have to, but I do have a pair of decent black shoes at home that could look great with a proper polishing.

EDIT

**Other relevant info:** I've lost about 60 pounds since I last bought a suit, healthcare/insurance, and sales. 

ULTRA-LATE EDIT

**Final result:** I ended up going with Joseph A. Bank. I went there right after work and found a suit that I really loved. It was marked $895

The jacket is absolutely perfect

Thoughts: 

-Construction feels very solid

-I went TTS with a 9 (also a 9 in New Balance, Bass) and they fit perfectly. Not too large to cause slipping and after a day of wear there are no rubbing points.

-Are a larger profile shoe

-Only small issue is the weird triple stitch over the corner of the vamp (see pics)

Overall: Can't wait to wear these hard

1348938917.0,10o96l,Summary of the boots I have bought in the last 7 months,Acrimony01,100,30,101,"I thought it would be a good idea to post the boots that I have bought recently, and what I thought about a few of them.

**TRUE WORK BOOTS**

[Thorogood Round Toe w/ Vibram Sole – Tobacco - $100 – Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Thorogood-American-Heritage-Plain-Toe-Boot/dp/B002QQ8XB4/ref=pd_sbs_shoe_1 )

-A wonderful boot and one of the best deals I got. This is a true workboot and the color of the Tobacco leather is VERY versatile and looks good with white. Only shoe I chose with a marshmellow sole and vibram. 

[Vintage Shoe Company Hammond – Chocolate Brown - $140 – Last Call]
(http://www.lastcall.com/p/Vintage-Shoe-Company-Hammond-Lace-Up-Boot-Chocolate-Shoes/prod12710024/ )

-These were some of the last boots I bought. Very stylish and kind of a throwback to old school hiking boots. A rugged look

[Red Wing Iron Ranger – Hawthorne Rough Leather - $200 – Nordstrom] (http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/red-wing-iron-ranger-boot/3169385 )

-Gorgeous boots. They will change a lot over time

**HYBRIDS**

[Red Wing Beckman – Black Cherry - $230 – Revolve](http://www.revolveclothing.com/DisplayProduct.jsp?product=REDW-MZ17&amp;c=&amp;d=h )

-A classic for a reason. Very versatile

[Wolverine 1000 Mile – Rust - $200 – Amazon](http://www.freshestgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/wolverine-1000-mile-boot.png )

-Ordered seconds in brown. Got Rust. No defects. I AIN'T EVEN MAD. Chromexcel is ridiculously beautiful and these shoes flourish with them. I personally love the leather sole. It's a very simple and elegant work boot hybrid. 

[Land's End Canvas 8-Eye Boot – Brown - $50 – Land's End Canvas](http://www.freshbornmarket.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Lands-End-Canvas-Boots.jpg )

-I bought these because there is no way I can FIND Alden's affordably. You know what? They are great. Not exactly the best leather and I lost a lace hook already...but for less then $50 out the door? A great alternative. If anything

**DRESS BOOTS**

[Allen Edmonds Dalton – Walnut - $300 – Allen Edmonds](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/producti_SF0111_1_40000000001_-1 )

-Pure sex. Walnut is often imitated but never duplicated. AE has UNDERRATED boots. These are no exception and would put them against Church's and Tricker's any day. Most expensive boot so far. Nearly impossible to find a second and on sale.

[Allen Edmonds Long Branch – Grey - $270 – Allen Edmonds](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/producti_SF6021_1_40000000001_-1 )

-May be buying these in a few months. I want a grey boot and something wingtipped I can wear in the winter. These seem to fit the bill. Very unique without seeming pretentious. **Have not bought these yet**

[Allen Edmonds Ashbury Chelsea – Distressed Brown - $115 – Allen Edmonds](http://www.gordonshoes.com/productimgs/large/Allen-AE%20Ashbury%20Boot.jpg )

-I'm not a huge fan of Chelsea boots or pre-distressing

**CHUKKAS

[Sebago Fairhaven – Brown - $50 - Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Sebago-Fairhaven-Boot-Mens/dp/B0046G3SMG )

-In many ways like the LEC boot I bought. A hold over until I can afford Oakstreets or Quoddy's. These however

[Allen Edmonds Malvern – Brown Calf - $150 – eBay](http://i.shoebuy.com/pi/allen/allen385104_96387_jb.jpg )

-Classic dress Chukkas. What's not to like? A versatile color

[Clark's Mali Boot – Black - $110 – Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Clarks-Mens-Desert-Mali-Boot/dp/B004K6TOZW )

-One of my favorites. I avoid black but loved the matte thin leather on this shoe. They just work...Outstanding summer boot and frankly just very stylish. You must get these if they are on sale. I paid nearly full price and it was worth it. Can't say that about a lot of these boots.

[Clark's Desert Boot – Beeswax - $65 – Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Clarks-Originals-Mens-Desert-Beeswax/dp/B000WU8SBG/ref=sr_1_1?s=shoes&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348937356&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=desert+boot+beeswax )

-Hivemind didn't lie. Probably one of my most versatile boots. Put rawhide laces on them.

[Clark's Desert Boot – Olive Leather - $65 – Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Clarks-Mens-Desert-Olive-Leather/dp/B0040FOHOQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348937417&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=desert+boot+olive )

-I tend to avoid suede in boots and the CBD's were no exception. I felt like the leather had more character and it was nice to pick up something with that subtle green. Rawhide laces. Browns with these too.

[Clark's Desert Boot – Grey Leather - $65 – Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Clarks-Mens-Desert-Olive-Leather/dp/B0040FOHOQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348937417&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=desert+boot+olive)

-More gray! Versatile in a grey way...like the beeswax. Great with Jeans. I like these shoes when I want a boot but want to keep it low key. Once again always put rawhide laces on if you can.

[Tretorn Strala – Brown/Black - $25 – Sierra Trading Post](http://www.amazon.com/Tretorn-Mens-Strala-Vinter-Boot/dp/B003CYL3CU )

-Solid rainboot at a cheap price. No need to spend assloads on these. 


Let me know if ya'll have any questions.

**edit: Stereotypical edit. I totally halfassed this and you guys deserve better. I will try to get pics and take a good look at all the leather. I want everyone here to find a good deal and everyone to get the shoes they WANT at an affordable price. That's what FMF is all about. I'll do some reviews ASAP.**

Anyways it is what the title says free apparel every Tuesday. I am almost certain it is **U.S. only**. Granted, some Dockers and some Levi's, but Levi's are excluded in the free apparel Tuesday deal. I have found that Arrow clothing has somewhat nice fitted button up's. I mainly go for the button up's, polo's and pants, they don't have much else.

Steps to receive free apparel every Tuesday

Step 1: sign up for [Shop your way rewards](https://www.shopyourway.com/secured/rewards/join) you  might already be signed up if you signed up on Land's End website.

Step 2: Like them on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Sears.Outlet.Stores) or you could just go to their Facebook page every Tuesday to get the coupon. 

Step 3: Print the coupon. [Today's Coupon](http://i.imgur.com/RbL6L.jpg)

Step 4: Enjoy!

To find if there is a Sears Outlet near you here is a [Link](http://www.sears.com/shc/s/StoreLocatorView?storeId=10153&amp;catalogId=12605&amp;lid=IExTrans_FindStore&amp;rioptype=SC&amp;sid=IEx20120515TransactionalSRSDigitalReceipt2011&amp;eml=) Make sure you click Sears Outlet Stores only as that coupon only applies to Sears Outlet stores.

Remember, I just never find anything other than relaxed fit though. Treat Sears Outlet as a thrift store some of the items are damaged, but most are just out of season or something along those lines. I have been going every Tuesday for the past month and have never had a problem.

I hope this benefits someone out there.",self,t5_2s8e9,1337127218.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/tp3ll/free_apparel_every_tuesday_at_sears_outlet/

First off, but I'm not crazy about how one of the shoes has creased on the toe. I think this has more to do with the way I walk though because all of my leather shoes seem to do that on the left foot. Seems like a pretty good deal overall though so I figured I'd pass it along.

1. **Shoes.** You wear them everyday, etc within 6 months to a year, causing a cost per year of about $40-$80. In comparison, a pair of $200+ shoes will last about 3 years maintainence free, and can last over a decade with a $60 resole. That comes out to about $66/year without resoles, $38/year with resoles if you get a good pair.


 **With shoes

2. **Belt.** You probably wear it everyday. Same reason as shoes


3. **Coats.** This may be climate dependent, but researching quality matters. I have had winter coats only last a season, and I have a jacket that I have worn for three winters that shows no damage and shows almost no wear. I expect this $550 coat will last more than 10 years, whereas a less expensive $100 coat may last anywhere from one winter to ten. 

4. **Jeans and Pants.** I like Raw Denim

5. **Shirts and Undershirts.** OCBD's are great

**RULES:**

1. Post a description that accurately describes what you are selling.

2. Update your thread when something gets sold or is no longer available.

3. Post item condition and any images of the item (if available). Be as descriptive as possible when posting an item for sale or trade.

**NOTE: Please refrain from downvoting posts. The last few weeks has seen a big spike in postings, not downvote the competition.**

Suggestions:

- 99% of us use Paypal to facilitate these transactions. Gifting is fine, in almost a year of this reoccurring thread, I haven't heard of **any** fraudulent transactions. But just try to be smart about things.

- Please try to evaluate the ""fair market value"" of your items. No use in overpricing things and having them not sell. Check what the current selling price is on eBay to get a decent sense of FMV. Also know that retailers like JCrew, etc. have biweekly sales, so their MSRP is not the ""true price"". Adjust accordingly.

- Feel free to ask for answers or pictures about an item you are interested in. A good seller will always be willing to answer you in a timely matter.

I will preface this that I am no shoe expert. I don't own dub monks yet. No one has ever made a mold of my feet. They don't even know me by name on Saville Row (by face...of course, and by my eye better leather than Allen Edmonds.


So let me start at the beginning. They offer a **basic line of shoes** (Classic Collection), you don't pay the 20% tax that is included in the 160, so they end up being about $150 + shipping (so probably a bit less than $200).


The details on the classic line are that they use full-grain leather (calf from Annonay and Weinheimer Leder if you care) and are Goodyear welted (basically meaning they can be resoled multiple times). 


The classic line in store was quite impressive


The **suede** was what stunned me most. Apparently they use the same suede as Alden, but they had a pair of blue suede double monks that were just crazy sauce.


Anyway, so it should come as no surprise. In fact, [here](http://meermin.tumblr.com/image/20983395357) are all their lasts.


The real gem of the lower priced models (after everything suede) are the **double monks**. Less than $200 for high quality double monks is just absurd as far as I can tell. Both the [brown](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5l044gzUc1qb0bszo2_1280.jpg) and the [black](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzahsxY0fr1r3fk48o1_1280.jpg) were gorgeous. Of the leather oxfords


**Sizing** is a tad strange, but I was a 9.5 in the ""Hiro"" last. This requires a bit of work, but apparently you can email them what size you wear in a last (like an AE last) and they will tell you how they correspond to their sizing. What I found was that the sizes were similar to CDBs, so size down .5 to 1.


After the classic, you can expect to get these shipped for under $300. I must have stared at [these](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5466hhWWd1r3fk48o2_1280.jpg) and [these](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lwrxj7DOEW1r3fk48o1_1280.jpg) for 15 minutes each. Their light and dark brown are just everything you would want. This line also featured double monks with medalions, which I'm not sure I liked, but seemed unique at least (and not in the ""try too hard"" type way).


They have a [Norvegeese](http://www.meermin.es/catalogo2.php?id=8) line


They do have a small selection of [Shell Cordovan](http://www.meermin.es/catalogo2.php?id=9) models, which seems to be they way with me and cordovan leather.


They also offer **women's shoes**, so don't sweat it too much.


Lastly

So to sum up, so you could get two amazing pairs of shoes for the price of one pair of AEs (just over $300). Or you could split an order with someone. Note that their customer service is a tad slow (and via email only), but apparently good.

[Edit] Thanks for pointing it out

Friendly Gap employee here. I just got my stack of of F&amp;F coupons and since I have no one else to share the online codes with I'm giving them out to you guys! These codes will work from Thursday

Because I'm so committed to my job

* [Lived-in Slim Khaki](http://www.gapcanada.ca/browse/product.do?cid=42976&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=243639063). I love these pants so very much and wear mine all the time. There are a few colours that are already selling for more than 40% off but, but the grey is also very nice and versatile and the blues will basically go with whatever jeans go with. I probably don't need to point this out, but a lot of guys are wary of these because they think they will be like skinny jeans because of the word slim. They are not. I'm not a skinny guy at all, but they are more tapered in the leg and look great. Also they are ridiculously comfortable. Seriously consider these.

* [Ribbed Shawl Cardigan](http://www.gapcanada.ca/browse/product.do?cid=87272&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=350832003). This one may be a matter of taste, obviously), and is so soft and so comfortable. Also it apparently looks like something Daniel Craig once wore (according to a friend) so that has to be something, right?

* [Slim fit Jeans](http://www.gapcanada.ca/browse/product.do?cid=70024&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=350486003) and [Slim Fit Canvas Jeans](http://www.gapcanada.ca/browse/product.do?cid=70024&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=349812103). If you can fit into the Slim Fit jeans comfortably then you will look great in them. These are definitely skinnier than the Lived in Slim khakis. Full disclosure, then you should be fine. The canvas fit the same and can make for some pretty awesome casual looks with the right tops.

* [Straight Fit Jeans](http://www.gapcanada.ca/browse/product.do?cid=33182&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=243690003). These are my favourite jeans and if you aren't skinny enough to feel comfortable in the slims and don't need the extra thigh room in the Loose then consider these. For Gap jeans, even more so than some of my other Gap jeans. I also think the colour is a bit nicer in person than on the site.

* [Lived-in Wash Shirts](http://www.gapcanada.ca/browse/product.do?cid=42838&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=350759003). These aren't all that exciting, Gap shirts, while nice, probably aren't as exciting as pants, both in finding a great fit or exceptional quality for price. I do own and wear a variety of the Oxfords and like them, but they can often have that effect where tucked in they look fine but kind of 'dadish' and untucked they feel too long. 

* [Army Jacket](http://www.gapcanada.ca/browse/product.do?cid=48872&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=351279013). I bought this when it came in as a Spring jacket and I'm seriously loving it. I don't like the picture of it at all on the site, but is worth considering at $60.

* [Boxer Briefs](http://www.gapcanada.ca/browse/product.do?cid=15077&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=351259023). I was a very stringent boxer guy until I tried some of these. Seriously, go there. For one thing, there will probably be sale pairs kicking around for ~$4.97 (they are exactly the same in every way just last seasons designs and, seriously, who cares about that when it comes to underwear?).

I put a lot more effort into that than I thought I would. I hope someone finds any of that useful! Anyway, even if they don't end up using them. Hopefully this is enough for everyone! I'll try to grab any extra ones I can after my Sunday shift for some last minute sales!

    2) Note any additional discounts or perks if winner is an FMF'er (Free shipping etc...)
    3) Update your thread when something gets sold or is no longer available.
    4) Haggling can work here if the seller has the buy it now feature. Haggle the price to where both the seller and buyer feel it is appropriate. Seller will then revise the buy it now price and the seller can then buy it. 

Note: This is my first time doing this. Any additional suggestions are welcome

1340298273.0,ve0tu,[Review] Lands' End Canvas Jackson Chukka Boot - now $28.50,Metcarfre,54,10,17,"The [Lands’ End Canvas Men’s Jackson Chukka boot](http://canvas.landsend.com/pp/mens-jackson-chukka-boot~203389_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::DRC&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_sale-_-men-_-shoes-accessories&amp;origin=index) is clearly ‘inspired’ by the MFA staple

**Construction:**

The LEC chukka is rendered in soft suede. The suede used is of reasonable quality

The soles are in [soft crepe rubber](http://imgur.com/luBae)

With some trepidation when ordering I noted that the boot has a ‘cotton lining’; I was worried because for me, in this boot, the [cotton lining is restricted to the forefoot portion](http://imgur.com/F3pgr) of the boot, and not the heel. Yes, this means it will break down with time; but not as quickly or as noticeably if it had been fully lined as such.

Another drop in quality between this boot and a CDB is the insole. The insole is a clearly [glued-in construct](http://imgur.com/N35Q5) of paper with a veneer of cotton on top. This will likely break down with time.

**Styling:**

The LEC chukka is an almost carbon-copy of the iconic Clark’s Desert Boot, and even a casual suit. A very versatile piece.

**Sizing:**

These boots definitely run large. I am normally a classic 13 and occasionally 12.5 with some manufacturers

**Pricing:**

These boots is/were normally $95. However they have been [discounted to $37.99]( http://canvas.landsend.com/pp/mens-jackson-chukka-boot~203389_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::DRC&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_sale-_-men-_-shoes-accessories&amp;origin=index), you could do a lot worse. Note; the ‘sand’ colour I purchased is no longer available, you are restricted to ‘dark chocolate’ or ‘taupe’.

**TL/DR:**

**The Lands’ End Canvas Men’s Jackson Chukka boot is an excellent
