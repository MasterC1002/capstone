I've tried for the past week getting CommonQT up and running in several environments.  Windows involves arcane wizardry to build smoke which then commonqt.dll would wrap.  Not optimal but well it's WIndows and I'm trying to build some KDE internal I thought. I'll try it in linux.

I've tried several different versions of QT including the latest release 5.1.0.  Even after getting smoke

Are there any options I'm missing rather than 'give up and make it all webapps you idiot'?  If there was something like CAPI in FOSS land that would be ideal but it seems all the CAPI implementations are behind $1000+ licenses of commercial lisp environments (I'm looking at you LispWorks and Allegro)

  TL;DR: Tell me about Lisp and where/when It should be used over another language. 

  EDIT: Thank you for adding all of your input. I am going to try to get into Scheme. I really like having the ability to write my own macros.

It is built on top of Weblocks, and other CL libraries.

The author is also attempting to give back to the Lisp community. He [says](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.lang.lisp/zis1HFjkUrU/l8CEjNDK4-4J):

&gt; As my way of giving back to the Common Lisp community
5% commission on all bounties for work on Open Source Common Lisp 
implementations, for work on 
projects used by the BountyOSS site itself
3.5% to each bounty (this will cover the WePay credit card fees).  These include 
SBCL
post.  These two offers are good until midnight UTC of 1 January 2014. 

&gt; And finally, contribute an 
amount equal to the bounty) up to the following (cumulative) limits: SBCL
Quicklisp, $100; CLSQL, $100.  (I may add to 
this list later.)

The projects he states are

&gt; alexandria, babel, bordeaux-threads, 
cffi, cl-base64, cl-cont, cl-containers, cl-fad, cl-json, 
cl-ppcre, closer-mop, clsql, clsql-fluid, drakma, 
f-underscore, flexi-streams, html-template, 
hunchentoot, metatilities, metatilities-base, 
monkeylib-bcrypt, parenscript, puri, rfc2388, 
salza2, sb-posix, trivial-backtrace, 
trivial-features, trivial-timeout, 
uffi

Personally

&gt; The running total bounty for a proposal may or may not be displayed publicly; we leave this choice to the developer.

which I think detracts from the openness to the projects.

Something I like is that results can be evaluated. So, but rather the developer presents something, and the people who funded the project are allowed to evaluate, and those evaluations are weighted to determine how much the developer gets.

So I wrote a short outline of how I thought it could be used in a case study, and then a few days later I realized that `a need to write a Real Program in CL` + `a need for a science/engineering fair project` + `a new-found interest in genetic programming` had an obvious solution: a Real CL Program that researched the effectiveness of genetic programming.

You people very kindly helped me twice along the way--[when I had finished the tic-tac-toe engine and you improved it](http://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/fa13r/i_just_finished_my_first_cl_program_please/) and [when I was doing some tricky debugging](http://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/g7m5h/i_think_im_misusing_stack_traces/). Thank you. I also got some much-appreciated Emacs/SLIME-specific help [from /r/emacs](http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/g5vuc/a_few_random_questions/).

And now I've finished. **[Here's my code.](http://pastebin.com/aKGDZGxh)**

To run it: Load it into your favorite (and fastest) REPL, pass an argument into `test`. 2^9 takes about an hour on my computer. 16 takes a few minutes. If you want to play multiple games against the same AI, bind what `test` spits out to a variable. If you want to experiment, look at `test`'s source and make your own variant. If you want to see the (hundreds of) games the AIs play against each other, go to the function `faceoff` and change the last argument of the two `game-loop` calls from `nil` to `t`.

The AI I got from the 2^9 population was unfortunately pretty awful. I'm running `(test (expt 2 11))` overnight

**Overview of How it Works**

I have a list of chromosomes, mark a corner).

Many of these chromosomes are combined to make a gene. Then, finds out which cells it likes, and increments those cells' corresponding slots in a dictionary (which in the interest of simplicity is actually a 9-element array). Then the most popular cell in the dictionary is found, and the move it represents is the one that's used. (So if it's `#(3 2 6 4 2 7 4 6 1)`, the AI marks cell 6 / index 5 (which received 7 votes from the chromosomes.))

To pick the best AI, 100 matches against each other, alternating between who goes first. The individual that won the most advances to the next round, gets a new opponent, and so on and so forth until only one remains.

**Notes**

It'd probably be a lot better if once the AI won a game, this would require a major structural overhaul, and the afore-mentioned science/engineering fair is this Friday.

It'd also be nice if I split things into two files--one for the engine

But apart from those two issues

1279629841.0,crle9,My problem with the choice of Lisp dialect,woof404,29,3,65,"This is maybe a recurring topic

I started out with Clojure, made me want to change to another dialect.

I have done a couple of things in Emacs Lisp

I have chosen SBCL as my ""platform"" for Common Lisp and Chicken as my compiler for Scheme. So far

Now

With Scheme, I can problably learn to write some functions already embedded in Common Lisp in my own programs.

I am really at a crossroad here and would like to know: Am I doing a big mistake just discouraging Common Lisp for being so attached to dependencies? Do you fellow lispers think I will regret learning Scheme

I hear alot of people saying that even if you don't end up writing anything usefull in Scheme - it is a programming experience worth the time an effort. All that is good

**TL;DR:**

*  I Hate java and classpath-hell == No Clojure
* Unsure about Common Lisp and dependencies so considering Scheme - but can I do anything really usefull and productive out of it?

I have such a task and figured it might be good to cut my teeth with lisp on this task.  For background, dabbled in python, perl, php, and I've heard and read a great deal about lisp and its capabilities.  To that end I've read enough of PCL to know that I really want to understand this language.  I've only read into the 3rd chapter where he talks about functions and parameters, and I've also read a bit of sicp and htdp.  I am aware of a great many other texts that everyone suggests I should read and I've found it difficult to settle down and pick one and work through it.

Anyways, or maybe i'm sorely mistaken or haven't read enough.  And then pattern matching?

For intermediate-advanced users, upload, and document your own Chicken Scheme packages.

How does Racket compare to Chicken Scheme. I know that Racket (formerly PLT Scheme formerly Dr. Scheme) is designed as an educational Lisp but I haven't had occasion to sample it since Chicken works so well for my purposes.

I've had moderate success with Common Lisp; CLISP, though their relative lack of POSIX support (shebangs are a hack) finds them wanting.

With FP (and he used SML)

    datatype Animal = Cat | Dog;
    fun makeHappyNoise Cat = ""purr""
      | makeHappyHoise Dog = ""pant pant"";
    ...

So, he mentioned that the visitor pattern helped solve the problem nicely.

I recently went in during office hours and suggested that CLOS had what seems like an optimal solution, asked me to send him a copy of the source code, and suggested he might put in a line about CLOS in the textbook. Cool.

As a sidenote--do you think this is a fair representation of OOP, but I'm ignorant about it.

------

Now, we've been learning design patterns. Today he taught us Visitor. He enjoys posing a problem, demonstrating intuitive solutions (""tries""), and then having Try 3 or so be the ""correct"" way of doing things. So Try 1 featured an `if (foo instanceof Bar) baz(); else if (foo instanceof Quux) frobnicate();` mess. Try 2 featured, effectively, what would be multiple dispatch. He asked us what the problem was. I said that it didn't work in Java, and suggested that the world would be a better place if it did.

So he acknowledged that there were languages that supported that, and the only substance I got was:

1. The fact that Lisp doesn't have as extensive static checking as Java worries him.

2. There are cases where he finds multiple dispatch precedence unclear. If A and B implement I, then he says `(m (make-instance 'A) (make-instance 'X))` is undefined. I didn't know how to answer that this morning, but have since then figured out that ties are broken by the order of the arguments.


I'm too laid back to freak out about #1

But he's a smart guy

More generally

Have you ever had issues with the compiler not catching silly type errors that ended up burning you? Have you ever been confused by Lisp's dispatching? Is it sometimes helpful to have `visit()` and `accept()` written out explicitly? How helpful is it to have a toolbox full of design patterns, but I'm wondering if this is unhealthy.

1.  I sometimes have to write throw away tools that comb through a dataset and compute various stats.  I've built my own personal stats library for doing some of this.

2.  (just an idea) With some of our tools that are written in C or C++, I could write them in lisp format.  After the program finishes, I could run these files through a CL written tool that interprets the output file (lisp code) and does various things with it.  Has anyone ever done this?  Any tips or tricks?
