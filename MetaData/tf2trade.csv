----------------------------------------------------------------------------


I have uncovered evidence of extremely dubious activity by the person who runs the widely-used TF2 Pricing Spreadsheet, so I'll first summarize my findings as briefly as possible and then show the evidence.

* **Case 1**. The TF2 Spreadsheet admin bought a Strange Botkiller Medi Gun for 8 keys at a time when they were trading for less than 10 keys

* **Case 2**. The TF2 Spreadsheet admin apparently used anonymous shill accounts to attack competing spreadsheets and pricing sites

* **Case 3**. TF2 Spreadsheet admin apparently also used the same shill accounts to inflate prices of items that he was trading and to gain exposure for his own trades.

Now I'll present evidence for all these cases. It's a *very* long read

**Important** - A lot of the older evidence is in archived posts on the Steam Trading Forums (SPUF) at http://forums.steamgames.com. You MUST be logged into a Steam Forum account

Case 1: The mysterious case of the Strange Botkiller Medi Gun
--------------------------------

My first piece of evidence is based on this trade offer at TF2outpost: http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/3658466

First take a look at the item's ownership history: http://www.tf2outpost.com/item/1045336471

* STF2 and SmokedGouda001 are both accounts controlled by the TF2 Spreadsheet admin

* quintosj is the totally innocent seller of the Strange Botkiller Medi gun 

Here's the sequence of events in the order that they ocurred: 

* The Spreadsheet had no prices for any botkiller items before August 19th (i.e. before the Spreadsheet Admin traded 8 keys to buy one) - These two screenshots show this:  http://i.imgur.com/TcR6V.png   and   http://i.imgur.com/K0bSt.jpg 

* At that time, here's a list of buyout prices for the Strange Botkiller Medi Gun from TF2OP traders during the day before the Spreadsheet first created a price for that item. You don't have to read all these, but to me, these buyout prices very clearly suggest a price range BELOW 10 keys for this item at that time. (This list shows the state of these trades 24 hours ago. It includes all trades that had a clear buyout during that period and had not been bumped when I checked them). I also have screenshots in case they are edited.


|Buyout prices of Strange Botkiller Medigun **before** Spreadsheet intervention
|:-
|[5 Keys - Sold @ Unknown price](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/3650786) |
|[9 Keys - Sold @ 8 Keys](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/3658466)|
|[12 keys - Sold @ Unknown price](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/3644067)|
|['Some Keys' - Sold @ Unknown price](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/3655155)|
|[10 Keys - Not sold](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/3647708)|
|[Buds (26 Keys) - Not sold](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/3650233)|
|[TS Bills (10 Keys) - Not sold](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/3634070)|
|[Offer 7-10 Keys - Not sold](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/3668560)|

(Don't forget that most people will accept less than their buyout price, most of these traders seemed unable to find a buyer, and some had cut their prices)


* At this point, offering a strange botkiller medi gun for 9 keys, (his buyout price). Screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/dJHgg.png


* The Spreadsheet Admin then uses one of his accounts

* http://i.imgur.com/zjEuA.png  &lt;-- Confirmation that the Strange botkiller medi gun was traded to STF2 for 8 keys

* http://i.imgur.com/e2pXz.png  &lt;-- A new spreadsheet price of 10 -14 Keys for the Strange Botkiller Medigun is added immediately after the trade.

* After that time, as we have seen, this price range is artificial. It does not reflect the trading value of these items prior to the spreadsheet's intervention in the market - the price had clearly been falling as the supply increased, as one would expect.

* Next, as the item history now shows: http://www.tf2outpost.com/item/1045336471

* SmokedGouda001 then quicksells the Strange Botkiller Medi Gun for 10 Keys: http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/3687918 [(image)](http://i.imgur.com/4RkTx.png). Remember he paid only 8 keys for this, which normally pushes the price down fast). Of course, it's not so hard for him to quicksell, because the Spreadsheet price is causing most other traders to ask up to 14 Keys for the same weapon.

* Finally, he changes its price on his Spreadsheet to a new, much lower, price range: 9-10 Keys [(image)](http://i.imgur.com/HRoT3.png). I was capturing regular screenshots of this activity, but you can simply refer to the history of the item, to see that it left SmokedGouda's Backpack at the same time the Spreadsheet was updated: http://backpack.tf/item/1043034684 [(pic)](http://i.imgur.com/bNmoP.png) - [(same item at TF2OP)](http://www.tf2outpost.com/item/1043034684)



TL;DR?
-----

*The guy who controls the Spreadsheet bought an item for 8 Keys



*

--------------------------------

Cases 2 and 3 - Alt accounts and shill accounts
------------

The TF2 Spreadsheet admin has apparently used multiple alt accounts to attack competing pricing sites and to promote his own spreadsheet

Evidence strongly suggests to me that the TF2 Spreadsheet admin also used shill accounts to inflate prices of items he was trading and to increase interest in his own trades.

Case 2 and 3 are closely linked

Accounts controlled by the Spreadsheet Admin
-----------

There are **many** accounts apparently controlled by the Spreadsheet admin on various sites. Here is a list of the accounts which are important in this case. Later

Madking5150 / TF2S / STF2
------------------------

This account is used to handle items when the Spreadsheet has a promotional contest

http://steamcommunity.com/id/madking5150 

http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198037908684

*Note* that the Steam Forums Archives are a bit weird. You will probably need to be logged into the Steam Forums to see all the posts on these accounts

SmokedGouda001
---------------

This account is regularly used for trading. The owner appears to be making a great effort to conceal its connection to the spreadsheet.

[SmokedGouda's Steam Forums account](http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/member.php?u=933713)

Prellis_V2.0
----------

'Prellis_V2.0' is a Steam Forums (SPUF) account which was apparently used for a wide variety of underhand activities in the trading sub-forum. These seem to include: posting fake bids on trades by its owner's other accounts

The first thing you should know is that the Prellis_V2.0 account was very active in trading for several months

[Prellis_V2.0 Steam Forums account](http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/member.php?u=979535)

*Note* that the Steam Forums Archives are a bit wierd. You will probably need to be logged into the Steam Forums to see all the posts on these accounts

Fact: The accounts SmokedGouda001 and 'Madking5150/STF2'
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SmokedGouda001 himself [admitted on SourceOP to controlling both accounts (where he says 'both my backpacks')](http://www.sourceop.com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;p=589040#58904)[.](http://i.imgur.com/E4vn9.png) I guess this is a slip up by SmokedGouda


What links these accounts to the Spreadsheet?
--------------------------------------

Firstly there is a huge amount of circumstantial evidence

Secondly, proving that this account is controlled by the Spreadsheet's admin, and therefore that SmokedGouda001 is also the same person.

For example, as you can see from their profile). The item history for that key shows it passing from SmokedGouda001, to STF2, to Nameless.  Here it is: http://www.tf2outpost.com/item/895088688


Anonymous promotional posts
-------------------------

In these posts, but it provides further evidence that this kind of underhand behavior is common for this person,. And it shows that these many accounts and the Spreadsheet, are controlled by the same person. There are dozens of these posts around on TF2-related sites, here are just a few of them:

[Gamefaqs](http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/437678-team-fortress-2/59538786?page=4),](http://i.imgur.com/bqpqf.png) [Steam Forums](http://forums.steamgames.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2270365&amp;page=2)[,](http://i.imgur.com/sHaQn.png) [Facepunch](http://facepunch.com/threads/1061512), [SourceOP](http://sourceop.com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;p=658194&amp;highlight=#658194) -- note his last comment: ' this one is very good'.

Anonymously attacks competing spreadsheets and opponents of the Spreadsheet
-------------------------------------------------------------------

What happened to alternative Pricecheck sites like Bills and Buds? Well

[Madking and Prellis_V2.0 both immediately attacked Vathian and his new Bills and Buds site](http://forums.steamgames.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2201619&amp;page=4  )[(image)](http://i.imgur.com/CpfPN.png). Madking claims to have 1750 hours in TF2. (In fact


Why do I believe Prellis_V2.0 is associated with the Spreadsheet?
----------------------------------------------------

Well

On 25 August 2011

The only reason Prellis has for posting this comment is to bump the thread back to the top and promote the spreadsheet

And notice how in that last link Prellis and Madking (who are actually the same person)



Why do I believe the accounts SmokedGouda001
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We've already seen SmokeGouda admit that he is Madking/STF2

Despite many months of activity, but *Prellis_V2.0 never actually buys anything from SmokedGouda*. In fact, in the majority of his 84 posts over several months, Prellis only does two things: (1) [Attempts to trade with SmokedGouda](http://i.imgur.com/TGGtk.png) (2) [Promotes the Spreadsheet and attacks its competitors](http://i.imgur.com/hDGFM.png). Can anyone show me any other account which is so bizarrely focused on two such apparently unrelated issues to the exclusion of all else...?

I believe the sole purpose of the Prellis_V2.0's trading posts is to inflate the value of SmokedGouda's items

This evidence already seems overwhelming to me. There is no rational explanation for the activity of the Prellis_V2.0 account, Madking/STF2, and Prellis_V2.0, are in fact all controlled by the same person. There's additional circumstantial evidence, but I suspect this is already way too long for most people to read, so I'll just leave it there for now.

(Someone asked-- ""TC"" is a Team Captain

Yep

I take more security precautions than surely anyone does with their Steam account. I've interviewed 90% of the people hijacked over the holidays in the long string of account hijackings and put together guides and info to help people avoid hijackings.

The hijacker IM'd my friends who talked to him

Here's the sort of stuff I do to secure my account and it wasn't enough. It may have just delayed the inevitable:

* SteamGuard enabled always (of course)
* My steam username is different than other known names for me
* My steam email is different than my other known emails for me
* I use GMail-based email accounts
* I use a complex password that is different from other sites
* I run three forms of malware protection (Malwarebytes
* Since the holiday hijackings began in earnest
* I get added by lots of people and never click on a link that looks even slightly suspicious

I know for a fact that any sufficiently motivated attacker with enough time will always get their 50/50 chance to get into any account at some point. This fellow was motivated and found someway to bypass all of those approaches.

**Edit1:** My profile (now just backpack) just went private

**Edit2:** It's 7am my time now and I'm headed to bed. My answers are probably getting sleepy-incoherent anyway. :(

**Edit3:** A very nice and pleasant Valve employee who happened to be working the weekend locked the account at ~11am

**Edit4:** I'm back in my account

**Edit5:** **The hacker used personal information about me to convince Steam Support he was me and get them to give their account to him. So none of the above technical approaches fell victim

**Edit6:** I have most of my items back


**Edit7:** I got this note supposedly from the hijacker himself: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfmLDQ13DgY&amp;feature=youtu.be

Note that: 

* Steam required him to provide more information than just my email
* Of course anyone could be hijacked. Anyone who knows much about security knows that it's just a matter of time that it will fall if someone is determined enough. :( I just wish he'd put his cleverness to use solving more substantial problems and making money that way than causing unhappiness for people. :(

**You need to read this

**Your economy is being manipulated for a long time.**

Please also point out the mistakes in the proof if there is any. 

Discussion for /r/tf2trade 

* When did the Russians mentioned **start injecting** keys into the market? Fall 2011 when Buds started to rise? Summer 2012? Before Halloween? For sure it is not yesterday.

* What if such injection of Keys **is the main cause** of indefinite decrease in value of Keys for the past 2 years?

* What if such method of injecting Keys **is the main cause** of the dramatic increases of the Price of Earbuds in terms of **both USD and Key value**?

* Do you prefer such Keys being constantly injected into the market?

* What should we do as legit traders?

* What should have been done to the Store purchasing system if you were given authority?

**How does this work?**

You are given a random match (your **giftee**) whom you must gift to. Another person will be randomly matched to gift you something (your **secret santa**). You can gift anything from hats to games

Be creative! Stalk your receiver's account to get an idea of their favorite class, this is meant to be fun!


**Is there a minimum/maximum spending limit?**

There is a **2 reclaimed** value minimum for gifting so people don't sign up just to get free things and ruin the spirit of the event. There is no maximum spending limit. 

--------------------------

**How do I sign up?**

Signing up is easy! Just follow the instructions below:

**^Please ^note

**1)** Send a [message to Steambot (click here)](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Steambot&amp;subject=Secret%20Santa) with ""Secret Santa"" as the subject and your SteamID64 as the message. A guide on how to get your 
SteamID64 can be read [here](http://redd.it/1404y7).


*Please make sure your SteamID64 does ****not*** *have a forward slash (/) at the end of it

**2)** Steambot will send you a verification string

**3)** Wait 5 minutes for Steambot to check your profile and send you back a message and you're done! Well done



----

[Here's a video for this event made by our very own rolmos!](http://vimeo.com/54570790)

Signups for the event will last untill December 6th

The match you receive in your Reddit inbox will be the person you'll have to send a gift to. **The gift must be of at least 2 reclaimed in value, and other digital items, but there's no limit! 

*Gaming the system or intentionally receiving and not giving is considered an act of dishonesty that will result in the offender being marked a scammer by SteamRep.*

---

Proper story's supposed to begin at the beginning, but he ain't complaining. He never was one for talkin' much.

---
**New items**

I guess since the calamity most people don't use real currency. Just barter instead. Guess I'm just old fashioned.

* **Pocket Purrer - 1.33 ref**

Cute little thing don't like to be alone. Likes to travel though. Sits in this pouch and purrs contentedly. Innocent eyes wide at the world. Loyal too. 

* **Blokes Bucket - 1.33 ref**

Ain't much fish to catch nowadays. Don't people from going fishin' though. Guess fish never were the point anyway.

* **Pyro's Beanie - 1.33 ref**

Ain't always much to say.

---


* **Strange Liberty Launcher (Crit Kills

Knocked the kid right off his feet. Maybe leave it for another time.

* **Strange Stickybomb Launcher - 1 rec (x2)**

Some people let the enemies come to them. No harm in being prepared.

* **Strange Big Earner - 1 rec**

Some people convince others they're one of their own before they strike. Even the kid don't like to get that close.

---

* **Black Paint (A distinctive lack of hue) - 2 keys + 2 ref**

Calamity redecorated everything. Just gotta rebuild. Paint's scarce though. 


---

Guess most of this junk's gonna be here a while. Just rust and wreckage.

* **Strange Parts: Robots Destroyed 1 key 0.55 ref**

Some people like to count what they kill. Kid ain't much for that and I ain't much for killing.

* **Strange Parts Kills: Whilst explosive jumping - 2 rec**

Some people don't walk. They just about fly. Seem to get around faster that way

* **Strange Parts: Sappers Destroyed - 1 ref 1 rec**



---

**SOLD**

Some stuff goes quicker than others. Kid records it in his diary. Suppose he's lost enough already

* ~~Strange Pistol - 1 rec~~

It's no repeater

* ~~White Bills - 10 keys~~

Thought we finally found kid something to tame his hair. No such luck. The fine material looked nice though. Probably belonged to some fancy pants. Ain't got much use for that kind of thing 'round here.

*  ~~All father (Uncraft

Thing looked like a Santa beard. Big

* ~~Made Man - 2 ref~~

A real rose. Don't know how it survived the calamity. Best give it away if we want it to survive

* ~~Capo's Capper 1.33 ref~~

Found it on a Gasfella. Suppose he thought himself real tough. Kid popped him good.

* ~~Tricorne 1.33 ref~~

Robbed a scumbag of his last meal. Took his hat as well. Ain't worth much. But it's better than nothing.

* ~~Dr Whoa - 3.66 ref~~

Sometimes


* ~~Gold Botkiller Wrench - 6.5 keys~~

Kid found a Squirt playing with this. Shiny thing ain't much of a play toy. We gave it a ball instead. Well

* ~~Rust Botkiller Minigun - 2.55 ref~~

Thing's covered in rust

* ~~Genuine K-9 Mane - 1.33 ref~~

Not everyone retained their sanity. Some went back to the old ways

* ~~Strange Sniper rifle - 2.33 ref~~

Kid likes to get up close. Guess it ain't everyone's style. 

* ~~Tour of Duty Ticket - 1.22 ref~~
A ticket to hell itself. Worse than even the who-knows-where. But someone's gotta go.

* ~~Green Paint - 0.66 ref~~

I ain't gonna begrudge a man who wants to blend in. Standing out? Not always wise. Guess the kid ain't never learned that lesson. Probably never will.

* The trader was selling co orange paint

* The trader asked what was it about, stating that this is just bad trade reputation, the trader smirked that- I quote: ""bad rep is removed from tf2outpost"". As if it really mattered.

* I cancelled the trade. I also added my experience in the trade thread and his profile

* Later tonight

* ""You have been banned until 16:36:31 GMT on 6th March

* **Like I said

* Turns out the trader

* I think I laughed, no matter how hard they try for the opposite.

* I will continue using tf2outpost for my future trade requests

* **EDIT**. Potatosol agreed to trade his orange paint for the same price without banning anyone in the process. Thank you reddit.

* **EDIT No2**. I finaly have **the orange hat I always wanted**. You can **check it out** [here](http://tf2b.com/item/76561198004569195/45101196). What is bizarre

Asks me for the price of one of my unusuals. Wants to check that my unusual is not duped and sends me a link, less than 15-20 seconds pass, I re-open the trade window and see that it says ""trade completed"" and freak the fuck out, a split second later, he deletes me.

Anyways,  the thing is that it happened in less than 30 seconds between me clicking the link and him stealing my 6 earbuds and [Unusual Defiant Spartan \(searing plasma\)](http://www.tf2items.com/item/708322732) 

Here's the conversation: http://i.imgur.com/qDFIq.png

***TL;DR:  don't click on any links within TF2.***

*Edit*:  To clear some things up:

-I did not have to log into anything after clicking the link.  I just clicked it and a pop up window came up saying it was checking my bp and might take a while.

-I did not have any items in the trade window.  He had to have added the items himself and completed the trade himself.  I am guessing that he tailor made a script to add the specific items I had (earbuds) and then complete the trade since it happened so quickly.

-By the time you read this I hope he's listed as a scammer on steamrep


*Edit2*:  After talking with a few others I am going to guess that this scammer wrote a specific script that added the earbuds and unusual and completed the trade by itself.  The scammer was after my unusual Defiant Spartan which I have never advertised as for sale

We all told him it was

The scammer asked him to pick a middleman. Because no /r/tf2trade mods or SteamRep middlemen were online at the time

The scammer surprisingly agreed (I don't have SteamRep status and only 2 middleman rep) - and I was dragged into the chat.

I check the other guy's profile - private. No rep. Obviously this raised some red flags

A while afterwards, the scammer used an injection scam and got the guy to impersonate me quickly after he agreed on me being the middleman.

1352053623.0,12mdu4,[PSA] An advice-filled rant from a veteran trader.  Kind of a semi-guide.,varrogath,140,14,95,"Hello

I’ve been planning on writing a guide for some time now

However

I apologize if the content of this post seems kind of random/disorganized.  I’m speaking my mind here

Anyway

I’m hoping to clear some things up in this post

**First off

(Be sure to sign in to tf2items.com or register there first).

[I have been playing TF2 since the very beginning.](http://www.tf2items.com/item/78656744)

[This is what my BP looked like before I started trading.](http://www.tf2items.com/id/Varren?time=1312176161)

[And this is what it looked like 1 year later.](http://www.tf2items.com/id/Varren?time=1343877992)

Quite the difference

Now

**“Oh look

But that is not at all my intent.  My BP isn’t even remotely close to being impressive compared to the true kingpins of the TF2 trading world.

Still, and I’d like to share my thoughts with some less-experienced traders.

**”So

These are

**1. Luck**

**2. Persistence/Time Investment**

**3.  Professionalism/Politeness**

I’ll go through each one in-depth.

First off

I won’t lie; I got extremely lucky many times throughout my trading career.  Some examples (feel free to skip down to “the point”)...

When I first started buying and selling craft hats

One day

[Lo and behold...](http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/558686202376963744/7B105DF1E1D70A0691F2C796813D7E7FC7329ED8/)

I ended up selling it for around 10 Keys.  Practically doubled my backpack’s value just like that.

And so began my love affair with hat crafting.

I started crafting hats together more regularly, Team Captain, Dr. Whoa, and so on.

I didn’t *just* get good items.  I got plenty of crappy hats too.  But overall I gained more than I lost.

One day I ended up crafting the #4 Surgeon’s Side-Satchel.  I didn’t even know about craft numbers

I ended up trading it for my first Unusual: Steaming Your Worst Nightmare.  This was when I realized how much better it was to craft things together only when new items were released.

And so I began hording craft hats like crazy.  I had over 300 craft hats and miscs when the Pyromania update was released.

[The results of my Pyromania crafting spree.](http://imgur.com/a/1j905#0)

I ended up trading about half of them for 2 Buds total.  Four of the lowest crafts were traded for a Smoking Dragonborn Helmet.

Another good example of me getting lucky was when I got invited to the DotA 2 beta very early on

None of my friends wanted to play with me

**Luck - The Point:**  Luck is a *major* factor in how successful you are.  Whether it’s randomly unboxing a valuable unusual

Now

Nor should you avoid taking risks altogether.  **The important thing is to be careful with what risks you take.**  Hat crafting is, and can pay off early on.

The other thing to take away from this is to **not feel bad if you’re not making profit as fast as you wish you were.**  You can be offering a fair price for craft hats/weapons/whatever

This brings me to my next point: **Persistence/Time Investment**

Basically, the more successful you will be.

I’ll be honest.  One of the big reasons I’ve been so successful is that I’m an unemployed college drop-out.  I spend almost all day at my computer, looking around for any good deals, and organizing my inventory.

When buying Unusuals especially

I payed $10 to obtain the donator rank on TF2 Outpost.  That means I can have 25 different trade posts open at once

The more time you spend creating and bumping your trades

I use TF2 Outpost, TF2 Bazaar, **and** r/tf2trade to advertise my wares.

Back in the day

[Here’s an example of one of the hat-buying posts I used to have.](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/3119544)

So

**”Am I really putting in the effort needed to make the amount of profit I want to make?”**

And adjust your trading strategies accordingly.  If you’re lazy and just hope that you get a lucky break

**”Yeah

So LOWER YOUR FREAKING EXPECTATIONS!  No one is going to become a millionaire by trading virtual hats!  Even with all the time I put into trading

**Persistence/Time Investment - The Point:**  For most people, then congratulations, you’ve accomplished more than I ever have.

However, then you’ve got to **make yourself stand out.**

Which brings us to my last point: **Professionalism/Politeness**.

Unfortunately

Anyone who has spent a decent amount of time on TF2 Outpost can surely attest to this.

It seems obvious

**YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN TF2 TRADING IF YOU ACT LIKE A WHINEY

Seriously

If you act like a prick

Does that mean you should be *excessively* nice and friendly?  Of course not.  That will make you seem obnoxious.

So

Be nice and respectful towards people who are nice and respectful towards you.

If someone starts insulting you or treating you with disrespect

If someone makes an insulting post in your TF2 Outpost trade post

If someone adds you and it turns out they did not read the trade notes and get mad at you

**You want to build a positive reputation for yourself.**

[Take a look at my steam profile.](http://steamcommunity.com/id/varren)

Notice the 60 pages of people saying “+rep”.  I have gone out of my way to make trading a pain-free experience for people.  I make my trade notes very clear and respond to Friend requests as soon as possible.

I have had many

It got to the point where I even made a steam group just for people who traded with me on a regular basis.

I go out of my way to format my posts on TF2 Outpost and r/tf2trade in such a way that they are extremely comprehensive and easy to read/understand.

I constantly ask myself

Obviously there have been times when I’ve gotten into some very heated arguments with people

You *are* going to make *someone* angry at some point.  Don’t worry about it.  [Haters are going to hate.](http://i.imgur.com/MVOIR.gif)

**Professionalism/Politeness - The Point:**  It doesn’t take much to make yourself stand out from the masses on TF2 Outpost.  Most of my advice on being respectful and polite should just be common sense.

**Final Thoughts**

The art of TF2 trading is more complicated than it seems.  Just figuring out *what* to buy and sell can be confusing enough.  But it is just as important to think about *how* you conduct yourself in the world of TF2/Steam trading.

If the trading scene is stressing you out

I also recommend just asking yourself, do I want to accomplish with TF2 trading?”**

If you’re not going to try and make a living from online trading

I hope I’ve helped at least someone out here.  If not

If people still have some concerns or questions

These are just my personal thoughts and comments and I don’t expect everyone to agree with them.

Full text of blog post:


Bidwell was taking stock of some of our older merchandise this week and found out some idiot's been using one of our warehouses to store pallets of spoiled mayonnaise. Raccoons all over the place. Fancy Fedoras, let me tell you.

Here's a complete list of all the stock we lost: BATTER’S HELMET, DEMOMAN’S FRO, FOOTBALL HELMET, MINING LIGHT, PRUSSIAN PICKELHAUBE, TROPHY BELT and FANCY FEDORA. That's right, folks: These hats are gone. 

For the next two weeks, I don't know if you can get rabies from wearing a hat that a raccoon bit, but if you can don't come crying to me about it. If you don't want your hats to give you diseases, don't buy them out of warehouses, that's my advice. That's just one of the reasons I wear as few clothes as possible at all times. Never been sick in my life.
 


**Item retirement FAQ**


Q: What is happening to this set of nine hats in two weeks?  
A: These items will no longer be sold in the store, or acquired through crafting.

Q: What happens to copies of these items that are already in my backpack?  
A: All existing copies of the items will remain unaffected.

Q: What about older crates that have these items as a potential drop?  
A: Crates that contain these items will still have a chance at unboxing them in normal quality only.

Q: How will I now acquire these items?  
A: These items are still useable in trading.

Q: Will these items ever come out of retirement?  
A: No. Once an item is retired it will stay that way.

Q: Will more items be retired in the future?

We are working to make it so your flair here will match your SR. This will help us mods determine who are scammers and who needs to go. It will also help you know at least at a glance who has neutral rep. 

Right now we are looking at a system where you will sign in through steam and then confirm your reddit name. That is all that is going to be required and should be only a 1 time thing.

Once you set your profile, I am also working on a system for detecting this, so within the future that will not be an issue.

I removed the post because it incorrectly is causing a false sense of panic.

First of all

Valve dislikes one sided trading. This is because it makes it harder for them to track hijackers and other people who steal items from people. So who is really effected by this?

Two classes of people:

1. Middle men
2. People who do a lot of buying and selling of items over PayPal.

Why is this? Because middlemen generally receive an item without trading for it and then pass it on to another person who does not give anything in return. These sort of transactions raise flags at Valve because this looks like the item may be moving from a hijacked account.

As far as people who deal in big scale paypal transactions

With that said

The **occasional** PayPal transaction **should not get you trade banned outright**. Usually there must be some interaction with a hijacked or stolen item.

The other way you may be trade banned, Valve will see that you accepted nothing via Steam Trade and it looks like you have scammed/received an item from a hijacked account.

**So what should you do?** Simple. Check all items before you trade, you *should* be okay. But what is the best practice? Always trade for in-game items.

I want to note **this is NOTHING NEW**! Back when I used to trade (like over a year ago)

The auction system has been completely overhauled. I added the feature on a whim during initial development and didn't really put any effort into making it. There was no incentive to deliver on auctions and in general the feature was pretty useless. In January, as it wasn't common for us to have inane starting bids as 50% of the daily report quota. Finally, Decision Time was modified to start when the auctioneer logged in so they would have no excuse to select a highest bidder.

The actions of an admin who is no longer with us inspired me to go for a system where it's hard to break rules. I have been looking over the rules and I effectively removed half of them by merging them or coding something in to make the rule redundant. You can even list quickbuys now - they'll just be completely invisible to users who enable a certain feature.

Miscellaneously

However, but thousands of people, in unison, also say ""it has no userbase, so I'll go elsewhere"".

The reason I made this is because I'm partially worried people used the site during the production periods where the site was very slow due to poor caching and features weren't as great as they were, just because of a poorly designed backend.

______________________________________________

We've all been there, this is a raffle for **ONLY** newer players, or those who are not overly tf2-wealthy.  As simple as it sounds, it's been really hard to define exactly what that means, and I'm still not entirely sure about it.  For now, there are a couple of qualifications you must (roughly/somewhat) meet before entering:

- Currently possess no more than one earbud/unusual in your backpack .  This going to be a pretty hard thing to determine in whole

- Less than 500 hours of tf2 played.  Compared to the first rule

Please don't look too much into these as there are plenty of exceptions

______________________________________________________

Now

1. Pick any number between 1-500

2. Come up with a unique number.  If two people were to pick #41

3. **Please do not enter if you are planning on reselling for profit.** I am putting extra emphasis on the rule this time around as I really want this hat to end up with someone who will truly appreciate it.

4. Post a link to your steam page if it's not already in your flair (this also helps with evaluating everything previously listed)

5.  Try not to downvote others - it's silly and won't increase anyone's odds of winning.

_____________________________________________________________

I may re-open the raffle a couple of different times over the next day or two depending on how long it stays on the front page.  In order for everyone to have the chance to enter

That should about do it.  Winner will be chosen on Friday around 12pm EST via www.random.org

this is why:

the only way one can acquire keys (outside of buying them from other traders) is to spend two dollars and fifty cents in the mann co store. this means we can safely assume that keys are worth 2.50.

keys = 2.50

when people trade refined for keys

1 refined = 1 dollar

now we get into the promos. earbuds are classically sold over paypal for somewhere between 30-35$. earbuds can also be traded for 26 keys. (what the fuck, which is also ridiculous. 

at the moment these are just some observations

anyways

my first suggestion would be to start selling buds for 12 keys as opposed to 26. 

12 keys = 30$

obviously people would take a price hit to start

Yes, I do not care. I'll do that shit anyway.

Pretty cool

All I ask of you guys is two things.

1. I need to gauge your interest! Let me know here if you'd be up for watching a stream of this/getting onto the server. The stream part is not quite as important

2. **THIS IS EXTREMELY OPTIONAL AND WILL IN NO WAY AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF THE RAFFLES OR ANYTHING ELSE!** If you're feeling generous

    422 crates (+24! Thanks Lieutenant Huffman! +54! Thanks pragmatic[00]!) **Do not need more crates! Thanks so much!**

    396 keys

&amp;nbsp;

The crates should be no problem, as it means I can get to main the event sooner! Even a single key would be absolutely amazing of you.

*I will not be buying more than 500 keys if I get more than 500 crates.* Sorry, I will not be keeping any for myself for trading, and will obtain more crates until all the keys are used up. *Any uncrates above 500 will automatically be donated/raffled, regardless of whether I get 8 unusuals or a bunch of expensive hats/weapons from them.*

**The uncrating and raffles will happen regardless of whether or not I get donations.** I know I basically said that already but I really want to emphasize these are completely optional and I only mention them in case there are some people out there who are feeling generous.

I haven't set a date for this yet

In the meantime, please get in touch with me! I've had someone offer to set up a server for this but I'd like to know what I'm doing just in case that falls through. Not putting all my eggs in one basket and all that.

This is the first time that I have done this

*Hat / Miscs counts* - 130+   

Without further ado
* I will be using the prices of hats from the spreadsheet

* If the spreadsheet lists a hat with a +/-, e.g. 1.66 - 2.00 ref, I will take the middle value of it. So the hat value will be 1.83 ref. 

* You may use your less- liked craftable hat to exchange for a hat that you like. * If you want a more valuable hat
 
In order to keep this hat bank always abundant with hats

* A service fee of 1 scrap will be charged. Rest be assured

**Some special cases:**  (only apply to my hats on sale

* Special level hats such as level 1, 99 will cost an additional 2 rec. 
* Level 100 hats will cost an additional value of 1 ref.
* The cheaper paint hats will be only an additional charge of 1 scrap.
* Hats with white paint will cost an additional of 1.5 key or 3.33 ref. 
* Hats with Slime paint will cost an additional 1 ref.
* Hats with Team Spirit will cost an additional 1 ref. 
I shall build on this list if I have other painted hats in my backpack. 

**In summary**

* for each hat

* If you are buying with metal

**Hat control**

In order to keep the hat bank healthy for everyone to use, in order to promote the removal of these hats, service fee will not be applied to these overflowing hats (i.e. when there are 4 of them in the backpack) when exchanging a hat for them!! 


I hope that this service can help people to easily get the hats they want from my backpack with a very low fee. And once again

12:39 AM - /r/TF2Trade Secret Santa: Should be all 50


The best thing about this gift? It was just a disguise. Right after completing the trade, but still accepted the trade.

12:40 AM - /r/TF2Trade Secret Santa: The fists were a disguise!



And then he added 2 games: Trine 2 and Just Cause 2. I -really- wanted Trine 2 (couldn't afford it though)

I'm really happy about the gifts that I received (inb4 fisting jokes). Even though my original secret santa decided not to deliver

I would've posted on [/r/tf2gifts](/r/tf2gifts) but there aren't too many readers there and I was told it would be better if I posted here.

1363558439.0,1ahkc3,"[PSA] Take your trading with you, wherever you go. Introducing Mist - a portable, open-source Steam client that lets you chat with friends and trade TF2 items anywhere!",waylaidwanderer,112,70
Mist is a portable
Mist is something I decided to write because I love doing trades, and would miss out on business deals.  
So Mist is intended to be a solution for that. It's portable and doesn't require Steam
Mist is built on top of SteamBot (https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamBot/) and heavily uses its underlying functions to handle chat and trading. And of course
Scroll to the bottom for the source-code and download link.

###Features###

**MIST IS STILL VERY MUCH IN BETA.** Expect bugs, important trades at the moment, just to be on the safe side.

[Screenshots Gallery](http://imgur.com/a/Lwlwc)

* Works with SteamGuard - no need to disable it to use Mist  
* Chat with friends  
* Trade TF2 items - you are limited to trading only TF2 items for now. Adding other types of items will cause the trade to expire.  
* Change display name and status  
* Add friends  
* Block/ignore friends  
* Backpack viewer - view anyone's backpack directly from within the program!  
* SteamRep Checker - check any of your friends' SteamRep status  
* More to come?  

###What doesn't work###

* Friend requests are not shown in Mist. You will have to accept/ignore them manually via steamcommunity.com. This feature will be implemented in a later release  
* Can only trade TF2 items  
* Occasionally adding items will cause the trade to crash and expire. This is rare but it happens. Close the chat tab
* Searching for friends - this is planned for a later release  
* **Linux support** - unfortunately Mist is not compatible with Linux

1320004314.0,luc4d,So you want to buy or sell an item for cash! Here's a guide!,musical_hog,109,14,51,"Congratulations! You have gained enough experience to begin buying and selling virtual items for real money! Here's an entirely too long guide I tossed up to help you on your way. If you're confused

## ***Where to start: appraise your item! Please note: we will be using USD as the base currency.***

*****

Whether you're hoping to sell a single refined metal or a handful of top-tier unusual hats

**Item value** is determined by using certain key components of the TF2 item universe as units of currency. The units of currency and their relative values is as follows:

&gt;* Refined metal -- one refined
&gt;* Mann Co Supply Crate Key -- 2.44 - 2.55 refined
&gt;* Bill's Hat -- 20 - 25 refined
&gt;* Mac OSX Earbuds -- ~52 - 55 refined or ~24 keys
&gt;* Unusual hats -- At worst

These item prices are fluid, [TF2 Outpost](http://tf2outpost.com), and trade servers (RUGC trade, anyone?) are great places to keep up on the average item price of other items.

**Cash value, but it's a close approximation. We use the value of the smaller forms of currency to help us price the value of larger forms. A lot of times, you will see earbuds going for $32, but 60 (refined) x $0.6 = $36. You can usually buy items from the cash market for less than in-game because you cut out the work involved with converting (buds, in this example) items into smaller forms of currency to sell. It is best to visit [SourceOP.com's item buying/selling subforum](http://sourceop.com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewforum&amp;f=21) in order to stay on top of current market price. 

&gt;* Refined metal -- $0.40 - $0.50
&gt;* Mann Co Supply Crate Key -- $1.15 - 1.35
&gt;* Bill's Hat -- $11 - $13
&gt;* Mac OSX Earbuds -- $30 - $35
&gt;* Unusual hats -- Anywhere from ~$15 to ~~$1500 (maybe even more!)~~ (a burning Team Captain sold for what amounts to $1500 cash + 2500 in unusuals

Appraising an unusual hat is a sometimes confusing task, and particle effects. The following is a **rough** look at how each class and effect falls, from least-desired to most-desired. For brevity's sake, we will leave out the complete list of hats. This is not a catch-all! There are plenty of instances in which these hierarchies will fail! ***When in doubt, ask an admin, and then ask a few more!***

*Least-desirable -- Heavy --&gt; Spy --&gt; Engineer --&gt; Sniper --&gt; Pyro --&gt; Demoman --&gt; Medic --&gt; Scout --&gt; Soldier -- most-desirable*

*Least-valuable -- Logo --&gt; Confetti --&gt; Peace --&gt; Nutz and Bolts --&gt; Flies --&gt; Bubbles --&gt; Searing Plasma--&gt; Orbiting Planets --&gt; Orbiting Fire --&gt; Steaming --&gt; Smoking --&gt; Vivid Plasma --&gt; Cauldron Bubbles --&gt; Blizzardy Storm --&gt; Flaming Lantern --&gt; Haunted Ghosts --&gt; Eerie Orbiting Fire --&gt; Circling Heart --&gt; Stormy Storms --&gt; Energy --&gt;  Scorching Flames --&gt;  Sunbeams --&gt; Cloudy Moon --&gt; Burning Flames -- most-valuable*

Please note that this effect tier is basically meaningless because there are so many exceptions. The main thing I want you to take away from the tier system is that there are low, and top-tier effects.

On average, and in confetti or nutz, can be acquired for 1 buds or even less! As each slider moves further and further to the right, hats get vastly more expensive per tier. Google is your friend here. Here's what I type in when I want a very specific unusual hat price checked

I get lots of results of people trading and/or selling their Madame Dixies with burning flames

## ***PHASE TWO: Listing your item!***

*****

We will cover what the two types of threads should look like

* Buying, simple buying thread.](http://sourceop.com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=86972) The only thing I could think to criticize would be his profile link, which goes to his /id/xxxxx page, and not his /profiles/###### page, which is much preferred.

A ""rep thread"" is used to list your former transactions and how you are trustworthy not to perform any funny business over Paypal or in game. Creating a rep thread on SourceOP by following the instructions listed there will allow you to keep track of purchases. Always make sure to ask people to leave you feedback when you buy an item! [Here's mine!](http://sourceop.com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=76672&amp;highlight=)

* Selling threads are not too complicated either. Register for SourceOP.com, MannCoTrading, and whatever other sites you find will allow you to list. Your thread should [look like this](http://sourceop.com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=86518).

## ***So someone made you an offer you like! Time to buy or make a sale.***

*****

There are a couple of things you should do before going any further.

1. Set up a Paypal account to be able to send and receive money. Verify it

2. Check your buyer or seller's SteamID on the SteamRep.com database. If they have been discovered as a scammer or otherwise unsavory individual, and if you knowingly deal with a scammer, there is a chance that you will get a scammer tag yourself!

3. Verify that the person who has expressed interest is who they say they are. Ask for a PM from the user's rep thread

4. If you end up using one, and middlemen. Ask for proof via forum PM, if need be.

*****

* Buying an item when you have little to no rep means you will likely need a middleman, and members of invite-only Steam groups, like [UTC Admins](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/utcadmins) are good to use. Some may charge a nominal fee for their services, while most do not ask for anything. Once you and your business partner have agreed upon a middleman, the seller gives the MM the item(s) to hold until you have sent money over Paypal or Moneypak. When sending money over Paypal, make sure to send the money as a ""gift,"" so that it is non-refundable on your end. Unless you have a ton of rep, they will refund it and ask for gift payment. Once the money has been sent and confirmed by the seller, and you're done! However, people have gone to jail for it.

* Selling an item means you don't have to have as much rep
The two most common ways to receive money as a seller are Paypal and Moneypak, especially for transactions under $100. However, if you are unsure about a buyer's reputation (not many forum posts, only a little feedback, etc), request that the buyer (USA only, I think) use a MoneyPak card. Moneypak cards can be ""charged up, by going to a vendor, or others, which can be input on [Moneypak's website](http://moneypak.com) using the ""Add funds to Paypal"" button. Once you have input the code and sent the money from the card to your account (you will receive a confirmation e-mail and money in your account)
It is customary to knock off a portion of the price for the inconvenience of this method, as this is an annoying process for most buyers, and they deserve a pat on the back for giving you not only money, but peace of mind.

1313270926.0,jhyte,Common Trade Scams and How to Avoid Them,cdxliv,100,7,48,"With any economy


**1.The straight up lie. (semi-scam)**


This only works when the victim has no idea of values

You can avoid this simply by asking someone for a price check on tf2trade or in server. People will tell you that such a trade is extremely one sided and you should avoid it. 


**2. The more than 8 trade**


This is when someone offers more than 8 items for whatever you have. For example I promise you 3 v hats 13 weapons and 2 paints for your earbuds. These items won't fit inside a single ingame trade window. However the guy seems quite nice and chatty so You think sure he will give me the rest of the items after i make the first trade. However they will instant delete you after the first trade is done and you never see them again. Valve doesn't care

To avoid this


**3. The Rename Scam**


This was particularly popular during the early days of trading when the trade system was not fully scam conscience. People would rename billycocks into modests (there's a huge difference in value if the hat was unusual). People would rename their weapons to include qualities (vintage

This scam is now obsolete due to the fact that if you hover over an item in a trade window it will clearly indicate that it has been renamed. You can also distinguish between qualities of items by turning on item quality color in your backpack. Purple are unusuals


**4. DO NOT CLICK ON THAT LINK scam.** 


This is a very common phishing technique, it will just jump to some random page that has nothing to do with anything. Now some devious hacker out there has your account information and password. They can buy shit from the store if you have your CC info saved, they will clear out everything in your pack. 

How to avoid this, since that's invitation for some serious ID theft. Having steam guard turned on also helps against this kind of scams. Lastly Do not Rage on that friend who sent you that link, he's not the scammer, he probably did the same thing as you and clicked on a dumb link and scammers got his account too. 


**5. The Impersonator Scam**


There are established traders in each trading community. These people have Reputation of being straight and honest and trustworthy. When dealing with such traders it is common practice to trust them and give them the items first before they send you that paypal cash or that multi trade. These traders will ALWAYS have a public profile, and most importantly 500+hours on their tf2 time at least. Impersonators will copy a trusted traders profile down to the last detail and approach you   saying they are interested in buying something from you. They will claim to have a lot of REP so that you should go first in the trade. You look at the rep thread they gave you and think, wow the dude's legit. So you send him your max head/earbuds/unusual but the paypal cash never comes.

To avoid impersonators, empty backpack and low hours and low friends are other indicators. In the rep thread that they provide you there's usually a link the the real steam profile of the trusted trader, if you click on that and that person is not on your friendslist then you are dealing with an impersonator. 

To avoid impersonators, and check their backpack. Power traders/ trusted sellers will RARELY approach someone for a purchase, these people are connected, why would they add you randomly and offer to buy your stuff? 


**6. Fake Middleman


Some one wants to buy one of your hats for lots of money, you ask them for rep they tell you they don't really have any. So they suggest a middleman, and you think to yourself, if he suggested a middleman that means he's legit and not trying to scam me. So suddently another person with a trusted name and profile joins the steam chat. You have heard this person on all the trade servers ""DB, Hamstar. Trell, Fildy, Blackened, it will be the name of a trusted middleman. He will talk you through the process


This is a 2 person scam, find your OWN MIDDLEMAN on a trade server. These scams usually prey on the greed of the people. If someone offers you 40usd for your earbuds, which are only worth 18, you might think YAY my lucky day, instead you will be down 18. If it's too good to be true, it probably is a scam. Steam Rep check both the buyer/seller and the middleman. 


**7.Swap Scam


Someone approaches you with your dream unusual, your heart skips a beat, you hover over the hat to confirm it is indeed what it is. You are excited and is willing to comply with every demand of the other person. You throw up your 400 dollar unusuals along with 100 dollar worth of promos, the other person will keep on asking for different things, aka throw in a refined, a key, no i don't want that change that to a paint. They will try their best to distract you will you are busy looking for stuff in your backpack. Finally the other person says yes, its now a FLIES KABUTO

Amidst all the haggling and him keeping you busy, and a flies kabuto. While you are eagerly trying to get him to do the trade by complying to his demands, he has switched the goods on you. When he finally says ok, you are too excited to double check and made the mistake of being scammed.

To avoid this scam, you should be extra cautious. If the other person is losing value in a trade with you, you should question why. If there are multiple unusuals of the same hat different effects in their backpack you should be cautious. Check their steamrep profile. 


**8.Fake paypal email scam**


Someone just approached you inquiring about your unusual, you realize that paypal never received 300 dollars. That paypal notification email was fake. 

It was sent from a spoofing account with the name PAYPAL


**9. The backcharge/dispute paypal scam**


In tf2 trading world, if it says payment for goods. You need to refund it and say I only accept personal gift. Sometimes people really forgot to click personal gift, other times they are trying to pull a fast one on your and get your hat then dispute that 800 dollar payment for a virtual good. 

*Buyers from certain regions have no access to Personal Gift option


**COMMON RESOURCES TO COMBAT SCAMMERS**

www.steamrep.com scammers are redflaged. 

www.sourceop.com has a great forum section with a giant sticky for scammers

www.google.com just put in their steamid not profile

www.steamidfinder.com Profile link can be easily changed

1374112188.0,1ij2tk,[PSA] Valve has issued a public statement regarding idling,wickedplayer494,104,14,88,"http://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=11105

&gt;Your time is valuable

&gt;We recently made a change that helps ensure players are playing TF2

&gt;As with any update, and rewarding to as many players as possible. We will continue to examine how the Item Drop System is used, and make any adjustments as needed to benefit the players.

&gt;Questions and Answers:

&gt;What is the definition of “actively playing” Team Fortress 2?

&gt;From an item drop perspective

&gt;Is connected to a VAC secured server.

&gt;Is responding to in-game drop notifications while not utilizing external programs to do so.

&gt;Is running only one instance of the game.

&gt;Is not in textmode.

&gt;A player who meets all of those criteria is earning time towards random item drops (subject to the weekly cap).

&gt;Will I be VAC banned for not actively playing the game

&gt;No

&gt;Will I lose my drops if I'm idling? Will it affect my weekly drop cap?

&gt;No

&gt;Why are you changing how the Item Drop System works?

&gt;This change is designed to make the TF2 experience equally rewarding for all players. The previous system had flaws that allowed players to collect rewards without actively playing TF2.

&gt;I don’t idle. How does this impact me?

&gt;The new system ensures you won’t become disadvantaged for playing TF2 the way you always have.",,t5_2s0s4,False,,default,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/1ij2tk/psa_valve_has_issued_a_public_statement_regarding/

The **FIRST THING** you should do when ANYONE asks you to trade

***
**BEST PRACTICES**

1. Always add moderators through their Steam Flair - the safest way to do this is to click on their name in the sidebar and find a post within the /r/tf2trade subreddit. An alternative way to add moderators is to go to the [Steam Community](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/rugctrade) page and add one of the administrators there.

2. Always check the person you are trading with through Steam Rep using the above procedure

3. Keep copies of Steam IDs of people you are potentially going to trade with

4. ALWAYS check the steam ID of the person offering to middle man

5. Never accept a random middle man. Get one from Steam Rep's trusted middle men or a moderator/admin from here. Add **us** by clicking the link on SteamRep. 

6. Always be cautious of random adds. They may not be who they purport to be.

###PSA and Raffle #2

------------------------------------------------------------

For those who missed the announcement yesterday

You may know me from [an announcement I made](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/ws4ye/psa_come_join_the_community_trade_server_where/) last week about setting up a new trade server

It hasn't been that popular, and have more people join, and hopefully come back regularly?"" 

With the help and valuable input of Heisenberg, which will be taking place this Saturday, with a grand prize for the winner... and his partner. 

""His partner?"" You ask. That's right! 

On **Saturday

---------------------------------

###**The Event**


The rules are simple. 

There will be 14 players on each team. 7 snipers

The map will have a divide in the middle. Snipers cannot cross to the other side of the map

**The Sniper Loadout:**

Primary: The Huntsman  
Secondary: Jarate   
Melee: Kukri  


**The Spy Loadout:**

Primary: Revolver  
Secondary: Invis Watch  
Melee: Knife  


Each sniper will be partnered with a spy (so tell a friend about this event!)

There will be 3 ""pre-final"" rounds. The last sniper standing on both Red and Blu will win a prize (and his/her spy partner too) and will be allowed to enter the semi-final round. They must then sit out for the 2nd ""pre-final"" round while the process repeats

There are two semi-final rounds. 

In the first round, then we must have a Red team winning the second time). 

For the final round

And that's it for the rules!

I will be announcing the grand prizes (one for the Sniper and one for the Spy, the winners will get even more cool stuff! 

#**If you are interested in registering for this tournament

I am now in the midst of exams and a thought came to me in the shower this morning. I realized that I waste far to much of my time trading instead of enjoying TF2 as a game. Please help me fight my addiction



Backpack.tf states my backpack to be worth over $200. I am willing to let it go for around ~~$180US~~ **$140US**



Now you're all probably wondering what is in my BP... Here are a few of the more ""pricey"" items:

* Unusual Flipped Trilby (Steaming)
* Unusual Stout Shako (Bubbling)
* Menpo #30 (craft)
* ~~Freedom Staff #39 (craft)~~
* Vintage Ullapool Caber
* Strange Holy Mackerel (crit/low health/domination parts)
* Strange Mantreads



If you are reading this and it doesn't appeal to you



**[EDIT] I have been convinced by my mates on steam to stay within the community. Because of this I feel obliged to keep a small proportion of my BP. I have worked out that the items I would like to keep cost $37-/+. I am now looking for offers around $140. Sorry for the throw around fellas.**

* **Shark**: Someone who looks for people who dont know their prices in order to buy at a very low price

* **Lowball**: When someone offers a lot lower than what its worth

* **B/O**: Short for ""Buyout""

* **C/O**: Short for ""Current Offer""

* **Quicksell**: When a seller tries to sell something quickly by selling it for much lower than what its worth. 

* **Rep**: Short for reputation, doing things to gain trust makes it go up. 

* **Sweets**: Something small to even out a deal.

* **PC**: Short for ""Price Check"" asking others what they think the price of said item is.

* **Cancer**: A hat or effect not many people like and is therefor very hard to sell.

* **Downgrading**: Often used in unusual trading

* **ScrapBanking**: When someone (the scrapbanker) trades scrap metal for 2 weapons

* **Vanilla**: Original items.

* **Dirty/Clean**: Dirty has something making it bad. In normal hats usually means store bought and therefore uncraftable and is only half as valuable as its clean counterpart. In higher trading could mean gifted or duped. Lower value here as well. Clean means not dirty.

* **Spycrabbing**: A form of gambling where people put up equal wagers (if higher than 8 keys in worth to a middleman), that player is out. The last spy standing wins the pot of wagers. If higher than 25 keys in worth please tip your middleman :)

******
* **STORES**: Tf2mm- Team Fortress 2 Metal Market. TF2WH - Team Fortress 2 Ware House. TF2OP - TF2 Outpost. TF2TP - Team Fortress 2 Trading Post.

******

**CURRENCY**
******

* **Buds**: Short for Earbuds

* **Bills**: Promotional item for L4D

* **Keys**: Orginal purpos is to open crates re purposed for currency. Equals ABOUT 2.55 ref (this is very disputed)

* **Ref**: Short for Refined Metal

* **Rec**: Short for reclaimed metal

* **Scrap**: Equals 2 random weapons

* **Crates**: Unless new

* **Craft Hat**: Hat considered too ugly to wear so is crafted in hopes of making a pretty hat. Equals 1-1.33 ref.

* **Max Head**: That bunny hat. Is about 2.5 buds. Is max's head in sam in max (promo item). Commonly used in high tier unusual trading.

Unfortunately I do not believe this is so, refined metal

Keys being used as currency are part of the problem. What is hard to acquire? Ref, they could simply go into the store and purchase a butt-load of keys, injecting them from nowhere. Metal is created at a constant rate controlled by Valve, and one cannot simply “purchase” metal out of thin air. Promos are even rarer, there is a **VERY** small of them amongst the ever increasing player base. Unusuals, however, are the reason this has all come about. They used to be valued SO high because they were rare and desired. But as more and more keys are bought out of thin air, driving the price down exponentially. Why? The amount of promos is **NOT** increasing

Now
So where does that leave us? The prices are still wildly changing but in my opinion are nowhere near the spreadsheet values. In the past 2 weeks alone, while the buds are not. 

What are things worth? I don’t know, I DO know that 1) Promos are going to be worth **A LOT** more **VERY** soon and 2) Unusuals are worth less promos by the day.

I'll start off by saying that I'm not affiliated with scrap.tf in any way. (For those of you who don't know, keybanking and ticketbanking with 100% automated trade bots.)

The creator of scrap.tf

My keybanking bot is a heavily customized version of SteamBot

I originally wrote this bot for my small Steam community
Now I've decided to release the source code for my keybanking bot so that everybody can learn how it works. I've also coded a scrapbanking bot very similar to scrap.tf's

**You can find the source code on Github's Gist [here](https://gist.github.com/waylaidwanderer/5127827).**

Why am I sharing this
Therefore I've decided that it'd be better if I shared my code - this way you'll get the newest

Let me set this perfectly clear. This is *not* an elitism thing. This is *not* designed to be an exclusive club or anything. This is just a place for people to trade their expensive stuff and be sure that other people on the server are able to buy them.

The server's [GameTracker page is located here](http://www.gametracker.com/server_info/199.96.84.29:27015/)

I'd like to know if you have any feedback.

**Q: What happens if I trade someone on the server and the trade results in my backpack becoming worth less than 75 refined?**
&gt; A: Nothing. The server only checks your backpack value while you connect.

**Q: Can you whitelist my friend whose backpack isn't worth 75 refined?**
&gt; A: Sorry

**Q: What happens if Steam or Backpack.tf goes down?**
&gt; A: If Steam or Backpack.tf goes down

1336960402.0,tlstj,[H] An unusual screenshot system that doesn't require you to give me your hat [W] nothing at all(work on tips),thosepeoples,82,13,93,"**STATUS** Away @ the store

------

Hi guys recently saw the screenshot service on the front page. Not ragging on that guy but there should be *almost* no reason to hand over an unusual.

I take my screenshots by having you join any server and I go spectate and free look follow you as you play the game. 

This accomplishes three things

1. **Your unusual never changes hands. You keep it the entire time!**
2. It makes for some nice ""action"" shots with explosions and such
3. Have your exact loadout included in the screenshots

Some examples of my work [Example 1](http://i.imgur.com/sRSZP.png), [Example 4](http://i.imgur.com/CDXyo.jpg)

And a good [before and after shot of my work](http://i.imgur.com/gnnyH.jpg)

As for payment

On the other hand if you want to throw some metal over my way I will gladly accept it :)

Feel free to add me

**edit** 

Received a comment from Shok

&gt;Ah ok, who insisted that I took screenshots of him while he wore the hat. The biggest problem I found was that it's very hard to coordinate. I had to tell him to stand somewhere, but I couldn't actually point to where I wanted him to stand, I had to instead tell him to move left, or right and when to taunt etc. The other big problem was, that in a public server, we didn't have sv_cheats on, on that public server, I can use sv_cheats and therefore, its hard to take good screenshots if you wear the hats. it's easier to take good screenshots if i'm wearing the hats.

He brings up some good points. It gets rid of some of the problems of screenshotting but I still operate on the fact that there are other ways to go around those problems. 

Please don't downvote or discourage Shok he has great screenies and is just doing things his way. I put this trade up here to supply another service for the people that don't feel right trading their unusuals.

------

**edit2**

&gt;In ~2 weeks time we will be **requiring** you to have flair to submit trades and comment on the subreddit. We have some new back-end tools at our disposal that will make moderating easier for us. Flair being required also means no posts from people who don't leave their SteamID and don't have flair.

&gt;**How do I update my flair?**

**Rules and Introduction**

It's me

Every 2 weeks or so I will post a flair request thread. I'll start taking requests for 24 hours. Then I'll brew some tea and toast some crumpets and I'll go on a massive flair spree for an hour or two

Also because I'm making this a semi-regular thing now I wanna make some rules (not scary rules).

+ **You must only ask for a flair if you have the intention of donating
+ Please check the hat has not already been made by going to the [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/121jz7/introducing_donator_flair/)
+ Please give me any info I might need; *Style
+ 1 request per person
+ No down voting others. All requests will be seen and fulfilled.
+ I aim to please

If you don't have [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com) I highly suggest you get it. It gives you a little hand button to show [what the flairs will look like](http://i.imgur.com/hMdvj.png).

I think it's a brilliant idea

So here's the plan. You make a request below then I will try to make it for you. I'm fairly new to this

All I want in return is for you to donate to the server. That's it!

I will add to the current weeks list with ones to be made. They will either be in progress or queued up to be made.

1352339312.0,12u08b,[PSA] Backpack.tf Prices,Komodo135,89,18,43,"==== **NOT MY WORK

This is a pretty long rant and there is a tl;dr

So Backpack.tf used to be a very helpful site where you could get an accurate interpretation on the prices of items. People in the community could vote on the price of an item and when a bunch of people agreed with it and had proof of there claim then the moderators would change the price of the desired item. This all seems like an awesome idea because you can vote on what you want and if you get say 160 people agreeing with you and 10 that don't


Recently thought well browsing certain items or browsing different websites I have found more and more proof that this so called ""great website"" is in fact becoming corrupt. I'll just start with some straight up facts


I am not saying that the admins are changing the prices for there benefit or that That these prices are wrong


Price's that have a big positive majority vote and are denied
So the following are just a few incredibly bad decisions made by the moderators of backpack.tf


**Lumbricous Lid**
http://backpack.tf/vote/id/5096229fba25363d0c000000 The following link shows a trade that someone suggested. He started a vote to change the item from 6 ref to about 2-3 keys (5.33- 8 ref) Now around 238 people agreed with him and 79 people disagreed which is 75% agree. apparently though since no admins thought to close or accept the offer it was naturally declined.
http://backpack.tf/vote/id/507c4ce049d7b83071000002 194 votes for 23 votes against but Chancellor Puddinghead closed to trade because of some reason.


**Earbuds**
http://backpack.tf/vote/id/508d8107ba2536e10f000002 wanted to lower the price by 1 key because thats what people were buying them for. 207 for
*Kringle Colellection*
http://backpack.tf/vote/id/5089c77c49d7b8280f000002 all he wanted was to change the value by about .5 keys


**Festive Medi gun**
http://backpack.tf/vote/id/50772ead49d7b80006000000. 219 votes for


**B.M.O.C**
http://backpack.tf/vote/id/5066dbf349d7b8923d000001 240 for
http://backpack.tf/vote/id/5074d8b149d7b82f7e000000 230 for the price
The list goes on forever but I really don't want to find all of them. obviously if the public are agreeing on something and there's a score of 100+ and they have proof then it should be changed to that price
Price's that have a huge negative vote and are accepted
These are literally worse than another trade. For some reason admins at backpack.tf seem to want to change prices of certain items even though majority of the community doesn't


**Buds**
http://backpack.tf/vote/id/507bc5f149d7b83b3b000001 So this is just wrong. The Oatmeal wanted to change the price of an item by raising it's price from 27-28 keys to 28 keys. She had no evidence just 1 link that said that they have changed. Didn't show anyone buying or selling at that price. She had 45 votes for her and 201 votes against. That's a score of -155. Apparently though an admin liked this and though that he should change the price anyways.
http://backpack.tf/vote/id/508f26e5ba2536a601000014 Again a score of -15 with 236 for and 252 against. But the creator of the website thought he should change the price anyways


**Kringle Colellection**
http://backpack.tf/vote/id/505cb2de9ae21ad704000000 . This person had no proof what so ever just the sentence ""Nobody is selling under 6 keys"" .9 votes for the price
There are more that are in the negatives but I haven't had the time to look at even close to a 1% of the items. There are at least 40 that I saw that had a score of 1-8 and are accepted. It just shows that these moderators are obviously wanting to control the economy on there own.
I don't know if anyone else agrees with me but I thought I should just share these facts. The moderators are either changing the price of an item when majority of voters don't. or they are not changing the price of an item when voters want the price to be changed.
This is really sketchy Stuff because http://bazaar.tf/ is based on these prices and multitudes of people go by backpack.tf prices. I for one used to go by backpack.tf prices but now that I have found loads of instances where the mods are using there ""powers"" against the majority of voters.
I would really like some input on this so please don't down vote and browse away.



**tl;dr**
Backpack.tf is supposed to be a place where you can vote on what you think should be the value of an item. If a big majority of voters agree with you and you have some solid evidence that people are either buying or selling at that price then an admin can approve the price and update the price on there website.
The mods though have been using there power against the community which includes: Changing an items price when a big majority of people don't want it changed or not changing an item's pice when a big majority of people want it changed.
Scores (positive minus negative) that include: 159 , 172 , 209 , 191 and 172 and declined the right to change there price and scores that include: -155 , -15 and -49 are accepted into changing there price when it should be the other way around.

There will be a raffle/giveaway every day this week up to and including Friday! Yesterday's raffle winner is now announced, and today's raffle is for a Villain's Veil!",waylaidwanderer,76,119

------------------------------------------------------------

###PSA and Raffle #3

------------------------------------------------------------

For those who missed the announcement yesterday

You may know me from [an announcement I made](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/ws4ye/psa_come_join_the_community_trade_server_where/) last week about setting up a new trade server

It hasn't been that popular, and have more people join, and hopefully come back regularly?"" 

With the help and valuable input of Heisenberg, which will be taking place this Saturday, with a grand prize for the winner... and his partner. 

""His partner?"" You ask. That's right! 

On **Saturday

---------------------------------

###**The Event**


The rules are simple. 

There will be 14 players on each team. 7 snipers

The map will have a divide in the middle. Snipers cannot cross to the other side of the map

**The Sniper Loadout:**

Primary: The Huntsman  
Secondary: Jarate   
Melee: Kukri  


**The Spy Loadout:**

Primary: Revolver  
Secondary: Invis Watch  
Melee: Knife  


Each sniper will be partnered with a spy (so tell a friend about this event!)

There will be 3 ""pre-final"" rounds. The last sniper standing on both Red and Blu will win a prize (and his/her spy partner too) and will be allowed to enter the semi-final round. They must then sit out for the 2nd ""pre-final"" round while the process repeats

There are two semi-final rounds. 

In the first round, then we must have a Red team winning the second time). 

For the final round

And that's it for the rules!

I will be announcing the grand prizes (one for the Sniper and one for the Spy, the winners will get even more cool stuff!

1354667606.0,14ak0p,[PSA] How to trade your TF2 (or any Steam-tradable) inventory for currency over Paypal/Moneypak!,musical_hog,71,9,33,"In this guide

I will assume you know how to find a buyer/seller and list your items. That information should be obvious

**Full disclosure: selling items for cash over Paypal is never 100% safe. Chargebacks can and do happen

*****

***Step One: Rep rep rep!***

When selling or buying an item over Paypal

**[SteamRep](http://steamrep.com)** is your *best friend* when determining whether someone is reputable or not. SteamRep is a scam report database

* [Here is what a community admin's profile will look like.](http://steamrep.com/profiles/76561197975564454)

* [Here is what a scammer's profile will look like.](http://steamrep.com/profiles/76561198039183046)

* [Here is what a person with no special tag will look like.](http://steamrep.com/profiles/76561197964482358)

*Special note:* You should Google the other trader's SteamID64

**Reputation threads** are used to keep track of purchases/sales made over Paypal/Moneypak

* [SourceOP.com](http://forums.sourceop.com/forum/) is the birthplace of modern Steam trading. For reasons unknown to me, [such as mine!](http://sourceop.com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=76672&amp;highlight=)

* [Dota2Traders.com](http://dota2traders.com) is a site created by some users of /r/dota2trade (my brainchild) and others who wanted to set up a home base of their own. It is now officially affiliated with SteamRep

When examining someone's rep thread

1. How old is the thread? If it's brand new

2. How many +reps does this person have? If only just a few

3. Is the person you're talking to *really* the person in the rep thread? Double check by asking them to PM you from that forum account with a secret phrase! I've been impersonated about a dozen times by people who link to my rep thread with a spoof account on Steam. Be careful!

If the person's rep checks out with you

**In the event someone doesn't have a rep thread

* Profile rep means nothing. It can be deleted by the owner of the Steam profile

* If the profile is extremely new with *few* games and/or friends

* If the account is old (think *at least* one year old) and the owner has many hours (think hundreds or thousands of hours) of game play, a rep thread is best!

*****

***Step Two: Finding a middleman***

The use of a middleman when dealing with Paypal/Moneypak transactions is *imperative*. It significantly reduces the risk for both parties, but it is considered polite to tip the middleman if it's a large or time-consuming transaction.

* Some /r/tf2trade and all /r/dota2trade moderators can and do perform middleman services on a regular basis. [Message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTF2Trade) here or [over at r/dota2trade](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDota2Trade) if you need someone! I have middlemanned for well over $10000 in goods over two years.

* [SteamRep middlemen](http://steamrep.com/list/M) are community admins who volunteer their time

* [Dota2Traders](http://dota2traders.com/pages/middleman/) has a list of middlemen. I recommend Leon!

If you can't find one, and there's nothing anyone can do about it at that point.

*****

***Step Three: Completing the transaction!***

Once you have found a middleman and all parties are online

1. Group chat is opened with all parties involved.

2. Check everyone's profiles to make sure that there are no impersonators or fake middlemen.

3. Seller then sends the items to the middleman. [Beware the middleman injection scam!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/13072o/psa_trading_reminders_be_careful/) Check the person you're trading with before accepting.

4. Buyer then sends a gift payment over Paypal to the seller. Gifts aren't protection against a chargeback, but it's good form to complete anyway.

5. Seller confirms that the cash has arrived as expected. If there is a dispute about the amount, the middleman holds the items until a resolution has been reached.

6. Middleman then sends the items to the buyer.

7. Exchange +rep on rep threads and/or profiles and/or reddit threads.

8. Tips are optional :)

It is at this point that you may all part ways with the transaction complete.

Please read on for how to complete a Moneypak transaction!

*****

***Step 3.1: Using Moneypak instead of Paypal***

[Green Dot Moneypak](http://moneypak.com) is a service that allows buyers in the USA to put an amount of money (usually up to $500) onto a pre-paid card. This card has a code on the back, they can buy items using Moneypak with no risk to the seller.

If the seller is not located in the USA, USA resident) to redeem the code and send the cash from his account. I have personally done this for many transactions from $200-1000 and more.

*Note:* it is polite to accept a smaller amount to compensate the buyer for the extra effort of this process.

Follow these steps to complete a Moneypak transfer:

1. Buyer charges a Moneypak card at a retailer such as Walmart, with the desired amount. 

2. Upon returning home

3. Seller sends the middleman the item(s). Again

4. Buyer then sends the seller the Moneypak code from the card. If the seller is non-US

5. If the middleman redeemed the code

6. Seller confirms that the cash has arrived as expected.

7. Middleman sends the buyer the item(s).

8. Rep is exchanged

9. Again

1329082577.0,pmhup,[PSA] How to check if an item is duped,nkohari,74,13,28,"I've seen quite a bit of confusion about how to determine if a given item is duped (and who it was duped by)

Every item in TF2 has two numeric identifiers: a *current id* and an *original id*. When an item is traded, so you can see who has owned it.

A duplicated item is one that shares the same *original id* with another item

To determine if an item is duped, replacing ID with the current id:

http://tf2items.com/item/ID

If this doesn't work

Scan the item history on the right hand side to see the previous current ids for the item. If you see the message ""This item potentially still exists""

Remember, it relies on the Steam item servers being functional, which as we all know is not always the case. :) Second, it can't see backpacks of users who have set their profile (or backpack) to private.

Since most of the people who duped items were smart enough to set their backpacks to private before duping, note that if you see the ""this item may still exist"" message, but the person's backpack is set to private, it's possible that the item was just traded. Again, since TF2Items can't see into private backpacks, it can't figure out whether the item is still in there or if it was traded.

Now, there have been a rash of account hijacks over the past few months, and the items that have been stolen have been duplicated by Valve customer support to restore them back to the original owners. In this case, the *original owners* (the victims, not the hijackers) will be shown in the item history with the ""this item still potentially exists"" message -- so don't accuse them of duping.

So, to my knowledge, Valve deleted all of the duplicate items that had not been traded, so it's very unlikely that you'll find anyone in this situation.

Now

**MYTH: Items can still be duped**

While no one knows for certain, but it does not appear to be happening en masse.)*

**MYTH: Items in invalid backpack positions were duped**

This has *absolutely nothing* to do with duping. Most people have items in invalid or overlapping positions. It just means the items were acquired via Steam Trade and the user hasn't started TF2 yet

**MYTH: Anyone with a duplicated item is suspect**

Since the items have been in the system for a long time

**MYTH: Item history with the same owner twice in a row means the item is duped**

You can have the same owner twice in an item's history list for many valid reasons, and moving the item to and from a private alt account. (The last one *may* be a little shady, but it doesn't mean it's duped.)

Hopefully this clears things up a bit. If anyone has anything to add

1326302043.0,ocjn7,A guide to unusual value,,78,13,39,"**I originally posted this in r/tf2

Hello there! This guide is meant to educate people on how unusuals are generally priced. There's a lot of different variables involved

**Class**

Which class is the unusual for? Some classes are played more than others

Soldier&gt;Scout/Demo/Medic&gt;Pyro/Engineer/Sniper/Spy&gt;Heavy

Note how the classes used in competitive play are more expensive than the other classes. Multiclass or allclass unusuals are worth a lot more.

**Effect**

What effect does the unusual have? This is probably the most important part of the pricing. Better effects (burning flames, logo etc).

Unusual effect tier list (submitted by ubermuppy and edited by me). Descending value from top to bottom and left to right.

God tier - burning, cloudy moon

High - scorching, purple energy, green energy

Mid - orbiting fire, smoking, steaming, cauldron bubbles, vivid plasma, searing plasma

Low - planets, logo, peace, purple/green confetti, flies,

**The actual hat**

Do people perceive the actual hat as being good? This is a subject of opinion, an unusual Tyrant's Helm will be worth more than an Exquisite Rack, because people think that the Tyrant's looks better.

Cancerous hats - brain bucket, beanie, coupe, hard counter, Capotain, elfin deal, steely boot, engie cap, geisha boy etc...

**Misc**

Is it a miscellaneous item? Unusuals that go in the misc slot can be worn with unusuals that go in the head slot

* Bonk Boy
* Large Luchadore
* Brainiac Hairpiece
* Blighted Beak
* Villain's Veil
* Le Party Phantom
* Noh Mercy

**Theme**

Does the unusual have a theme? If the hat and the effect create some kind of reference to something, for the love of God, don't tag an obscure theme onto an unusual for the sake of trying to increase the value a bit. It probably won't work.

Examples of themed hats - any fire effect on pyro, blizzard festive tree.

**How to search for your OWN price checks**

Type in on google - site:www.sourceop.com ""Burning"" ""Team Captain""

Use www.tf2outpost.com for a search function

Use www.tf2tp.com for a search

Current offers are what you're looking for

Use your own intuition

Price intelligently. Undercut the market for profit

Promos are king

1357851589.0,16c35e,[PSA] Price Checking Unusuals and Backpack.tf (Long Post),-Josh,64,5,18,"*""How do I price check an unusual?""*

It's not an uncommon question.

*""Try backpack.tf!""*

It's not an uncommon answer.

Backpack.tf has quickly replaced spreadsheet as the de facto method of pricing items. it provides an amazingly high quality service

But with all that it does right

There are a couple of things that I would like you to take away from this

1. Don't use backpack.tf to price check your unusual.
2. Backpack.tf *reports* prices - it **does not set them**.

This second one is important. If people set their prices according to backpack.tf the market will never move. Backpack.tf becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

In their defence backpack.tf have a statement at the top that people really should pay attention to:

&gt; Prices listed are suggested values only. Price may not always be accurate or updated. Should you not agree on a price

Unusual prices move slower and they move in a completely different manner to other pries

*""So how do I price check my unusual then

I will answer that question in depth on another day. Not today though.

So I would like to present to you my rather lengthy explanation of why backpack.tf doesn't work for Unusuals.

---
Backpack.tf and Unusual Pricing: Why it's not a good source.
---


Backpack.tf is a fantastic and valuable service that quickly reacts to market change on most items

This is one of it's strengths when it comes to pricing most items. Items can't just be suggested to be a value

But when it comes to Unusuals

---
1: Unusuals are complicated
---

Unusuals don't usually go for keys or metal. Or even buds. Or other promos. Most of the time an Unusual is traded for other Unusuals. This somewhat undermines the ability to price check something. You can start tiering things

If I trade, you only get a certain amount of the picture. You know that to 2 people, this seemed like a good trade. But we don't know whether the Crown and Phantom that were traded were of equal or unequal value. 

Also

Sweets also muddy the waters. It's not like pure keys

When someone got 'sweets' on outpost and they accept

---
2: Manipulation.
---

So let's temporarily ignore the above problem and concentrate on a more worrying problem. Price setters.

I have a lovely Scorching Beret. But oh wait! Someone wants to buy it! What's the price I'm asking for? Oh just 7 buds. Not a problem they say! Well

[Proof!!](http://i.imgur.com/WmcIT.png) - (there are at least 3 major errors in this photoshopped version of a trade

A Scorching Beret does not go for 7 buds. No matter how much I would like it to.

I am the only person currently selling a scorching beret (as far as I know). There is another one on outpost

So

""With most of these hats off the market and a high tier effect

*""Preposterous!""* - some guy who disagrees.  
*""Outrageous!""* - a different person who is quite vehement about this.  
*""Backpack.tf would never accept proof with only 1 or 2 data points.""* - someone who likes statistics.  

Well, what do i know? I've only owned 4 Unusual Crowns.

With a small organised group it would be very easy to change the price of a couple of unusuals and make a good profit. Generally only ~30-50 people vote on an Unusual's price. It can (and sometimes does) get veto'ed


---
3: Data Points &amp; Quicksells
---

I briefly addressed this

Also garbage data can easily get easily included.

If 5 people see their absolute most incredible perfect I-will-never-sell-this Unusual Hat within a month of each other and all of them

If this information got submitted to backpack.tf we could see a price change be put into effect that would have serious repercussions for other owners. People price check with backpack.tf and get not the standard price

&gt; Backpack.tf *reports* prices - it **does not set them**.

But people don't act like that. We like the idea of things have a set price. It's understandable. But it is also  wrong when it comes to Unusuals. (See section 5 for more on this from a different angle).

---
4. Voters &amp; Knowledge
---

When you vote on a price check

This usually means one of the following:

1. You have owned and sold the item very recently.
2. You have bought the item recently after checking out various offerings.
3. You haven't owned the item

We cannot check this. I cannot prove that anyone else that votes on the items has any degree of knowledge. You could all be dogs for all I know

This is less possible with unusuals. There are fewer of them being sold. Several orders of magnitude smaller. At any one time there are only ever [8 Cloudy Moon Crowns](http://stats.tf/item/342/Prince_Tavish%27s_Crown) being sold. At most. What's the likelyhood of all 40 people all voting on the price change of a Cloudy Moon Crown actually knowing what it's like to sell one? Know the offers that were given and received

When people price check unusuals with me (which happens a lot nowadays) I have to sometimes say ""I have no idea."" Because I've never been involved in any way with that hat - never even seen one sold. In fact

Off the top of your head, whatever you just said is quite probably out of date and incorrect. This is what it's like having people who don't own or know a hat. Sometimes yes, we can make an informed decision. But a lot of the time, it makes no sense for someone who hasn't owned or tried to own a hat price checking the hat. 

---
5: Art vs Commodity
---

Unusuals also have one more facet

With most items

But with unusuals this is not always the case. Instead of competing to sell

Let us say that you are a circling hearts collector. Your collection is almost complete. All you need now is a Circling Hearts [Crones Dome](http://stats.tf/item/920/The_Crone%27s_Dome). You have 6 buds and you think that's a fair price. You find the seller and the seller asks for 25 buds.

You cannot go elsewhere. That item is 1 of 1. Perhaps another will be unboxed

This is an extreme case, not at what the buyer sets it at.

This is somewhat moderated buy other sellers and generally sellers end up pricing their unusuals at similar prices - but when a whole load of them are taken off the market then the price is set buy the seller

1350228410.0,11go4f,[PSA] Flux's guide to trading and etiquette. From weapons to unusual hats.,josman3,69,7,36,"Hello TF2 Trade!

I am relatively new to this community, however it seems to be rather dated. This site seems to have few recent guides on such matters and I guess I could lend a hand. I am not sure at what level to aim this at, as I have no idea of the experience of most of the traders here, however based on my experience on trade servers and outpost, I'd say that starting from the basics isn't a terrible idea. If this guide takes off, I'll be sure to update it and improve it when I have the time. Feel free to PM me advice or leave a comment about any mistakes/changes I should make.

*About me:*

I used to trade regularly a couple of years ago,](http://backpack.tf/id/76561198000068960) without resorting to sharking, scamming or similar dirty tricks. Just a bit of know-how, experience and luck. 

*****

**Miscellaneous things:**

It is helpful to make friends with trustable and more experienced traders for advice and perhaps in a quick loan for a great deal. To make trustable friends you need to be trustable yourself. Don't scam

*****

**Some 'tools' of the trade**

*Trading Sites:*

[Outpost or OP](http://www.tf2outpost.com/) is one of the more used sites at the moment

The [Outpost Script by Vaicine](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/10orw4/psa_tf2outpost_toolbox_script_12_released/) is an exceptionally helpful augmentation to outpost. Allows you to search and view trades more efficiently

[SourceOP or SOP](http://forums.sourceop.com/forum/) is a place I don't use very much

[Trading Post or TF2TP](http://tf2tp.com/index.php) is still rather active

[Bazaar](http://bazaar.tf/) is fairly active, with little room for profit, and I rarely get any offers on the site.

*Spreadsheets:*

The bane of many of the pre-steam-trade-traders. They have cut down much of the scamming that was rather rampant

[backpack.tf](http://backpack.tf/pricelist)
I find that this is a thorough spreadsheet, as it often represents a true market value.

[TF2 Spreadsheet](http://tf2spreadsheet.blogspot.com.au/)
This is the default spreadsheet for most people

*Trade Servers:*

There are a whole bunch of trade servers which are
""trade"" or ""trading"" or something like that into the search by bar in the server browser. Similarly unusual trading servers can be found by typing ""unusual"". Often these are based in Europe/America. 

*****

**A rough conversion of items:**
Promos/keys/metal are also known as ""pure currency"" and are often much more accepted than other items.
A brief list of conversions here; (if this is too basic just tell me and I'll remove it)

2 weapons = 1 scrap = 0.11... ref

3 scrap = 1 rec = 0.33... ref

3 rec = 1 ref 

2.55...-2.666 ref = 1 key

8-10 keys = 1 bills hat

26-28 Keys = 1 earbuds

2 earbuds = max head

9-10 earbuds = houwar which is the highest regular promotional item

Promos are items gained usually from pre-ordering a game or some other type of *promotion*. These include, max's severed head, h.o.u.w.a.r, holiday headcase, b.m.o.c, big kill, etc. These are usually items that predate ""genuine"" items

*****

**Regular Trading**

*Buying items:*

It is important to understand a sellers' psychology, so I would be the only seller, and I had the lowest price on the market. With people who specify their prices and *say they are firm* (with the exception of unusual traders) will most likely not take it kindly to you adding them on steam and offering on their items. If you are to offer on a trade, if you are paying pure currency, feel free to ask for a little bit less, so there is a profit margin for you. If you do it in the right manner, more often than not, since a reasonable guy with a reasonable price is a good person to trade with. I find that you can get **much better deals in game especially if you are paying with pure currency

*Selling items for a profit:*

**Note that this is more of an explanation of maximum profit

When selling an item you need to understand buyer's psychology and some basic statistics (OH NO THE HORROR!). They want to do either three things with the item. **Use it, or 25%, 5% and 70%. When I say they want to use the item, I mean usually they want to wear it. Thus they are willing to pay full price (FP) or a little bit more (FP + 1 arbitrary unit). The arbitrary unit (AU) can be anything; a rec, a scrap, a weapon, a key and is tied to the value of the item. It is basically your profit margin for most items. It is often easier to find these buyers on a trading site. Occasionally they will be willing to pay slightly higher than full price, apart from wear it. This includes, renaming hats and so on. These people often realise that by doing so, with a standard deviation of 1 AU. I found it optimal to focus on buying items at the price of FP - 1 ~ FP - 2. Thus at the highest range of your buying

[Here's a **graphical explanation** for what I am saying.](http://gyazo.com/b9fff49ae968ff448569d0a7f71cfa93) This graph represents roughly the market for items. I am suggesting that you buy at FP - 1 and Sell at FP for **maximal consistent profit**, basically the **crux of my entire guide**](http://gyazo.com/5e2c3806c5474ed1e44082bd3f4de935), not only this is profitable, it is very **stable** and **consistent** and **safe** profits (with the notable exception of new items, which don't have a fixed FP, see my later section on ""new items"").

***TLDR;*** *Buy highly demanded items for slightly under the market price

*Cutting your losses:*

Often you will find yourself with too many items to sell, the more you profit you make. Thus it is often better to quickly sell some items in order to increase your total currency value (even at a loss of your theoretical currency value) as having currency allows you to make more profit than just trying to sell those damn 10 strange scatterguns you bought before the price crash for FP - 1. You should try and sell at FP - 2, or at a bulk discount, **as long as the recent profits you have made cover the losses incurred by the deal**. This ensures a smooth flow of items in and out of your inventory, allowing for maximum profit. 
*****
**Trading Strategies**:

Feel free to comment or message me with more suggestions here for this section.

*Scrapbanking:*

This is a very grass roots leveled trading method based on the simple premise, you can sell a single weapon for a scrap (or 2 weapons) from the right buyer, who would like that item. Make sure that the weapons given are craftable, and it often helps to put the word scrapbanker in your steam name.

*Stranges:*

As stranges are often hard to sell, this often isn't a very fast way to make profit, so you will have to be patient. The exception to this is of course the high range; salvaged, festive, botkiller stranges, which fluctuate in price greatly.

*Craft Hats:*

A craft hat is any hat that is craftable. This encompasses almost every hat/misc apart from the Ghastly Gibus/Alien swarm parasite and the halloween costumes.
It is reasonably easy to buy a craft hat for 1-1.33.. refined and either craft them together for the hopes of a nice hat, which can be a few scrap profit. Nicer craft hats can go upwards of 2 ref. Buying these for a little under the market price and then selling for the market or just above can be a stable method of making profit. When selling, you should always consider offers in other items, as long as they are reasonably easy to sell and or more valuable. 

I traded a lot of craft hats near the start for good profit. The trick is to find a few hats that people really like. For me I found the Troublemaker's Tosslecap and the El Jefe are highly demanded hats. Even still with the tossle's tf2spreadsheet price at 2-2.66, for example, it was easy to buy a tossle with pink paint at 3.33 ref, and sell for 4.33. Craft items (apart from scrapbanking) is the safest way to make a reasonable profit, with prices fluctuating slowly and very slightly. 

*New items:*

These are high risk, and are experienced and can afford to lose big time. This is basically when new items are released, and the true market price drops below what the spreadsheets say, so it is possible to get things for lower prices. A good example of this is the recent botkiller weapons. (Note this advice only applies for items that are relatively easy to get

*Marketing your hats/items for sale:*

This part deals with specifically how to sell hats on a trading site/server. On a trading site, regardless of their level/paint/etc** (exception is low/cool craft number). I cannot stress this point enough. Just put a reasonable price, and more often than not people will take it. Add a link to your steam profile or a steam add link for convenience.

Another important thing to note for trading is *don't flood the market*. If you have purchased multiples of a certain item (with the obvious exception being promos), but it seems to be the psychology of many of the buyers. If you have a lot of a certain item; especially stranges, strange parts, keys (not so much at the moment, with the high demand for keys), selling them at a bulk discount will help move these hard to sell items, (and in the case of keys, is not losing

*Etiquette:*

Thanks to BDS_USH for some more tips. 
&gt; 1. For the love of everything, C) you are willing to give them some kind of massive overpay. It's annoying and embarrassing to be added by someone who is trying to lowball you or offer up something that is nowhere near the value you asked. No, ""ten refined worth of items"" is not the same as ten refined, just as ""ten dollars worth of groceries"" is not the same thing as a ten dollar bill.
2. Please don't be ""that guy"" who never updates their trade. If you are selling a number of items on Reddit/TF2OP/etc, people will think you're trying to run a bait and switch.
3. Similarly, there's no reason to rush into selling things to people without checking who they are first. Would you do that in real life?


*****

**Unusual Trading**

Will be expanded on later

Tiers:

A hat's value is based on three factors:

* Tier of the hat

Nicer hats, however a low tier effect may still not be wanted. Soldier/Scout/Medic and perhaps Demo are the more desirable higher classes, as they are often most used and prominent.

* Tier of the effect

Nicer effect-&gt;more value, stormy storm) have been decreasing in value significantly, due to a relative increase in unbox rate. Generally the older effects are valued higher, such as; sunbeams, scorching, burning, energies, hearts

* The Effect fitting the hat

Otherwise known as ""themed"", ghosts on spy, or even a blizzard toque, which is winter themed. Certain themed hats can be worth significantly more than the combination of the hat / effect tiers. A rule of thumb of ""themes""; if it isn't obviously themed, it often isn't themed. Unless someone explains the theme and makes you go ""Oh wow! Why didn't I think of that?"", then most likely it isn't themed.

Unusual Prices:

Your best bet in determining an unusual's price is to search for it on a trading site, unusual prices can vary depending how many are being sold at once. If there is only one being sold, the seller can be quite liberal with his pricing. Of course nobody would pay for it if it was hugely overpriced, but he would probably still get more compared to if there were 5+ of the same hat on the market. Prices are all determined by supply and demand. High demand can increase a hats value, as well as low supply (very few being sold). And the inverse is also true, low demand can decrease a hats value, as well as high supply.

**RGBacon has asked me to put a warning here about making sure you check prices thoroughly

[backpack.tf](http://backpack.tf/unusuals)

This is a pretty reasonable site for unusual prices. It is usually accurate enough to prevent you from being hugely ripped off. However, and low tier hats are slightly overpriced, however that may just be the slow economy.

[tf2 price check](http://www.tf2pricecheck.net/Forum-The-Unusual-Bible)

This is often very accurate as long as the latest post is dated recently.

*Unusual Strategy:*

Set yourself a target. Have a ""dream"" hat you want to reach. This is very helpful as it gives you a direction and focus in your trading. It allows you to break down a potential target which may seem impossible into smaller checkpoints. Be patient when selling an unusual hat and try not to rush into a deal without reliable advice

*How to start unusual trading:*

to be added

*Unboxing a hat:*

It is worth noting that unusuals have an **equal** chance of being unboxed from a crate (unless stated differently by Valve), and perhaps from crates released before those new effects, i.e. crate 25 and lower, according to experienced unusual unboxers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/167wjm/psa_the_effect_of_an_unusual_does_depend_on_the/)

*****

***Unusual Marketing and Selling Strategies:***

Your preference when selling an unusual is almost always pure promos. Put a list of Current offers or C/o on your trade, but will try and find a middle ground, which is the true price you want.

However people expect to pay less for a hat (unless they want a hat to use) as they want a profit of this. This can most blatantly be seen by the hundreds of pages of people buying quicksells on outpost alone. Secondary to that is a mixed offer of promos and unusuals

How you determine what value in unusuals to sell for is pretty simple. Take your realistic promo price, (and aren't hard to sell hats) you should take it. Be realistic with your prices. Don't say ""this is my dream hat so you will pay twice as much as it is worth"". If you don't want to sell it, don't advertise it to be sold. Simple.

To work out how easy a hat is to sale

Selling as a set is a good idea, sell those things for promos/keys and put them in the trade, saying you have ""x earbuds, keys"" for upgrades.

I never wanted to do this,000 GB of bandwith (Thanks Bacon and Team Railgun!). However, in a few hours [we will be exceeding 2,000 GB of bandwith](http://puu.sh/7a1T). Our trade servers use approximately 100 GB of bandwidth a day. Each GB over our limit, we get charged 10 cents. So each day we will have to pay roughly 10 dollars a day.

**WHY**

The reason why this is happening is two fold: 1) we have a very active server and 2) we were DDOSed earlier in the month that chewed up a ton of data.

We are left with few options:

1. Get $60-70 to take care of data overage fees until end of the month

2. Shut down one of the trade servers and cut the player slots to 8 -  12 until the next cycle starts

3. Wait until we hit the max for this billing cycle and then shut down both servers until the next cycle starts.

1361429673.0,18xx8j,[PSA] Be wary of prices on the Tux (and probably most untradable promos),beardedpancakes,69,11,73,"Now

**What's happening?** People are trying to inflate the price of this ~~shitty~~ penguin.

**But

***Here's what I've noticed*** Users offering way above current offers in the form of 7 keys+ while they:

a) Have cheap backpacks (albeit not a serious red flag)

b) Don't have enough keys

c) Are selling the Tux or own one themselves

**Okay, lets consider the deal with the Holiday Headcase about a year ago. If you remember, one user was telling owners of the HH to raise their B/O and (correct me if I'm wrong) posted fake C/Os on other users trades in an attempt to inflate the price and it worked for a while. In fact, I think the price might still reflect the fake prices now.


**So a lot of talk/speculation. Where's the proof?**

1) http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/8686758 - offered 5 keys

2) http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/8711812/ - epitome of scum. Hijacks other users threads. S. Ullapool looks legit. 6 keys is not. Also has the 6 keys guy running around posting on his friends' trades to top their C/Os.

3) http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/8775275/ Had to say something here. 

4) http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/8695508 Offered a painted bills by someone who owns one. Also

5) http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/8688842 Offered 8 keys by someone who owns a Tux

6) http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/8713526 Offered 20 keys....you guessed it


I'm collecting more

**TL;DR** Traders are trying to inflate the price of their own items (go figure) by creating fake C/Os on other trades.  

 --------------------

**Adding something else that may be a good discussion

""Well this is actually completely unique in the sense of promotional items.

Buds were never untradable so as soon as one received them they could sell for whatever they wanted.

The tux is (i believe and please correct me if I'm wrong) the first initially untradable promo that is **not** genuine. The question is

Take this for example: Bill's Hats, Lumbricious Lid, Portal 2 promos (despite some being genuine) are all completely uncraftable, which has made the the first 3 (well, somewhat with the EA) into what we generally refer to as ""promos.""

So **tl;dr** the price of the Tux is up in the air depending on whether or not it will be craftable. So the normal advice of trade as soon as it's tradable may not apply.

So I guess the real question is

The topic of the day today is sharking.

What is sharking?

Sharking is understood as paying lower than the true value of an item because the person who owns the item doesn't know the true value of what he or she owns.

Sharking is known as sharking because ""sharks"" hunt these unaware traders so they can take advantage of their lack of knowledge to score rare items cheaply.

What makes sharking bad?

At the moment it is generally understood that sharks are evil monsters who get off to the deals that they score and that they have no morals or pity. Potential socio/psychopaths welcome. (Also known as the Witcher 2 for Burning Ballcap).

Why is this the case?

Has anyone ever rationalized that the people who are trading these hats for these terrible offers are in full command of their motor functions at all times? Has anyone ever considered that the owner of the Burning Fruit Shoot who traded it for Railworks: Train Simulator maybe wanted Railworks: Train Simulator and asked for it? We enforce these ridiculous value structures on these virtual items for what purpose? Maybe a game is worth more than an unusual hat to some people. Who are we to say that they got “sharked.”

The thing that bites me about sharks though, is it my responsibility to tell him that he could get one hundred copies of Railworks: Train Simulator for his hat? (based on current value structures).

To put into a real life context,750 dollars more than I need to.

To get back into trading, I’m sick of all the cash sales. The trading economy is falling apart and we have only ourselves to blame. Real scammers take advantage of the fact that we use rep to facilitate cash trading, hence impersonators. If everyone could just chill the fuck out and trade for what they want, values aside, it would be simpler for everyone.

God knows sharking already jumped the shark.

Misrepresentation Scams: If someone represents something one way and it turns out not to be that way, the buyer must reasonably inquire to find out what they are purchasing. If they do not, then it is not scamming if they did not get what they thought they were getting for failure to ask.

1. Bill says his hat is worth 4 refined. It is worth 2. Jim does not research the hat

2. Bill says his hat is craftable. The trade window does show whether or not a hat is craftable. There is no way to determine whether a hat is craftable or not other than the seller's word. Jim buys the hat and then finds out it is

First of all, no matter how pretty that other guys hat is, do a pricecheck on it. You could be losing out on a lot of money, sometimes hundreds of dollars. 

One other major tip: don't let the other trader pressure you. Don't listen to them if they tell you your hat is 'crap', overvaluing their own items and being deceptive. 

Last week I lost about $50 because the person went through my profile in order to determine stuff I liked to talk me into giving him my hat for less

***
*Notes:*

* Buds are roughly $25-28

* If your hat can only be found in $$$ then divide it by 26~ to get the value in straight buds. (Multiply by ~26 to get the value in $$$ etc.)

* 0.5 buds is roughly a Bill's hat + 1-2 keys

* Before trading

F.A.Q. 
---------
* When do I receive my match? 

You will be messaged on reddit by /u/Steambot sometime between a few minutes from now and tomorrow. Steambot will send you your match's SteamID and reddit account for you to add them/stalk them with. 


------------
* I'm not sure if I was signed up correctly. How can I check? 

Go to http://www.reddit.com/message/messages/ and look for a message from /u/SteamBot that says the following:

&gt;You've been successfully entered into the /r/TF2trade Secret Santa event! You will be sent your match on December 7th. Questions/problems? Message /u/Cheesydude on reddit. 

If you do not have this message in your inbox

-----------
* How do I send my gift to my giftee? Do I just trade them? 

There's a bunch of different ways to gift your giftee their gift! 

1. You can add them on steam through your main steam account and simply trade them their gift. 

1. You can make a new steam account and name it ""x's Secret Santa"" and trade that account your items you want to gift, so you'll have to ask your giftee in a reddit PM (use an alt here too!) to add that specific account. 

1. You can gift wrap the item and send it to them if you're both on the same server - no need to add them

1. You can add them on steam and gift them a game with a message included if you want to gift steam games to them. 

1. There's loads of ways to do it

Please note



----------------

* How do I find out what to gift my Giftee? 

1. Try doing a search for their reddit username in /r/TF2fashionadvice

1. Make sure you check their TF2 gameplay stats to find out if they play a main class (e.g. http://steamcommunity.com/id/IMACTUALLYACRATE/stats/TF2 obviously *loves* spy). Get them something for their favourite class! 

1. If you can't find anything on their reddit account or steam profile

1. You could also check their Steam wishlist (e.g http://steamcommunity.com/id/IMACTUALLYACRATE/wishlist) to see if they want any games if you are gifting them games. 


--------------------------------------

* It's Decemeber 28th and I haven't heard anything from my Secret Santa

We will have a database of all the gifts sent &amp; received


------------------

* What are the consequences of someone being a Bad Santa and taking gifts but not giving them? 

Gaming the system or intentionally receiving and not giving is considered an act of dishonesty that will result in the offender being marked a REDDIT SCAMMER by SteamRep. I don't want to have to do this to anyone

1354723387.0,14bs3q,"[PSA] Grey's Guide to Max Heads: Levels 1 &amp; 7, the Duped and the Gifted",-Josh,69,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/14bs3q/psa_greys_guide_to_max_heads_levels_1_7_the_duped/, regardless of level.

---
**Duping
---

When an item is 'duped' it has been replicated using an exploit/glitch to make more than one version of an item. The second version retains the 'Original ID' of the item and is identical in every other way. Theoretically speaking duping an item reduces its value because it changes the amount of supply in the supply/demand curve. 

With the Max's Severed Head

It is also 'known' that the level 1 and level 7 versions of the Max Head were the most duped and have secured themselves an infamous history

This

What is less commonly known is that all the Max's Severed Heads had their histories wiped by Valve, seemingly worth less than the usual Max Head. 

So

Let's look at some statistics.

---
**Statistics**
---

According to stats.tf and backpack.tf we find the following:

Max's Severed Head currently sells for ~2 buds

* In 3, 8,479 copies of this item exist, just 0.28% of all items.
* 9 are of the Vintage quality.
* 24 are of the Self-Made quality.
* 31 are not crafteable.
* 78 have gift text &amp; 1 is inside a carefully wrapped gift.

If we then look at the [statistics page of the Max Head](http://stats.tf/item/162/Max%27s_Severed_Head) we can break down how many of each level exist and find out just how badly duped the Max's Severed Heads was during its duping heyday and the results are rather surprising.

The average (mean) quantity of a Max heads at any given level is  84. So unsurprisingly when we look at the quantity of level 3

* Level 3 - 76 exist
* Level 4 - 83 exist
* Level 5 - 87 exist 

All fine and dandy

---
**Level 1: The Easiest Level**
---

Now let us look at the level 1 Max Heads and 

* Level 1 - 1208 exist

There are 14 as many level 1 Max Heads than average. This item at this level was duped so many times that it makes up 14% of all Max Heads

For me

In fact, the average quantity of a Max Head at any given level drops from 84 down to 73.

---
**The Shadow Effect**
---

So

* Level 7 - 68 exist.

No, that the marketplace is full of sheep. By the time that the histories had been reset, it was too late for the level 7 Max Heads. Its history had been tarnished. 

When we look at a chart of quantity of Max Heads at every level


*Apologies with the graph for not labeling each and every bar with its level

So, stay that way.

The reduced price of a level 7 Max Head is completely unnecessary and now unfounded. A below average quantity exist and the price should be considered to be the same as any other level (excluding level 1). Unfortunately

The only thing we can do is propagate this knowledge. Share the stats.tf page freely and invite people to look it up for themselves. When you advertise that you're buying Max Heads

---
**Other duped levels of Max Heads**
---

*So

Of course they exist. It's just that the duping wasn't as prolific. But a duped Max Head matters far less than a duped unusual. Why? Again

There are usually between 10 and 40 of a given hat/effect combination. The effect of duping an unusual hat is significant upon its price. However it is *not* significant on the price of a Max Head (unless you do it to the point where the market is saturated with a single level).

I value duped Max Heads at the same price as unduped. In my experience

---
**So what about about gifted Max heads?**
---

This is a different kettle of giraffes altogether. Gifting is the use of the gift wrap item (available in the store) to give an item to someone else. Gifting an item permanently emblazons your name on that item (unless the item is regifted).

The reason for gifted items having a lower value is that the gift text can never be removed. It will, this isn't a problem for most people. But when the gifter's name means nothing to you, it is naught but an annoyance. Rightly, the value of the item is now decreased, like an art piece that has had an owner squiggle his/her name on the back. It might not be visible to anyone else, but it is still tainted.

Further to this

I'm sorry those who were hoping for better news - gifted is worth less for good reasons.

[Max Heads level 1 should be worth less

The Reddit Unofficial Trading Network is open to **all** reddit trading communities that want to pool and share resources. Here is how this effects you:

* One massive community for events and charity drives.

* Unified and simplified rules across communities. You know what will be expected of you no matter where you go - no surprise rules. (This will take some time to implement.)

* Cross linking subreddits. Each participating subreddit (soon) will have links that cross link to other participating subreddits. 



* Unified reporting and appeal system. Check out the [cross community reporting/appeal system here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bans). Eventually this will be the only way to report/appeal for /r/tf2trade.

* There will be a shared ban list across each community that participates. This way we can put a real bite into a subreddit ban. Further

* In the works is a full service website that will aggregate all open trades in one easy to read place.

So far, or Dota2, but ANY trade community), please pass along this thread and/or contact me to discuss joining this network.

What could be one solution is using data from a website such as tf2outpost (easier than TF2trade since everything's in a kind of standard format), and what people are selling for (ideally, that is).

1373204928.0,1hsv49,[PSA] A Brief Overview of TF2 Trading: Hopefully the first of many,Rhys13th,64,10,37,"How economics take place in TF2: An overview

_________________________________________________________
So, to study the in game TF2 Economy and now likely the burgeoning DoTA 2 economy as well. Well, this is intended to be sort of a crash course, not only on how to make money within the trading that’s developed, but also the history of said economies, and what exactly makes them tick.

***Introduction***

So, (In order of value) Metal, Keys, Bill’s, Buds, and HOUWARs. The last one, HOUWARS, and are rare enough that they will not really come up unless in god tier Unusual trades.
Metal is a currency tied to one main thing: time. It used to be tied to the time that people spent playing the game, it is just that: speculation. The reason that metal and hats are important is crafting. Metal, along with the weapons needed to make it, can be used to create either weapons or hats. Hats, as generic value, are accepted at 1 ref and 3 scrap, a seemingly arbitrary number. However, you’ll notice one titled “Build Headgear”. It costs either 3 ref, else people would have no reason to buy the other. As it so happens, or the 1.33 people are so used to paying for a ‘craft’ hat.

***Keys***

Keys are an altogether trickier proposition. They are not, which is to say  currency because everyone agrees it is one, but rather are only made when someone buys one in the Mann Co store. This means that at the most, a key is worth $2.50, the amount needed to make a new one. The general equilibrium that settled pre- Beta market/Halloween was that 5 ref was roughly 2 keys, heading upwards to 2.66 ref. With the convergence of 3 things, Keys began to rise in value relative to metal. What 3 things? The first was Base64’s discovery of carders injecting vast amounts of keys illegally into the TF2economy by purchasing stolen credit cards, using those keys to trade for Earbuds, and then sell said bud for a large loss? Valve caught on soon after Base64’s PSA, many more were being consumed

***Bill’s***

Bill’s Hats are a good example of a fiat currency. No, which is currently 7.5-8 keys. Why is it an effective currency? Well, there’s a limited amount since more cannot be created, people like the hat, and it’s been around for a while. Well, why not just make a Genuine hat into the next currency, you might ask? People did try that, for the Genuine Archimedes. But people can be ornery

***Earbuds.***

 One of the most popular hats, it’s been around for a while (since before trading was there in TF2) and they were the first hat/misc to have an effect, no matter the visibility. Currently, they fluctuate between 22 and 25 keys (Current price as of 7/7/2013 is 23 keys), or a range in between there. Not much to say here, so if you have anything to add, drop it in the comments and I’ll throw it up here.

***HOUWARs.***

Much like keys, simply put, they’re too many of em. And they’re too unstable. As of this time (and correct me if I’m wrong) they’re worth 11 buds.
Now, Holiday Headcase, other random hat) a currency?” Well, the reason is relatively simple. A currency needs to be accepted by a large number of people (bye bye Archimedes) have a relatively stable price (See ya, Headcase), and be tradeable in some fashion (toodles, Tux. At least, “they’re metal mongering heart breakers! 2.66 ref! 2.66 ref!” Well, and remain constant relative to Bill’s and Buds. That 10 cent increase is barely enough to account for inflation of the USD since then
Now, you care because TF2’s like the Foreign Exchange when it comes to its items. You don’t really have a set value on a currency, and so you’re not really gaining or losing money as much as swapping one kind for another. Why is that important? Well, metal is weak relative to keys, and keys are strong relative to Buds. Therefore, you can buy Buds for metal, and swap for keys, of course

***Trading Sites***

Outpost, Scrap.tf, Backpack.tf, /r/tf2trade, and other assorted trading means. What’s the best way to use them? The fact remains, that (apart from backpack.tf’s pricing suggestions) they serve one basic purpose, which is to connect buyers and sellers. Outpost is, a go to place to either post up high value goods such as Unusuals and rare Stranges, I’m not saying you’ll score craft hats for 1 ref each or anything like that, but enough that you can use it to fill out loadouts quicker and cheaper than posting Buying trades. Backpack.tf

***Effective Sales***

Now, Outpost, and backpack.tf. This subreddit has a limit on how often you can post, and Outpost has restrictions on how often you can bump your trade as well as rules against posting the same item for sale twice. In general, you want to use the following division:

* Outpost

* /r/tf2trade, ranged between 1.33 ref and 5-6 keys. Something that needs more time to sell, and the requisite interested parties to have some cash at hand.

* Trade servers for low end stuff worth around .11 to 1.33, you aint gonna stick out at all. Trade servers you really have the chance to haggle.

* Scrapbank.me and Scrap.tf for banking services, just save you a bit of time on a hat you don't want.

Wasn't just the kid whose world got all twisted. Guess that's what happens when people are left stranded on a rock in the sky. Cleaning up's been a long time in the comin'. Found some strange stuff lying around.  

* Team Spirit Bills Hat - 9 keys

Old Bill was a war hero. Ain't much left to remember him by. Guess the calamity didn't care much for bravery.

**SOLD**


* ~~Fancy Dress Uniform - 1 key

Fancy tie belonged to a general. Kinda thing that would make a man straighten up with pride. No shame in looking good.

* ~~Salvaged Crate #40 - 12 keys~~

Kid found box marked valuable

* ~~Buccaneer's Biccorne - 2 ref (x2)~~

Kid's never been one for the ocean. With a feather that fine

* ~~Cremator's Conscience - 2 ref~~

Pair of dolls come as a set. One an angel

* ~~Bonedolier - 2 ref

Kid find's an old momento from a man who thought he was a shaman. Didn't do him much good when the calamity came. 

* ~~Crone's Dome - 2 keys

Never seen a hat smile before. 

* ~~Vintage Tyrolean - 1 ref

A fine old hat with a feather in its brim. Kid don't like it too much but he's never been much of a healer. Probably a good thing not to get attached to what you're selling.

* ~~Strange Mantreads - 4 keys~~

Some boots for an old soldier. Heavy enough to trample someone. Still got a bit of that polished shine. Bit o' work and they'll be just like new. 

* ~~Strange Widowmaker - 7 keys~~

Strange gun takes any sort of metal for ammo. Heaven for a tinkerer with spare parts. Kid ain't got much patience with machines. Probably better off in someone else's hands anyway.

[UPDATE] 1.1

First new version since I released this. It's just got a few fixes as requested:

 - Lower browser resolutions are now fixed
 - The notes show up everywhere that they should!

I'll be adding the new features into a bigger release later on.

You can download the new version from: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/148791

Hi guys

So this is a follow on from this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/10b946/q_what_greasemonkey_scripts_do_you_use_to_make/

A fair amount of interest was shown in the script

So without further ado

http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/148791

The text from userscripts.org:

This is an all in 1 script for TF2Outpost improvements. Features include the following:

- Saved searches. Add an option to the main navigation where you can save and load searches. 
- Hide trades. You can hide trades from ever showing up again! 
- Toggle dontators. Show and hide dontators (Undecided whether this should persist across search pages) 
- Toggle by keyword. Enter a keyword and it'll filter all the trades with that keyword. (thinking of adding an option to allow the user to choose whether it's a positive or negative keyword) 
- Show the notes on the right of the trade (and hide the adverts) 
- Auto refresh when you hit a 503 page 
- (forgot about this one) if a search listing shows no trades (because you've hidden them all!) then it'll automatically move onto the next page!

Features to be implemented (ideas from you guys!)

- Highlight trades you've already put an offer on. 
- Allow the user to load all trades on one page
- Adding prices from the tf2 spreadsheet to items - like bazaar.tf. This would get the data once a week or so and store it locally on the browser.
- Adding a WYSIWYG editor for when you make a new trade.
- Toggle trades to only show trades by users that are online

If you like this script

If you feel like donating anything

Also please rate the script!

If you have any ideas for features to add to the script please let me know!

Got into trading a few days ago. It was a lot of fun. But I've been having arguments at home and finally decided to fuckall.

Trading away everything I have for free.

PS - I'm grounded right now and can only do so much from my phone. Be a little patient. I'll trade as soon as I come online.

I'll need a giftwrap to send the marauder.

If anybody feels like donating a weapon to add here, if I get any keys. Forgive me if greed overpowers me in case I uncrate an unusual. Other than that, enjoy!!

**Rules and Introduction**

It's me

Every 2 weeks or so I will post a flair request thread. I'll start taking requests for 24 hours. Then I'll brew some tea and toast some crumpets and I'll go on a massive flair spree for an hour or two

Also because I'm making this a semi-regular thing now I wanna make some rules (not scary rules).

+ **You must only ask for a flair if you have the intention of donating
+ Please check the hat has not already been made by going to the [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/121jz7/introducing_donator_flair/)
+ Please give me any info I might need; *Style
+ 1 request per person
+ No down voting others. All requests will be seen and fulfilled.
+ I aim to please

If you don't have [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com) I highly suggest you get it. It gives you a little hand button to show [what the flairs will look like](http://i.imgur.com/hMdvj.png). 

If you don't have it yet

If you've been around in the last few weeks or so

To find out more go [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/121jz7/introducing_donator_flair/)

I think it's a brilliant idea

So here's the plan. You make a request below then I will try to make it for you. I'm fairly new to this

All I want in return is for you to donate to the server. That's it!

I will add to the current weeks list with ones to be made. They will either be in progress or queued up to be made.

1346394607.0,z4gqb,[PSA] Java exploit being used to target TF2 traders.,CanadaRox,56,6,30,"A major bug found in Java 7 is being used to target TF2 traders in an attempt to hijack their Steam accounts.  (More information about one specific hacker can be found [here](http://www.l4dnation.com/general-discussion/about-the-hackings/) or [plain text mirror](http://pastie.org/private/1kvaqj5w2wxyqpktxqv10q)).  The specific URL in this case was meant to appear to be a *.jpg on imgur.  The actual URL being `http://imgur.&lt;snip&gt;.com/analcookie.jpg`.  (Domain removed for security)

The simplest solution to avoid the exploit currently is to uninstall Java 7.  The exploit doesn't work on older versions of Java so if you have Java 6 or older only you are safe from this specific exploit (others may exist so you may want to look into if you need Java

Everyone should always be careful when clicking any links on Steam but until this Java bug is fixed make sure you are extra careful!

(The user in the above incident is already marked on SteamRep by his PayPal email but if any /r/tf2trade moderator would like all of the information I have I will gladly forward it to them.  I have also contacted the related providers for all associated IPs I have available)

**Edit: Oracle has released a patched Java 7 that may fix the exploit but you may want to check fully into the current status of the patch before you update.

**The Trading Subreddit**

Currently, out of the roughly 1.5 million page views, 93,503 of those visitors are unique - meaning people who do not just bash F5. 

Since our subreddit has grown so much

Another thing that we will be implementing shortly to help those unfamiliar with reddit is altering the ""hot""

I'd also like to update everyone on AutoModerator. Our initial reason for bringing in the Automoderator was to take things out of the spam queue quicker. I am proud to report that AutoModerator is actively working better than expected and approves over 100 posts a day

***

**The Chat Room**

Recently rules were rolled out and enforced in the chat room. The enforcement of those rules drove the regular users away from the chat room. The rules, being respectful, and a limitation on trolling other members. 

After reviewing these rules, in this case, occurred once they were enforced. As soon as the rules were posted the moderation team took swift action in enforcing them and several chat bans were issued. Going forward, all moderators will be enforcing the *spirit* of the rules and not the letter. This means you can say anything you want to your friend, except for racial/homophobic/ethnic/etc slurs and not worry about being banned. However, you may not troll, harass, etc


 I reviewed the facts and circumstances surrounding the chat bans and, will stay for a period ending one week from their time of the ban.

In determining which will be unbanned immediately, for those that continued harassing or condescending comments toward the moderator staff or disrupted the chat room *after* their banning will not be immediately unbanned. However, once the ban period ends, everyone will start with a clean slate.

As an aside, or insulting moderators or administrators in our community will not be tolerated what so ever. If it ever comes down to permitting a person or group of people to belittle, harass, or insult a moderator for the sake of having a chat room, I rather not have a chat room. No person deserves to be belittled, harassed, or insulted for the sake of their *voluntary* job in an *internet* community.

That aside

Chat bans will be appealable **directly** to me. I will have the final word whether or a not a chat ban was justified. Moderators are required to screen shot/log each ban and the reason for the ban. Failure of a moderator to do that will result in an immediate unban - regardless of reason except for marked scammers.

**Trade Servers**

As some of you know, have two very active trader servers. Please feel free to donate and receive donor perks. If you donate, be sure to include your Steam ID so you may receive those perks on our server. You may donate via paypal or with keys.

Overall, so will our staff. Therefore you may see a few more friendly faces about willing to help.

1366408819.0,1cpbkm,[PSA] The Max's Severed Head and its Value Versus Stats,Pilltacular,58,7,41,"So we all know that the level 1 and 7 Max's Severed Heads are all duped and sell for much less

Wrong. 


First of all
Scroll through the level list and look at the level 7 Max. Only 78 exist. That's less than many

Now you're probably wondering

Answer: They're not. 

The level 1 and 7 thing was a rumor started by traders that all Max Heads of the aforementioned levels were duped, thus beginning the Max Head stigma.

One of the biggest reasons there are so many level 1 Max Heads is not that they were duped. It's that a little over halfway through the promotion, the promotion was, without notice, extended by a week, so those who bought the game after the initial promotion still could receive a Max Head, which had a 1/100 chance of being level 1. There are currently a little over 8000 non-level 1 Unique Max Heads and slightly under 1500 level 1 Unique Max Heads. That gives a nice idea of the time span of the event and when the level 1s were turned into level x's.

Now, letting people track the dupes. [Here is an example](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/10051878) of a non-duped level 1 Max. [Here](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/10039875) is an example of somebody being confused about whether their hat is a dupe or not (it's not). [Here](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/7211122) is a duped one. A hat with an identical original ID (1189008198) resides [here](http://www.tf2outpost.com/backpack/13288). [Here](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/9275833) is a Max head with a one-owner history, because of the history wipe. You can also see ""❤skaPANeas❤"" claiming it to be duped.

Last but not least, the level 1 and 7 Max's are devalued simply because people believe them to be worth less. Buyers dictate the market, because they are the ones that give the final say in what is paid for an item. These buyers all believe that level 1 and 7 Max's are not worth 2 buds, and will not pay that. This creates an impasse between firm 2-bud sellers and under-2-bud buyers, which the buyers will win. Thus, the level 1 and 7 Maxes are brought down in price, and the repetition of this action by many traders drives the stigma further. The entire reason the level 1 and 7 Max's are worth less is simply because of the value people believe it to be worth

That's about it. I may tack stuff on later

1362461173.0,19ovub,[PSA] 500 Crate Unboxing 2: Unbox Harder [x-post /r/tf2],aryst0krat,64,12,73,"###What is this?###

Back in September I went absolutely crazy and **bought 500 keys** just so I could **open 500 crates** and **livestream the whole thing**. Then

This was an incredibly stupid idea, but was rather put off the idea of having to deal with that again.

Shortly afterwards, but turn the rest into metal. Then, using that metal, **craft hats and give them away** instead! Still a lot of work, but much less so than before. Plus, people get hats instead of largely worthless strange weapons. Win-win! And if they feel it's added value (a piece of history or something) they can even leave the 'crafted by aryst0krat' tag on them.

Also, but I raffled one off anyway because I didn't particularly want it. There is a very good chance this will happen again, but I won't make any promises other than that 1 of 5 will be given away for sure.

One other thing I did (poorly) was **donate to Childsplay** for every 100 viewers that were in the stream. I peaked around 300, surprisingly! I guess more people were interested in the crates! :P

Unfortunately, and depending on my finances I will probably either up the donation or the milestones at which I donate. I would love it if you could donate, too. :)

###So

Well

Last time, a lot of these crates were fairly worthless. Not that their actual worth bothers me, but for the people receiving the items it would be nice to get something useful/expensive.

So I'm going to ask for your generosity in this field again, if you have some to give away, I'm going to post a comment that you can reply to so that the thread at large isn't clogged up. From there I'll decide which ones I'll take and open.

If I don't get any/enough donations (which, I'll just have to get crates the slow, expensive way. Not really a big deal.

The second roadblock is **keys**. No, a gift of one is sort of like trying to raise the sea level with an eyedropper. Besides, the whole point of this is that I'm crazy and I spend way too much money on nonsense.

No, it could be as soon as two weeks from now that I'm ready to go, key-wise. Or, it could be a few months.

So if you know **anyone who is selling keys for a good price in bulk** (preferably I'd buy them all at once, as far as I am concerned. I bought most of mine at $1.25 last time, but unfortunately that seller was cashing out and I don't think he even plays TF2 anymore. Bulk means... well, unless the price is ridiculously good I can't imagine buying less than 50 at once. I'd appreciate if I could get a bulk discount or something, but I understand that this is asking a lot of the seller. :)

**Canadian sellers are preferred

The other roadblock is **my internet connection**. I work 10 of every 14 days, **I am only able to trade/chat for very small periods of time** (I have to see my friends and family while I'm at home, too!).

All that said, and will probably go for about... 4 hours, I think? I can't remember exactly how long the last one was.

I said alright and he said to use TeamViewer so he could see me playing. Then he tells me that he wants to pay me before doing the shoot for helping him out. Then he wants me to put up my unusual so the people on YouTube can see it. He then uses TeamViewer to accept the trade for both me and him and then trades the unusual over to him.

1348961117.0,10orw4,[PSA] TF2Outpost Toolbox script 1.2 released!,vaicine,58,7,51,"Hi everyone

As you may or may not have seen

For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about

 - Saved searches. Adds an option to the main navigation where you can save and load searches!
 - Hide trades. You can hide trades from ever showing up again!
 - Toggle dontators. Show and hide dontators
 - Toggle by keyword. Enter a keyword and it'll filter all the trades with that keyword.
 - Show the notes on the right of the trade list (and hide the adverts)
 - Auto refresh when you hit a 503 page
 - If a search listing shows no trades (because you've hidden them all!) then it'll automatically move onto the next page

Since I released the script last week

Today I'm happy to release the first big update to the script. The following features have been added:

 - Lots of UI Improvements
 - The toggle to hide all donators will now persist across pages (so now you only click it once)
 - I've changed how quickly the script refreshes the page when TF2Outpost returns a 503 error. Now it's once every 3 seconds.
 - Added a button to delete individual saved searches
 - The script will now check for a new version when you first open the TF2Outpost website
 - Added negative and positive keyword toggles (so you can now show by keyword as well as hide by keyword)
 - Added toggle by item level
 - Added toggle by craft number
 - Added toggle by unusual effect
 - Added a button to show/hide more info on the trade listings page
 - Added a 'toolbox' menu item which will include settings and things like that
 - Show how many trades have been hidden in the toolbox menu
 - Added a 'clear all hidden trades' button to the toolbox menu (careful with this one!)
 - Added a 'clear last 10 hidden trades' button to toolbox menu
 - Added a 'clear first 10 hidden trades' button to toolbox menu
 - Added a block user button to trades page
 - If the toggle doesn't match any trades
 - Fixed a bug with cancelling on the keyword toggle

With this script

http://i.imgur.com/81mTW.png

There is one new feature that needs a bit more explaining - 'The script will now check for a new version when you first open the TF2Outpost website'. This works by checking a server run by me to see what the current version of the script is, so I don't want to alienate those people.

After the first release of the script

With all that in mind

They are not worth 16 keys. Selling 16 keys @ 1.25 would give you enough to buy the _entire victory pack_. Buying the crest for 16 keys _is an even worse deal than the Mann Co store_.

Do not be scammed by a seller who is banking on you not knowing about that schema change.

EDIT: As pointed out below

EDIT2: I now see the schema has a new attribute called 'can_craft_if_purchased'. So I would guess that it uses the last 'state' of the item (purchased, etc) to determine whether it's craftable, and as such, ones marked 'traded' would not be converted.  It also seems possible that trading this 'clean' item to someone might cause it to turn dirty when it enters their backpack?

EDIT3: The 'origin' flag on the crest is not what impacts the dirty-to-clean toggle, and those who purchase them end up with clean crests.

EDIT4: I traded my clean crest to a friend, so it is not tied to the purchase history of the current owner. When I viewed the badge on backpack.tf, my 'original id' matches the current id, even after the trade, which _may_ be the reason it's clean? Checking the crests of those who have uncraftables shows that the original id no longer matches the current item id. What causes this to happen?",,False,t5_2s0s4,True

For those who missed the announcement yesterday, I am also announcing the competitors in this tournament - congratulations for all who got in, and for those who didn't, don't worry! Feel free to come by and watch on Saturday! I will be enabling SourceTV on my server, so feel free to come and spectate, everybody.

You may know me from [an announcement I made](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/ws4ye/psa_come_join_the_community_trade_server_where/) last week about setting up a new trade server

It hasn't been that popular, and have more people join, and hopefully come back regularly?"" 

With the help and valuable input of Heisenberg, which will be taking place this Saturday, with a grand prize for the winner... and his partner. 

""His partner?"" You ask. That's right! 

On **Saturday

---------------------------------

###**The Event**


The rules are simple. 

There will be 14 players on each team. 7 snipers

The map will have a divide in the middle. Snipers cannot cross to the other side of the map

**The Sniper Loadout:**

Primary: The Huntsman  
Secondary: Jarate   
Melee: Kukri  


**The Spy Loadout:**

Primary: Revolver  
Secondary: Invis Watch  
Melee: Knife  


Each sniper will be partnered with a spy (so tell a friend about this event!)

There will be 3 ""pre-final"" rounds. The last sniper standing on both Red and Blu will win a prize (and his/her spy partner too) and will be allowed to enter the semi-final round. They must then sit out for the 2nd ""pre-final"" round while the process repeats

There are two semi-final rounds. 

In the first round, then we must have a Red team winning the second time). 

For the final round

And that's it for the rules!

-------------------------------------------------

###THE GRAND PRIZES ARE: For the champion Sniper

As stated before, be they weapons, miscs or hats, please do so! They will go into the prize pool! Also, as a for-profit trader, it'll make me feel better after giving away so many prizes... haha.**

--------------------------------

""No matter how many keys people buy from the store

And since this is obviously detrimental to Valve since idlers basically buy keys for free (weekly drops) and sell for money (one less sale at the Mann Co store)

**EDIT:** _Re-reading my post, I still think metal inflation is a concern, and is ultimately detrimental to the mannconomy and tf2. First, it creates a barrier to entry that may deter people from entering the market and second, it gives those hoarding goods more power to influence the market._ **/EDIT**

**Supply &amp; Demand**

_Demand_

Right now Valve is approaching the problem by making keys indispensable. Do you want a festive/strange/unusual? No matter how much metal you have, how does Valve deal with the surplus of metal and subsequent devaluation of keys?

_Supply_

One approach is to attack the supply right at the root of things: crack down on idling and persons with multiple accounts. Hopefully Valve doesn't take this route because, it doesn't work and usually does more harm than good.

_Supply

Another approach is to target the the supply once it's in the system. Right now, or games through steam -- right? And none of those things affect the supply of metal (metal is not removed from the mannconomy, but only switches hands). So, in order to increase demand for metal, there needs to be some sort of mechanism to remove it from the economy. 

_Solutions?_

Crafting, you can't just change the craft random headgear recipe to 2 ref - that wouldn't solve the problem, only decrease the value of the loser hats people use strictly for crafting. 

You also then, is making them only available through crafting (or purchase through the Mann Co store, of course). What if they took it a another step and made it so some items were only available if crafted with metal? What if there was a recipe to craft crates? At this point I'm just brainstorming, but I'd like to hear your thoughts.

**tl;dr** To sum things up, Valve's bottom line. New updates are only a short-term solution to creating interest in buying keys from the Mann Co store, and targeting idlers/multiple accounts is not feasible. How then can the metal problem be fixed? I believe changing incentives in the crafting system to encourage the crafting of metal is the most tenable solution.

1373244492.0,1hu0b3,"[Q] Got banned from Outpost, which lead to the ban from MCT trade servers, some people treat me as scammer now. What would you do in my situation?",Crabislav,55,49, put some time into. Thanks in advance.

Well

Been trading on tf2outpost since september 2011 iirc, when a guy I wanted to buy an unusual from, who was permabanned from tf2op for faking current offers on his items, asked me to help him to look for offers on one of his unusuals. Being unaware of the rules and generally dumb, I agreed to help him. Moreover, I donated 7 keys to tf2op few days ago. Which again proves the point that I would not knowingly break the rules if I knew it would lead to the permanent ban. 
http://www.tf2outpost.com/user/26592 this is my outpost profile. You can find the trade where I was ""brokering"" his hat (I never had it in my bp though) and the guy I was trying to help from the ban reason. Both of us are Russians, found the line regarding brokering for banned users and closed trade immediately. Turned out someone already reported me since samhudson333 sent me a PM saying that I'd be banned if I didn't close the trade instantly. He told me that he understood that ""it was a matter of ignorance and was quickly corrected as soon as you read the rules"". He basically let me free. However, the next day I checked tf2op to find myself permabanned. I made an appeal on the site and samhudson333 was on my side (he was chatting with me on the ban appeal page) but later the appeal was denied by another mod. 

So, he rejected all my appeals saying ""You still broke the rules"". I can't deny it was my own fault that I didn't read the rules after having a long break from trading of course. It was just quite sad to realise that I couldn't be given a second chance. Oh, and yeah, I lost 7 keys I donated of course but I couldn't care less about them.

Here's what recently happened at MCT unusual trade server. I've been trading on MCT since fall 2011 and everything was fine. A couple of months ago, which he considered fake of course). Later on, I realised that he was just envious, his backpack was way cheaper than mine and he never had an unusual worth even 4 times less than mine. You know, he was like ""hahahahaha ur so dumb, ur hat is 30 buds"" and stuff like that, his grammar and behavior were telling that he's no older than 15 basically. Then he found my profile on outpost and started spamming the chat calling me a scammer because I'm banned from tf2op. Some guys started defending me telling that ban from outpost doesn't make me a scammer yet and that it's pretty easy to get banned from there. Kid just refused to listen and calmed down. Couple of minutes later, he started making fun of me

So, chat transcripts in case if you want more detailed info on the past events. Thanks for reading and I'm looking forward to hearing form you. Cheers.

1372651270.0,1hemnm,[PSA] Sharing ways I make money,mirkky,63,16,33,"I am working on cashing out so I figured I would share a couple of the simple ways I have learned to make money using the Steam Marketplace.  You may already know to do these

**Low Priced Genuine Hats:**

When genuines get to around $0.43 or less you can make a profit buying them off the market.  It takes 4.25 craft hats to make a key (5.66 ref) so that means you are spending at a maximum $1.83 per key in steam wallet.  Right now selling a key on the market gets the seller $1.93 so that is $0.10 profit for you with minimal work.  When you start building the amount of wallet you have you are able to have a large volume flowing through your pipeline bring in money to you.  Often times you will also find hats under $0.43 each thus bringing the price you pay per key lower.

**Watch genuine Prices when Updates come out:**

The last two updates that came out have made the steam market very wacky in regards to genuine prices.  I expect this to happen again with the TF2 summer update and with the summer sale.  People realize they  have genuine items from purchasing some game and want to dump them for quick money to buy robo keys

**Higher priced Genuines**

When genuines are more normal in their price you are usually able to net at least $0.61 an genuine.  I like to buy keys and then sell for metal to then buy genuines.  Fairly easily you can find genuines for 1.33 ref each and it is also pretty easy to leave a trade open on outpost buying for 1.11 or 1.22 and get a lot of people selling them to you.  With a key at 5.66 currently that means you would be getting 4.25 genuines per key.  A key costs $2.21 on the market at this time and selling 4.25 genuines for $0.61 each means you are selling a key for $2.59 each.  Some genuines sell for a little less and some sell for more

**Get priority at trading websites**

I know some people don't like Outpost or scrap.tf

If you have any questions of other things I have done ask me questions.  I know I don't have a multiple thousand dollar backpack like some people, Steam, Uplay, and Battle.net were through trading.  I have done small cash outs in the past through Paypal, but this one is my largest and it more than covers ever penny I spent with real world money.

[Key Thread 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/15lwlo/h_22_keys_w_233_ref_each_one_per_person/)

Some people are confused as to why I do this. I admit, to be honest, I don't really care. It's not about profit to me, it's about being fair. In my opinion, 2.33 is--and always has been--the fair and reasonable price for Mann. Co. Keys. I remember back when I used to save up and craft every weapon I received from drops, and how long it would take to craft 3 refined (which would, back then, and a lot more places to get them from, selling keys for 2.33 refined seems fair to me. It's a reasonable price. It'll still take time for some users to save up for

**TL;DR - Key prices are too high. For most people, is by selling keys for 2.33 refined. I believe that is, and always has been, the true key price.**

Ever since then
For those of you who missed the previous post

###What is Mist?###
Mist is a portable
Mist is something I decided to write because I love doing trades, and would miss out on business deals.  
So Mist is intended to be a solution for that. It's portable and doesn't require Steam
Mist is built on top of SteamBot (https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamBot/) and heavily uses its underlying functions to handle chat and trading. And of course
Scroll to the bottom for the source-code and download link.

###Features###

~~**MIST IS STILL VERY MUCH IN BETA.**~~ Mist is a lot stabler now. But still, I'll be able to get it as stable as possible. I wouldn't recommend it for high-value, important trades at the moment, just to be on the safe side.

[Screenshots Gallery](http://imgur.com/a/Lwlwc)

* Works with SteamGuard - no need to disable it to use Mist  
* Chat with friends  
* Trade TF2 items - you are limited to trading only TF2 items for now. Adding other types of items will cause the trade to expire.  
* Change display name and status  
* Add friends  
* Block/ignore friends  
* Backpack viewer - view anyone's backpack directly from within the program!  
* SteamRep Checker - check any of your friends' SteamRep status  
* More to come?  

###What doesn't work###

* ~~Friend requests are not shown in Mist. You will have to accept/ignore them manually via steamcommunity.com. This feature will be implemented in a later release~~ **This has now been added**  
* Can only trade TF2 items  
* Occasionally adding items will cause the trade to crash and expire. This is rare but it happens. Close the chat tab
* Searching for friends - this is planned for a later release  
* **Linux support** - unfortunately Mist is not compatible with Linux

###Feedback

He was added by a person trying to buy his unusual. (See: [chatlog](http://puu.sh/2hH5V.png))

The scammer posted a link to their actual SteamRep profile
However

http://steamrep.com/profiles/76561198068807468?t=1345099378

Notice the ?t=1345099378 at the end? This tells SteamRep to pull the profile data **[from a previous point in time](http://puu.sh/2hHis.png)**. When my friend first showed me the link

Removing ?t=1345099378 from the URL turns it into http://steamrep.com/profiles/76561198068807468 which in fact shows that [the user is a scammer](http://puu.sh/2hHgW.png).

**This is a serious flaw in SteamRep.** I believe that viewing historical data should still show that the user is *currently* a scammer

This flaw needs to be fixed ASAP.

Edit: SteamRep has now been updated to make it more clear that it is showing historical data. http://steamrep.com/profiles/76561198068807468?t=1345099378

1362873339.0,19zvu2,[PSA] Remember when I released the source code for my keybanking bot? Now here's the source code for my scrapbanking bot.,waylaidwanderer,54,5,19,"**Edit (March 10 4:50 AM): I've just fixed a small line of code which caused the bot to fail to ready up and accept the trade. If you've tried to compile the bot or you've forked it

Hi everyone. You may remember that I released the source code for my [keybanking bot](https://gist.github.com/waylaidwanderer/5127827) a few months ago.

Well, and this time I'm here to give you the source code for my scrapbanking bot! Scrapbanking bots are easy to run, since they don't require you to be rich in TF2 to stock their inventories, and so it's easy to set one up for your own community if you wish to :)

This particular scrapbanking bot of mine does scrap banking and reverse banking. This means that it will sell any 2 weapons for 1 scrap, you can recode it for-profit if you'd like.

**[You can find the source code as a Gist here.](https://gist.github.com/waylaidwanderer/5126244)**

The scrapbanking bot is coded in C# using Jessecar96 and Geel9's [**SteamBot**](https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamBot/)

Once you have SteamBot set up, you can just replace the contents of SimpleUserHandler.cs with the scrapbanking bot's source code.

**If you do decide to use the scrapbanking code for your own purposes**: it'd be nice if you gave me credit somewhere to let your users know! (You don't need to

----------------------

**How to use the scrapbanking bot when trading**

* If you are selling weapons, hit enter, and then type in what weapon you want. For example, if you wanted to buy The Original, type ""original"" and the bot will automatically add it for you if he has one in stock. To add multiple weapons at once, you can separate each search term with a comma. For example, you can type ""original, type ""remove""

----------------------

**Credit where credit is due - thanks to:**

* Jessecar96 and Geel9 for the inception of SteamBot
* All of SteamBot's [wonderful contributors](https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamBot/graphs/contributors)
* [Derongan](http://www.reddit.com/u/derongan) for helping me out a ton when I first started coding my scrapbanking bot

1359515800.0,17jf3c,[PSA] backpack.tf prices integrated into tf2outpost,giggly_kisses,50,2,81,"I just wanted to let everyone know that I just finished writing a plugin that grabs the prices of items from backpack.tf and displays them on tf2outpost. 

I got the idea from [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/17c6dc/hprogramming_ability_w_to_make_a_website_to/) thread where I came upon a post stating that the old user script that someone wrote is outdated; specifically [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/11p0lv/psa_tf2outpost_and_backpacktf_integration_script/) script.

Unfortunately the plugin only works on Chrome as of right now

As far as features go it only grabs the prices from TF2 and displays them. I do however plan on adding more features in the future (which is why I ported it from a user script to a Chrome extension; I can push updates when features are done).

You can install it as a [user script](https://github.com/kschat/tf2outpost-prices) (requires Grease/TamperMonkey; also won't be updated in the future) or as a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tf2outpost-price-integrat/ndflpbfgklcjpkepbmfgjjancaocpnmp/details?hl=en&amp;gl=US) (will be updated in the future).

Please let me know what you guys think

EDIT: There was a bug with cross domain requesting and permissions with the Chrome extension. It's fixed now. Make sure you have version 1.1.4

EDIT 2: If you had a version that wasn't working and updated  ake sure you clear your cache and data hosted by apps after you update (it might be reading for a ""corrupt"" value in local storage).

EDIT 3: to anyone who is getting an error saying ""Download was not a CRX"" it's a bug with the Google Web Store. According to [this](http://www.ghacks.net/2012/12/07/fix-chrome-error-download-was-not-a-crx/) you need to be logged into the store to fix the bug. 

UPDATE: Version 1.1.6 has been released. It now factors in paint to the price of painted items. I also added a ""never ending tf2outpost"" feature (much like the ""never ending reddit"" RES feature).

So I got this bright idea to give my Unusual away today

Hat in question is a Armored Authority with Purple Confetti

First the why: It's fun as hell to do and brings a little bit of joy to my day

Next, don't be an ass and let someone else have a shot at one. 

So there it is. A free unusual to one lucky redditor. Btw, so did it here instead. GOOD LUCK EVERYONE! LET THE GAMES BEGIN!",,False,,t5_2s0s4,True,default donor,

One last thing for those of you who made it this far.  While I was scrapbanking some sneaky person has given me 6 uncraftable weapons.  So my loss is your gain.  If you want these weapons to use and not to craft you can have them absolutely free.  There are ~~1 jarate~~, ~~1 eyelander~~, ~~1 shortstop and 1 sandvich~~.  1 free weapon per person please, gotta share the love.

No problem! Just follow these easy steps:

2) Once in

3) Enter the following:

* cl_drawhud 0

* cam_idealdistup -20

For cam_idealdist I switch it up between 60 and 80.  Try different values to see which ones you like best.

Your goal now is to get into third-person view.  You can either...

(A) Use one of your taunts and take a screenshot while taunting...  Or...

(B) Find an area with a nice background and then enter the following in the console

* thirdperson
* thirdperson_mayamode

This will put you into third-person mode and freeze the camera in place.  You can then rotate your character to face the camera and take a screenshot.

---

Hey again! 

Decided to update my spreadsheet calculating the profitability of uncrating.  The previous thread was [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/wb3jh/psa_the_truth_behind_mann_co_supply_crates/).

I updated old prices for all series

I grabbed all the data I could from backpack.tf/unusual.  Piped each hat to Sheet2 of the spreadsheet and found out I could just grab the data from the website on demand through excel.  If you download the spreadsheet

Then to get that data in an easier format to work with, but the script didn't take entirely too long to write and can easily deal with updates in prices.

For those not familiar with Python

Some notable things:
---

* Remember: Both the sell value of the crate and the value of the key are subtracted from the value of the items you might uncrate.
* Crates are now profitable
* This is because of a calculated average unusual cost of 3.73 buds

*Note: For those who wanted the st dev
---

Table: Crates by order of profitability of opening

EV= Expected Value

I multiplied the value of the items you can unbox by the rate at which they are unboxed.  Summed all that and subtracted the value of the crate and key.

1. Keys are easily divided now. 1/2 of a key is 2 ref, etc., as all you have to do is divide 4 by the required amount and round to closest scrap(instead of 2.33 or 3.77, ugh).

2. Keys go 1:3 with craft hats. Seriously a big feature when you can easily trade hats instead of metal without having to calculate change. This could be even more awesome if scrap.tf allowed you to sell 3 hats for 1 key (or vice versa) in just one trade!

3. Larger value currencies are also easily traded for metal and hats. Bills are exactly 32 ref, or 858-972 hats! And all this with an easy to remember formula- just multiply keys by 4 for ref prices, or by 3 for hat prices.

Hey guys

You may know me from [an announcement I made](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/ws4ye/psa_come_join_the_community_trade_server_where/) last week about setting up a new trade server

It hasn't been that popular, and have more people join, and hopefully come back regularly?"" 

With the help and valuable input of Heisenberg, which will be taking place this Saturday, with a grand prize for the winner... and his partner. 

""His parter?"" You ask. That's right! 

On **Saturday

---------------------------------

###**The Event**


The rules are simple. 

There will be 14 players on each team. 7 snipers

The map will have a divide in the middle. Snipers cannot cross to the other side of the map

**The Sniper Loadout:**

Primary: The Huntsman  
Secondary: Jarate   
Melee: Kukri  


**The Spy Loadout:**

Primary: Revolver  
Secondary: Invis Watch  
Melee: Knife  


Each sniper will be partnered with a spy (so tell a friend about this event!)

There will be 3 ""pre-final"" rounds. The last sniper standing on both Red and Blu will win a prize (and his/her spy partner too) and will be allowed to enter the semi-final round. They must then sit out for the 2nd ""pre-final"" round while the process repeats

There are two semi-final rounds. 

In the first round, then we must have a Red team winning the second time). 

For the final round

And that's it for the rules!

I will be announcing the grand prizes (one for the Sniper and one for the Spy, the winners will get even more cool stuff! 

#**If you are interested in registering for this tournament

The list of competitors will be announced on **~~Wednesday~~ Thursday**

Now

------------------------------------

###**The Giveaway**

There will be a giveaway every day of this week up until the Saturday event. The prizes will get better and better!

Today's prize: Degreaser, incidentally).

Pick a number **between 1 and 200**. Please do a Ctrl+F and make sure your number is not already taken! If multiple people have the same winning number

What is this hat you ask? 

It is the mighty fine **Circling Peace Sign Bonk Helm**.

How is it themed one might dare to question. The answer is simple.

 The king of cheap drinks and Iced teas (Arizona) has a beverage called Peace Tea. Peace Tea is peace related. AND comes in cans. This hat is both Peace related and it has cans on not just ONE SIDE

Now you might be questioning whether or not this mighty fine hat even worthy of you to own it. (Don't worry you all can have a chance to own it for the right price) BUT this hat will not discriminate against anybody or anything because it is peaceful. A whole **two cans** of peaceful.

Now you may be saying, but I've been around for awhile, and have done everything from trading unusuals, to games, to keys and metal. I can hopefully outline some things to help you awesome redditors out! Now then, enough of introductions, let's get down to business...


**The Basics**

Okay, here are the general value of some of the ""currency"" items of tf2:

* [Refined Metal](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Refined#Metal) - 1 Ref (Around $0.55 atm)
Please note: 1 Scrap = .11 Refined

* [Keys](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Key) - 2.44-2.55 Ref (Around $1.45 atm)

* [Bills Hat](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Earbuds) - 8-9 keys (Unpainted) or 9-10 keys (Painted) (Generally $10-$11.50)

* [Earbuds](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Earbuds) - 24-25 keys($28-$30 atm). Buds are king
* [Severed Max Head](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Refined#Metal) - Around 2.33-2.5 buds each ($65-$70)

These are the current values of each currency item. Please note that buds are really changing constantly

**Knowing The Value Of Your Items**

If you're looking to get into trading

* [Tf2 Spreadsheet:](http://tf2spreadsheet.blogspot.com/)


This spreadsheet is great for giving ballpark estimates of what your items and valuables should go for. Of course it's not 100% accurate

* [TF2 Unusual:](http://tf2unusual.com/tf2/)


Not sure what your unusual is worth, is great for giving an okay estimate at what the demand for your unusual is. Be sure to take prices with a grain of salt here, as anybody can put any sort of number they want. By no means use it as a solid price checker, but it *can* be a good place to find somebody interested in your unusual.


* Want a more in-depth look at unusual values? I've made a small Google Doc which can be viewed here:

 [TF2 Unusuals And You](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W8wnhJRbk8wKlhqyPse37rjbllFSgkvIzACVL6KFqLI/edit)

* You can also check out [Burpman's](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Burpman/) Unusual guide [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/ocjn7/a_guide_to_unusual_value/)



**Trading Your Things**
Now then, but there are also a number of other venues for you to sell all your shineys!


[TF2 Outpost](http://www.tf2outpost.com/):
TF2 Outpost is a fantastic website for all of your trading needs. Unusuals, even Steam games. Anything you've got, they'll list! You can also comment and view other peoples' comments there, so it's much like Reddit.


[TF2 Trading Post](http://tf2tp.com/)
While a little bulkier and less popular now-a-days


[Sourceop](http://www.sourceop.com/)
Used mostly for unusual trading, and lots of other things for all of your unusual and high-value trading desires.


**Scammers: What to Expect
Luckily, and become well situated with it if you wish to trade for cash later on! As a rule of thumb, always look for a high rep person, or worst case scenario, *always* have a middleman ready.


**Hints and Tips**

* For those looking to uncrate:
Buy keys from here, and I've even sold some keys to two people who've unboxed unusuals.

* For those looking for price checks and other such things:
My Unusual trading Google Doc above gives two great websites for getting people to price check things


**The Wrap Up**
So that's about it for now. You know the values, the best advice I can give is to just keep it up! Play to your hearts desire, and remember, every week you get more items from random drops, which you'll be able to trade and sell and build yourself up. If you have any questions, or just want to chat with me, feel free to add me through my flair or by visiting my profile [here](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sound_Off). I'd be more than happy to try to answer any questions you may have.


Thanks for taking the time to read this long guide

I know we had a few problems with the system


**************************************

It is also time for the ugly part of the exchange that I wish I didn't have to do. We will now start sanctioning those who haven't delivered their gifts to their giftees. Only a few cases have risen


If you have received a matching PM in the past, but have not been able to, don't worry; message me with the title ""**No Chimney**"", and the details.

All shafted participants will get a gift one way or another, and I'll take care of you personally if I have to :D

Remember that if you think you signed up, but out poor little bot (programmed by the amazing [Virindi](http://www.reddit.com/user/virindi), without who's help none of this would have been possible) sometimes couldn't handle some of Reddit's hiccups. We'll have more time to avoid this in the future.

**************************

**And now for the awesomeness!**

Be sure to visit /r/tf2gifts to browse through some of the gifts! Many, and gave away everything from personalized unusuals to great games!

**Be back @ ~5-6 or 7-8pm EST**

Hey there r/tf2trade

---

Ever want a screenshot of you and all of those funny things you wear on your head

For a limited time (until mid-April) I shall be taking screenshots (and even editing them!) for **free**!

*(Donations appreciated

---

So how does this work? Easy! Just follow these steps:

* **Know what you want a screenshot of** - *I mainly take shots of Unusuals

* *Try* to **think of a map/setting you'd like as a background** - *Example: Burning Hats go nicely with a dark background, and so on*

* **Comment/PM/Add me!**

After doing all of this

* **Discuss/Plan**

* **Run around a server and pose/taunt/do whatever**! I'll be a spectator taking screenshots of you ^ ^

---

**No trust required

---

**Here's what I've done so far** (as seen on my [tf2outpost trade](http://www.tf2outpost.com/trade/634415)):

This means that r/tf2trade will be inaccessible for the afternoon of the previously stated date. You won't be able to post trades during the blackout.

If you're planning on trading on the stated date or are thinking about it but have no plans exactly, [TF2TP](http://tf2tp.com), or, in the worst case scenario, trade servers.

There have been no plans from the r/tf2trade mods and server admins on whether or not the trade servers will go dark, no trade server blackout is planned. Other trade servers not those of r/tf2trade will likely stay up, but they could decide to black out too.~~ **edit: lawlyer confirms no trade server/chat room blackout will take place: http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/oblrz/attentionpsa_plan_on_finding_other_trading/c3fylwx?context=3**

While Valve has not been approached about SOPA/PIPA, but still a possibility. Do note that the previously mentioned sites may also be blacking out too, but you'll likely receive warning through their notification systems.

1312972419.0,jegmi,PROPOSED RULE: You may trade for games available on Steam ,lawlyer,47,6,17,"Since people are already posting trades with games

Below is the proposed rule for allowing the trade of games. Keep in mind

In the mean time

***
**RULE FOR TRADING STEAM GAMES IN /r/TF2TRADE**

1. The proposed game to be traded must be able to be traded in the Steam trade window via Steam trade.

2. The trade **must** have TF2 items involved

3. Know the value of your TF2 items. You won't be able to trade for a $50 game with only equalizers and backburners.  

4. The moderators and game admins take zero responsibility and will have zero recourse available if the other party does not complete the trade.

5. No posts will be allowed complaining of another person backing out of a trade.

6. It is preferred that the user already **own** the copy of the game they want to trade.

7. ""[H] (insert game here) [W] Offers"" is not acceptable. You must state exactly what items you want offered.
***

**Note on scams:** Trade at your own risk. Currently

* It is *highly* suggested that you demo your screen when conducting these trades. 

* It is *highly* suggested to not purchase games for a trade

* Watch the ""Item"" text box to ensure what has been put in the box is what you think has been put in the box.

**Remember:** Best trade practices do apply. Always research the other guy, it is done



**tl;dr:** This whole thing is kind of important. Read it.",,t5_2s0s4,True,,trusted hat,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/jegmi/proposed_rule_you_may_trade_for_games_available/

http://steamcommunity.com/id/key-seller/

Follow the instructions to buy keys.

**How much does it cost?**

The price will fluctuate

**What's the current stock?**

Type stock in the chat box to display the current stock.

**Why is your bot trying to communicate?**

Any non-command chat message will trigger a response from Cleverbot.

**Any known bugs?**

If you purchase a large amount of keys

For a few users

**How can I be sure it works?**

I am the owner and the only admin of the bot. If anything goes wrong

You can find my rep [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/1k0qv3/h_keys_w_170_each_paypal/)

Additionally

**What if I decide to initiate a chargeback?**

Don't do that. Contact me if you want a refund.

**Is this thing on 24/7?**

Yes

**What's with the flat fee?**

PayPal's fault. It should be less than or equivalent to the fee you pay when buying keys from a human. There are no other fees here.

**And what's that about free keys?**

If you find a bug that allows an user to get free keys or stops the bot from confirming a payment

I'm curious if the representative even actually read my e-mail.

EDIT: For those of you who don't get what happened, and he still has his beanie (I was prepared to give him it if steam support had wrongly robbed him of it because of my e-mail). So basically I suspect that the steam support rep duplicated the hat the I traded and gave me ""back"" my hat. 

DOUBLE EDIT: Just checked TF2items.com. The Beanie is indeed a duplicate of the one that had I traded

1327551630.0,ox5a5,Account suspended unfairly,LeonSK,50,6,18,"On January 19

http://steamcommunity.com/id/lexmaximus/

Then i proced to contact Steam Support...

Meanwhile i was checking my bp (Cuz i think i was suspend because some protection about someone hijack my account) and see some Vintage Hats i trade early that day was missing

This is the trade i see and did:
www.tf2tp.com/trade.php?trade=5285405
•	He is trading 32 Vintage Hats for 1 Earbuds.

My BP at Begging that day:
http://www.tf2items.com/id/lexmaximus?time=1326953134
•	You can see i have 5 buds (Note especially LV45).

My BP after i did the trade:
http://www.tf2items.com/id/lexmaximus?time=1326998018
•	I have the 32 Vintage Hats and the buds lv 45 gone.

My BP Now:
http://www.tf2items.com/id/lexmaximus

Him BP Now:
http://www.tf2items.com/profiles/76561197991276565

So i think he trick Steam Support say i scammed him. 

I have a lot of reports of scammers on “Sourceop Scammer database”

I dont see this before

What reply Steam Support:

---
First Answer:
Thank you for contacting Steam Support.

We are investigating this issue further. As soon as we have more information
---

---
Second:
Your account was disabled due to scamming or hijacking another user's account in Team Fortress 2. This violates the Steam Subscriber Agreement and /or Steam's Rules of Online Conduct.

Per the Steam Subscriber Agreement

The Steam Subscriber Agreement can be found at:
http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/

In addition to violation of contract
---

I already negate that and i ask for more info or what suposedly i scammed or hack ...

How is posible Steam Support believe on some user with only 0.2 hours instand of my i have 1000 hours...

I post a new thread on Steam forums and was deleted... Why? I dont know. I see a lot of threads of that type and none is delete... Why mine is deleted?

If some one can trace this item history:

http://www.tf2items.com/item/666534511 (Earbuds LV45)

If you see this item was traded ""supposedly"" on date : January 20

This cant happen because i trade this item to this account: 

1. http://www.tf2items.com/profiles/76561197991276565 on date January 19 (For the Vintage Hats). 
2. My account was suspend on January 19. 

I apreciate the help you can give me guys or any other thing i can do...

**EDIT :**
Ok finally a clear answer about my suspend and some progress:
&gt;We have revised our decision and your account is now enabled
&gt;
&gt;Your trading privileges have been suspended permanently. We have a zero tolerance policy for scamming.

So this was because i trade the V. Hats for the buds from a Hjjacked account... 

In part is my fault because dont check the profile before of did the trade but this can happen to anyone. Now before we can make the trade we need: 1. Check Profile 2. Search on google if someone report 3. Finally do the trade..

Now im trying get back my trading privileges.",,t5_2s0s4,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/ox5a5/account_suspended_unfairly/

--------------------------


Go to steam settings

First thing I do when trading someone is grab their steamID from their profile and paste it into steamrep.com. If it comes up clean

I'll usually have a look at their profile next, that's another warning sign. 

If they have profile rep, or a SOP rep thread. Profile rep is extremely easily faked. 

Also, just click on the SteamID in the SOP rep thread and check that you're added to the guys friends list, or check that the hours played match up with the person you're trading with. 

Middlemen, and have in the past.) If they invite a middleman to the trade, ask for the middleman's rep thread and again, **VERIFY YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE CORRECT PERSON** I can not stress this enough, if you don't do that you're going to end up being scammed. 

Now onto paypal. It's fairly simple what you're able to do - Make sure it's sent as a gift. It'll say payment type ""Instant"" down at the bottom. If there's any crap about shipping details or anything unusual that you don't normally see

Unfortunately, but if you're dealing with someone who you think is a bit sketchy - ask them if their paypal is verified. Verified means that you have linked your bank account to your paypal account, and thus means claiming fraudulent payments is a lot more risky for them. Unverified means they've not got a credit card linked to their account, and can easily just claim fraudulent payment and take their money back with little repercussion. It will show you on the payment details page if the person is ""Non-US verified"" or ""Verified"". If you're ever unsure of a person and they don't have a verified account, don't do the trade. 


And the last thing i'd like to say:

If someone comes to you offering your buyout on a hat, when in reality it's just a scammer trying to fog their senses with greed. **If you are ever unsure of a trade, do not do it.**

Here's a few useful links:

Hope that helped

**An added tip from Mattie/thorax:**

Before doing a transaction over PayPal

https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_seal-entry&amp;pal=THEIR_EMAIL@ADDRESS.COM

Replacing the all-caps part with their email address. This will tell you 2 key things (1) the date they started their PayPal account and (2) whether they are Verified.

Both of these are useful bits of information to have because if it's too new or not Verified

Don't let greed cloud your judgement! Slow and steady and careful wins the race.

How I proceeded after downloading the files:

- Tried to open them. they were 3 .scr files (screensaver). Nothing happened.

- Panicked. Opened Spybot Search &amp; Destroy shredder. Managed to shred one file. (This might have saved my account in the end). The others were already gone

- It was a virus, it said 'Valve' account. ^ ^

- I tried to trade my earbuds and unus. away. Thanks IRL friends and Holy Crap
Steam closed during this time and the trade window closed too. I had to open it up multiple times.

- Told my friends to reset my steam and mail accounts. Saved the most important files

- Reinstalled Windows with the available option in windows 8. The apps reinstall automatically

- Turns out I forgot an earbud in my backpack. It's still there. Apart from that

WARNING: WALL OF TEXT. SKIP TO THE BOTTOM IF YOU JUST WANT THE RAFFLE.

Hi everyone! (Look for how to enter the new raffle at the bottom of this thread

***Please help this get as much attention as possible. You know what to do! :3***

Remember me? I sure hope you do! I'm waylaidwanderer, for the past few months, it's been pretty much dead. Most people would connect, see an empty server... and then leave! :'( So what I've been trying to do is to liven up the place and get tons of people on it!

For the past week, all in an effort to fill up my servers with people. Each post has drawn a lot of attention, and with the tons of participants (and over 500 entries total), I managed to get more than 50 people to join my [Steam Group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CTSCommunity)! Not bad! However, my servers ***are still dead***! Yes, you heard that right. They've mostly been in the same state as before, with a few extra people due to the raffles. At most we've had ~10 people on my trade server

So now, it comes with **conditions**. No more just typing a random entry phrase in the hopes of winning a free item in my raffles - this time, if you want the prizes, you're going to have to work for it! But not too hard!

---------------------------

I made that account when my current account was banned by Steam due to account sharing (GO DOTA2). I stopped using that account once I reclaimed this. WHY am I keeping them on an alt? Cause I trade using this account and don't want any hackers to get their eyes on to this. I don't give much worth to Steam Security after Mattie's and the Director's accounts got hacked. Not to mention Sunspy( i THINK).

We have also teamed up with the great people at /r/NewToTF2 to help new players reach us.

**EDIT:**  Looks were about 2 hours from the start of this thing. I will probably be dropping in periodically on the tf2trade server to have some fun and maybe do some smaller give aways (hats, however the big give aways will come in the next couple of days. I will probably ask on here for some advice on them since they seemed to get a bit confusing on the Unusual Hat give away from before. I now have all the crates I need. Looks like I will be going in with **22** 30 crates to uncrate. The others will mostly consist of crate 1s, 19s, and 32-34s. 

Its that time again! Time to aimlessly waste 100 keys in a big back to back uncrating on one of the r/tf2 trade servers. I am going with the tf2trade.com server this time. I will be doing 100 crate live around 10 pm CST tomorrow evening (Saturday that is

Now as most of you know from when I have did this before (you would probably recognize my tf2 name as Kevin Spacey)

I am currently still looking for a few specific crates

Well guys

* Please use tags in your title. [H] Have, but with dozens upon dozens of new posts made each day, keeping things  orderly makes scanning new posts easier for everyone.

* You need to have an idea of what your looking to get for your stuff. Vague ""want offers"" posts are just frustrating for everybody involved and either lead to no responses, and we suggest you qualify ""offers"" with ""want XX buds in value"".

* As it stands

* Lowballing, but *not* considered scamming. We strive to be a fairly safe place for trading, and part of that is educating inexperienced traders. Please refrain from contacting mods/admins looking to get somebody banned because they offered you a couple of Strange Weapons for your unusual. Either educate them on values, or block them on Steam and never have to deal with them again. If somebody makes a post wildly over/under-valuing their item, make a comment, but don't crap in somebody's thread over a couple scrap.

* Posting your Steam ID without a working link is next to useless. People will have to comb Google and the Steam Community website

Speaking of which

* Go to [SteamRep](http://steamrep.com/) and enter your Profile Name.

---  

**RULES

---

1.  Prices are set in stone for the most part

2.  I *can* trade for other Unusuals

3.  I have no interest in: *anything* besides **Buds**, I don't have time to re-sell random stuff anymore :&lt;

4.  **All sales are final.**  I leave it to the buyer to do their own research.  Buyer's remorse is not my problem.

5.  Unusuals that have been ~~sold~~ will have their names ~~crossed out.~~

6.  **Do not add me unless you are paying the exact listed price in Buds/Keys/$USD.**

7.  For cash trades

8.  [**Here is my SourceOP Rep (click).**](http://forums.sourceop.com/threads/123164-Varren-s-Rep-Thread!)  You'll be going first unless you've got more rep than me.

9.  I reserve the right to not trade with anyone for any reason.

10.  If you have any questions

---

**HOW I VALUE THINGS**

---

Currently

* 1 Bud = 27 Keys
* 1 Key = $1.35 USD

Hat prices in $USD are based on Keys.

---

**SCREENSHOTS**

---

They can ALL be found [here (click)](http://thegoddamnhatman.imgur.com/).

Pro-Tip: Use ""Ctrl+F"" to find the hat you want to see.

Every hat that has a visible album is for sale

Please don't hate me :(


Recently the cost of server and bot hosting has risen dramatically. While we have been surviving on donations for a long time, we have decided to make the subreddit open to all who donate one key a month.

_____________________________

With the recent addition of our Donation Bot

________

1.  Add our bot via his [profile](http://i.imgur.com/o4WdHCE.png) or this link [here](steam://friends/add/76561198075186001)
2. [Send our bot a trade!](http://i.imgur.com/407DVxw.png) He will accept if he is not currently trading someone else
3. Sometimes the trade will encounter [an error
4. After successfully entering a trade
5. The bot will tell you [how long](http://i.imgur.com/R2Tncel.png) you have subcribed for!
6. The bot will then automatically [delete you](http://i.imgur.com/dFG5AQi.png)

_________

Thank you for your understanding and we hope to see you for many years to come.

FAQ
___________
&gt;**Can I donate other items?**
&gt;&gt;No. For now

__________

&gt;**What if I encounter an error?**
&gt;&gt;As this technology is new

_______

&gt;**Will /r/tf2trade ever be free again?**
&gt;&gt;As this is a pilot program, have to close the subreddit. At this point, even one refined could make the difference between making us, and breaking us.

__________

&gt;**What will happen if I do not donate?**
&gt;&gt;On April 2nd those who have not donated will temporarily lose their flair until they donate sufficient funds to be resubscribed to the subreddit.

_________

&gt;**I don't have enough funds to donate! What do I do?**
&gt;&gt;It is understandable that some newer traders will not have the ability to pay a key every month to use the subreddit. Unfortunately

___________

&gt;**Who wrote this sexy bot?**
&gt;&gt;None other than the steamy /u/drkabob!

I'm not kidding...,supsky,50,7,56,"In the past few days I've been getting almost 2 friend requests every hour from random Russian people asking if I'm selling hats. I've never posted anywhere that I'm selling hats so why would people even think this? The thing that is weird about this is I haven't posted my steam name anywhere besides reddit in 3 weeks (outpost). And yes

So my question here is really why this could be happening so suddenly

Edit: Actually one of I'd say the 20ish was very nice. He was very polite and reasonable but the others are all mean. 

The weirdest one was about the 4th guy who added me and when I said hello he replied ""I'm not going to buy any of ur fuckin hats"". So he added me just to tell me that he didn't want to buy any of the hats that I wasn't even selling in the first place. wat

Be aware, Mehberry has already started enforcing these ""mini-rules"", I just wanted to get the word out.

_____

**Nether Camping:**

--------

AS OF JUNE 26TH

____

_When it is camping:_

* Blocking the entrance in anyway

If you put a dispenser, you are officially camping.

_Allowed/Not allowed:_

* No sentries in the Nether spawn at all.

Clickers are not allowed under this rule (in the spawn).

* Sentries in Nether outside of spawn are allowed

This means they can be everywhere in the Nether (excluding the spawn). 

* Players can kill if stuck by other players.

This was allowed before. Don't stand near the spawn.

* Players can kill in spawn.

I know that I personally have enforced a no-kill zone in spawn

* Groups of 4+ are not allowed to kill.

This affects the Nether spawn only. Outside groups of 4+ is allowed.

---------------------

This is different than the previous ""rule"" as it was just a general ""don't do it"". 

Mehberry has made a spray that usually goes in the Nether spawn anyways

I also pop onto the trade server every now and then to give away free stuff if there's a fair amount of people

**One last note**

If you'd like to help out with these raffles, you can request a crappily drawn picture of a cat!***

1347914742.0,101hsm,[Q] Anyone noticing oddities with backpack.tf price changes?,IKabobI,44,4,41,"I've started using backpack.tf as a pricing resource a lot lately but over the past few days I'm wondering why they are deciding to accept/deny price changes.  Here's two quick examples that leave me scratching my head.

Yesterday someone proposed a price drop of the [Strange Shotgun](http://backpack.tf/vote/id/5055ea279ae21a6207000000) from 2.88 ref to 2.55 ref.  A total of 23 people voted on it and the vote was split at 13 for and 10 against or +3 (not even enough to show the total votes in overview) yet the price was accepted and changed relatively quickly.  I don't think there was nearly enough evidence provided to warrant a switch

Last week someone voted to drop the price of the Genuine Quadwrangler from 10 to 9 ref and it passed.  Yesterday someone proposed [a price revert](http://backpack.tf/vote/id/50569ffc9ae21a4c70000000) as evidence suggested that they were still selling strongly at 10 ref.  With the vote sitting at 45 for and 6 against or +39 the suggestion is suddenly closed.

I'm not suggestion that there is some sort of behind the scenes price fixing or anything but I know the creator of backpack.tf has posted on here a few times and I'm just trying to get some clarification as to the methodology of approving/rejecting a pricing suggestion.",,t5_2s0s4,False,,default,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/101hsm/q_anyone_noticing_oddities_with_backpacktf_price/

1329510701.0,puc5b,[PSA] Steam trading for games is still very risky. Here's a way to protect yourselves a bit more if you decide to do so.,rolmos,45,5,40,"Remember that fraudulent purchases are very common

Steam does try to help people that get affected by such game copies:

https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9958-MJDG-3003

&gt; **What if a game I received in a trade is fraudulently purchased?**


&gt; If this happens


I'm highlighting the last part, was gifted to a friend for his birthday (he obviously didn't give me anything for it). The game was revoked, and Steam couldn't/wouldn't restore anything to *me*.

**********************


This would have been avoided the following way:

Never trade for a game without giving something back for it. **NEVER**.

* Before gifting the game

* Trade the copy of the game for the items. 

This way



If you are buying games while paying with cash, if a sold game is revoked, you're basically on your own.

Since all cash sales **should** involve middlemen

* The game seller sends the game to the middleman.

* You

* When the payment is done


This way, you can work something out with the seller and middleman to protect yourself in a similar way. 

******************************

The best way not to get scammed trading for games is to only buy from trustworthy traders that bought the games themselves.

**TL;DR** Never trade Steam games without having something on the other side of the trade window of the same value,False,,t5_2s0s4,False,,trusted hat donor,t3_puc5b

""I doubt there's anything that can be done at this point, if there's something that can be done.

I posted [this appeal](http://unusualtradingcommunity.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=6179) on the UTC forums. Not because I was hunted down, and overall, trying to be a positive influence. I've helped people sell Max Heads for charity, worked on organizing a free TF2 league for reddit, (Scalia can tell you how well that went...) and stay an active member of the trading community.

I brought up the ban with Atom because I wanted to see if there was anything that could be done about getting the scammed person the items they deserved. As expected, I was informed that I would now have to argue a case against the ban being moved to my account. Aren't the point of SteamRep bans to warn against harmful traders? I've had multiple opportunities to steal hundreds of dollars in stuff, and always, always, ended up helping out for free with no strings attached. Am I really a threat of some kind, one that needs to be publicly defaced?

Do you guys have any suggestions of what to do? I felt you guys would understand more than anyone else how this can be something more than a simple hobby, over something a friend did, on a different account, a half year ago, without my knowledge, that I then brought up in an attempt to rectify would be such a big deal.""

I created a ""Price Calculator"". Yeah, you can either select buds or keys, then you type in the amount. 

For example; You put in 2.55 keys and it tells you that's 2 keys, 1 scrap, and 1 weapon.

The price from keys and buds are automatically pulled in from backpack.tf

1367249045.0,1dcbg5,"[PSA] For the last month, I've been tracking keys, metal, and key prices.",,6

Metal and key numbers are taken from stats.tf

****

**Finds**

* Keys increase in price roughly 1.5 scrap per week.
* Number of keys has come back up significantly.
* Key price correlates more to the amount of metal and not really to the amount of keys.
* Ratio of keys to metal has been pretty steady for about 2 weeks.

****

So this suggests some possible solutions to rising key prices.  The obvious is to address the increase in amount of metal.  Drop rate could be altered, based on the trends I do not believe keys will come down by sheer force of traders; it will have to come from Valve.

Hey /r/tf2trade

Yet again, kindly donated by fellow tf2trader /u/kahafb!

Let's list the rules of this little raffle first (powered by redditraffle.com) before I go on my spiel (again).

To enter this raffle

* Have a Reddit account **at least** a week old
* Have flair (**Non-negotiable
* Include the word ""spah"" in your comment - don't combine it with other words though (**SUPER IMPORTANT!**)
* Upvote this post (well, feel free!)

And that's it for the rules! Everyone has an equal chance to win!

--------------------------------

***Now onto the purpose of this raffle...***

I run 3 servers (trade, and it's my dream to see them grow popular and have lots of people play on them. From my previous efforts, I've managed to be able to see a little community grow, but I'd love to see it grow even more.

So what I'd like *you* to do is to check out my servers! Favourite them

Sometimes you'll join my servers and find them empty! But that's okay! You simply need to invite some friends, it'll be full! Running these servers is a **team effort**, mentlegen, and I'm proud to have you as part of my team.

My servers are run with a simple philosophy: **community**. I like to foster an environment where everyone can chill and have a good time, and have fun!

Would you like to help out? Join my [***new*** Steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CTSCommunity) and read about how you can contribute to the CTS community! The reason this Steam group is new is because I felt the old name was, and getting bigger, and thus it needed a new name: The CTS Community.

Check out the CTS commmunity's [sexy new website](http://www.thectscommunity.com/) where you can read about the CTS, which serves the same purpose essentially. The CTS also uses [HLStatsX](http://www.thectscommunity.com/stats/hlstats.php) so you can keep track of your kills and stuff. Visit the page [here](http://www.thectscommunity.com/stats/hlstats.php) and type ""hlx"" in game to check out your ranking!

Also, and a section for posting trades as well. Register there and introduce yourself, and I'll do my best to make you feel welcome! I hope to be able to hold private CTS-exclusive raffles and contests there one day once it gets popular enough.

Or you can just **hop right in** and join any of my 3 servers! Simply click the IP to join if Steam is running!

1342379098.0,wlqdn,[H] A PayPal issue. [W] No upvotes and help.,tuxisme,54,18,17,"I posted yesterday about buying keys over PayPal

The issue at hand

My plan was this:

1. Go purchase a Visa Gift Card.

2. Add the funds from it to PayPal.

3. ???

4. Keys for days.

The problem came around step 2.

Apparently, meaning it can't be used or linked to the PayPal account. I've seen a few conflicting answers on the matter.

As a note

So


---

**1.** Is there a way to add this card to PayPal? If so

**2.** Are there any alternate ways I could pay a seller? Ones that don't involve PayPal?

The story was I wanted to sell my first ever unusual i had ever owned, you probably seen that trade on [/r/tf2trade](/r/tf2trade) too. I finally found this guy on sourceop and he was paying cash. I struck a deal with him to sell my unusual for $35. I went first after seeing his rep on his steam profile and some were left by people i have seen trading before and i know are trustable. After receiving the item, I gave him my paypal email for my payment, he claimed that he had sent it, but it never came. When i go to check and asks him to hold on, he says ok and never replies back, and eventually blocks me. 

TL:DR i went first

I was too frightened and afraid at that time, but here is some proof that i got

**[Common scams are listed here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/jhyte/common_trade_scams_and_how_to_avoid_them/)**

Misrepresentation Scams: If someone represents something one way and it turns out not to be that way, the buyer must reasonably inquire to find out what they are purchasing. If they do not, then it is not scamming if they did not get what they thought they were getting for failure to ask.

**Examples**

1. Bill says his hat is worth 4 refined. It is worth 2. Jim does not research the hat

2. Bill says his hat is craftable. The trade window does show whether or not a hat is craftable. There is no way to determine whether a hat is craftable or not other than the seller's word. Jim buys the hat and then finds out it is



***
To report anyone for scamming

1. ALL of the scammer's steam IDs as identified by [SteamRep](http://www.steamrep.com)

2. The victim's Steam ID

3. **Evidence in the form of screen shots or other trustworthy forms**

4. Witnesses

5. The items that were scammed

***Now onto the purpose of this raffle...***

I run 3 servers (trade, and it's my dream to see them grow popular and have lots of people play on them. From my previous efforts, I've managed to be able to see a little community grow, but I'd love to see it grow even more.

So what I'd like *YOU* to do is to check out my servers! Favourite them

Sometimes you'll join my servers and find them *empty*! But that's okay! You simply need to invite some friends, it'll be full!  
Running these servers is a **team effort**

My servers are run with a simple philosophy: **community**. I like to foster an environment where everyone can chill and have a good time, and have fun!

Would you like to help out? Join my [***new*** STEAM GROUP](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CTSCommunity) and read about how you can contribute to the CTS community!  
The reason this Steam group is new is because I felt the old name was, and getting bigger, and thus it needed a new name: The CTS Community.

Check out the CTS commmunity's [SEXY NEW WEBSITE](http://www.thectscommunity.com/) where you can read about the CTS, which serves the same purpose essentially. The CTS also uses [HLStatsX](http://www.thectscommunity.com/stats/hlstats.php) so you can keep track of your kills and stuff. Visit the page [here](http://www.thectscommunity.com/stats/hlstats.php) and type ""hlx"" in game to check out your ranking!

Also
It's a ghost town right now and boasts a total of 4 members (including me :c). There are sections for general discussion, and I'll do my best to make you feel welcome! I hope to be able to hold private CTS-exclusive raffles and contests there one day once it gets popular enough.

Or you can just **hop right in** and join any of my 3 servers! Simply click the IP to join if Steam is running!

/r/tf2trade is currently the fairest place to trade by far, and not everybody searches whenever they want something.  Outpost is ""I'll buy everything you have for half price"" spam, and tf2 metal market gets close, but it drives me crazy seeing people with the same buy/sell price listed, but without a transaction happening.  I would like to expedite the process by making the matching automatic, where you can click a little button and it will send you to a trade within a trivial amount of metal of your current price, and if you accept the price a friend request will be sent and the trade will continue.  Online players will take a priority over offline players.  You will still be able to browse new trades should you want to

___

**What I will use:**

So, middle-ground prices that don't result in a significant gain of wealth for one party or another.  No more buying all stranges for a scrap.  Fair market buyers and fair market sellers.

___


**How it's going to work:**

I'd like to have 2 sections, but it will most likely be a range based on backpack.tf's listed prices, which won't allow you to lowball if you are buying or highball if you are selling.  If you want to pay more/sell for cheap, I don't want to stop you.  The items are trickier, I'm thinking it would probably work like the metal trades, where the values of the items would have to be similar in order for a trade to be valid.  You would be allowed to wholesell/buy, however the profit margin would be fair.  Buying revolvers at .33 and selling at .66 is acceptable in my book

___
**What I need:** (WILL UPDATE)

* Somebody to help with the layout, etc.  My experience is limited, I need somebody who knows what's up.

* Community feedback.  If you guys don't want this

If you have web design experience and have ample free time (I have too much time on my hands, PM me or comment.  I would prefer if you are free between 8-12 PM MST (GMT - 7) weekdays, and within 3-4 hours of MST so that weekends can be made most useful.

With the help and valuable input of Heisenberg, which will be taking place this Saturday, with a grand prize for the winner... and his partner. 

""His partner?"" You ask. That's right! 

On **Saturday

###**The Event**


The rules are simple. 

There will be 14 players on each team. 7 snipers

The map will have a divide in the middle. Snipers cannot cross to the other side of the map

**The Sniper Loadout:**

Primary: The Huntsman  
Secondary: Jarate   
Melee: Kukri  


**The Spy Loadout:**

Primary: Revolver  
Secondary: Invis Watch  
Melee: Knife  


Each sniper will be partnered with a spy (so tell a friend about this event!)

There will be 3 ""pre-final"" rounds. The last sniper standing on both Red and Blu will win a prize (and his/her spy partner too) and will be allowed to enter the semi-final round. They must then sit out for the 2nd ""pre-final"" round while the process repeats

There are two semi-final rounds. 

In the first round, then we must have a Red team winning the second time). 

For the final round

**EDIT: CLARIFICATION OF SOME RULES. If your Spy partner dies, your Spy partner may continue playing until both of you are eliminated. No respawning allowed!**

And that's it for the rules!

-------------------------------------------------

###THE GRAND PRIZES ARE: For the champion Sniper

Sharking, a promo item, a rare vintage) something far less valuable. These people prey on low-hour players, freshly unboxed unusuals, and I hate to say it, but a lot of the times Redditors. 


To all those reading this, your unbox will appear to every shark within a day or so, and you will have a lot of friend requests. This is a hassle, but unfortunately it's bound to happen. Simply ignore them or say no thanks, because more often than not they're simply trying to scam you out of your hard-earned shiny purple hats!


I have myself been doing an investigation of a fellow named Anubis and/or Tangled, buds, bills, and unusuals with his own personal search engine. He has made thousands of dollars off of people just like us, people that were unaware of the true value of their items. This type of behavior has become widespread within the community, and it's up to us all to keep ourselves informed, and help out our fellow Redditors.

Here are the details.

I traded him a Peace Napper's Respite for money.

He traded the napper's to someone else and got scammed.

He says that scammer was me

He wants me to give him money or else I'll be reported and that he has lots of proof to show I scammed him.

Source:

*  http://forums.sourceop.com/forums/32-TF2-Item-Buying-Selling. Just look; the cheapest on the front page is currently $1.69. People are buying in bulk at $1.4
* Buds have gone from $34-$40+ whilst *decreasing* in key value (27/28-24/25).  

As someone who enjoys being a market spectator and speculator

Stuff I know can't be right (at least not without further justification)  

* Events. Nothing is going on right now to lower key supply.  
* Inflation. Keys are rising in metal at the same rate as when they were $1.25-$1.3 each. Plus this is a recent thing. They surged 30 cents in 3 days.  
* Supply. We're still at 487k keys in the game. (Source: http://stats.tf/item/5021/Mann_Co._Supply_Crate_Key). I believe this isn't far off the 500k figure given in a separate discussion about inflation a month ago. **However**

If you buy a hi five taunt, banned from steamrep servers, etc. you weren't going to craft that hi five taunt of schaudenfraude or team captain anyways, were you? im not saying that you would be in the wrong and it was okay. In fact, i understand why you were angry even.

but come on, then you dont have to do the trade and its all good! but if they tell you it is not store bought, and it turns out to be, THEN is the time to take action. 

now so the people who did get affected by this sort of transaaction

* Store bought weapons. nobody wants a store bought weapon

* Craft hats. this is where i see it go rampant

* there should be nothing wrong with selling uncraftable more ""rare"" items such as taunts of TC etc because in reality NOBODY is going to craft those. the shaudenfraude

1315978294.0,kf2nc,Trading tips I've learned over two weeks of rigorous trading. People new to trading please read. Experienced traders may learn a thing or two.,free_tf2_stuff,38,2,33,"This started out as a reply to a comment

1) Use this site for most of your trades. http://tf2spreadsheet.blogspot.com/. You have to be careful though because this site doesn't account for demand of an item

2) Post stuff you want to sell on this subreddit along with the steam forums for tf2 trading. More potential customers never hurts. The worst that can happen is you telling them you don't have it anymore.

3) In trade servers, engages a trade with you, and then offers you 2 refined metal. You know that is the lowest amount you can possibly get from him. You can probably ask for 2.33 and he will accept. Now, take a step back and think about what would happen if YOU had advertised ""strange grenade launcher 2 ref"", then that's the max amount you can get. He may offer you 1.66 ref and then you would be forced to settle at 1.8. This is actually something I learned from my uncle who negotiates real estate properties for millions of dollars, it makes perfect sense!

4) Again, if no one is biting go on to the next. You will reach the most potential buyers this way. In addition, be on the look out for good deals when doing this. 

5) When buying, maybe not even 2 ref. BUT, in some transactions you may be able to give the opposite trader it valued at 2 ref. And you never know, maybe the trader will actually use that item!

6) Last but not least, because you have a lot of experienced people trading on both. I know its obvious but learn the path to trading with someone on the same server as you. As a corollary, I don't know how many times I've seen a good deal only to open up the current server list and not remember the seller's name. Make sure you remember it even if you have to repeat it to yourself every trade you make. 

Happy Trading Everyone

1354891080.0,14g0z6,[PSA] Introducing The TF2 Economy Project,agg23,44,13,96,"Many of you might have seen the previous discussions held on /r/TF2Trade about having an official, The TF2 Economy Project!

----

**Project Vision:**

To provide the TF2 trading community with a fair, such as Backpack.tf, and present that pricing data to the user.  The TF2 Economy team is dedicated to providing a fair system that we can use ourselves, in light of the main TF2 Spreadsheet conspiracy.  Our system is built from the ground up to be efficient, fast, and secure, without being prone to price manipulation

The system runs on elected trade officials having votes, although I do have access to this database (which I need as the web dev :P ).  This eliminates many of the issues seen on Backpack.tf and the TF2 Spreadsheet.  Any addition ideas to combat price fraud will be considered.

As for the current design, I know the front end is fairly bad.  As a front end web developer myself, I've spent most of my time working on the APIs and back end to make TF2 Economy work.  I do have graphics people working on a design, but feel free to submit one of your own if you feel the need.  I'm sure they would love to have additional input.

This system is planned to be the official pricing guide to /r/TF2Trade

----

**Leadership:**

The leadership of the TF2 Economy project is being divided between several key figures

&gt;MLGM - Head of Graphics
 &gt;&gt;VideoVideo - Graphics Support

&gt;Qwix and ME Chihuahua [MCT] - Project Support

&gt;macropower - Head Pricer

&gt;agg23 - Project Lead and Head Developer
&gt;&gt;Ponco - Domain Owner and Development Support

Additional members will be added/removed as necessary.

----

**Pricers:**

What we now need from the community are members who are willing to start using the system.  People who have a high trading reputation, but as far as I can tell it should be usable.  Additional features will be added as time goes on.

1339030412.0,uoyeb,[PSA]New Team Fortress 2 Trading and Pricing Site,aguywithathing,37,4,32,"I've been playing TF2 and TFC now for a number of years and the TF2 item community took my interest. I've noticed quite a few pricing guides around the web, but it would be pointless to simply ask another trading site for a copy of their data without being laughed at. So along with the pricing data I needed an accompanying trading site which is what I have done. This isn't a money grabbing exercise
Here is a sample page of the pricing guide http://www.tf2trader.net/items/item/id/40 ( this is a very early concept and I need to factor in other currencies to it yet ).
The site can be found at http://www.tf2trader.net

I used to do a lot of trading in tf2 but just before Christmas i gave all my stuff away on /r/tf2. I have since been working on this app which lets you track your trades


The app is in early alpha (mainly because i kill the server by accident once a day) but the main functionality is there and it is already quite useful.


Here is a link to the website [tf2bank](http://tf2bank.com). You dont have to do anything else but sign up (we use steam openid so you dont have to give us your username or password only an email address). The app does the rest and you can go review your trades at anytime.

Here is my [trades page](http://tf2bank.com/monitor/trades/?id=76561198044442098)

Im releasing this exclusively on reddit for now and depending on the reception i might have to limit numbers because im not sure what the server can handle. 

Any questions or feedback please let me know

Cheers thorhat - i dont get any karma if you upvote

Many items require a nice chunk of metal + weapons to craft. For example

* Now

Sounds simple, losing 8 in the process. With those 8 scrap, you could've gotten 7-8 more weapons, saved them to be turned into reclaimed for trading, or whatever else you want!

So Windows 8 comes out today/tomorrow, so I decided to make a TF2 item app to learn about development.

For this application, applicable classes, slot, etc, which you could all search for.

On the search page itself [you can sort by slot type](http://i.imgur.com/7E3FQh.png). To make things simpler I grouped all the extra things (from sappers to medals) in the ""other"" category.

The item page itself [pulls images from the item schema

It also currently [pulls pricing data from backpack.tf, but that'll be a bit more difficult since they don't provide an API for trades, so I'll have to scrape data from their actual webpages (if they give me permission of course).

Clicking on the reddit posts [brings you to the relevant page of course](http://i.imgur.com/8OzVIh.png). In the future, a convenience.

Here are some other things I'm planning on doing:

* Front page will show list of most recent items looked at
* The ability to set notifications for prices - the app'll poll backpack.tf once a day or so for the prices of your watched items, either in the form of a toast notification (think the growl popups in Mac OSX if you're not familiar with Win8) or updates to the tile of the application
* Third column on the main page
* Some sort of integration with a TF2 item stats website
* Some sort of user backpack integration. I know the API for accessing backpack data

[](/ajsup) So what do you guys think? Any missing features immediately jump out at you? The UI making your eyes bleed? I really would love some suggestions before I decide that this is ""finished"". Whether or not you ever use the app or not (it'll be free if you do!), because this is definitely a learning experience for me. Thanks in advance!

- For a low-craft item or hat (#1-100), be patient, and see what all comes your way.  It's difficult to put a price on any craft # item, let alone brand new ones.

- For the normal/strange, tf2outpost, etc. and get a fairly good estimate of what they'll sell for by simply looking at offers and what others have sold/purchased them for.  Just note that the price will likely fall over the next few days/week when the interest starts to die down.

[A lot of you probably remember and participated in this thread during the November sales.](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/mr4vx/h_7495_in_my_steam_account_w_to_buy_you_games_for/) I will once again be doing this for the Reddit community. It will be somewhere between $200 - $300 this time around (last time was $250). For those of you not familiar

However, you can make sure you have the items you need available when this goes live. The pricing will be as follows:

* Reclaimed Metal = $.20

* Refined Metal = $.60

* Keys = $1.60

* Bill's Hat = $11

* Buds = $25

While I had to unfortunately change the prices

Ex: $200 would get me 8 Buds at $25 each. If I am paid via this in all refined metal it works out as follows. 

$200/.60 = 333.33 Refined

If I could manage to get every key at 2.5

With Buds at 17 Keys each

With the above example

Mark your calenders though

An Example:

Player A is selling a Saxton's Own [Strange] that is gifted to anyone willing to pay ""X"" amount of currency.

1351393259.0,127bse,[PSA] I made a guide for this years drop system. (Xpost /r/tf2),Cyphafrost,34,4,24,"Hello! I am 95% sure I have this year's present drop system figured out

For starters, whether they be spectating or in the process of joining and loading the map.This means that once every five minutes after the start of the round or 5 minutes the last gift is picked up, a new one will spawn. NOT 5 minutes after the last gift spawned. This means if the recipient of the last gift take three minutes to find the gift, the next gift will have an interval of 8 minutes before the previous.
Now, with even odds for each player. In a 32 person server with 32 in it, you will have a 1/32 chance. Now, in a 12 man server, you have a 1/12 chance to have the gift be yours.

Now, with even odds for each player. In a 32 person server with 32 in it, you will have a 1/32 chance. Now, in a 12 man server, you have a 1/12 chance to have the gift be yours

For perfect gift dropping chances, so a constant 1/10 chance. Gifts will have less of an interval if the gift is picked up faster, so the person with the gift should say in chat ""Gift, truce"" so the gift gets to other people faster, minimizing time.

Idle accounts can be utilized if you A) Run two instances of TF2 at a time or B) Use a spare computer. This would give you a 1/5 chance
TO find a server with a small amount of people limit

Now, with truces and cooperation. Insta respawn time is good, and when you pick up the gift, you won't get the item found screen. If you refresh your backpack by dying and clicking ""Organize Backpack"", the item will appear in your backpack, but you will have to manually scan for it if you want to know what it was.

With an insta respawn with 10 people with 2 accounts and fast pickups
In a 32 man server with 1 account and low cooperation
This works on all the gift dropping maps.

On the new map, they won't be there (based on my experience).
Also, son't get mad at me. It's based off of my experience, so some things might be different for you.

TL;DR Find a server with low max players

Edit: 1 Gift drop per team? Seems to make sense

And his banned [outpost profile](http://www.tf2outpost.com/user/180913) (his bp has gone private)

Also don't buy the hats he has scammed as it will get you marked on Steamrep for trading with scammers. He will be offloading it soon so report any instance of him selling it.

1328776270.0,phlh0,[Tool] Greasemonkey/Userscripts to make trading life easier,hypersniper,38,7,25,"Hello fellow traders

I have recently concocted what I believe to be quite a useful little tool for frequenters of steamcommunity profiles like ourselves.

It adds and modifies the ""Actions"" section on a steamcommunity profile page to make it more convenient for power users.

Features:

* Adds handy ""View Backpack on TF2B"" and ""View SteamRep Profile"" links.
* Adds an ""Edit Notes"" section
* Adds a basic link containing the Steam ID of the user
* Makes ""Add to my Friends List"" use a steam:// protocol link

If you have basic programming knowledge it's also quite simple to customise to your own liking and add your own links. Just edit the userscript and take a look towards the bottom. **Edit:** A quick general editing tutorial [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/phlh0/tool_greasemonkeyuserscripts_to_make_trading_life/c3plhc4)

I've personally found this useful and I hope you guys do as well. If you use Firefox, and Chrome users can install it without the need for any extensions.

[Screenshot here](http://imgur.com/qy6C2)

[DOWNLOAD/INSTALL HERE!](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/125279)

Other Greasemonkey scripts that you may find useful: 

* [Add SteamRep to Steam Community profiles](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/124931) by Mattie! - Adds SteamRep and TF2Items as frames at the bottom of a steamcommunity page.

* [tf2items tweak + Unusuals](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/119856) by Mattie! - makes unusuals and earbuds more noticable on TF2Items.

Current offer 300$ by http://steamcommunity.com/id/sripakdp

Hello all

Let me introduce myself, feel free to google it. 

So story goes like this: Yay it's Christmas time. Ooooh, I got a hat... aww sucky, it doesn't look very cool. Oh well,  my very first unusual! 

I get lots of random friend invites over the next few days asking to trade for the hat and become suspicious. Eventually I look up the hat and find it is considered very wanted. Cool... Then I am told its apx value in cash is up to 500-600$! Like... holy $#!+. 

Now to the situation I am in that would have me trade away my first and only unusual hat. Simply put, now feels like the right time to take the next step. And with the sale of this item, I can propose with a ring suitable to the woman who will be wearing it. (here is a pic of us on a date to Seattle: https://d.facdn.net/art/orion/1305871886.orion_sketchy.jpg )

To me

The 600$ is what I was told was the value

If anyone is interested in the trade

I thank you for reading this. And to whoever does end up purchasing the hat

Feel free to add me but if you want to post here and ask for weapons please make sure you leave a link to your profile or tell me your display name if you say you've added me.  I have no other way of making sure the right people get the right weapons.

1351740828.0,12futp,[PSA] What to do after unboxing your first (Halloween) Unusual,nightfly13,44,15,14,"I've been posting this advice in several threads

So first you need to ascertain the reasonable market value range of your new unusual. To do this

Harvest Moon + It's a Secret to Everbody is approximately equal to Cloudy Moon of the same hat. Those prices should be fairly established (check backpack.tf/unusuals and google 'pc moon XXX' for some idea of the range).

The other effects are probably worth a bit less

So let's hypothesize that your new hat is worth 10 buds based on the above. I'd want to move it into a more-stable situation asap. That means trade it for buds or for an established-value hat.

So with that 10 bud unusual you just unboxed, but ultimately you really want to get that halloween hat (which could have a second or third unboxed at any moment and the market on those effects could crash) as soon as possible.

Now that you've got buds or a slightly-more-valuable established-price hat, or you want to get the cash out, or a combination of the two.

If you do want to convert some or all of the value back out into cash

I'd also make sure their SOP rep thread is at least 2-3 months old so you're not at great risk of a chargeback scam.

Hope that's helpful!",,t5_2s0s4,False,,default,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/12futp/psa_what_to_do_after_unboxing_your_first/

**Backpack buying**

Sick of TF2? Need monies?

I am buying entire backpacks for Paypal/Steam wallet. I have $500+ to work with. My ideal limit is around the $200 per pack

I can buy everything

You do not get full price (needs to be clear); I take a cut but you save the time of selling everything and selling that stuff for paypal. That can be an awful lot of saving. I know I've spent &gt;$1000+ on backpacks.

---

Leave a note here/PM/add me if you're interested. Leaving at least a guideline price ($10 or $200 or whatever) will help me save time and help us work out a deal.

Note I do not treat promos or unusuals or # numbers or other difficult to sell/price items at market price; everything is hand valued and then I subtract a small percentage.

Hi everyone.

I am the_surgeon

~~The main reason for making this thread is that I am looking for help.  A lot of you have probably realised the armory has not been online as much as it should be

Because the friends list is becoming very full I will also ask that if you are in the armory friends list but not actively looking to trade at the moment please remove us so we can free up space.  You are welcome to join the [armory steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditarmory) to keep in touch with us.

The new players armory has been restored in all its former glory.  It is technically a different account now but it is linked from the group page and anyone who is new and looking for help getting started is welcome to come and say hello.

I don't have admin access on the group page or new players armory so I will comment there with this information.

Finally

Thank you very much for reading and thank you to everyone who has already helped support the armory.

In only a few months of trading I was never offered cash that I didn't request. When I asked for hat offers I got hat offers.

**In just the last week I have been Friended approximately a dozen times by people offering me cash for my hat.**

If it isn't already your policy to Decline those then consider it - it is rude unless you specifically ask for it anyways. If you are looking for cash or will entertain cash offers then be 10x wary. You pick the middleman. You open the dialogues. You double-check and screen cap everything.

Im now for around 15 hours the proud owner of an unusuals and i was asking for offers on tf2tp. Then a guy said this: http://tinypic.com/r/20rjts3/5 (print screen )

The link isnt to somewhere what he said. its to a crappy site and the site wants to install a progam on your pc. so i immediately clicked the site away.

So im curious. is he trying to scam me and so yes how do i report him?

Initially, I got a friend request by a person called 'Dannyz' (http://steamcommunity.com/id/dannyjaya/) who says that they are from tf2outpost.com and were after my keys.

After a lengthy discussion on reputation

After a bit more discussion on the method of transfer, send him the keys, and then poor grammar and (hilariously bad) excuses ensue.  

*****

Dannyz: i have friend working at paypal dont worry

Dannyz: i can call him in-phone now

*****

drfunbuster +M: Paypal is instant my friend.

Dannyz: yes its 100% true

Dannyz: wired with you =/

Dannyz: i guess your balance is $0 the problem

drfunbuster +M: No

Dannyz: paypal will let any transaction pass if at leat there $1.95 balance

Dannyz: $1.95 is ""safe condition""

*****

Now to the thing that completely fucked me over. His reputation. First off

**""Fuck""**

They're all from Indonesia. 

(*to clarify, it most likely means that they are either his own accounts or his friends*)

*****

Moral of the story: Do some god damn research on the people on their profile

It's the seller's responsibility to research the value of their item. Think about selling a car, you are only hurting yourself to not learn the value and get the proper payment (virtual item or real world cash). 

Smart buyers will shop around and try and find the best deals. It may be thought of as ""ripping off"" a misinformed seller

We think of ourselves as redditors as slightly more honest and ""good"" people than the rest of the Internet, who are willing to be honest and lend a hand to the less knowledgeable new guys. 

Just don't expect everyone to show you the same courtesy.

Cheers for entering guys, offered me to back out. 

That said, were left behind. While this is a bit of a bummer, I have been thinking a bit about what I can do with them now. 

As those of you who read the post know, I think I would still like to keep trading, just not in unusuals. I believe this is the best decision for me, as I'm currently doing year 12 (final year of school in Australia) and this way I can spend less time focusing on this, and more on filling other life commitments. 

So expect me to return, but rest assured when I do, it will be worth it. And next time, the raffle will be up until someone wins it. No time limit.

SO

Here are the few things you should keep in mind.

* Do NOT add me if you're rich and able enough to be giving away items yourself. Because you should be just doing that rather than asking for some. :)

* People posting something cheerful or why I should giveaway some stuff to them might get some better items.

* New players of TF2 should definitely add me.

* Please do not be **greedy**. The item can be worth anywhere between a rec to a few keys. It'll entirely be upto be. DO NOT demand me anything.

Now

I'll be giving away items until nothing I don't want remains on my backpack. So

Anywho

According to TF2 Spreadsheet

I don't want to give them away for nothing

----------------------------------------------------------------

Option 1: **Refined!**

You read it correctly. Refined is the life blood of TF2 trading! So simply, a scrap, and a TF2 limerick.**

Because who doesn't love a good limerick?


-----------------------------------------------------

Option 2: **Keys!**

Let me be honest with you. I have almost a page full of crates. The only thing I'll be using these keys for is opening those puppies up. If I don't get any

1 Key per Ticket.

----------------------------------------------------------

Option 3: **HATS**

I need hats. They keep me sane. So if you have a craftable hat

Please. Help a brothah out.

--------------------------------------

Option 4: My Special Wants

These are for people who actually have the specific items

**Genuine Original: 4 Tickets**

**Genuine Righteous Bison: 5 Tickets**

**Sneaky Spats of Sneaking: 3 Tickets**

**Genuine Half-Zitoichi: 2 Tickets**

------------------------------------------------------------

That's it! **Max 2 Tickets Per Person

Message me here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/nixon_smash

I will happily trade you

Thanks!

1342116538.0,wgc55,[Q] What do you consider good trade etiquette?,Boozhau,29,1,66,"Hello fellow traders. Just a question of what you view as a good example of trade etiquette.

A bit of input from me:

- I hate when I get trade requests and the other person puts up a random item and says ""Offer"". I didn't ask to trade with you!

- Patience.

The total list:

- Changing the price when the window is open

- Opening a trade before saying a single word after friend invites are accepted. This more applies to approaching mass sellers...they might not have your item anymore. Just ask. Say hi! Anything!

- Responding to a post that asks for metal, some people don't want to have to sell more stuff!

- Don't ask for a rep post on a normal freaking trade. Its just a bunch of fluff if you do that...trades have no inherent risk if its all in-game.

~El Mangosto

- Be polite

- Be fair

- Be understanding

~bigfrenak

- I hate when I get trade requests and the other person puts up a random item and says ""Offer"". I didn't ask to trade with you!

- Patience.

~Boozhau

I hate when I get trade requests and the other person puts up a random item and says ""Offer"". I didn't ask to trade with you!

That's a good one.

And on a related note, and they mock me for ""highballing"" them. Grinds my gears.

Also:

- Asking for +rep after a simple trade. Completely reasonable to ask for +rep if you've just made a cash trade or an unusual trade

- Adding people just to offer a price lower than the asking price. That's why trading sites have messaging systems in place.

- After adding someone, then trade.

Accept a trade request you have shown interest in

Don't ask for a player to 'tell you what they have' when they say they are trading weapons for scrap.  Ask for what you want.

Nobody cares you got a strange sniper from your brother for 1 scrap

If someone has a shop

If someone's selling something for a scrap

When you accept the invitation you should shoot them a message over steam. This lets them know that you've accepted their friend request. Otherwise they wouldn't know that you've accepted unless they're ocd and check their friends tab constantly.

Next

After the trade is confirmed/agreed upon

Make the trade. This is the easy

Thank the person afterwards for the trade. It never hurts to be courteous. (Hint: People generally like it better when you aren't a total asshole towards them)

[Optional] Remove them from your friends list after the trade is complete and you both bid each other farewell.

Don't spam the same trade. Honestly, after awhile you gotta think they're uninterested.

1312829793.0,jco32,I'm selling nothing at all. Fireside chat inside :),RSZC,42,11,24,"Hey folks

I just today managed to get the [hat I always wanted](http://i.imgur.com/woORj.jpg). To begin with, I would ask them before the trade concluded where they found my name. I could **always tell** beforehand if they were from reddit, because these trades were always infinitely more courteous and pleasant. With your folks help, over the course of about 3 weeks I went from having two tradeable hats and no knowledge whatsoever to my very own, probably-should-be-painted-a-slightly-less-obnoxious-color Max's. So, in order to give back just a tad bit, I offer this thread filled with what little I know about trading to help the next person who wants to trade up.

**1) Fuck Vintage Hats**

Vintage hats are worth more than normal hats. This is true. But

Here's the thing with vintage hats. Everybody wants a good vintage hat. If you have a vintage hat that's the best in the class, and the only thing better than a Kabuto is a hipster Kabuto that says ""my Kabuto is better than yours."" Enter vintage. But does anybody really want to wear that vintage old guadalajara? No, because it's ugly as shit. So who are the possible buyers for an v. old guadalajara [edit: whoops!]? 

- bargain hunters: you won't get much from these guys
- vintage collectors: people who are hunting for literally every single vintage hat for a specific class or just
- some weirdo who actually likes that hat! (I kid

The fact of the matter is that with the exception of the true high-value vintage hats, or you have to sell it so cheaply that somebody will buy it in hopes of flipping it for more. If you are offered a deal on a vintage, subtract a reclaimed or so from the ""market value"" and imagine that you'll have to sell it that cheaply. If you're not willing to be patient, you probably will.

Well

**2) Fuck buying low

Don't do that. Buy ridiculously low, but you can't get it sold there either, because a thousand other traders are also selling their Kabuto for 2ref. It's a buyer's market. If somebody wants to pick a Kabuto, they choose a seller at random, and the odds they pick you aren't good. Now, in the meantime, while you were trying in vain to sell this Kabuto for 2ref, bought a craftable hat for a ref, run searches everywhere you can think of to see who is looking for it. Very frequently you can find either a 1.33 hat that's more in demand (meaning you can sell it faster) or somebody who's willing to trade a more expensive hat for it. Take these offers. A normal trade path goes something like: buy really shitty hat for cheap (1ref). Trade this hat a couple times until you've got a pretty decent hat that you can sell immediately for 1.66ref. Rinse

**3) Fuck scrapbanking and weapon selling**

Yes, scrap a couple of em down and fuel future scrapbanking operations. It all sounds nice, but there's one gaping and horrendously irritating flaw: in order to make any decent sort of profit by doing this, you need to be incredibly committed. You need to be posting on reddit all the time, spamming TF2TP, and spamming trade servers constantly. What's more, you actually need to READ all the stuff people are saying in trade servers

Is that really how you want to spend a few hours at a time, and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody else either.

**4) Keep a bit

When a great deal comes by, five 2ref hats, and a 1.33ref hat all for a Bills. Clearly, this was a good deal, as you can, if you're patient, find a Bills for as little as 4 keys. If I hadn't had a Bills in my backpack at the time, I would have missed out on that easy profit opportunity. Keep a little bit of all types of currency in your backpack at all times, bills, you want to go out and buy 20 craft hats that you can then sell. Make your money work for you.

**The Good Stuff: Finding the Great Deals**

All of the above stuff I've said is all well and dandy. This place is not the best place to find profit, nor is this, nor is that. But people who have managed to read through all of the above will note that I haven't really given a great strategy! The advice of ""buy super low"" and ""don't populate trade servers as they are soul sucking havens of despair"" don't seem to go together. Where, exactly, does one find these great deals? How can you spend all of your built up refined metal into cheap hats which you can then trade? 

Automation. To begin with, perhaps once every minute. At that point in time, you're then free to go into trade servers while you read a book, eat breakfast, watch TV or a movie, and you only need to look up or pay attention when somebody trades you. This is a fantastic way to handle trade servers. Although you will probably miss out on the occasional deal that passes by (especially the cheap weapons deals), in my mind it more than makes up for that by relieving you of the tremendous tedium.

Well, but what about more expensive things? What if I want to find keys for only 2 refined, or bills for only 4 keys, or buds for only 2 unpainted bills? How would I go about that?

It's very good of you to keep asking these relevant questions. The answer, a [little script I whipped up](https://pastee.org/2e6za). The password is r/tf2trade. This perl script is a web scraper for TF2TP. It automatically refreshes and reads the recent page of TF2TP every 45 seconds, which is about enough so that you don't ever miss a single trade. Tell it what you're looking for and what currency you're looking to pay, and your browser will open up every new trade that meets those requirements. It's not very well written; I'm no CS major and I had never written anything in Perl before this. However, despite the miserable programming style, it's (as you can see) very easy to modify. If I learned how to program this in under a day, you can figure out how to modify this in just a few minutes, immediately, and a more accurate wishlist parser (to stop you from seeing things such as trades offering keys for 2.33 when you're just looking for 2). None of these things would be prohibitively complex to implement

Enjoy the profit. Enjoy getting the items you're looking for while expending the minimal amount of effort possible. Enjoy spending your TF2 time actually playing TF2. 

Good luck :)",,t5_2s0s4,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/jco32/im_selling_nothing_at_all_fireside_chat_inside/
1310838825.0,irely,"Rules regarding ""Stores"" or ""Shops""",lawlyer,34,5,21,"**Chances are this post does not apply to you if you are a casual trader.**

We have seen a rise in people opening ""stores"" or ""shops"" where they offer a large amount of items. Sometimes these stores ask users to make private offers that are either accepted or rejected.

Well, these stores operate mostly for profit and work this way: you make an offer and the ""shop keeper"" looks at your back pack, gauges your interest, and attempts to make you over-pay. That isn't cool. Therefore, we have decided that the following rules will apply to any ""store"".



All of the following criteria are required to be classified as a ""store"":

* Selling more than five items

*  Only trading for ""keys""

* Have a somewhat re-occuring thread submission selling the same or substantially similar items.




If the above are *substantially* met

* You must list all items for sale within your thread. You *may* list your backpack

* You must allow offers in the thread. However

* You must clearly state that you are a ""shop"" or ""store"".

* Stores must list the prices of each item or prices for items in a category.

**Failure to follow these rules will result in your post being removed.** ",,t5_2s0s4,True,,trusted hat,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/irely/rules_regarding_stores_or_shops/
1374979435.0,1j72nu,[PSA] Cash trading guide: Bitcoin,Doctor_McKay,37,7,9,"[Bitcoin](http://www.bitcoin.org) is a good way to transfer money online. However

Bitcoin is not a payment processor. Bitcoin is a currency, and Bitcoins are not US Dollars. When you transfer Bitcoins, you're not transferring USD or any other fiat currency, you're transferring Bitcoins.

### What are the advantages?

When compared to PayPal

- Decentralized: Nobody can freeze your account (like PayPal is so [prone to doing](http://www.paypalsucks.com)). And since it's decentralized

- Lower fees: PayPal charges a fee of 2.9% + $0.30 for international transfers. Bitcoin's fees are much lower

- **No chargebacks!** This is by far the largest advantage. When trading TF2 items via PayPal

### What are the disadvantages?

There are only a couple of disadvantages:

- Slightly slower: You don't truly *have* the money for about an hour.

- Slightly higher barrier to entry: If you want to convert fiat to Bitcoin

- You're responsible for your money: If you have money in PayPal, if you somehow lose access to your wallet (computer crashes, you forget a password, etc.), your money is **gone**.

### What is one Bitcoin worth?

A good Bitcoin conversion rate is located [here](http://www.preev.com/).

### How does it work?

There's a good video at [weusecoins.com](http://www.weusecoins.com).

### So how do I trade TF2 items for Bitcoin?

To get started, but if you forget your password, all of your money is gone forever.

Once you sign up, we'll stick with the one.

In order to get Bitcoins into your wallet

### Getting Paid

Once you're ready to sell an item and you know how much BTC you want to get paid, nobody in the network has picked it up yet and declared that ""This is a valid transaction."" While a transaction is unconfirmed, there is a very small chance that the buyer will be able to ""double-spend"" the money, preventing you from getting it. This is a guide of how many confirmations you should wait for before considering the money ""yours"":

| Transaction Volume (USD Equivalent) | Confirmations |
|-------------------------------------|--------------|
| &lt; $10                                           | 0 - 1            |
| $10 - $25                                      | 1 - 2            |
| $50 - $75                                      | 3 - 4            |
| $75 - $100                                     | 4 - 5           |
| $100 - $150                                   | 5 - 6            |
| &gt; $150                                          | 6                 |

^^I ^^just ^^made ^^these ^^numbers ^^up

The more confirmations a transaction has, so waiting for the full 6 confirmations will take about an hour. If a trader has large amounts of reputation, it's reasonably safe to accept lower numbers of confirmations.

When sending coins, of course). The fee is entirely voluntary, but highly recommended. The amount of the fee is determined by the buyer. **The higher the fee, the quicker the transaction is confirmed.** The recommended fee is 0.0005 - 0.001 BTC (currently $0.05 - $0.10). For a larger transaction, you should generally pay a higher fee (but it will always be cheaper than PayPal!).

### Converting to Fiat

You can convert your Bitcoins to fiat currency (traditional money) at a Bitcoin exchange. See the last paragraph of the ""So how do I trade TF2 items for Bitcoin?"" section.

### Staying Safe

PayPal is safer on the buyer's side, it's possible to make it safer for both sides. Standard cash trading rules apply. Those with more reputation should generally go first in a transaction. Middlemen are also highly recommended for high-volume transactions. With PayPal, the buyer has the dispute system to fall back on if they don't receive the items. This is not true with Bitcoin, so make sure that you're trading with someone who's very reputable.

Bitcoin addresses are entirely anonymous. There's no ""verified"" status like PayPal has. Ensure that the person you're trading with is trustworthy. Look for the traditional signs of a scammer: fresh Steam account, no reputation, private backpack. These are all signs that you may be dealing with a scammer's alt. You may also wish to take into consideration the user's Steam Level. A user with a higher Steam Level has invested more into their Steam account and is therefore less likely to risk it by conducting a scam.

The NBS minecraft trade server is the sort of trade server made exclusively for sharking new players of their stuff. The rules include providing sanctions against linking or discussing any outside websites (including the spreadsheet to give new players the ballpark values they need to start trading)

Just over two months ago I was banned from their server for posting links (which I apologized for) and commenting on trades (commenting wasn't against the rules then!). Basically, I headed back to the server to trade. I was banned again with the reason listed as the exact same as the previous ban without doing anything to provoke such action. Even if this is just my side of the story, there shouldn't have been a second ban if I had served my original 2 months.

The NBS server is clearly an authoritarian community where new players go to have their valuables removed from them and the owner

It frustrates me to no end when someone posts ""[H] metal [W] item."" 95% of the time it's because the buyer has a sub par offer and doesn't want to scare off sellers.

That is why I ~~request~~ **demand** a giant flashing neon sign pop up thing with rule number 6 on it and maybe Billy Mays shouting at you.. May those who still refuse to follow the rule be cursed to unboxing endless strange Boston bashers and razorbacks.

Rule 6

&gt; Your post must list at least something you will consider for a trade.

A few weeks back I got it into my head that I wanted an unusual for my medic. Simple enough, don't uncrate for unusuals. I sell the stranges for cheap, take the metal, and eventually convert it into buds. 

So, I'll use this singular bud to buy a logo or fetti medic hat. Something low end, one of the 'shit tier' hats. This was my first warning flag that unusual traders might just be ponces. No matter how hard I looked, I was 'lowballing'. These are highly undesired unusuals that I coulda sworn were marked for $30 roughly, so a bud shouldn't have been that low of an offer.

A little peeved

The first thing that I noticed is that once you get an unusual

And then came the rip-off artists and scammers.

The scammers would urgently demand you pop open paypal so they could overpay for your unusual. Sometimes

The rip-off artists are the worst. Scammers are dime a dozen scumbags, maybe a bills if you're lucky). These fellas then turn around and sell the hat for what it's worth.

But you all surely know these things. No

Unusual traders have absolutely no clue what their hats are worth.

I noticed that most unusuals have no basis for their price, you just have to take my word for it"". There are people who horde massive amounts of unusuals so they can horde massive amounts of buds so they can...do...something. I dunno, I'm still kinda fuzzy on what the purpose of this all is. If it's cash, when will they finally cash out?

There's no real rhyme or reason to the value of unusuals, bloated costs of unusuals even further. And while we're on this, is hearts medic actually valuable or not? I've had multiple hearts medic offers on what I *thought* were low-mid tier medic hats, at least low-mid tier according to the unusual trade community, which may or may not be as reliable as throwing a dart at a price chart.

Anyway, and once I have my hands on the hat (it could be this one, or it could be that they reject my offer and I keep looking and find 'the hat') I plan to -never- touch unusuals again.

My advice, and all I've gotten from it is a headache and a sour taste in my mouth.

Anyone wanna share their experiences? Discuss? I'd love to hear what the community thinks.",,t5_2s0s4,False,,default,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/n52u0/unusual_traders_observations/

I get a friend invite from Captain Crab Man: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198050816434/

He says he has some money in his pay pal and he is interested in buying my p.energy Grimme Hatte. I check his profile and he has 23 hours played and only 14 items in his backpack. I ask him about it and he says he is on his brothers account, we will do it"" and then said for the hassle of me opening up a paypal account, he can overpay a little if I want. Which I thought was odd... Anyways, he says he knows a good middleman. and gives me the steamrep thread for an admin at UTC named Cloudy. I tell him I will set up a pay pal account and to hold on...

This is when I go to UTC and search through their admin for someone online. Their Head Forum Admin J.Jonah Jameson was online and when I explained what was happening

so I tell the scammer Im ready to go. I get into their trade. I tell them that I want a friend to join just to make sure everything seems legit. I invite the Admin (who has changed his name as to not send them running). We have a good laugh how the other two guys pretend to send their money to each other, and a negative mark on their steamrep. They act like its no big deal and and tells him the next time they do this they will impersonate him.

We are recruiting Junior Admins to help and operate the second account. Applicants from different time zones would be great!

Requirements: Minimum of 300 hours on tf2

Responsibilities: Operate the Armory and maintain a basic idea of inventory. Smelting of certain weapons and trading for shortage weapons. 

To apply please leave your steam profile below. Rolmos and I will hold a small interview for selected candidates. 

Armory Usage Guidelines:
The Armory is a non for profit organization run by volunteers
The Armory is primarily meant for newer players (Players with less than 150 hours on TF2). 

As a new player you are allowed to pick 2 weapons from the Armory free of charge. 

Experienced Players may use the Armory for some 1:1 trades for weapons that are not shortage weapons. 

Each trade will only contain a maximum of 1 Shortage weapon. 

Any weapon with a stock of 4 or less is considered to be on Shortage.  Any weapon that the operating admin deems to be on shortage is considered a shortage weapon. (We might have 6 cow manglers

We do not trade vintage/strange weapons or hats/paints/metal. The Armory reserves those as rewards for donation of shortage weapons. 

There is often a queue for trading the Armory

The on-duty admin of the Armory reserves the right to refuse any trade that they are uncomfortable with. 

Once you have finished getting your weapon

Trading the Armory:

1.	Join this [group]( http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditarmory)
2.	Check the inventory of the Armory by clicking on the links in the group and see the availability of weapons you want and make appropriate adjustments so that your request would only involve one shortage weapon.
3.	Add the group admins named Reddit Armory / Reddit Armory 2 as friends
4.	Wait until your friend invite is accepted
5.	Type out your request
6.	Wait for the Admin to give you the heads up to initiate trade either in game or trade beta
7.	Do the trade

1361581308.0,191zrp,[PSA] New Unusual Server from PyroProtectMe!!,-Josh,32,4,21,"Hello everyone!

Over the past couple of months it has become apparent that despite having multiple unusual trading servers, PinkTaco and WantedGov (amongst several more) there is still a real gap in the market.

PyroProtectMe has recently started up a new unusual server and has employed EFF and Katniss as Primary admins and they have taken me on as a third admin.

After just 4 days we're already seeing our server begin to fill up and a community brewing and we'd love more to come and join us and become regulars!

So first things first

* Website: Rules
* Server's IP is [68.232.169.106:27015](steam://connect/68.232.169.106:27015#/btn/lft/serverlink/1/)
* All the server maps are available for download at the website for your convenience. We are currently using Unusual_Trade_Pyro_v2ubeta3 on the Unusual Trade Server.

What gap are we filling?
---

**Nurtured Community**  
We really feel that as admins enforcing the rules is only part of our jobs. Keeping the peace in a server is less than a bare minimum. People should feel welcome on our server

We'd like the PPM server to become a home for many unusual traders but a welcome stopping point for any and all traders and somewhere that they can feel welcome to seek out advice from those who have more experience or simply experience in different areas.

If you haven't owned a hat or traded it a lot of factors can come into play when accepting an offer

We hope to be able to breed a community where people can rely on both the knowledge of the administrators and the knowledge of the community to make informed decisions on their trades so that people are more satisfied with their trades.

**New Unusual Traders**  
We've really come to understand that the market is in a place where there are a lot of people getting their first unusuals and just cutting their teeth in a higher tier of trading and that there isn't really anywhere for them to go. We hope to really help nurture a community in which newer traders can get a handle on Unusual trading and seek advice without worrying about looking good - a lack of experience should not mean you have a second rate experience.

---


We look forward to seeing you around!

All the best

1359588195.0,17lccd,[Q] Anyone else think Unusual's should be measured in bill's instead of bud's?,guancialle,53,24,54,"PSo over the past few months the price of buds have fluctuated incredibly. I remember when they were around 28 keys and since everyone measured unusual's in buds

Now bud's are back to around 26.5 keys. This unusual all though it has never changed in value all the sudden the price went from 56 keys to 50 keys and is now around 53 keys. Hopefully your still following me.


Now if we change the unusual we were talking and create one worth 10 buds

Bill's however haven't changed price in 5 months and the last time they changed price was around a 1.75 ref change. Everywhere the consensus is a bill's hat is 8 keys. Obviously painted bill's can very but a non painted bill's is always been 8 keys since i started trading. 

For this reason I believe Unusual's should be measured in Bill's and keys compared to buds and keys. Obviously with the really high unusual's there will have to be a different form of measurement like the HOUWAR

Here's some stat's for whoever is still reading this
**According to stats.tf**

* 55
* 126
* There is 2.28 Bill's hat's for every earbud
* If we make 1 earbud = 27 keys then 1 bud = 3.375 bill's

**TL;DR**

Unusual's should be measured in bill's and keys instead of bud's and keys. The reason is because bud's have been fluctuating in price over the past few months. For example a 10 bud hat that hasn't changed in terms of buds in the past 4 months has changed from being 280$ to 250$ to 265$. Not because the unusual devalued but because the currency it's measured it devalued. I believe measuring unusual's in bill's may solve this problem because a bill's hat hasn't  changed price in 5 months and when it last changed price it was only around 1.75 ref change

**Also if your unclear about anything i'll gladly explain it to you**

Or maybe that was just a Nickleback concert. Regardless

I see other posts offering Unusuals in trade and trying to enhance their value by espousing a theme for it. Well, make women faint, and it has caused men to forsake all honor and go hatless for fear of associating with this piece of head ware. This hat will haunt your dreams and harrow your very soul.

This hat is so ugly, even though she was just a regular mountain cap back then. She'd had a crush on Steve ever since he killed that spider for her in second grade, but she'd always been too shy to ask him out until senior year prom. This was going to be their night. But instead, she stayed at home, watching soap operas and eating generic brand ice cream. She boxed herself up that night, hoping that some day she'd become a beautiful Unusual, and maybe her sunbeams would be enough to win Steve back and get her happy ending. Then, I opened the crate and disappointment hit us both like a train of... well

The following is a picture of the hat

See? Told ya so. And now your cat's dead because you didn't listen. Don't pay attention to the Medic in the photo. He's just thumbs upping the Sniper across the street to end his hat induced misery. So that's the hat I'm selling. God only knows why you'd bid on it though. I feel dirty just having it in my backpack. Seriously. Don't buy this hat. It brings nothing but sorrow and heartbreak.

Opera.",1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/w8e63/psa_i_ported_the_flair_linker_script_by_zedadex/,"So, um, hi there.

As the title suggests, it wasn't available for Opera so I decided to port it on my own.

Currently

It is *not* a user script. User scripts can't access the internet (or in this case, that makes it a little bit more complex), so that's the only way to make this work in Opera.

If you don't feel like installing an extension made by a random stranger on the internet, feel free to do so! The .oex file is actually a renamed zip file, so you can extract it with your favorite zip tool and look at the source code.

So, press Ctrl + Shift + E to access the list of currently installed extensions, and go to the settings page of this extension.

(If the backpack link doesn't work, they can be accessed by pressing Ctrl + Shift + E.)
