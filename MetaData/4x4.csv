Where my Yota's at? Link is to small album: http://imgur.com/a/EgL2e#0

Been working on this little build for a couple years now. Originally I just wanted a nice truck as a present to myself after finishing grad school and becoming gainfully employed. After about a year of ownership I fell in with the wrong crowd and started wheeling.

It's more of an overland build (2nd gen tacomas are simply too long for hardcore rock brawling)

The vitals:
- 2009 Tacoma/1GR-FE 4.0L V6/A750F Automatic Tranny
- Factory Offroad Package (including locking rear differential and traction control)
- Factory Tow Package (Heavy Duty Alternator and Transmission Cooler)
- 4"" front/5.5"" rear lift. The suspension is a blend of many big names and some custom fabrication. I can go into detail if requested.
- Fabricated steel bumpers front/rear. Custom rock sliders. 1/4"" steel front skid plate, gas tank skid plates.
- 33"" (soon to be 34"") BF Goodrich KM2 MTs.
- Regeared differentials
- Lots of misc. electrical/recovery goodies: Lighting by PIAA and KC HiLites, WARN M8000 winch in hitch-mounted cradle, gobs of straps and shackles...Hi-Lift...

The fabrication was done by a friend who fabs professionally. Differential regear was set up by East Coast Gear Supply in Raleigh NC. I performed all installs (suspension, etc.) myself.

I built the site because I was doing a rear disc conversion on my 4Runner and was trying to find someone that had made the brackets (it was with Montero parts, I searched some forums, found no one making the brackets, and figured we all needed a place to find and sell parts like this.    
                                                                                                                          
The site is for selling just about whatever you make - disc brake brackets, etc.  It's called [Roundforge](https://roundforge.com).  You can check it out [here](https://roundforge.com).  

Suggestions are welcome.  I've got good feedback about the idea from people
