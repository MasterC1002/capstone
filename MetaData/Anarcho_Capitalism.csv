I then asked:
""if government only has legitimacy through consent and only a little more than 1/3 of the population gives its consent

I was greeted with a blank stare and a stuttered answer about how it was still ""technically a majority"" to which I replied with one of my favorite quotes (from Lysander Spooner) ""The principle that the majority have a right to rule the minority

I'm JamesCarlin, you might wish to stop by /r/MarketAnarchism, read the side bar, play nice, and then post your questions.

**Combative:**

Reading the various ""questions"" in our recent flood of visitors, are treated combatively with a debate-like dynamic.  This demonstrates to me that you are not genuinely interested in a response, and instead mostly causing trouble and wasting time.  

**Educational:**

My suggestion is, perhaps you will ask it in such a way you can learn something.  If you are genuinely interested in learning, perhaps you'll learn what *""Anarcho-Capitalism""* actually promotes, undermines, or doesn't care about.  Treating this as a learning opportunity will allow you to make informed decisions and help others do so as well.

**Note to AnCaps:**

AS a quick note to AnCaps, and less towards those who are uninterested and combative.

How can you argue that if everything was privately owned that the quality of life for Romans would have been better? 

Private prisons are already showing their flaws

Fire departments used to be privatized. due to the fact that they were inefficient and not motivated by helping people they were replaced by the much more effective state run system we have now. Did you know that? I don't understand how you could argue for privatization of everything when it has been proven to be less effective than state control historically.

Backstory: I was very drunk and very high. I had rode my bike out to the bar

In my drunkenness and to make her laugh

""FUCK YOU that's a $150 summons. You just made my night."" That's a quote.

So we go upstairs to the cop area

They run my info and they see my unpaid open container from last year

I calmly tell the police that by kidnapping my under threat of force they have committed a far more violent act than I have

In the car I ask them if they've ever had a beer on the beach. One says yes

I ask them if they ever use the word ""hero"" to describe themselves. They get angry.

Once finally booked, and multiple photos of my visible tattoos, I am thrown into a cell with about 50 other guys. We are then separated further into two holding tanks, one for felonies and one for misdemeanors. My wrists are cut and bleeding from the handcuffs.

In the misdemeanor holding tank ""oldport"" I am one of about 25. There are 2 other white people. One is a dopesick teenager who was caught with heroin. He's very sick and been there for 3 days. The rest are latin and black.

The most serious crime was an older guy who was caught with a box of bullets. A few teenagers are there for selling weed. Most are victims of ""stop and frisk"" who had a warrant because of an unpaid open container. One guy was stopped for spitting on the street and then arrested for his unpaid ticket.

It is like 100 degrees in the cell and it stinks. Everyone is coughing and sneezing. An old guy who does not have all his faculties shit himself. We are given a filthy bucket of water to all share to share. When it runs out

After another 12 hours I meet with my public defender and am taken to court. I am given an [ACD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjournment_in_contemplation_of_dismissal) which is essentially a dismissal and am free to go. 

The $200+ in fines I owe is magically wiped away. It is obvious to all that our detainment helps the city in regards to the receipt of state and federal funds for law enforcement.

""If I had asked people what they wanted

Reason I'm thinking about it in the context of AC is that it clearly illustrates the futility of trying to convert people to a system that they cannot yet see for themselves

In business, make the new product, and then show it to a target audience who either buy into it or not.

You also don't try to sell it to just anyone.  This is where the word ""target audience"" becomes particularly important.  There are early adopters

But it's absolutely key to actually have the product already there for all to see.  Think about, private currency.  Satoshi didn't talk about it, he built it and now we see the widening circles of adopters being attracted to it.  Simple.

Which leaves ACs with three options, like Groupons for taxpayers).  

The sooner ACs can make those options happen

*However

*GDP was up


*It was times like these,*

*That the strangest of thoughts crept into Bernanke’s head.*

For centuries the State has enslaved people into its armed battalions and called it “conscription” in the “national service.” For centuries the State has robbed people at bayonet point and called it “taxation.” The State has cloaked its criminal activity in high-sounding rhetoric.""

I expected to be bombarded with cries that taxation is not theft

Teachers, I could see that they were very disturbed by this reality. 

Sadly, for example, the drug war with taxation. They can't see that supporting government healthcare is supporting taxation, which is theft. They can't understand that regulations are enforced by the gun of the state, but they will agree that pointing guns at people is wrong.

Note: There are many other ways to start

* **Property**-Property comes up for auction whenever it is landed on for the first time. The real estate agents have the rights to the property (but do not ""own"" them per se; they collect no income unless they buy them) so they collect the proceeds from the auction. The property goes to the highest bidder. The real estate agent cannot bid in the auction (bidding would just consist of them bidding everything they have and then giving themselves back the money in addition to the property they just ""bought"") but has the right to sell her right/claim on the property to any other individual who is more interested in the money from the auction than the property being sold. For example, Player C, and Player D now try to outbid each other to buy the property. We'll say Player A wins with a bid of $2000. Player B pockets the $2000 and Player A now has full ownership of the property. 
One of the very few things that is not negotiable in the game is the amount charged when someone lands on a property you own. We always go by what the property card indicates: number of houses, or whatever.

* **Contracts**-Contracts are a **huge** part of this game, business plans, and anything that can pop into your head that someone else will agree to. In the games that I've played, contracting helped us reach a higher level of sophistication and allowed gameplay to carry on more smoothly. I'll mention this more when I talk on other things.

* **Acquisitions, and Other Investments**- The option to buy someones property is always open as long as they agree to it. Usually in the middle of the game we see a lot of mergers where owners of say board walk and park place agree to merge so that they can both get the benefits of owning the ""set"". In this way they can put hotels or houses on their property and gain a much larger income. The percentage that each person owns is up to negotiation between the partners. In a set of 3, each of the individuals usually own 33% of the company unless someone is bring hotels or houses to put on the properties. In sets of two it's usually 50/50 or when someone brings in hotels we see 60/40, 65/35 or something of that sort. Now again, those aren't *rules* those are just trends that I see in negotiations.
Sometimes when someone is running low on capital they'll do an IPO and sell stock of their company to help them get back on their feet. I'm sure you guys already know the basics of this so I won't go too far into it. Bottom line

* **Investment Management**-This has been the newest idea and needs more testing (hopefully that's where you guys come in) but it works by one player starting an ""investment fund"". The hardest part (as in real life) is to convince other players to let the fund manager temporarily invest their money. The fund works by asking players for use of their money for a short amount of time (say two or three turns). After all the money for the fund has been collected, if the fund manager has $1000 to invest he may make an agreement with the Boardwalk Parkplace Co. to buy 20% ownership for two turns for a price of $400. The fund manager may then make an agreement with the owners of  Pacific Ave. North Carolina Ave. and Pennsylvania Ave. (green properties at end of board) for 35% ownership for two turns for a price of $350. After the two turns are up the money is handed to the original investors in the fund according to what percentage they own of the fund. So if each put in $500 originally and therefore have 50/50 ownership, they would divide the returns equally between the two of them after the fund manager takes a percentage cut of the profit of course. All of this would best be done through contracts of course. This is a good strategy to have if you do not end up owning the Boardwalk/Parkplace set or dark green set.

* **Loans**- The players that start out with the cash (bankers) are always hungry to give loans and there's always demand for them. Whenever we first played the game the bankers bid each other down to loans with 1% interest. We slowly saw interest rates rise but never very much. We've come a long way and have since understood that you can't make any money of these unless the interest rate is at least 10%. This is usually around where the interest rates stay

* **Insurance**-This is a fairly new concept in our games so we don't have very much experience

* **Law**- There haven't been many problems with enforcement because everything has really been taken care of by contracts. However, they would have to compete for clients.  Who knows. Overall, we don't have many disputes that can't be solved, but there are still some.

* **Bankruptcy**- We still need to formalize the process of bankruptcy but how it has usually gone: pay player who you immediately owe. Auction off property houses, the player is officially out of the game. **Chapter 13**- The individual is insolvent but has a decent capital structure that can be worked with. The arbiter of the creditor and debtor helps negotiate how much debt can be forgiven or suggest payment plans. Purpose of Chapter 13 is to reorganize debt to help creditors get some of their money back and so the individual in debt does not go out of the game prematurely. 

**NOTE:**This game is actually incredibly hard to win. Most last 4-6 hours and many have gone unfinished. Turns out that free markets are actually pretty fair. Who would've thought?

**MISSION SUCCESS**

Edit: Spelling, example in property section for clarity, added investment management section (forgot on accident), added more content on polycentric law with and without players as arbiters, and added ideas for chapters 7 &amp; 13 bankruptcy. Also, we usually don't play with chance or community chest.",,self,,

**Personal note:** You laugh at /r/politics and /r/anarchy for silencing you through downvotes but you do the same. What seems so obvious to you (that markets always behave more efficiently than monopolies) may not seem as obvious to others. Just as what seems obvious to people at /r/politics (that a land without government is chaos) is something that you vehemently object to.

So what do you do? You criticize the people who mock and you downvote the person who came with questions. 

/r/Anarcho_Capitalism is only different from /r/politics in size. I believe that if we grew to anything near their size the amount of ignorant people here who enjoy the circle jerk and despise objections would simply gain a stronger voice.

**Edit 2:** I'm still going through this post by crackheadphilosopher and I think some more should be pointed out. At one point he mentions how a Dicken's article shows what can happen if anarcho-capitalism is allowed. Now his logic is not sound, perhaps that's justifiable when he uses a poor argument but the following post says ""Dude, I read a Heinlein novel and the future looks trippy.

http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/16gtus/any_other_quasianarchocapitalists/

Honestly, they call for a complete rejection of the AnCap position on almost anything. I'm not saying there aren't areas of legitimate debate in AnCap (children's rights, abortion, and to an extent intellectual property), but the objections raised are not really ones that I would expect out of AnCaps...

Here are some things users mentioned:

- NAP absolutism - So when are you allowed to enslave me and why?

- Rejection of Lockean Proviso - When are you allowed to decide how much property *I* can gain and why? What better right do you have to the property? 

- Absentee ownership - How do you engage in long-term speculation without absentee ownership

- Blurring of person and property (self ownership) - Really? This is a silly qualm of left-libertarians who for some reason can't understand the idea of a person having a right to exclude others from his or her body.

- Foggy nature of homesteading - Sorry dude

- Rejection of the coercive nature of property rights claims - So, guys, property rights are created to *prevent* coercion.

- Assumes property rights a priori - Not really. There are many justifications for property rights which do not start out as axioms.

- Market fundamentalism - This is one of the ones that baffle me most. An anarcho-*capitalist* argues against markets? And what's the alternative?

- ""I think we need to recognize the possibility for [DROs etc.] to rule over geographic regions using violence and become de facto governments."" - I think we need to read Hasnas's paper on the rule of law: http://faculty.msb.edu/hasnasj/GTWebSite/MythFinalDraft.pdf

- ""The NAP is getting used too often as an excuse to use violence against others. It's far to easy to spin any scenario into a subjective experience of being attacked and therefore a reason to defend ourselves."" - No it's not. Violence is a pretty definitive thing. As to the understanding of violence

- ""When property gets abandoned needs particular attention. Locke seems to have answered this with the idea of labor spoiling within property"" - I agree that abandonment needs some attention, it can't spoil. Locke's fuzzy wording appears to have caused much mischief to classical liberalism. It's time to categorize Locke with Smith - useful in their time, but improved on later.

- ""I think we need to bury the hatchet regarding absentee ownership with the left. I don't necessarily agree with all their views on the subject

- ""Enclosure is a real problem and without an objective approach to abandonment, working for people through the market. Why does the market suddenly fail?

I don't mean to stop all debate and exploration outside of ""standard"" AnCap thought

-if you want to open a company and start doing business you're forced to pay YOURSELF in your OWN COMPANY the state prescribed minimal wage

-to do that you have to pay for the state owned pension fund (obligatory), you have to add up around 400-500€ that go to the state. It will cost an employer around 1,1k or 1,2k€ so that the worker can get his or her minimal wage.

-obligatory social and pension payments are by no means limited. What does that mean? If you want to pay your employe, you read that correctly.

-on the other hand...the maximum pension or social welfare check that one can get ARE LIMITED. It doesn't matter if you paid 200€ or 6000€ per month

-the so called social and ""fair"" healthcare that we can enjoy in exchange? My friend broke his tooth last week. He's classified as an urgent but not critical case and will be getting a thorough exam...wait for it...in 175 days. That's just so they will check out what happened and how could they treat this. To actually do something he could wait up to 450-650 days. He will of course pay for a much better and faster treatment in a private hospital from his own pocket. Even though he payed hundreds upon hundreds and hundreds of euros in the state owned health fund.

This is a stupid claim, you need to spend many thousands of dollars to be allowed to be a *florist* as apparently occupational licenses are so important, because if you buy a ""bad"" (i.e. not-state-approved) bouquet of flowers, you will no longer know what to do. Finland is also planning to cut its corporate tax from the current 24.5% to 20%; meanwhile, the US has the highest nominal corporate tax rate at 35% (of course, no one actually pays that much tax, or the small companies might do it

Of course, individuals pay roughly 70% of their wages in taxes on average according to Swedbank. Individuals have to pay much. Companies do not, however. If they were forced to, they would just move out of the countries. Nevermind Finns still arguing that taxes don't discourage companies.

I really find that one of the greatest issues when arguing for liberty is this misconception that the United States is really all that capitalist, is blamed on the *free market*. People really have no idea that those are some of the most regulated sectors on the market! Based on this, they argue that the [Nordic model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_model) is way superior.

I'm sure Americans get this a lot too. On reddit

1. Sweden/Finland/Denmark/Norway/Iceland are in many ways more capitalist than the US.
2. These countries all had strong economic growth *before* the implementation of any welfare state. This is always completely dismissed. People even argue that it is *because* of the welfare state that Finland has a strong economy.
3. They dismiss the fact that Sweden almost went bankrupt due to the welfare state in the 90's and since then they have cut down on it.
4. In Finland
5. All these countries have aging populations and by 2050 roughly half of Finland's population will be retired (compared to 1/4th today). These countries are reluctant to accept immigrants too. The government gets less tax-money

So the cops come and seem legit. I don't have many personal negative experiences with cops so I maintained that most cops are decent people, take fingerprints, find footprints in the backyard, sound very hopeful, and give us a direct contact for our case.

For about 3 days

On the 3rd day, they haven't called back and won't answer my calls so I post the pics on Reddit. Within an hour, someone responds with a name. I find a facebook account, and prior arrest records on the internet. I send them to the cops. The detective says he's not convinced but he'll send off the information. He calls back 20 minutes later and says begrudgingly ""ok, we've sent out deputies to the last known address"". 

They recover the iPad and probably arrest some people (they stopped giving me details and taking my calls when they didn't need information from me that made them seem useful).

So I did the work of 4 detectives while working my normal job and had I been able to hire a different security agency

Hello /r/anarcho_capitalism
- The most important point I would like to get across is that when you are engaged in a discussion with another individual on reddit is that **your most important audience is everyone except the individual you are replying to**.  As a neutral party who is interested in a discussion of policy I have no strong opinions about, is going to defend to the end of the thread his opinions on the subject no matter what information you bring up, and if they’re frustrated, it will usually get ugly.  As such, you have zero interest in swaying their opinion – that they might appeal to reason by the end of it would merely be a nice bonus.  To the neutral party viewing the exchange, the side that resorts to personal attacks, snarky, or intellectual cowardice is not going to be convincing.  Often, illogical, regardless of what content was brought up.** Swrdfshtrmbns
- When you come across a post to which you would like to reply, or to explain its benefits, etc.  You want to appear to be curious and hopefully develop a discussion in which the other contributor feels safe and respected.  Understand that this other person may not be looking for a debate.  After all, many of them do just jabber on in their herd and will get angry if actually challenged.  Do not pursue this kind of person.  Only continue with reasonable people.
- Define your terms!  There are a lot of complicated ideas and they are often expressed and perceived differently by many different types of people.  If you want to introduce an idea, you are dealing with someone who does not want to enter into a reasonable discussion.  Don’t think of a snarky dismissal, just end the conversation.  Most reasonable people actually do want to understand what you’re talking about.
- Understand what the other person wants to know about your position.  This may come as a shock to many of you guys, and counter with unrelated, unrequested information.  Did you interpret their incredulity to your initial response as disparagement?  Well guess what?  Boo fucking hoo, patience is a virtue, answer them kindly; it isn’t so easy being a revolutionary, is it?  What would you think if you were in their position?  Answer them to the best of your ability.  **What if I cannot answer their question?**  TELL THEM THAT.  Honesty goes a long way, and think of it this way: To be a casual statist and participate in debate, you have to know an extremely vast and extremely complex host of ideas that most of us would have never encountered without the internet.  No reasonable person expects you to know everything.  Here

**“While I agree with the categorical imperative of the ability of market solutions to solve this problem

Boom.  Fucking done.  It looks like you won without even making a point.  It has this rare quality that few discussions have on reddit: RESPECT FOR DISCOURSE.
- See what the real objection is of the person you are debating.  More times than not, you look like an idiot.  Instead of going down that path – you would have to detect this maneuver first, I admit – pose this question:

**“For the sake of expediency in this discussion, would you still otherwise be opposed to my position?”**

They will have a hard time answering that.  If it is “Yes”, then you may have a breakthrough in the discussion – keep at that objection!  If it is something like “I could never be convinced to agree with you, even if my objections were addressed”, end the discussion because this indicates that the person is not reasonable.
- Refrain from personal attacks.  Similarly, not really, or just vaguely so.  There are a lot of you who do not really know what these things are, but you use these terms anyway to escape responsibility.  Also, try not to respond to a personal attack by calling out a personal attack.  Guess what?  We all know it’s a personal attack, and sometimes the neutral parties quickly feel like watching children fight at the playground when this happens.  A much better response would be to take the high ground and respond to the questions – if there are any still around at that point.  The words will speak for themselves.
- We actually don’t know all the answers.  There are some things that are too esoteric in nature to speculate exactly on how they’ll work in a stateless society, but it happened anyway.
- Do not come back to /r/anarcho_capitalism or /r/againstallarchons expecting the rest of us to bail you out of a terrible situation you created.  Notice how virtually nobody gets involved in train wrecks because nobody wants to be associated with a bad debate.  I am ruthless in my criticism of this kind of cowardice.

Forget Ali - Frazier; ignore Santelli - Liesman; dismiss Yankees - Red Sox; never mind Silva - Sonnen; the new undisputed standard by which all showdowns will be judged happened in Spain over the weekend. During a debate on Europe's crisis, to the Japanization of world economies and the demand-side bias of every- and any-thing - interested only in the short-term economic growth; the gentlemanly Spaniard notes, with regard to the European crisis, the fact that ""Keynesians got us into this mess and now we have to sacrifice our principals so that they can get us out of this mess"". Humble and generous in his praise - though definitively serious with his criticism - Schwartz opines: ""Often Nobel prize winners are tempted to pontificate on matters that are outside the specialty in which they have excelled,""noting ""the mantle of authority whereby what ever they say - whether sensible or not - is accepted with resignation from some and enthusiasm by others."" Krugman's red-faced anger is evident at the conclusion as he even refused to shake Schwartz's hand after the debate.

That night Murray and another professor spent a great deal of time in a discussion with one particular young man. This young man had made somewhat of a nuisance of himself, thus harming other people. He insisted that this justified any restriction of freedom necessary

&gt;This young man was eager to push his view and engaged many people in conversation, or simply pointed out logical inconsistencies, he pushed on because it was still possible ‘somehow’ that a third party ‘somewhere’ would be harmed by even the smallest possible amount of ‘pollution’. When he was present it was impossible for any discussion of libertarianism or austrian economics to even get started. The talk always got bogged down on the question of whether it was possible for any individual to live their life without affecting the eco-system and his point that humans necessarily harm each other just by existing, so someone had to control peoples behavior. In his view all of libertarianism was false because we missed this basic point. He could not be dissuaded.

&gt;The night that we ended up at Dennys, maybe something else is wrong”. The driver points to the gas gauge which reads empty and says “see, no gas”. The eternal skeptic says, “maybe the gauge is defective”. The story goes on and on in this vein and ends up with the empty gas tank removed from the car and split open with an axe.

His [full speech here](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/07/13/remarks-president-campaign-event-roanoke-virginia).

&gt; So I’m going to reduce the deficit in a balanced way.  We’ve already made a trillion dollars’ worth of cuts.  We can make another trillion or trillion-two, because they want to give something back.

Because voluntary trade creates a mutual value surplus, and without depending on the coercion of the state, these wealthy people have already benefitted society _much more_ than have those who didn't become wealthy.

&gt; They know they didn’t -look, well, it must be because I was just so smart.  There are a lot of smart people out there.  It must be because I worked harder than everybody else.  Let me tell you something – there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there.

&gt; If you were successful

Education

It's true that we all benefit from one another. But we don't need coercive wealth transfer in order for this to happen.

&gt; The Internet didn’t get invented on its own.  Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet.

The private sector was already heavily involved in research on getting computers to talk to each other. As I understand it

The US government bought the [ARPANET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET) project (the fledgling internet) for military purposes

Whether or not the government invented the internet depends on how we interpret the words 'invented' and 'internet'--whose meanings can both be contested. What we can be much more confident about is the much less ambiguous claim that government involvement _severely delayed_ the arrival of the internet as we know it.

It did this by buying the rights to an idea, and the internet finally entered the life of the 'average joe'. More details on the history of the internet in [this wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet#Opening_the_network_to_commerce).

&gt; The point is, but also because we do things together. 

'Doing things together' in Obamaspeak

&gt; There are some things, imagine if everybody had their own fire service.  That would be a hard way to organize fighting fires.

Trying to do things in isolation versus doing things on the basis of coercive wealth transfer is a false dichotomy. Genuinely 'working together' implies cooperating _voluntarily_,False,self,t5_2qorf,False,,,t3_woyu0

Soon, and consume smaller competitors. Let's say, FoodCo., a food company, grows and grows until it holds a monopoly over the food market. MachineCo. goes through a similar process. Etc., Etc., until all markets are monopolistic in nature. Small businesses simply cannot compete, or what effect buying local has. How could they be?

So, ComputerCo., HollywoodCo., MedCo., and so on meet to discuss an exciting opportunity.

They will take large tracts of land and convert them into huge corporate lands

They will cover most of the land with these facilities. All workers are required to move into these else they will lose their job. Naturally they all move in. They put the lower working class, into less cared for apartments and cheap townhomes. They don't like it? They lose their job. And the executives send their name and description to the other companies in the conglomerate so they know not to hire this person.

The more specialized workers get placed into higher luxury housing

The companies establish large, and live in lavish and luxury as long as they don't question their authorities and keep up with keeping any unhappiness in the workers down. Naturally they have zero interest in angering the higher ups.

Soon, Naturally people get upset and start to riot, and strike. The rioters are killed, the strikers are fired, and replaced with desperate bums living in the slums that aren't within the facilities.

They still market their product to the ""middle class"", engineers, etc., keeping the market going.

This establishes a rigid caste system. No class mixing either. The middle class is educated to replace their parents. The Military class is trained to keep down resistance. The lower class is trained to not think

They use violence

The executives, also will not accept individualism. ESPECIALLY if it is counter-productive.

Some rules they laid out...

1. If you are hurt/sick to the point where you cannot work, and have your identity sent to all other sources of employment to prevent employment.

2. You must procreate. A women must bear 2 children in her ages 16-35. If she does not

3. Homosexuals

4. Any kind of rebellion is punishable by death

Sounds terrible doesn't it?

The people in the slums of the outside cannot do anything because the conglomerate protects the resources by military force.

The environment deteriorates because the conglomerate has no interest for such trivial affairs.

Obviously he was taken aback. I'd made the argument from violence before

He said from that perspective it is hard not to answer as an anarchist. It amazes me how when the doublespeak is stripped away

I think framing the argument personally is key. The only reason government has power is because it has the sanction and manufactured consent of people. We outnumber them.

Government is a delusion. Just like religion is a delusion, once the consequential arguments are stripped away, he found he could not in good conscience enforce his beliefs through the strong arm.

I remember this when I realized I was an anarchist. You reach a point where you can't maintain this fantasy in the face of reality, no matter how uncomfortable.

The clergy is not the most deceptive or powerful charlatan we have to deal with. And we can see how well that struggle is going in /r/atheism.

The struggle for economic freedom, in the marketplace for ideas, we favor simple explanations with greater explanatory power. While this doesn't fully vindicate us, the urge to experiment with voluntary societies will become undeniable as the evidence mounts.

They reacted... like Marxists.,WilliamII,83,16,106,"I'm a junior in university. Today in my political theory class we were assigned to create a government based on one of the theorists we've been studying (Aristotle, Rousseau

We *had* to choose a ""favorite"" and use their writings to create our ideal government. So we all split into groups by theorist. Myself and 3 others went with Locke (the smallest group by FAR); the largest groups were followers of Rousseau and Marx. Big fuckin' surprise.

I'm still a relative newcomer to this realm

We rooted AnCapistan in Locke by emphasizing consent of the people and free-markets. (It was a stretch because Locke is big on the legislature

The best part of today was when I told them they would have the freedom to do anything that doesn't violate anyone else's rights; that each man is his own sovereign. Their eyes lit up like

Presentation time came and we laid out the basic ideas:

* No government or centralized power
* Private property-based
* Market anarchy
* Voluntary association
* Sovereignty over one's self

Most questions were easy and expected (thanks to all the awesome posts and links I've been reading here for the past 9ish months). Stuff like defense

Then the Marxists presented. What follows is
It was never *real* to me before I looked at someone while they advocated killing or brainwashing opposition... That was a fuckin' trip.

They made it clear that their ultimate end is total global domination; all people **will** submit to their system. And if you don't cooperate? One girl said ""We'll probably have a 'Ministry of Love' or a 'shaming bureau' to deal with the uncooperative"".

They also enthusiastically advocated widespread use of ""indoctrination and propaganda"" to keep the ideology alive
I raised one question to them:

**""Aren't you concerned that once the state controls everything that it will not want to give it back? What if it decides that

They told me: **""It can't happen

1368886380.0,1ekrsm,Advocates of Nonviolence Must Oppose Gun Control,RyanPig,75,9,49,"A very common accusation lobbed against those who oppose gun control is that they are endorsing a culture of continued violence, by the State.  Every gun control advocate is a violence advocate


A pacifist might now object and claim that while the State's centralized control of violence is not justified, this is the end result.  People know they are out gunned by the State, and that is a reason many are obedient.  Arming yourself is therefore not an act of violence or a threat of it, but the end of violence that is constantly being committed against the unarmed. 


As Matt Zwolinski eloquently stated in an article about the Black Panthers' policing tactics in San Francisco


The goal of the pacifist ought to be the end of all violence, agreement and cost-benefit analysis.  What I ultimately advocate is not an arms race of citizen against government, but an end to the sort of relationship that would result in the threat of violence always looming above the heads of the defenseless.  If you want to end violence in America, start by purchasing a gun.


The Left fancy themselves advocates of peace and equality.  IF this is true, possible.  They must begin supporting a society of radical individualism, where people are free to make choices without a Leviathan state capable of ending resistance whenever it likes.


With this in mind, but be a powerful statement of nonviolence.

I came across r/Anarchism relatively quickly. Being an Ancap it seemed like a nice place to start. I was promptly greeted with a rather confusing front-page message about being anti-boss and anti-capitalism. To say the least, the main subreddit for Anarchism was specifically anti-me. Not off to a great start. I had always wondered why the left-anarchists were anti-capitalist, so I started a thread and asked. I was promptly attacked for my beliefs, and was downvoted instantly. Awesome start to my Reddit experience. Suggesting classic Ancap literature in the literature thread got instantly downvoted. So much for not downvoting beacuse you disagree with people's opinions.

I then found this subreddit, rejecters of the NAP, etc. Interesting time to stumble in. Found a lot of intersting topics here and in r/Voluntarism. Then you guys got put in r/ShitRedditSays for something, where you guys were criticized for having a ""pretentious logo"" (As a man who's first book going down the rabbit hole was Rothbard's *For A New Liberty*, this hurts) and for being cold, heartless, and other things. This place is ridiculous. The least open-minded place on the internet that I've found thus far. As a frequenter of 4chan's /pol/ board, this was worse than anything I've ever come across.

Then, for being gay. ""Oh!"" I thought, ""A perfect time to defend the NAP and my views!"" I spent a couple of hours refuting bad liberal logic, getting a lot of upvotes (over 100, not too shabby for my first real contribution on Reddit) and swaying a couple of peoples' opinions it seemed. Then came r/ShitRedditSays. My contributions are currently #1 on that subreddit, with -97 or so. I have been Karma raided, going from +100 to -81 in a matter of hours.

So, and I've started making some plans for myself.  Get a decent job with decent, average-ish income ($20/hr), invest most of that income in mutual funds that have good five year track records, and hopefully be financially set in ten years, and a millionaire in twenty.  Having graduated college without any debt and gotten myself a nice vasectomy to avoid any sudden children-related expenses, this should be plenty feasible.

I have a [spreadsheet](http://imgur.com/DKCL48q) and everything, I can [buy a personal cruise ship](http://cruiseship.homestead.com/cruiseships.html) and maybe sell spaces on it as condos, apartments, or something towards other liberty-minded folks.  Sort of like seasteading, but with less reliance on yet-to-be-developed technology.  This is a few decades off, yet, so details can wait.

First, and that while currently involves being distracted by shiny Internets.  Which brings me here: I was wondering what all the good people of /r/Anarcho_Capitalism were planning to do to acquire personal wealth, and if and how they were thinking to use that to advance the cause.

Some time ago, but also found his arguments quite intersting. I asked some questions from him, but I feel that he didn't sufficently answer them, so I thought I'd come to see if someone could answer them.

Yes, I am genuinely intersted in the subject and I hope that you will not be too harsh on me.

So here goes:

* How would an anarchist society handle law? Who decides what are the laws of the society

For example: A man gets murdered. Who will investigate his death? Obviously, gathers evidence, finds suspects, and finally the murderer has to be punished if found guily. The question: Who is this investigator, how is the punishment decided? Who pays for all this? For example, certain equipment may be needed to analyze the evidence. A forensic labotarory.

I have heard suggestions about a private security company taking this job. However, unable to pay for the investigation (or in the case of a murderer, he/she is dead)? And even if the security company can do this job, there has to be a way to decide if the suspect is guilty and if yes, what the punishment should be.

Another possibility could be a local militia or something similiar. But that has its problems too.

* How is copyright upheld? I think that our current copyright systems are not very good, and then someone might steal it and sell it as their own. Effectively this could mean that authors would not profit (enough) from their book, leading to less books and thus less culture, which in my opinion would be a very bad thing. Same applies to things like music and movies etc.

* How about currently public institutions? Would there be libraries? If yes
How about museums? Works of art? Would those be owned by private corporations? How about art forms that might not be able to fund themselves?

* How about records? How would you prove that you own a piece of land? Lets say that you buy a piece of land. That piece of land happens to be a few hundred kms away from your home. What if when you arrive there

* What about social inequality? If you happen to be wealthly (lets say your parents were rich) you can more easily afford to have high quality education and healthcare, it is much easier, thanks to the wealth.

If you however happen to be poor, and if you want to start a business, it is much harder, and you will probably have to get a loan.

Would poor and unlucky people have to live on charity?

Also

* Defense. Assuming that not all societies have abandoned the government, and someone would have to pay for all the military equipment. Tanks and fighter jets etc. are not cheap, and maintanance costs a lot.

* Environmental protection and other regulation. You can't have a company dumping its toxic waste wherever it wants. How do you regulate these? Also

* Scientific research. Someone has to pay to the scientists for the job they do. Not all research has immediate economical benefit

* Public property. Ah yes, will it not demand payment from people for using it? And wouldn't this mean that they could place very high tolls on the use of those roads? Same goes to private citizens working as the owners. So would the roads be owned by the society? And how would the payment for it be organized?

I think this is enough for now. I apologize for making such a long post

Edit: Oh wait

Also: What stops the government from being born again? Left to their own, and in the end a government is born again.

Finally, unless you have an overwhelming majority of people that support not having a government.

Suppose that tomorrow, and by what natural right, do they lay claim to anything out there?~~  Not to sound petty, but first come, first serve.  In an ideal, prosperous civilization, people would work to be granted someone else's property, or else go and find their own.  ~~With property in the United States, then protected what they sold.

~~The whole concept of ""property"" seems very flimsy to me.~~  *It seems very difficult to enforce, and on the other, that people would not give up their lives for companies under an anacap civilization, putting an absolute ceiling on retribution or ability to stop someone else from simply taking a resource out from under you as best they could and two parties basically resigned to calling each other assholes and trying to get public opinion on their side.*   It ~~ironically, despite your protests~~, virtually REQUIRES government enforcement *for maximum efficiency*, otherwise larger companies with greater resources could destroy their competition however they liked, destruction*.  ~~They could collude into price fixing~~. If any non-monopoly remains

~~I agree with you right now that the government is the greater evil, kill who they wants, war with who they want, grant monopolies to the businesses they want, subsidize them (whether they're good ""investments"" or not).  Businesses do not have this kind of power, but in an anacap system they would have even more power, being the only means of production of goods and able to afford violence, protection, either.

So work me through the first principles

On a related note, and if you can offer compelling evidence Jesus lived out this philosophy, they would be willing to shift their political views to be compatible with their spiritual ones.

I was raised a statist liberal, (exposure to the NAP?) I see the State less as a bumbling bureaucracy and more of a relentlessly destructive parasite.  Now I tend to filter everything (in the news, for example) via an individualist lens.

But in every step of my journey I've felt comfortable with the prevailing paradigm I build for myself, or incorporate other philosophies.

I've lurked a bit in this sub, but then 'changed' and started violently disparaging ancap ideas.   I've wondered why, if one were to move on from ancap, one wouldn't choose to come back here with a supportive hand instead of a vitriolic tongue.

I guess I'm asking - not what brought you here, what do you now follow and why?  What was your paradigm shift?  Is there still another 'red pill' to take?  What came along to tip the scales?  Was there something in Ancapism you just couldn't reconcile? (I'm not strong on the whole origin of property thing for example).  

Like Daffyd Thomas
