Details for why this is a big deal in comments, pretty crazy story!",Ameridrone,59,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/1glo0i/i_just_have_to_share_my_success_with_you_guys_i/

I am 29 years old, it gets more interesting. From asking around on Reddit, it seems like many people took multiple maths classes in high school, starting with Algebra 1, and Algebra 2, and usually moving onto Geometry, Trig

That wasn't the case for me. I was so bad at math that I took Algebra 1 in two parts: Algebra 1A, and that summer I ""passed"" it with a D and never took ANY more math in high school.

My understanding is that in a lot of schools/states that I would never have been able to get a high school diploma without more math

In 2003 I began attending a community college and had to take a placement test, and honestly was so hard that I had to drop it.

I would always do SOMETHING wrong, and it made me hate math even more!

I have dealt with my well below average math skills for most of my entire life, so it never needed to be addressed.

Well, the only thing even close to an aptitude that I have are computer skills. The very first class I signed up for, which I just finished, was ""college algebra"", a five week course.

If you are wondering how I even ""got in"" the class, otherwise I certainly would not have been able to enroll in the class, nonetheless, I told myself I would do it because it had to be done.

Over the last five weeks I have done almost nothing but math. I am positive that over the last five weeks I have done more math than the entirety of my life prior. 

I utilized every bit of help I could: My teacher's office hours, Khan Academy, and even my girlfriend. I practiced, and practiced.

I came into the class with such a woeful level of understanding: 

I didn't understand the concept of an equation

Let me try and give an example: saying 2^(2) = 4. I knew the ""result"" of 2^(2) was 4, that really what was happening is that you were truly trying to determine was x had been all along. I thought that x didn't have a value until you gave it a value.

I had a ton of these fundamental misunderstandings about how math ""worked"". It wasn't until this class

Anyway, I feel like with enough time I could begin to understand anything about math.

2. BECOME FAMILIAR WITH A CONCEPT. Sometimes I can get myself bogged down, practice them, use them in more advanced contexts, even if you feel you don't really get them, and as a consequence you might just get them. When I think about this I always think of a circle. You can do the math that defines what a circle is, but it's the constant repetition of seeing them that really plants the concept of a circle in your mind. Perhaps you already get the ideas you are struggling with, you just don't feel them, as you keep pushing on and working with the idea and related ones.

3. MULL OVER IT, at a later date, I look back and cannot understand why I didn't get it. Sometimes struggling with a problem gets it into the back of the mind and that is where the real work is done, without you even realizing it, in the powerhouse of your subconscious.

4. DON'T BE AFRAID TO MOVE ON. If you are struggling to understand something and you have worked it out on paper and done all you can to become familiar with the idea I think it can be a mistake to not move on. It could very well be new applications that are more advanced that give you a better understanding of basic concepts. So have no fear and keep on pushing through,,False,self,t5_2rdi4,True,,True

    [; (x^3-3x^2+x+3)(2x^3+4x^2-x-2) ;]

Use the distributive property...

    [; =x^3(2x^3+4x^2-x-2)-3x^2(2x^3+4x^2-x-2) ;]

    [; + x(2x^3+4x^2-x-2)+3(2x^3+4x^2-x-2) ;]

And distribute again...

    [; =2x^6+4x^5-x^4-2x^3-6x^5-12x^4+3x^3+6x^2 ;]

    [; + 2x^4+4x^3-x^2-2x+6x^3+12x^2-3x-6 ;]

And combine like terms...

    [; = 2x^6 - 2x^5 - 11x^4 + 11x^3 + 17x^2 - 5x - 6;]

That's correct

                           1x^3 -  3x^2 + 1x + 3

I **strongly** believe that math textbooks are too wordy and too theoretical. I understand that some parts of mathematics will always be abstract

So, many responsibilities and opportunties, and I learn A LOT every day, which is the most important thing.

My biggest regret (besides a horrible relationship in my early 20s) is the fact that I did not get a science or engineering degree - more for the rigour than the content. Not any reason to explain why it didn't happen. It is at it is....

Anyway I've been mulling taking a online math and economics degree (University of London)
I'm not someone who usually embarks on a project without thinking things through. So

Basically, you need 1) to exercise, and 2) to be able to get help.

So, and have a good memory so not all is gone. 
But I need to find a website or forum where I can re-learn algebra and calculus

If anybody knows where I can get some online textbooks that would also be great. Amazon doesn't deliver where I live.

Note that I live in Central Africa

The exercise can be seen [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cheatatmathhomework/comments/grnkw/prove_that_if_fx_0_for_all_x_f_is_concave/)--it's a simple problem demanding to be proven, and I'm struggling with my sheer inability to proof the lemmas that we learn in our lectures. I'm not retarded in the fact that I can follow a proof and understand it in the end, but when it comes to proof something on my own, I'm helpless. Surely, there are sometimes things that are rarely need any effort at all, and with some practice, I know how to prove, that this function is continuous

I sometimes wonder whether I should feel ashamed for not knowing how to prove this problem. It's a sub-problem of up to 5 that we are given weekly and that have mostly to do with proofs. The situation is different in Linear Algebra II (which I also have to attend)

I was fully aware that studying Mathematics can be really frustrating, wrote down my notes diligently and I have dozens of Math books that I've all had to use sometime. Still I notice that the lecture often covers other topics, and that's why not a single book could help me with all topics of my class.

More precisely, in Stewart's Calculus book, most of the exercises consist of calculations. That's why I'd rather say that ""Calculus"" in Germany really means ""Mathematical Analysis""--think of Tom M. Apostol's book, this is what we really do most of the time. We are given some theorems and have to prove derived lemmas.

I passed the exam because, Fourier series and so on) rather than proofs, but we need to answer every weekly exercises to be allowed to take the exam. And it's those exercises that drive me nuts. I always enjoyed Mathematics even during High School, and I was teaching myself advanced topics with books such as ""Elementary Calculus"" (by Keisler). Studying Mathematics has always been my intention, but after the first semester, things look a little bit different now. I wonder if there are people who just ""know"" how to solve these kind of problems--if so, what is there ""secret""? How did they learn this, most of my fellow students solve the exercises in groups

Frankly, especially playing piano, but I gradually lose touch to these things that I also love, when I read and learn all day. I know I need to change something, but first of all, I need to advance in my studies otherwise the lectures will leave me behind. I'd greatly appreciate any advice that you could give, advice on how to manage my studies, I think these books helped me in one way or another:

* **Spivak's ""Calculus""**--I really like his book
* **Apostol's ""Mathematical Analysis""**--A book that reflects my study the best (I think), point set topology, and so on. However his organization greatly differs from my lectures, and to be honest, it's really demanding, but his exercises also reflect the ones that I have to do.
* **Stewart's ""Calculus (Early Transcendentals)""/""Essential Calculus""**--I always tell myself that I need to use this book to learn the calculating parts of the topics

That's easy; when you're doing problems and you are trying to write symbols, then when you are doing problems you have all the practice you need to improve. It only gets better. My symbol for partials looked like my 2s but that changed once I concentrated on them. Spacing and organizing is going to be dependent on your style, though. Not everyone has the same logical flow when it comes to writing out problems. Writing math is art. That feeling when you write a perfect integral symbol is awesome.

There are three things I found ~~confused myself with~~ on the net when I looked for this answer 

1. Complex numbers represent a way to have algebra for pairs of                    numbers. From what I can understand is a+ib and c+id represent two complex numbers which can now be operated upon by us using algebra defined for complex numbers. This has applications in coordinate geometry  ? Like we can use complex numbers to model coordinate geometry in two planes but what is wrong with the existing Cartesian model? also I am not very convinced about this.. not even sure if its correct. Please don't kill me

2. Complex numbers have an imaginary part and a real part
that it can be used to model a system in which there is an imaginary 
part and a complex part. But then what exactly is the need for i^2=-1  ? How exactly does this property help model a situation which has an imaginary part and a complex part. I am wondering if this is to do with the series i forms when you keep on scaling it with i ie. i, 1 , i, -1,.... This repeating pattern somehow seems suspicious o.o;;. It cycling back to the same thing so imaginary numbers can model cyclic
patterns ? But this is related to the Cartesian system is it ? coz that is   more of (x,y) second quad, (-x,-y) third quad, (x,-y)   fourth quad. If we consider y as i and x as 1 it sorta works out. But what does that mean ? Where is this going ??

3. Complex number model rotation ? Like 1.i^2 = -1. So we rotated 1 by 180 degrees ? so does multiplying by i mean rotation by 90 ? So how does this help us in coordinate geometry ? If I am modelling a+ib and (a
a+ib
-b+ia
-a-ib
-ia+b
clearly a and b are not behaving the way (x

1298910224.0,fudg2,Going back to school!  Yay math!,JMile69,14,0,11,"So

I have years ago, vector geometry, discrete math etc... But since this was so long ago, I decide to start math from scratch.  So I'm in Calc 1 again, and enjoying it.  I remember everything conceptually, but asking me to pull the quotient rule out of my ass wouldn't have gone well, hence my decision to just restart.

Along with Calc, and stats/probability.  So basically I'm buried in math and love it.

Naturally I've had to go back and relearn a lot of that basics.  In my own time

As a result of this, but have been away from it for a long time.  For one, physically writing down these rules helps me remember them, and two, its just a nice reference.

Oddly

It's turned into a hodgepodge of mathematical rules and formulas, pages on calculating orbits, limit rules, trig functions, integrals, gravitation...  Just everything.

The point is, and kinda the point.  I expect it to be ever changing, but I would like for it to be more complete.

So heres the real questions:

1) Is there some sort of concise general math reference guide out there that I can go through with a more complete listing of rules

2) I love math

In calculus I struggle. I tend to learn math very slowly and need to feel like I have a mastery of the material or else I trip myself up with questions as I attempt to do problems. I find going to class largely unhelpful as some parts go too slow and I lose attention... and lots of parts go to fast and I'm trying to figure out how the n-th step was done while the prof is on step n+5. 

I'm very slow to get through proofs from calc. textbooks since there's nothing to imagine except numbers and operations... Whereas physics has real things to sustain my imagination.

My questions are... Is there a way to learn calc. from example based problems- and get to the proof after that? Or am I looking for a shortcut that doesn't exist? Does anyone have any resources/books to recommend?

I also get bummed out easily while doing math due to this sense of inadequacy

 http://www.amazon.com/Z-Calculus-Barrons/dp/0764144618

But this is not an ad or anything but sort of review. 
I'm in my first year of mechanical engineering and we are starting calculus. So I went to the library and found this book.
Now I'm thinking that it's going to be like a textbook or whatever and I was fine with that but wait

The book basically follows the adventures of a town counsel in some fantasy world and they are taking their first steps in discovering calculus and your character kind helps them with it. So you go about learning about the easy calculus stuff in the beginning and it gets applied to the fantasy world's problems. 

So far from what I've read ahead it gets into some pretty complicated 
stuff by the end but I'm not worried because it's read kind of like a novel. The people basically have problems that they couldn't solve before and you follow them around while they discover how calculus can be used. There are also work problems after each chapter that highlight what was done in that chapter. 

They also have EZ algebra and other EZ subjects..

Has anyone else used this book?

A first-hand look at exponentially decaying thought processes


The most common isotope of uranium, or 4.468 billion years. This means that half of the atoms in a sample will decay in that amount of time.

1 : Write the equation for the decay of U238.

y = a(.5) x
Where X is 4.468 billion years.

2: An unrealistic experiment involves 500 grams of newly-formed uranium 238. The researchers would like to know when the 500g sample will decay to 99.9999% of its value. The experiment starts in January 2010.

500g x .999999 = 499.9995

Inputting that value as y and intersecting it with the original equation gives us 1.4427e-6

.0000014427 * 4,000 = 6,445.9836.

6

By the end of the year 8445

3: The researchers would also like to know at what year it will be reduced to 400 grams.

y = 400 intersects with 500(.5) x at x=.32192809.

.32192809 * 4,000 = 1,438,374,706

1,706 + 2010 = 1,438,376,716 years.

4: The scientists soon realize that, they calculate, in roughly 1 billion years the sun will have grown in intensity that water will evaporate from the earth and soon after that, the atmosphere will burn out. At that point, 1 billion years from now, what will be remaining of the 500g u238 sample?

1 billion years is 22.38137869% of 4.468 billion years. Inputting the decimal version of that percentage, or 85.62988% of its original value.

5: While out drinking, because, that seems like quite enough time to figure that out. Then, logic would dictate that their clones would be able to utilize time travel to reverse-decay the U238 into its previous isotope, protactinium 238. This would require the U238 to go back to 2010 when it was formed, and then travel even further than that to the point where it was a newly-formed p238 isotope sample. p238 has a half-life of 2.27 minutes. p238 has an isotope mass of 238.054506. u238 has a mass of 238.050783. 

How many years would the clones and the uranium sample have to travel in order to reach that point? How much p238 would you have once you have reached the point when p238 was newly-formed?

Okay

2010: experiment starts with newly formed isotope.
~1,010: u238 sample enters time travel device accompanied by the scientist clones who I am imagining look like Muppets or something. They travel back in time one billion years to when the u238 was first formed.

They then continue on a bit more and realize that they don’t really understand how these isotopes are formed. If these things have half-lives, well I am going to assume that as an isotope decays, the mass it loses gets converted into the next isotope in the decay daisy-chain. This is probably not the case, but whatever, it is 6:26am and I am very tired.

So... they travel 1 billion years and 4.54 minutes and they reach their final destination: the u238 has reverted back to new p238. I am not sure how much p238 they have

6: The clones then travel back in the time machine to the year 2010 in order to alert their former selves what a pointless experiment it all is, and how the universe could possibly implode on itself. The scientist then says “Whatever, just give me the numbers.”

And that's how the universe ended.",self,t5_2rdi4,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/hkm2p/dude_what_a_look_at_exponentially_decaying/

I've got an exam in a few days time, I'd rather submit the proofs given.

So I'd like to take you through the proofs we were given

For a group G,p)=1. H a subgroup of G, with |H|=p^(k). If G is abelian, H exists and is unique.

----
**Sylow I** There is at least one Sylow p-subgroup in G.

We need to show existence of H.

* For abelian G it is shown

* Induction on n (assume claim shown for n divisible by p)

Take n=p^(k) and look at the centre Z. We have two options:

1. p divides |Z|

2. gcd(p

Case 1: Let |Z|=p^(e)m1. By Lagrange's theorem, m1 divides m. Z is abelian so there is a unique Sylow p-subgroup H. 

If e=k then |H|=p^(k).

If e&lt;k

Consider the natural projection pi: G--&gt;G/H. |G/H| = p(k-e)m &lt; n. We apply induction.

There is a Sylow p-subgroup **P** in G/H

Case 2: gcd(p

O_1, ... , O_k

where an orbit is a class of conjugate elements. Suppose O_1

Thus |G| = |Z| + Sum(O_i) where O_i are the 2-or-more-element orbits.

p divides |G| but p does not divide |Z|,|O^(*)|)=1. Take any g in O^(*), O^(*)=Orb(g). Then by the orbit-stabilizer theorem,

|G| = |O^(*)| |Stab(g)|, where |C(g)| is divisible by p^(k) as |O^(*)| is not.

So by induction there is a subgroup P in C(g)

----

Here I wonder

How do we know there is a Sylow p-subgroup **P** in G/H?

And when it says

&gt;So by induction there is a subgroup P in C(g)

What does that have to do with induction? I fear I may have missed the proof entirely as it keeps mentioning induction but I don't see it ever being used.

----

**Sylow II** The number n_p of Sylow p-subgroups satisfies

n_p == 1 mod p

First we show that: For a Sylow p-subgroup P, then Q is a subgroup of P.

Note P is normal in N(P) by definition. Take the quotient pi: N(P) --&gt; N(P)/P. What is pi(Q)? Take any g in Q

|pi(g)| divides |g| divides |Q|=p^(a) so |pi(g)| is a power of p.

On the other hand, thus |pi(g)| must be 1. This means Q is a subset of P.

Anyway, P_l} of Sylow p-subgroups where l=n_p. Consider the action of G on S by conjugation. It has the decomposition into orbits

S = O_1 union ... union O_L

How many one-element orbits are there?

{P_i} is a one element orbit if and only if P is a subgroup of N(P)

There is just one 1-element orbit {P} and all other orbits consist of (p_i)^(a_i) elements

So n_p = 1 + Sum((p_i)^(a_i)) == 1 mod p.

----

Here we proved that if a subgroup Q satisfies Q=p^(a) and is a subgroup of N(P) then Q is a subgroup of P

The main problem with this proof is 

&gt;{P_i} is a one element orbit if and only if P is a subgroup of N(P)

Does anyone have any idea what that even means? No other proof that I found seemed to do it exactly this way

And why do the other orbits have (p_i)^(a_i) elements? What are the p_i? I thought we considered one prime at a time.

Also

----

**Sylow III** If P is a Sylow p-subgroup and H is a subgroup of G

Consider all Sylow p-subgroups conjugate to the Sylow p-subgroup Q. B={Q_1, for Sylow subgroup P.

Consider the action of P on B by conjugation

B = O_1 union ... union O_L

|B| = Sum[i=1 to L](O_i). b is the number of subgroups conjugate to Q: b = |G|/|N(Q)|

So b = Sum[i=1 to L](O_i) implies there is an O_i with |O_i| not divisible by p.

So this {O_i} is a one-element orbit.

P is a subgroup of N(O_i) implies P=O_i.

As the title implies

My first question is: When converting integrals to other coordinates, rectangular to spherical, do you always need to sketch it to ascertain the new coordinates? I ask this because I can't figure out how to sketch 3-D graphs most of the time, and I've had sessions with counselors to help me but it just does not make sense to me.

I'm aware there are equations (x = r cos(theta), I can't figure out the angles using those equations. 

Example problems I have:

(1) Change to spherical coordinates and evaluate the integral:

The triple integral of: ze^(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) dzdydx

from [-3, √9 - x^2 - y^2 ]. (For clarity, the coordinates for dx is [-3, 0], dy is  [0, √9 - x^2  ]...)

I already know the correct answer. I understand that rho is from [0, 0]. But why is phi from [0, pi/2]? The 3D graph looks like an upside down bell. I have no idea how you're supposed to ascertain the coordinates from that, either. And again, is there a way to figure out the coordinates without graphing?

How do you know which order of integrate to pick when it comes to 3-D integrals? I always just guessed.

(2) Change the following integral so spherical coordinates (DO NOT EVALUATE)

Triple D Integral of: x dV, and z&gt;=0 that lies inside the sphere x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9. Are the bounds as followed: p is [0,3] theta is [0, 2pi] and phi is [0, pi/2]? And the order of integration? Is it possible to be in multiple octants at once, and if so, how do you find the coordinates in that case?

Can we know just by looking at an integral whether it can be solved or not? I am talking about indefinite integrals here.
Is there some general method to solve all integrals that can be solved?
How about a general method to solve all integrals that can be seen in calculus textbooks?

1302761306.0,gppj2,What would happen if you were in a 3-torus and you tied a rope to itself end-to-end and tried to change its orientation? (detail inside),SnailHunter,9,1,10,"I posted this in /r/AskScience but didn't get any responses. I think it was probably more of a math question anyway. Here's the scenario:

You're in a 3-torus in which you can travel in one particular direction 10 feet before you reach your starting point. In a direction perpendicular to that direction, the front wall is glued to the back wall, and the right wall to the left. In other words, if you are in the center of the room and walk towards the left wall, you will walk through it and re-emerge through the right wall, eventually ending up back where you started. Same thing with the front and back walls, and also with the ceiling and floor.

Now imagine you have a rope that is just a little over 10 feet long (a little extra so you can tie it)

Now for the question: what would happen if you tried to turn the now-taut rope (you could equivalently replace the rope with a 10-foot rigid rod whose two ends were taped together) to change its orientation so that it was aligned with the direction in which you travel 30 feet before ending up back where you started (the horizontal direction in the pic)? [See new pic.](http://i.imgur.com/LkQtc.png)

I'm guessing the rope wouldn't budge if you attempted this, where is this force coming from? Would this mess with conservation laws at all? Is the opposing force somehow the tension in the rope itself? I'm imagining that as you turned it, the tension in the rope would keep increasing until it eventually snapped.

I'm trying to test out a 'drop chance' method that I wrote in Java but I'm not entirely sure if I'm doing the math correctly. I'm pretty dumb when it comes to math so I just wanted to get a second opinion on it and maybe see if there was a faster/easier way to do what I'm trying to do.

Basically I get the program to loop, which is between 0.0 and 100.0, is equal to or less than the 'drop chance' of the item then the number of loops that the simulation had to go through to reach that number is added up and put into one of the spaces on a million space table.

When the simulation finishes running one million times it goes through the table and adds all the numbers together and then divides by one million to get the average number of simulated monster kills it took for an item with a specific 'drop chance' to drop.

So

            int p = 0;
    		
    		//Loops one million times.
    		for(int z=0;z&lt;1000000;z++) {

Question #1 - Differentiate

* Y' = (f'g - fg') / g^2
* Y' = ((e^4x (4)) (x^2 + 1) - (e^4x )(2x + 0)) / (x^2 + 1)^2
* Y' = (4e^4x x^2 + 1 - e^4x 2x) / (x^2 + 1)^2
* Y' = e^4x ( (4x^2 + 1 - 2x) / (x^2 + 1)^2 )
* Y' = e^4x ( (4x^2 - 2x + 1) / (x^2 + 1)^2 )


----------------------------------------------------
Question #2 - Differentiate
-

* Y = √(x + e^1-x^2 )
* Y = (x + e^1-x^2 )^1/2
* Y' = 1/2 (x + e^1-x^2 )^-1/2 (1 + e ^ 1-x^2 (-2x))
* Y' = 1/2(x + e^1-x^2)^-1/2 (-2x-2xe^1-x^2 )
* (-2x-2xe^1-x^2 ) / 2√(x + e^1-x^2 )

----------------------------------------------
Question #3 - ????
-

* This one took me forever and was extremely confusing with all of the brackets...
* If f(x) = e^-x cos2x
* Y(x) = e^-x cos2x
* Y'(x) = f'g + fg'
* Y'(x) = (e^-x (-1))(cos2x)+(e^-x )(-sin(2x)(2))
* Y'(x) = -e^-x cos2x + e^-x(-2sin2x)
* Y''(x) = (f'g + fg') + (f'g + fg')
* Y''(x) = [(-e^-x (-1))(cos2x) + (-e^-x)(-sin(2x)(2))] + 
[(e^-x (-1))(-2sin2x) + (e^-x )(-2sin(2x)(2))]
* Y''(x) = [e^-x cos2x - e^-x (-2sin2x)] + [-e^-x (-2sin2x) + e^-x (-4sin2x)]
* Y''(x) = e^-x [cos2x+2sin2x+2sin2x - 4sin2x]
* Cross out the 2sin2x's and the 4sin2x...
* Y''(x) = e^-x [cos2x]
* Now put in the number zero and see what comes out...
* Y''(0) = e^-(0) [cos2(0)]
* Y''(0) = 0

Let's say you started a film club, you'd assume the number of movies would be 10 times the number of members; however, as with any top 10 lists, there's bound to be some overlap.  Assuming any two people will have two or three movies in common (for the sake of math, let's call it 2.5), how many different movies would you expect for a group of some arbitrary size?

Now, assuming the lists are random, there's some chance that two peoples' lists will overlap, and you'd expect on average to have 2.5 overlaps.

After playing around for a while, you could think of all the movies that had already been picked as ""marked balls"", and the newest member is picking their top 10 out of a pool of marked and unmarked balls.  And, again, you'd expect them to pick on average 2.5 marked balls, assuming there were 10 marked balls (one previous top 10 list) to begin with.

So, so the search for n became my quest.  Thinking about it in terms of the real world, it's like this: if people, on average, pick the same movie 2.5 times, that means they're picking out of a fixed pool of size n.  So, it's at this point that the expected value part comes in.

By making it into an expected value problem

    [; \sum_{1}^{10}x*p(x)=2.5 ;]

That is

    [; \frac{\frac{10!}{(10-x)!}*\frac{(n-10)!}{(n+x-20)!}}{\frac{n!}{(n-10)!}} ;]

It's a little ugly, you end up with:

    [; \frac{10!*(n-10)!^{2}}{n!}\sum_{1}^{10}\frac{x}{(10-x)!*(n+x-20)!}=2.5 ;]

Now, when I plugged in an arbitrary guess of n=40, the result I got, around .04, seems way low.  Thinking about it logically, this means that if two people each picked 10 movies out of a pool of 40, you'd only expect them to have .04 in common.  That can't be right

I've recently become interested in math, it's more like a hobby, although I do hope to get to university level and beyond.

Now, I need a *system* designed to make sure that I go through the material in a pedagogical order; one that doesn't skip anything important, and makes sure that I have the fundamentals to learn each new step. This system must obviously force me to do (well written) exercises until I get it - simply reading about math won't do much good, as I think anyone would agree with.

Up until now

1. Try to do a new exercise.
2. (optional) Watch the related videos if 1. failed (or if I'm just interested.)
3. Repeat.

This worked up until I got to an exercise where I was supposed to do vector operations with complex numbers. Now, will not come up. I'm guessing this is because there's no exercises for it *yet*, and that it will at some point, but that doesn't help me right now. (Of course, they have video lessons on it, but I don't want to be in a situation where I have to look for exercises myself, as I don't neccessarily know what I'm doing

So that brings the question - have anyone here successfully gotten through the whole khanacademy curriculum without supplemental resources? Will the exercises be enough? Will I know linear algebra like my inner pockets when I'm done?

1325660107.0,o28af,What's the motivation for studying pure mathematics?,dieselhobbit,10,2,10,"(Created a new username due to the potential embarrassment; I know this is a learning subreddit and that such embarrassment shouldn't be a concern

I've been a professional game developer for over a decade, and only started finally ""getting"" anything when I could understand how they could apply to getting pretty graphics on the screen.

That said, but would very, very much like to, and that's the motivation behind exploring pure mathematics itself.

I like abstraction, without over-abstracting and over-engineering everything into a unnecessary mess.  With that said, I spend a large chunk of my time in my head, visualizing data structures and spaces and how different concepts relate.  I'm guessing that some of the inherent draw I feel in my work is similar to the draw felt by mathematicians exploring new ideas, and there's probably some decent mental overlap worth exploring.

Around a year ago (give or take) I ran across ""Lockhart's Lament"", who would I be trying to compare myself to, really?) but my lack of inherent awareness in why this is interesting in the first place, despite my love of abstraction in another conceptual field.

To put it simply: How do I explore the world of mathematics without feeling like I'm falling into an endless cavern of irrelevant solipsism?  If you happen to have read Greg Egan's novel ""Diaspora"", but has no light connecting it to the outside world.

The fact that so much of math is based on the rigor of building on previously well-established discoveries is helpful

I'm probably not expressing myself as well on this question as I would like, and intuitively recognizes the position I'm standing in right now and can help me bridge this gap:  Why study this?  Why?  There's a whole conceptual world I can see in front of me and am allured by, and I know for certain that if I can see a purpose in it, I will enjoy taking my time to explore it, but that purpose is still hiding from me.

Some background: I have a full tenured professor in charge of my math class (cal 1). He left around week 3 of the class for a 6 week research position in Scandinavia, got us through limits and derivatives, and two tests (good on both). Original professor comes back, teaches us integrals and fundamental theorem.

So Monday we got tested over that material. Previous test averages in the class were 80% for first test (review and limits) and 70% for second test (derivatives). I was well above the average in both. I do my homework. I understand what an integral is.

Class average for 3rd test: 3-fucking-5%. Yes, but he graded that one wrong so is correcting it.

Before the curve he's putting in to save his own ass (20%) not a single soul passed that test. 90% of us still won't pass it. And he's blaming every bit of the failure on us, not on him contradicting himself multiple times on content...

He is so bad (just from the 3 weeks we had with him) that we (as a class) tried to get the temp professor to be able to stay. That guy was great. He explained things clearly and you could read what he wrote. We were told

          = 0.06891488347228944

So, while it should be approximately equal to y_ecl, +3.61. I suspect the problem is in step 3, where eccentricity is converted to degrees. I'm probably not following some implicit assumption that the author of the paper is making there.

**4.** Consider the statement 'Ann is older than Betty unless Betty is younger than Claire' in the following cases:

a)  Ann is 10

b) Ann is 10

c) Ann is 10

d) Ann is 10

Draw up a truth table for 'unless'.

----

**4. Solution:**

p = 'Ann is older than Betty'

Either the statement 'Ann is older than Betty' or the statement 'Betty is younger than Claire' needs to be false (but not both) in order for the whole statement 'Ann is older than Betty unless Betty is younger than Claire' to be true.  

----

**5.** Express each of the following propositions in logical symbols and decide in each case if the subsequent statement is a valid consequence of the proposition. 

**a)** *Proposition:* If I move house

*Statement:* Since I am going on holiday in July I will not move house.

----

**5. a) Solution:**

p = 'I move house'

q= 'I am not able to go on holiday in July'

Proposition: [; p \Rightarrow q ;]

Statement: [; \neg q \Rightarrow \neg p ;] - this does follow

----

**5. b)** *Proposition:* Either the professor or the student committed the crime. If the professor did it

*Statement:* Since the professor gave the lecture at 11

----

**5. b) Solution:** 

p = 'The professor committed the crime'

q = 'The student committed the crime'

r = 'The professor gave the lecture at 11'

Proposition: [; r \Rightarrow (\neg p \land q) ;]

Statement: [; r \land q ;] - True. In order for the above statement to be true

----

**5. c)** *Proposition:* If I get the job and work hard

*Statement:* I was promoted

----

**5. c) Solution:** 

p = 'I get the job'

q = 'I work hard'

r = 'I get promoted'

Proposition: [; (p \land q) \Rightarrow r ;]

What's a metric space? To understand what a metric space is

&gt; Take the real line, where both sets of which the function is applied to lies on R (i.e the function is between set A and set B; set A and set B are subsets of R; then R, together with the function, is a metric space.

&gt; If the above is too contrived to you

&gt; * R is a set of real numbers.
&gt; * f() is a function that works on set A and set B
&gt; * set A and set B are subsets of R
&gt; * therefore R

&gt; **Example**: absolute value function

&gt; For any two points, x2)*.

&gt; *d(x1

&gt; This can be further expanded upon with a Cartesian plane

&gt; The ability to do that is trivial and left as an exercise to the reader

Now, ""hardly interesting"". From metric spaces, the notion of openness, closeness, completeness, continuity and many more concepts. Also, metric spaces are the precursor you learn before diving into funner stuff like Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces.

Applications of metric spaces: Metric spaces are interesting, X is a subset of R^(whatever amount of choices they have). Let it be closed blablabla).

It has a lot of implications in theory (topology mainly). I'm not so sure of application of metric spaces in real life.

The Problem (37 from Section 2.4):

&gt; Suppose a ""circle graph"" has 5 nodes connected (in both directions) by edges around a circle.  What is its adjacency matrix?  What are A^2 and A^3 and the diameter of this graph?

From the textbook (emphasis not added):

&gt; When A^k has ***no zeros***

**My answer:**

A = [0 1 0 0 1; 1 0 1 0 0; 0 1 0 1 0; 0 0 1 0 1; 1 0 0 1 0]

A^2 =  [2 0 1 1 0; 0 2 0 1 1; 1 0 2 0 1; 1 1 0 2 0; 0 1 1 0 2];

(For simplicity's sake

The first video I watched on Fourier analysis (PatrickJMT)

`[; \{ 1,...,sin(x),sin(2x),... \} ;] `

where all the trig coefficients are positive integers. The author then showed that this set of functions is orthogonal on the interval [; \[-\pi

Since complex exponentials essentially encompass the trig functions

`[; f(x) = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} a_{n} e^{i n x} ;]`

However, then their inner product will be non-zero on any non-zero interval. We could fix this by only using [;n \in \mathbb{N};] but we kinda need the negative coefficients so that cos(nx) and sin(nx)  ""drop out"" of the complex representation.

So what's the deal? Do we not care about the orthogonal requirement when using complex exponentials as the basis? Or is there a different definition of an inner product for complex numbers that I'm missing?

Basically here is where I am at. I understand that in real variable calculus when you integrate a function you are finding out the area under the curve. I understand how and why this works (I think). Using complex variables I extend this to thinking that when you integrate a function you are finding some 4-dimensional equivalent of area. 

Where I get lost is when we integrate along an arc or contour(not for arc length). So my question is when I integrate along a contour what am I finding out? Sometimes it seems we are asked to integrate arbitrary functions along a curve. What does this value represent in both real and complex variable calculus. I'm having a hard time understanding what I'm figuring out and it's causing me to feel confused even when I'm successfully completing the problems.

I began solving this problem by writing out all the possible combinations for 1-5. I then noticed that the amount of combinations for 1-separated sequences follows the Fibonacci sequence. So for a sequence of length 1 there are 2 combinations, and for 5 there are 13. So my conjecture is that the number of 1-separated sequences of length 15 would be the 17th Fibonacci number.

I'm a little fuzzy on the logic behind these proofs. Let me just talk about single-variable for a moment. 

* I understand how it looks
* I understand the language of it, then for any epsilon you choose, there ought to be a delta I can choose such that as long as you stay within delta units of a, the result will always be within epsilon units of L.
* I also understand that this means that one needs to choose a delta that is a function of epsilon, but not for every epsilon).
* I am usually pretty good at finding this δ function. I just manipulate |f(x) - L| &lt; ε until the left side of the inequality is identical to |x-a|.

I'm a bit foggy on a couple of things, because then you get something like this, which seems harder to deal with:

L-ε &lt; |f(x)| &lt; L+ε

Second, but it takes a while.



Third, except connected by an ""if...then"" (i.e., if ineq1 then ineq2) can be arranged into a proof, or how modifying one inequality affects the other. With trivial ones like ""if 0 &lt; x &lt; δ then |x| &lt; ε"", it's easy to see that δ must be less-than, or equal to, ε (just thinking of a number line).

First, I'm asking again. Also, I'm not native English speaker.

I'm in my early thirties (wow, I always caught it quickly, but have never developed comprehensive/deep understanding. I do have bachelor's degree in computer engineering, but besides little cramming for exams, I never really learnt anything, so most of math didn't stick. Anyway, too many times I've caught myself using approximations and spreadsheets for solving problems, it is not proper way

Basically it seems I like math, I'm here to find this out. While I have no explicit need for, I really like and it helps me a lot to know how something is working ""underneath"" before I start using it. This holds for math too, maybe even more than anything else, and unfortunately for most of my experience with math I was taught how and almost never why. My viewpoint on learning may be naive, but it seems I understand things best that way.

I would like to relearn first two years of college math properly and then see if and where I want to go further. For now I picked up Stroud's Engineering Mathematics

For example, you just throw things on a pile, but multiplication didn't seem so trivial. I explained it to myself as constructing a rectangle in as many dimensions as there are operands, and as it doesn't matter which way it is constructed, rectangle is always the same (properly rotated). Similarly, to describe what kind of approach I would like, I got to (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 . Never before it crossed my mind that you can put these variables in a table, that you can separate square into adequately sized rectangles. To me, and it seems I like approach there, maybe the best

Is it possible that approach I'm searching for doesn't make sense, e.g. symbol manipulation? And is it that just now I seem to get glimpses of what I should have got first time I was taught math?

If there is still hope for me, in a way I seem to get? I just don't seem to be able to find a book that hits the sweet spot, either it's to wordy and doesn't explain deep enough, or it is way too cryptic. What would you recommend?

I'm being totally serious.  I personally used to love science when I was younger (23 now) and I still do but back then I could not understand certain concepts and teachers would basically shrug and keep going with the class for what I later learned was to save their jobs. I was able to *just get by* with a lot of extra work up until middle school then in high school it was obvious I have no idea what is going on so I dropped out. 

It was very disappointing seeing my teachers faces as they would slide me my Fs. I remember one teacher would give me my paper last (the class would always brag and go wild trading results about who has the higher grade like comparing Christmas presents) and he would always give me a grim look and quickly slide me mines. It became a routine and after a while kids would want to see mines and would laugh.. after a while he told us NOT to show others our papers. He claimed it was because they got too wild and noisy but I have a feeling that was just for my sake. Their laughs never upset me it was just the look the teachers gave me that did. Things like this continued throughout my grade school. Teachers would implement timers for who could solve problems the quickest

I did get my GED and boy that was a mathematical challenge. It was like forcing someone with a life long phobia to overcome it over night. My GED teachers were caring and considerate but mentally

Anyway now I'm in college about to take some placement testing to see where I end up. I'm guessing basic arithmetic but I still have this phobia. I have horrible anxiety

For my career I love astronomy and physics and I was told ironically the rest of my life would be nothing but math/physics. Right now, some wanting work shown, some don't care, some let us use calculators, some don't want us counting on our hands, some we need to remember formulas, some have them on the board.. for a subject that is supposed to be ""straight forward"" I've experienced a lot of corruptness in my education.

That's my story sorry if it is too long my intention is to maybe find others like me that overcame math. I do like the power of math and what can be done with it but even using Khan-academy I mess up and it's like great another failure. I could be successful if I had a **SET OF RULES

 I am not embarrassed anymore. I am just frustrated and **sick of failing**. All of the methods I am and have learned do not seem to work and sometimes just mix.

I can grasp the 1-1 cardinality idea meaning the sets are equal in size

&gt; Take the set of all natural numbers, the set of even numbers. Question: how many elements does E have? Surely E must only have half the number of elements as N, since we threw away the other half? Not really. Consider this correspondence: for every element x in N, we map it to x*2. Since x*2 is even, x*2 is an element of E. Every number in N is mapped to exactly one element in E, and every element in E has exactly one number in N mapped to it. The fingers match!

I'm a freshman who started attending University 4 weeks ago. I'm quite rusty on math

I love my major, but let me explain this last point.

I never was that kid that got all the good marks in math without doing anything. To be honest, I also had the one or other success story in math, like the one time I flunked a calculus test. Doesn't sound so successful, I know, but I had a second try which I had to pass at all costs. Before the second try, I took the time to go through the whole material for that course and guess what, I aced the test on a second try. Yes, but the test was a completely different one. Nonetheless

I can get the correct answer by just following the steps

For example:

    The following line passes through point (4
    
    y=5/3x+b
    
    What is the value of the y-intercept b?

So

    4=5/3⋅4+b 

Simplifying: 

    4=20/3+b

Now here is where I am not understanding what steps are taken. They show the following as the next step:

    b=4−20/3

Why was the 4 placed *before* the 20/3 instead of after? To get it from the left side to the right aren't you subtracting both sides by 4..? This appears to be *positive* 4 *minus* 20/3

As I see it

    4=5/3⋅4+b 
    
    4=20/3+b
    
    -b+4=20/3
    
    -b=20/3-4
    
    -b=20/3-12/3
    
    -b=8/3
    
    b= -8/3

So we end up with the same answer. I just want to understand why their way works. 

Hopefully that makes sense.

Let p(n): 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 +...+ 2^n = 2^(n + 1) - 2

Add 2^(n + 1) to both sides:

 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 +...+ 2^n + 2^(n + 1) = 2^(n + 2) - 2

So

p(1): 2 = 2^(1 + 1) - 2 = 2. The base case holds.

So Sn = 2^(n + 1) - 2 works for all positive integers n.

I haven't used much math since I graduated school 11 years ago so I'm a bit rusty on logarithms and exponents.

There was a [question in another subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/1j0nua/so_i_take_a_track_in_129_bpmemajor_and_change_it/) about what key a 129 BPM (Beats per minute) song in E major would be if we changed its tempo to 140 BPM.

The tempo is increased by a factor of (140/129) 1.09, the key will go down 12 semi notes.

In our western musical scale

     A4: 440 Hz
    A#4: 440 Hz * 2^(1/12) OR 440 Hz * (1.059)
     B4: 440 Hz * 2^(2/12) OR 440 Hz * (1.059 * 1.059)
     C5: 440 Hz * 2^(3/12) OR 440 Hz * (1.059 * 1.059 * 1.059)
    ...

Initially

    140    / 129 ≈  1.09
      1.09 *  12 = 13.08
     13.08 -  12 =  1.08

to say that the key would be raised by about 1.08 semi notes or 108 cents (1.08 * 100, due to how the musical scale and tones work, but that kind of calculation is beyond my scope of knowledge.

Can anyone shed some light on how this is calculated? The following equations are true:

    x(1.00) = x
    x(2.00) = x * 2^( 12/12)
    x(0.50) = x * 2^(-12/12)

This gives us the following equations (I think 1.42 is rounded to 2 decimals) where we need to find *y*:

      x(140/129) = x * 2^(y/12) ≈ 1.42
    ≈ x(   1.09) = x * 2^(y/12) ≈ 1.42

A clock has its minute and hour hands at 12. After they begin moving

My solution

Hour hand angle = 0.5 * m

Minute hand angle = 6 * m

Put one equal the other, and I didn't figure out how to make it not without complicating it a lot.

Maybe this

Minute hand angle = 6 * m - 360 * h

Hour hand angle = 0.5 * (60 * h + m)

EDIT:

I figured it out!  When adding a digit, you are simply spitting out all of the solutions from last time or a(n-1) (I don't know how to do subtext), and by adding a 1 to the end of the string, you are invalidating all that were ok and ended in a 1 from the last one, but everything that ended in a 0 from the last one and were ok are fine.  Therefore it's:

a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2)  where n &gt; 1 and a(1) = 2
