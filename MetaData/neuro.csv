Grid cells were discovered in the entorhinal cortex in 2005 by the Moser group, only rather than only firing in a single place, the cells seem to respond to a triangular lattice ""grid"" of spaces.

http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v436/n7052/abs/nature03721.html

Here's a non-paywalled link: https://www.princeton.edu/~njclub/2007-06-27_papers/Hafting+etal_2005.pdf


It's an open theoretical question about how these kinds of non-intrinsic maps of space are formed. The fundamental issue seems to be the idea of internal integration of velocity information. Two main theoretical models have since arisen to try and explain this phenomena. I don't have a good citation on theta oscillation models of grid cells

http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1000291


More recent work from Sreenivasan and Fiete has suggested that the grid cell networks might be extraordinarily error resistant in ""Grid cells generate an analog error-correcting code for singularly precise neural computation""

http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v14/n10/full/nn.2901.html

NP: https://clm.utexas.edu/fietelab/Papers/nn.2901.pdf


Now for the recent results. 3 papers published in the most recent issue of Nature Neuroscience

First up, seems to depend on recurrent hippocampal input in order to form its grid structure. A reversible lesion of hippocampus seems to knock out the receptive field structure of these entorhinal cells. The Burak and Fiete model predicts that a sea of mostly uniform, slightly head-direction tuned input is enough to form grid structure, so the authors hypothesize that hippocampus might be the source of this nonspecific input.

""Grid cells require excitatory drive from the hippocampus""
http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v16/n3/full/nn.3311.html


Second, with no excitatory connections. This confirms yet another prediction of the Burak and Fiete model - that grid cells arise out of a purely inhibitory ""Mexican Hat"" connectivity profile.

""Recurrent inhibitory circuitry as a mechanism for grid formation""
http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v16/n3/full/nn.3310.html


Two more papers have done a very impressive job of patch-clamping neurons *in vivo* with a rodent walking around a virtual track. The first is work out of Michael Hausser's group, that seem to bring about tuned spiking in grid cells.

""Cellular mechanisms of spatial navigation in the medial entorhinal cortex""
http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v16/n3/full/nn.3340.html

""Membrane potential dynamics of grid cells""
http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v495/n7440/full/nature11973.html

I am really sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for posting this but I'm hoping and praying that somebody here has *any* advice for us.

This will be long but it needs to be in order for me to accurately describe my fiancé's symptoms.

He is almost 25


I met my fiancé, he suddenly started acting really strange, almost like he'd been drinking. He was slurring his speech, hadblurry vision, was having trouble walking straight and was basically just ""out of it."" I didn't know what was going on but I took care of him and he soonly after fell asleep. When he woke up, he was fine. As if it had never happened. I brought it up and he had no recollection of even being that way. He could remember the day just fine up to that point, then told me it was probably due to his multiple sclerosis. So I looked that up online and the symptoms fit (being how widespread symptoms can be for MS...). He told me he hadn't been ""officially"" diagnosed with MS because after being tested many times

As time went on, take lit cigarettes from him because he has dropped them onto himself without even noticing.

These symptoms come and go and the severity changes every time. Sometimes it is as described above and sometimes it's just *slightly* slurred speech and you can barely notice.

These episodes can happen once a week, it's so sporadic and hard to understand! They can last just one day or several days. It's really scary.

He also has chronic

Anyway, it's fibromyalgia."" OK, correct me if I'm wrong but these symptoms just do not fit. 

So he's seen many doctors, most likely. He's even gone to the ER **during** these flare-ups and all they do is hook him up to an IV and he stays til he's better. Again, never any answers.


Oh, or inexplicably anxious/nervous, can't get comfortable, or some other reason. He can go DAYS without ANY sleep. He just went three entire nights without any sleep until last night when he finally got about five hours.


Has anyone got any idea what this may be? Or what else we can do since the doctors seem clueless? I hate seeing him suffer. 

I'm going to crosspost this to as many subreddits as I can to try and get different perspectives.


Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and again I'm very sorry if this post doesn't belong here.


**Edited to add:
He says [Morvan's Syndrome](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morvan's_syndrome) is the closest thing he's ever read to what his symptoms are. (Including hyperhidrosis which I forgot to mention - sorry!) However this is so rare that when he brought it up to his doctor he didn't even know what it was. He said he would look it up and get back to us - which he still hasn't done.**

EDIT AGAIN:
I left out another symptom - sorry. His hands and feet sometimes turn purple and are freezing to the touch. Just trying to be as specific as possible.

I took an AP psychology class in high school that really turned me on to the subject and we covered a the gamut of information from famous psychological studies, another passion). All is great, except by the tail end I realize that most of my focus wound up being in social psychology which, while I find it interesting, isn’t the “meaty goodness” I was looking for. It felt like I was waiting for more of the “harder science” aspect of some topics I scratched the surface of in the AP class, but it never really came through. I’m also lacking in biology/chemistry backgrounds (but have a lot of music experience!). I wish was the other way around. My college also offered a program where you can get a one-year accelerated M.S. degree with decent grades. Cool. So I take it, and now have an M.S. in Professional Communication (really it’s more like marketing/advertising with a focus on working in a professional world). Sort of a silly degree


Work at Best Buy for 6 months. Fuck that. To the present!


Move back to the city where I grew up to be closer to family and take time finding what it is I’d like to do. Get lucky, get it in June of 2012. I’m now a neuropsychology technician doing the day-to-day research on cognition in autoimmune disease, and I love it. Getting my name on some small stuff, having a lot of fun doing the things I’m doing. (The M.S. degree honestly helps with recruitment too.) Thing is, with budget cuts and it being very, very hard to get funding through NIH (we’ve written 3 grant proposals in 5 months) the current grant is running out of money. That that is where my entire salary (it’s “low”, but much better than Best Buy) comes from. We are trying to extend the grant’s budget so that it won’t terminate on 5/31/13 – ending my position. I may have to go to 20 hours a week (okay) and our team is trying to find other opportunities either here or in other departments for me.


A few proposed options are: 

* Stay at 20 hours until my position ends and “find” a job somewhere else (“find” meaning it would really suck and would be another painful process… especially because of how short this position has been

* Cut back on research and take up as a clinical neuropsychology technician instead of research (not ideal

* Find research opportunities under other researchers that my team may know (although it may divide my time up


My thoughts:
I’ve been self educating on neuroscience (reading and testing myself through textbooks, communication or social related would be a dream. I want to learn more about affect regulation, I am interested in learning much more about neuroimaging and animal models, and I would like to experience and learn through research and such first-hand. I think the right neurology would be interesting as well, and this new connectome stuff is neat (I know very little about both). But… I have no background in any of these areas. No formal biology since high school. I just have passion, potential, and the drive to make it work. I guess my question is: what would you do in my situation? For someone who is heavily considering higher education in the future (but wants to learn more about what specific field through experience), but I think it intersects nicely with my neuroscience interests – what about that? Should I voice my concerns in a well-written email to my P.I. so she knows where I am coming from and can help me land softly?

2. The comment system on reddit could then similarly be used for expressing scientific criticisms of the linked research article.  Each thread could naturally evolve according to user input.  In this way, thus supporting point one.

Any insight or advice would be seriously appreciated.

The short version: 6 weeks ago, her gait has dramatically changed, the numbness has progressed up her legs, and started to attack her bowels and bladder; she's unable to contract her internal muscles presently, and has outer partial numbness. Her legs are weakening, especially her feet. She's reliant on crutches to walk now and is barely able to manage more than maybe 20-40 meters on them, even taking extreme care. She seems to be tiring easily too.

This is still worsening. She's had an MRI, and other than 'elevated liver results' she's apparently all normal, although one neuro said her spine is an odd shape. They're going to perform an EMG tomorrow, but as I understand it, that mainly shows peripheral neuropathy issues and this seems to be a CNS problem. I've watched her knee reflexes change from 'normal' to 'brisk' to 'trying to enter orbit' over the last few weeks, but the neuros seem to think they're 'naturally brisk' and are ignoring our concerns that this is a recent change. Her reflex there now moves her legs further than she herself consciously can.

Her plantar reflex looks to me to be showing Babinski's sign, but I can see her big toe fly upwards and her other toes spread out when the test is performed.

She's in hospital but they're aiming to discharge her at the end of the week or so, ie, 'we don't know what it is so have some physio to help'. We're in England, so the NHS is providing these services. We can't afford private.

I'm seriously concerned that something critical has been missed, or possibly MS, but MS has apparently been ruled out based on the MRI. She also has a lot of pain in her hips and slightly down her inner and outer thighs, which has been the case for a while, but is a lot worse lately. Some upper back ache but nothing major or radiating as I understand it.

Any input would be much appreciated. Honestly I'm seriously scared, they'll most likely try to discharge her in the very near future, eg next few days, and the 'diagnosis' of 'functional disorder' will lock the door on getting her back in, at least until it's likely too late to do anything to genuinely help with whatever the cause is.

AMA (previously posted in cogsci),drsmack1,37,9,14,"One day in 1995 I went to work as normal (USAF) and after being there a while I found that I could not complete most sentences. To everyone else I seemed to be stuttering
I was 25 years old.

It took me about three months to re-learn how to talk. I had to use analogies in speaking to replace the words I no longer had. If someone said one of the words


I had no improvement from this condition until about two years ago

The personality change was a lot more subtle. I lived alone and had no friends, I went from having no friends my entire life to suddenly having people want to hang out with me. I had become the hub of a bunch of friends. I suddenly started having startling success with the opposite sex, at least to the point of bedding women easily. This was after having only one incredibly dysfunctional sexual relationship previously (a few years prior). Women would quickly fall in love with me. Prior to my ""event"" (as I have come to think of it) I would have been considered pretty straight down the line Asperger's (not that I knew what that was or even what Autism was about back then). After the event I suddenly was able to judge social situations and body language. I started just ""knowing things"" based on subtle signs. I found that I was better at this than any of my peers. All good except for the words thing, right? Well, not quite...

The bad: Lost some of my savant-like talents. Started being bad with money; going from debt-free to bankrupt by 1997. Started doing risky things - lots of road rage incidents and ""fools rush in"" kinds of situations. My memories of my past life became foggy and mixed up. New memories were similarly scrambled. Lost some of my sense of smell. Emotional blunting and alexathymia. Became sexually promiscuous and careless. Changes in libido and a shift in sexual interests. Became hyper-sexual (could go in the good or bad column I guess) Lost most interest in personal hygiene and housekeeping. Lost the willpower to control my diet

Now for the strange part (and you thought it was strange already). I found that I now had two separate processes of cognition; the old one and the new one. You see

Any time that a subject or problem would arise

This sort of thing continues to this day, but that had no bearing whatsoever on my behavior. That part of me had become a observer only, a voyeur.

I know what you are wanting to ask: What the F did the doctors say happened? Well
Over the previous 6 years or so

An example would be when I forgot how to drive my stickshift in 1991. Took me a few months before it became natural again.

So I just assumed that the words would just come back in a week or two.

I know of no particular physical event that would explain any of this; but my memory is such that I would not necessarily be able to connect a fall or a car accident to a particular time frame. It is all a big mosh pit of vague connections.

I have experienced more changes since then

Over the last couple of years I have had a lot of medical problems which generally atypical presentations or just plain never before seen. As part of investigating this I have had a MRI and CT of my head. I was surprised when I was told that there were no abnormalities seen whatsoever.
I do have a lot of feelings about all of this. I feel a great sense of loss
My mind is extremely error-prone. I make a near constant stream of mental errors throughout the day. Fortunately my current job does not expose this too much; becoming a brain surgeon is NOT an option.
I have seen a slow decline in what remains of old skills and a regression in some of my post event gains. I fear that in the future I will completely go back to the way I was


I have seen many doctors in the last couple of years. All scans come back negative. Extensive EMG testing comes back with odd results and increased insertional activity in all muscles. Muscle biopsy was abnormal but not enough so to be diagnostic. Many tiny fibers noted. High CK (3x), NASH found on biopsy.


When I take personality type tests
If you were to ask me to emulate a particular personality type when taking the test I would be completely consistent and would be able to skew the test whichever way I needed to.
I believe that some part of my outward personality is emulated. I often have unspoken discussions with other people in my head. I emulate their part in it
I believe that part of the dual intelligence thing is that I have partial access to the subconscious/common sense part of my mind. I used to be wrong about everything in my life; even on subjects I had complete mastery of.
Now that the change happened
Other people's cognitive issues are also obvious to me
Not allowing them to affect my interactions with others makes me difficult to understand for most.
Of course telling anyone that you are only rarely affected by common biases provokes an immediate bullshit from them. Yet it is the case.


Although I have never attended college I do have quite a lot of college credit. I found out that a perk to being in the USAF was that I could take CLEP tests for free. So I started taking them. No studying

This was all before the changes.

I ended up with 40 some credits this way. I was two classes away from an associates degree
Some of the tests I took only because I was mistaken about the subject matter. For example I took Western Civ I because I mixed up east and west (as I usually do) and I thought it was going to be about Europe. I somehow passed it by deconstructing the test and going back and changing 80% of the answers as I went.
I went ahead and took Western Civ II and passed it using the same method.
I also passed English with a 94% for a nice 6 credits. This is despite me struggling in this subject in HS and failing it my Junior year.",,t5_2qu9b,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/neuro/comments/ee5rx/iama_person_who_had_a_sudden_personality_change/

The problem is, and i've covered pretty much all of it before. Talking to the professors confirmed this. One of them suggested I take the bio courses - cancer biology and immunology - which conflict with the neuro courses, and just take the neuro course exams at the end of the period. Another suggested i take advantage of finding the neuro courses easy and focus more on taking some modelling/data analysis classes. The problem is I have a poor math background compared to what is done in these classes (I've done up to calc II, these classes begin with nonlinear dynamical systems), and also I'm not sure where to focus more. 

I'm interested greatly in neuroimmunology, stroke, etc. On the other hand, it seems that computational methods are starting to take the reins in all biological disciplines, especially neuroscience, these days. Based on your knowledge and experience, what would you do in my situation?

I'm NOT seeking a prognosis

I think it's important to give a brief breakdown (timeline) of the situation with this patient to better answer these questions

- Patient (25 y/o female) suffered anaphylactic shock from an allergen.
- Patient administered epi (did not work)
- Patient was seen my EMTs moments later
- Patient went into cardiac arrest (believe heart was brought back in the ambulance)
- Patient entered ER stable
- ER Doctors determined brain was swelling
- Patient was induced into a coma
- Taken off medical coma Sunday (2/24)
- Patient will not awake to-date
- Doctors have done an EEG and all we know is that results ""are not good""
- Patient getting a tracheotomy + on respirator

Questions:

1) Is it realistic to say that a patient's brain will swell only because of lack of oxygen due to a cardiac arrest where he/she did not have adequate O2 supply within the 6-minute mark? And how is this swelling determined in the ER? (CAT scan?)

2) I know there are a ton of tests to determine brain death in adults (http://www.aan.com/professionals/practice/guidelines/pda/Brain_death_adults.pdf)

3) Is coma related to severe-neurological brain injuries? Do people not wake up from comas because of brain trauma/injury? Are there other factors associated for coma victims

-Extreme fatigue. Sleeping until 11 am
-Episodes of blank staring and unresponsiveness
-Complete lack of desire to do anything but sleep. 
- Excessive drooling
- Decreasing frequency of speech. Not answering when spoken to.

 Now I'm not going to mention the ”A” word
-Repetative speech. Saying the same things 20+ times in a row.
- Incessant question asking
- Toe walking
- Episodes of laying on the ground

I documented these changes and staring/unresponsive episodes with my camera. We showed them to his pediatrician after 5 days. We were referred to a neurologist to see him first thing on Monday (we went in on Friday). Monday morning he had another episode of unresponsiveness followed by vomiting. We went to a children's hospital ER. They did an overnight EEG

His symptoms have almost totally gone. We are still following up with the neurologist, could you tell from an EEG even if he didnt have an episode during the EEG? What would cause a developmentally normal, actually advanced, 3 year old to rapidly develop and then recover from these symptoms that so closely mimic the ”A” word. I'm a registered nurse, so I can navigate health literature. I just need a point in the right direction. Anyone? Please?

Edit: Can we please operate under the assumption that I am not an idiot? I realize this isn't a substitute for a neurologist visit and I am not going to let Google and people on Reddit determine his diagnosis and course of treatment. I am only looking to learn and understand what happened while we wait for his neurologist appointment. I have gotten some excellent information as a starting point from here so far, but I am also reasonable.

I could use some wisdom from neuroscientists... (I'm not sure which subreddit to put this in, and I really want to start taking my work and future more seriously. However, since I've never taken much time to actually stop and talk to a neuroscientist about the path that he/she has taken to become a neuroscientist, I find I'm at a bit of a loss when it comes to what I should be doing to adequately prepare me for studying and applying neuroscience.

I've taken a number of neuroscience courses ranging from Cognitive Neuroscience to Neuroanatomy, if I can manage to persuade them to give me some of their time.


I read, so I'm hoping that will point my way.


Maybe some of you could simply share your stories about how or why you became neuroscientists? Or just interested in the topic?


**tl;dr: I'm a nub in college. How does I prepare to be neuroscientist besides classes?**


*EDIT:* I'm very grateful for the feedback everyone has provided and hope it helps other undergraduate neuroscience students. I've begun looking into the books suggested and starting speaking with some professors about their labs. I've looked into some of the books

* Kandel's Principles of Neuroscience
* Research Techniques in Neuroscience by Matt Carter and Jennifer Shieh
* MATLAB for Neuroscientists

**EDIT2:** I've been speaking with professors about working in their labs. The sentiments about programming and mathematics are spot on. A lot of the work being done by the professors I've spoken to so far have to do with oscillatory firing patterns of neuron populations and there is a ton of statistical analysis and sinusoidal techniques that I need to touch up on. Good thing I kept my math books!

Also, as well. And I've heard that Neuroscience by Purve is a nice concise take on things as well. I really feel like I'm getting a solid foundation in neuroscience now! Thanks, everyone!

**EDIT3:** Just wanted to do a quick update. I followed most of the advice in the comments and things worked out very well - so if you are/were in my position, read journal articles, sought out professors, emphasized the strengths I had in the areas everyone here mentioned and I'm still reading a ton as I go and trying to get more and more hands on experience at the same time so I have more pragmatic knowledge.

Because I was writing to think I've split this into three sections for your convenience: background knowledge

---

**Background Knowledge**

In the expertise-acquisition literature it's noted that when expert chess or Starcraft players have their eye movements tracked while playing a game, they've learned to pick up patterns in the structure of the game's advance. These patterns are primarily visual, but represent signposts in the game's progression and thus one can make an educated response to turn the tables to one's favor.

Chess and Starcraft are very complex games. The chess puts a heavy load on deductive reasoning while Starcraft is much more inferential, does not necessarily come from just playing more games. Chess books exist so that case studies can be analysed and to an extent memorized, so that when one comes up against a complicated scenario, by rote one may still win. Similarly with Starcraft and clan wikis.

In some, they move to subconscious instead of conscious processing. This means that experts can do more complex things but are less tired in doing so because subconscious processing is less expensive.

---

**Analysis**

There seem to be three approaches to gaining expertise at a Chess and Starcraft

1) practicing a lot at the level of doing the thing and coming up with your own rules - most costly and requires most smarts: reflection on experience and analysis of experience

2) memorizing patterns and strategies - less costly than (1) and accessible to more people; but also less innovative. You're taking expertise rather than generating it

3) increasing one's motivation and mental energy to be better at (1) and (2).

These are not mutually exclusive

(3) is hardly a crapshoot, and mental energy is cheap - drink caffeine, do exercise, and have a balanced diet that isn't vegan.

What about smarts? It appears that after some difficulty trying

Memorizing facts, Spaced Repetition and Life](http://lesswrong.com/lw/64k/memory_spaced_repetition_and_life/), or [Self-programming through spaced repetition](http://lesswrong.com/lw/5v1/selfprogramming_through_spaced_repetition/).

So is the memorization of key reasoning concepts like Modus Ponens/Modus Tollens, or domain-specific patterns both possible and adequate as a strategy for improving my reasoning ability?

---

**Discussion**

Weaknesses in this analysis include:

* I might suffer from some key points being too general and it could be more effective to look at how to improve my performance at all of the tasks mentioned in the beginning. A deconstruction of these tasks could provide insight on this question anyway. Maybe if it comes up.

* Practicing Chess and Starcraft do not appear to have far transfer to many other except maybe speed of processing. So generalizing the nature of these tasks to other specific activities could be fallacious. However

* Visual recognition and motor response are quite different from devising a program or math proof that works. Word problems don't always have any aside from some keywords

* Given that memorization is an effective method, and long-term memory storage. I doubt this is too much of an issue, but would an overreliance on memorization have any negative consequence on analytic capacity? Are these just a matter of time committed to one improvement strategy over other possible but unknown strategy of analytic improvement?

I'm afraid the above factual claims are going to go uncited until I find the papers again.

Thoughts?

Let's say that Server1 and Server2 are both financial exchange servers running exactly the same algorithms, Server2 is generally preferred by traders – and thus handles most trades – *unless* the number of trades exceeds its bandwidth. In that case, Server1 is very rapidly and overwhelmingly preferred by traders, because it won't impose further delays.

So, but at high #s of trades, Server 2 consumes more energy. This gives us a [Server1 vs. Server 2] x [# of trades demanded] interaction in terms of energy consumed, even though both servers are running the same algorithm.

Now

http://i.imgur.com/RMKjcU8.jpg

Does this mean we can't infer a difference in the cognitive processes implemented by each brain region

------Teaser 2------

Server1 and Server2 are two webservers running Apache 3.2, when the number of client requests are low, Server 1 tends to be involved; when the number of client requests are high, Server 2 is recruited instead. Let's say this occurs because there's a high cost to spinning up Server2's disk, but once spun up it can handle lots of requests very quickly (e.g., it spins at a 54000000RPM).

Finally

This also gives us a Server [1 vs 2] by [# of client demands] interaction in terms of energy used

As before, and energy with PSC. Does this mean that, once again, we can't infer a difference in the cognitive function of these regions, even given the region x effect interaction?

Results from the first EEG:

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation caused abnormal activity, and asleep). 9-10 ""diffuse, transient bursts of delta and theta slowing"" of 1-3 seconds. These were well-formed, quasirhythmic, and of moderate intensity; on a few occasions they were better-formed in the left hemisphere. Most of the episodes were in the theta range of 6-7 Hz with some in the delta range of 2-3 Hz with overriding delta activity.

Is there a nutritional basis to this or possibly something to do with exercise? As it is I put over an hour into meditation and yoga each day .

I'm a Computer Scientist who has been trying to learn more about neuroscience. I've been reading a [textbook](http://www.amazon.com/Neuroscience-Exploring-Mark-F-Bear/dp/0781760038) and some papers/wikipedia articles and there's a concept that confuses me that I'm hoping you guys can help me clarify. I'm not in school anymore and I don't really have access to many resources to just ask questions to so I hope this is ok in this sub.

I've been trying to learn more about the visual cortex (I'm a Machine Vision guy professionally)

When we do computational simulations of ANNs, but this also appears to clash with the idea of neuronal tuning as I've read it (although I may be completely misunderstanding the concept).

I understand ANNs aren't accurate representations of brains

Why do we believe individual cells ""selectively represent a particular type of sensory,"" and is this belief limited to sensory systems like visual and auditory? How does a single cell hold this information (my understanding of neuronal cell structure is limited to what I've read in the aforementioned textbook)? Are there computational models which better represent this idea? I've seen boosting networks, or networks of networks, which represent more complex information or patterns in a subnetwork, but these networks don't abstractly represent a single cell.

Sorry if this seems like a really layman question! I'm still pretty new to neuroscience

Thanks!

However I'm having a lot of my own difficulty related to this, I have no idea why a spike can be defined in the intervals of .86 ms to 2.1 ms (where did these ranges come from? Who tested this?) or how to make pretty plots of the data (why can't I add electrode counts to my Raster plots? I read the Neuroexplorer manual and it tells me nothing. Why am I so retarded? etc.). Literature searches haven't really dug up much help for me and I just feel like I'm not even grasping the most elementary assumptions that I'm supposed to be making while doing my experiments and analyzing the data I have, which undoubtedly will turn out to be poorly done.

Maybe this is a really uninformed question but I can't seem to find a straight answer or figure it out so I'd appreciate an explanation.

So

What determines which neurotransmitter a given neuron will release into a given synapse?

I can think of a few different possibilities
Is it context dependent? Can a neuron release different neurotransmitters into the same synapse depending on the situation? For some reason that sounds unlikely.
Can a given neuron only ever release one neurotransmitter and you just have dopamine neurons and GABA neurons or can a neuron have different neurotransmitters it releases into different synapses but each synapse has a specific neurotransmitter it receives?

What mechanism determines this stuff? Is it genetic? Do neurons with different jobs differentiated and replicate? How does a neuron decide whether this specific corner of my brain needs some stimulation or some cool jazz?

I just want to know if i start heading down this road... am i going to regret it when i need to put food on the table? 

Thanks in advance for any advice

I think of designing a college-level class for High School kids, but I have heard that in many fields (biostatistics, genomics) R is at least as popular as Matlab, or even more popular. Also R is free, which seems to provide certain logistical benefits for the course organization. Still I don't want to teach them something they are not really likely to use in the neuroscience lab later on.

Thus please help me with this mini-poll. If you use Matlab or/and R in your research, if possible, hint at what kind of science you are talking about (fMRI, spike trains analysis, cellular neuroscience?..) It will give me a better perspective of the current state of affairs.

Ive had hundreds of echo's but never did they aggitate waterand push it thru an IV before... so this showed what they think caused the stroke.  A PFO I was told is my new diagnosis.  I made a cardiologist appointment for Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh for Jan. 13 because the neurologist wants me to go where I went for my first heart surgery.  So
They think the PFO is what caused the strokes.

I'm 23/f, cardio exercise 3x per week on average, no smoking, I have a few drinks on the weekend, no elicit drugs, fairly traditional dietary habits, though I try to steer clear of processed foods as much as possible. The only things I have going against me is quite a bit of family history of high cholesterol and related heart attacks/strokes. I was also diagnosed with hypothyroidism (another abnormal issue for someone my age) about a year and a half ago, so I'm very familiar with most scientific/medical jargon. :)

The story (sorry for the detail/length!):
When I was 18 during my first semester at college, the words coming out of my mouth were complete gibberish. My speech was slurred and I felt like I couldn't articulate my thoughts no matter how hard I tried. Next, I started feeling tingling in my right hand. I should also mention that I had a dull headache throughout all of this, but nothing remarkably painful or abnormal. I know at this point I probably should have realized what was going on and gone to the ER, but I was confused and scared, and all my symptoms went away within 30 minutes. I felt completely normal and like nothing had happened at all.

The next day I saw my doctor, MRI with contrast, various blood tests, all of which came back normal. At the time he never used the word ""stroke"", but said it could have been caused by a migraine (although I had never had one before) or some other fluke event. He told me that I should just be mindful of theses symptoms and go to the ER if this were to ever happen again, and then he would refer me to a neurologist for further testing.

So fast forward to last week, and by the time I had decided I needed to go to the ER, my symptoms had completely subsided. I would say the whole event lasted between 1-2 hours. I saw a different doctor (I've since moved across the country), and after I told her my symptoms and my suspicions that these events could be TIAs, she agreed with me and referred me to a neurologist. Unfortunately, the earliest available appointment is in a month, so I have to impatiently wait to find out what's going on. 

I know the MRI ruled out blockages/plaque in the brain, but mostly because I'm curious and find the subject to be fascinating. I also think its always best to be a well informed patient!

So with ALL that said, or articles you might have on the subject of TIAs in young people would be greatly appreciated! :)",,False,,t5_2qu9b,False,,
1360759796.0,18fxc6,Found a neurologist with unconventional techniques. Need help identifying them (x-post from r/skeptic).,Donacius,16,3,21,"Hey guys

Recently my friends have told me about a neurologist in one of the main city hospitals. It appears that this man has, but I cannot really wrap my mind around them. So I figured this is the place to go. The description of his work is rather scarce, because I have not seen him in action and I've only heard rumors from my colleague:

1. He uses magnets. That was the first red flag. He uses them to ""block"" certain parts of the peripheral nervous system during neurological examination
2. A friend said that he examines patients very swiftly, then re-gain it.
3. He claims, causing them to spasm and inducing neurological symptoms. By applying pressure to various points, he can fix those problems, maybe diagnose visceral organ diseases.
4. After googling a bit I've found that he already had his license suspended once, as I've heard, falsifies documents, denies conventional treatment and a lot of other bad bad stuff.

I might pay him a visit to try and see his ""technique"". If I do, I don't really know what should I be reading up about. What he is doing looks like a weird combination (well, I shouldn't be surprised) of magnetic therapy/magnetism, traditional Chinese medicine with visceral organs reflections on the body, but that is it.

What intrigues me is that neurological examination part and induced paralysis or whatever he is doing there. As I said, like pathological reflexes or some other neurological examination refinements that I am not yet aware of? If so, could you guys provide me a source to read up on that? My first thought was something along the lines of the power of suggestion, something that Derren Brown does: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAv7aGamcy4 (even though I'm a bit skeptical of his work too).

I have a Science Essay prize in my school over the holidays and I really want to do a neuroscience one so I can learn more (and hopefully win!). The premise for the essay is simply to write a paper on any scientific or technological subject (about 2000 words). Usually

Is there anything in neuroscience recently or an interesting sub-section that I could write about? That fits into the not-too-complicated-but-sophisticated-enough? I am willing to put in 10-20 hours of research/learning work

I've read a decent amount of cognitive science/consciousness stuff, I'm partial to Dennet, etc.  I'm by no means well-versed, but I have a pretty good grasp of how consciousness works.

I have never found a satisfying explanation of what makes ME, but *why* do they have to end there, at the edge of my skull?  That question leads into: If I had a way to interface perfectly with another brain or a synthetic apparatus that would allow me to, say, see through its ""eyes"" and use its visual processing faculties, could ""I"" consider that part of ""ME""? 

To jump probably way too far next:  If i could likewise interface completely with another ""stand-alone mind"" (a machine that could think and perceive and feel more or less exactly as I can) and I could experience through that one as well as my own anatomy

Obviously I'm just looking for ideas and directions and that's the most I would expect.  And to pre-empt possible comments: I'm not looking for an explanation of the ""self"" and what makes me feel the way I do and have consciousness the way I do - I'm looking for why I can't experience what YOU are experiencing...

The question, we can assume that any neuron in the human nervous system can be linked to any other through a series of connections. Many neurons will be directly connected.

There will be, but rather the number of links you have to go through to get from one to the other.

Does anyone think that this nerve compression can be culprit of my symptoms?

My question is a bit unfortunately put

**I don't want to know whether we react on positive events (such as joy) or negative ones (e.g. fear), through the mirror neurons, and whether the quality of the reaction depends on the quality of the event.**

Two situations be given:

a. A man sees another suffer of violence caused by nature
His mirror neurons become active. Does the man feel pity because he might

- I. suffer in place of the other (negative quality)

- II. not want the other man to suffer for the reason of the other man being (positive)

- III. not want the other man to suffer for the reason of the other man being *a living entity as (1.) / like (2.) himself* (negative)


b. A man sees another enjoying hapiness. His mirror neurons become active. Does the man feel joy because he might

- I. be in the position of the other man (negative)

- II. wants the other man to enjoy happiness for the reason of the other man being (positive)

- III. wants the other man to enjoy happiness for the reason of the other man being *a living entity as (1.) / like (2.) himself* (negative)


As you can see, defined by Jonathan Seglow as having to be neccesarily non-enforced. Of course we could then say it would be not enforced by likelihood but the human mind itself.

_________________________________________________
Why is it that we feel no effort for tasks such as vision (recognition) and that we are good both for top-down and bottom-up reasoning (we can link trajectory interpolation with conscious thinking) ?
I have an hypothesis: I think that the data structures within our brain are better (by far) than the ones we currently use when programming. When programming, or other operations. For instance some data structures have many ""scaffolding"" around the data, but all structures have to be kept up-to-date. I think that our brain has a mega-super-structure like this.

The most basic example is whether we need an array or a (linked) list. Accessing the Nth element of an array is O(1), N times for a simply linked list. On the contrary, adding an element to an array may need more memory and so a new memory allocation and a deep copy. Adding an element to a linked list is easy, allow memory and point on it. Good for insertion/deletion, bad for random access. We have to make a choice. It takes less time to know if an element is inside a set than inside a(n) (unsorted) array or a list but we cannot randomly access the nth element and insertion is longer than for a list.

One illustration of that is simple: consider a NxN 2D map with M items on it. Either you can represent the M items and store their (x, or moving it, is easy, just change its coordinates, but you have to iterate potentially over all items (O(M)) if you want to know which items are on a particular map tile. If you store the items in the tiles, it's quick and easy to know which items are on given tiles, but knowing where is a given item and/or move it is a pain (O(N^2)). You get it. Now, but keeping this pointers structure up to date is quite some work. That's where I think than our brain differ: these kind of tasks seem easy to deal with, that we don't trade memory for processing time or the other way around

1371117423.0,1g9cd1,"I had a transformative experience that cured my depression, inattention, aphasia, motivation &amp; anxiety problems and left me with enhanced senses. Wtf happened?",gibs,14
Background: I've been struggling with (many of the recognised) depressive symptoms, social anxiety and a weird kind of speech thing where I know the word I want is there but I can't access it. Social interactions, creativity and mental faculties all felt like a big cognitive effort for me. This has been going on for all of recent memory, at least since late teens, hard to say about earlier.

Now

So the interesting part of the story came near the peak of my trip, articulate, engaging self and anxious, withdrawn self. I don't feel that I intended or directed this event at the time, it just sort of happened to me. Following this experience I sort of came to, not so much in the usual way of phasing into clarity that I've experienced on this substance; more like awakening from unconsciousness.

Soon after, sort of like going from 240p to 1080p, or taking off a pair of dark sunglasses. I have had similar enhanced sensory effects on this and other psychedelics before, but not quite to this extent and always transitory. It felt almost natural, as though this were the normal capacity of my senses finally being utilised properly. Cognitively I felt confident and alert and very much ""myself"". Not a trace of anxiety.

As I came down, and I feel awesome, despite the lingering effects of opiate withdrawal. I don't feel high at all; completely sober in fact. It's sort of like the experience of cognitive enhancement from taking modafinil, except this is significantly more profound an effect and also feels less like enhancement and more like my faculties operating at full natural capacity (although given the relative change, there is also the enhanced feeling; just different to having taken a stimulant).

Now

List of changes:

- Improved sensory function and clarity (all senses)
- Better mental clarity and energy; memory and attention are much improved
- No longer a big mental effort to generate speech &amp; writing
- Anxiety (social and otherwise) gone
- Far easier to feel pleasure
- Better motor feedback and coordination
- More physical energy
- The desire to take drugs is gone; the interest in psychedelics is still there
- I feel warmer; better circulation to extremities (I had chronically poor circulation)
- Pupils a little more dilated than usual
- Feeling of my head being fully ""pressurised""
- Inattentive problems gone; it's no longer an enormous effort to stay engaged &amp; awake in lectures or conversations
- Motivated
- Easy to form mental associations
- My ongoing problem with grasping for words is gone; I can have long flowy stream of consciousness conversations with no effort now.
- Feeling of being in ""engaged"" mode

Now, always having had a positive, optimistic outlook and maintaining a large number of interests and hobbies.

I have been having a debate with someone and I've taken the position that one stimulus is all that is needed to evoke a decision being made; the decision is to either act on it or to not act on it. The other person thinks that decision-making requires choosing between at least two things. For example, the insect can either choose to go to the light or not go to the light. Through evolutionary processes, it has acquired a certain behavior that says, ""Go towards the light."" Even though the fly will always go towards it, the option of not going towards it still exists. It is merely that one choice now completely dominates because of evolutionary processes. The other person thinks that this is merely a reflex like behavior. *He thinks that if the fly does not go to the light (given the first idea), it is a failure to act rather than the fly choosing to not go to the light.* He thinks that in order for it to be a decision, the fly must choose between two things (i.e. you present the light but at the light source you have a heat source as well; does the fly choose to go to the light or does it choose to avoid the heat source?). The fly would then make its decision based on integrating how hot the heat is versus how attractive the light is.

I'm not an expert in decision theory so I present the people of r/neuro this question. Which definition of decision-making is more accurate? Are they both wrong?

Brain: The medial left temporal lobe is abnormal. It is asymmetrically
enlarged and has high T2/FLAIR signal
hippocampal sclerosis. The left temporal and inferior left frontal cortex is
slightly bright on T2/FLAIR. No evidence of hemorrhage
infarction. The ventricles are normal in size and morphology. There is no
abnormal enhancement.

Soft tissues and marrow: Unremarkable
Face and orbits: Bilateral maxillary sinus mucus retention cysts.

IMPRESSION:

Signal abnormality and enlargement of the left medial temporal lobe. This may
be due to underlying mass, or less likely
a subtle presentation of herpes encephalitis.



I have personally viewed this procedure/exam
changes to it where appropriate.

ROUTINE EEG

Indication: evaluate for epileptiform abnormalities

History: 27 y/o male with new onset seizure on 7/19
with vertigo
convulsion. EEG requested to evaluate for epileptiform
abnormalities. 

Methods:
This study was a Routine EEG with a duration of 29 minutes. The
digital recording was performed with routine electrodes applied
according to the 10-20 electrode placement system. The record
included video
electronically. Automated digital spike and seizure detection
analysis was used
nursing observations. 

EEG Description

Interictal Record: In the maximally awake and alert state
is a well formed
rhythm of 10 Hertz of low amplitude identified. Prominent lower
voltage
Occasional brief
observed over the left temporal region. Two 1-2 second bursts of
sharply contoured
Hertz activity were observed during periods of drowsiness. These
bursts did not show any clear intermixed spikes or slow waves
and were not accompanied by any clinical correlate. No
epileptiform discharges were present. The patient entered the
drowsy state
recorded. Stage II sleep is characterized by symmetric sleep
spindles

Activation: Hyperventilation was performed and produced some mild
diffuse slowing
was performed and produced a symmetric driving response
photoparoxysmal discharges or other abnormal responses. 

Events/Seizures: No events or seizures are recorded. 

EKG: The single-channel EKG recording shows a sinus rhythm. 

Interpretation: This is an abnormal awake and drowsy EEG. The
presence of mild intermittent
over the left temporal region is suggestive of an underlying
physiologic or structural disturbance in this area. No
epileptiform discharges were identified. Additionally
paroxysmal bursts of generalized
sharply contoured theta activity was observed. No intermixed
spike or slow wave activity was present during these bursts to
clearly indicate that they represent an epileptiform abnormality.
This finding is of uncertain significance
bursts of generalized theta activity have been described in some
patients with primarily generalized epilepsy. Clinical
correlation is advised.

INPATIENT NEUROLOGY HISTORY AND PHYSICAL

 is a 27 yo RH man minimal PHMx whom neurology is consulted on for first time seizure. He reports he was getting his allergy shots this AM, like a stalled MAC OS sign in both eyes. This last about 2-3 minutes. He was able to get back to work, sit in his chair and next thing he knew he woke up on the floor.
His friend Don was the event and said he was sitting up in chair and then tightened up and then shook all over. He got him to the floor and he was flailing about. His eyes were looking around, but it felt like ""15"". Pt did not receive any medications to abort seizure. He was throwing up. He reports taking a few minutes to get back to normal. He bit his tongue on the R side, but urinary or stool incontinence. No prior history of convulsions. No history lips smacking, staring, losing tract of time. He is back to normal.
Risk factors: no birth complicated, no family history of seizure, no febrile seizures, no meningitis or encephalitis, or LOC &gt; 30 min
Prior injections okay, pollen, tree and grasses.

* Do the neurons in a mini-column activate because of their inputs or because some other neurons in the same mini-column activated?",,t5_2qu9b,1356245811.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/neuro/comments/15b3so/ask_neuro_why_100_neurons_per_pattern_recognizer/

So, and that class focuses more on the results (which I know I'm interested in) and less on the methods and analysis (which I know less about). If this is your area, what was your analytical and computational background?

My biggest worry is that I do the work to go down this path and discover that I dislike the math more than I like the neuroscience

Your insight is much appreciated!",,t5_2qu9b,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/neuro/comments/13yenb/suitable_background_for_social_and_cognitive/
