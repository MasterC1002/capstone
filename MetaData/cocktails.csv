Hey guys!  It's time for round 2 of Cocktail of the Week.  This week I'm doing another absolute classic.  Perhaps it's THE classic American cocktail: the Sazerac.

[Recipe from Dale DeGroff's *Craft of the Cocktail.*](http://i.imgur.com/Hvzj3.jpg)

[Recipe from Jim Meehan's *PDT Cocktail Book.*](http://i.imgur.com/hvCPk.jpg)

[Recipe from promotional card at Sazerac Bar in New Orlean's](http://i.imgur.com/lHyML.jpg)

Now this is peculiar.  All of the above recipes are very different from one another.  How can that be, but then changed to Rye Whiskey.  Some believe that this is due to a shortage of cognac caused by the [Phylloxera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylloxera) plague wiping out grape production in Europe.  

What all of the recipes seem to agree on is that rye and Peychaud bitters are definitely in this cocktail.  Personally

- 2oz Rye Whiskey

- 4 dashes Peychauds (don't be stingy here)

- Absinthe rinse

- Lemon twist

- Sugar Cube

Muddle a sugar cube into the bitters (perhaps adding a bit of water to encourage dissolution), but that's up to you.)

This time around

**Results**

Good lord do I love this cocktail.  I am a sucker for good Rye whiskey, the rye bite is there to greet you, with the subtle nuances of absinthe behind.  The flavor of Peychauds is also very present, and complements the tiny bit of sweetness from the sugar.  Amazing.  

[Enjoying it in a special glass from the Sazerac Bar in New Orleans](http://imgur.com/RC473.jpg)

**Cheers!**

This is one of the most famous cocktails of the pre-prohibition era, and tastes amazing.  I'm sure most of you have tried this one before,  but if you haven't, make one! you'll thank me.

Got any Sazerac stories?  Any variations on this classic?  Any suggestions for next week's cocktail?  Feel free to comment below

The world seems to be nearing the peak of a long-needed cocktail renaissance and our subreddit is all but defunct. I started this dedicated account to hopefully stay motivated to post often. I am going to try to add meaningful comments to everything I can and (apologies if this gets super annoying

Kapeesh? Here goes the first one:

* **Possible Drink Name**: *Louis Pasteur's Revenge*^1
* **Ingredients:**  

        +  1-1/4 oz. Del Maguey Mezcal Vida (^2)  

        +  3/4 oz. Angostura Bitters (^3)  

        +  1/2 oz. Grapefruit juice (^4)  

        +  1/2 oz. Honey Syrup (^5)  
  
        +  1/2 oz. Heavy Whipping Cream (^6)  

        +  1 whole egg (^7)  

        +  3 drops of Orange Blossom Water (^8)  

        +  Peel of a grapefruit
* **Directions:** In a cobbler shaker *without ice*^9, honey syrup, cream, and egg. Cover the shaker (still *without ice*) and shake vigorously and thoroughly, approximately twice a standard shaking time^10. Open the cobbler, add the grapefruit juice and top with ice, cover and shake even longer and with more vigor than the previous shake. Once your arms feel like they are going to fall off, slide the grapefruit peel down the side of the glass
* **Flavor Notes:** Not for those uninitiated to the self-aggrandizing world of mixologists. If you aren't scared away by the whole egg in your drink, or the OBW's ability to cause a Proustian rush to the time in middle school when you accidentaly dumped an entire bottle of your dad's cheap Brut aftershave on yourself and spent the rest of the day trying not to gag at your Jersey Shore-ready odor....if you still drank the cocktail then I say welcome. You are most likely a cocktail geek.

1354731641.0,14c11h,Cocktail of the Week #1: Last Word,DrammingSpeed,62,10,42,"Hello all!

For a while now, and make/drink it.  I figured what better day to start this endeavor than Repeal Day? So without further ado, I'll start with one of my personal favorites:  The Last Word.

[Recipe from Jim Meehan's PDT Cocktail Book](http://i.imgur.com/8MqlP.jpg)

I'm only including one recipe on this one, a local Gin in Austin, TX.  For Maraschino, I used Luxardo.

What can I say about the Last Word!  A true classic.  The herby flavors from the Chartreuse are tempered by the maraschino and lime, yet it is light on the palette and very drinkable.  

**Variations:**

- Garnish with a Cucumber slice

I love doing this; the fresh aroma of cucumber complements the flavor of this drink very well.

- Jalapeño

Muddle a small slice of jalapeño in the drink before shaking.  Gives the drink a little spice and jalapeno flavor

- The Final Say:  Sub Bourbon or Rye for the gin

Helpful for those who just will not drink gin.

**Cheers Everyone!**  I hope that some of you who haven't ever tried this drink will give it a whirl, go ahead and post them below! See you all next week!

So my goal for this column is to roughly feature the following each month: 2 classic drinks, the Corpse Reviver #2. Given the lengthy treatise on the Manhattan cocktail last week, this week’s post will be briefer. 

**Background**  
I really wonder what it would have been like to live in an era where having a couple of these at breakfast to “revive you”, though I have not come across any solid existence of a #3. This is another classic cocktail that has enjoyed its own namesake revival of late in cocktail bars.  

**Recipes**  
*PDT Cocktail Book*   
* 0.75 oz Beefeater gin  
* 0.75 oz Lillet Blanc  
* 0.75 oz Marie Brizard Orange Curacao (I substituted Cointreau)  
* 0.75 oz lemon juice  
Absinthe rinse  
Shaken on ice

*Savoy Cocktail Book*  
* 1/4 wine glass Lemon Juice (approx. 0.5 oz.)  
* 1/4 wine glass Kina Lillet  
* 1/4 wine glass Cointreau  
* 1/4 wine glass Dry Gin  
* 1 dash Absinthe  
Shake well and strain into cocktail glass

*Links and further reading*  
[Savoy Stomp](http://savoystomp.com/2008/07/28/corpse-reviver-cocktail-no-2/)  
[Cocktail Spirit](http://www.smallscreennetwork.com/video/434/cocktail_spirit_corpse_reviver)  

**Results**  
This is a very refreshing cocktail

**Variations**  
There are a couple interesting variations on the classic Corpse Reviver #2 that I have encountered, the absinthe in the original recipe seems to only contribute to the aroma of the cocktail, so adding some anise flavor could contribute to some pleasant complexity, though I would be cautious of overdoing it.   	
Another variation that I’ve had the pleasure of enjoying is a barrel-aged Corpse Reviver #2. Though hard to remember the exact experience, its color had changed from white to a pleasant light brown. Though not true of all barrel-aged cocktails, this version is definitely something worth trying if you are lucky enough to come across it. 

**Lillet**  
Lillet is a fortified wine, Semillon and Muscadelle) to which citrus liqueurs (made from sweet orange and bitter orange peels) and quinine, the bittering agent present in tonic water, are added. It is actually a rather delicious aperitif, suitable for drinking before dinner on ice. The original Lillet used in many of the cocktail recipes found in *The Savoy Cocktail Book* call for Kina Lillet. Unfortunately, this product no longer exists as the company that produces Lillet decided to reformulate it in 1986 and rename it Lillet Blanc, which is intended to be “fresher, and less bitter”. An alternative Lillet is Cocchi Apertivo Americano

**Cheers!**  
Note: Four of these taken in swift succession will unrevive the corpse again. (quoted from *The Savoy Cocktail Book*)

It was bound to be featured sooner or later, I’d like to have at least one cocktail each month that can be achieved with a basic bar setup. This is going to be a really long one since I love this drink (I had to cut out almost 1/3 to fit the character limit), so go mix yourself a Manhattan, then come back and enjoy. 

**Background**

The most famous and fantastical origin story of this drink is that it was created in 1874 for a party thrown by Winston Churchill’s pregnant mother at the Manhattan Club in New York. Though a nice story, yet least confirmable, history of the Manhattan cocktail comes from William Mulhall, a bartender in New York in the 1880s. He claimed that the Manhattan cocktail was invented by a Broadway saloonkeeper known simply as “Black” in the 1860s, who I envision as a shadowy sorcerer of spirits. It’s a mysterious story, but amazing that this cocktail remains one of the most well-known today.

**Recipes**

*[My preferred Manhattan](http://i.imgur.com/AjdC1.jpg)*:

* 2.5 oz Rittenhouse Rye BIB [bottled-in-bond]

* 1.0 oz Dolin Rouge

* 2 dashes Angostura bitters

Stirred on ice and strained into a coupe glass

Garnished with homemade Montmorency cherries on a pick (in order of consumption): rye+Peychaud’s

Disclaimer: this is a stiff drink as 2.5 oz of 100 proof rye is equivalent to two normal 1.5 oz pour cocktails. I should probably halve this recipe but I can’t help myself. 

*The Savoy Cocktail Book*: 

*Manhattan Cocktail (No. 1)* [originally found in the 1887 edition of Jerry Thomas’ *Bar-tender’s Guide*]

* 2 dashes Curacao or Maraschino

* 1 pony rye whiskey [approx. 1 oz]

* 1 wineglass vermouth (mixed) [approx. 2 oz

* 3 dashes Angostura bitters

* 2 lumps of ice

Shaken on ice and strained into a claret glass 

Garnished with a quarter of a slice of lemon in the glass

Two dashes of gum syrup optional

*Manhattan Cocktail (No. 2)*

* 1 dash Angostura bitters

* 2/3 Canadian Club whiskey

* 1/3 Ballor Italian vermouth

Shaken on ice and strained into a cocktail glass

Garnished with cherry

*Links and further reading:*

[Robert Hess’ Cocktail Spirit](http://bit.ly/XeHLCr) – he does a rather poor job stirring here for reasons unknown

**Results**

If I were forced to choose only one cocktail to have the rest of my life, but that first sip is like slipping into a custom-tailored suit. You remember how well it fits and how comfortable it is. The initial note is always the spiciness of the rye whiskey, which immediately matures into the fruitiness of vermouth that tames the drink, and evolves into the herbal and bitter notes provided between the vermouth and Angostura bitters. My garnish being three distinct cherries just adds upon the complexity of this drink. The first cherry being soaked in rye whiskey+Peychaud’s complement and amplify the spiciness of rye and briefly take this drink in the direction of a Sazerac. The spiced rum and cinnamon chip soaked cherry turns it exotic with the strong flavor of cinnamon playing a harmonious counterpoint to the cloves in Angostura bitters. Near the end of the drink I enjoy the amaretto soaked cherry, with its naturally complementary flavors. It provides a sweet finish to my drink and reminds me that one is probably enough. 

**Variations**

There are countless variations on a Manhattan cocktail; I’ll briefly go over a few here. The most common variation on a classic Manhattan is using bourbon in place of rye, according to Dale DeGroff in *The Craft of the Cocktail*, is common in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The “Perfect Manhattan”, unfortunately not a literal epitome, is a Manhattan whose vermouth portion is equal parts of sweet and dry. Recently, artisanal distillers have started to put out unaged “white dog whiskey” aka moonshine.  A “White Manhattan” is often a Manhattan cocktail made with “white dog whiskey”, dry vermouth, and garnished with a lemon twist resulting in a clear cocktail that is Manhattan-inspired. I am personally not a fan as I find it barely has any resemblance to the flavor profile of a Manhattan cocktail

**On Cherries**

Grocery store “maraschino cherries” in the United States are vile and as with many cocktail stories, were originally made from Marasca cherries sweetened and preserved in Maraschino liqueur, also made from Marasca cherries. Marasca cherries, native to Europe, are sour cherries, along with the Morello and Montmorency. In 1906, the USDA defined a Maraschino cherry as thus. Sweet cherries, were being grown in the United States and preserved in a similar fashion

When Prohibition was enacted in 1920

By 1940, the original dye, Red Number 4, was banned in 1960 for having lethal toxic effects on dogs and only allowed for the “maraschino cherry” as they are technically not considered a foodstuff. Although the modern “maraschino cherry” is usually dyed with Red Number 40, I still wonder why bleach all the flavor and natural texture out of a cherry then reintroduce it in the form of sugar and artificial dye?

In summary, they are preserved by chemical brine rather than alcohol. Thirdly, they are packed for storage in sugar syrup rather than maraschino liqueur. Finally, they are dyed with synthetic food dye, which may turn out to be toxic.

At this point, which I personally have not had the luxury of trying, is to purchase the Luxardo brand of Maraschino cherries, which to my knowledge are still produced from Marasca cherries, though not kept in Maraschino liqueur. The second, more budget-friendly option that I have found is to purchase the “Dark Morello Cherries in Light Syrup” from Trader Joe’s. I feel these are significantly better than the “maraschino cherry” as they are at least produced from a sour cherry variety and aren’t artificially dyed. The third, more creative option that I have indulged in, which again can be found at Trader Joe’s. All I do is put them in a clean jar and cover them with my liquor of choice. There’s no limit to what you could use to flavor them, cognac

**Manhattan Crimes**

I initially wrote in my outline that the greatest sin you can commit while making a Manhattan is to shake it. I am confident in saying that the great majority of people would agree with this sentiment. Seeing [Robert Hess’ explanation](http://bit.ly/On071t) as to how unacceptable it is was a formative moment in my cocktail education. Yet, but if anybody is daring enough to give it a shot, let me know in the comments.  

I had a friend who, I would argue that this eventually detracts from the drink as the ice melts and the drink is diluted. Unlike an Old-Fashioned, the Manhattan already has sweet vermouth to tame the fire of the whiskey, and thus I feel that the addition of ice is unneeded. Ultimately, I am more a proponent of drink what you enjoy, so if you enjoy your Manhattan on the rocks, I respect that. 
 
**Cheers!**

Hello

Sorry I have been on hiatus, without further ado, let's make the French 75, a cocktail which, according to Harry Craddock, ""hits with remarkable precision,"" like the 75mm artillery gun for which it was named.

**Recipe: Jim Meehan's PDT Cocktail Book:**

1oz Tanqueray Gin

.5oz Lemon Juice

.5oz Simple Syrup

Shake with ice and strain into a chilled coupe.  Top with 1oz Moët Imperial Champagne.  Garnish with a lemon twist.

**Recipe: Dale DeGroff's Craft of the Cocktail:**

1 ounce brandy

3⁄4 ounce Simple Syrup

1⁄2 ounce fresh lemon juice 

Champagne

Shake the first three ingredients well with ice and strain into a goblet with ice. Top with Champagne.

**My Recipe:**

1oz Cognac

.5oz Lemon Juice

.5oz Simple Syrup

2oz Champagne/Sparkling Wine

Shake first three ingredients, garnish with lemon twist.

**Results**

varied set of recipes, I use brandy, because it gives you a sweeter drink, which I like here.  Gin gives you a dryer, lighter affair.  DeGroff says the original was made with gin, but it became more popular with brandy.  Ultimately, your personal preference will have to reign supreme.  Make it both ways

I adore this cocktail.  In my opinion, and simple.  This drink is light and effervescent, thanks to the champagne bubbles.  An extremely palatable cocktail, this is a good one to introduce your less experienced friends to the art of classy alcoholism.

Here is what mine sort of looks like: [French 75](http://ajanaku.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Cocktail_French-75.jpg) (image from ajanaku.com)

**Variations**

This one has some fun variations.  For starters, flame the lemon peel or don't.  If you'd like a different flavor, here's a fun one from DeGroff:

**FRENCH 95**

3⁄4 ounce bourbon

3⁄4 ounce Simple Syrup

1⁄2 ounce fresh lemon juice

1 ounce fresh orange juice

Champagne

Shake the first four ingredients with ice and strain into an ice- filled goblet. Top with Champagne.

This one is tasty.  Bourbon is a welcome guest to the party.  I like to use big

Another week (several this time around

Cheers!

1373228601.0,1htiba,Moscow Mule: Origins,chalks777,39,5,24,"The story of the Moscow Mule (recipes in comments) starts back in the late 1800s with a company named Heublein

At some point John Gilbert Martin,000.  Which according to [this](http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm) is approximately the same as $231,292 today.  Not really a staggering sum for a brand that is now virtually ubiquitous in American culture.  Why so cheap?  The Smirnov (yes, v) family moved to America in 1917 when they were forced to flee Russia during the [October Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Revolution).  While there, Vladimir Smirnov met a man named Rudolph Kunett and in 1933, sold him the right to produce Smirnoff in America.  It sucked.  Nobody liked it.  That's how John got it for the value of the distilling equipment five years later.

There's just one more thing we need to know about.  The Cock 'n Bull.  The Cock 'n Bull was a [bar](http://imgur.com/M049bq2) in Hollywood.  The owner, it seems apparent that John met Jack at the Cock 'n Bull at some point shortly after acquiring Smirnoff.  Remember this is all on the west coast.

Now all the elements are in place to understand the Moscow Mule.  The story goes like this:

&gt;The mule was born in Manhattan but ""stalled"" on the West Coast for the duration. The birthplace of ""Little Moscow"" was in New York's Chatham Hotel. That was back in 1941 when the first carload of Jack Morgan's Cock 'n' Bull ginger beer was railing over the plains to give New Yorkers a happy surprise... Three friends were in the Chatham bar, president of Cock 'n' Bull Products and owner of the Hollywood Cock 'n' Bull Restaurant; one was John G. Martin, president of G.F. Heublein Brothers Inc. of Hartford, Conn., and the third was Rudolph Kunett, president of the Pierre Smirnoff, Heublein's vodka division. As Jack Morgan tells it, nibbling an hors d'oeuvre and shoving toward inventive genius"". Martin and Kunett had their minds on their vodka and wondered what would happen if a two-ounce shot joined with Morgan's ginger beer and the squeeze of a lime. Ice was ordered

It comes from a July 28th, reporter Aline Mosby tracked down a man named Wes Price… the head bartender for Cock 'n Bull.  When asked how the Moscow Mule was invented he had this to say, ""I just wanted to clean out the basement.  I was tryin' to get rid of a lot of dead stock.  Cock n'Bull ginger beer that we made and 100 cases of **vodka that we had to buy then in order to get other liquors**"" (emphasis mine, from [this article, pdf](http://www.fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%208/Schenectady%20NY%20Gazette/Schenectady%20NY%20Gazette%201951%20Grayscale/Schenectady%20NY%20Gazette%201951%20Grayscale%20-%203981.pdf#xml=http://www.fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&amp;u=ffffffffccdcfeeb&amp;DocId=2830629&amp;Index=Z%3a%5cIndex%20O%2dG%2dT&amp;HitCount=8&amp;hits=90b+90c+ad7+ad8+ae4+ae5+136a+136b+&amp;SearchForm=C%3a%5cinetpub%5cwwwroot%5cFulton%5fNew%5fform%2ehtml&amp;.pdf)).  As an aside, my favorite point from that article is when Wes is talking about the price, ""Several thousand mugs are stolen per year … so we had to raise the price … from 70 to 75 cents""

Anyways, but that Jack Morgan used Wes' recipe… the head bartender in his restaurant.  In that same article We said ""I never got an extra cent for my invention, I wasn't truly appreciated.""  Disgruntled employee trying to take credit for something his boss did?  I doubt it.

So, vodka.  The earliest ad I found for it was in [1950](http://imgur.com/PLxvtZO).  Pretty cool looking mule.  The next ad I found that referenced the drink was in [1958](http://imgur.com/9JVDkCT).  Both were from Life magazine.  I also found a neat reference to the cocktail in [1947 NY Morning Herald (pdf)](http://www.fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2011/Gloversville%20NY%20Morning%20Herald/Gloversville%20NY%20Morning%20Herald%201947%20Grayscale/Gloversville%20NY%20Morning%20Herald%201947%20Grayscale%20-%203738.pdf#xml=http://www.fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&amp;u=3f317332&amp;DocId=6490183&amp;Index=Z%3a%5cIndex%20U%2dF%2dP&amp;HitCount=2&amp;hits=14b1+14b2+&amp;SearchForm=C%3a%5cinetpub%5cwwwroot%5cFulton%5fNew%5fform%2ehtml&amp;.pdf):

&gt;Two couples who swear it wasn't the alcohol… sued a bottling company for $10

Ha.

Now, but it has a habit of suddenly whacking you between the eyes and causing you to walk swiftly away on your kneecaps.""  He goes on to say ""It [Bloody Mary] is not, however, quite so unthinkable as the Moscow Mule.""  Which gains extra weight when you realize he describes a Bloody Mary as ""a nauseous blend""

Personally, I started making what the internet at large refers to as ""Mississippi Mules""… the same thing, but with gin instead of vodka.  The flavors imparted by the gin elevated the drink a great deal.  While researching I also found that some people would create ""Kicking Mules"" which is the same as a Moscow Mule, but with the addition of bitters.  Combining those two ideas into a Kicking Mississippi Mule is probably the best thing I've done with a cocktail.  Do you like gingersnap cookies?  Because that's what this cocktail tastes like.  EXACTLY.  [Here are two variations I made](http://imgur.com/a/dRWHo)

I'm going to commit the ultimate act of blasphemy and say that I don't like the classic martini, it tastes too much like pure gin.  Orange bitters are only a tiny improvement.  I think olives taste vile, and while I've never tried a Gibson, I don't think an onion is going to suddenly make me love it.  The only configuration I can say I enjoy is to go heavy on the bitters only use a barspoon's worth of vermouth (or even less), but by that point it's basically a pink gin.

I’m going to give a shot at taking over this weekly cocktail feature and use it as a platform to showcase new cocktails that I’ve come across and enjoyed. This week’s cocktail is the Bobby Burns cocktail
  
**Background**  
The Bobby Burns cocktail is named after the Scottish poet Robert Burns
  
**Recipe**  
There are a few recipes that you can find online
* 1/2 Scotch whiskey  
* 1/2 Italian vermouth  
* 3 dashes Benedictine  
Stirred on ice and strained  
Garnish with a lemon peel

[Recipe from Imbibe](http://www.imbibemagazine.com/Bobby-Burns) (the modern cocktail magazine

He also recently [married]( http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/31/fashion/weddings/audrey-saunders-and-robert-hess-vows.html) Audrey Saunders
  
**Results**  
For my first attempt at this I went with what was currently my only scotch whiskey, which I enjoy as a nicely balanced example of scotch. Disclaimer: I made a cocktail from a single malt scotch, but I recently moved and am still in the process of restocking my bar so I worked with what I had. For the Italian vermouth aka sweet vermouth, I stuck to my usual, Dolin Rouge, which I find is a relatively mild and slightly herbaceous vermouth. Benedictine was obviously Benedictine, but I used 1 barspoon of it as I don’t have a good way to dash from the full sized bottle and I’m pretty confident that isn’t intended.   
It was a great cocktail, brininess and smokiness of scotch on the finish. I did find that 1 barspoon was a little too much Benedictine, so I would recommend a scant barspoon to anyone measuring with a barspoon.   
I also went out and bought a bottle of Chivas Regal 12, and it was just as delicious. I had a friend comment that this sounded like a Manhattan, which is my go-to cocktail, but it’s probably halfway between that and a Rusty Nail, which is probably why I enjoyed this cocktail so much.  
  
**Variations**  
As seen in the *Imbibe* recipe, give it a shot.  
Another variation that I have considered, which shares a similar flavor profile to Benedictine, and is having somewhat of a resurgence in popularity. Both Drambuie and Benedictine are sweet liqueurs with honey, herbs and spices. Drambuie is whiskey-based, while Benedictine is cognac-based, so perhaps Drambuie could potentially fit even better.  
  
**Cheers!**  
Hope you’ve enjoyed adding or rediscovering this classic scotch-based cocktail. Sorry, I’ll definitely get a picture for next week. Share your thoughts with me below. ",,False,self,t5_2qpco,1357778141.0,,

* step 1: try to find a classic cocktail that meets the (color) criteria.
* step 2: substitute bad ingredients with good ones
* step 3: layered drinks are usually gimmicky, to add color, use flavored ice cubes (like the aviary does), or foams or garnishes (see 'artisan cockails' by scott beattie)
* step 4: add lemon or lime to balance the sweet.  usually 1/2 oz for every 1 oz of liqueur.

example:

captain america.  three separate drinks:

* top layer: 2 parts gin 1 part blueberry syrup 1 part lime
* middle layer: 1 part gin 1 part dolin blanc
* bottom layer: 2 parts gin 1 part raspberry syrup 1 part lemon

shake the three drinks separately with ice, tarragon, basil, etc), swap out some of the syrup with a liqueur or an amaro, add bitters etc.  

god of thunder.  i don't have any experience with mead.  but i would guess that all that's needed to fix that drink is a 1/2-3/4 oz of lemon.  maybe swap in some aquavit instead of vodka if you want to beat a dead reindeer with the nordic theme.

iron man.  by some miracle, at least.

the hulk.  obviously needs an overhaul.  if the idea is to have a green drink, or basil.

Ultimately it comes down to style, and the Parisian shaker simply exudes it.

*[Hawthorne Strainer](http://www.amazon.com/OXO-1058016-SteeL-Cocktail-Strainer/dp/B0000DAQ93)* - Used for straining shaken drinks, make it a Hawthorne strainer.

*[Julep Strainer](http://www.amazon.com/Excellante-SLJS031-Julep-Strainer/dp/B001VZAMPQ)* - The julep strainer resembles a big slotted spoon. A julep strainer is used for stirred cocktails

*[Double Strainer \(Tea strainer\)](http://www.amazon.com/OXO-Good-Grips-3-Inch-Strainer/dp/B001713L84)* - Rarely used by itself, or even ice shards from a heavily shaken cocktail, the tea strainer greatly improves presentation and texture.

**Measuring and Pouring**

*[Jigger](http://www.amazon.com/Double-Cocktail-Jigger-Set-Sizes/dp/B001TQ8LO6)* - Because pretenders free-pour. The jigger is a classic way to measure out ingredients for your cocktail. You can save space with a [demarcated jigger](http://www.amazon.com/OXO-3105000-SteeL-Double-Jigger/dp/B0036X4YOG)

*[Measuring Cup](http://www.amazon.com/OXO-Good-Grips-Angled-Measuring/dp/B000ON555S)* -  Among the pragmatic

*[Liquor Pourer](http://www.amazon.com/Spill-Stop-Plastic-Liquor-Pourers/dp/B00125NOSC)* - More often seen in busy bars, and [some pourers measure for you](http://www.amazon.com/Measured-Bottle-Pourer-Auto-Measuring-Set/dp/B002PH0LF0).

**Stirring and Muddling**

*[Bar spoon](http://www.amazon.com/Mixing-Spoon-Stainless-Steel-Removable/dp/B000HBOKIA)* - A long spoon with a shallow head, occasionally measuring an ingredient or two. [Properly stirring a drink](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npsGOmzfTw8) is a skill, but the twisted handle will help you get the hang of it (straight handles are also available if that's your preference). The biggest choice in the spoon is what goes on the end. You can get a weight or disk for muddling, a fork for fishing out garnishes, or simply a decorative tip.

*[Muddler](http://www.amazon.com/Wooden-KegWorks-Cocktail-Bar-Muddler/dp/B001CDO9QA)* - Muddlers are basically sticks for crushing fruits and herbs in your glass. Wood muddlers are classic

*[Swizzle](http://www.cocktailkingdom.com/product-p/oth_swizzlestx_0000_reg.htm)* - Far from necessary

*[Straws](http://www.amazon.com/Cocktail-Stir-Straws-Count-Black/dp/B001DI2UWE)* - Anything you serve with ice benefits from having a straw to stir with as you nurse your drink. Long [drinking straws](http://www.amazon.com/Boardwalk-50PBLK-Plastic-Swizzle-Unwrapped/dp/B004NEW8RM) are a must for Collins' and Fizzes.

*[Mixing Glass](http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/4405916/)* - A spouted glass with or without a stem, though, since you can stir just fine in a pint glass.

**Odds and Ends**

*[Ice Cube Trays](http://www.amazon.com/Tovolo-Perfect-Cube-Tray-Dark/dp/B000QIU7X6)* - Never underestimate the importance of ice when making cocktails. Not only does ice make your drink cold, but the ice cubes from your fridge work just as well. [Oversized ice cubes](http://www.amazon.com/Tovolo-KING-Cube-Trays-Blue/dp/B00395FHRO) are perfect for keeping Old Fashioned style drinks chilly without them getting too watery.

*Juicer* - For a lot of drinks, and oranges by hand is annoying, messy, wastes juice, and doesn't get any of the oils from the skin out. I prefer a press style juicer. The best I've found for a home bar is an aluminum-built juicer called a ""Wear-Ever"" juicer. You can find it on [Ebay for about $20](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=wear+ever+juicer).

*[Channel Knife](http://www.amazon.com/OXO-Good-Grips-Lemon-Zester/dp/B00004OCJO)* - Helps you cut those long beautiful twists that make great garnishes for all sorts of drinks.

*Knife and Cutting Board* - For slicing fruit.

*[Vegetable Peeler](http://www.amazon.com/OXO-Good-Grips-Pro-Y-Peeler/dp/B0000DAQ5E)* - For when you need a peel as garnish. I prefer the Y-peelers

*[Blender](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GQWL7O)* - This can come in handy for making frozen margaritas, which tends to wreak havoc on lesser models.

*[Lewis Bag](http://www.cocktailkingdom.com/product-p/oth_lewisbagxx_0000_ckx.htm)* - For the traditionalist, or you can go all the way and invest in a [wooden mallet](http://www.amazon.com/Crown-106-Beechwood-Mallet-2-Inch/dp/B002S0OIW6).

This week’s cocktail is my monthly foray into the modern world of cocktails, with a little more planning, I think I will be able to showcase some very interesting and creative cocktails. This month’s is a little on the simple side, but it does have some great flavors that might ward off some of the bitter cold that many have been experiencing lately. 

**Background**  
As a modern cocktail

**Recipe**  
From the *PDT Cocktail Book*  
* 2 oz cognac (I used Remy Martin VSOP)   
* 0.5 oz Bénédictine  
* 0.25 oz Fernet Branca   
Stirred on ice

**Results**   
The Montgomery Smith is an interesting blend of fruitiness from the cognac, but this one does it admirably. 
 
**Variations**  
I have considered making this with Laird’s in substitute for the cognac

**Bénédictine**  
As the most recent liqueur added to my bar, it is unclear how much of this story is simply a clever marketing tool. Regardless, we are told that the monk Dom Bernardo Vincelli wrote down the recipe for Bénédictine in 1510 and was rediscovered in 1863 by Alexandre Le Grand, a collector of religious art. The monk’s work dealt primarily with different aspects of alchemy, so I guess they are making allusions to Bénédictine being an attempt at the elixir of life.   
The recipe for Bénédictine remains very well guarded as a trade secret, providing a sweet celery flavor; hyssop, which has a minty flavor tempered with bitterness and is also used in green chartreuse; and lemon balm, giving citrus flavors with mint undertones. The process of producing Bénédictine is rather complicated for a liqueur, starting with 4 separate distillates that are individually aged for 3 months before being blended together and aged again for 8 months. The final step is to add honey and saffron before heating and aging for a final 4 months.  
Of course such an exceptional product must have the proper terroir for aging

**Cheers!**  
Hopefully between the [Bobby Burns](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/169jv7/cocktail_of_the_week_3_bobby_burns/) and this, you won’t regret it.

**Tonic**

I originally discovered good tonic when trying to find smaller bottles for my stronger home-brewed beers (barleywines, which can be 10%+ in alcohol (with the calories to match), and for which 6oz is an ample serving.  After realizing that empty bottles were $1/bottle, I saw that fancy tonics were only slightly more expensive, and when I tried them, I realized that not only did the small bottles of tonic take standard crown crimp caps, but that the tonic inside was well worth the money.  All of a sudden, not because of the drink.  Good tonic makes the drink!


Tonic is normally the largest part of your G&amp;T.  Don't go cheap on this; remember that tonic is the vast majority of a good gin and tonic, or other such brands.  Go into any decent liquor store, or any larger grocery store, and you should be able to find at least one, hopefully several, brands of ""premium"" tonic.  Read the labels!  If the label says ""corn syrup"", don't buy; you're looking for cane sugar, or something similar.  Likewise, you can find them for $1-2/serving, but again




**Gin**

You don't need anything fancy for gin.  Feel free to try fancy/premium gins, here's the place.  Trade down to a middle-shelf  gin or slightly below, and spend the extra buck you saved on tonic.  It's worth it!

I like Seagrams Distiller's Reserve gin for cheap gin, feel free, but I would argue that anything much over $20/5th (muich better than, say, Tanqueray level of quality) is going to be hard to discern to all but the most discriminating palettes.




**Garnishes and juices**

1335968442.0,t3ajq,[Cocktail of the Week] Week 10 - Tom Collins,therationalpi,29,5,17,"Any drink that has [glassware named after it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collins_glass) is worth knowing, topped with seltzer

**History**

The first recipe for the Tom Collins can be found in Jerry Thomas' ""The Bartender's Guide, the Tom Collins featured a good deal more lemon juice (though modern day recipes for the [Gin Fizz](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/pe8oc/cocktail_of_the_week_week_6_the_gin_fizz/) remove this distinction) and used the sweeter Old Tom Gin.

While the inspiration for the mix was known

&gt;""My name is John Collins

&gt;Corner of Conduit Street

&gt;My chief occupation is filling brimmers

&gt;For all the young gentlemen frequenters there.""

The eponymous cocktail, using aged genever gin instead of the Old Tom for a decidedly different character. This story was accepted for decades, until a few years ago when it was debunked by a much more likely story.

""The Great Tom Collins Hoax of 1874"" is a well documented hoax of exposure. One person would prank his friend by asking ""Have you seen Tom Collins?"" and then proceeding to send them to find this imagined person who was looking for them. It was the 1874 equivalent of ""is your refrigerator running?"" Thus

Historically, after which the drink was named, disappeared in the mid 20th century. For decades the Tom Collins was made with London Dry Gin, requiring extra simple syrup to replicate the sweetness. Old Tom Gin earned something of a mythical status, sometimes being referred to as ""The Missing Link."" That is, until Hayman's Old Tom Gin was reintroduced in 2007 based on a recipe from the turn of the century. Since then, even more Old Tom's have resurfaced

**Ingredients**

The Tom Collins is essentially a hard sparkling lemonade

*2 oz Old Tom Gin*

*3/4 oz Fresh lemon juice*

*3/4 oz Simple syrup*

*5 oz Seltzer*

**Making the Tom Collins**

Add gin, add ice and seltzer. Top with the gin and lemon mixture, and garnish with a citrus wedge or cherry.

**Variations**

* The Collins is an entire class of cocktails. A Collins consists of a base spirit, and seltzer served on ice (the ice is considered by some to be the distinction between a Collins and a Fizz). Every base spirit you can think of has its own name.

* 1/2 oz of Maraschino can replace some of the simple syrup for a fresh variation.

* A splash of triple sec can add some complexity to the drink.

* Pureed fruit can be added for a sweet and refreshing variation

* If you really have to, to maintain the sweetness.

I’m glad that I have this weekly column to write about my home cocktail experiences as it has spurred me to finally finish making my homemade allspice liqueur
Instead I figured that it would be clever to feature it for Chinese New Year, the Lion’s Tail cocktail seemed like an well-named cocktail for this week.  

**Background**  
The Lion’s Tail originates from the 1930s, featuring pimento dram aka allspice liqueur, which I will discuss in more depth below. The name of this cocktail likely stems from a reference to “twisting the Lion’s tail”, serving as a warning during the era of British colonialism to avoid causing trouble lest the Lion (Britain) come roaring down on you. The combination of ingredients from former British colonies such as Jamaica (rum/lime/allspice) and America (bourbon whiskey), might be a playful jab befitting this cocktails name.  

**Recipe**  
* 2 oz bourbon  
* 0.5 oz allspice dram  
* 0.5 oz fresh lime juice  
* 1 dash Angostura bitters  
* 0.25-0.5 oz 1:1 simple syrup to taste  
Shaken on ice

My best recipe using homemade allspice dram (your results may vary)  
* 2.5 oz Elijah Craig 12  
* 0.5 oz allspice dram  
* 0.75 oz lime juice  
* 0.5 oz simple syrup 1:1  
* 2 dashes Angostura bitters

This is a very interesting cocktail, but given that the base of pimento dram is white rum, it somehow manages to pull the flavors together. This cocktail is at first very clearly a sour, the lime being the first flavor to hit your mouth. Bourbon provides a strong backbone to carry the cocktail into its unique bitter and spicy flavor comprised of the Angostura bitters mixing with the additional allspice and potentially cinnamon of the pimento dram. Ultimately I experience a rather lingering finish reminiscent of the flavors you have after sipping on some hot apple cider or mulled wine.  

**Pimento Dram and DIY**  
Pimento dram is a liqueur made by infusing white rum with allspice berries and is most commonly featured in tropical tiki style drinks. Allspice is the dried unripe fruit of the Pimenta dioica tree, nutmeg, and clove. Perhaps in respect to its origins, allspice liqueur is commonly referred to as pimento dram, though it runs the risk of being confused with the pimento cherry pepper used in pimento stuffed olives. Perhaps we should start referring to it as pimenta dram instead?  
As I mentioned in the beginning of this article, but I went with this [post]( http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/02/diy-allspice-dram-make-your-own-st-elizabeths-pimento-dram-recipe.html) from Serious Drinks as it was my original introduction to this ingredient and served as my inspiration to making it.  The Serious Drinks recipe makes about 3 cups of pimento dram, which seemed excessive to me, so I scaled it down and my recipe for a smaller volume, approx. 4 oz total, is below:  
* 4 oz light rum (I used Flor de Cana Extra Dry
* 2 tbsp whole allspice berries  
* 1/4 cinnamon stick  
Crush allspice berries (I didn’t have a mortar and pestle but found that my mixing glass and muddler were more than up to the task) and infuse in the rum for 4 days shaking it once daily. On day 5, then follow it up by straining it through a coffee filter. At this point, I found that a significant amount of the original rum basically was soaked up in the allspice berries so despite starting with 4 oz of rum, my final infused product was only approximately 2 oz. I also ended up halting my project at this point for about 2 months, which may help mellow out the flavors, but I did finish it earlier this month by adding an equal volume of brown sugar syrup, made by dissolving an equal volume of brown sugar in water. I ended up with a small jar of pimento dram, which I imagine are sweeter than my attempt. 

**Cheers!**  
If you have a bottle of pimento dram, it is really rather simple and is worth giving a shot. I know this ingredient is definitely not found in most home bars, so next week’s post will be something simpler. Hope you enjoyed this week’s column, let me know how your Lion’s Tail went or your favorite cocktails using pimento dram in the comments below.

Lime cordial began in the 19th century as a way for sailors to preserve lime juice that could be consumed on long voyages to hold off scurvy. In essence it was simply a mixture of lime juice

**Lime Cordial**

* 6 limes (enough for 1/2 cup of juice)
* 3/4 cup granulated sugar

Zest the limes and save the peels. Don't worry about getting some of the bitter pith as it will actually perk up the resulting syrup a bit. Juice the zested limes and strain the juice into a saucepan. Add sugar and simmer for ~20 minutes. Let the syrup cool for 5 minutes

While a gimlet is the classic use for lime cordial, Dying and Dead Bastards](http://www.cocktailmusings.com/2010/05/suffering-bastard.html), to classic drinks from the [Cocktail Database](http://www.cocktaildb.com/), including this little number:

**[Limey Cocktail](http://cocktailchem.blogspot.com/2012/04/homemade-lime-cordial.html)**

* 1 oz light rum
* 0.75 oz lime cordial
* 0.5 oz orange liqueur
* 0.25 oz lime juice

Combine all ingredients

While this drink calls for light rum

The nose is dominated by the vegetal funk of the rhum agricole, this quickly transitions to snappy lime juice and the alcoholic bite and funky pear flavors of the rhum. There's a bit of lingering bitter sweetness from a combination of the rhum and syrups, making it interestingly more-ish.

**The Flavors**

If you want a fall cocktail, nutmeg, apple, cinnamon, hazelnut, nuts, rosemary, caramel, but this is what jumped to mind for me. Note that a lot of those are ""Warm"" flavors and spices, although the fragrance of orange peel still makes a great accent.

**The Strength**

In my opinion, and calvados (applejack)* all match well with the season, and happen to blend well with the flavors I mentioned before.

**Liqueurs of choice**

Here are a few mixers to consider when making fall cocktails:

*Frangelico* - Brings a rich hazelnut flavor to any drink.

*Amaretto* - The sweet almond flavor really matches the season well.

*Goldschlager (or other cinnamon spirit)* - Not to be overused

*Creme de Cassis* - Blackcurrant is passingly similar to cranberries

*Sloe Gin* - Similarly

*Creme de Violette* - A floral flavor that somehow doesn't intrude of the sense of season

*Grand Marnier* - The bitter orange tempered with rich brandy makes this more than appropriate for the season.

*Averna* - Potentially...I can't speak personally for it

Now I make several large batches of cordial every summer and drink it with soda water in addition to in cocktails. The other night I was halfway through and began thinking about the process more than usual. Afterward spent the night researching deeper and came up with some interesting recipes and even theorycrafting. I found the results interesting enough to share and I still have some unfinished thoughts and unanswered questions as well.

At the end of the night my conclusions and questions are

* What makes lime cordial different from the juice and syrup that's improperly substituted in some cases is that cordial has juice, and time instead of just sugar and juice.

* Heat is used primarily to make sugar dissolve better

* Heat causes citric acid to break down. (What else does it change? Is the overall effect positive? Does added citric acid improve the flavor afterward?)

* Added water helps the sugar dissolve as well. (Does water have ANY beneficial effect in the finished product? My cordial with water is still pretty strong so maybe it helps with portioning.)

* The zest's essence is extracted by the acids of the juice mixture

* Added acids were originally for preservative properties. (Should they still be added for flavor?)

* How much zest should be used? Is there a reason to use less or should I just make use of the limes I slay and put it all in?


**end recipe for small batch** (very close to about.com recipe)

2 cups boiling water

1 cup sugar

6 limes (4 zested)

**Alternative recipe** (untested

1360184720.0,180rvd,Not Cocktail of the Week #5: Boulevardier,hebug,31,10,14,"**Not Cocktail of the Week #5: Boulevardier**  
For this week’s post, check out my previous posts on the [Bobby Burns](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/169jv7/cocktail_of_the_week_3_bobby_burns/) or the [Manhattan](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/16pciv/not_cocktail_of_the_week_2_the_manhattan/).   

**Background**  
The creation of the Boulevardier was documented in 1927 by Harry McElhone at Harry’s New York Bar, but when Prohibition was enacted, the obvious difficulties spurred him to move to Europe where he encountered a wide range of new ingredients such as the bitter Italian apéritif Campari. Straddling the line between American whiskey and Italian Campari, he came up with the Boulevardier cocktail, named after the literary magazine helmed by Erskine Gwynne.  
At first glance, with the Boulevardier substituting bourbon whiskey in place of the dry gin. However, it turns out that Boulevardier predates the Negroni by nearly 20 years, as the Negroni was never documented until 1947 despite its purported origins in the 1920s. Maybe Count Camillo Negroni just couldn’t be bothered to write his variation on the Americano down anywhere. Either way, this is a delicious use of Campari and an underappreciated classic cocktail today.  

**Recipes**  
*Barflies and Cocktails* by Harry McElhone circa 1927  
* 1/3 Campari  
* 1/3 Italian vermouth  
* 1/3 Bourbon whisky  
“*Now is the time for all good barflies to come to the aid of the party

*[Imbibe](http://www.imbibemagazine.com/The-Boulevardier-Cocktail-Recipe)*  
* 1.5 oz bourbon  
* 1.0 oz Campari  
* 1.0 oz sweet vermouth  
Stirred on ice
I made this recipe seen [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/17yl4t/not_cocktail_of_the_week_5_preview/)  

 *[New York Times](http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/02/case-study-the-boulevardier/)*  
* 2.0 oz bourbon or rye  
* 1.0 oz Campari  
* 1.0 oz sweet vermouth  
Stirred on ice

**Results**  
This is another cocktail I don’t make often enough. It’s quite delicious, as a liqueur, it results in a sweeter cocktail and a much longer bitter finish. The initial flavor is briefly somewhere between a Manhattan and an Old-Fashioned but matures immediately into the unique citrusy bitterness of Campari.  
 
**Variations**  
As can be seen from the recipes
Usage of different sweet vermouth also can change this cocktail quite a bit, a dry sherry may also be used in substitution of the sweet vermouth. I am not familiar with working with sherry, so how this would change the cocktail, I’m not yet sure, but I am definitely intrigued by the idea.  

**Campari**  
For the section where I try to feature a particularly interesting aspect of this week’s cocktail, and fruit, are unsurprisingly a trade secret, known only a handful of people. It has been reported to have anywhere from 20 to 60 ingredients, but its main flavor notes are quinine, rhubarb, ginseng and orange peel, if I were to try and describe it to somebody else
Over the last century, as can be seen [here](http://www.campari.com/int/en/campari-world/history/), is really quite interesting as you can see as their ads reflect both the art and historical events of the time. In the 1890s, Campari started a calendar featuring artwork from the artist Cesare Tallone, who painted a beautiful woman representing the essence of Campari. Over the next 100 years, many artists contributed to advertising the Campari brand, often playing on the red color and perpetually cultivating the image that Campari is modern. The Campari calendar has recently featured alluring women such as Eva Mendes
Almost 150 years after the invention of Campari, became a topic for discussion in the cocktail scene. Originally, the redness of Campari was due to carmine, which is derived from crushed cochineal beetles. Yes, one of the original ingredients in Campari could be considered beetle juice. However, between arguments over having to slap an “insect-derived” label on things using carmine and the sharp rise in our modern hypersensitive population becoming allergic to everything under the sun, Campari switched to an artificial plant-based dye. Unfortunately this may have coincided with a modification in its recipe, maybe go buy a new bottle and do a side-by-side tasting. I’d love to hear your experience!  

**Cheers!**

The origins of the Martini are unclear, while others argue that the drink originated at the Knickerbocker Hotel in New York City in 1911 or 1912. (via [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martini_%28cocktail%29#Martini_origins_and_mixology)).

Either way, the drink had a 1-1 ratio of gin to vermouth.  Following prohibition, the martini become increasing drier, where the ration of gin to vermouth was generally served 3-1 or 5-1.  As a rule, the drier your martini, the more gin you use.  

Note:  The proportions were initially designed to be for 80 proof gins.  If using a higher proofed gin

**Ingredients**

 * Gin
 * Dry Vermouth
 * Olive (Optional)

**Instructions**

 * Chill a glass with ice (fill with cold water to help chill the glass)
 * In a shaker
 * Pour in the gin (depending on how dry you want it
 * Pour in the dry vermouth (.5 oz is standard)
 * Stir briskly until the glass is very cold 
 * Pour out the water / ice from your chilling glass
 * Strain the drink from the shaker
 * Garnish with an olive (optional

**Variations**

There are almost too many to list.  Virtually every bar with a cocktail list seems to have a special house martini that someone dreamed up.

A Sweet martini involves replacing the dry vermouth with sweet vermouth.  

A medium martini uses half dry and sweet vermouth.  

A gibson involves replacing the olive with a lemon peel and pearl onions.  This can also be made with vodka instead of gin. 

A vodka martini replaces the gin with vodka.

An extra dry martini (8-1 ratio) uses 2 oz dry gin and .25 oz dry vermouth.  

A tequini replaces with gin with tequila and uses either a lemon or lime peel as garnish.

Created in 1924 at Harry’s New York Bar in Paris it was a cocktail that thumbed its nose at the temperist movement. The scofflaw was a big hit with my friends and I it's a shame that it’s fallen out of popularity so I thought I'd share it with reddit.

The Scofflaw Cocktail (Original Recipe):
 
 
Ingredients:

 •1 oz. rye or Canadian whiskey

 •1 oz. dry vermouth

 •1/2 oz. lemon juice

 •1/2 oz. grenadine (we used homemade)

 •1 dash orange bitters (Regan’s)



Assemble:

Currently, just straight recipes. No fancy anecdotes. Few histories. Some vagueness in ingredient names.  It's just a straightforward course in booze and putting more booze with that booze.

Just a few rules I'm giving myself here:

* If it says shake
* If the ingredient does not exist anymore or is unavailable in the US
* No garnish named? Keep it naked.
* The more old fashioned (or European) in ingredient you can get

And now... the [Trinity](http://imgur.com/a/lzaN0#.T5i-rnmg9hs.link).
Actually this is really two cocktails with one go.  This is also listed separately in the book as ""The Perfect cocktail"".  The recipes are identical so perhaps this was an oversight or a deliberate move to recognize two names for the same cocktail.

It calls for equal parts gin, so I would suppose we have something like a *very wet* perfect martini.

The link above charts the mixing itself. So we can pass on that for the text

For my gin, meets the European preference, and doesn't drown a drink in juniper.

For the dry vermouth

For the sweet

Now about the cocktail:
The gin is the Father. The dry is the Holy Spirit. The sweet is the Son.  That's because the sweet vermouth dominates this drink.  It's no wonder the perfect martini ends up paring the vermouth down.  The Trinity/Perfect cocktail is sweet forward

That being said, but it would get the job done.  In fact, the sweet M&amp;R would hide any blemishes in the bad gin.  Not a bad prospect if that's all you have available.

With no further ado

* 3 parts vodka
* 2.5 parts homemade banana syrup (see below)
* Good port wine
* Banana slice garnish (see below)

The banana syrup is easy to make and is a nice alternative to the Runts-esque hyper-banana flavors like you get in 99 bananas or cream of banana. 

Simply put 1 cup of sugar, and the banana itself (reserve a few thick slices for garnish), broken into a few big chunks, in a pot. Bring it to a boil and keep it there until you can't see any individual sugar granules, then reduce it to a low simmer and stir it for about three minutes. You don't want it to darken at all, but the syrup should have a strong banana flavor when you're done. The final product should be lightly straw-colored.

Strain the sryup through a mesh strainer, and then refrigerate it. It should keep for a few weeks, at least, but don't quote me on that.

While you're making the syrup

Fill a short glass (I used a cafe-style juice glass) with ice. Add the vodka and the banana syrup and stir to combine. Float a little bit of port wine on top - just enough to give it a thin later of pretty color. Place on of your caramelized banana slices on the edge and drink!

The flavor is warm and toasty

* 1 750 ml bottle any good bourbon/rye (I used Makers Mark)
* Wide mouthed jar large enough to fit the bourbon and have some room on top
* Cheese cloth (optional but recommended)

Heat up the duck fat in a saucepan until it is liquid, shaking every 30 minutes. Place in freezer for 2+ hours until the fat has solidified on top. Remove from freezer, scoop fat off of the top, pour into another container using a strainer lined with cheese cloth, alternating where you pour so it catches all of the fat. When you are done ""filtering"" it, pour it back into the original (empty) bottle and use.

**History**

There are two possible derivations of the name, Sir Thomas Desmond Gimlette, who introduced this drink as a means of inducing his messmates to take lime juice as an anti-scurvy medication in the late 1800's (a disease caused by a Vitamin D deficiency). The medication had been lemons until English lime growers lobbied to replace it with limes, which didn't end up having the best effect because limes have about 1/4 of the anti-scurvy properties of lemons. Plenty of scurvy ensued. 

The next possible derivation hails from the fact that a 'gimlet' is a corkscrew-like device used for making holes in barrels to get to its contents. The British Royal Navy

**Ingredients**

* 2 oz Gin (or Vodka
* 1 oz Lime Juice
* .5 oz Simple Syrup
* Garnish with a slice of lime

Essentially this is a gin sour. The measurements are not exact by any means. Too sour? .5 to .75 oz lime juice is good. Too sweet? .25 oz would work just fine. 1 oz of lime juice is usually just 1 full lime

A lot of recipes will call for Rose's Lime juice. If that is all you've got

**Directions**

Combine the ingredients and shake with ice. Strain into a chilled coup or martini glass and garnish. This drink can also be served over ice in an old fashioned glass if you prefer.

And that's it! By itself, it's not hard to add varying tastes and textures to make it different.

* 1 ¾ oz. Cucumber-Infused gin*

* ¾ oz. Lime Juice
 
* ¼ oz. Elderflower syrup

* Float of Champagne


In an ice filled mixing glass

*Cucumber Gin

* 1 Cucumber

* Zest of 1 lemon or orange

* 1 750-ml. bottle unflavored gin

Tip: Tastes great without the spirits being infused too


*[Rye](http://www.ryesf.com/)'s Basil Gimlet*

* 2 ounces No. 209 gin

* Half a lime

* ½ oz. simple syrup

* 5 basil leaves

To make simple syrup

Tip: You could make it with vodka, it doesn’t have the crisp freshness critical to the drink’s success.

Posting the CoW this week on behalf of j_alt.  I figured we'd go with the grandaddy of them all.  The ingredients are incredibly straightforward

Here's my take:

* 3-4 oz Bourbon
* 1 sugar cube
* 2 dashes Ango Bitters
* 2 dashes Orange Bitters
* 1 tsp water
* Orange Zest
* Cherry (optional)

Rub the inside of an Old-Fashioned or Rocks glass with the orange zest, and muddle.  Add 1 oz of the Bourbon and stir. Add ice to fill glass, then add the last of Bourbon and stir some more. Garnish with the orange zest (or a fresh orange slice) and optional cherry. Don't let soda water anywhere near anything.

This is probably my all-time favorite drink

My first drink will certainly be a manhattan of some sort.

I've ordered the [Buffalo Trace White Dog Rye Mash](http://www.drinkhacker.com/2011/09/12/review-buffalo-trace-white-dog-wheated-mash-and-rye-mash/), an unaged rye whiskey, and plan to combine that with *Carpano Antica* and Angostura, for a very conventional take on the Manhattan. I'll probably do a side-by-side with the unaged version of that cocktail, and a bottle aged manhattan made with Bulleit Rye.

That still leaves me with a bottle to experiment with. I've been considering gin cocktails for this, or a vesper. All of them are drinks I plan to make at some point, but the real question is which one gets the honor of being first?

Really I just don't want to pay nearly $30 a bottle for something that has no competition. I don't like the monopoly they seem to have over the Negroni market.



My ingredients list comes mainly from the 1983 book *Big Secrets*.



The ingredients (in parts):

* 20 Bitter Orange Peel

* 16 Angelica Root

* 16 Buckbean Leaves

* 16 Lemon Peel

* 12 Anise

* 12 Calamus

* 12 Fennel

* 12 Orris Root

* 12 Wormwood Leaves

* 8 Cinnamon

* 7 Cloves

* 5 Marjoram

* 5 Sage

* 5 Thyme

* 2 Rosemary



The recipe says all parts are percolated with 50% alcohol. The resulting infusing is then to be used to flavour a large amount of alcohol/water mixture. After that a bit of red carmine and brown carmel for color.

There is a lot of tricks to them and most bars I find make them wrong unless your at a place that charges a lot. I am going to use this tread to add all that I know about Manhattans feel free to add information in the comments.


**Background**

Manhattans are one of the oldest cocktails and were invented in.... MANHATTAN. There are many rumors to where and when in NYC it was conceived but it is not known for certain. The original Manhattans were made with American Rye Whiskey


**What you need and what I use**

1) A glass - Martini glass, or a wine glass (if you do not have the others)

2) A cocktail strainer or something to strain out the ice.

3) A mixing spoon DO NOT SHAKE A MANHATTAN 

4) A speed pourer - These help you measure your drink and are relatively costless. If you don't have one just use a very good eye. 

5) Whiskey - American Rye or American Bourbon: Just like with a martini, it blends well with vermouth), Willet straight rye whiskey (this one is very spicy and strong, not for the weak willed), any Redemption bourbon (I choose this if I have a desire to drink bourbon, this is a not as sweet bourbon and goes well with the vermouth, or if I am feeling cheap Old Overholt (this is the cheapest passible whiskey IMO and at $15 a bottle you really cannot go wrong).

6) Vermouth Sweet or dry - A traditional manhattan is made with sweet, dry vermouth is still very sweet and I like to taste my whiskey) I use Cocchi vermouth as it is great for it's price.

7) Bitters - Trust me you want to use bitters. Bitters is like salt for whiskey

8)Garnish - cherries or orange peal (I use moonshine soaked cherries that I pat down with a paper towel to make sure they are dry)

9) ice  - Regular ice cube tray works fine.


**How to make**

1) Take your martini glass and chill it by adding ice over the top and filling with water

2) In a separate glass add the following ingredients 
     a) a six count of your whiskey (1 1/2 ounces)
     b) a two count of vermouth (1/2 ounce; if making a perfect a one count of each type) I actually halve the vermouth but that is my preference
     c) two drops of bitters 

3) Add ice over the liquid and stir with a mixing spoon or just a table spoon if you do not have that. Do not stir to violently.

4) Empty your martini glass and shake over the sink to get the excess water out.

5) Strain the Manhattan into your martini glass 

6) add garnish


**Why you do not shake a manhattan**

The reason you do not shake a manhattan is that it ""bruises"" the whiskey and changes it's texture.  You want your manhattan to be smooth like silk and if you shake it you will loose that affect.

This is a first pass at this and my first post so I may add stuff later if I forgot anything.

**History**

Far from just a drink's name, Cuba had finally earned their independence from Spain. It was at this time that Coca-Cola first found its way to Cuban shores, imported from their friends in the United States (who helped them earn their independence). This was a very different Coca-Cola from what we know today, with about 9 mg of cocaine per serving. One thing that hasn't changed, however, is that it pairs well with the cane-sugar derived rum so common in this island nation. Add a little lime and a healthy dose of nationalist pride, and the *Cuba Libre* was born.

Who drank the first Cuba Libre? We may never know. Bacardi, ordered by a Captain Russell from the United States Army Signal Corps, though this claim is suspect. There's at least one account that it was a member of the Signal Corps, but that man was not positively identified as anyone beyond ""John Doe.""

From Cuba, making a notable foothold in Trinidad. When American troops were dispatched to this little island nation during World War II, the locals were inspired to write a little calypso song:

&gt; Since the Yankees come to Trinidad

&gt; They have the young girls going mad

&gt; The young girls say they treat them nice

&gt; And they give them a better price

&gt; They buy rum and coca-cola

&gt; Go down Point Cumana

&gt; Both mother and daughter

&gt; Working for the the Yankee dollar

&gt; -Rupert Westmore Grant ""Rum and Coca-Cola""

The song became very popular in the US,"" as performed by Andrews Sisters, helped to shine the limelight on the Cuba Libre and catapult it to worldwide fame.

**Ingredients**

As the name is used today

*2 oz Light rum*

*4 oz Coca-Cola*

*0.5 oz Lime juice (Half a lime)*

**Making the Cuba Libre**

Fill a highball glass with ice. Add lime juice and rum. Top with Coca-Cola. Garnish with a lime wedge.

**Variations**

* Captain and Coke uses Captain Morgan spiced rum

* Replacing some of the Coca-cola with club soda results in a lighter

* In Trinidad

* Cherry or Vanilla coke can be used

* [Coke with dark rum and amaretto supposedly brings out the almond-cherry flavor of coke.](http://mixthatdrink.com/mixys-rum-and-coke/)

I bought the herbs from Mountain Rose Herbs and they arrived quickly and in great condition (fresh). 

Total cost of this experiment, Ball jars, and cheesecloth =  $157.83. But I have a TON of herbs left over for future bittering experiments.

[ALBUM](http://imgur.com/a/ENFeD)

I couldn't find high-proof rye at a decent price and so used high-proof bourbon instead. Wild Turkey 101. I used the oranges for zest and to make the dried orange peel.

I was hesitant to attempt this recipe because it's so labor intensive. Then I decided to experiment with the preparation methods to try to simplify the process for future attempts.

**Method 1: By the book**

* Allow all ingredients to soak in whiskey for 2 weeks; shake daily.
* Strain out the solids and save the infused whiskey.
* Boil/simmer the solids in water and allow to steep in the water one more week.
* Strain out the solids and add the infused water to the infused whiskey.
* Voila.

**Method 2: Cook ingredients first**

* Boil/simmer the ingredients in water.
* Add water and solids to whiskey.
* Steep for 3-4 weeks; shake daily.
* Strain out the solids.
 
**Method 3: No cook

* Add ingredients to mixture of water and whiskey.
* Allow to steep for 3-4 weeks
* Strain out the solids.

**Negroni**

The Negroni is a very odd, even if his country no longer recognizes the distinction), or, at the very least, extremely old money- his level of eccentricity and general disconnect from the rest of humanity can only come from generations of people with too much time on their hands.  He enjoys making his household staff dress up in silly outfits, and refuses to eat off orange plates (orange bowls are fine).  He's obsessed with a certain breed of dog, probably Scottish Terriers or Miniature Schnauzers.  His house is filled with paintings, and other memorabilia depicting them.  Ironically

He doesn't have any kids, including the Boulevardier, who moved to New York to work on Wall St.  He makes a genuine effort to stay in touch with all of them, even if it's only a rather impersonal letter every few years.

**Manhattan**

The archetypal lovable asshole.  Works for the same firm as the Boulevardier and is actually his wife's 3rd cousin, although no one has any hard evidence.  As much of a conceited douche as he is, he doesn't come across as the infidelitous type.

He only drives German sports cars.  He'd really like a Ferrari, especially the Yankees, although he gets really mad if anyone points out how much they suck at the moment.  He's currently obsessed with soccer, or at least tells everyone he is because he thinks it makes him look sophisticated.",,False,self,False,t3_1e14uj

My experience with tequila has been making syrup drinks with Cuervo for friends who like that stuff. Now I actually enjoy the drink and decided to get into it.

I am a big whiskey drinker. I like very short drinks. I like neat whiskey. I prefer American whiskey

So I picked up some reposado tequila, aged rum, etc) and the internet made it sound like a lot of aged tequilas are just another type of whiskey with no agave characteristics, just an agave mash and some export technicalities. So I settled on reposado.

The problem is

I may sound like a pretentious dolt in this post but I'm not too worried because I'll bet at this point most people in this subreddit are nodding their heads in agreement.

So what I am asking is

I made an Old Fashioned using the Corralejo and here is the recipe

1.5 ounces tequila
1 dash Angostura
Quarter teaspoon dark agave syrup
Stir in short glass

I like Old Fashioneds warm and iceless, cut down on your Angostura dashing if using a reposado (don't wanna drown it out) and use agave syrup instead of sugar (but in smaller amounts; the syrup should have a conversion on the back for cane sugar in recipes).
