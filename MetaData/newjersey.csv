My father was coming home from work today at around 6:30pm going east on rt-24 in his yellow Pontiac Solstice (tiny little sports car). It was stop and go traffic and a large flat-bed truck with large wire coils on it started repeated ramming my father's car. The truck driver would let space build, over and over again. My father has no idea who it was or why but it was violent and he was honestly scared for his life.

The man got back in the truck and started driving at him so my father drove away before the truck could hit him at a higher speed. Eventually my father found a NJ trooper who radioed ahead where I believe they pulled him over.

My father said he saw people video taping the incident on their phones (this wasn't a fender bender

The fatal accident happened at 11:30 p.m. in the area of mile marker 30.1 eastbound. State Police say 22-year-old Jonathan Schifferdecker of Cape May Court House drove his Chevy Malibu into the back of a tanker truck. The impact caused his car to become engulfed in flames and Schifferdecker died at the scene.


Another accident happened at 8:48 p.m. near mile marker 29.9 eastbound. That's where State Police say a 9-year-old boy was flown from the scene after the car he was riding in struck the concrete median. Authorities say a person who witnessed the accident had gotten out of their vehicle to check on the victims


There was also a minor accident around the same time near the same mile marker on the westbound side of the expressway. No injuries were reported.

Hi all

I'm the nightlife coordinator for Caesars Entertainment in AC and I can actually set up a lot for us, roped off section, etc.

Just let me know a day that would be good for you guys and I'll set up the rest. I just request that it be either a Wednesday, we have PSY performing at The Pool and it's going to be hell and a half)


UPDATE:
Wow
THIS DATE &amp; LOCATION ARE NOT A DEFINITE YET.

If we do a Wednesday or a Friday I can set it up at The Pool after Dark at Harrahs if you guys would prefer that.

FAQs:
Anything for 18+?

 I suggest we have a pregame party (in a suite if anyone wants to spring for one) and/or a dinner so the underage redditors can join in the fun

Anything for rooms? 

Yes I can get Reduced rate rooms

What if I can't make this date? 

I'll plan more meet ups! Also anytime you guys come to AC feel free to message me and I can offer help where I can!

What if I'm not from NJ?

The more the merrier! Unless youre a crab-person. Crab people are not welcome.

Also a redditor ( u/whatthefuckman ) was kind enough to make a meet up page http://www.meetup.com/NJReddit/events/93232772/?a=socialmedia

**********UPDATE 2:***********

LOCATION: The Pool after Dark

REDUCED ROOM RATES: $129

COMPS: FREE ADMISSION TIL 12

SECTION IN THE CLUB: LARGE ROPED OFF SECTION BY THE DJ

DINNER: Dos Caminos or Bills Burger Bar


If we do it Saturday (12/15):

[Click here for the latest NOAA briefing PDF/Slideshow](http://www.erh.noaa.gov/phi/briefing/packages/current_briefing.pdf). 

**[Public Statement from the NWS

I will try to update twice a day as I get confirmations from the NWS and NHC at NOAA. We should get a checklist of things to make sure everyone has ready just in case (specifically for NJ, and the hurricane itself makes it a hybrid storm... which is much more dangerous. Do not pay attention to the category of the storm, as it will be more intense than the category lets on. The reports are saying it is very slow moving and could last for days. Sunday/Monday is projected to be when Hurricane Shitstorm hits. I will update as new info comes in.


**UPDATE 11PM EST SATURDAY 27th** [NHC](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/storm_graphics/AT18/refresh/AL1812W_NL+gif/153841W_NL_sm.gif) models are showing a *direct hit over SOUTHERN NJ/DELAWARE this coming [TUESDAY/WEDNESDAY](http://cdn.abclocal.go.com/images/wpvi/cms_exf_2007/weather/8862348_600x338.jpg)*. Get ready. Better safe than sorry. Be sure to check in on your elderly neighbors as well!!! The Washington Post's Weather Gang [has commentary](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/experts-sound-alarm-on-hurricane-sandy-drawing-comparisons-to-2001-perfect-storm/2012/10/25/f25a81fc-1ed7-11e2-9cd5-b55c38388962_blog.html) you should read as to why this isn't your typical storm. I like how the NWS put this in their forecast... **INTERESTS ARE REMINDED NOT TO FOCUS ON THE EXACT TRACK OF THIS SYSTEM SINCE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS WILL EXTEND WELL AWAY FROM THE LOCATION OF THE CENTER** it's not a small storm. It will impact you

[HERE](http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/qpf/zoom/Rainfall_Days_1-5.gif) is the expected total rainfall over the next few days. Better get your boats out

[LIVE Police, Rail radio scanners online](http://www.radioreference.com/apps/audio/) who I believe has an app.

The American Red Cross does not have a list of shelters available yet. When this is ready

It's an extra-tropical cyclone. It's kind of a mix between a nor'easter and a hurricane, and you're in for a lot of flooding. They're calling for up to 10 inches of rain in a best case scenario. DO NOT FUCK AROUND. See a flooded road? DONT DRIVE THROUGH IT. 

Shore faring folks that might/will probably get evacuated

**PLEASE BE SURE TO BRING ALL PROJECTILES INSIDE!!** Turn your tables upside down (trick I learned last year)

Here are things to do the day before (Please comment to add more if I missed some)

* **This is the time to turn your refrigerator to the highest setting.** If the power goes out your fridge will stay colder longer. Also its a good time to take out shit that does not need to be in there and to reorganize food in types of priority. Things that spoil should be in the front to minimize the time the door is open.

* Do the dishes. If the water goes out you will have dirty dishing smelling up the place.

* I am also freezing water in plastic containers in the freezer to fill in empty space with ice in case the power goes out.

* Recharge/fill your rechargeable batteries.

* Do your laundry

* Clean out your bathtub and fill it with water. Make sure the seal is good so it does not leak out in case the water is out for a while. This will be for toilet flushing in case the water does not work. All you need is a bucket and you pour it down the toilet for it to flush. Also this could be your last resort drinking water.

* Gather all flashlights and or candles in one place that is easy to access and you can locate in the dark. Place the batteries there as well as lighters/matches. Also place the first aid kit/ radio there if you have one.

* Place all tools you think you will need i.e. Power tools/ chainsaws in one localized place. Place gas tanks tied down and secured outside. Its really unwise to place full gas tanks indoors and in a non ventilated place.

* If you have a generator

* Check your smoke alarm and carbon monoxide alarm batteries. If the power goes out and you need to use candles

* If you don't know where your water/gas/ and electricity shut off is

* If you have a detached garage

* Put all medication in an easy to find area.

* start filling big pots with water for cooking and or heating. If your electric goes out

Please comment to add more tips

* **edit more stuff

* **Remember gas stations need electricity to pump gas

* Have some duct tape and garbage bags ready in case one of your windows get smashed by debris.

* As per Huludfan82 and yesmydog

* As per jeffrife

* As per Teknishun

* As per orange386, LED lamps... check. Will regularly go out to the buffet to eat at least 2-3 meals worth. Come at me Sandy.

Then about 8-10 officers entered my home and sweeped it. At this point were all freaking out not knowing what's going on. Within 30 seconds of them entered we had presented IDs which proved we lived there. The police continued to have an aggressive demeanor with us telling us to shut the fuck up, really?

After the lieutenant got all the info he left with everyone. The whole thing only took about 5-10 minutes so it was very fast and left us kinda shocked.

He is not spayed yet and unfortunately he was not wearing his collar on the morning he went missing.

4 hours ago I hear a knock at my door and it's the police. I go out on the porch to speak with them, I would have to take responsibility for it. He said it was my duty to report illegal drugs if they were in my house and they didn't belong to me. I failed to do that apparently, and was taken into custody where I was processed and released. I am shocked, especially because I don't even smoke marijuana. 

But even if it was mine, at 10pm, smoke a joint? Why is it classified as being more dangerous than cocaine? When are we going to stop lying to ourselves? The fact that I am tangled up in this mess illustrates how out of touch with reality these drug laws are, especially the laws pertaining to the personal use of marijuana.

And yet Governor Christie says he will veto any legislation that decriminalizes it. Why? Why waste valuable resources prosecuting non violent drug offenders, freeing up valuable resources and restoring a certain respect back to the law.

When you demonize and outlaw a substance that is widely accepted to be medicine, revere it even; but when laws are ruining peoples' lives for the sake of a plant, it makes it hard to feel that the system we have in place is just.

A Sunday this time!  Oh-la-la!  

Deets:

**All ages welcome!** Everyone is invited

The 4th avenue beach entrance is a perfect spot to meet up. There is ample parking, and the schedule is [here.](http://www.njtransit.com/pdf/rail/R0080.pdf) I know you can bring your bikes on the train, too. It's a five minute bike ride to the beach from the train station. Buses also run right down to the beach, and those schedules can also be found on the [NJ transit website.](http://www.njtransit.com/hp/hp_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=HomePageTo) It's also very easy to get to Asbury via the parkway and routes 35, 36, 34, 66, 18.

A few of you local types never surfaced.  For shame!  Ikilledyourcat and myself did go to visit a super awesome Redditor who owns a business right on the boardwalk, ok y'all?  Just come!  

There is LOTS of stuff to do.  We can rent [these things](http://sandblastweekend.com/Fun_%26_Play_files/Brielle%20Cyclery%20pic.jpg) on the boardwalk.  How awesome would that be?  There is mini golf, [Criterion](http://www.criterionchocolates.com/) should be re-opened by then inside convention hall which means SALT WATER TAFFY!  There are bathrooms, outside showers, water fountains, etc.  Just come out!  DO IT DO IT DO IT!

It's an extra-tropical cyclone. It's kind of a mix between a nor'easter and a hurricane, and you're in for a lot of flooding. They're calling for up to 10 inches of rain in a best case scenario. DO NOT FUCK AROUND. See a flooded road? DONT DRIVE THROUGH IT.

I would expect to see evacuations in areas where Sandy struck.. there will be a storm surge of over 4 to 7 ft. and very high -high tides..there will be strong on shore winds from the north east in excess of 45 mph and could be as high as 60 mph...now the tricky part - temps..the onshore wind flow will keep temps warmer along the coast..however if the storm intensifies quickly and can pull cold air down from aloft we could see a wet heavy snow in our area, FIRE

Also, I've jumped through every one of the hoops out there, so might be able to help others. AMA?",El_Dubious_Mung,55,31, I've told everyone that the days and weeks after the storm were irrelevant. It's the months and years afterwards that really matter. Little did I know how right I'd be.

I live in Atlantic City. It took us about a week to get back onto the island after the storm. This was because the utility companies had to clean up downed wires

We get back to the house, living room, dining room, laundry room, garage, motorcycle, car....all kaput. 

Now, so we think we're alright.....nope. My dad made sure to get his claim in quickly, as the office was nearby. Then the waiting game starts. It was probably close to 2 months before we had an adjuster stop by. Not the insurance company adjuster, but a private one. We got tired of waiting. 

All in all, but I don't wanna take the chance). 

Eventually the private adjuster gets the insurance adjuster out to our house

In the meantime, you are REQUIRED to have flood insurance.

If you're in a V-zone,000. Guess who got put into a V-zone? 

Now, not into it. Furthermore, if there was westerly wind action, my dad's boat would have destroyed the house it was docked next to. 

My father attended the meeting with county officials and FEMA where they hashed out the floodzones. He brought up the issue of their faulty data. Mayor Langford of Atlantic City needs to be fired. He didn't say a word

After that meeting, so county officials shouldn't be too quick to act on that data. I dunno if my dad had anything to do with that, but I like to think so. 

Doesn't matter, not how they should be. 

During this time, some even down some money as they started rebuilding out of their pocket hoping the clients insurance company would come through. 

One has to ask, but hey, we needed help, too. What were we paying for all those years? Where did that money go? I strongly expect someone was robbing Peter to pay Paul. It would be great if some investigator followed the money trail. 

So about a week ago, and then you can appeal for more, up to the limits of your policy. 

I am infuriated. The only logic I can see behind this is that it's like a rebate. You buy something for a price, as our house can't be raised. This means we need every cent we were assessed at before we can even get started. Who knows how long this appeals process will take. 

From that check, and then they dole out money from those funds for us to get started (which we can't). They take about 30% of the money to hold on to.  So we're working with about 1/3 of our total assessed damage value. 

Another speed-bump: If you're behind on your mortgage, but let's just say this bank is a very big one known to screw people over left and right.

I'm sure I left out other details, others seem like a ponzi-scheme. I admit I don't have all the facts, but there's enough going on that this kinda stuff needs to be thoroughly investigated and monitored.

Thank you for contacting me with your concerns about the PROTECT IP Act.  I appreciate hearing from you on this important issue.
 
The “Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property (PROTECT IP) Act of 2011” (S. 968) would give law enforcement additional tools to combat the illegal online sale of counterfeit or copyright infringing goods.  Specifically, advertising networks, and Internet service providers.  It would allow suit against site operators, but would not allow law enforcement to block access to a site.  This bill would also require plaintiffs to sue the owner or registrant of a domain name before bringing suit against a site itself.  
 
The “PROTECT IP Act” was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in May 2011 and now awaits action by the full Senate.  Please be assured that I will keep your views in mind as the Senate considers this issue.  Thank you again for contacting me.
