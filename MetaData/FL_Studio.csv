Getting that out of the way, and power to those dudes.  They could post to musicmakers and other subreddits after that, knowing they have a positive sympathetic reception.  They can go on and get some people paying attention to their work.  The problem is all the shitty tracks.

Frankly, the composition might be cliche, the production in general is just...off.  We should be upvoting THAT stuff.  We should be commenting on that like crazy.  Those posts deserve lots of attention, those are the guys that need help.  They're doing a good thing by bringing their music to the attention of more experienced producers, we should all try to help.

1357163257.0,15ujsa,Hey FL studio warriors! Let's hear your top 5 interface tips. (xpost of selfpost @ WATMM),qp0n,41,6,24,"I'm just an average joe mediocre independent producer but I love FL and have an intermediate level of experience with it. But I still often &amp; regularly get the feeling I am doing things inefficiently and there has to be an easier way than way I am doing... so I am always discovering &amp; looking for new tips &amp; tricks within the madness that is the FL interface. Referring mainly to the little things that save time

Naturally

1) Holding shift when sliding a point in an automation clip will keep it from moving vertically. Finding this out even one project too late is frustrating enough to warrant mention. I have full-on OCD when it comes to my automation clips and having a level be even 1-2% off can be disastrous for FMsynth and tempo clips. The moment I accidentally learned this I instantly dropped a few points off my blood pressure. (which reminds me - took me a bit before realizing you can right-click and set an automation clip for the tempo. Makes easy tempo shifts and can result in some pretty cool effects)

2) The pattern selector in the step sequencer has a ""split by channel"" option which will split the channels of a pattern into their own separate distinct patterns

3) Pretty common knowledge but ... the ""make unique"" option in the dropdown menu for patterns and automation clips - use it and use it often.

4) Most effects and generators have a ""store in separate state"" option which makes FL studio remember your current custom settings

5) ctrl+z undoes

and

6) Inverted linking is one of my favorite tools and If you are unfamiliar with it then I highly recommend it for a ""Send"" track in your mixer for every project - basically just turns any two tracks into an automatic turntable fader - Right click a volume slider in the mixer, then switch the drop menu to ""invert"" and adjust the formula to customize. Great for adding in random samples to break up repetition.

Bonus Tip: immediately rename new patterns to numbers, bass, etc) by tiers of 10 or maybe even 100 to leave room for each unique pattern. This not only makes it easier to identify what kind of pattern each clip is, but when zooming in/out and using short clips the squished title will still read the first character of the pattern name.
___________

Really though I'm most interested in hearing others' tips. There's too much in FLstudio to discover on my own and every small trick directly converts to minutes of sleep.

-Holding Alt in most situations disables snap to grid
-Hold Ctrl and the Paintbrush becomes the Selector.  
-Holding Ctrl+Shift while clicking will add or subtract to your selection clip by clip.  
-Holding Shift then dragging with the left mouse button duplicates the selection. (Useful more often than Ctrl+B because everything stays relative to the grid)  
-Holding down the left mouse button and double-clicking the right mouse button will mute/unmute a clip.  

-Holding shift while using the Slice tool will make it so you don't have to drag the stupid thing down through the clip.  

-Ctrl+L will assign a Channel to the next free mixer track.  
-Shift+Ctrl+L for multiple Channels all in a row.  
-Double-click the ""fx"" number window in the Channel Settings to go straight to that track in the Mixer. (Without accidentally dragging it to the wrong track... fnsonofabitch..)

- Should I release this so others can use this? If so

1360696696.0,18e5zf,Some tips for getting a better mix.,,24,3,2,"Copied from an email from Monstercat:

Some tips for getting a better mix.

Give yourself lots of headroom on all your sounds. The loudest sound in the mix is the usually the kickdrum and it should be no louder then -8DB

Pay attention to overlapping frequencies in the bass area of your track. The low frequencies from all your sounds (even if you can't hear them) will add together and compete with your kick and bassline. EQ can be used to cut out these unwanted low frequencies.

Use automation and panning but don't overdo it. Panning is helpful when layering high end sounds or giving space to percussive elements that hit on the same beat.

Eliminate 20 hertz (Deepest Lowend) even from subbass to get a cleaner sound. 20 hertz is inaudible but will still make the speaker move.

Unmixed Clip Sample Download

Kick and bassline more noticeable and clash less. High end is crisper.

Mixed Clip Sample Download

Mastering
Mastering is the final stage where effects are used only on the master channel. The main purpose of mastering is to boost the perceived Loudness of the track through brickwall limiting and multiband compression. Other processes are also used in attempt to issues with a poor mix. Mastering is an essential process but it can only do so much
A recommended plug-in for mastering would be lzotope Ozone

1370174691.0,1fikf2,[Listen] Post-Hardcore/Metalcore song done completely in FL and how I have the drums set up in FPC for easy sequencer usage,StarMech,16,1,12,"[Here's the soundcloud link.](https://soundcloud.com/seanmatthewwenzelfried/flute)

Hi

I own a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 (had an E-MU 1616m, which were then run through Line 6's Pod Farm and Soundgoodizer.

The drums are completely programmed. The samples I use are random ones I've collected over time, adjusted the velocity trigger sliders to their appropriate places for each sample, and then set the FPC to trigger randomly while never hitting the sample just used. Each piece has its own FPC while being set to trigger on note C5 for easy sequencer use. Each FPC channel was assigned to its own mixer insert and adjusted accordingly.

[http://i.imgur.com/VT4EM8y.png](http://i.imgur.com/VT4EM8y.png)

The reason I did this instead of using one single FPC was that, please let me know.

While this setup is immensely easier for me to write in,"" mindset), I went back and changed all of the FPC trigger notes, starting with C5 and descending. I then threw all of my FPC's into a layer to be able to use a single piano roll for the entire drumkit, similar to how it would work if everything was in a single channel. The only downside to this is that the keys aren't labeled in the piano roll. They simply say C5, C#5, and so on. I guess it's not THAT big of a deal considering you can use the pencil tool and hear each time you place a note

* Set each channel EQ frequency (1

* Load a VST
* Be sure to disable channel 4's output into your master.

This allows you to apply individual effects for different EQ Ranges. For example you could add distortion only to the lows (bass) and have a mellow reverb on the mids and highs. 

The possibilities are endless with this and it leads to the creation of very unique sounds. 

It also really opens up the soundscape and adds a lot more quality to your productions. 

Can also be used for a really WTF effect with vocals.

1376622896.0,1kgr8r,My band uses FL for everything except for drums and vocals. Here's how with a few questions regarding optimization.,StarMech,19,9,15,"My band recently had a core member quit and he took our van with him. We had a small tour coming up along with some other shows that we really didn't want to drop

Using an FSP with FL is interesting, the difference being the master outputs are controlled by the volume knob on the front, while all other outputs just seem to be turned all the way up (I learned the hard way).

[FSP Outs](http://i.imgur.com/S44UGMs.png)

So why get something with so many ins and outs? We have 3 guitarists and a bassist plugging in

[Guitar Insert](http://i.imgur.com/C3QGmes.png)

Over in FL and going down the chain, one for clean, which are automated on and off (Now that I think about it, ""Link to Controller""-ing to the distortion automation with an inverse formula would be better than automating them individually. Another great reason for typing this out! :D). I have a Soundgoodizer on there which I'm sure some people will disagree with, but it really beefs the sound up and doesn't rape resources. Then follows a limiter, which is then followed by delay and reverb which are automated on and off as well, and an EQ.

Since we have 3 guitarists which is comprised of mostly 2 leads, I have one lead panned hard left, one panned hard right, and the rhythm and bass in center, bussed to a ""Band"" insert. The guitars were mixed together, and I now have a nice slider I can easily adjust them to fit the rest of the project.

[Playlist](http://i.imgur.com/q6oEHwf.png)

We got the bounced files for synth and background vocals and harmonies from our producer. Dropped them into the project, turned on the click, and recorded audio on the master insert. Using the beeps, I created 2 wavs. One for the high beep, and one for the low. We use the high beeps for count offs just to make sure no one gets lost. For example, there will be 8 low beeps, 4 high beeps to count off

[Click Setup](http://i.imgur.com/JKAabi5.png)

I grabbed an insert to be the click bus

Currently

[Bus volume knob](http://i.imgur.com/vDdYwzF.png)

That's pretty much everything. When we set everything up, and no sound guy is going to do that. If they do, people don't look at the band, they look at the sound guy and say, ""Why can't I hear their guitars?""

The questions are:
Is there anything I've overlooked that may increase performance? I generally have really high CPU usage until I hit tools &gt; macro &gt; smart disable. Is there any way I can have this happen automatically? I shouldn't have TOO much of an issue. Specs are quad core 3.5 GHz i7 and 32 gigs of RAM on Win7 x64 (which makes me hate FL for being a 32bit program).

Is there ANY way to take single stereo channel and turn it into dual mono? If I currently plug headphones into output 4, which isn't enough for my entire band to move to personalized click tracks. If I can have each individual out as a separate mix, I'll have WAY more than enough. I understand there is no way to set FL to have mono outputs, but if I can convert one side of a stereo channel to dual mono, I can create to panned clicks and send them to a stereo out to be converted into dual mono.

The pattern at the top is obviously my kick. I'm using peak controllers on the kick for all my sidechains.  As you can see there are small transitions in the track where the kick temporarily drops out and is then re-introduced. And that's my problem. Whenever the kick drops out there is a noticeable gain in volume and lack of sidechain in all the sidechained channels. 

Is there any way I can work around this


So does anyone know any solution? As I said before the sidechain is the peak controller method.

I used to play keyboards, and have an old Mackie 1204 mixer. I played in a hobby cover band for a couple of years, just for fun.

My new interest in music software comes from my 13 year old son. He takes electric guitar lessons, keys, but no lead guitar ('cause he's supposed to play that part).

So, and for Windows, and they love and recommend Cubase. Cubase looks like capable software and likely their basic version would likely be all we'd need. My concern with them is, from what I've read, their aggressive copy protection policy can be a hassle (hardware dongle), and their upgrades seem expensive.

I came across FL Studio and it looks like a pretty good choice from what I've looked at. I also really appreciate the common-sense policy that would allow me to use the software on a second computer in my house. Also, for example) get free upgrades as well? Some of these plugins seem expensive, if purchased on their own...and would make a free upgrade to the software not so free if they don't come along as well. What about purchased plugins? Do they upgrade for free, or is there an upgrade price for these when newer versions of either the plugin or FL Studio come out?

Unfortunately, and such seem to be pretty heavy on the techno/house/dance music, which is really not my thing. Is FL Studio good for rock/pop music as well? What about the sounds that come with it? Would I need the Hardcore effects plugin to be able to do rock music?

I use the Oxygen 25 Midi controller with FL Studio on a Windows Vista laptop. I've had the keyboard for about 1 year or so now and I'm starting to run into problems with it.


The keyboard will randomly stop working with FL Studio. The power remains on, unplug and replug the keyboard back in and then restart FL Studio. Which is a pain.


Has anyone had similar issues? I'm honestly not sure if it's FL acting up or just the keyboard. I haven't been able to pinpoint the cause of the problem

1288374404.0,dycod,A quick guide to compression.,Pagan-za,7,0,6,"Most people dont really understand compressors

If you look at any compressor, Gain, Attack, Release, and Type.

Threshold: This is the limit for when the compressor starts to compress. Anything under this limit is ignored. anything over it is compressed. The way you set this is to check on the mixer where your sample peaks it, sample will be unaffected up to that point.

Ratio: Simply put, 10:1 and above is refered to as limiting, and you can even have infinite:1 which is basically brickwall limiting.

Gain: This is the gain of the sound AFTER compression. Setting this sets the output level. Simple as that.

Attack/Release: This is the speed at which the compressor compresses

Type: Generally this will be Hard or Soft

So when should you use a compressor? The first answer is only when you know you need it. Alot of people love throwing a compressor on everything. All this will do is reduce the dynamic range overall and make a wall of sound. And it never sounds good(It will be loud and in your face

Compressors can be used to give a kick drum thump and make it stand out over everything else

[Image for following the steps.](http://imgur.com/McbMm7e)

1. Turn the Transpose knob down two octaves (-2).

2. Lower the volume a bit

3. Activate a resonator (the top one in this case) and drag the slider all the way to the right. Also increase the 
feedback after personal preferences. This will cause a warm bass sound.

4. Play with the other resonators; activate one or a few more and experiment with the feedback.

5. Be creative and do whatever crazy stuff you'd like to do!

 and tracks I can make in the playlist? Also why is there an option to have multiple playlists

From what I understand a song I write basically looks like a playlist which is composed of a number of patterns, piano etc). So in my composition process, should I be writing each instrument part on a separate pattern, then copy pasta'ing to separate tracks in the playlist (to make verses, choruses etc), considering I want to have some midi but also some actual audio (like .wav recording of me physically playing some chords or a lead part on guitar). Should I be including a bassline along in one pattern with the drums, or is it best to keep them all separate, but not on the drums as a whole.
