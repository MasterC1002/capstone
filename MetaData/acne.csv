-------
Most of us have gotten a lot of useful life tips from reddit, and no one simple thing is going to change that. Acne is caused and helped by different things for different people. Dirty skin is not likely to be the real cause, so slight hygiene improvements can only help so much. Generally speaking, what works for someone else won't work for you, and sometimes most of the things that SHOULD work don't. I know how frustrating that is, having tried numerous products over the past few years, and finding that even the best ones don't help, and it can be nearly impossible for most people to distinguish the good advice from the baseless crap that makes up 90% of acne-related websites. 

I've tried to extract the useful information from all this, and what you do will depend on your skin type and the nature of your acne.

**Basic Acne Treatment**

Before continuing, and most of the treatments available for it. [Acne.org](http://www.acne.org/), though questionable at times, is worth reading through for more info. It also has user reviews of every product, home remedy and other treatment, both internal and external. [This thread](http://www.acne.org/messageboard/index.php/topic/102347-biggest-mistakes-people-make-to-treat-acne/) addresses a lot of the common mistakes you may be making. The forums CAN provide useful information like that, but be careful, what works for someone else may not work for you

You can get a reasonable amount of detail from those links (and more from checking Wikipedia/Google results for anything listed there)

*Benzoyl Peroxide (BP)*

* Examples: [Acne.org](http://www.danielkern.com/product-p/treatment-8.htm), but no other product effectively combines benzoyl peroxide and tea tree oil), [Oxy](http://www.oxyskincare.com/our-products/oxy-clinical-clearing-treatment/) (5% only), [ProActiv](http://www.proactiv.com)

Pros:

* Kills acne bacteria better than anything else you can get OTC
* Also has some keratolytic effects due to its skin peeling properties
* Widely available and commonly used

Cons:

* Dries out skin
* High sun sensitivity (use sunscreen)
* Bleaches clothes and sheets
* It can be harsh, I recommend trying a 2.5% product, as stronger ones have worse side effects, and there's little evidence that they're more effective.)

*Salicylic Acid / Beta Hydroxy Acid / BHA*

Examples: [Paula's Choice](http://www.paulaschoice.com/category/bha-aha-exfoliants)

Pros:

* Best exfoliant: helps remove dead skin and encourage new growth
* Unclogs pores and restores them to their healthy size/funtion
* Anti-inflammatory.
* Can and should be spread all over the face to improve appearance and smoothness

Cons:

* Sun sensitivity (always use sunscreen!)
* Still can't be used by some

*Other Exfoliant Info*

* Alpha Hydroxy Acids (usually glycolic or lactic acid) are an alternative if your skin can't tolerate BHAs
* Physical scrubs only exfoliate superficially, so these are not recommended. If you are going to go with a scrub, try to make it a fairly gentle one, or just use a washcloth with your cleanser.
* I don't want to advocate specific brands for the most part, so I would recommend getting them from Paula's Choice. They're the only brand that has a few different products with varying strengths (1%/2%) and bases (liquid/gel/lotion), so you can find the right fit for your skin type.
* Start by using them once a day, adjust the frequency based on how your skin responds.

*Tea Tree Oil*

Pros:

* [Functionally comparable to benzoyl peroxide.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2145499) 
* Doesn't have the drying or irritating side effects of BP

Cons:

* Weaker than BP; takes longer to work and may have a lower success rate.
* Lack of good tea tree products available
* Highly volatile

The best way to get around the poor availability of good products is to buy 100% tea tree oil, but I'm not sure if they block pores.) A few drops of jojoba can double as a light, noncomedogenic moisturiser, suitable even for oily skin. You don't really want to be using creams and lotions on oily skin anyway, as they risk making it oilier or clogging pores. I wouldn't rush to add TTO to other skin products, unless you just mix them in your hands before application. 

A similar product, rather than the Australian tea tree. I haven't heard much about this being used for acne, but if anyone has tried it, let me know how it went. It's possible that this is just as effective as tea tree, or more so, but either it's obscure because of the lack of studies on it, or has so few studies on it because it's obscure.

*Azelaic Acid*

Pros:

* Combines some of the antibacterial
* Generally well-tolerated
* Very effective for hyperpigmentation left behind by acne (currently considered a possible safer alternative to hydroquinone for skin lightening)

Cons:

* Poor availability: Whether it's OTC or prescription-only varies with the country. So far, but if you do reach the point of needing prescription topicals, this is a really good one to try anyway.
* Some people may have bad side effects
* Relative lack of research into its usage, so it's hard to assess how good it is.

Remember that any of these will most likely take several weeks to start working, then if it doesn't do enough on its own, try combining it with tea tree oil or BP. Azelaic acid is a great alternative, if you can get access to it. If these fail, you may want to see a doctor or dermatologist for stronger options. Before you do any of this, though, I recommend reading through the next few sections that cover how to look after your health, which may save you needing to go further or spend more money.

I did away with the version numbers, or heavily edited, and I've changed the structure a bit as well. 

If I feel a need to do another significant revamp, as there's a lot that we can still do to improve this one. In particular, the appendices, which are in separate comments so that people can reply to each one with their discussions/suggestions/requests, haven't had much done yet.

One thing I've taken a lot more care with this time around is providing actual sources that allow you to see where a lot of this information came from - at the very least, and having sources allowed me to be more precise and confident, as well as to fill in details I'd missed. I haven't done this for everything, but most points that I felt really needed citations now have them.

Anyway

# ***Introduction: An Acne Reading List***

Most of us have gotten a lot of useful life tips from reddit, and no one simple thing is going to change that. Acne is caused and helped by different things for different people. The root cause isn't dirty skin, so slight hygiene improvements can only help so much. Generally speaking, what works for someone else won't necessarily work for you, and sometimes, most of the things that SHOULD work don't. Some of us deal with constant frustration, trying countless products over months and years. I always found that even the best ones weren't enough, and it's no easy feat to distinguish the good advice from the baseless crap found on most acne-related websites.

This guide was started as an attempt to sort through the nonsense and actually give people useful information, there is no miracle product or easy fix. You need to understand a lot more about skin care and acne before you can understand how to treat your own problems, and the approach you take to treating it will depend a lot on your own skin, the nature of your acne, and the underlying factors making it worse.

You might expect a guide like this to start off with an explanation of what acne is, there are a thousand other acne websites and guides and posts across the Internet that already do this, and many of them do it better than I could. Before continuing, I recommend reading over at least some of the below pages to get a good sense of how and why acne occurs. This is a good way to get into the right mindset when it comes to treating it, and avoid a lot of common mistakes and misconceptions. 

* [acne.org](http://www.acne.org/about-acne.html) has a lot of info, and of how he thinks acne should be treated, while understating the potential of alternatives and the role of things like diet.) Also see [this forum post detailing common mistakes](http://www.acne.org/messageboard/index.php/topic/102347-biggest-mistakes-people-make-to-treat-acne/).)

1360483496.0,188mha,I've had acne for a long time and finally cured it. Here's a huge post of guidelines to follow that will probably cure yours too.,ljktklrjht,155,28,24,"Basically

Also, avoiding common skin irritants just makes choosing products easier.

About me: I'm a 20 year old male who had acne for 6 or so years and spent a lot of time researching how to beat it. I obtained a lot of knowledge from reddit so I felt like giving back. I'm on a throwaway so feel free to upvote for visibility so we can cure everyone's acne.

Without further adieu..

* Change your pillowcase daily. If you're poor just buy a bunch of cheap white towels from Walmart. If you're lazy just rest your head on clean shirts. Also if you flip it over you can get a couple uses out of it.
* Dyes and perfumes irritate many peoples skins. Choose a detergent without these chemicals when doing the wash.
* Don't use a fabric softener. Can be irritating.
* Avoid dairy. This one actually cured my acne. I didn't eat much cheese but when I stopped my face completely cleared up. If you search [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) you will see a lot of studies showing a link between dairy and acne. Again
* The other dietary link to acne for some people is food high on the glycemic index. The glycemic index measures how quickly blood sugar levels rise after eating some food. Basically
* Try to use lukewarm water. Very hot and very cold water irritates and dries out the skin. Contrary to popular belief
* While I'm on the subject
* Don't overwash your skin. For most people washing their face twice a day works best. With others once a day is actually better. However
* Prefer chemical exfoliation over manual. AHA's like Glycolic Acid and Lactic Acid and BHA's like Salicylic Acid are generally considered superior to physical exfoliation products because they don't irritate the skin (kill acne with kindness). A lot of people prefer BHA's for their anti-inflammatory properties.
* Prefer low concentrations of chemicals. Benzoyl Peroxide (BP) kills Propionibacterium acnes
* Is acne only at one spot on your face? Only your shoulders or forehead
* Drink a lot of water. I'm sure you've heard this before in many different contexts. It's human fuel. 3 days without and you're done. Drink more water. How do you know if you're drinking enough? Your pee should be clear instead of yellow.
* Have a healthy diet. Acne is mostly caused internally and shows itself externally. You're probably deficient in Vitamin D and Omega 3 fatty acids, hats, and take Vitamin D supplementation for optimal health. You can pretty much only get sufficient Omega 3's from a fishy diet and expensive grass-fed meats so I just supplement it instead. I only supplement Vitamin D and Fish Oil because even with an *okay* diet you're probably only deficient in those two things.
* If you move around a lot during sleep and your face is rubbing against a harsh fabric or oils it could irritate your skin. Try sleeping on your back with proper pillow positioning to maintain a neutral spine. Personally I have a bad back so I have to sleep on my side and just try not to move around too much.
* Don't touch your face. Your hands, or at least oily and greasy. The only time you touch your face is while you're washing your face and are cleansing/exfoliating/moisturizing/whatevering.
* Don't pick at your skin or squeeze parts of your skin. The only time you should really do this is after you've washed your hands during your skincare routine and should only attempt it if it's ready to pop and you only need to apply a small amount of pressure in order to release it.
* Don't use any product that clogs your pores. [Here's a list](http://www.beneficialbotanicals.com/facts-figures/comedogenic-rating.html) of comedeogenic ratings for products. Comedeogenic just means tendency to clog pores. This list doesn't mean that something with a 4 will definitely clog your pores though (depends on skin type/genetics/etc). Some people are fine with coconut oil
* Use a moisturizer if your skin is dry. How do you know if your skin is dry? Well
* Cleanse your skin during your skin care routine. During the day and night bacteria accumulates, oils are gathered, and products (make-up, sunscreen, moisturizer, etc.) are applied. It's just like brushing your teeth. Twice a day and feel fresh.
* Exfoliate, for example. Works great for the rest of your body too.
* Avoid the sun. Other than sunlight basically being carcinogenic by UVA and UVB radiation mutating DNA and causing skin cancers and [premature aging](http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim/2012/06/04/trucker-damage-face_web_620x350.jpg) but its ""positive"" effect on acne is mostly an illusion. After getting a tan acne may be less visible but that's just because your skin was damaged and is darker so it's harder to see. The reason why I said mostly is because sometimes sunlight can legitimately help acne by killing acne-causing bacteria with UV rays. Can be a decent short-term solution though.
* Use a moisturizer if you're going to be hit by harsh winds. Also
* I generally like to avoid expensive products. Most of acne is caused by something already mentioned and most fixes are free and those that aren't can be purchased cheaply. Shea butter, sugar, gentle cleansers, and other basic skin care products are cheap. Even if something expensive does work, do you really want to depend on that forever? Don't be swindled in to the artificial markup. All the ingredients used in most formulations are cheap and massively produced. Other than for cleansing, I like to use single ingredients for skin-care.
* If you don't feel like researching ingredients, fragance-free, and paraben-free. Just note that these aren't really regulated and the effectiveness of a product is based on its ingredients and their proportions.
* Almost forgot to mention hormones. Changes and fluctuations with hormones can affect your acne. Women on their period
* Avoid stress. It sound weird but stress can cause acne and other conditions. Acne can be mainly hormonal and stress can effect your androgen and cortisol levels which can lead to sebum production, avoiding negatives emotions, and stay relaxed.
* When in the shower, oils and debris from your hair is washed off and drips down all over your face and the rest of your body. Generally, I like to do a top-down approach when showering to avoid this issue, however minor it may be.
* Avoid large amounts of makeup and the use of many different products. A lot of women cover up their bad skin with makeup and in turn just make their skin worse with all the products clogging their pores. It's a vicious cycle. You'd be surprised how well a good moisturizer and proper skin care can replace blush
* Visit /r/wicked_edge if you believe your acne to be partially caused by improper shaving techniques. Basically
* Use one towel for drying your hair and one towel for drying your body. Keep them separated so you can keep the oils separated as well.
* Pat your skin dry instead of vigorously rubbing it dry. After your shower wipe all the dripping water off of you with your palms so not as much will be absorbed in to your towel so they stay cleaner for longer.
* Exercise daily but try to do it at a time before when you normally shower. For example
* Accutane, lips, mouth, etc. It can also cause liver problems, depression, birth defects if taken during pregnancy, etc. Talk to a professional if nothing else works.
* If you've tried everything and even bit the bullet and tried Accutane for its entire course and still nothing you still have an option. Waiting. A lot of acne is hormonal and will eventually clear up on its own

This past summer break I had my worst case of acne so far, school started (senior year) and my acne-shit storm had still not gone away leaving me even more depressed as no one in school had acne as bad (that I could see it was pretty ridiculously bad). To top it off I was staying up really late often making my acne worse. 

Now I've preached in other threads and to my friends, then I started doing something I'd heard about from a facial lady. Icing. Icing acne, as well as taking cold showers is super beneficial at lessening reddening and swelling. So after a week of doing that I found it made a nice difference, but it was STILL not enough. So then I had an epiphany, I tried to think back to the most recent time when I had had flawless skin and what my environment was like. Turns out my environment played a huge factor because the last time I had perfect skin was just before 8th grade during a summer vacation to a tropical beach in Mexico. The weather was extremely hot and I was sweating all the time but I was also swimming in the clear blue salt water every day I was there. I tended to swim in the afternoon when the sun was down so I didn't get sunburned.

Anyhow, sea salt water acts as a natural antiseptic and cleans and sterilizes wounds.......acne is a wound right? Yup, an open fucking gaping wound. Hmmm.... Anyhow after some experimenting I figured out the best way to apply salt water to my acne, via spray bottle. I use a small 4 oz. glass spray bottle that I sterilized in boiling water but it was my only option as every other spray bottle in my house had some form of cleaning agent in it (And it's hard to sterilize plastic bottles). A few things also, salt is drying so it's best to drink lots of water so your skin hydrates itself, if you want to see the best effects drink at least 20 oz. of water at least 8 times throughout the course of a day (not all at once) to hydrate yourself effectively. Spray as much as you want but suck in your lips and keep your eyes closed so you don't dry out your lips and burn your eyes. Furthermore, the saltwater does not heal your skin the way you might think, it actually exfoliates and sterilizes. This means that it will squeeze your pimples for you and you don't have to do anything other that spray. In the first day of use I noticed a few whiteheads being pulled up. But after washing off the salt with cold water much of the crap gets washed off. It gets better every day afterwards. It took just over a week to completely get rid of my acne but because I'm still new to the idea of having perfect skin (having not had it since I was 10) I still spray my skin at least once a week now (usually on weekends).

If you have anymore questions on my routine just ask away (I'm sure I've left out a few things but nothing too big)

TL;DR: Salt water spray cured my acne

EDIT: I knew I'd forgotten something: Be sure to use only unrefined sea salt that has no additives in it       (use ONLY sea salt). I use coarse sea salt from Whole Foods but probably any will work, or E535 (Sodium ferrocyanide) in it. 

EDIT: If you want to increase the effectiveness of the salt water, then spraying myself, then steaming for 5 more mins and spraying again and air drying (while drinking lots of water of course) helped immensely to speed my recovery.",,False,,t5_2qse3,,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/15vo6r/ive_found_a_possible_not_the_cure_for_acne_mine/

*disclaimer* Long time lurker, stubborn, and chronic form of acne, comedones, and inflammation. This is my story of discovery.

Twenty-four year old male having suffered from mild, sensitive skin, and moderate food/airborne seasonal allergies. Years ago my initial breakouts began in the ""T-zone"" specifically blackheads on and surrounding my nose. The war-zone then expanded to whiteheads and blackheads on my brow, and a malicious mix of cystic acne and whiteheads on my cheeks and jawline. I also broke out behind my ears with large milia-like, hard, non-inflammatory nodules. I am a clean and hygienic person and use fresh towels, one for face only one for body, and do my best to avoid touching my face throughout the day. I was always baffled by my recurring problem and assumed others were misjudging my condition as a biproduct of sloth and uncleanliness. 

Years of dermatologist appointments racked up costly bills as well as exposure to extremely powerful medications that I naively took in good faith from a doctor. In truth, duac and clindamycin, I was routed toward using Rx pills such as Minocycline, Doxycycline, and Tetracycline in conjunction with the topicals. Every time I changed antibiotics my skin improved for a few weeks before rapidly deteriorating into scar-inducing cystic breakouts. 

In 2004 at my dermatologist's recommendation went on my first regimen of Accutane. I read the labels and warnings but was assured only a small percentage of patients ever experience these side-effects and that the drug was ""pretty much"" guaranteed to work. That half-hearted promise combined with the fact that every other treatment had failed led me to believe Accutane was to be my salvation. I've known people who truly benefitted from the drug but I want to share how it effected me. Within a few weeks my skin became dry and red, my eyes jaundiced and I experienced irregular sleep patterns as well as periods of manic depression. Did I tell anyone? No. Why? I was going to tough it out to FINALLY defeat my acne and the anxiety that came with it. I had regular blood work and was told everything checked out, that my side effects were normal. Anyway, after 5 months of soul-draining exposure to the drug, my skin was worse than before the treatment. The acne coverage was about the same, but my skin was thin and weak, hypersensitive, blotchy

 I went back to my usual regimen of a gentle wash and wallowed in self pity for over a year, where on some primal level I was determined to kill the condition myself if the medications couldnt. The subsequent scarring and lack of progress is still regrettable to this day. So I found myself sitting, slouched and defeated flipping through random magazines in the dermatologist's waiting rooms listening to the pages flip-over without reading a word, feeling broken. At that point I would have dunked my face in an acid bath and hid in a cave for a year if I could emerge blemish free but instead was misguided to a regimen far worse. A second round of Accutane. 

This time the dermatologist had concrete numbers for me, so instead of thanking God, I thank the cheap manufacturing process that caused the belt to snap at the buckle on the way down. It is also important to say that this was undoubtedly the most selfish thing I have ever done. I hit the ground and kneed myself in the jaw. Spitting blood I thought of all the people I would have heart and all the painful questions they'd be asking, likely to arrive at the wrong conclusion. A few months before I was a witty, engaged and humorous person, aware of my physical eyesores, upset by them, neurotic introspection I experienced during my second course led me to live a quiet secluded life of hermitage and hopelessness. 

I haven't told anyone I know about this struggle and the severity of my own actions and I thank this forum and its members for giving me the courage to discuss it and I implore others to seek out someone to talk to if they find themselves as wayward as I was. Also

The battle continues...

After picking myself up off the ground, minerals, and natural health supplements. I was convinced the problem was internal (where else could this pus, inflammation, and gunk be coming from) and also realized if my wounds and scars were going to heal efficiently I needed to create the ideal nutrient climate in my system. I started with a high protein, high-fiber, high anti-inflammatory/alkaline diet combined with tons of water (with lemon juice) and exercise and gradually moved towards supplementing with additional items. I also recognized that I broke out worse after taking long hot showers or eating certain foods the days before

I started experimenting, Zinc, Copper, Vitamin D, Potassium, vitamin A, vitamin C, Selenium, Biotin, though less severe

I maintained that strategy for a few years but still would wake up every morning to at least one or two new whiteheads and a scattering of blackheads on my nose and brow,manuka honey, lavender oil, baking soda, castor packs and ice baths and though wound healing and recovery time was expedited, the underlying cause was still at work. 

Then in a collision of coincidences I made my discovery. It was a combination of reviewing a copy of my medical records which noted several ear infections as a child. While I was sick with a sinus infection I studied the anatomy of sinus passages and discovered chronic sinusitis is actually a yeast infection/candida overgrowth. This can be worsened by long term effects of exposure to antibiotics. Drumroll please....the literal and figurative underlying cause to my chronic acne was my sinuses!

I realized when looking at a diagram of sinus passages that the most prevalent breakout regions on my face were directly above/surrounding my sinuses. My cheeks, temples, behind my ears/neck. I found myself excitedly asking, could I have developed a resistant infection (possibly gram negative/yeast combo + allergy aggravated) in my sinuses that stubbornly resided at varying capacities depending on the strength of my immune system (i.e. flare ups during flu-season / better skin in summer when swimming in/accidentally inhaling ocean salt water) Was this my eureka moment?

I immediately went to the store and bought a ""Neil Med"" sinus rinse set (there are other kinds but this one gives you the ability to slightly pressurize the flow of the solution) which included the non-iodized salt and baking soda packets. Using filtered water I started the process. Much to my dismay I expelled heaps of dark green and brown sludge from deep within my sinus cavities over the next two days. Followed by three days of yellow goo. Followed by a mixed clear/yellow/chunky debris and then nothing but the cleaning solution itself. The result, smell better, taste finer notes of foods, speak more clearly with deeper resonance, and slept like a hibernating bear. I combined that two time a day rinse regimen (three to start) with a Yeast-Fighters supplement. The supplement contains a Fiber Blend (psyllium husk, guar gum, apple pectin, Garlic Bulb Extract, echinacea

Overall result of this ten year investigative and perilous journey has been a success. I can feel my skin beginning to normalize, and exercise. When I do get an occasional pimple or exhumed residual cyst I take a warm shower, carefully extract the core (only when ready) then ice the area or run cold water over my face for a few minutes. I then pat dry and apply tea tree and lavender oils as a spot treatment.

As for the scarring of old, high in Vitamin A, C, E and essential fatty acids(linoleic, linolenic, oleic, palmitic, pat onto slightly damp skin (better to ice/cool your face beforehand to increase effectiveness) allow to soak in for a few minutes then gently pat/blot the excess oil. I cannot express how grateful I am for this product and its effectiveness. As a retinoid

Well it appears my story here has come to an end

Topical/prescription
------------------------

Benzoyl peroxide - didn't work

Clindamycin - actually worked for 1.5 years

Minocycline - Took it for 3 months - it slowed down my acne, so I stopped.

Differin - worst medication I ever took - made skin plastic-y

Benzamycin - effective

--------
Natural
-----------

Weekly steam + mask - Doesn't make a difference

Eggs - Ditto

Honey - Ditto

Eating raw garlic - took it for a month or 2 - it doesn't do much
(it makes your blood thinner)

Zinc + other vitamins - Resulted in a severe breakout (worst of my life) when I decide to take about 3-4 different pill types all at once (zinc

Olive oil on face - Went through a phase of not using lotion

Not washing my face with a cleanser - Severe dryness after 2 weeks.

----------------------------------------------------------

What worked:
---------------------

Reducing sugar intake - This was my number one cause for acne.

Eating things that only a caveman could eat  - Better food = healthier you.

Changing bed sheets/pillow sheets weekly - Definitely helped.

Drinking lots of water - Definitely helps.

Exercising - Ditto.

Reducing stress

Lemon juice - Put it on my scars in the winter

Drinking lemon juice - did it in the mornings on an empty stomach....doesn't stop pimples

Putting any OTC medicine on problem spots while making sure I followed the rest of the above list.

-------------------------------------------

My recommendations: 

I realize that what worked for me won't work for everyone...but if you notice

The one thing that I did which helped me narrow things down as to why I got pimples was to keep an Acne journal. Every day, etc.

That way I could narrow down what triggered it for me. Ultimately, I'll break out) was my main issue.

I've always been a firm believer that acne occurs due to fundamental internal problems...whether that is a vitamin deficiency or an inability to digest certain things. Its upto you to find out exactly what your body cannot tolerate. Unfortunately

---------------------------------------

TL;DR - Moderate-mild acne since 14. Got new pimples almost every day. Eventually figured out root cause for acne and took more natural preventative measures.

Physically, it was quite clear that my acne was cystic: anyone with this type knows how painful a burst pimple can be. Although I tried getting rid of it through soaps, lotions and masks, nothing worked. If anything, those products aggravated my acne.

It's important to note that I've never been a healthy fellow. Always a finicky eater, on my nineteenth birthday, I decided to better my lifestyle. My motivation wasn't to rid myself of acne (it didn't affect me much) but instead to become muscular, fit, and healthy.

Without further ado

- **The weather turned warmer.** I'm from the northern midwest

- **Exercise, I lift weights for twenty minutes.

- **Keep a clean face.** Every few hours

- **Don't let your hair touch your face.** Between showers, so I avoid it.

- **Ditch the pillow.** I stopped using a pillow completely. I just have a mattress with clean sheets, my head rests on my arm, greatly reducing the surface area where my face is touched, or I sleep on my back.

- **Diet.** Before changing my lifestyle, but I stuff the food down my gullet anyway. My diet now is very high in nuts and fruits (trail mix is a favorite) with at least one undressed salad every day. For example, for breakfast I might eat a four-egg cheese omelet, toasted bagel with butter, peanut butter sandwich, banana, and glass of milk.

- **Take a multivitamin.** -- It's important not to miss any nutrients

- **Cut the sugar

- **Drink plenty of water.** When biking

- **Quit drinking alcohol.** Before, after which some pimples appeared). When you get drunk and pee like a racehorse, your body becomes quite dehydrated. Not only does your body get a nasty hangover, but your skin also dries out.

- **Abstain from sex and masturbating.** I know, but I felt it was worth mentioning. (Side-note: good luck keeping a girlfriend.) Amazingly, I feel sharper mentally, just like George Costanza in that one episode of Seinfeld.

After all these things, which leads me to my final point.

- Apply a 1:1 mixture of **apple cider vinegar** and water with a cotton ball. After my morning shower I moisten my face with this

I still have mild scarring from all those years with acne

My acne was mostly a symptom to my bad habits. By changing the way I live my complexion has never been clearer

---

Most of us have gotten a lot of useful life tips from reddit, what works for someone else won't work for you, and sometimes most of the things that SHOULD work don't. I know that pain, having tried numerous products over the past few years, and finding that even the best ones don't help, or lead to more problems. It's made especially hard because the Internet is filled with misinformation and ignorance about how to treat acne, and it can be nearly impossible for most people to distinguish the good advice from the baseless crap that makes up 90% of acne-related websites. 

I've tried to extract the useful information from all this, and what you do will depend on your skin type and the nature of your acne.

**The Basics**

First, and most of the treatments available for it. [Acne.org](http://www.acne.org/) is worth reading through for more info, as well as user reviews of every product and treatment, both internal and external. [This thread](http://www.acne.org/messageboard/index.php/topic/102347-biggest-mistakes-people-make-to-treat-acne/) addresses a lot of the common mistakes you may be making. The forums CAN provide useful information, but also a lot of unreliable advice and anecdotes. Remember, what works for someone else may not work for you, and sometimes people make mistakes when assessing their own results.

I suggest you read through those links, but not everyone can tolerate it, as it can be drying/irritating. Salicylic acid (beta hydroxy acid/BHA) is the best exfoliant, with AHAs as a possible alternative. Physical scrubs are less effective, as they don't exfoliate deep enough into the pore, and you also risk scrubbing the acne on your face, which should always be avoided. I don't want to advocate specific brands for the most part, so I would recommend Paula's Choice. They have a few different products with varying strengths (1%/2%) and bases (toner/gel/lotion)

A lot of people are scared of these ingredients, I'm not a fan of it, as I have sensitive skin.) But salicylic acid is actually an anti-inflammatory, and it's less harsh than washing your face with an abrasive scrub. It can and should be used all over your face, not as a spot treatment (spot treatments do little to stop acne). Salicylic acid addresses acne at its roots by preventing pores from becoming blocked or enlarged, restoring their normal function. It's extremely effective against blackheads and whiteheads. It also has several benefits for your skin's health and appearance, making it smoother and more even, though, don't use them. I'd start by trying just salicylic acid, you should be using sunscreen during the day (covered below).

As an alternative, but doesn't have the side effects of BP. There aren't really any good tea tree products around, though (it's mainly used by ""natural"" brands that also use irritating ingredients), so actually trying to use it is frustrating. Your best bet may be to buy pure tea tree oil and dilute it to 5% (i.e. 1:19) in a carrier oil, such as jojoba. (Camellia oil is also great for your skin, but I'm not sure if it blocks pores.) This also doubles as a light moisturiser, so use it right after washing your face to retain the moisture in your skin. If you have oily skin, as they'll just leave it greasy and potentially clog pores. As a side note

Women: you're in the fortunate position of being able to use birth control pills, I'm stuck with my unlucky hormones, so I don't know much about this.

**Skin Care**

So, or it just caught your eye on a store shelf. The first thing you want to know is if the product's claims are true, or just marketing bullshit. Check its review on [Beautypedia](http://www.beautypedia.com/) first (I'd love to know about any other comprehensive professional review sites, but I don't think there are any). You can also do advanced searches based on your skin type and the type of product you're looking for, giving you a list of options to check out. Their ""best products"" lists are a good starting point, but it's worth looking at others as well. If the brand you're looking for isn't there (more likely if you're outside America), you can look up ingredients on [Cosmetics Cop](http://www.cosmeticscop.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/A.aspx), or just more information on something you're unsure of.

I cannot stress this enough, which block pores or irritate their skin, leading them into a cycle of worse and worse acne. And yes, anything can be doing this - it doesn't matter if it says ""non-comodegenic"" or ""hypoallergenic"" or ""natural"", because those terms are not regulated or strictly defined. They're basically marketing lingo made to convince you that you're getting something safe. While acne is related to hormones, many other things can exacerbate it by increasing sebum production. If you have sensitive skin, just about anything could be a culprit, though

Start by using as few products as possible, and if you have dry areas of skin, a moisturiser. If you have oily or combination skin, you can use a toner (alcohol-free) as a very light moisturiser, as you ideally still want something to restore your skin's balance after washing off its natural oils. Remember, breakouts won't happen overnight, as acne can take weeks to form below the surface. This makes it very hard to actually identify whether something new is helping or hurting, don't be fooled by claims of ""purging"". If you get *worse*

For men, which isn't helped by the fact that these blades encourage you to rush and to push too hard on the skin. Two blades will lead to fewer problems than five blades. Better yet, though, check out /r/wicked_edge and get yourself a double edge safety razor. This takes some getting used to (you pretty much have to relearn how to shave), but gives you much more precise control, and a smoother, gentler shave. It's also much cheaper. Just be wary of the fact that most shaving soaps/creams contain fragrance, or other irritants

**Background

I saw a dermatologist two years ago, an antibacterial lotion, and antibiotics. The prescribed products did wonders on my skin, and I was clear in 3 months. The problem? The cost of the four prescriptions were $350/month, even after insurance. I had to stop using the products, switched to a cheaper alternative like Proactiv, and my acne came back

I went back to my dermatologist and told her I could no longer afford the prescriptions. She recommended I use Hibiclens to wash my face

**What causes acne?**

In short, and bacteria. The reason I responded so well to my prescriptions was because the face wash, lotion, and antibiotics got rid of the bacteria on my face, while the retin a gel speeded up skin cell production and cleared dead skin cells clogging my pores. I had oily skin, which was solved because the products sort of ""dried out"" my skin, but really they were just making my skin normal.

**I've tried this and that

It is critical that you tackle all *three* causes--dead skin cells, and it didn't work, you probably have cystic acne (acne under the surface of your skin) which is caused *mainly* by bacteria. The main acne fighting ingredient in most over the counter treatments is benzoyl peroxide, which is not a *good* antibacterial ingredient. So while you speed up skin cell production, you're still left with oil and bacteria on your face! If you respond positively to Proactiv, which many do, you probably have very mild surface acne and normal to good skin, which is why most complete ""systems"" on the market won't work if you have moderate to severe acne.

**What works.**

I recommend three products

* Problem? Bacteria. Solution? [Hibiclens.](http://www.cvs.com/shop/product-detail/Hibiclens-Liquid?skuId=102994) - $10.79

This antibacterial wash is commonly used in hospitals and doctors offices, I recommend putting it in a foaming dispenser regardless, to get the most out of the product.

Just spread one or two pumps of it very gently on your face. It will start to get a little tacky

* Problem? Dead skin cells. Solution? [Benzoyl Peroxide.](http://www.danielkern.com/product-p/treatment-8.htm) - $16.52

Benzoyl peroxide will clear away dead skin cells, but your skin will get used to it. It's good to ease into it before using a lot, to reduce irritation.

I recommend this product because of the incredibly low cost. It's part of the [acne.org](http://www.ance.org/) regimen, video on how to use this product, shown [here.](http://youtu.be/7ZHy-W6xcec?t=2m57s) Just watch on the ""Step 2"" portion. It will start there for you.

Note: If you want a product you can pick up at the drug store as opposed to ordering online, the solution is 10% benzoyl peroxide as opposed to 2.5%, which can cause irritation. (Both 10% and 2.5% are proven to be just as effective. There is no benefit to using 10%.) It can be a good spot treatment though. 

* Problem? Oily skin. Solution? [Cetaphil Oil Control Moisturizer.](http://www.target.com/p/cetaphil-oil-control-moisturizer-spf-30-4-oz/-/A-14043848) - $12.75

It's important that you don't skip moisturizer, and even in flash photography pictures. :)

**In summary...**

The combination of these three products cleared my skin in one month without a single breakout. I no longer have to spend hundreds of dollars of prescriptions

While acne varies from case to case and response to these products will differ

**TL;DR**

Anyone who is my age and has acne knows how horribly embarrassing it is. I know acne is embarrassing at any age, it's freaking horrible. I felt so ugly all the time because of it and sometimes didn't want to leave the house or look at people. 

I tried everything and nothing worked. And I tried them for months to let them work. So I've spent the last several years reading and reading and reading and I learned a lot of things about skin. 

First off, and when you strip it away with harsh chemicals, your skin overcompensates by producing extra. 

The first thing I did was the ""caveman regimen"". Basically, I didn't touch my face at all. (More on that here http://www.thelovevitamin.com/3135/caveman-regimen/ ) 

Did it work? Not completely. BUT I did notice that the pimples I had would go away much faster and they weren't as red and aggravated. This lead me to believe I was on the right path. But my skin was really dry and flaking and I felt like I needed to exfoliate badly. 

So I switched to the Oil Cleansing Method. (More on that here:http://www.theoilcleansingmethod.com/ ) I know putting oil on your face sounds scary, my skin is so soft and healthy looking.

But wait, some birth control pills make acne worse) I take Sprintec which is 9 dollars at Target Pharmacy. I've only been taking the pills for about a month and my face is pretty amazingly clear. I've never been so happy in my life. 

But that's not all... I have no desire to take birth control pills for the rest of my life or for any real length of time, though it's a lot of work, but for me at least, it's 100% worth it. If you are interested in learning more about how to fix your hormonal acne through digestion, I HIGHLY recommend this book: http://purelyprimalskincare.com/?hop=grooveit

I have no money to be made in this, but I would've paid double for it, it's a huge book with a LOT of information in it. 

Changing your way of eating is NOT easy, I just remember how bad I feel when I have bad acne. Plus you get the added bonus of losing weight in a healthy way too! My plan is to wean myself off the birth control pills once I have been eating well enough that I believe I have fixed my hormones on my own. 

So right now I do the OCM every day, no sugar at all. My acne is virtually cured, seriously, after one month. After a few months, I'm going start taking only half a pill every day to wean myself off and then hopefully, all my problems should be solved. 

Again, and you've fought with acne for years, and you've tried everything, and you just don't know what to do anymore, I SERIOUSLY can't recommend this enough! Hope it helps someone.

My comment on there has been lost among the thousands of others but that lead me here.  I wanted to post how I cured my acne because I found out about it through word of mouth and I hope I can help someone else in the same way.  

Pantothenic Acid (Vitamin B5) in high doses available from most health stores. If you search Google there's loads of discussion about it.  There's a scientific study where they talk about coenzyme-a but it basically boils down to B5 being the solution.

I had the worst acne imaginable from the age of 16 onwards. I was on antibiotics for 3 years until they were no longer effective and then when I came off them I had the worst break-out I've ever had.  That's when I found out about B5 from someone I met who saw how bad my skin was.  It took about 6 months to completely clear up but all I was doing was taking a vitamin that I'm guessing I was deficient in.  It seems to good to be true but it genuinely worked for me.  

The way I understand it is that your body needs Pantothenic Acid (vitamin B5) to produce hormones and enzymes. If your diet is short of B5 or your body isn't good at synthesising it then your body cannot produce enough enzymes to break down the oils that otherwise end up on your face resulting in acne.

I understand this as being why teenagers usually get acne. Their bodies are producing tonnes of hormones which use up the B5 leaving your body short of it for the enzymes.

I was taking 5g a day (10 x 500mg tablets). This has a delayed reaction of 1-2 months so you have to be patient. Drink tonnes of water with it and take a biotin tablet a day too as I found this helped.

Once my skin was clear I slowly dropped the dose down over the years to 500mg a day which is what I take now and my skin is clear.

Smoking and drinking reduces the effect of the B5 so are best avoided.  Eating less fat obviously helps too because there's less oil to end up on your face.

Any questions about it are welcome.  I'd love to hear someone find this as their solution.  Accutane and antibiotics are so bad for your body.  The only side effect I had from B5 was extremely sensitive teeth.

•Olive oil-steam-scrub procedure
•40% glycolic peel (I did at home)

None of which worked. Luckily I read an article on MSM cream (you've probably seen it before but that's not all you use so keep reading). 
MSM cream helps restore the collagen in your skin (your acne scars). Now alone

Then I came across this miracle tool called a dermaroller. It's basically a bunch of needles on a small hand-held tool that you roll on your face. 

Using both the dermaroller and MSM cream has made a visible difference in a week.


Here's what you need:
MSM cream
Dermaroller (Size: 1.5)

Every morning wash your face. Apply MSM cream and topical cream (if you use one)

Every night wash your face. Use dermaroller all over your face

It's cheap and very effective. If you suffer from scarring

1364498807.0,1b70lm,Tips for getting rid of red marks,amiraclelife,28,4,12,"** A mild to moderate breakout often leaves a red, they are really post-inflammatory hyper-pigmentation marks, even-toned skin! **

#1: Use only well-formulated, which impedes your skin's ability to heal itself. Scrubs tear into the skin, delaying healing, and products with irritating ingredients also impede healing. Stick to the products we've reviewed and recommended on Beautypedia (or look up ingredients in our research-based Ingredient Dictionary). Of course, all Paula's Choice products are formulated to be gentle and they are all free of irritants.

#2: Use an AHA or BHA exfoliant daily. The benefits of a well-formulated AHA or BHA, active ingredient salicylic acid) used daily not only exfoliates the surface of the skin but also penetrates oil so it can reach inside the pore, dissolving the clogs that lead to breakouts. BHA is also a potent anti-inflammatory that reduces redness. Thus, in one step, you reduce the likelihood of developing a breakout and you speed the fading of the post-acne marks you have now.

Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs, just like a BHA. However, AHAs cannot penetrate oil and exfoliate inside the pore like BHA, so they are not as adept at treating breakouts or clogged pores.

#3: Use a broad-spectrum SPF 15+ product every day, making healing slower and less efficient. Protecting your skin from UV exposure every day is critical to fading discolorations, plus it keeps your skin healthier-looking longer!

Paula's Choice has several excellent SPF-rated daytime moisturizers for any skin type! For the face

Looking for an all-over formula for face and body? Try Paula's Choice Extra Care Non-Greasy Sunscreen SPF 50+ or Peter Thomas Roth's Uber-Dry Sunscreen Cream SPF 30.

You also can consider combining a foundation or tinted moisturizer rated SPF 15+

#4: Use products loaded with antioxidants and cell-communicating ingredients. Those two categories of beneficial ingredients—antioxidants and cell-communicating ingredients—help defend your skin from further damage, and/or moisturizer formulated with a variety of these ingredients (and in stable packaging; that is, no jars or clear containers) is the best way to get their skin-repairing benefits.

Some types of cell-communicating ingredients, in addition to other complexion improvers like vitamins C and E!

#5: Consider professional help. Research shows that post-inflammatory pigmentation—red or brown discolorations where a breakout once was—responds well to a series of Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) treatments. So, and need the discolorations gone sooner than a skin-care routine can accomplish, IPL treatments may be your solution (for those with deeper skin tones, speak with your dermatologist about alternatives laser options to the IPL.) Another option is prescription tretinoin, (Retin-A, Renova), as is a monthly BHA or AHA peel performed by a cosmetic dermatologist.

For true acne scars (the pitted, no skin-care product can reverse their appearance. Dermal fillers can plump up the indentations, and you can combine dermal fillers with AHA or BHA peels or a series of fractional laser treatments for best results.

Microdermabrasion also is an option,,False,,t5_2qse3,False,,True

I'm sure it goes without saying that over the past ten years I've used EVERY prescription and otc drug, and cream available. Except Accutane. Can't believe that this is finally what worked...

So here are the major changes I've made in the last few months that may have helped:

- I don't eat wheat or highly processed foods. I tried cutting out dairy for a couple of months

- I wash with Johnson &amp; Johnson Purpose face wash. I do this 2-3 times a day.

- After I wash my face

- I stopped touching my face almost entirely. I used to scratch and pick a lot. This was a very hard habit to break but damn it was helpful.

- Also for the past two weeks I've been doing the raw honey treatment for twenty minutes a day. It's messy and sticky but seems to make my skin very soft and I haven't had a pimple since I started doing it.

- Drinking TONS of water. 2-4L a day.

So I wanted to share with you guys my lovely ongoing acne journey.  If this helps even one person then I'll be happy.  There's a lot of text

**BEFORE situation**

I'm 22 and all throughout college (and HS) my face was always flaring up.  Up until this past spring, and other public places with 1 or 2 big ass bumps (and a handful of smaller spots + uneven colored skin) on my face.  I'd have one or two large spots and try to ""kill"" the spots with things like BP, Salicylic Acid, different aspirin and lemon masks etc (you know the drill).  These bumps would get less noticeable in 2 or 3 days but by then those smaller bumps have caught up --&gt; rinse, repeat.  Then this past spring (late feb/ early march), my face decided to wage an all out war.  So this post is tell you guys how I got these bumps (mostly) under control

**BEFORE DIET**

Also I'm a fairly healthy and active person.  During the school year and most of my summers

* Morning: 4 egg whites + 1 yolk / cup of OATMEAL / apple or banana.  Or Fiber One CEREAL w/ milk.
* Snack: Some kind of cliffbar/luna bar with protein and CARBS
* Lunch: 2 chicken breasts /  brown RICE or whole grain SPAGHETTI / some veggies (broccoli
* Snack: Greek Yogurt w/ blueberries
* Dinner: PASTA / Chicken or beef or Salmon / WHEAT ROLL or other BREAD products / Salad

If funds were low, wontons, or dumplings (read: CARBS)

**BEFORE REGIMEN**

* Neutrogena Facial Wash during shower
* BHA Toner afterwards
* Mario Badescu Buffering Lotion &amp; Drying Cream for underground pimples/bumps
* Multi Vitamins
* Fish Oil
* Zinc

So.. fast forward to Mid/Late March.  Breakouts were still consistent except there were just more bumps and more redness now.  I was also getting more and more spots on my JAWLINE, commencement, and the release of Diablo 3 on my mind so I didn't really do anything about my skin.  It was bad, but at the time I was too preoccupied to care too much.  

It was only until late July (like around 7/20) that I did some thinking.  I figured that all these products never fix the ROOT CAUSE of acne.. they got rid of the 2 or 3 big pimples on the surface but the stuff is still growing underneath.  (plus if you think about it

I kept reading that acne and diet were related and I was sort of skeptical.  Then I realized that 1) cancer is mostly a man-made 21st century disease (the prevalence was very low in ancient times), you're muscles will grow.  FOOD is related to our BODY.  Imagine that.  

So I took a long look at my daily intake of foods and I realized I ate a lot of carbs.  To do a little test I went on a 3 day water fast on like 7/20.  During these 3 days I noticed that there weren't really any NEW blemishes on my face.  It was just the old ones that were there and some were healing.  and afterwards my diet was ONLY whole grain spaghetti and crackers / wheat thins and water to drink.  Boom. new blemishes immediately.  (my 7/28/12 pic is from the Saturday after I ate carbs for a whole week).  Note they weren't even bad carbs (no cookies, there were sure to be new breakouts coming.  I'm sure this would apply to all simple sugars and HFCS.  

**CURRENT DIET**

So starting the week after that (on 7/30) I literally went through my kitchen and threw out ALL of my wheat/grain products.  I also read somewhere that dairy caused acne in some people so I went ahead and eliminated that as well (I'm not really a fan of cheese and milk anyways).  Went to the grocery store and bought vegetables (fresh and a ton of frozen for their price/variety), cherries, plums, bananas, watermelon, NUTS (almonds, pistachios), chicken legs.  I used coconut oil and lemon juice to stir fry tuna and random veggies every day.  Didn't add extra sugar/salt/sauces.  Snacked on fruits and nuts.  Delicious.  I went out to an Italian restaurant the other night and did have like two rolls of bread but other than that I've been wheat free.  People said that carbs from rice/noodles/bread are what gives us energy to go about our day.  Well I've been eating fruits, and going to the gym.  Cool huh.

**CURRENT REGIMEN**

As for my regimen.  I STOPPED using BP and the BHA toner.  I only shower once a day and use only a tiny bit of the neutrogena cleanser (I used to shower up to 3 times or wash my face throughout the day with cleasers).  If I ever want to wash my face I'll just splash cold water on it and wipe with a clean paper towel.  Now I NEVER TOUCH my face or pick at it.  I use the Mario Badescu Buffering lotion on the spots where I've gotten a cystic pimple before which also feel like they might flare up again (you know those spots where the pimple comes back in the EXACT same spot probably due to picking).   I don't use the drying cream anymore.

Current supplements - Red Clover

At the moment I still have hyperpigmentation marks from the previous 8 or so years.  There's also an underground bump playing peekaboo with me on my temple.    If a small pimple/whitehead appears I don't do anything (the frequency and severity have definitely gone down).  After the shower I just dab a little buffering lotion and it goes away in 1 or 2 days.  I'm far from being in the clear but It's only been a month and I'm liking what I see so far.  Which is why I'm sharing my wheat-acne connection with you folks!  I hope I covered everything.. probably not

1. I wash my linens every week (I'm sure you've heard this)
2. I started to moisturize my face twice a day. I never used to moisturize before this as I thought my face was oily and did not need moisturizer
3. I completely cut out processed sugars and fast food. I can't remember the last time I went to Mcdonalds or any other fast food chain
4. Absolutely no soda and I keep juice at a minimum
5. I eat a piece of dark chocolate every morning
6. I cut out dairy. No milk
7. I eat a handful of almonds everyday
8. The night before, feel overwhelmed and opt for something quick on the go. 
9. I eat my iron pill with an orange every morning. A little later I take vitamin D
10. I make little notes to myself reminding myself of what my end goal is. I want clear skin and a healthy body. I try to keep positive and this keeps me away from slipping into eating bad food.
11. I  try my best to stay away from most dips and dressings. If I am to use a dressing I use balsamic vinegar and as a dip I have hummus. 
12. I wash my face with a cleanser called Fresh from Sephora. When I need to exfoliate I use an Ocean Salt scrub from LUSH. After I exfoliate I leave honey on my face for 20 minutes to get all that moisture back in. Or I just moisturize with my regular moisturizer. 
13. I exercise at least 4 times a week. I noticed that this improved my skin a lot and added a youthful glow back to my skin
14. When I go home from University
15. Once every 2 months I get a microdermabrasion
16.I also cut out bread from my diet. I do eat brown rice and quinoa. Just refuse to eat bread anymore. 

Basically I changed my lifestyle around to benefit my health all around. I want to have good self-esteem and good energy to get through my days.  A combination of these things cleared my skin. I'm now 22 and I don't really get spots. Maybe one or two around my period but that's about it. I'm not saying you need to try all of these things, especially for mild acne sufferers.

I know many of your first reactions to this will be “Oh big deal, ugly face. I had almost no social life outside of school and at school I only made friends with the other nerdy, unattractive kids. There were girls I liked and I would speak to them, but I would never dream that they would ever be interested in me. I realize now, that even then I could have asked them out and they would have said yes.

When I was in grade 12 nearing the end of high school, getting rid of the acne. I tried the various creams and later a few different treatments like tetracycline. None of them made any difference. But I did make new friends and I actively tried to be nice to everyone. Then there was this girl who was in my nerdy circle of friends. She saw potential in me and decided she wanted to date me. I was still so crippled by my lack of confidence she had to walk me through every step of the process. I am so grateful that she had the patience for me. She started the upward spiral. She helped me start the process of learning that my attitude and my positive qualities are far more important than my physical appearance. 

Although she opened my mind to the possibility of women being attracted to me, everything else in my life did not change. I still had good friends, I still dated and everyone treated me with respect. I even met my first serious girlfriend and my first love. She told me once “I would still love you even if you were one giant zit”. Also when I finished Accutane, and my acne got better, things still did not change. It took a long time to build my confidence to where it is now. It was not the cure-all I expected it to be.

The point I’m trying to make with this story is that acne never stopped me from getting what I want. It was always just my perception of myself. My negative self-image was the only thing holding me back. People do not care all that much how you look. If you are a positive

I've been suffering from acne since I was 15 ( or younger

&gt;My acne situation at the start of this routine was this: Acne(+sweat bumps) would come and go around my forehead and on my chin (+ areas below and around). I would get rid of this by cleaning my face twice a day with a gentle soap ( things like sacylic acid seemed to only make things worse) and using benzyl peroxide on the areas with acne. Few would pop up on my cheeks, but that's enough background information.

**My Routine**:

If you've been to this subreddit before, sweat, oils, acne bacteria and everything else on it from the nights before. It doesn't matter how well you clean your face, you're doing all the cleaning for nothing if your not sleeping on a clean pillow.

I'll be honest

* I am taking Zinc as a supplement. You can read what some people have said about taking Zinc as an acne treatment[ here.](http://www.acne.org/zinc-reviews/200/page1.html) You can also do some google searching. [It's also beneficial to your immune system when it comes to the common cold!](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/16/us-zinc-cold-idUSTRE71F3XI20110216) I haven't had any negative side effects, follow the directions so you don't overdose! Read up on dosage so you don't over do it. And keep in mind, many foods contain Zinc. This may or may not be helpful to you at all. I bought one bottle, and I plan on taking the described amount every day until I'm 100% clear and smooth, and then I will bring my dosage down because it's not healthy to take Zinc over a long period of time.


* In the morning after my shower I wash my face with [Aveeno Clear Complexion Foaming Cleanser](http://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Complexion-Foaming-Cleanser-6-Ounce/dp/B00006FRW9). Wash your face with what you like, but can dry your skin. Next, apply a [facial toner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toner_\(skin_care\)). I use [Alba's Hibiscus Facial Toner](http://www.amazon.com/Alba-Naturals-Hibiscus-Facial-Toner/dp/B00120VWSG), you'll just need to find something that works with your skin and within your price range. Immediately afterwards, apply a moisturizer! Yes, even if you're a guy. Trust me. If your face produces a lot of oil, you still want to apply moisturizer. Again, be sure to use moisturizer. Over time and usage, it could be a good idea. Personally

Prior to this I was just an average guy doing what high school guys did back then which was chasing girls and having a good time. Out of no where acne started to appear 

Things started to take a turn in my social life and I became another person. My confidence dropped dramatically and it affected everything I did. I was at the stage where I people around me were getting more distant and distant. I was always the nice guy that treated everyone with respect and never hurt anybody so I guess that kind of helped with people not being as judgmental. There was a kid during the lower grade who was constantly picked on because of acne and now I have acne which is twice as bad so that didn't really help my self esteem either. When friends called me out I constantly made excuses not to go because my acne was that bad. How could I have fun when I can't even smile without it hurting? How could I even ask a girl out when I can't even look at myself in the mirror? Things got pretty bad and I finally .went to a dermatologist who prescribed me Accutane. This was my hail Mary my one last shot if that didnt work I didn't know what else to do. I was ready to give up and throw the towel in.

6 months after the course I felt like a new person fired up for a new life a change in perspective on life.

Hi Tracy!

I really liked this post and thought I’d add one idea to it.

Some time ago I made a discovery (based on your main idea that stress = acne) about my internal dialog when it comes to facing the mirror. Although we can just ignore the mirror altogether in the hopes that we don’t stress as much about our acne

So how do we address the REAL issue of feeling miserable while looking at ourselves in the mirror and only seeing acne? How do we eliminate the stress of seeing yet another spot of red on our face?

The answer I found really changed things around for me (and I owe this discovery in part to you!).

The problem is, or we aren’t lovable, or one hundred other miserable stories. These stories tend to run our lives and have us racing ourselves to the mirror to get the latest update on the most recent acne.

So! The discovery I made was this: Love the acne.

I know it’s gonna sound a bit crazy at first, or really, of the person behind the acne, because the more you understand something, the more you love it.

The thing is, who’s been telling them-self they are ugly and unworthy of love, because really and simply, that person just wants to be loved. So that’s what we do. We give that person love.

And how do we give that person love?

Imagine for a moment the feeling of having someone you trust, exactly as you are. THAT’S the feeling you want to have when you look in the mirror. One of gratitude that someone could love you THAT much; a feeling of acceptance for who you are; compassion for the hurting person you see in the mirror every day. That kind of feeling is the OPPOSITE of stress – which is the opposite of acne!

So really, Tracy, but just a general “you” to each of us who fight it.

I think we need to accept the feelings we have about ourselves and tell ourselves it’s ok to feel the feelings of fear, and if we can accept them instead of fight them, we are a good step closer to living a happier life – and totally, finally free of acne!

Love from a distant fan

I'm here to inquire about how many of you have ever used these patches. Hydrocolloid patches are intended for burn victims. From Wikipedia:

&gt; The active surface of the dressing is coated with a cross-linked adhesive mass containing a dispersion of gelatin, forming a gel which is held within the structure of the adhesive matrix. The moist conditions produced under the dressing are intended to promote fibrinolysis, angiogenesis and wound healing, without causing softening and breaking down of tissue. The gel which is formed as a result of the absorption of wound exudate is not mobile and free running but held within the structure of the adhesive matrix. Most hydrocolloid dressings are waterproof, allowing normal washing and bathing.

-----------------------------

After years of trying just about everything, which popped open some of the acne on my face. This of course caused bleeding, irritation, etc. Try as I might to make it look manageable, I had to head to work. 

What followed was an excruciating morning meeting where 15 people were straight up staring at my acne. It was really scabby, *very* noticeable. Not good.

I was fucking pissed. I haven't looked this bad

I decided that what I was doing wasn't working

Ugh. 

**End of background / sob story**.

------------------------------

Eventually I settled on something I had heard about while my aunt was in the hospital for a pretty bad burn on her arm. The problem was, etc really slows down the healing process and apparently also causes excess scarring. 

Considering my problem was that I had exfoliated and caused puss / bleeding on the acne on my cheeks, Granuflex or Tegaderm -- three of the 'medical' brands I'd heard about. None of them had the sort of volumes I'd need. 

I was however able to found a product that is honestly just amazing. The aforementioned products are designed to treat burns

I opened up the outer cardboard box and inside was a **sterilized pouch**

The English directions on the back say

1) Clean and dry skin and hands thoroughly.  
2) Remove the film at the back of an acne dressing and cover it on the acne. Fix it tightly by pressing on the rim.  
3) Replace when the acne dressing turns white (indicating full absorption of secretion).  
4) Store unused acne dressing in a cool
5) The acne dressing should be applied before wearing make up.

I picked up three boxes of the stuff (it looked like there isn't much per box) and set on my way home. Got home

When you tear open the sterile paper, oil-free, etc etc and all the other marketing they claim will fix acne. I pressed a paper towl on to my face and peeled it off. I waited about a minute as some of the acne was bleeding / puss-y, then I used another paper towl to do the same thing. 

I rubbed in some OXY 10. 

I grabbed a pair of tweezers and sterilized the tips with rubbing alcohol

Then I watched a movie and went to bed. 

I'm here now to say that this is the most night and day difference I've ever had. I've tried every thing on the market short of Accutane (I value my colon

I have a few suggestions on why these patches may be so ridiculously successful: 

1) They trap bacteria-filled puss and blood that would otherwise spread the *Propionibacterium acnes* and *Staphylococcus epidermidis* bacteria.  
2) They suck puss and blood *out of* acne, inflamed' look.  
3) They prevent picking

---------------------------------

That's about it. I'm fucking ecstatic right now that I've found out such an amazing way to treat something that's not only been physically uncomfortable for all of my adult life

I'm only one day into this treatment. This post is almost certainly jumping the gun. This healing might only be temporary

I wanted to share this news with you fine ladies and gents on this subreddit...I sincerely hope that this is something that's gone under the radar in the incredibly frustrating and pseudo-scientific marketing-driven anti-acne industry

Well I have been on epiduo for 7 weeks now and nothing has fucking changed at all.I have brought this point up to my mom but she continues to bury her head in the sand by saying that my acne is getting better when it clearly isn't.  This whole ordeal has made me pretty fucking unhappy and has totally ruined my self confidence. I cant look other people in the eyes anymore and I now avoid going out and social situations like the plague due to my negative self image.

What makes it even worse is that when I look around at the people at my school and see their clear flawless skin it makes me fucking sick knowing that I have the worst acne in the entire school.

So I did a little experiment. I stopped using conditioner in the shower completely. Now, and the outbreaks weren't so bad.

1362071411.0,19ekrk,"I've had acne since I was 13, now I'm pretty much clear at 22. Occasional pimple but nothing unmanageable. Here's what worked for me: Acetyl-L Carnitine + Pantothenic Acid (B5) Combo and acne.org BP",t3hbwang,22,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/19ekrk/ive_had_acne_since_i_was_13_now_im_pretty_much/

Around 14 I would get minor cysts and a lot of whiteheads/papules/pustules. Didn't help my case by popping a large portion of them. Did a ton of research and tried a ton of over-the-counter products and home remedies

Acne was kept mostly in check in high school by using benzaclin and acne.org's 2.5% benzoyl peroxide gel. I'd have occasional flare-ups and periods of where it was really bad but generally speaking when I was on benzaclin I was okay. 

In college my acne was never a huge problem

I finally started exercising regularly when I was around 20 in preparation for Marine Corps Officer Candidate School (officer boot camp). I think this in conjunction with the 2.5% acne.org gel kept me clear for most of sophmore-junior year of college. 

However I went to OCS between my junior-senior year of college and it destroyed my face. The stress, just wanted to get through OCS. At some point in time I bought an OTC benzoyl peroxide but it didn't do much. After OCS my face was in pretty bad shape, maybe about 10-12 papules/pustules, whiteheads, and small cysts. My skin worsened until about October/November of my senior year. What worked as a miracle for me was Patricia Wexler's anti-acne wash (sadly I think it's discontinued). It was a salicylic acid wash that really started to clear me up. After about two weeks using that and acne.org's benzoyl peroxide gel I finally started clearing up. I'd still get the occasional inflamed pimple but nothing as bad as earlier that year.

I stuck with the regimen of Patricia Wexler's anti-acne wash in the morning, when all of a sudden I started to get crazy breakouts. I had no idea what was going on, and the original regimen I was on was no longer working. I was still exercising, drinking water, and eating relatively healthy.

The breakouts continued and one day I got a huge cystic pimple

I figured it was worth a shot. Some people on B5 take about 5-10 pills a day in order for it to work. I didn't want to take that many pills so I followed the route of pairing Vitamin B5 with Acetyl-L Carnitine to help with the absorption. I tried this regimen and immediately noticed my skin starting to calm down. Before I'd feel a new pimple forming nearly every day

Quickly my scars began to fade and this is the regimen I still use to this day. It's only two pills a day, and fairly inexpensive -- you can buy about a 3 month supply of the supplements from any nutrition store for about 30-40 bucks total (less if there are sales). This is the only method I've used that really attacks acne from it's source and prevents the pimples from forming in the first place. There's a ton of resources online if you google and there's even an MD who writes about the science behind it and also did a study on its efficacy. I highly encourage you all to do your research as I did to find the optimum dosage for yourself.

After starting the B5/Acetyl-L Carnitine regimen, I've gone a period of 4-5 days without taking them but noticed I started breaking out so I won't go any longer than that.

Here's my current regimen below:
AM: Patricia Wexler anti-acne scrub / Cetaphil facial wash
Shave with DE razor and aveeno shaving cream (the sensitive skin one)
1 500mg Pantothenic acid tablet

PM: Shower, sometimes I'll use the acne.org AHA+ in conjunction with BP, I find it helps with scarring and also works to even skin tone and helps treat acne more effectively  

I exercise regularly and eat relatively healthy.. maybe about 60% of the time and try to drink a lot of water as well.

So what did I do? I had had enough. I was tired of spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars on doctors appointments, and antibiotics. Nothing had worked, and if anything, my skin was getting worse. So I fired the guy. There could only be one explanation for nothing working. I came to the conclusion that most of my acne was being caused by all the stuff I was doing to my skin to prevent acne! My skin wasn't being allowed to reset itself to its natural state.

So what do I do now? Topically

I've supplemented this with....supplements. I did some reading about how keeping the colon healthy and regular helps in keeping your skin clear. Apparently

So

1. Don't touch your face. Ever.
2. Change your pillow case every few days
3. Sleep on your back if at all possible. I had to retrain how I slept and it is still difficult. Whenever I sleep on my side
4. For shaving, and while seeming like a downgrade, I am much happier with the results and the shaving experience. If you have very light facial hair like mine, shave in the shower using only water. If you have thicker facial hair, I recommend using the Gillette Series shaving cream. I'm also aware that a lot of men swear by their DE safety razors. Because of my facial hair type, this kind of razor is unnecessary for me, so I can't speak to its efficacy with acne.
5. THE ONLY THING ALLOWED TO TOUCH YOUR FACE IS WATER (with exception of shaving cream). This also includes towels. Do not use anything to dry your face. Splash water on it
6. Supplements! In the morning after breakfast, 1 probiotic pill, and 1 fish oil pill. After lunch, take 2 fiber pills. After dinner, take 2 fiber pills and 1 fish oil pill
7. drink lots and lots of water

And that's pretty much it. I've been an acne sufferer for over eight years

It is now six months later and my acne has not returned.

Note: A word of warning. For the first few days that you stop washing/moisturizing your face, most of the dead skin will be gone. Do not try to manually exfoliate it, as that can inflame the skin.

Until I went on a mostly Paleo diet. Essentially, and next to no corn or sugar. I occasionally eat dairy, usually in the form of full fat Greek yogurt.

Because of this, that diet was the main cause of acne.

About 4 weeks ago, and forehead. I decided i was done with this shit and I was gunna go on accutane after trying everything. I went to the derm and told him i was ready to try accutane (i wanted to exhaust all efforts before going on accutane, i have had some irritable bowel issues in the past so i was afraid it would cause it to flare up, but at this point it was worth it because i was so horribly depressed and miserable).

So i do the bloodtests and all the paper work and i was ready to start. I get the prescription and go to the pharmacy a few days after to pick it up. In hindsight, called 5 different pharmacies, and even asked if there was some financial aid programs. Nothing. My heart sank. So here is were the good news starts!

Since I had nothing to try left, and your pores being clogged with oil  and bacteria, but like i said, i had nothing to lose. So I stopped washing my face completely. I thought, ""what the hell do i have to lose"". 2 weeks later, my face started to clear up, and I was baffled. I showered every day, nothing, but oddly enough
 

I then had a revelation. Every teenager gets acne. That's apart of puberty. The only problem is that i over reacted. Ever since i was 13, my acne was always red and inflamed, but it was completely caused by over washing and not letting my skin do its own thing. 3 weeks later, I have some existing scars, and 1 zit on the side of my cheek, but my face is 95% clearer, and my complexion and dark marks look SO MUCH better.

So, if whatever you are doing isnt working, you have nothing to lose. This is the happiest i've been in the last few years. These last two years has been a very dark time in my life, and im so excited to start living again and having confidence. Love you guys, and I genuinely wish you the best of luck.

Come my 13th birthday, it got worse. And worse. And worse. I'm 16 now, and in the last few months it got to the point where I would sometimes have difficulty sleeping due to face pain, or my cheeks would swell up.

I've been to numerous dermatologists, you name it. The only option I haven't tried is the no-dairy diet; however I only found out about it recently, and if I did try it I would have no way of telling what is working. So the milk and cheese stays.

**The action:**
Recently I decided I'd take my chances with Accutane. I've heard the good and the bad, and I'm taking it.

I'm going to post here pictures of my progress (if any), and I figure it's better to post when there's some significant progression anyway.

Backstory I always had oily skin and acne, only then suddenly acne comes around and unlike before it was alot. So I decide to go to my GP again he decides to prescribe me tetracycline, mean while I get depressed, I am afraid to go outside and as a result dropped out of college and rarely came outside. Luckily my parents are understanding and understood that pushing me to go outside would just make me more miserable. Anyway the tetracycline made me noxious all the time and barely put a dent in the acne, so he prescribes me doxycycline and after that minocycline, all that didnt work and just made me hopeless since 4 months had passed and my life is put on hold. My GP forwarded me to a dermatologist who prescribed me accutane 40mg a day and needed to get a bloodtest done monthly and told me to read the side effects. 1 month passes by havent noticed any side effects and the size of the pimples had decreased significantly only problem the bloodtest came out a bit worry some so the dermatologist decided to reduce it to 30mg a day month two comes along the acne has dissapeared almost completely and only red scars remain and some pimples, bloodtest is good so it keeps going this way a few months pass and I am starting to get back into life I am going outside again meeting my friends etc I apply for college again everything goes great the only side effects are dry lips

Anyways

* I have been on Minocycline for about a year which has helped some but by no means was a magic cure. I think it helps

* I saw the largest improvement in my acne after I stopped touching my face. This was much harder than it sounds but the difference really showed. Every single time I would go to touch my face I would try to be conscious of it and not do it. It took months to deprogram myself from doing this but its a huge help. Now

* I no longer use any acne cleansers or scrubs or lotions. Now, acne since High school or about five years ago I have not used any cleanser or spot reducer or anything

* And finally, is what really took me over the edge.

**Day 1**: Packed all my skin products away. It's odd

**Day 2**: Skin is noticeably smoother and less redness. A few very tiny whiteheads appeared but no other signs of other major breakouts. Honestly I was afraid I would wake up with a huge breakout. 

**Day 3**: Record breaking 83 degrees in the early spring here. Had to splash my face multiple times with water due to AC not working. Skin has no signs of new breakouts. Previous whiteheads flattened. Starting to notice little amounts of dead skin building up. Skin actually feels supple? Ignoring the temptation to apply moisturizer or toner. 

**Day 4**: Three new bumps surfaced they look less irritated as they usually would

**Day 5**: Today isnt so great few tiny bumps have surfaced  I think my face is hitting the purging point in this process.  My skin still feels naturally moisturized but not overbearingly oily. Although my skin texture feels nice I'm a bit sad with the new breakouts. Still keeping my hopes up.

Sorry for delay it's the weekend.

**Day 6-7** : No new bumps or signs of breakouts. Seems like previous bumps are healing faster than they normally would before this regime .Definitely notice face is less red. Although I'm not clear I'm liking that my face isn't irritated.
 
I decided I will contine this regimen past 10 days. My face seems to enjoy that there's no products on it also seems as effective as with products except again face isn't red skin feels soft. Will post pictures very soon.
Also sorry if my posts somehow end up jumbled. I edit and make daily updates on my phone in bed right before I go to sleep. Sleepy time~

**Day 8-9**: hoo boy~ my face is itchy and dry in some spots. Been drinking lots of water. Previous bumps have come to the surface to the point that any slight pressure will definitely release them.

I've also made the effort to tie my hair back away from my face before I go to bed. I notice my face looks nicer in the morning.

**Day 10-11**: So my face is dry in the morning then starts to get oily throughout the day.

That or my face haates when I use coverup. Face is still incredibly itchy I'm guessing cause of deadskin.

**My skin:**  I had a moderate case of surface acne on my face.  By November, but also so dry that it was flaking off. 

**My (previous) regimen:**  I was washing my face in the morning with a salicylic acid soap

**The dermatologist:**  I went to a dermatologist in early November.  She said that women in their mid-20's often go through hormonal changes that cause them to develop acne.  She asked me nothing about what I'd tried, I would need to wash my face about four times a day.  

**What I actually did:**  

I thought about the evidence.  I have extremely sensitive

* I almost completely stopped washing my face with soap.  I didn't fill my prescription for the antibiotic soap, I skip the soap and just use water.  I think this bullet-point is the most important.  Agitating your skin constantly with different detergents and drying agents *causes more acne*.    

* I stopped touching my face.  No more picking

* I washed my pillowcases and towels almost every time I used them

* I started taking a multivitamin, but I wanted to get a lot of vitamin A.  At this point, I am pretty much on the [paleo diet](http://www.reddit.com/r/paleo).  I think getting my vitamins through food has definitely helped, but not as much as doing away with harsh soaps.

Day 13's photo was taken in a different room in a different apartment

From Day 6 - 11 I had my period and my face was ransacked by evil acne creating demons.  The area around my mouth broke out like what usually happens and I had 2 new zits above my right eyebrow.  Probably because I got bangs recently and have been touching them a whole bunch - ugh!

Right now I am using sunflower seed oil to cleanse at night. It's awesome at taking off my makeup and making me feel moisturized.  In the morning I cleanse with Simple brand gentle face wash to get off the oil from the night and the oil from cleansing (tends to get in the way of putting on my make up - make up won't stick as well :/ )

I'm pretty sure the breakout that I got was from my period/pms/anxiety and not the oil

Any words of advice or help at anything I'm doing wrong or right? I'm slightly leary about this whole process and I hope it works out :/

Basically I've been experimenting with my diet and different vitamins for 2 years or so and I've finally one the battle (provided it doesn't come back!) and I feel selfish for not trying to help others.

Vitamins that made a difference -

* B5 - Everyone seems to think this is some sort of miracle cure, but only .5g twice a day.

* Fish oil made a huge difference

* chromium picolinate

* Alpha Lipoic Acid and Selenium. These 2 are both free radical scavengers and anit-oxidants

* the final and most important supplment is! http://www.herbsofgold.com.au/products/product/1577
after about a month on this I didn't really get any new blemishes

Diet - I'm certain that diet is paramount when it comes to skin quality

* Diary - I've always had an allergy to whey and cassien protein

* Gluten - Turns out I have celiac disease (lol) but once I cut this out

* Citrus fruits. So many people will argue that it's impossible for fruits to have a negative effect but at one stage I was drinking loads of lemon water to treat water retention and I broke out with acne to the sides of my mouth. I did another trial and test with it

* shitty foods and caffeine. Pretty obvious


Overall it wasn't just one of these diet changes/minerals that cleared my skin but the combination of them all. I'm pretty ecstatic about my progress and I apologise for the wall of text and lack of proof reading.

I have always suffered with moderately severe acne from when I was teenager. They had subsided for some time between 21 to 23 years. But from past 1 year it started increasing and making my face look real ugly. During teenage at-least the acne scars used to fade away real quick

After doing a lot of research on net I found out that hormones play a major role in causing acne. I wanted to meet a endocrinologist but they did not seem to be found anywhere near my place, etc.

I wanted to get a second opinion. The second gynac was suggested by my mom's friend. She told me that she is the best gynac in my city. I went and met her and she just said ""Don't worry

So I started keeping a watch on what I eat and starting doing some sort sort of exercise for 30 mins everyday. I have noticed a considerable change in my face acne in just three weeks. I am left with only 1 acne pimple now

So this is what I am following:

1. Cutting down on white sugar. I am now adding small amount of brown sugar to my tea.

2. Avoiding sweets and oily food. If I do get tempted I eat a little of it like half a piece of sweet

3. Drinking lots of water.

4. Including lots of fresh vegetables and fruits in my diet.

5. Eating some mint leaves. Spearmint is supposed to lower androgen levels which may be causing acne. I am not sure if the mint found here is spearmint.Also

6. Doing some kind of exercise for 30 mins everyday. I usually go to yoga class or gym at my office but if I am not able to go
Results seen in three weeks: Lost three kgs and reducing the acne on my face from 7 to just 1.

I wanted to share my experience so that others can benefit from my findings. Also

Wash your face every morning and night with NO exceptions. This is going to be the thing that really helps. I used to wash my face only once a day because the cystic acne was so painful. All of the products that I'm using are mild and nonirritating

1. Face Wash: [Epicurean Clarify Cleanser] (http://www.amazon.com/Epicuren-Clarify-Cleanser/dp/B001R1NXOQ/ref=pd_sim_bt_6)- This wash is gentle yet strong enough to get deep in your pores to really clean your face. My skin feels soft and smooth after washing and never dry or tight. I did notice that my skin felt a little rough for the first week or so of use

2. Toner: [Cucumber Cleansing Lotion] (http://www.mariobadescu.com/cucumber-cleansing-lotion) or [Special Cucumber Lotion] (http://www.mariobadescu.com/special-cucumber-lotion) - I meant to get the special cucumber lotion

3. Acne treatment: [Buffering Lotion] (http://www.mariobadescu.com/buffering-lotion) - Again this isn't a lotion

4. Moisturizer: **Night** - [Epicuren Facial Emulsion] (http://www.amazon.com/Epicuren-Facial-Emulsion-2-oz/dp/B000ULI3Y4/ref=sr_1_3?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1321853618&amp;sr=1-3) - For many years I didn't use moisturizer because my face gets so oily, that I've started using it in the morning too. 
**Day** - [Oil Free Moisturizer] (http://www.mariobadescu.com/oil-free-moisturizer-spf-17) - USE SUNSCREEN! Will help keep skin healthy and cancer free. Even though a nice tan helps cover my acne scarring

5. Exfoliation: About 2 or 3 times  week I use an exfoliating scrub [Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Daily Scrub] (http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Oil-Free-Daily-Scrub-Ounce/dp/B000NWDSAE/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1321892233&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr0)  or a mixture of 3 parts baking soda/1 part water to help clear away dead skin. Don't do this until your acne is almost completely gone. A scrub on erupted skin will be painful and can spread bacteria and make things worse.     

Remember that it can take up to a month to start seeing results with any new acne treatment. I started seeing clearer skin after a week and by the end of the first month, are pain free!! Now I just need to find a good product to fade the acne scars.

I've always had acne.  I started getting blemishes in the fifth grade when I got my period (I am 20 years old now).  My acne has never fully gone away but it has always been tolerable.  Lets face it there are children dying of cancer; I can live with a few pimples on my face/ back.  I was always able to control breakouts with either proactive, and prescription lotions.  I absolutely love my dermatologist and has always succeeded in clearing up my breakouts.    

While I was at college this past winter I became extremely depressed.  At first I thought it may have been the hormones for my birth control making me moody so I stopped taking it.  My depression got so bad that I had to withdraw from school and come home.  Once at home I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder.  During this time I had a moderate breakout but it hardly bothered me compared to the other shit I was dealing with.  My psychiatrist prescribed me a mood stabilizer called lamictal.  

After being on this medicine for about 5 months my skin is unbearable.  I don't want to hang out with my friends or go out.  I don't want to sound over dramatic but the way I look right now is dragging me back into the black hole of depression - A place I never want to be again.  I've posted on r/bipolar asking if other women if they experienced breakouts from taking lamictal - some said yes they had breakouts but not to the extent of mine.  They also said lamictal can mess with your hormones.  Right now my breakout is contained to my jawline and neck however it is slowly spreading towards my mouth and cheeks.  I know that acne on the jawline/ neck is usually caused my hormones.  SO do you think the culprit of my breakout is the lamictal???

Currently I am back on the pill.  I've been to my dermatologist 4 times in the past 3 months.  I have another appointment in 3 weeks.  I've been on two different antibiotics.  I am taking the stronger of the two twice a day right now (I've been on it for two weeks and have seen no change).  I am using two different prescription lotions - one in the morning one at night.  I changed my shampoo to a non residue (a suggestion I saw on here)  I use aveeno clear complexion cream cleanser to wash my face.  I don't go tanning.  I don't smoke.  I wash my pillow cases weekly (not that it matters because I sleep on my back).  I make a conscious effort not to touch my face.  I eat healthy AND I am chugging water like it is my job.  

I honestly do not know what to do.  I don't know if you guys can even give me any advice since I think I covered basically everything.  SO basically I'm asking for some support.  Please give me the silver lining I need.

I've had acne for about as long as I can remember. I'm 24, below the lips, to the side of the lips. As I'm sure you're aware, it deals a pretty significant blow to my self-esteem on a daily basis.

About a year ago (June 1st, Texas. I just wanted to make a change and do something different, and, as it happens, I'm half-French and enjoy dual-nationality status. So I saved up and made the move. Now, here's where it gets strange...**two weeks** after moving to Paris, all the acne on my face disappeared. This is no hyperbole - the acne was GONE, finished. For the rest of my time in Paris, my diet, and ate meat

Unfortunately, to NYC, on February 1st. I had been talking about the move to my friends on both sides of the pond, and I started to think about my acne. What if it came back upon my return to America? What if this incredible disappearance was just something about France, and that coming back to the states would cause it to return to the surface? I wasn't so surprised to find, then, that when I moved back in February, my eating and exercise habits are better than they've ever been. I'm working out 4 to 5 days a week

Here's me in Paris

And here's my face now

What the *fuck* happened? Does anyone know what it might have been? This is a mystery to anyone I bring it up to; they say it might be the air

SO after using the gross dorm showers my freshman year (and obviously I wore shower shoes) I still got plantar warts.  Yes, prescription shit, and the duct tape thing.  After they all failed I resorted to Pinterest.  People swore by apple cider vinegar to remove plantar warts, so I tried it.  IT WORKED.  And fast too! So now that my plantar warts are gone and I still have almost a full bottle of apple cider vinegar I thought to myself ""why not this try this on my stubborn acne?""  If you haven't seen my other post on this subreddit ... I have had acne since the 4th grade (I'm 20 now) and I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING.  So I've been using the apple cider vinegar for about a week as a toner.  It smells bad so i put it on at night before bed.  Believe it or not I am seeing a HUGE difference in a week.

edit for clarification on before after pics: green shirt is before..been using for 4 days. Gray shirt pic taken today. I have makeup on in pics mainly because I have a lot of hyperpigmentation so it's hard to discern what's a spot or a pimple. Used overhead light in bathroom so you can see where the raised areas are zits.

So, but I still get these little ""patches"" of acne that I can't seem to get rid of. My skin responds really well to anything acid based...but it's hypersensitive and dries out super easily. So, although things like glycolic, azealic and salicylic acid work well for me...it leaves me with dry, flaky skin.

SO...I was at CVS the other day and I remembered when I was younger my mom used to use Kerasol all the time for her dry

Here are the active ingredients in Kerasal:

Salicylic acid 5%

Urea: 10% (Sounds gross

White petroleum

So far it's only been a couple of days but I can already tell my skin is benefiting from the acids but not drying out

Has anyone else ever tried anything like this and experienced positive results? I can't find a single thing about it on the internet.

Oh..this is my routine:
1) Wash with castor oil and a clean cloth
2) Pat dry face and rub in kerasal until absorbed
3) Moisturize with castor oil and pat dry with cloth
4) Apply pea size amount of Monistat Anti-Chafing Gel (I know

Like most people here I suspect

I bought high heat sunflower seed oil from a grocery store nearby, I have been mixing 20% or less castor oil into 75% sunflower seed oil, and 5% tea tree oil all into a shot glass(only to about 1/4 to 1/2 of the way up), and applying it liberally to the face. After washing my face with some warm water, drying it, and applying the oil, I use a hot washcloth over the face to really antagonize the pores into letting the oils seep deeper down. Of course you can always look up videos of this like the one that helped me figure it out:(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqKkinvvvoAI) 

I have only been washing with water, besides some persistant old blackheads, acne free, and it feels wonderful. I also bought some new castor oil that is cold pressed from a vitamin website based off of some of the recommendations I have read on other forums.

Contributing factors to my condition:
I would consistently touch my face and scratch the back of my head. I would press around bumps with my finger nail to coax black heads (probably weren't black heads but I'm not sure of the appropriate terminology) out

It had gotten so bad I had tiny bald spots ALL over my upper neck region. Large cyst-like bumps would grow and result in bald spots.

The fix:
I developed a habit of not touching my left cheek and after a couple months noticed an extreme difference and that inspired me to really do my best to pull out all stops (short of medication) to assist myself in having clear skin.

Steps:
Fresh towel EVERY night on my pillow.

Never touch any part of my head or neck with my palms. If there were any bumps which began to get a white head to them, I would just let it be until next time.

Regular sleep schedule. I know naturally wake up at 7:27

Extremely low carb diet and regular exercise, four apples a day, and carrots. At breakfast I'd have a bagel and eggs. I don't contribute my strict diet to my success necessarily, but I believe determination with zero cheating and zero simple sugars had excellent benefits.

MY NUMBER ONE SOURCE OF SUCCESS WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE MY BIGGEST CONTRIBUTION:

Short showers.

I was taking 20 to 45+ minute showers. I would stand there with the back of my head to scalding hot water for ten minute stretches while I thought about life. My shoulders and back of my head had the worst acne damage. 

I now take 15 minute showers MAX. I bring a watch with me to go as fast as possible. I'll take them before I have to do something to force myself to rush. I was weakening my skin by soaking for too long. I end with thirty seconds of cold water before I step out

I saw FANTASTIC results within a month

So basically, and got increasingly worse. This summer was absolutely the worst in my life (pics below). Throwaway account because it was so awful I have trouble talking about it. I don't want to bore you with backstory because I want to share how exactly I somehow managed to ""cure"" my acne 95%.

Basically

I was a social recluse all summer and it was only towards the end that it began to clear up.

Here are the factors that may or may not have contributed:

1. I quit working at a greasy

2. I made a conscious effort to stop picking my skin

3. A coworker suggested Pronexin to me. The website seems SUPER scammy

Then, afraid to try anything new because I could not handle breaking out again. Eventually, I incorporated back in a daily moisturizer (Mario Badescu Aloe Moisturizer)

Now, lots of money/products/etc wasted, this is what is working for me.

Night

1. Take off make up

2. MANUKA HONEY MASK!!! 30 min to 1hr. Active 20+. Has antibacterial, but a miracle worker.

3. Tone with 50% ACV

4. Pat on Rosehip Oil to moisturize (Only use if your acne is cleared up

5. Occasionally

In the morning, and use the Mario Badescu moisturizer.

Supplements:

Source of Life vitamins (expensive

Cod Liver Oil (experimenting with this one)

Probiotics!!! (I switch it up every two months or so because your body gets used to strains)

So far, there is still some dark marks to go. However, my skin is the type to flip at the switch and I hope to never, ever, be back at the place I was this summer.

Warning: I look terrible. 

So

I've had acne since the fifth grade. I must have been nine or ten years old when my first zit developed right smack in the middle of my nose. Fast forward ten years later

I've been to the dermatologist numerous times, as they help reduce the deep cysts that I constantly get. Though I have noticed and felt, at least one day after receiving the shots, that more cysts were developing on other parts of my face. This has happened on many occasions. :|

As for my lifestyle: I exercise regularly, drink only soy milk, have lost a healthy amount of weight as a result, and I generally have a positive outlook on life...though this is quickly becoming jaded thanks to my acne. The only reason I ever get depressed is because of new breakouts or the like. 

My current regimen:

-Two 100mg minocycline capsules every day (have been put on doxycycline and oxytetracycline in the past)

-Erythromycin Topical Solution USP

-Atralin (to help reduce the scars left from past break outs)

-Biafine to help moisturize since it's the only thing that can keep my skin from drying up too quickly. 

-I also shower with a 5% benzol peroxide facial wash that I apply twice daily. It's called ""Clean and Clear Advantage 3-in-1 exfoliating cleanser"".  

When it's all said and done, all it does it make people realize that I have to apply make up every day as a 20 year old male. Whoopee. 

I honestly had much more typed out, either. I'm just extremely upset that, after ten years, I still have to cater my mornings to making sure I can cover up my acne as best as I can. 

I want to be a physician and have hopes of going to medical school once I finish college, it just sucks to know that I probably wouldn't have a shot in the field because of how bad MY acne is. I mean, how would you feel, as a patient, if you had a Dermatologist with acne like me?

I am avoiding accutane at all costs. After oral antibiotics and topical retin-a cream

My story-

The first couple days I broke out, I also have a much less oily face (it is sometimes dry, I've been finding I need more moisturizer now). That being said my **main problem** is that I have deep red marks where acne use to be, which are concentrated along my chin and forehead. I am happy to say that these have begun to fade after only 4 days of megadosing B5 and moderate amounts of zinc per day (I am not sure which one to thank for that, but I'm fairly sure this is also thanks to the B5). 

The theory-

If anyone is curious about trying this method, and CoA's relations to acne http://www.coenzyme-a.com/acne_vulgaris.html (I do not recommend you purchase anything off that site, it is quite overpriced). I will, however, summarize: CoA (which is *very* important to the body) is involved in many reactions, which include the production of sex hormones and fatty acid metabolism. For teenagers (like myself), both male and female, it is simply that acne is more common in teenagers because hormone production is higher. A deficiency of CoA is caused by a deficiency in the things necessary to create CoA, end up causing more oils to be secreted onto your face

Should you decide to join me-

Get pantothenic acid supplements, by dad is a biologist and actually did a study on this). Take 5 of these per session roughly 3 hours apart (doesn't matter if it's with food or not), which is 2.5 grams per session. You'll want to total 10 grams per day, so just figure out a daily schedule (it doesn't have to be exactly 3 hours apart, just try not to take them closer than 2 hours otherwise your body won't absorb as much). If your acne disappears entirely, you'll want to go to a ""maintenance"" dosage of about 4-5 grams a day or less if problematic side effects occur (basically just don't take 10 grams a day for over 6 months, it should be obvious by then whether or not this will help).

IMPORTANT THINGS/SIDE EFFECTS-

Drink water. Buckets of it. Drinking water in itself is good for fighting acne, expect to lose some weight (don't expect this to be a good weight loss program though). Also, do not take B5 at the same time as a multivitamin or any other supplement you're currently taking, too many vitamins in your system can block absorption (certain vitamins also compete against each other). As vitamin B5 is a water soluble vitamin, you will not have to worry about reaching toxic amounts in your system. That being said, I still do not recommend you go over 10 grams, 12 grams max. The more you take, large amounts of B5 can be a stool softener (you'll have to poop more often). An interesting side effect is that I've had more dreams since beginning

Now, but it was probably the worst it's ever been, and people definitely started to notice when I went from having great skin to having a bunch of really bad inflamed pimples. I think it had to do with stopping the sulfa wash, because I have had no real changes in my diet but was always fine while using the wash. But I didn't want to rely on so many products anymore now that I was getting older, so I didn't bring the wash back in.

Did some research, but I decided to give it a try. And guess what? IT WORKED. After a few days of no dairy, new breakouts cut down drastically, and my skin started to clear up without any sulfa wash or anything! I made the mistake of eating a bunch of cheese/milk one day and ended up with a pretty bad breakout again, but as soon as I stopped it immediately cleared up.

I will add that I was always a bit overweight, and during that time my acne cleared up a lot, however I again gained weight, wasn't very active, and sometimes I was too lazy to wash my face. Also I have very oily skin.

recently I haven't been sleeping well and started to break out, it's similar to losing weight, you must be dedicated.

* I started working out. I run probably every other day.
* I put a cloth or towel over my pillow when sleeping.
* I started using a cleanser
* I try to watch what I eat.
* I try to sleep early

The key is to stick with it no matter what. There are days I get home in the AM, and I already see my face clearing up, and it's not as oily anymore. I'm hoping once I get all my acne to clear up, that I can deal with my acne scars. 

The reason I wrote this up was because I realized after going through so many different products, and I'd blame it on the brand I used. The most important thing is your lifestyle. I'd say about 80% has to do with how you take of your body and 20% is what you use to clean your face. I know some people actually have skin deficiencies that cause them to have bad skin, but I think the most of us on here will benefit from this.

Cow milk requires 4 stomachs to be digested.  Ever seen cheese or milk in traditional chinese food?  Nope.  Got any East asian immigrant friends or Indian friends who have bad acne?  It's cow milk!!

My allergy was cow milk.  I had friends who got tested for allergies and found out they were allergic to hard water.  If you really think about acne, not just your skin.

So before anyone goes through something drastic like Doxycycline , get tested for allergies.  You may become allergic to more things as you get older so everyone here please check.

It might not work for you because everyone's skin is different, that might be the one to work for you. For girls, I'd say to also try changing your makeup and/or shampoo.

That's me from 2009-2013. 2010 was the hardest year of my life. My first year of uni and I had one of the most severe cases of acne. In December 2009 I had what I considered the 'regular' amount of pimples. Then somewhere over the summer holidays (Australia) it kicked into overdrive. I had been using a an 'oxy' pimple cream which worked on individual pimples but cystic was beating it down. 

I tried Clinque's Three stage treatment around February which didn't appear to work (month of wasted effort). I went on proactiv in April and gave it the accepted month to take effect. After that failure I was having serious confidence issues. Breaking down etc

Up until this point I was still hearing the 'it's all part of growing up' bullshit. I went to the GP who got me on minocyclin and a surface gel. He also said it was part f growing up but agreed to refer me to a dermatologist. This was around May. I had been on minocyclin for a few weeks when that photo was taken.

I finally found a dermatologist that would see me after hours (I was wait listed at 3). He was shocked that people were telling me it was natural and got me on 40mg of Accutane and 2000mg of Erythromycin a day. Let me tell you high doses of Erythromycin is like being immune to EVERYTHING.

The doc told me to work up to 40mg so as not damage my system. I week after I reached 40mg I started having serious back problems. I suffered through it for a week because I just wanted my face to get better. The Doctor got me off Accutane until my back was returned to normal and then set me up on 30mg a day. This was the correct dose as I didn't have any more side effects.

It was a slow process but it finally declined. I was still a bit red and patchy when I turned 18 but it was obviously getting better. By December it was just pitting. Now it's a little bit of scarring and bad memories.

If you've reached the bottom of this congratulations. It's a bit longer than I was intending... All I can say is if you're ever worried

After 3 months of non-stop use day and night I saw little to none improvement. I gave up on it and just out right stopped trying to fix it for a while.

It went from the occasional 1 or 2 pimples every few days to about 6 or 7 every day, forehead and cheeks but also around my shoulders and chest.

1360210635.0,181o6s,MY ACCUTANE SKIN CARE ROUTINE!,Me0wmixxx,14,4,10,"Hey guys! I am 21/f and have been suffering with acne for 14 years. (started in 3rd grade when I began puberty) I have tried everything under the sun and my skin literally has not been completely clear in 14 years. I tried proactive a number of times, spot treatment

I finally pulled the trigger and went on accutane. Luckily

I am experiencing side effects of course but nothing serious. Thank god

I started accutane with 20mg, and just finished my 4th dose at 60mg.

Side effects I have:
-dry flaky skin on face
-very very dry skin all over
-dry hair
-I produce no oil what so ever (my face used to be a grease-slick.. I used 5 oil blotters a day!)
-rash on hands
-dry nose
-I wake up every morning with dry crusty boogers (sorry gross) that I literally can't blow or pick out without bleeding or crying.
-bloody dry flaky lips and cuts on the side of my mouth

So here is my PERFECTED skin care regime while being on accutane

Morning:
-wash with CeraVe foaming cleanser
-put on CeraVe PM facial moisturizing lotion (while my face is still fairly damp to lock the moisture in)
-Aczone for spot treatment (don't know how much it does but it makes me feels better putting it on huge red zits or cysts)
-Benefit Hello flawless oxygen WOW Foundation and apply with a foundation brush
-then a little mac studio fix powder on top just to set it.
-For my body
-cruel itch defense for dry itchy skin on problem areas. The back of my arms

Night time:
-wash face with clearasonic mia2 using CeraVe foaming cleanser
-cerave PM

All day:
-aquaphor for lips
-cvs brand hand cream
-target brand nasal moisturizing spray


I hope I helped some of you on this tough journey on accutane and if you have any questions at all please comment!!!!!!!!

Now, I thought I could slowly incorporate the sugar that I have so dearly missed back into my diet. As I should have expected, my face is now worse than it has been in months. Time to go back to the diet, I guess. 

Occasionally however

These people, exercise and burn thousands of calories just to maintain a life for oneself and one's family. Nowadays, none of us have to do any of that, so we find it very difficult to eat right and exercise often. Not to mention, these people didn't have the luxury of using the countless OTC creams, washes, and acne agents that we have today. And in some ways, but I feel that coupled with proper diet and exercise

This is just my opinion of acne's root cause. There is so much that contributes to it that it's hard to pinpoint. As a long time sufferer, when really I'm sure the answer to my problems lies in a healthier lifestyle. No dermatologist of mine has ever suggested that, and it's disappointing that a healthier lifestyle isn't the first and foremost thing prescribed.

==============for severe situations read from here========================



how bad was it? first of all i have high cheek bones, it was that bad. 

if your current situation is similar to this

accutane is a powerful drug, then you check back with your derma and depending on the results, they either give you another or lighten your dosage.

they also have a steroid that they inject on the cystic acne

once i was taken off accutane





=========for average situations and my process of eliminations here==============



by average

i know how it goes, buy products and so on. i did all of that, and they all helped out with my testing and now i'd like to share my results with you.

fisrt of all

how to make sense of that?

it's true that certain foods cause acne, then eating chips and drinking soda will cause it to flare up. if there's no source of fire, then the gasoline won't ignite anything.

so here's how i handle this.

everything is in moderation.

everything is measured.



============for diet read here===========


this is my food lifestyle. try it and see if it helps.

i always have rice in every meal, you're only cheating yourself if you decide to ignore this.

even though i said ""it doesn't mean you cannot ever eat what you want""

Solids don't eat
* fast food
* processed food (everything in a can, including instant noodles)
* fried foods (i use a grill instead of frying)
* fried fish is by far the biggest flare up trigger for me


Liquids don't drink
* soda
* energy drinks
* milk or any dairy alternatives like soy or skim

* coffee - i want to write a section dedicated to coffee as this is the reason why i'm writing this whole thing. i can't seem to sum up my thoughts on how to best summarize this. everything i've done up until this point

my daily life is like this. coffee in the morning, i'd always get new swollen spots on my face, which would later form into acne. it would stress me the fuck out, since i've been very diligent with everything. i decided, maybe it's coffee. this was my eureka moment. i drink huge mugs of coffee every morning, with sugar and cream. i have no idea why i didn't think about eliminating that sooner. this was just about 2 weeks ago or so. ever since then, i could ease up on the things i couldn't eat like chips and fried foods

i'm thinking coffee was a huge catalyst for everything i take in. this was a huge moment for me


solids can eat
i'm still healing so i still maintain a pretty strict diet plus it's also good for my personal health

* chicken or turkey meat
* vegies
* fruits
* nuts (always in moderation don't gobble down bags)
* pretty much anything as long as it's boiled, which i rarely do, i'd use olive oil.

liquids can drink
to be honest all i drink is water, it's water. i have a huge glass, and i drink a lot.


when eating, i'd eat fruits. bananas are a constant. apples, grapes, berries. if you can afford chips and sodas, you can swap those out for fruits instead.

again with the diligence and patience.



===================for hygiene and daily treatments read here====================


these are the things i do on a daily basis that i believe contribute a huge part to my healing.

* i wash my face first thing in the morning and before going to bed.

* i avoid touching my face as much as possible.

* if i have a new zit forming, it will come back twice as worse and causes to heal twice as long.

* when popping a zit, and to make sure that whatever comes out, gets soaked up rather than have it drip on my face.


* washing my face

* exfoliate

this might be a bit harsh for some people depending on your skin type

but before i use the brushes, what i do is i get a large cup that can hold these brushes in, fill it with hot water and let is sit for 5mins, so the bristles soften up and then i can use them on my face.

* moisturize, or you can use your own as long as it's non comedogenic.

* Meladerm - as for topological creams there's one product i highly recommend. it's called Meladerm. buy it from their website. use this after showering. at night before going to bed and during the day only if you're staying at home

what this does for me, it takes time to work but this speeds up the healing process compared to letting it clear up on its own without treatment.





=======cleaning up destressing a bit ocd but effective and good practice overall==========





for me, if i'm spending so much time in this one place, i might as well make it the best damn place ever. which lead to the following.

i cleaned up all my crap. dusted and mopped the whole place and for maintenance, but there's a method to my madness, and a reason to my insanity.

another brain fart that occurred to me is my bed. in our life time

number one is my pillow. if you have acne like me i'm sure you know the feeling of having blood stains on your pillow case and then those blood stains pass thru the pillow case onto the pillow itself. one solution i figured out that really helps is to use a bath towel. i have the big bath towels that i can fold in half and have a thicker padding to lay on since i bleed pretty bad when i sleep. the other good thing about using bath towels is that it can better absorb your sweat and oils on your face compared to just a pillow case.

here's what i do, then on the following night, i fold it inside out, and the final night i flip it to the back. after that, i get a new towel and repeat.

i do my laundry every week as well so everything is fresh and new which eliminates stress of dirty laundry piling up.

try to get a minimum of 8 hours of sleep. it takes about an hour to get yourself to fall asleep so best to make it 9

* **Cut out dairy**, just cut it out. Replace it with almond milk. 
* **Get a retin-a-micro prescription**. I say micro specifically because it's usually in a gel form and the medicine time-releases which means it works on your skin
* **Sunscreen**
* **Neither too hot nor too cold water**
* **Less is more.** I use retin-a-micro, put on the sunscreen, and when I come home I take it off with salicylic acid wash (neutrogena acne cleanser) and either put on a moisturizer or just put on my retin-a-micro (I'm a homebody so I don't always go out after work). With cystic acne, your skin's strength is really important as it can help to resist breakouts. Doing too much to it just erodes your skin's natural barrier and resiliency. 
* **Diet is really important for cystic acne.** Eat well, blueberries, and cherries every day. 
* **Make note of any medications you might be taking**
* **Do NOT take biotin or eat too many foods with biotin.** I learned this the hard way. I went on a chia seed kick because it's so good for you (yes I read Born to Run)
* **EXERCISE.** Can't stress this enough for cystic acne. Exercise increases your body's production of antioxidants like glutathione and regulates your body. Notice how most athletes simply don't have acne. Especially do cardio (running, just make sure you sweat), and some weight lifting.   
* **If you're a dude, shave down always. I use a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power which tends to get close enough to be professional without shaving against the grain. Steam opens up pores and softens hair so try and take a long shower before you shave. Then use a cleanser on your face because dirt and grime collected in your pores can make shaving more tough and cause irritation. Then use a badger brush and a true shaving cream. Put some cream in a normal kitchen mug that you don't use, lather up the badger brush by moving it around in the mug, then apply the brush to your face with small circular movements until you get a good lather, do this for 5 minutes. Then finally go ahead and shave. 
* I've heard some people have reduced or eliminated gluten in their diet. I haven't so I don't know but it couldn't hurt I suppose.

I've gone through everything and anything in my middle/high/college days to fix my acne. I've tried every antibiotic, diets, crazy tips, and anything I thought would help. At the end of the day all it took was.....honey. Plain and simple. 
Every day for 20-30 minutes I would do a honey facemask and I haven't had a breakout in 3 weeks! I have not seen my face this clear since 7th grade. Also drink plenty of water (I do a gallon a day).

Heres my routine:

* Wash face with luke warm water
* Honey mask for 20-30 min (or longer if you have time or just hanging out at home)
* Wash with cold water
* Moisturize (coconut oil works for me)
* I pat my face down with a dry towel right after the coconut oil

I highly recommend at least trying this

I'm still a little hesitant to get off of the antibiotics (which helped stop only about 50% of acne) but I'll skip a couple days and see how that works out.

1358747214.0,16z36w,How I keep my moderate acne under control.,gearheaven,14,7,3,"Hello! :) This is my first post

I'll try to keep my story somewhat short. Please bear with me as I'm typing this from my pain-in-the-ass phone.

I just turned 24 and I've been dealing with acne since the 4th grade. Both my parents had acne (my mom had it especially bad) so I got hit hard with breakouts. I also had a very poor diet as a child, which worked well for a while. It stopped working for me eventually, which seems to be the case for many proactiv users. I tried practically every over the counter acne treatments with little success. There was one year, however, that I recall being very clear from using a straight up benzoyl peroxide cream. For whatever reason, I stopped using benzoyl peroxide because I thought my skin would be better off if I used products that were 'all natural'. Bad mistake, my skin ended up breaking out in severe acne. It quickly got infected to the point where it looked like I had impentigo covering my entire face. Luckily, prednisone

The results I got from accutane were unfortunately short-lived and I eventually started breaking out again (I believe after about 6 months post-accutane) This seems to be the case for. a lot of females who take accutane

I do still suffer from moderate acne, life.

Treatments I've tried but gave up on:
- Salicylic acid topicals (2%) unfortunately do nothing for me.
- Honey masks
- Aspirin masks
- Using just water on the skin
- Using natural soaps and moisturizers (made it soooo much worse!)
- Antibiotics (didn't want to become resistant)
- Proactiv
- Differin (this I most recently stopped using. It worked well for a while but eventually lost its effectiveness.)
- Taking tons of supplements that supposedly help acne (my room looked like a damn GNC store but in the end
- Hormonal contraceptives (tried many- all made my skin so much worse
- Accutane

What I do now is pretty simple. I'm back to using benzoyl peroxide on a twice a day basis. I pretty much follow the ""acne.org regimen"" but with a twist.

Products: 
- Purpose cleanser (my absolute favorite!) I use this once a day.

- Vivite glycare cleanser. This contains 10% glycolic acid

- Paula's Choice Clear treatment gel

- Vivite replenishing cream. This is hands down the best moisturizer I've ever used. Its oil free, its worth it I suppose. 

- Olay complete for sensative skin w/SPF 15.

- Sometimes I'll spot treat with 10% sulfur ointment. I forgot the name

- Once a month

MAKEUP:
- First off, dead skin cells, and bacteria underneath.

- I use mineral makeup only. I stay away from bare minerals since its loaded with bismuth oxychloride (not the matte version

MISC:
- I'll give myself a microdermabrasion treatment once in a while to help with blackheads and to smooth out my skin.

- Any time I get a pustule (what many call a ""whitehead""), extract. Doing so prevents the spread of inflammation and the pustule heals quite quickly. The proper way to extract is by first steaming the skin (I extract after a steamy shower, though I try not to let the hot water come in contact with my face too much). Then I use a lancet horizontal to my face to make a slight opening at the VERY TOP of the pustule. From there, I stretch back the skin, push slightly down on the skin, and then push gently towards the pustule to release the gunk within. Then I disinfect. I hope this makes sense!


What I should be doing to achieve even clearer skin:

- Drink more water.  I can't get in the habit

- Drink spearmint tea. This is suppose to lower androgens

- Change my pillow case every other night. I really don't know why I haven't been doing this.

- Cut back on carbs and sugar. Sugar is easy for me to cut back on but I love me some bread. :( I also would like to take a couple supplements that help keep blood sugar levels normal. A couple examples include chromium

- Get more sleep. I should be sleeping now

- I could probably stand to use more exercise and less Netflix/video games. I blame this on my boyfriend.

Anyways, lots of scarring. My scarring isn't as bad as it used to be. IPL and pixel laser treatments have helped a lot.

I've shaved my head. Like with no guard trimmer (see [pic](http://www.men-hairstyle.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/butch-haircut.jpg)). Noticing a slight improvement. Probably because the oils from my hair dont contaminate my skin when I cant wash my face.

I have facial wipes which I use when I don't have time to wash face. 

My current daily routine:

** Morning (before work): **

Have warm shower
- get out shower and apply Cetaphil Oily Skin Cleanser (face
- Rinse in shower
- Pat dry
Go to room

** During day **
Go to work and sweat. When rush ends; rinse face with water/change shirts.

** During night **

Go have a shower (repeat morning method)
GO to bed.

I haven't noticed any dry skin yet. 

Shaving.

I recently got gifted a Gillette Sensitive Skin pack

I seem to notice my face getting inflamed (razor burn?) the next morning. I know about shaving hair not skin routine

So shaving routine involves:

Get out shower
Apply gel to face
Shave
Apply [Natio after shave balm](http://natio.com.au/men-shaving/calming-aftershave-balm#)

When I wake up my face feels oily and my pores feel open.

Any tips and experiments I can partake what's causing my acne? Pretty sure it's not hormonal any more.

I walk 2.4 miles to school every other day and I always walk home (which is uphill 60% of the way). I live a healthy life style....and I don't pick at my face (even though it feels like I'm on fire 90% of the time). Yet my acne has still persisted...""to hell"" and it ain't getting better.

My goal is to try the caveman-regimen (which I've never heard of till now), My acne changes daily, for the worse and better. It is calm in the morning, but by the end of the day, it's like ""f^&amp;%* that!"" and it turns s*%ty again. So wish me luck, once again, I'm trying the caveman regimen and I'll be updating each afternoon so that you guys can see any improvement. If I do by miraculous chance see an improvement I'll be doing everything I can to make the regimen better known. I should probably mention in a side note that I am not overweight and actually fairly fit (just in case ppl think that might be a factor).

So to summarize my daily regimen will include the following:

Not touching my face or splashing water on it (taking baths to wash my hair not getting my face wet)
Eating healthy as normal (lots of fruits veggies
Going to bed by 9:30 max/night.
Surviving (hopefully).
Daily 2.4 mile walk/exercise

I've been noticing something weird with my acne over the years. It began when I was 12/13. I remember my mom bought me something from Avon, this is the end to my problems!

But I just kept getting pimples.

A couple years later I got my first cyst. (At this point I was doing my best to pop all my pimples, but it just wouldn't come to a head.

Then one night while on the phone I'm squeezing it, and my fingers were covered in a slimy pink goop. Oh god it was gross. At the same time it was so interesting that **that** came out of my face. I drained it, but then it filled with blood and part of my face was black for a week.

Fast forward a few years

Since then it seems to be a vicious cycle. Wash face, worse pimples. I tried various methods of birth control. It would help for a bit then I'd get cysts a few months after starting it. And oh god do I hate the cysts. Painful, red bumps. If they pop they just fill with blood. Some don't drain completely so they heal and you've got lumps under the skin. Ick.

I've tried so many different cleansers, moisturizers. I never got on Accutane, even though my mom got it for my younger brother. I've fantasized about affording microdermabrasion and chemical peels, even once in a dark time wanting to scrub my skin off with sandpaper. :( 

The last thing I'd bought was an Aveeno facial bar. I was sure it was going to work, blah blah blah. Well, it didn't. And I was at a loss. I'm 22 now and I don't want acne anymore! 10 years of it is very tiring.

Then I saw a post on here about oil cleansing. Totally makes sense. Using soap and water on your face just washes off the bad stuff and the oil, best analogy I can come up with).

I have very oily skin and huge pores. I heard mixed reviews about what oil would be best for that combination. I decided to go with olive oil, dry washcloth. My face feels so much better afterward, doesn't get oily so fast, and the pimples have almost totally disappeared.

I didn't use it for about 2 weeks due to stressors messing up my life, I think. I'm trying not to mess with them so much.

I just wanted to write this to let you guys know of my semi-success and give you a new option to try if you haven't already. Good luck!

I am not sure what's the deal with my pimples/acne.

I don't get blackheads, bumps on my skin. Sometimes they have a proper head, sometimes they don't.

The only treatment I use is a Clearasil pimple cream, only putting a bit on it, then flatten the cream on it. I then may leave it on for a couple of hours and sometimes overnight.

This sometimes and sometimes not can remove the pimple

The bad thing is, its a trade-off, usually. Either have no pimples and red dry skin, or pimples and normal skin. To soothe the dry skin, I try to use Moisturizing fluids (SPF15) and other times natural creams such as paw-paw. These make my skin feel better, but I don't think they help much.

I don't use shower wash's because in my past experience they've made the pimples more red and my face dry (I've tried a couple).

I should note that I eliminated 99% of my acne from this, and I've only had the occasional zit since, usually due to something I ate (dairy or so on).  Now, I'm here to report on the tea tree oil regimen I mentioned I'd try in that post.

Regimen Morning:

* Shower with warm water, turn the water cold for about 30 seconds (probably doesn't do much for acne, but it's a good way to wake up)

* Shave

* Mix two pumps of acne.org moisturizer with 4-6 drops of pure tea tree oil.  Currently I'm using Life brand

At night:

* Mix the moisturizer and tea tree oil as described above and apply the same way.

Note, this is bad because the skin reacts by overproducing oil to compensate for the dry conditions.  Some great shaving soap I recommend is [Barrister and Mann's](http://www.barristerandmann.com/) line, as the ingredients are readily available and prominently displayed on their website, and aren't harsh at all.  But there are a lot of other soaps that are also very good.  No matter which way you shave, this will benefit you (/r/wicked_edge has a ton more helpful information and is a great community).

So all in all, provided they are oil based, as I don't think a water based moisturizer would mix well with the tea tree oil (please correct me if I am wrong).

In keeping with this regimen, but I'm not sure if it's been beneficial or not.  My diet is the same as it was with the BP regimen, I should note, with the same supplements too.  I am experimenting with removing the zinc supplement.

So please, I'll post a picture as proof.",,False,,t5_2qse3,1376359000.0,,

Normally, moisturize, in that order, twice daily.  Also take 2 fish oil capsules a day.  I found that in doing this, initially, I got good results, but even with a heavy duty moisturizer I was still getting dry skin, so I decided to test it by changing my cleanser. (previously using a Swiss-Tec overpriced cleanser that I would not recommend).  I switched to (what I still recommend) Spectro Jel for sensitive skin.  Cheap cleanser, but still some dry skin and a bit of acne.

I was feeling brave, with a multivitamin (Centrum).  I was amazed.  Within a week, my dry skin problem was completely gone, and so was the residual acne.  I actually had no pimples at all for a 2 week period.  I began to cut back on the BP a bit, using it only once a day, and I still remained clear.  After doing this for a few weeks, I noticed I started to get acne again a bit (probably due to my diet change)

With the great success from this, but I'm planning on buying more acne.org moisturizer and buying some pure tea tree oil to mix in with it, and using that.  I've yet to conclude any results from this, as it's still a relatively recent.  My hope is that I can cut BP out completely and have a simple one-step regimen every morning and evening, and use my cleanser after intense physical activity to clear dirt out (but not on a daily basis like before).

I should note I've been doing working on my acne problem for a long time

1) Proactiv solution (was just 5% BP and salicylic acid apparently) (2005-2008)

2) 10% Benzoyl Peroxide

3) Swiss-tec cleanser, antibiotics (2010-2011) (I know, harsh)

4) 5% BP

5) Acne.org regimen with Swiss-Tec cleanser (2012)

6) Acne.org regimen with spectro-jel

7) Witch hazel and thyme (beginning of 2013)

8

A bunch of little stuff in between with face masks, and so on.  No ""natural"" remedies have been effective for me yet.  I did try tea tree oil briefly in 2012 to moderate success, but I also had cystic acne back then too, so that may have skewed things.  I haven't gotten a cyst in a while under this current regimen.  I'm hoping tea tree oil will be sufficient.

I've suffered from moderate to severe severe cystic acne (Back, Pilondial, Pelvic) since I was about 16. I took Accutane my senior of high school and as you can imagine it wreaked havoc on my skin and my emotions. 

However

My dermatologist (surprisingly) was the one to recommend I try another treatment of Accutane (now called Roaccutane), being afraid to take my shirt off in front of anyone, drinking heavily and taking aspirin everyday to numb the pain (yes I know that last part needs to stop immediately, please spare me the speeches). 

For the record I have tried being very healthy and conscious of my skin. For a solid year I ate very clean, made sure to get outside once in a while but always wore sun screen (oil free), I used oil free moisturizers after showers, patted my skin dry instead of rubbing it, didn't drink or smoke at all and tried dozens of different oral and topical antibiotics... nothing has worked the way that Accutane worked. Yes being healthier made a slight difference, and when I say I mean sliiiight. Eventually I had them pop back up anyway, that was last year

tl;dr version...

I'm going to lose my health insurance next year and simply won't be able to afford being on my own plan. 

My questions are: 

How many of you have had success with a second round of Accutane? 

Would you recommend that I go for it before I'm taken off my Mom's health insurance plan? 

How intense was the second round compared to the first (peeling

And lastly

I hope this wasn't too long and drawn out. As many of you can understand cystic acne is a battle and can effect people on a deep emotional level. Sometimes I want to cry when I see how bad people's acne is because I feel there pain. I saw one of the success stories on this board from a guy who had it really bad all over his face and posted a before and after picture. He said Roaccutane was his miracle drug

I have tried to work out what environmental conditions are different between the two places. In England I live in a more draughty and cooler house, too.

Another way to reduce inflammation is to take anti-inflammatory drugs such as Advil or Aspirin. However

I recently went through a horrible bout of it - I've got a couple other posts on here - and thought I would share my improvements and the changes I've made.

#1) I've completely stopped popping/poking/pestering pimples.  Unless there is a substantial white-head that is ready to explode on its own, but after not touching it once, it's not nearly as large or long-lasting as the others were.  Just don't touch your facial area in general during the day - I think this is the biggest factor in my complexion.

#2) Every other day, I apply the AcneFree Therapeutic Sulfur Mask.  You rub it in for about 30 seconds or a minute and then leave it on for 10 or 15 minutes.  Sometimes if I'm busy at my computer I'll leave it on for 45.  It comes in a 1.7oz container, so it looks really small, but I promise if you follow the instructions and use like a dime sized amount, it will last you a long time.  I've been using it for 2 or 3 weeks and it is way over half-full, still.  It is around $8.00 I think?  Anyway, my skin feels really good after it

#3) Every morning and night I use Clean&amp;Clear dual action moisturizer with Salicylic Acid in it on my face

#4) I have drastically cut down on the amount of soda I drink

#5) The last thing I am going to put up here is that I've definitely cut back on a lot of stress in my life in the last few weeks.  I'm in an infinitely better living situation, I was constantly on edge, stressed about everything, and just generally unhappy.  I've heard stress is an acne-factor, so maybe this helps too.

In general, you're touching your face, you're over-washing your face, you're poking pimples, and making everything worse for yourself.  I am also a firm believer that not one thing will 'fix' your acne, and it will not go away overnight.  Mine did go away pretty quickly, but it was still 2 or 3 weeks.  Here's hoping it stays away, I've got more important things to worry about :)  ",t5_2qse3,True

About 4 months ago, I ordered my cleanser, and what do you know, it's stolen right off of my front porch. I didn't think it was a big deal, since I was planning on seeing if my face could stay clear without any of the BP treatment.

So for the next month, and eventually I was breaking out constantly. I decided to go back to what worked before: the acne.org regimen.

I started off slowly with the BP, and my skin has been getting progressively worse for the past two months. I'm on my 9th week now, and my skin looks worse than before I started the regimen! It is incredibly frustrating, and I need some support and guidance.

I went home

For the next six months I continued to have severe panic attacks associated with psychotic imagery. I took a full year off of school. I lost my vision for about four months before having it come back. My mom had to take a leave of absence from work to be with me. 

Two years later, I now have full-blown OCD. I was a wonderfully happy, bright young person with tons of potential before Accutane. Now, I am so different. I wish for the person I was. I break down regularly because I know my life has been forever changed, because of this drug. 

And guess what? The acne came back. I have it just as bad as I did before

Trust me, but guess what? It happens to about 10% of people, and that's just psychotic symptoms, that's not even including Chrone's disease or depression. 

It's very, I was still so afraid of bugs that even typing a bug's name would set me back weeks. So, here it is. Trust me, trading your life for a temporarily clear face isn't worth it.

Background: I'm a 27 year old male and I've had acne for about 2-3 years. I've tried benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid to no avail. I can recall off the top of my head trying proactive

Treatment:

- [DHC Cleansing Oil](http://www.dhccare.com/DHC/ProductDetail.aspx?ProductID=300)

- [Tea Tree Oil](http://www.amazon.com/Desert-Essence-100%25-Australian-Tree/dp/B000UJHRKM/ref=sr_1_12?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365019423&amp;sr=1-12&amp;keywords=tea+tree+oil)

Procedure: The first thing you need to do is cut the tea tree oil since it is pretty strong on its own. I mix it with water in a 10:1 ratio (water to oil) and put it in a dropper bottle. You'll notice the water and oil won't mix so you will have to shake it up before you use it. 

1. Take the DHC oil and put a little pool in your hand (1-2 pumps from the container). 

2. Take the dropper of tea tree oil/water mix and put 3 drops into the pool of oil. Rub it between your hands to mix it up and apply it to your face. 

3. After rinsing thoroughly

4. After rinsing thoroughly again

Every winter my skin goes into ultra horrible mode though.  Usually it's just very dry and can be kept at least not too painful with lots of moisturizers.   A few patches here and there which moisturizer doesn't even help are normal

Last winter though something changed.

I started getting very bad acne (maybe acne?)  on my back, and here we are with winter starting again and it's horrible still.   The acne seems to be much larger bumps, and come almost in clusters in certain sections like my shoulder blades, the middle of my back and my shoulders, with smaller bumps all over.

I know it's not a hygiene issue because since I can't even stand skipping a day showering and am a bit of a germaphobe.  My hands suffer the most from my germaphobia though since I wash them way too often drying them out.

I don't know what to do.   I've tried a wide variety of moisturizers, hot showers, topical cream on the acne and about everything else I read that might help.   I take vitamins every day, drink lots of water, exercise 6 times a week and am fairly fit.     

I even tried sun lamps hoping that getting some ""sun"" might help!   Only thing that did was tan my arms

Nothing has helped so far.     I'm reluctant to see a dermatologist because I'm so embarrassed by how it looks

Is this even acne or does it look like something else?    Any one have any suggestion on what else I could try?    I'm desperate and out of ideas...

Here is a picture of one of my shoulder blades.    This is just a small patch of it.  It looks much worse if you could see my entire back and shoulders.

Let me describe my situation. I am nearly 21 years old and have been going to the dermatologist for acne since I was about 14. I had kind of under control through the use of antibiotic pills and creams, he okayed my request and I've been using the same antibiotic pills and creams I always have.

It seemed to help, but yesterday it flared up and is back at a nodular stage. That's the big one on top of the rest of my face and the back of my neck. I just can't take it anymore! I can't handle anymore disappointments. I'm slowly going crazy and on the verge of completely losing it! I can't stand to look in the mirror because I HATE who I see. 

Making matters worse is I have a gf now (who I asked out when my face looked half way decent) and I just feel the pressures of that on me. How can she love me and be proud of me when I look like this? It gets so so so hard on me. Even more is I'm a university student and when I sit in these auditorium classrooms with like 150 others

So I must ask the question. At this stage with where I've been and how I'm feeling, but I don't think I have a choice anymore... I'm starting to cry as I type this. I don't know what to do anymore. And from what I hear, going on Accutane is a humiliating process in itself. It's bad enough to have to use it, but going in for monthly blood tests sounds nuts. Does anybody know what they are checking for with the tests?

Does anybody else have experience with it? Another thing too is I am still with my mom for health insurance so I need to win her over and try to convince her of the med's safety. If I was on my own

Aloe Vera - Buy one of these plants


Oatmeal - Use this as a mask or a cleanser. Just grind up the oats and add a little water to it. When you saturate the oats in your hand with water

If you don't grind them 




Lemon - Great for giving your skin elasticity

After cleansing, and rinse it off. The disadvantage of this is that it can sting or burn to some people, but you get used to it after a bit.

If the lemon juice is too much to handle

Drink lemon juice straight up (with a straw so it doesnt come in contact with your teeth) or maybe just add some lemon juice to water. Helps



Green Tea - High in antioxidants


Tea Tree Oil! - This is a natural antiseptic but don't use the body shop brand as it is very uneffective compared to the other more concentrated brands. Make sure you buy this undiluted



Lemon Sugar Face Scrub - Cleanse face, put lemon juice on a cotton pad, massage gently over your face for a gentle exfoliation. Sugar is a little better for exfoliation is because most of the granules are round. 



Honey - Great natural mild antiseptic! Rub 2-3 teaspoons on your face and leave on for 5 minutes to let the sweet substance do it's stuff. Rinse off. 



Apple Cider Vinegar - Best to use natural and organic for this (as well as all the other listed remedies) Use it as a toner at full strength without diluting if you can. 



Get a cup of water



Try to acquire these ingredients that are from an organic brand. It may work better.

If you have oily skin and suffer from acne, cause infections. The solution is to exfoliate, exfoliate, exfoliate! You want to speed up cell turnover on your face. Here's how to do it, really cheap.

1. Use a St. Ives or generic peach apricot scrub as a cleanser

2. Now that the dead skin cells are gone, which is tea tree oil. This is very cheap: http://www.amazon.com/Now-Foods-Tea-Tree-liquid/dp/B000ELP5KA/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341902616&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=tea+tree+oil What you want to do is mix 1 part tea tree oil with 6 parts water. Put the mixture in a container or something. After you wash your face with the scrub, grab a clean cotton ball and spread the tea tree oil mixture over your face. Let it dry. The tea tree oil kills bacteria and controls your skins oil production!

3. Moisturize. Always moisturize. Moisturizing will help control the oil production on your face. In the morning use an SPF 15 sunscreen such as this one or its generic brand: http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Oil-Free-Moisture-SPF-Ounce/dp/B000052YP1/ref=sr_1_1?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341902998&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=neutrogena+spf+15 Be generous. The ingredients in sunscreen not only protect your skin, such as this one: http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Clear-Oil-Free-Moisturizer-4-Ounce/dp/B000052YJM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341903155&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=clean+and+clear+moisturizer Salicylic acid is great at night because it will continue to speed cell production.

4. Never, one touch, even from scratching, can spread bacteria to your face and it will seep into your pore and cause a breakout! Don't wipe your face with your hand, and don't even scratch your face. If you must touch your face, wash your hands first, or use a kleenex/paper towel as a barrier. It sounds a little extreme

So there you have it! With those 4 products, I don't even purchase my expensive prescriptions anymore!

Where to find:
Peach apricot scrub at any Walgreens or Target.
Tea tree oil at any Whole Foods or Trader Joes. Check the organic section of your supermarket. Or just order it online.
SPF 15 moisturizer at any Walgreens or Target.
Salicylic acid moisturizer at any Walgreens or Target.

I finally sucked up my, yea? So my cheeks were covered with whiteheads instead. But then, my skin was clearer than ever, perhaps with maybe a few whiteheads left on my chin. How miraculous! I stopped taking the medication, yea- stupid, because I was just happy with what I had. 
I think taking the full course would have cleared all of it
**tl;dr- took doxy + zania after 6 years of cysts- cysts went away

It's really not that bad, which I find strange- it is always on my chin on the far left, under and to the side of my mouth, and tapers off to my left cheek, but never on or over the cheekbone. Anyone know what that might mean, if anything? Cos it doesn't go anywhere else, really.

My daily routine goes something like this:
*wash face with warm and cold water in the morning
*wash face with Neutrogena acne wash in the evening (because I am probably wearing makeup)
*mostly vegan diet (started three weeks ago)- the only animal product I eat are fish and honey
*exercise every day; wash afterwards 

What should I do? See the dermatologist again? Or do you guys have some fancy tricks that worked for you?

Prior to that nothing worked except for Accutane. Accutane is pretty harsh

My severity: I'd say pretty bad

Yeah the only thing that has ever helped was switching to gluten-free low carb diet. And when I say low carb I mean low carb. Less than 20g a day (besides fiber) is ideal. It's the only thing I've ever been able to do about it besides Accutane.

Here's some science. Do you all know WHY Accutane works? Accutane limits sebum production by the liver. Sebum is your skin oil that you always hear about. Lower sebum = lower skin oil = no acne. That's why if you've ever taken Accutane you know how your face feels? Or if you pick or squeeze at something it bleeds way easier? Or how your skin on your nose is all weird and rough? That's why

Carbohydrates and blood sugar levels: The key too all of this is the glycemic index. If you don't know what the glycemic index is then you need to google or wikipedia it but briefly; the rate at which food items effect blood sugar levels, which 'burns quicker' or effects blood sugar levels more rapidly than even straight glucose - its rating is 103. Pork is 0 and on it goes. Grain based carbs and flours are all in the 80+  range iirc.

Interesting tid-bit: 5 tablespoons of table sugar will spike your blood sugar levels less than 2 pieces of organic whole-grain bread - and the gluten free flours are even worse. I think Tapioca starch is a 93 or something like that. A Mars bar will effect your blood sugar less than 2 slices of the same multi-whole-grain bread - in terms of the spike in your blood (over the same time interval)

So what? Well

Now, but what does it do with the left over and rest of the insulin?

The liver converts extra insulin into sebum ( I think among other things too). That's the kicker. It converts it to sebum! So you're spiking your skin oil levels all the time if you think about it. If you can regulate your blood sugar levels with your diet you are regulating your skin oil levels. And it works! At lest

One provision is milk. I'm not quite as clear on the science of why milk effects insulin and sebum but it has to do something with... milk contains something called insulin-like growth factor (or something like that) and your body handles that stuff similar to glucose - with an insulin spike to convert to fat. I know if I go too hard on the milk, and will last 2-3 days after that depending on my discipline during that time window). The milk issue may also be related to lactose, which is essentially milk sugar. Either way, cows milk and products effect insulin levels - I'm not sure about other milks like goat or whatever. You can look them up on the glycemic index. Interestingly, butter is low on the glycemic index so just the fat itself is okay in that regard I guess. I personally think I have to take it easy with cheese, in terms of my skin, but I haven't seen a direct ""I ate too much cheese and now 2 days later I have flare ups"" incident yet. I have seen that with heavy cream and 2 separate ""fk it

1) Honey (cinnamon) mask. This is specially great if your acne is mostly a bacterial problem. Although my acne is mainly a hormonal issue, and I've noticed it's helped with white heads too. Although most people will leave it on for 20-30 minutes in the morning and at night, I will admit that I have left the honey mask on for a few hours on my face. If you're not allergic to it and you can handle the stickyness (and the mess that may come with it) I'd recommend it. This is great for people with sensitive skin too, though the cinnamon might cause irritation, so be careful.

2) Aloe vera. I bought a bottled (natural) one but I've heard great things about people who use it straight from the plant as well. Now this tip is for the patient ones. Aloe vera gel DOES help with acne scars

3) Overnight mask. I've tried leaving on the honey mask overnight but found it to be extremely messy. So what I do now is mix the honey with aloe vera gel. The gel makes the honey way less sticky and it's worked really well for me as an overnight facial. I have added cinnamon as spot treatment in this and when I wake up the inflammation is significantly reduced. 

4) Before applying the honey mask, though), I've seen more progress in my treatment. 

5) SUPPLEMENTS!! I cannot stress how important this is and how much it helps with skin problems. I'm currently taking a multivitamins pill (with Zinc - which is extremely helpful with acne), and vitamin D separately. This is all essential, even for those without acne prone skin - since we usually don't intake as much of these nutrients in regular food as we should.

6) WATER! WATER! WATER! I can't tell you how many times I've read about the importance of drinking 8 cups of day but failed to follow it. Ever since I've gotten more strict about my acne regiment

7) Changed my diet. I cut sugar out completely. This is really hard, sugary drinks (I've traded juices for water at lunch and dinner, though you don't have to if your juice is all natural), only eat whole wheat bread/pasta/rice/etc, less dairy intake (this has been linked to acne flare ups, so I would suggest you cut it from your diet and see how your skin reacts to it), no junk foods obviously (including fried things). Be mindful of salty foods too. 
Remember: 
Refined carbs/sugar = more insulin = more hormones = more sebum (oil) = more bacteria = more acne.

8) Birth control. I'm still in my third month of the pill, which has been praised for helping women whose acne is related to hormonal issues. I'm starting to notice a slight improvement, so I'm sticking to it. 

EDIT: My dermatologist will be putting me on oral antibiotics next month. A friend of mine is also on it

1360566747.0,18aq2y,I need help.,ijustwanttoburyit__,9,4,16,"My acne started when I was in fifth grade. Now here I am as a senior
I avoid dairy
I take a multivitamin every day (2500 IU of Vitamin A; 120mg of vitamin C; 800 IU of vitamin D; 30 IU of vitamin E; 25mcg of vitamin K; 2.3mg of vitamin B1; 2.6mg of vitamin B2; 30mg of niacin
I also take an additional 50mg of zinc, and 800 IU of vitamin D on top of that.    
In the morning, I will either wash my face with soap (it's that Grandma's acne bar thing) or do a honey mask. At night, if my face isn't already clean, I'll wash it. Afterwards, I use AcneFree's sensitive skin toner and the benzoyl peroxide cream.    
Once a week
I generally eat a somewhat healthy diet. I get a decent amount of physical activity.     
I'm taking better care of my skin that ever, blackheads, you name it. I literally have over a hundred dark red scars, and every day I get more.    
It's literally to the point that as soon as I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror
My parents won't take me to a dermatologist
I have no idea what to do

Here's my routine:

Accutane:

30mg pill/twice day

Shower:

Dove soap w/moisturizing (for face)

Before sleep:

Wash face (just water)

Apply Mary Kay night cream (all over face)

Chapstick 

Sleep:

Towel on pillow

Any things that I'm using that could be bad for my skin? Most of them are pretty simple, 3rd and 4th, and so on are supposed to go, not really worried.

With that said

No real bad habits on my part when it comes to my acne, my Doctor said I should see results a bit earlier on my face because my acne wasn't that bad to start with.

I do have a few questions however, bad idea? What about non-alcoholic drinks? I take a regular protein shake that has creatine in it, no problems thus far. Also I'm a little more worried about the dark spots/scares on my face from my old acne more than any of my new acne. Anything I could start rubbing on my face to make them less obvious? They aren't bad I'm just worried when all my acne is gone it will be easier to see them so I figured why not start getting rid of them now.

Hot showers bad for dry skin

You may be apprehensive about it, because thats a shit ton of ingredients going on your face every day. For those of you with sensitive skin like me, don't even worry.

I started experimenting with zinc and other dietary supplements about two years ago

I read a lot in this subreddit, so all products I linked below are from german drugstores and pharmarcies, but I think it won't be to hard to find corresponding products in other countries.

**Supplements I Use:**

* [silicia (350mg)  + zinc (5mg)](http://www.dm.de/cms/servlet/segment/de_homepage/dasgesundeplus_home/dgp_produkte/dgp_produkte_pharma/dgp_produkte_pharma_schoenheit/36756/kieselerde-zink-kapseln.html) 3x2 per day
* [fish oil](http://www.dm.de/cms/servlet/segment/de_homepage/dasgesundeplus_home/dgp_produkte/dgp_produkte_pharma/dgp_produkte_pharma_herz_kreislauf_cholesterin/36576/dgp-omega-3-kapseln.html) 2x1 per day
* [zinc (25mg)](http://www.shop-apotheke.com/arzneimittel/6890727/zinkorot-25-tabletten.htm?expa=gob.csv_6890727&amp;campaign=googleBase/gob/Zinkorot%2025%20Tabletten%20%28100%20St%29-6890727) 2x1 per day

The first two supplements are from a drugstore (dm) and not very expensive. I tried to replace them with more expensive products from a pharmarcy some month ago

I buy the zinc capsules (third one) at an online pharmarcy. 

You see

**Other things I do:**

* wash my face every morning and evening with [oil-free cleanser](http://www.dm.de/cms/servlet/segment/de_homepage/presse/pressemitteilungen/187524/rb-balea-soft-clear.html)
* use a [facial tonic](http://www.benevi.com/de/produkte/benevi-hydroderm/obj-32-125.html) after shaving
* change my pillowcase twice a week
* don't eat much sweets
* eat a lot of fruits (homemade smoothies are one my favourites: just take a banana
* try not to touch my face if it isn't necessary

I do all these things since five month now, too. This would make me even happier ;)

About 3-4 months ago I started a new routine.  I didn't want to post earlier because I was wondering if it was the typical 2-3 week success story that always happens right after starting a new routine

In the morning I use an Apricot Scrub followed by Neutrogena's oil-free acne wash.  Then, only 4-5 days a week (I would do it every day if I had time!), I use a facial mask for about 20 minutes.  I've tried two of them... a $6-7 Sulfur-based mask (works the best, this price lasts me about a month+), and a clay-mask this lady at Target talked me into buying for around $9.  Both seem to work well - my face feels a little uncomfortably dry afterwards, but I put on more of the Salicylic Acid moisturizer immediately and it's fine.  

At first, and now I no longer use the BP (I haven't had anything on my  neck in 2 months, probably).  Now, on the off-chance I do get a pimple, it's usually around my mouth and I'm certain it's caused by me touching my face too much.  The pimples only last like a day and they never get big and inflamed.  

Anyway, and following it up with a moisturizer that contains salicylic acid.  I started seeing positive results from the sulfur mask almost immediately.

First clue that I think it's hormonal acne is that it goes by cycles. Usually I have a few very good weeks where I'm pretty clear (again never completely) and then a few awful weeks with tons of pimples and red spots and stuff.

Recently (past 6 months or so) I've had mild acne on my upper back

My lifestyle in regards to acne:

-I shower once a day at least

-I switch my pillow covers often. Also I was just on vacation for two weeks (so you know the pillows in the hotel are clean everyday) and my acne still didn't clear up.

-I use a face-soap from Clean &amp; Clear every night

-I read somewhere that Vitamin D helps clear up acne. I'm a lifeguard since mid-June and have been getting plenty of sun

-I exercise four-five times a week so my body is healthy

-**Big one** Ever since June 17 (day I started my job and started a workout routine), but my acne hasn't cleared up. I always read that drinking water is a great way to clear acne. I've been drinking tons of water and only water, and it hasn't helped.

I am a 24 year old male and I had moderate acne on body and face.  Nothing worked for me until I bought this product on a whim.  I use it daily even though it has the exfoliating beads in it.  I have used it twice a day on some days and my skin has not dried out or became itchy and irritated.  The product that has helped me is...

Biore: Acne Clearing Scrub
http://thisthatbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Biore-Acne-Clearing-Scrub-.jpg

I use this in the shower and let it stay on for about 5-7 minutes before washing it off.  I use this on body as well as my face.  Best results are on chest/face.  Back has improved but not as much as other areas.  

Another thing I noticed that helped my face out was using an electric shaver.  This is less offensive on the skin which does make a difference.  Both of these combined have improved me vastly.  I rather not post pics and stay anonymous

Some other tips that have been said before but also seem to help are:

1.  Stop touching your face with your hands
2.  For body
3.  Drink lots of water.
4.  Do not shower with super hot water.  Warm to cool helps close pores. 
5.  Stay away from sugary snacks and food.

I figured it's from junk food, but nope, I cut junk food for a while, yet I still suffered from it. I tried eating healthy, ate foods with proteins, vitamins, still have acne. I'm approaching college very soon and I'm really self conscious about it. My self esteem is dying because of this issue

I've had stress since I was 11-12, but it's not as severe as it was when I was a kid.

I've tried eggs in the morning, rice with chicken, rice with tomatoes and meat, fish, fried chicken, salad, yet I still can't see any progress.

Could it be a problem with my testosterone levels? I'm 17 and I can't manage to grow facial hair yet


I was okay with it as it wasn't very severe, A LOT. It's under my skin and even chewing/opening my mouth makes it hurt.

I had acne on my chest, but it all went away, there's a little left on the chest here and there, markings of past pimples, but it's almost gone, but my face, oh god it just won't go away.

So a couple of months ago I noticed all my friends who have great skin do nothing and thought I may as well give it a try. It worked! (sort of). My forehead which normally would get big whiteheads stopped and cleared out pretty nicely. If I do get something it's a little bump that will be gone by the next day. 

However

My forehead and chin are the oily ones but not washing them seems to work fine. But it seems as if my cheeks which are drier reacted better to being washed everyday

So yeah since stopping washing my face with soap I've gotten maybe a couple whitehead zits but mainly just irritated big red spots on one side of my cheek. My cheeks feel soft but along the mid to bottom jawline and a little in the center there are so so many clogged pores. The cheek that breaks out also feels more oily than the other side. If they are big I can squeeze the stuff out of them and it's fine but some go from being too small to squeeze to really inflamed.

I bought some jojoba oil but I'm afraid that might make the clogged pores irritated and make me break out.

My diet has nothing to do with it. (It's been consistent before and after this problem with no different meal changes and I don't eat dairy or meat and hardly ever eat sugar from non-fruit)

Has anyone ever had any of these problems? Found any solutions? Any advice? 

(Also don't know if dryness would contribute to this but the spots on my forehead fade in like 2-3 days whereas spots on my cheeks will remain for months. I'm guessing oil may have something to do with this too?)


Edit: I use this glycolic exfoliator aha product and it lightens past spots but doesn't really reduce my clogged pores

become. This information leads me to Acne.org where I find a 2.5 BP treatment that has good reviews and a community that seems very supportive.


So I moved to a 5% BP med: Clean and clear 3 in 1. The white heads subsided A BIT

So now the plan is to let my skin recover from the dryness and then try the BP treatment from Acne.org.

So, not as dry as the 10 and 5 BP treatments, but dry enough to allow the whiteheads to keep coming.

So I quite the neutragena after a week and decide to just go the Cetaphil clenser


So I started only washingh my face with water, still dry.

Now I'm only wash my face with water and go right to the lotions because I've heard that is a good way to trap the water on your skin.

Any advice to give would be appreciated, so a part of me is hopeful (and hope is a rarity for me when it comes to my skin) that if I'm just able to get my skin back to a healthy state that I'd find that my acne has subsided (naive, maybe, but I've been medicating for the last decade and a half, so how would I know :)).

I'm an American living in China (I've been here for 8 months now) and about 2 months ago I had a sudden acne outbreak on my face. Never had this problem before and it has taken a big toll on my self-esteem. I've been fighting with it since then. Lots of factors could be at work here... stress, terrible pollution levels, etc.... I finally realized that the bad water quality of the water in my shower might be a factor I can actually change (I have to boil water to drink it, and the water has metals and chlorine in it, so why wouldn't it be bad for my skin? I can't believe I didn't figure that out sooner...) so I started washing my face with bottled water instead of washing in the shower, and I've seen some improvement since then, along with not eating dairy. 
I broke down and had my parents spend a large sum of money to send me a package of American products because the Chinese brands seem to irritate my skin more. Now I have some BP cleanser and some Clean &amp; Clear cleanser, Proactic moisturizer, and some salicylic acid cream. I also have a couple of different facial masks. My acne is starting to clear up but now my face, especially around my lips, is very dry and flaky. I cleanse twice a day and moisturize a lot. 

Two questions: 

I've read that using physical exfoliating products isn't that great because it could be more irritating. Should I try it? How often should I be doing it? Would it make my skin more dry

Should I be alternating the cleansers (like BP at night, but then I wash it and it's all red again. :/ 

Thanks in advance. I have been having a difficult time dealing with this.

1365279423.0,1btadk,Pantothenic Acid-The over-the-counter miracle drug,suhongy,6,1,8,"I'd like to bring attention to Pantothenic Acid

Here's a little Information on it:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantothenic_acid

**Edit: Routine

I started November 2012.

**Routine**

At the start I took 10 grams, no skipping, which depending on the brand equates to 10-20 pills. I spread the doses out out to 5 in the morning and 5 mid day/noon. It sounds like a lot, but it's not and worth it.

Now that I'm acne free I still take the pills to keep oil reduction  and maintenance down. I've switch brands but now consume between 0-5g per day depending on the stress level and how long I'm out for. If Stress = high I take more. During finals and such I would take 500-1000 mg per hour I was up past mid night.

I've tried spreading out the doses of 2000 mg per hour til I've reached 10000 mg

**Effects**

I saw significant oil reduction about 1 month in and STAGGERING oil reduction about 3 months in. Combine with a good salicylic acid based exfoliate wash and have been acne free since Jan. So huge results after 3-4 months. I've use the same wash without the pantothenic acid and still struggled with oil production and acne.

I've always struggled with oil production so I don't plan on ever getting off the Pantothenic Acid as a control for oil production as it's safe and effective. I know you can take accutane to permanently control oil production but that isn't an option now and maybe ever. 

**Brands**

[Pan Acid](http://www.amazon.com/Acid-Pantothenic-1000mg-Timed-Release/dp/B000NZDN2Y/ref=pd_bxgy_hpc_img_z/181-5974515-6532347)

The first brand I used was Pan acid 1000 mg timed release. These are great as they are timed released

However the price fluctuates too much

[Now Foods](http://www.amazon.com/Foods-Pantothenic-Acid-500mg-Capsules/dp/B0013OUQEM/ref=pd_sim_hpc_3/181-5974515-6532347)

My current brand is Now foods 500mg. You get 250 pills per bottle which gives you more for your $. The price is low and stays pretty constant at between 11-15$. These are encapsulated so they dissolve faster. They take a little more managing than Pan acid to get the dosage correctly spread throughout the day. The dosage is also less per pill so you’ll be taking in twice the pills as you would be with Pan acid. They do the job however but not as care free as Pan acid.

Finally found a regimen through trial and error and am now acne free!,secret_anus_man2,8,3,2,"I've pretty much tried everything short of Accutane over the years (Proactive, Tea Oil, then the oiliness/cystic acne comes back and I'm off to find another solution. This has been a cycle for 10 or so years for me but I've finally found a regimen/lifestyle that works for me. Decided I should share in case you guys can benefit from it too.

Morning:

Take a shower as soon as you wake up. No matter what

Once in the shower, make sure to clean with isopropyl alcohol) and brush until foam appears. Rinse off and once you're done showering your other parts, get out and immediately apply cold water (10-20 sec) to your face to close the pores.

Dry your face (pat) with a clean towel and apply a sulfur based product (Acnomel) mixed in a non-oily moisturizer ASAP. Warning

I know this is controversial

During the day:

AVOID touching your face. On the same note, so avoid processed starches and candy. I have noticed that after consuming large amounts of high GI foods, my face tends to 'sweat' and I feel that may contribute to acne. However, if you do have cravings like I do, just remember that moderation is key. Most important of all, remember to drink lots of water throughout the day! 1-3 water bottles should be enough. If you can, apply some sunscreen and get a little sunshine outside! It helps even out your complexion if you tan and hides some darker acne as well.

Night:

Shower before you sleep using the same regimen as the morning. If you have the time, try to maintain a constant sleeping schedule. If you do have to stay up all night, make sure to shower before and after since the stress will make your skin oil up.

Breakout Time (ughh):

Sadly, apply a thin layer of salicylic acid cleanser ONLY on the center of the bump and let it dry out overnight. After a night or two, the skin around it will peel away and a white center should appear. Use a needle to poke it (it should give way very easily, if you're poking with force then that's the wrong place) and with one motion swiftly pop it with a blackhead remover or disinfected hands. It should have that characteristic popping feeling/sound and some bleeding (gross.. right?).
 
Apply hydrocortisone for the redness and some sulfur product. Make sure to thoroughly clean the area around it since it will spread without proper care. If there is no popping, but I have used liquid whey from yogurt/crushed up aspirin to reduce this redness and bring out the whitehead also. Blackheads: if you have the urge, make sure to use a proper blackhead remover and get ALL of it out or else you risk infection/cystic acne. That generally means you'll have a gaping hole where the blackhead used to be. 

Cleanup:
If you're acne free

I've been using the aczone cream on my neck and after 2.5 weeks I really noticed the cysts (which were mainly unbroken/unpopped and below the surface) have really really shrunk (like I cant feel them anymore but I can still see a tiny red spot where they were in the mirror) and that I have no new ones. 

The one downside I have found with aczone is that it is not exactly clear. Its a white non-oily cream, however after about 15 minutes when it has dried it appears as visible white.  Due to this I haven't been using it twice a day like it says to, but only once at night and it's still working. (And I even missed a few nights). One major plus is that it will NOT bleach your clothes or pillows so it is totally safe to use and I love it way better than benzoyl peroxide. 

I definitely recommend you look into getting it if you have cystic acne (especially jawline subsurface bumps), like many other acne medications, it says ""the mechanism of action is unknown, but it is thought to be safe and effective"" except oral dapasone is commonly used as an antibiotic so it probably is an antibiotic too.

I have short hair which does not cover my forehead. I drink just about only water, not overweight. I walk a lot for my job and walking around school campus. That's my main exercise I get. Not sure what other dietary/bodily information could help with advice, but I'm more than open to give any information that could contribute to helping remove my blackheads/acne as a whole.

1360788454.0,18gtfn,Antibiotics Progress and Questions (pic in description) ,datderethrowacc,5,0,3,"Hey /r/acne. I've lurked this sub for awhile now and I decided to post a progress of my antibiotics treatment and I also had a couple questions to ask. To start off, and have continued till now

What I have used in the past:

* Neutrogena's Clean and Clear Cleanser

* Obagi Cleansiderm System

* ACV

* Lemon Juice

* Baking Soda Masks

* Dan's Regimen using Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser

My Current Regimen:

* Wash my face 2 times a day

* Apply Clindamycin at night post-cleanser

* Take 100mg of Minocycline with breakfast everyday
(side effects in the beginning were dizziness, and minor headaches) 

* Take an assortment of vitamins before sleep: (Multivitamin, 50mg Chelated Zinc, and Probiotics)

* I consumer over a gallon of water daily

* Wash with a new face cloth everyday

I am an active guy and I eat extremely clean, a lot of vegetables and my diet has not changed in the past year. I eat the same thing every day so diet could not be a contributing factor to my recent extreme breakout.

Anyways, the antibiotics have helped quite a bit in the short term, but I still have significant post-inflammatory hyper pigmentation and I understand that it will take quite a bit of time to fade. Not shown in the picture are macules left by other pimples located on my left cheek and on my temples. I am still trying to determine the cause of my localized pimples and I think it had to do with the way I would sleep at night, perhaps sleeping resting my head on my dirty hands as my blemishes form in a pattern that look like resting places for my hand. As well, the breakouts occur in a ski goggle formation so I assume that my prior poor hygiene when I used to ski may have caused certain areas of my skin to become more acne prone in my late teens. (Excuse long back story, but I felt that I should have explained the process till now to hopefully answer any prior questions that are commonly asked by community members when someone comes on looking for help.)

So, but I don't want to stay on antibiotics in the long term either due to health reasons. To those that went through an antibiotic treatment, what did you end up doing and did you see any success in keeping the acne in remission?

I use to have bad acne so bad it affected my entire life. Some days I wanted to die but I didnt want people to see my face full of acne at my funeral either. It just wasnt me it wasnt what I was meant to look like.  Everyone on here has or is going through the same thing I went through.... I tried it all but nothin worked. I even gave up at times and said there is no cure... the cream I use is called oxy 10% maximum strength benzoyl peroxide. I used it 4 years ago but saw my acne get worse so i stopped using it. 4 years later I read an article saying acne simply cannot survive in an oxygenated environment. For some reason I trusted this article. I went out and bought oxy cream again and said im gona put this on everyday I don't care if it gets worse or not.  2 weeks later it did indeed get worse... I doubted myself but I didn't care.  I kept going.  My face was red as shit it felt like sunburn all the time.  4 weeks in. I noticed pimples were still coming in but took only 2 days to disappear completely including the red marks... my old acne was still there... 2 months in. My old acne is only red marks...no fresh pimples at all for about 3 weeks now and my skin is no longer red from the oxy... 3 4 5 6 months later... red marks gone ...acne completely clear my skin is 100 percent adjusted to oxy like its moisturizer. 1.5 years later...  My life has changed 100 percent. I only use a quarter of a dime sized amount and it blends into my pale skin within seconds and im done for the day. I even find myself slacking off not using oxy for 2 to 3 days .... then I notice a pimple and use it and it goes right away.... dont ever give up on your acne. If u have pretty tough skin try oxy 10% bp ... its cheap as hell for a 4 pack on amazon... one day when I stop working 55 plus hours a week and get out of college full time I want to start eating better and see if I can fix my acne naturally.

* Cut out sugar, dairy.

* Eat only about two fruits a day since of the sugar content.

* Don't forget the veggies.

* Supplements which I'll cover in a little bit.

Okay, fiber, probiotics.  Probiotics are very important if you have acne.  Buy a supplement if you don't have any.  Fiber is also very important.  Go for 25 to 40 grams a day.  Both from whole grains &amp; fruit.

Important Supplements to Take.

Multivitamin are good but they tend to have low levels of zinc, and vitamin D.  So you have to buy additional ones to add to your multivitamin.  The ones I listed are all very important in fighting acne. ZINC, CHROMIUM, SELENIUM, VITAMIN D (along with your multivitamin).  PS - over 50 mg of zinc can be toxic.  I use Source optizinc (30 mg).

This next supplement is the bees knees in fighting acne.  It is your ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS.  I have Total EFA - vegetarian - the liquid one.  I highly recommend this brand.  The ratio of omega 3 to omega 6 should be 2:1 so I also take fish oil for more omega 3 in my diet.  I have Carlsons Finest Cod Liver Oil lemon flavored (liquid).  I love it.

But a week ago, which did help with my mood. Big mistake, broke out like crazy. And now I realize it is because of the Biotin. Now that I'm off the Biotin, things are returning to normal.

Yes my acne is older than most of you (okay, female, 38 years old, and still being plagued by the exact same skin problems that made me avoid social interaction and contributed greatly to my low self-esteem all throughout my teenage years, my twenties, and now most of my thirties.  The dermatologists always told me it'd go away with age... ok so by when, my 80s?? It just seems that at my age it should be a non-issue. Having to fight acne and wrinkles at the same, it totally sounds like a doozie of a first world problem

In all honesty, nor has the level of acne diminished since its onset as a teen. It's extremely embarrassing at my age, and I have turned down social invitations and avoided people because of it.  Being recently divorced and single again, the idea of being ""out there"" with a pizza face is absolutely horrifying, and I'd probably just prefer staying home redditing my Friday nights away like tonight (not that there's anything wrong with that!) But still, there's that part of me that yearns to go out and have fun for once without wondering if people are staring at my pimple villages.   

Some background info:

- Tried a multitude of topical medications throughout the last 25 years, Retin-A, Differin, cleansers, astringents, lotions, etc.) Nothing really helped significantly. A lot of this stuff just burned my acne and made it look a thousand times worse. No long-term improvements.

- Used Proactiv on and off over the last 10 years.  Seems to always help in the beginning

- 2 years ago I was at my wit's end and finally went to see my derm to ask about Accutane. Man, take monthly blood tests, and take an online test every month that's intended to remind you how Accutane damages babies. This was serious stuff, so I was convinced this was the cure-all of my malady and I was so excited when my dermatologist agreed to start me on the program (yes, there's actually a program). I think I was on accutane for about 4 months, just a single dose per day. During that time I could not believe the transformation of my skin: soft, oil-free, and like porcelain. I had never been so happy in my life! I felt like it was a new dawn

- I cannot do oral antibiotics (e.g.

- Yes I've tried the pillowcase trick I learned here on reddit (using a clean pillow case every night.) Of course it didn't work for me or else this post would not exist!

Overall I am very healthy, meat only 2-3 times a week, and my diet is rich in fruits and veggies. I love dairy, but when I stopped dairy for awhile I noticed no change in my skin. I'm not aware of any food allergies, but could acne be a sole symptom of being allergic to something I eat regularly? When I do exercise (once in awhile) my acne just gets a lot worse because of all the sweat (great excuse for not exercising! It causes zits!)

And lastly, my neck, my hairline, my back, and my chest. In other words, everywhere. It's gross.

I am open to anyone's suggestions or comments or recommendations to try new things.

So about 3 months ago I was browsing for acne creams and came across Alpha Lipoic Acid as a topical treatment. Conveniently, only as a supplement for exercising. I decided to give it a shot. 

I use it before bed and in the morning. What I do is dampen a tissue a bit and wet my face. Then I gently twist open one of the capsules (don't pull or powder will get everywhere) and empty it onto the damp tissue. I then massage the powder all over my face and neck, I apply moisturizer, I use Vaseline for men, the fast absorbing kind with the green logo, but any moisturizer should be find. 

I've been using it for about 3 months now and the biggest difference I notice is the feeling it gives my skin. Just a few minutes after using it my skin feels wonderfully clean, my skin really feels amazing after using it. My acne is clear, my face isn't red and it may even be helping to prevent razor burn on my neck.

I dampen my face with warm water

I apply Burt's Bees Peach and Willowbark Deep Pore Scrub to my entire face

Afterwards I wash it off with warm water then apply Neutrogena's Oil Free Acne Stress Control Power-Cream Wash on my entire face. I massage it into my face for thirty seconds then wash off.

I dab my face with a paper towel but leave it slightly damp. I then massage two or three drops of bio-oil onto my face. It soaks into my skin and doesn't leave any shine. After the bio-oil I apply a dime sized amount of Black Rice face cream with SPF15. Here are the pictures taken directly after the regimen: [Acne without make-up](http://imgur.com/a/oWvNu#0)

I've minimized the use of make-up. I use a very small drop of Neutrogena's Oil Free Makeup and apply it only to my problem areas with a brush. Here's how it looks like: [Acne with make-up](http://imgur.com/a/Uplq0#0)

My biggest issue is redness and what I think are blackheads. My chin area is the biggest problem area because it can get dry and flaky even after moisturizer.

 A lot of people have said drinking eight glasses of water a day would help with the skin. For the past three days or so I've been doing exactly that and I've seen a slight improvement. If in the next two weeks I see dramatic results then I'll update you guys. Feel free to ask any questions.

I'm 26f. I always had acne growing up, but switched to the Mirena IUD in 2010. Four months after I switched, I started breaking out horribly, and it's cystic, to make it all worse. And I'm a picker, even worse.
I know it's the worst thing to do to pick or force a cyst to pop. They destroy all the skin around and get twice as big and take twice as long to heal.
I have one on my smile line so bad right now, clients to meet, and my face looks like I have a flesh eating disease on it.
I wear full makeup, sea salt, tea tree oil, ice, calamine lotion, whatever I have around. I go almost into a panic state and freak out for hours, all the while I can't go outside because I don't want anyone to see.

It's not every day I'm like this - sometimes I don't get cysts for weeks, 4, 5, sometimes one pops up right next to another. I had a wound so bad on my chin, the scar changed the shape of my chin's actual outline when it healed.
And I have pink scars all over my goddamn face.

I have a high-deductible insurance plan
I met a woman once
I have a feeling this is just incurable - my mother has adult acne, just not as bad as me.

I've been on Spironolactone, every natural remedy you can think of, drank vinegar, and even tried tanning my face clear. Nothing works.

It is called Sotret (20mg and 10mg) and to get it,HUGE boost of confidence.

Now I've been able to manage the stress easily but the hormone imbalance remained for a quite long time because was impossible find a cause and a solution.
Obviously things change from male to female

After the Accutane possibility I decide to go trough different medications. I did not wanted to risk that much for some acne! No way! So I start this process.
I've been under antibiotics medications for 2 month. the med was MINOCYCLINE.I did not prolong the use of this med at 4 months because after 2 months I had visible and GREAT results.
I am still using daily two lotio
day= ERYTHROMYCIN- BENZOYL PEROXIDE topical gel
night= TRETINOIN CREAM
Both of this lotions are great. There is no need of huge quantity

It is sad to realize that even doctor do not know exactly why acne happen and find a cure is a guess

1. Do not rely on product that you can find in place like walmart
When I was still in Italy I used EAU THERMALE AVENE brand
Now I am in U and I wasn't able to find this product so I rely on Neutrogena gel soap tat works pretty well.
Two or 3 times at week I use a scrub soap. 
After washing my face I put some peroxide on a cotton ball and this help me a lot to maintain my face clean

But after all the medication and cleaning process I decide to bring some changing in my diet.

2-Eating habit
I am taking ALOE VERA at least once a day. Same thing with green tea. More toxins you have inside and better it is. Not just for acne

No more sugars of any type. I was addicted to chocolate. I needed to rid off. Enough said that every time that I indulge on some chocolate a breakout appears the day later. Coincidence? Mha!

As I said before I had huge hormone imbalance. I took pills for years and I was never able to fix it definitely

Even if you will never believe it
And I loved eat meat. Especially barbecued ones!
But...
after that I quit eat meat I needed to take under control the amount of protein intake. I rely on lean protein (beans) but do not take big amount of tofu or soy milk

Another factor the contribute at my hormones imbalance was my sleeping habits. For one year my circadian cycle was abnormal and a lot of your of weakness during the night and sleep during the day is bad. During the night and during the sleep our brain produce the melathonin that contribute in hormone balance/imbalane. Now I ave my schedule 6.00 am awake. sleepy night night at 22.00/23.00.

3. make up. less you use better it is. Oh yes

Btw guys
I hope my experience will be useful for some of you. Now after 9 months of all of this I can declare my self free from acne. 
And please don not struggle if you see some break out right before your period. IT IS NORMAL! every girls have it. Maybe in less quantity but everyone does. And acne during adolescence is normal. 
Rememeber if you stressed out for your acne is goin to get worse. stress affect acne because stress affect your hormones! Some work out will be your best ally for this battle!
Trust me!

1370403570.0,1fp70z,My story of dealing with acne and what I believe works and doesn't work.,ur2fat4u,7,2,6,"Hey everyone

Over the 8 years of living with acne, for all those years she refused to take me because she always thought that prescription drugs were never the answer and she wanted to try every natural remedy there was like face masks and tea tree oil. 

When I went to the dermatologist he prescribed Tazorac and Duac to me. This was the first time I've ever seen any improvement in my skin and I was so incredibly happy. The huge pimples became less frequent and the little red ones and white heads decreased by a bit. But eventually my skin stopped clearing up and I still had a lot of acne left. That's when I then switched to antibiotics and Benzaclin. 

During the eleventh grade I was taking Benzaclin and Tetracycline (antibiotic) and they were great! My skin was finally clearing up

In the twelfth grade of high school I really tried to change my daily habits and I did some research. I went back to my dermatologist and he prescribed to me Differin .3 and Doxycycline (antibiotics). Let me just say that the Differin really helped even after I stopped taking the Doxycycline. I was ecstatic and felt really confident in my self. But I not only changed up my medication but also what I ate

Senior year was very stressful for me because I was class president and I had to plan many events and fundraisers in a short amount of time and there were many nights where I would get stressed out and get a few hours of sleep. My acne was definitely linked to stress because all throughout middle school and high school I had a high course load and I would stay up incredibly late. My outlet senior year was working out. I went to the gym 5 times a week and worked out different areas of my body each day. Not only that but I cut out every single junk food there was. I can't remember the last time I had soda when I wasn't drinking (chasers). 

There is no simple solution to acne and I understand what you guys are going through but I hope that my solutions can help you guys out. 

**What I do**

* Exercise regularly! Not only will you be doing your body a huge favor but you will also feel incredible about your body and gain some confidence

* Drink plenty of water! I found this out more recently after a trip to Florida. In Florida it was incredibly hot and I was drinking almost a gallon of water a day. When I came back, I mean straight up water maybe with some orange slices in it. 

* Take a look at your diet and cut out the greasy, grab some greek yogurt!

* For the love of God

I really hope all these suggestions have helped you guys in some way. I know a lot of the shit that I said is repetitive but unless you make a serious decision to change your habits

I am really not sure what to do anymore to get rid of my adult acne. Dermatologist says it’s not bad enough for accutane but I have slowly tried to get off the gel's and such but i start to break out again once I do.

I am really at a loss of what to do and this battle with acne has left me with zero self-confidence and really made me recluse in life. I was a fun person who was always out enjoying the sun rays in the summer but now I try to avoid the sun or wear a hat and just kind of hide my face because the acne and scars bum me out.

At this stage I don't know what to do anymore... I can’t think of another doctor to see to figure out my issues and my skin seems it’s just becoming more and more oily

Anyway. Nothing has really worked that well

I recently decided to try and avoid dairy.

Voila!

Zero whiteheads in the past two months

**Tips to test for yourself:**

* Avoid ALL substantial dairy for a week. Then you can start forgiving things like small amounts of dairy sauces or stuff cooked with butter.

* Watch your skin the 2-3 days after you eat dairy.

**Summary**

* I'm super glad to have done this.
* Is there anything else that might cause it for me
* Are there any supplements I could take before/after consuming dairy to reduce the effect? I'm assuming the reason dairy causes it is due to the insulin spike dairy causes. There are definitely supplements that can blunt insulin spikes.

**You!**

Given how awesome this has been for me, or possibly identify other things that did.

The theory behind what I'm doing is scientific (as a biologist

As you may know, localized to pustules.

Although I didn't culture them

-Wash my face to clean the area of dirt and general microorganisms. 

-Use H2O2 or hydrogen peroxide or some antimicrobial to kill what was on my face. Air-dry - this is important because you need to give the H2O2 time to work.

-Wash hands with hand sanitizer or soap and then use water to moisturize face. I used distilled water at first but I think regular tap works too.

-Let the water dry off sort of and use a clean towel to get the rest off (I change out my towels regularly).

-Add an anti-inflammatory like salicylic acid (I use Burt's bees) to reduce any pre-existing or forming inflammation.

-Apply a topical moisturizer. I cannot stress how important it is to disinfect your hands before this. This is also important if you have oily skin. The peroxide will dry out your skin and may lead to oversecretion of oils
