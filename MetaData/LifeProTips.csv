  1. There were several videos posted that (more or less) tried to follow the protocol. All of them showed the same fare in incognito mode. [One video] (http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1ekv6e/lpt_bounty_1_year_of_reddit_gold_to_the_first/ca1bf28) showed a different fare
  2. It's certainly not as easy as most people say it is. Over 20, anyone who says this works a large fraction of the time, or that the effect can be summoned on demand, is wrong.  
  3. Two people *did* manage to get [different results in Kayak](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1ekv6e/lpt_bounty_1_year_of_reddit_gold_to_the_first/ca19wg1). This is not really the LPT we were investigating (in one case it was more expensive in incognito mode
  4. I'm really comfortable calling this an urban myth until someone can actually show otherwise. Nothing will ever convince certain people, or accept that it's possible they made a mistake once while entering search parameters.

Many people said there were problems with my protocol. Objections raised include: (1) you need more time to prepare (2) it only works with round-trip flights (3) it doesn't work in the United States (4) the LPT is wrong and you need to clear your cookies instead of going incognito (5) the LPT is wrong and you need to use different computers or IPs.

Here's the thing: I'm not stopping you from making any video you want. I can't _promise_ I'll give gold for it, based on the interest shown here.  Just saying. And I'd be happy to help review your video to give you advice on how to eliminate errors and make sure it actually proves what it's trying to prove.

**Original Post follows:**

[A common LPT](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/13mdr5/lpt_if_you_want_to_buy_the_cheapest_airline/) is that airline prices are different in Incognito Mode. It's true for some online shopping

I'm looking for someone to prove me wrong. If you're the first to provide _actual video evidence_

 * Your video must follow my strict protocol (given below). The point of the protocol is to reduce errors and potential for tampering.
 * If you post a video that fails to follow the protocol
 * If you need the protocol changed
 * You must post a link to the video in this thread within 3 hours of recording it.
 * This offer is good for 24 hours ~~(but I'll consider extending it if it hasn't been claimed)~~.

Flight search video protocol (version 2):

&gt; You must stick with a single browser and a single flight search website for the entire video.  
&gt; * Acceptable browsers: Chrome, Opera, Safari  
&gt; * Acceptable websites: Expedia
&gt; * Or use the website of one of these airlines: Alaska, Frontier, Hawaiian, JetBlue, Southwest, United, USAir

&gt; 1. Open a browser window of the [Times Square webcam](http://www.earthcam.com/usa/newyork/timessquare/). The date and time must be visible. This window must remain visible for the entire video.
&gt; 2. Perform a flight search in a regular browser window.
&gt; 3. Perform the same search in a window in private/incognito mode.
&gt; 4. Perform the same search in a regular window again.

&gt; The windows in steps 2, until the results appear. You can optionally close the windows from steps 2, 3, and 4 before going on to the next step. You can use the same window for steps 2 and 4. You must not perform any other searches or visit any other web pages during the video.

&gt; Your flight search **must** be for 1 adult, flight only (no hotels etc.). You can choose any departure city, arrival city, and date, but only one of each: do not select nearby airports, flexible dates, time of departure, but do not change any settings or preferences on the search website.

&gt; The same flight (same date, and flight numbers) must appear in all 3 results, and it must have the same price in steps 2 and 4, and a different price in step 3. The difference in price must be at least $10 USD. Each time, you must clearly show all the search parameters. On the results page, the parameters of the search must be visible.

&gt; Make sure the uploaded video is high enough resolution that the necessary text is readable.

1356504149.0,15gh9j,LPT: What to look for when buying a used vehicle.,Swagger_Lacking,5855,2759,305,"Mileage doesn't mean much

Look at the tires. Worn on edges generally means either worn wheel bearings or bad alignment. BRAND NEW tires is usually a ""quick fix"" for this and masks the problem for a few thousand miles.

Look at the body lines where the doors

Look at the paint. It should all be the same color completely all the way around. If it is slightly different shades on panels or in the door jams it usually means body work was done and they did not match the color correctly. Look for bubbles in paint or very small holes in body panels (could be ""tip of iceberg"" for rust and could lead to serious body work shortly down the road).

Inspect the underside of the car. I have personally seen cars with less than 30

Be wary of later model cars with low miles. 1992 22

Test drive the car and drive it harder than you normally would drive it. Accelerate hard and brake hard listen for odd noises coming from engine or transmission

Try all windows, keys in all doors and trunk. Not hard to change a door or hood for another of same color and most people forget to change the lock cylinder. Another sign it may have had a small accident.

Ask for maintenance log or records of upkeep. Did they change the oil every 3-5

Look under the hood are there signs of recent cleaning? (not always a bad thing on a overall clean car but many people pressure wash engines that leak oil so they look nice). Pull the engine oil dipstick (is it low on the stick or very high up the stick. Is the oil clean or black like they have not changed it recently). Pull the transmission oil dipstick (only automatics have this generally. The fluid should be a nice red color and shouldn't glimmer like it has glitter in it. smell it YES smell it. It shouldn't smell burnt.) Remove the radiator cap ONLY IF ENGINE IS COLD! Coolant should be either Green

Check all windows for cracks or chips. Chipped windows can become cracks sometimes and can be pricy if you don't have glass coverage.

Look at dash with key in run position (Not running) and look for check engine light. If light doesnt show at all then it is either burned out or removed. Owner could be hiding a major problem. With car running there should be no dash lights. At most the seatbelt light may be on if you don't have the seatbelt buckled.

Check the heater controls and be sure the positions change as well as the temperature and fan speeds. Does the A/C work? (may seem like it works great on a cooler weather day such as 60 degrees out but really doesn't work well.

Don't always trust them with sayings like ""My mechanic said it just needs a sensor that is $30"". Sure that sounds nice but why didn't they have it fixed if it is a cheap part? Could be that part along with a ton of labor (lots of $$$$) or could be something worse than that part and they are making it sound better. Also be careful if they include the parts needed to fix in the deal. Once again they may know something you don't about fixing that part.

Grab wheels and shake them both at the top and the sides. If you notice something seems loose it could be ball joints

One of the biggest things is DO NOT let them tour you around the car until you have looked it over yourself. Also don't be afraid to ask questions about something.

Is it a smoker car or non-smoker. With the heat on in a non smoker car you shouldn't smell any smoke (smoke smell is almost impossible to get out of heater vents). Also look for burns in the seats

Remove the spare tire from the trunk and look for signs of dampness or rust. When trunk seals go it tends to gather here and rust the trunk floor out.

Be sure to closely inspect cars with aftermarket lights, hoods and so on. Aftermarket parts are usually cheaper then OEM parts and could be accident cover up!

Ask when the timing belt has been replaced (applies to cars with timing belts and not timing chains) They have a replacement interval and could fail if not replaced at or close to this mileage. Broken timing belts could cause very expensive engine damage.

Im sure there are many many more things to look for but this is a pretty good list of things I look for when buying cars.

**EDIT: Also Google the vehicle you are going to look at. Many times Google will lead you to sites that tell you common problems with the vehicle. Example: 2003-2006 Ford 6.0L Diesels had many head-gasket problems. You can use this knowledge to see if the owner has had this problem addressed. If not you may be able to talk the price down some to pay for the problem to be fixed.**

**EDIT 2: I see a lot of comments regarding buying from dealers. In a good world yes most people would deal with one. But there are a large group that buys from private people. This post is directed more towards that. Its off figuring you show up to some guys house to look at his car. Although these are also great things to look for anytime you buy a vehicle.**

**EDIT 3: To people saying things such as ""You need to jack it up"" or ""Misaligned panels doesn't always mean accident"". I know I'm saying your driving down the road a private party has a car in their front yard. You stop in to give it a look-over. Here is a list to help you out.

Protip.  I'm talking about a room full of cigarette or other consumed smoke.  If your house is on fire throw that wet towel over your head and GTFO.  :)

&gt;This works because smoke is a colloid. A colloid ""is a substance microscopically dispersed throughout another substance"". This example of a colloid is a solid suspended in gas. The solid particles in the smoke will stick to the wet portion of the towel therefore eliminating the smoke.

From my own experience

* Stop drinking caffeine.  Cut it out entirely.  Take aspirin for the couple days of headaches.  Then when you need it once a month, never in the evening (it has a **half** life of around 5 hours).
* Stop making up lost sleep on the weekends, re-evaluate your life (I used to be an MMORPG addict and now regularly go weeks without playing a game).
* Stop snoozing / setting multiple alarms.  Snooze sleep is not worthy sleep.  Set your alarm for the last possible time you can get up (I don't mean like ""not even time to shower"" but the last possible time to do your entire morning routine with a little urgency).  Then train yourself to get up as soon as it goes off.
* Regular exercise (any kind of exertion; walking a few miles a day totally counts) is really important
* Light can be more powerful (but shorter lasting) at keeping you awake than caffeine.  In the morning get that awakeness you lost giving up caffeine by opening the windows and letting the sun shine in.  But you also need to give yourself a sense when it's getting dark so your body can wind down.  Dimmers are cheap and easy to install.  Make sure your alarm clock isn't a beacon of light.  Put sticky notes over it if you have to dim it
* Oh it's an hour before bed-time and it takes 45 to 90 minutes to play a round of a video game?  NO.  BAD.  Even at 45 minutes that's a lot of light in your face right before bed.  Honestly you're better off spending that last hour with some human contact (in a low light area) or (at least for me with some self control) on reddit with the enhancement suite's dark background on.
* When you do wake up in the middle of the night
* The bed is for sleeping and sex, I bought blackout curtains and keep mine as dark as possible.
* Dunno about diet though I generally don't worry about mine.  Do you wake up hungry and then can't fall back asleep?  Eat more non-sugary foods before bed (okay maybe not *right* before bed but soon enough).  Capping the night with a small sugary food can be a digestive aid
* I found myself futily waking up many nights because I was too warm.  I then read somewhere that your body temperature naturally goes up at a certain point in your sleep.  I bought a programmable thermostat for my central A/C in the summer (apologies if you don't have this option)
* Establish boundaries with your bed-mates.  If they are disruptive
* Don't ever use any kind of drug to help yourself sleep.  Count your alcoholic drinks and switch to water at the appropriate amount of time before your planned bed time.  Think of it like planning to have your hangover as you're falling asleep

You could respond, I swear.* But effectively this is two heads butting; the one with greater force wins.

Instead

Say something like: *Why are you upset? What do you think I was doing? Is it that I'm late that bothers you

Rather than arguing back and forth, or you'll see that you were wrong, or she'll see that she was being unreasonable.

I gave a very sexist example,* say, *Do you think animals were meant to be in captivity?* Wording your point of view in the form of a question forces them to see it from your perspective whether they like it or not, because a question psychologically puts them in a position where they have to answer it.

You see a lot of ads like this on craigslist, no experience required, for something called ""Outsourced Marketing"" or ""Direct Marketing."" Links like these tend to proliferate on craigslist. When I went to write this post, I figured I would have to do some searching to find them. Turns out, there were multiple ones posted in the last week.

http://newjersey.craigslist.org/mar/3787127761.html
http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/fbh/3846462232.html

Here's a paragraph about what one of these companies says they do:

""At LIFE Long Island

LIFE Long Island has had incredible success with its current and past clients employing a business to business marketing plan in many industries including telecommunications, and merchant processing. Our account managers are professional, knowledgeable, and adaptable to the changing needs of today's small and medium sized businesses. We utilize a strong marketing system while integrating a personable approach to make sure to satisfy the needs of the business owner as well as the client we are representing.""

You may have noticed that a lot of proffesional sounding buzzwords later

Door to door sales. 

The company I got an interview with, does door to door office supplies sales. They order supplies cheaply off amazon, and then send their door to door salesmen to resell them to offices, advertising it more cheaply than if they ordered from Staples or Office Maxx. 

These salesmen get paid on commision, unpaid ""Second Interview"" that's basically a day's work for no money. Secondly, many of these companies don't actually pay commission to their employees, but screw them out of it. Life Long Island, apparently, paid someone who posted on Ripoff Report 130 a week, even after he made quite a bit in commision. 

Because of these practices, no matter what, you will be a strong candidate. For your second interview, you're told to wear comfortable shoes. Odd? Because you'll have to walk around all day, following door to door salesmen. 

Now, was informed what they really do, and then promptly backed out. The next week, a friend of mine got an interview at a different ""Direct Marketing"" company with a suspicious website, and we proceeded to maybe read every single piece of info in existence on this. 

Many of them are pyramid scheme type places that are affiliated with Cydcor. They tend to train people how to set up their own ""Marketing"" companies that do the same thing. But there's a massive amount of turnover due to the shitty practices, have had to change their names when they get in trouble with the state. 

I see posts on Craigslist ALL THE TIME for companies like these, then please, correct me, because every single thing I've read about this has been awful. 

TLDR: Entry Level ""Direct Marketing"" and ""Outsourced Marketing"" is a scam. It's door to door sales.

If you don't know what you're talking about

If you **do** know what you're talking about, stand back, and let us do our job. I'm not saying you shouldn't keep a watchful eye on your technician if you have the ability to do so, I'm just saying that you shouldn't hang over their shoulders trying to, for lack of a better phrase, ""talk shop"" with them. 9 times out of 10, as long as the shop doesn't have a rule against it, mechanics will gladly let you. Gaining their permission to do so is generally a solid indicator of how confident the shop is in their work, and something bad can happen before you even realize it.

**Call us out**. If for any reason you aren't comfortable with what we're telling you needs to be done, and will do everything in their power to divert you away from their bullshit (and, in some extreme cases, will actively push you to authorize the work knowing full well you have no clue what they're telling you.)

Nearly every mechanic out there has an eidetic memory when it comes to cars and their owners. If you treat us like trash even when we're being patient and polite, and if we're allowed to, will often give you a small discount.

There are **very** few truly shady shops out there. From my experience, trusting mechanics with the life of you and your family yet treating them all like moronic swindlers is not a polite thing to do. Assume that they **are** trustworthy, until they give you a reason to believe otherwise.

With that in mind, shablam...they've got a stooge for life. Given the nature of shady shops, they don't require a large number of customers, just a cadre of very gullible ones. As other posters have mentioned in the comments though, it's extremely rare to find a shady person working in an otherwise squeaky-clean shop, as they get run out pretty quickly. As a general rule, either the whole shop is crooked

Very unfortunately, women are more willing to get work done on their vehicles precisely because they don't understand what is being told to them (I know there are some incredibly kick-ass female technicians out there, but generally, this is the case.) As a result, women are given bigger writeups/less discounts in the hopes that they'll just say ""screw it"" and agree to have things done. Highly reputable shops will **never** do this, but even relatively decent ones sometimes will. It's an unfortunate pock mark on the industry.

A shop that has a competent, a shop foreman is responsible for things like inventory, customer service issues, and in really smartly run places, things like ticket allocation for specific repair needs. For example, if Josh can do magical things with a welder and a Huth pipe bender, and Arnie can properly align the rear camber of a riced-out Civic, but the point is that a skilled foreman (**with both cars AND people**) usually means a solid operation.

People are often miffed about going in for a simple oil change, say something looks like there's even a 10% chance of being bad (or going bad in the near future), and a shop doesn't tell you about it, and then two days later it breaks. Who are you likely to blame: the car, or the shop you just went to? Liability and ass-coverage is the name of the game, dear poster. I assure you that their goal isn't to piss you off. Most of the reputable places will wince at doing it, but will still do it all the same. 

If you want to give your mechanic a little treat (which, any kind of food or drink that fits with the time of year is a solid bet. Soup, coffee, etc in the winter, or super-cold drinks or sandwiches in the summer. Something that isn't too sugary or soda-like is actually preferred...they might tell you they would prefer soda, but trust me, they don't. Hydration is what they want. Mechanics are also known to be fond of gifted six-packs

There are many issues that can honestly seem like they're coming from one part in the vehicle

Here's a basic example: your check engine light comes on. You take it to the shop, and sends you on your way. Three days later, the light comes back on, and the same code is tripped. Turns out that, yes, the sensor was indeed bad, but so was your catalytic converter. Since the sensor was downstream of the converter, but that wasn't necessarily the root cause of the problem.

This doesn't mean the mechanic is dumb or bad at their job! It just means they might not have a lot of experience, and there are a near infinite number of things that can go wrong. Everyone screws up sometimes.

It's also important to remember that being a mechanic is **brutal**. This can vary depending what shop you work in, you're still essentially weight-lifting and doing cardio for 8-12 hours a day, 5-6 days a week.

It's a very tough but very rewarding job. Knowing that someone is able to get their kid to daycare and then get to their job safely all because of the work that **you personally do** is immensely satisfying. Likewise, but all good mechanics never make the same mistake twice.

2) Pull up beside the car in front of the space. Exactly beside them. Your back bumpers should be pretty much lined up.

3) Cut the wheel **all the way** to the right and back up watching your right side view mirror. 

4) Stop backing up as soon **as you can no longer see the car parked in the space behind you** in your right mirror.

5) straighten the wheel out and back **straight back** until the front of your car can clear the back bumper of the front car.

6) Cut the wheel **all the way** to the left and continue backing into the space

7) Once you're in the spot straighten your wheel out and make sure you leave about equal room in front of and behind your car

YOU'RE AWESOME AT PARALLEL PARKING!!!!

If you need to get a bit closer to the curb remember that each time you scoot forward or back you'll need to cut the wheel AND straighten it out with each back and forth. If you don't do both your literally just retracing your own tracks.

I also recently switched jobs and did a substantial amount of interviewing. I received numerous offers before I accepted my current position. 

Every now and then I see some advice about interviewing on this sub that I find questionable


* Look put together. 

Ask your recruiter/HR contact what the dress code is during the phone screen or in-person interview scheduling process. If he or she says business casual, and dress shoes. Dress code is highly debate and some interviewees say ""If I can't wear a t-shirt to the interview, I won't be a cultural fit!"" - great, this tip is how to get a job, not how to avoid getting one. If you must look ""casual"" without asking about the dress code, at least wear a polo.

Being put together is more than dress code

* Be memorable

This means that they should think you're a good dude or dudette from the beginning. As soon as anyone walks into the interview room

This also means that you should do things like asking ""What would my typical day/week look like in this position?"" or ""How many members would be on my team and can I meet any of them?"" This gives you a glimpse of the actual job itself

* Don't be bashful.

Interviews are not a time to be humble. You need to outperform every single other person that's interviewing. If someone asks, I haven't,"" it is ""I've worked with Y extensively and I've been dying to get my hands on X. I know that a lot of skills overlap between the two, but I haven't had a chance to use X yet. I've kept up on it and my strong background in Y makes me confident I'd pick up on X quickly.""

* Do some research about the company beforehand.

Walking in knowing that they just landed a huge customer or moved to a new office building gives you a talking point if there is any downtime in the interview

* Always have questions.

No job is ever how it's presented during the interview. You need to make sure that it's a good fit for you. Yes, then you should be vetting them as much as they are vetting you. Things like ""On the way out, could you show my where my work area would be?"" or ""Can I meet any members of the team?"" or even ""How long have the most senior and most junior members of my team been here?"" will all give insight into the conditions/culture. You want to avoid high turnover, but you also want to avoid lifers and a team of geriatrics if you're a younger up-and-comer.

I am not a writer or editor. I am a science/math person who struggled with writing in college.  I used the following formulas to improve my essay grades.

Note: I am skipping the usual advice on proofreading, etc.

A. **Transitions.** Use liberally.  They add fluidity to papers and make you sound less robotic.  Examples include furthermore, in addition, in contrast, and moreover.  Look up more examples.  There are two general formulas to use transitions.  TRANSITION + COMMA + CLAUSE.  SUBJECT + COMMA + TRANSITION + COMMA + PREDICATE.

* ex: Medieval art is characterized by the depiction of religious figures.  **In addition

* ex: Ukarine does not have any natural environmental hazards.  The **country

**EDIT:** Some comments below have brought to my attention that [it may be bad style to start a sentence with ""however"" though it is grammatically correct.](http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/starting-a-sentence-with-however.aspx)

B. **The semicolon.** Considered the ""cherry on top"" that adds sophistication to a paper.  Use sparingly.  Too often

* ex: Heroin is a prodrug that metabolizes into **morphine; therefore

* ex: Researchers have found that playing violent video games does not cause violent **behavior; on the contrary

C. **Not only this

* ex: **Not only** does regular exercise prevent cardiovascular disease

Don't forget the ""also.""  Common mistake.

D. **Show.**  Use words like show

* ex: The rise in teenage pregnancy in communities that have banned contraceptive education **demonstrates** that abstinence only sex education has no place in the classroom.

If you want to highlight a point or argument, and underscore.

If the evidence does not directly show a conclusion or the evidence is weak (e.g. a correlation), and implicate.

E. **The gerund.**  The gerund helps link two ideas in a single sentence.  It also helps vary sentence length and structure.  Again

* ex: Thoreau's ""Civil Disobedience"" describes the military as ""small movable forts and magazines"" **suggesting** that soldiers are mindless drones taking orders from a corrupt government.

1. After being introduced or asking their name remember it. Pretty basic right? Who doesn't feel valued when a new friend (and that's what you're doing

If for some reason you are introducing them to someone new say this is my friend ""insert name"". Is it cheesy? Maybe

2. Boundaries. They are important,  not because they think it is creepy but they don't want them to bug you.  b) You will hurt them. If I had a dime for every child that got hit by a rogue elbow or slipped from my grasp I would have two dimes.... Two very sad dimes.

3. Don't ask them about school. They like it ""okay"" and their favorite subject is recess.  There are a couple exceptions a)  If they bring it up and b) If you know a child of similar age/grade/teacher that they may know. 

4. So what do you talk about? Just like talking with an adult try and find similar interests. Sports

5. Learn a skill (also known as a kid friendly party trick). I have two card tricks and know how to make three kinds of paper airplanes  (simple enough to make in under a minute but complex enough to impress) up my sleeve at all times. 

6. Take the heat. Getting too loud? Paper airplane hit someone in the head? Take the fall

7. Don't be condescending. The only thing that separates them from adults is a little bit of time and experience. Don't make the mistake of thinking you're more intelligent than them

Wow, so it’s not something that you have to do, and if this doesn’t work for you, I don’t see why you should. The thing is that on this subreddit, I’ve seen posts before that I knew right away that it wouldn’t work for me, so I just ignored it. I thought that was the thing to do. Instead people started to rage about this and when I woke up this morning I wondered why I had 200+ comments where half said thanks and half of you hated it. 

I think the first misconception came when I had the word work out in the title. This is my first sign of “regret” that I probably should have used a different wording. In my native language, and it probably still is. But people assumed directly that work out is lifting weights and pumping on the gym. And you are probably right when you say that this doesn’t work while you are on a gym and lifting weights, but you also need to understand how many different kinds of workouts there is and my “go to” training is cardio. I have started a habit to run long and I’m now in a place that I have to run every day. I’m also a guy who over thinks EVERYTHING so if I  would listen to music, I would just think of the number of songs I’ve heard and with simple math trying to figure out my time, which seriously doesn’t work for me. I started to listen to audio books and only when running, and find myself lost in my audio book and my running and I could run for 45 min to an hour without thinking. So as I said in the beginning, this is a tip for people who maybe have problem going back to working out (which is a really important thing to do). 

I’ve also read some people saying things like “why don’t you just stop being a fat fuck and the motivation would be to not be a fat fuck” or something like that. While I first thought it was just a random troll, this tip helped me not to just lie down and feel sorry for myself and instead start running again. Motivation comes in all forms and sizes, and it’s not just for getting up from your couch and stop eating McDonalds or something.

If this is something that you tried now and it works for you, but as I said; English is not my native language so please don’t try to win any arguments by correcting my spelling.

If you come in person to interview or just to get an application, not ripped jeans and a dirty ""420 YOLO SWAG"" shirt.


When you are talking to people look them in the eyes and engage them. I can't tell you how many people come in to apply for a job and look at their shoes the entire time and mumble responses to my questions.


Make sure your application is readable. I have shit for hand writing but when I was filling out applications it looked like I got an A+ in hand writing class. If I can't read it


Put the cell phone away. If you are waiting for someone that is fine


If you have questions about hiring, not mom or dad. It is a sign of maturity and that you are responsible enough to follow up yourself. It is a huge red flag if mom is calling me every day to ask questions for you or to push me to give you a job.


source: I do HR at a decent size country club and have been doing the hiring for the last few years and have reviewed more than enough terrible applications and candidates.



Edit: Some of you gave some good advice as well so I will add it as well:



*Use a blue or black pen to fill out an application.



*Don't bring friends with you to apply. 



*Have a professional email address



*If possible hand an application to the manager not an employee.



*Don't show up when we are running around like mad people expecting anyone to talk to you or remember you.



*Don't apply too early (we forget about the application) or too late. Try and think of a reasonable time to apply



*Don't be late and don't have a poor excuse.

Abstract: An unwanted mind pattern can be removed using a simple method: Corrupt the pattern. 

Background: 

The human mind is good at learning patterns and lessons. This has helped ensure survival. This mechanism causes problems when the distinct pattern of a catchy song or the memory of a painful or embarrassing experience gets stuck in your brain like a leech in a place you can't reach. 

A memory is not like a digital video that remains the same no matter how many times you play it. Rather, until the original loses all meaning, context, and structure, rendering it inert if not deleted.

Process for deleting an unwanted brain/earworm:

* Replay the memory, changing details, pace, exaggerations, distortions. Make it funny, strange, surreal. 
* It is important to STRONGLY experience the distortions in your mind and and associate them directly with the memory.
* Do this repeatedly
* The beginning of the pattern is hardest to scramble. It is like the start of the path to the memory. When the original pattern is scrambled
* Avoid reminders or things that will re-establish original unwanted memory.


Example: You want to forget ""Call Me Maybe""

* Replay and change lyrics, context: ""Hey, I just m... ight eat a potato, or maybe a banana..."", ""Hey, I just aaaaaaaate a pooootaaato..."", ... ""Hey, I like liver
* Strongly experience means you have to sing or mouth the new songs. Sing as differently from the original pattern as possible.
* Enough repetitions will unhook that earworm.
* Now you might still have ""Hey""
* Avoid listening to the original song.

**EDIT:** 

How easy this is will vary based on the memory you choose to corrupt. A fresh memory of some faux pas or some recently-heard commercial jingle would be relatively easy to get rid of. Others are mental scars set deep in your long term memories that are near-impossible to wipe, and other memories. While it is hard to destroy something so deep, this technique WILL at least soften the impact and blur the harshness of the memory, with enough persistent repetition across long periods of time and upon each willing or spontaneous recall. Over time you can expect the memory to be more and more muddled.

* REPETITION is key. It's unreasonable to expect to erase a persistent brain pattern in under 4 reps. 10 reps recommended
* FOCUS is key. You must focus on EXPERIENCING EACH NEW DISTORTION so that your mind writes over the old pattern.
* DISTORTION is key. You must make each and every subsequent distortion weirder, you need to distort harder.
* This is a mind exercise. You only get stronger and more successful if you keep doing it. If you try once or not at all and then give up

I work front desk at a hotel and I can tell you that 75% of the 'issues' I have reported to me originate with 'Do Not Disturb' signs.

Alright so here's a bit more about what this is. This is not how to be homeless, or in a covered cause way. They are forced to sleep on cardboard pallets in abandoned buildings. This is fancy living compared to how most homeless have to/ forced to/ choose to live. Homelessness is a very complex issue and encompasses a very diverse group of people.
___________________________________________________________________________________


During your eviction hold a ""fire sale""


3 pairs of pants


3 shirts


7 pairs underwear

All of your socks

A blanket or sleeping bag

A backpack to put all of this in

After you have sold all of this stuff for whatever it will go for sight unseen

Now go to a different bank and open up an account

Now take your backpack and go to the nearest mission, a bed and a hot meal.
Now that you're in the shelter you must do this one thing. Treat everybody there as a human, it beats the hell out of cold concrete. I can attest to the frigidity of concrete and it'll humble a soul.

Now that you have a bed you need to ask where you can safely store your belongings

You'll probably have to go to some church service before dinner. Suck it up and do it

Ok so now it's chow time
Now it's shower time. This is probably going to suck unless you played sports in highschool or showered after gym. You'll be showering with your own gender. This is only as awkward as you make it. But just keep in mind somebody is going to see you naked. After the shower you may be offered socks. Take them! You may even be offered a laundry service. You need to figure out how this is run and who runs it. Get in good with this person so that you can get all of your clothes back when they've laundered them for you. This is important

Ok so now you're going to bed and you've been told the rules

You're going to wake up earlier than you usually do. Don't gripe. Make your bed. Go eat. Now go up front and see if you can get an I.D. card or inquire about how to save your bed for the night. You'll probably have to do some chore or such. Do them

Now that it's morning and you've done your chores. You're going to feel pretty childish. Well it is. Don't get used to it. You should now go out and look for employ. I used to hold a sign near Home Depot or Lowes saying Will Work For Peanuts with a little elephant on it. It worked and I learned many a trade. Usually through this I would befriend somebody who's couch I could sleep on. I did this while I was traveling. 

When I stopped traveling I ended up being roomates with a guy on the job site and we have been great friends ever since. Even though I now live in Chicago and he in Escondido we still talk on the phone.
Until somebody offers you a couch

I was homeless and traveling from age 18 to 23. I'm now 27 and going to school under the Pell Grant for Computer Science and have enough knowledge to build my own house. I wouldn't have any of this knowledge if I was not in your position when I was younger. I regret not going to college sooner but everybody has their cross to bear.

Cleaning, driving, etc. can all be productive if you just pop in an audiobook to accompany whatever you're doing. Personally I've been listening to audiobooks while streaming stocks.
It also works well playing games that don't require a lot of attention.

If you're mining linearly in block-building game- listen to an audiobook. Setting up your base in early stages of an RTS game- listen to an audiobook. Grinding for some RPG or MMORPG- listen to an audiobook.

The trouble of course, you can stretch it into far more meals than you could just going to McDonalds and dropping 3.50 on a one-serving nugget salad. You have to know where to shop for this to work. Albertsons/Vons/Whole Foods? Little too pricey. Ralphs/Fred Meyer? Closer to the target. What you're looking for is bottom of the food chain bulk/wholesale food, like WinCo/Smart And Final/ CostCo/BigLots, etc. 

Now, and a knife. You can even get away with just a microwave and a knife, but you have to be more creative about it. Now, eating well is super super easy, but nobody knows how to do it because nobody takes the time to learn. There are TONS of youtube channels out there that teach you how to cook, all you have to do is search for them. If you have a TV, watch the Food Network for a few days and you'll start picking things up. 

Anyway, I could get by on just that. 30 bucks of produce a week and ANYONE would be fine. You just have to know what to buy. First of all, never buy anything that's out of season if you can avoid it. Don't buy avocados unless you're in California (and even then, prices go way up out of season) or they're in season. If you buy avocados out of season, the quality will be lower and you'll be paying a substantial markup. ~~Buy those packages of romaine hearts (3.25) (3 per bag), a box of garlic croutons (1.50) and a container of caesar dressing (2.50). 3 (or more if you don't have a huge appetite) big, healthy meals for 7.25.~~ Buy a box of arugula or spinach, and even cheaper than the original caesar salad example which everyone hated.  You can stretch your money even further if you have a pressure cooker or crock pot. 6 dollars of vegetables (onion, throw into a crock pot for 7 hours and you'll have yourself an incredible stew that'll last you for at least 5 meals. 

I'm a broke college student myself, all it takes is some prep time and a little bit of motivation to learn how to cook basics. Steaming, boiling, frying and chopping. If you can do those things, you can eat really well for really cheap. Of course, I would be happy to answer any questions about how to budget and prepare food, because I had to learn all this by myself and want to share food with everyone. 

By request, and if you go to YouTube, you can learn how to cook it all. Finally, if you go to Amazon, you can buy a knife, a frying pan, and a stock pot and start eating healthier, and cheaper food.**

~~Edit: I don't know why something like this would get downvoted. It's bizarre to me that there are people that are so fast-food centric that they'd be aversive to better health and saving money and gaining a practical life skill. I'm not even upset

Edit 2: Eggs are cheap. If you know how to fry an egg

Edit 3: Avocado clarification: Avoid buying avocados when they're off-season. Any way you slice it, you're going to pay less for avocados. Even less if it's during the summer. The general point to this edit is to pay attention to seasonal/regional things. If you can get them from nearby and they're in season, you'll pay a TON less. Avoid out of season produce. 

Edit 4: As flohammed_albroseph pointed out, if you buy in bulk, you can get pasta on the cheap. It lasts forever, too. 

Edit 5: As is being pointed out in the comments, comparatively) healthier way, a caesar isn't a bad choice-- however, it's worth mentioning that there are easier and healthier salads out there which can't be ignored. When in doubt, grilled (or baked, or pan fried, or anything as long as it's cooked) chicken, romaine lettuce

Edit 6: For those just showing up to the party, as well as having high quality discussion in general. 

Edit 7: Let's talk meat. Now, if you don't buy it prepackaged in the meat aisle at your favorite market, you can save some money by visiting a butcher. If you don't have a butcher in your town, the deli counter in a market can still save you some money. Boneless chicken breasts are actually the best choice here. They're the most versatile of any meat when trying to eat healthy and cheap. Sausage (bratwurst and such) is a close second, and the stuff is pretty filling. Cuts of fish like Mahi Mahi and Salmon can fluctuate wildly, so keep your eye on the prices as you shop. If you come in next time and see that it's a buck less per pound, it's time to stock up.

**Here are a few ways you can make your coffee taste better:**

*Before brewing:*

Add stuff! A pinch of salt will take some of the bitterness out of your coffee and make it taste a bit more smooth

**Quantity:** 4 tablespoons for every 3 cups of coffee. Or get a coffee scoop and it will be two scoops to every three cups. This brews coffee that is a bit dark, add water to taste. This way you can have lighter coffee with a better flavor.


Lastly

**Freshness:** How old is the coffee, you might think about buying whole bean coffee and grinding before you brew.

**Water:** Tap water will, but may or may not be worth the hassle to you. Using tap water also has more calcium build up over time and will mean that you have to clean your coffee maker more frequently.

**Grind:** How finely or coarsely ground your coffee is *will* affect the flavor, a finer grind will result in darker coffee. Don't overdo it with this, it's easy to brew something undrinkable if you get the grind too far from what it should be, and coffee that s too finely ground will be very bitter.

**Proportion:** We already covered this. If you brew the right amount of grounds to water

**Edit: French Presses:**

So you really like coffee

French presses are great because they:

* Are easy to use

* Easy to clean

* And make better coffee.

If you are just getting started, but using the same grind for both won't impact the flavor too badly), and a way to get *water* almost to boiling temperature (200 degrees F is ideal).

You put the grounds in the french press with the lid/plunger removed, and once the plunger is all the way down, you are ready to pour yourself a cup.

When adding the water
**Don't use boiling water** or you will scorch the grounds, and this will yield better results for your effort.*

You will need a:

-Fitted Sheet

-Flat Sheet

-Comforter

-Decorative Sheet

-2-4+ Pillows

-1 Decorative Pillow

-Bed Skirt (Optional)


1. Start with FRESH linens! http://i.imgur.com/dyapWiel.jpg

2. Throw your fitted sheet over the mattress. Doing diagonal corners first helps even it out and look smooth. Put the flat sheet over it and put it to the top of the bed. Put the comforter on over that

Make sure there is enough room at the foot of the bed for the comforter to fold under the mattress. 

3. Lay the decorative sheet over the other sheets

4. Next take your flat sheet and fold it over the comforter: http://i.imgur.com/oSLz7jKl.jpg
 
5. Do the same thing to the comforter over the fold of the decorative sheet: http://i.imgur.com/sRV59Cnl.jpg 

6. Wrap the decorative sheet around the comforter and tuck under. This makes that nice looking design: http://i.imgur.com/sHU8lexl.jpg

7. At the bottom of the bed

And fold it under so that it hangs over the bottom of the bed: http://i.imgur.com/UIHUWjKl.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/plaSiupl.jpg

And repeat on the other side

8. Take the decorative sheet and pull the opposite direction as you did the comforter: http://i.imgur.com/CBbyRTSl.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/GumcmeXl.jpg (Sorry, so that the side of the bed has a nice flat corner to it. Here is what it should look like: http://i.imgur.com/4uUSFail.jpg

9. Take your stripped pillows and put on fresh pillow sheets: http://i.imgur.com/egKl181l.jpg

10. Lay them on the bed

Now here are a few tips on your next hotel stay

-We ALWAYS clean the rooms, every single surface of your room has been sanitized. We even go on our hands and knees to manually wash the bathroom floors. You wouldn't believe how much people shed. Sorry if we miss a hair. 

-If you feel skeptical on your room being cleaned

-At the Courtyard Marriot we only refresh your sheets if you're staying for more than one day if you ask

-Last but not least, and luckily for me, I love it. We rarely get tipped, but when we do it makes our entire day better knowing that people care about us as much as we care about you!

It works best on children but I have used it on grown ups as well. That being said I still use it all the time since it can be so effective. Hopefully some one out there can use it to cheer some one up.

First you need a some one who is grumpy (they don't *have* to be grumpy but it makes it easier). Tell the person that if they don't cheer up you will use a Jedi Mind Trick on them. You will typically get a response along the lines of ""there is no such thing"" or ""that's stupid"". This attitude is actually helpful for the trick to work.

Then

In my experience they will crack a smile in under 10 seconds even if they don't want to. Once they start to smile they will giggle a bit because your Jedi Mind trick was effective even though they thought it was a waste of time.

Once they smile for a couple of seconds their mood will lighten a bit.

 This trick works best on younger kids but I do it to my wife when she is feeling grouchy and it still works every time. Also

To be clear

Use your new found powers wisely.

Other tips:

1. **For some cool drinking water at the start of your trip**

2. **Make sure you pre-chill all the food** before you put it in the cooler. If your food can be frozen without affecting the quality (milk, etc.) and you won't need it right away, freeze it. You can freeze juice boxes. Don't freeze canned beverages or foods.

3. If you have a large chest freezer with enough room, then load it up.

4. **Pack related items together inside a large ziplock bag**, and the food will stay drier. Throw in a few extra bags to store leftovers. Foods that come in a ""resealable"" package will probably not stay dry if they get submerged in meltwater once they've been opened; put them in a ziplock bag.

5. **Keep your cooler out of the sun, towel, or reflective emergency blanket. (If you're camping, don't leave your cooler in your tent or outside. Hungry animals and/or people will show up.)

6. **Keep a thermometer in your cooler.** Your food should stay below the ""[danger zone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger_zone_\(food_safety\))"" temperature of 5°C / 41°F. Foods that are potentially hazardous if they spend two or more hours in the danger zone are: meat, eggs, protein rich foods, dairy products, cut or peeled fresh produce, most cooked foods, shellfish, sprouts

7. If you need your cooler to stay cold longer

8. Plastic **egg carrier cases** work well, pre-mix them and put them in a tight-sealing container or wide-mouth bottle.

Even though you have a giant deductible

For example, and the only thing the hospital could bill me for.  

So in short, and as long as you go to an ""in network"" provider, they have to honor those discounts. And as a plus, if you do have a catastrophic illness, you will meet your giant deductible pretty quickly and then have the insurance kick in.

*edit*
You also benefit from having access to the insurance company ""rules"" that doctors have to follow. For example, the blood draw fee is considered ""incidental"", meaning, its included in the cost of doing the  blood test, so the blood draw fee gets denied, and they cannot bill you for that.

The reason is because when you cook a pizza, the water goes into the cuts and the crust absorbs the water making the toppings slide when you take a slice. If you wait until the pizza is at home and in one piece, the water has time to evaporate. Now when you cut it, there is no water and the toppings stay put and everything tastes better because it's not watered down.

Been doing this for years and will never go back.

1344000487.0,xm9rg,LTP: Back to School,,3092,1577,696,"I went to college for an entire decade to get a doctorate and I am now a college professor at a major university. I feel I have learned a few things about being in and around university life. Here are my best tips. Feel free to add your own.

**Class schedule:**

One of the most important things needed in order to be successful in college life is to have your schedule set in the way that will be most beneficial to your lifestyle. Have trouble getting up in the mornings? DO NOT schedule an 8:00 am class; don't fool yourself into thinking that you will start getting up this semester. The reason universities offer classes at varying times is to allow students with different lifestyles to be successful. Sometimes

Look up where your classes are. Make sure that you have time in between classes to travel

Schedule in time to workout, and personal time. This is often neglected. Once you get busy, all the things that you plan on doing ""when I have time"" will not happen. Put them in your planner/calendar.

Diligently use the calendar app on your phone/iPod/tablet/computer or buy a calendar book. Write down your classes and assignments. Write down social engagements as well. You may have been able to remember everything in high school

**Food**

If you are living in dorms and eating dorm food, fruit, and a yogurt for breakfast instead of waiting in the hot food line and getting sausage, bacon, pancakes, etc every morning.

If you live off campus and will be buying your own groceries: make sure to make regular trips to the grocery store. Don't be caught without food, make a sandwich and take it with you. This isn't as exciting as getting food out, but you will save hundreds of dollars a year with just a little planning.

**Parking**

Parking on campus can be very

**Bathrooms**

Every campus has good bathrooms and bad bathrooms. The bad bathrooms are usually in the dorms and close to class rooms. The good bathrooms are by administrative offices and offices that bring in lots of guests

Carry a little toilet paper or wipes with you. Not all toilet paper is created equally. Campus toilet paper is some of the worst TP on the planet. I'm not even sure how it qualifies as TP.

**Quarters**

Quarters are one of the most prized commodities in university life. You'll need them for laundry, photocopies, and playing quarters (do people still play quarters?!)

**Try New Things**

The first couple weeks of college are very exciting - you meet new people, dance performance, or play (these are often free on campus; go to the theater on campus (if there is one) and see an art film; go to a sporting event of a sport you don't normally watch. Try new things all the time. You may be surprised with what you enjoy.

**Professors**

Professors are generally intelligent people. Don't try to bullshit them. Be honest. Instead of fabricating some story about why you missed a test

Get to know your professors. Visit them during office hours if you need help. You may feel like you don't want to bother them

Get to know your professors

**Roommates**

Communicate about schedules before school starts. There is nothing worse that waking up for the first day of classes and have someone be in the shower when you need it. Try to have a good idea of their schedule so that you don't step on each other's toes.

Clean up after yourself. Most roommate trouble starts with dishes left around the apartment or in the sink. Take a few seconds to clean up after yourself; it goes a long way.

Do something unexpected for your roommates once a month. Cook them a meal

**Common Campus Courtesies**

Take off your headphones when people are talking to you.

Open a door for someone.

Keep your head up and smile at those around you. Too many students walk around with their head pointed at the ground.

Please

Help someone that needs help in a class.

Help someone that is handicapped - open a door

Throw your garbage in the garbage can and recycle when possible. It's your campus and your home for the next several years.

These are just a few thoughts. Please leave your own in the comments. Good luck going back to school!

**EDIT:**

**Textbooks**

DO NOT buy textbooks at the university bookstore if possible. Try the local competitor or Amazon. 

Take classes with a roommate and split the cost of a book.

Check to see if the library has your text. I found this out my junior year of undergrad. The library had a copy of every class I took. I was the first to check the book out (a week or two before classes) and kept renewing the book throughout the semester.

**EDIT 2:**

I know I got the acronym wrong. Thanks to the eighty people that pointed it out.

**EDIT 3**

Forgot a big one. Change your sheets every week. If you are expecting ""company

**EDIT 4**

Several responses have been along the line of ""LPT: Don't go to college."" I think we can be more accepting than that. May I propose a new method of thinking when it comes to education?

Get the education you need for the career you want.

If this means medical school, grad school it is. Have the courage to try to live your dream. College/university isn't for everyone, but for those with specific goals in mind (that would be benefitted by a college degree), go to school and work hard.

Thanks all for making this a highly visible tip. My message as a first responder (firefighter): If you're not first aid trained, doesn't take long (a weekend at most) and gives you the skills to save lives. Emergencies happen without warning, I know from experience. Knowing what to do and how to delegate tasks during an emergency will dramatically improve the victims chances of survival. 

**Get trained. Do not put it off. You do not want to regret putting off your first aid course if a friend or a loved one needs your skills and focus.**

Regarding liability: **check your local laws** as this varies by state and country. Almost all jurisdictions have 'good will' or 'good samaritan' legislation that waives liability for assistance rendered in an emergency. If in doubt: **always call an ambulance/render assistance if able**.

Orangered me more trainers if you know of any.

--------------------------------------------

Seems strange

Play the song in your head

One other thing: **press hard**

Effective compressions are 1/3rd of the way into an adult victims chest. Don't be afraid to break bones. A few cracked ribs are a much better alternative to death.

Keep calm and keep compressing until paramedics take over.

So, bakery, produce) so that is where my example is going to come from. 

Store brand items are rarely made by 'cheaper' companies in grocery chains.  Usually a large brand will repackage the store brand item so they can get more items and facings in the store and preferential treatment from corporate buyers when selling new items (or even discounted/waved slotting fees

OK

Lets say I'm having a cookout and need to buy bratwurst but the high quality Johnsonville Brats are 2 dollars more expensive per pack than the store brand and I need to keep prices low but keep the quality of my meats for the BBQ high (so my friends don't think I'm a cheap ass... but the PBR might give that away...).

[Here is a picture of a package of Johnsonville Brats](http://i.imgur.com/phH8p.jpg) Do you see the small circle above ""Previously handled frozen for your protection

Even the biggest names only have handful of places that will package their product and (usually) only one that will handle the grocery chains in your region.  That location will also handle/package the store brand items.  

SO, but it will save you money if you are looking for quality along with low prices.

**edit** Someone in [/r/frugal](/r/frugal) said this was like excessive coupon cutting, you can buy store brand instead and enjoy the same quality.

1350354695.0,11jrqa,LPT: How to avoid being d0xed,BeCarefulFolks,2204,812,369,"**Alternate title: how to keep your real identity private online.**

As [requested](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/11j1o6/violentacrez_comes_back_from_the_dead_as_mbrutsh/c6mx7yi), but other users of NSFW subreddits, and SRS, have also been d0xed in the last 72 hours, even though that hasn't been widely publicized.  I mostly lurk on this site, but I see this recent d0xing trend as a major problem.  I hope the comments on this post deal mostly with how to harden one's online profile, instead of degenerating into ""who's right"" in any of the recent dramafests.

As a first point, time, and interest can always document your personal identifying information (known as d0xing in hacker slang).  So, for example, I think it is safe to assume that the NSA can connect any username I've ever used on any site to my real identity.  They may not have bothered to do it yet, because I doubt I'm a person of interest to them, but they likely have all the data stored to connect the dots if they needed to.

Most users of this site aren't political activists though.  They are people who would probably prefer that their employers/parents/church not know about their requests for relationship advice, but a nosy fellow Redditor won't.

General Tips:

1. **Google every username you've ever used.**  (Also use Bing, etc.  I'll just say Google from now on.)  This includes handles on message boards, IM, and dating sites.  Close or make private all profiles that come up, so an attacker cannot cross-reference from site to site to get more information about you.

2. Delete your MySpace, invite people directly.  Don't allow your identifying information to be visible to friends (or at least premium members).  [LinkedIn is a hacker's dream tool](http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/12/technology/linkedin-hackers/index.htm).  The same is true about Facebook.

3. Use multiple online usernames, use one username to create and moderate subreddits, another to surf NSFW content, and another to post in the default subs.  Also, it's best to scrub your content history regularly, and/or to throw away old usernames and start anew on a regular schedule, such as the first of every month.  These usernames should not be obviously connected to one another (""name001"" and ""name 002"" would not be a good choice).  You can always PM your friends saying that you're using the new name, I recommend installing a [password manager](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0

4. [Remove your personal information](http://www.howtovanish.com/2011/02/remove-personal-information-from-the-internet/) from the major search engines and databases.  There are a lot more than Google

Good luck

I would like to tell you about a way that can increase your happiness
For a long time
However

The tools i used for this was a pen and a block of paper.
Every night, and i write down the good things that have happened to me during the day.
I have started writing down even the smallest event

An example: 
2. March 2013
- Played the guitar again
- Had a pizza with my good friend
- Had a good talk with mom on the phone

You can put down as many things on the list as you'd like.
However there might be days where you feel unhappy
Whenever this happens
By every day there will be more added to the list
Be careful that it doesnt just turn into a diary. Write only the things that made you feel happy and good about yourself.

I have been doing this for 3 months now

So I came up with the solution. I thought, I had removed the skin on every finger up to the mid-joint. (It was vile) I replaced it daily, wore gloves when I could.  Once you remove the ability to bite, you remove the habit. I stopped. But I wasn't convinced, so I began to remove the tape finger by finger over the course of a few weeks. I didn't bite them. For the first time in 19 years I could cut my nails. The Whole process took about a few months, then a few weeks for the unravelling. I couldn't tell if my parents were happy or sad. I'd done something they'd been trying to do for years, and now they had to fork over £200 for a ticket. I was extremely grateful
So that's it really. Get yourself some motivation and some tape. 

EDIT: well this has taken off

-Hypnotherapy    I was about to have this done, so this would be a last resort. 

-Rubber band technique-   Another gentleman (JC_BOOM_) turned himself into the pavlovs dog of the biting world,but putting the band on seems to be the trick.

-getting your friends/family/co-workers to kick your ass into submision-  I tired this

-meth- juhesihcaaa has stated that a woman in a gas station told her she stopped after she took meth. Every      little helps I guess. (I'm not actually condoning drug use)

-Chew something else- keep yourself occupied, cats teeth. Whatever takes your fancy. it keeps your mouth occupied. 

TL;DR
Get tape. Tape yourself. Unravel slowly. A few months. Stop. Be a badass.

Alright here it is people. I'm a cop. I think that tickets have turned into a way, look away. Cover your face. Do whatever you can to make your face unrecognizable to the camera. The burden is on the court to prove that it is you. When you get the ticket (and you will) just state that there is not sufficient evidence to prove that it is you in the vehicle. (if your face is covered/blurred there is not) they will ask you who was in the vehicle. You do not have to tell them. The burden is on the court to prove your guilt, not for you to prove your innocence. Also another handy way is if your. Married and you and your spouse drive different cars, register the opposite spouse's name to each car. They issue the ticket to the registered owner. If your married and your spouse is the registered owner of the car you normally drive, you can just say that you are clearly not the registered owner and get out of it that way also.

If anyone has any other questions on how to get out of petty things like traffic tickets..let me know ill try to help

I always get annoyed when the pen stops writing, but it won't write. The ink simply won't come out. 

**LPT:** *put a piece of paper underneath your hand, it transfers some of the natural grease and minerals, which cover our skin. The ball inside of the pen simply starts to slide on top of that grease, not revolving, thus not getting more ink out. 

This isn't based on any research or anything. This is just my observation from college years. 

**TL;DR:** put a piece of paper under your writing hand to make sure that the hand does not come into contact with the paper you're writing on. The paper is less filthy and prevents pen sliding.

1321444656.0,meaq9,The REAL quick fix to get your fucked up sleep schedule back on track,Software_Engineer,1859,598,207,"Look below for the quick fix

I say ""real"" because I first want to warn you about a quick fix technique that does NOT work.

The ""wrap around"" technique is where you stay up all night until

This doesn't work. If you stay up all night you get ""sleep debt"" and you  will end up requiring more sleep in the following days to pay back your sleep debt. Sleep debt is a real phenomenon that has been discussed in academic journals. FYI If you oversleep one night you cannot expect to be able to sleep less the next night. There are no rollover hours. But if you don't get enough sleep one night you WILL have to repay those hours over the course of the following nights. This is why the wrap around technique is a myth. I have tried it over 10 times and failed over 10 times.  

**HERE IS THE QUICK FIX**

Stop eating. Right now. *Fast* until the time when you want to wake up

At 7am go to a window where you can see the sun and look at it (not directly! but get the sun in your field of vision). Then eat a complete

You can survive 3 weeks without eating so it won't do you any permanent damage to fast until 7am.

Your circadian rhythm is mostly affected by two things:

1.) Sunlight

2.) Meal timings

Even ancient roman philosophers (I'm thinking of Epictetus the Stoic) said that one must first control his eating habits

I have found it relatively easy to force myself to eat once at 7am

Also consider if you are getting enough exercise.


**TL;DR** Don't try to stay up all night. Stop eating right now and fast until your target wake-up time. Eat a large healthy breakfast and get some sunlight in your retina at that time. Repeat until sleep schedule has been fixed

*****

**EDIT** I read the comments and I would like to add some of the things that helpful redditors have mentioned.

Yes

It's winter time so the sun rises late. Daylight savings times helps this however. If you still must rise before the sun consider buying a sun lamp.

Specifically BLUE light is what wakes you up. But any bright light source will stimulate your circadian cycle.

This technique is less effective if you body is used to sporadic meal times.

This technique is consistent with the old adage ""Eat breakfast like a king

Redditor ""ejactulator"" claims to be a physician and PhD student and vouches for this technique. He says he does it when he travels around the world to avoid jet lag. That is also how I learned of this technique. Instead of using it to cure jetlag

Avoid using the internet or watching tv in the hour or two before you go to bed. Find another activity to do during that time that does not require looking at a bright screen.

Consider Melatonin supplements but they are not for everyone. If you suspect your body might not react well then talk to your doctor first.

Be warned that fasting slows down your metabolism and while I say above it will not cause you permanent damage

*I have made edits based on popular suggestions!*

* First of all

* Organize your sources. If you are given a list of sources you can use, then you can use it. (That was what I meant by textbook).

* When you write

* ~~Use your lectures as a source! Professors and the TAs that will most likely be grading the essay like seeing that you paid attention in class.~~ Only do this if the professor asks for it or you know it will be fine.

* If you cannot use your textbook, this works for history papers. Can't use your *A History of the Roman People* textbook for the paper? Then use *History of Rome*.

* Do not waste time on footnotes when you are writing your essay. Instead, go back and do your footnotes. Obviously, if you are using another author with the same last initial, make sure the include the first initial so you do not get confused and misattribute a quote. While trying to figure out the footnotes in Word, you can lose your momentum or a great idea.

* As for the dreaded length requirements: learn to be eloquent. I like to write fantasy stories, do not quote entire paragraphs from your sources word for word. This makes it too obvious that you are doing your paper last minute. Instead, summarize what you read in your own words and then put in your citation after you have completed summarizing. This is the easiest way to gain length, since a research essay is just a collection of sources regurgitated into a coherent paper.

* Lastly, and wars. While I love studying Roman warfare, it is a broad topic that is often confusing. Instead, I went with religion and culture. Why? The information is straightforward and easy to find. The aforementioned book *A History of the Roman People* has chapters dedicated to those subjects divided from the rest of the information, making it incredibly easy to find.",,False,t5_2s5oq,True

As stated I am a professional mechanic and I see at least once a week a car come in with damage caused by a plastic grocery bag. Most people are completely unaware they hit the bag or that it was causing problems. 

Here is a list of problems plastic bags can cause. 


* Getting sucked into the drive belts and wrapping themselves around alternators, etc. When they do this it can cause anything they are wrapped around to fail, leading to expensive repairs, and even a risk of fire. 


* Getting wrapped around half axles and destroying the axle boot and leading to axle failure. This is really common


* Getting stuck to the exhaust system components and melting, and then burn up the wiring on the O2 sensor. That resulted in a check engine light, and a costly repair for the vehicle owner. 


* Getting sucked into the torque converter


This is just a quick short list. There are many more issues these bags can cause. And often its not cheap to repair and can lead to dangerous situations for the vehicle owners.

*My opinions and responses to several comments*

ok, but not every region of the world is going to feel that same way. Even here, there are plenty of people that won't/can't buy a firearm, that do have access to a vehicle.

While I think that a gun can provide a good sense of security, that shouldn't own a firearm.  You had be very damn sure that you want someone dead before you start pointing guns at them. 

Setting off a car alarm won't accidentally kill your neighbor, or your kids sneaking back into the house.

I also agree that a home alarm system would be a better solution, but this used to be a requirement), or just plain not allowed. 

The people that say your neighbors are going to hate you if you do this... No they're not. If you're not an idiot, I hate to break it to you, but your neighbors probably already hate you.

**How it works**

We all know our skin produces natural oils. These oils hydrate and protect your skin. OCM works by daily replacing dirty oil with clean oil


**How to**


To make your oil cleanser you will need 3 things: Coconut oil


Start with this ratio: 90% coconut oil


Every night before bed, however!), and gently wipe your face clean. Dry, and you're all done! 


*only wash your face a maximum of one time per day!* that's all your skin needs. In the morning


After a few days, if your skin feels too oily, increase castor oil and decrease coconut oil. Be very careful with the amount of castor oil you are using though, as it can severely dry out your skin.



**Results** 


For the first few days, but this is ok! The oil is acting as a moisturizer. After you wake up the next morning, your face should not feel oily any more.


I saw improvements in my skin after just the first day


I hope this helps some of you out there struggling with acne!


Good luck!



**EDIT**

As has been pointed out, but others may find it does not work for their skin.


There are several other base oils that you can use in place of coconut oil, and Sweet Almond are among the highest recommended.


I do recommend starting with a lower castor oil ratio because too much castor oil can severely dry out your skin

1. Shut up and listen. Sometimes people will start talking and something will come up that is a common interest. Even if someone just mentions for example the word car

2. Express an interesting thought from a movie, etc... Doesn't have to be on-topic, if the conversation is dying, anything goes! Last time I did that, I was talking about the movie Man of Steel and how the people of Krypton reproduced. Turned out the guy I was talking to teaches religion and obviously that was quite a conversation sparker.

3. If you frequently don't know what to say to people at, go through your list, pick an item and start talking about it. So what if it's a bit awkward that a conversation just started and you're already looking at your phone, they'll forget about that in 5 seconds as soon as the conversation is back up and running again. This one has saved me many times!

4. Little bit the same as 3

5. Don't start or continue conversations with negative thoughts. When someone tells you he/she likes film photography, for example ""What drew you to film photography?"". Remember: what the heart is filled with, the mouth is full of. A simple follow-up question can release a torrent of information which you can use in applying the other tips.

6. Share your experience on something you just did or are about to do. I told someone I was going to music school
7. Remember what people are or were talking about so you can always go back to that topic. Yes

5 – Cut the Side of the Can

Position the can so that the leftover piece of metal used to keep the base attached is opposite the location you intend to make a vertical incision in the can. Use the scissors to cut a straight line from the bottom of the can to the top. Then open the can up to create a shape similar to a satellite dish. If the can is still wet at the point

6 – Attaching the Can to Your Router

The problem is that I just can't turn my brain off, whirling, whirling away. I'll even try consciously not to think consciously. You can image how well that works. It's futile, so I have to get up and do something else.

However, while the sneaky science elves fight a rear-guard action to put you to sleep.

**1. Read a book in bed with a Red LED Headlamp**

Only a book though, a kindle or e-reader without a backlight will work, but never use a phone or computer, these shine bright bluish-white LED light in your face, no matter what colour is on the screen. **Blue Light is stimulating to the brain, and will keep you awake; avoid at all costs!** This won't work with a computer screen, a white (aka blue) LED head-lamp

Before I picked up a cheap-o $20 princeton-tec red headlamp, especially if the book was captivating. Go for the red, read for a bit, you'll be shocked at how little you can read before the book hits you in the face. When you read with a Red head-lamp, your brain is snuggled down and sedated. It's better than nyquil.

--

**2. Audiobooks = Bedtime Story = Zzzzzzzzzzzzz**

The other trick that works every time at shutting my brain off is to listen to an audiobook or lecture series (like the amazing TTC ones that you can find at your local library, go for a spoken story/lecture.

I keep one of my earbuds in one ear and put my other ear on my pillow and before I get 10 minutes in, but before long, I'm conked right out.

If you spot a dying bee (or bumble bee)

* don't be afraid of bees - just stay calm
* bring it into a dry place (just put in on a table or whatever)
* take a cup and mix sugar (*not* artificial or diet sweetener or other crap
* take a spoon and make the sugar ''dissolve''
* put a spoon of your sugar water on a dish and place the bee (use a paper to scoop it up) right next to it (*not* into it)
* observe the bee drink it and make sure that it doesn't end stuck in it (again
* open a window and turn off bright lights

And then wait. In my experience, wait a moment and suddenly start flying again. If your window is open, odds are high that it will find it and directly fly out.

Younger I lived in the countryside and had to deal with plenty of bees. I never really thought about helping the dying ones, every other day I will find such a dying bee and I found out that this method works perfectly.

**END UPDATE**

Hey guys

I'm uninsured, then put the card's info under my account without asking me ANYTHING about it, and that same prescription cost **$9**. 

The card saves you a different price, what dosage you're getting, etc. I say estimate, because when I went to Target, the price from the website was off by about 50 cent or so. 

Anyway, and give them to your friends, family, homeless people, whoever you think needs help with their prescription. I'm about to put in an order myself for a bunch. 

If you're interested in seeing how much your prescription would cost with the card

**WARNING-** This site takes a long time to load. I fear that if it recieves a lot of attention, in PDF form- 

~~[**HUMAN** card](https://www.dropbox.com/s/90pxpk67sod9wt0/CAP%20HUMAN%20Drug%20Plan%20Card.pdf)~~

~~[**PET** card](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zf19nhqe7cjg6li/CAP%20PET%20Drug%20Plan%20Card.pdf)~~

**IN FACT**

Oh, is to get larger tablets and split them in half. My therapist knows I'm short on cash, and I have this one med called Deplin that is goddamn $50 a month. Well, the price is the same for both the 7.5mg and the 15mg. I'm supposed to take the 7.5mg, so she prescribes me the 15mg, I cut them in half and I'm able to save $25 a month that way. 

Your doctor may not be so understanding. Some doctors are assholes! Some meds are controlled substances, ask your doc about it, see what they think, and you might be able to save some money! 

**TL;DR** Print these cards out for ~~[**HUMAN**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/90pxpk67sod9wt0/CAP%20HUMAN%20Drug%20Plan%20Card.pdf)~~ and ~~[**PET**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zf19nhqe7cjg6li/CAP%20PET%20Drug%20Plan%20Card.pdf)~~ prescriptions. Save money. Ask your doc about getting a double dose tablet and splitting it in half- same cost for the pill

**Links to the site PLEASE DON'T CRASH THEM ;_;**

Actual site- ~~http://www.caprxprogram.org/Home.aspx~~

Check the price of your prescriptions

Okay, I don't know. Just tryin' to help out my fellow broke ass homies. 

**EDIT-** User david-saint-hubbins linked Target's $4 [generic prescription program](http://www.target.com/pharmacy/generics-condition). I'm on 10mg Citalopram, and splitting the tablet, I'll be able to get a two month supply for $4! 

Also, sorry.

So I've created two categories: 

Helping you

And helping us. 

Firstly helping you: 

You can order a filet a la cart

Free mayo packets

If you order a happy meal

You can request fresh hot fries

You can ask for two apple packets

If you ask for extra sauce at the second window we won't charge. 

This works at some McDonald's: if you say only *whatever you want that would normally cost extra money* it won't charge for it 
Ex: McDouble with only Mac sauce = 1.00 McDouble with added macsauce=1.30 

Our small fries are now 1.25 and our medium is 1.56.... Perhaps upgrade to the medium?

One pie costs $1 two cost 1.25.

One cookie costs .75 three cost $1.00.

There are such a thing as McDouble meals and mcchicken meals. If you order things as meals it saves you some money instead of ordering everything separately (the only exception is if you order a number 4 with no cheese just order two hamburgers a medium fry and your drink.) 

Do not i repeat do not eat the mcribs
http://i.imgur.com/H1cFg.jpg &lt;that's why 

If you come during rush hours our food will be fresher but if you come during non rush hours it will be faster on average dinner hours are from 4:40-7. 

Helping us:

I have no problem giving you a few moments to think

Don't order additional food at the second window (go ahead and order it at the first.)

Get your money out quickly I get yelled at for that too. 

I'm not telling you not to order ice cream or speciality drinks but

On average drive through times are anywhere from 90-120 seconds (meaning from the time I take your order till the time you get your food it takes 90-120 seconds) they can vary but that's average. That means if you're running late

Lastly: do not pick change up in the drive through I'm supposed to yell at you for that because when you take that change my drawer comes up short but its just too awkward not to mention you hold everyone up for 70some cents and this is immensely frustrating.

I was completely sober and not in possession of any illegal drugs or weapons. 

 I was not acting any more or less nervous than I imagine most people might be while being pulled over and then harassed for nothing. When the officer TOLD me he was going to search me and my car because of my ""strange and nervous behavior"" I told him I did not consent to the search. At this time his supervisor approached us and told me I should ""shut the fuck up"" unless I wanted to go to jail. The officer who pulled me over then searched my car and the pockets of my shorts.

Long story short, the officer told me he would delete the police report and video recorded from inside the car then dropped me back off in a parking lot near my job and let me go. 

After watching a video on YouTube titled ""Police officer gets owned by law student"" (where a gentleman who has had his legal gun illegally taken by a police officer then very matter-of-factly asserts his knowledge of his rights and the law to quite righteous avail) I thought that compiling an  ""I-know-my-rights cheat sheet, and any other pertinent information to learn and/or reference if I find myself in a similar situation MIGHT help.

1362589401.0,19s87w,LPT: How to CORRECT your posture after your back has already hunched,Ribeye_n_WaffleFries,1190,295,86,"By Xiao

Here's an awesome and simple protip for you that I've learned from experience. Yesterday there was a request for tips to Improve your posture

You can correct a minor hunchback over time by lying on your stomach whenever you read a book or use a laptop!

1) Place a cushion under your stomach. This is optional

2) Keep your neck straight and focus most of your spine's bending on where it is hunched.



*Q: ""My neck hurts from reading like this. Am I doing something wrong?""*

*A: Yes

*Don't bend your lower back either, focus most of your spine's bending on where it is hunched.*



It should correct your hunch over the course of several months depending on how often you work in this position. I've done this and now my posture is good. I've used an elastic back brace before I discovered this method; this method works much better. 

You do not need a chiropractor for minor hunchbacks.

1.  STAY HYDRATED.  Even if you're not thirsty drink water, the reason it doesn't feel hot is because your body is efficiently cooling you by evaporating your fluids very quickly.  Humidity affects evaporation and how hot you feel.  

2. PROTECT YOUR SKIN.  Not only by using sunscreen but by covering up.  Wear loose fitting clothing that minimizes skin exposure.  Tighter clothes and a large skin area will facilitate rapid fluid loss.  At 115°F with minimal skin protection you can expect to loose close to 1.5L of water per hour.

Their ETF -- whilst ridiculous given you're still staying with Verizon -- is applicable if you downgrade out of one of their bundles.

I'd done some research locally, competing internet/cable providers would help with other companies' ETFs, too.  Ask around.

So if you're looking to cut the cord and go purely FiOS internet and want to get the ETF waived completely:

* Inform the CSR that you intend to downgrade to just their internet package and cancel TV.  They're likely to want to transfer you to their retention department

* The CSR will likely inform you that as you're canceling a bundle, read on, and stay firm**

* Tell the CSR that the other provider has offered to cover the cost of your ETF and that you're willing to switch providers if Verizon cannot waive the ETF.

At this point it's important to bring up some important numbers to the CSR:

* If they do not waive the ETF, they lose that pricing power completely.

* If they do waive the ETF, so over 2 years that's $2,040.

Trust me

The CSR I spoke to didn't have the authority to waive the fee (none of them do)

I did this today

So not only am I going to save $17 a month by not having to pay for the HD DVR

Total saving over the 24 months = $444 and no ETF. 

It is very important that you remain calm, happy, and professional = getting exactly what you want.

Customer wins.

p.s. Roku is really awesome.

p.p.s. yeah I realize I essentially wrote Fee Fee

Statements like these are rarely true (there aren't many people who have never turned off a light!) and as a result they tend to get people on the defensive.

It's much better to say ""Could you please try not to leave the light on"" or ""I would appreciate it if you would unload the dishwasher more often"" or something to that effect. When phrased like this no one feels like they're being unfairly accused and your point is still made. They also can't refute your point on the grounds of it being untrue.

On the other hand they can be great if used in a positive way e.g. ""you always look amazing!"" or ""You never fail to cheer me up""

**Edit:** it's been pointed out that the counter example's I used may be considered passive aggressive (perhaps there's too much British charm in there - my bad). That's not the idea I was going for and I apologies if that's what you got from it. By all means be direct just avoid ""you always/never"".

First of all

- Diphenhydramine 

There are two common variations of diphenhydramine on the market:

- Diphenhydramine hydrochloride (abbreviated HCl) [9 out of 10 times
- Diphenhydramine citrate [this is rarer

Now let's look at some brand names, and prices:

- Benadryl (Allergy medicine) (~$6.50 for 24 tablets) (one tablet contains 25 mg of diphendyramine HCl)

- Tylenol PM (Pain reliever/sleep aid) (~6.50 for 36 pills) (one pill contains Tylenol and 25 mg of diphenhydramine HCl)

- Advil PM (Pain reliever/sleep aid) (~8.00 for 40 pills) (one pill contains Advil and 38 mg of diphenhydramine citrate)

- Advil PM Liqui-Gels (Pain reliever/sleep aid) (~9.00 for 32 capsules) (one pill contains Advil and 25 mg of diphenhydramine HCl)

- ZZZQuil (Sleep aid) (~7.00 for one bottle) (one teaspoon contains 25 mg of diphenhydramine HCl)

- Generic Dollar Store allergy medicine (allergy medicine) (1.00 for 36 pills) (one pill contains 25 mg of diphenhydramine HCl)

- Generic Dollar Store Tylenol PM (Pain relief/sleep aid) (1.00 for 24 pills) (one pill contains Tylenol and 25 mg of diphenhydramine HCl)

- Generic Dollar Store sleep aid (sleep aid) (1.00 for 24 pills) (one pill contains 25 mg of diphenhydramine HCl)

- Generic Dollar Store Advil PM (pain reliever/sleep aid) (1.00 for 24 pills) (one pills contains Advil and 38 mg of diphenhydramine citrate)

- It's also worth noting that when it comes to Children's allergy medicine (name brand or generic) the only difference is that the dosage is cut in half (one teaspoon contains 12.5 mg if diphenhydramine HCl instead of the usual 25)

There are plenty of other brand names out there that contain Benadryl

You should also get in the habit of looking at the ingredients before you buy ANY medication (as well as stuff already in your house) and get to know them by their chemical names. There are lots of drugs with multiple uses and it's nice to know A. Exactly what you're getting and B. How to find exactly what you're looking for.

Fast forward a few weeks and I was on a train going from Austria to Germany (Amsterdam) and I got up to go to the bar (in the same car). I had unwittingly left the camera on my seat (I was pretty drunk) and when I came back
    
I told her it was mine but wouldn't believe me and refused to give me the camera back, it was a picture of me!    
    
So yeah
